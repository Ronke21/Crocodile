<text>The Nation (La Nation in French) is a municipality in Eastern Ontario, located within Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region, in the United Counties of Prescott and Russell. Formed in 1998, the municipality consists of the former townships of Caledonia, Cambridge and South Plantagenet, as well as the Village of St. Isidore.

The municipality is crossed by the South Nation River after which the municipality was named.

==Communities==

The township comprises the communities of Benoit, Bradley Creek, Caledonia Springs, Fenaghvale, Forest Park, Fournier, Franklins Corners, Gagnon, Johnsons Ferry, Lalonde, Limoges, Longtinville, Martels Corners, Mayerville, Parkers Corners, Proulx, Riceville, Routhier, Sandown, Skye, St. Albert, St. Amour, St. Bernardin, Ste-Rose-de-Prescott, St. Isidore and Velfranc. The township administrative offices are located north of Casselman on Route 500, with a satellite office in Fournier.

The ghost town of Lemieux, abandoned in the early 1990s, is also located within the municipality.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, The Nation had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The Nation also contains one of the larger concentrations of Francophones in Ontario. According to the 2016 Canadian Census, 64.7% of the population have French as their first language, while 31.7% have English as their first language.

==Attractions==
The Nation Municipality is home to Calypso Water Park near Limoges and the Alfred Bog. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has designated the Alfred Bog as &quot;a provincially significant wetland and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest.&quot; Species of interest include the palm warbler, northern pitcher-plant, pink lady&#x27;s slipper, cottongrass, bog elfin and bog copper butterflies, and ebony boghaunter dragonfly. It also hosts one of the most southerly herds of moose. The bog is open to the public with a boardwalk for nature walks.

The Prescott and Russell Recreational Trail goes through the township.

The Larose Forest is also partially located in this municipality.

<text>Rescue archaeology, sometimes called commercial archaeology, preventive archaeology, salvage archaeology, contract archaeology, developer-funded archaeology, or compliance archaeology, is state-sanctioned, archaeological survey and excavation carried out as part of the planning process in advance of construction or other land development. In Western Europe, excavation is the final stage in a sequence of activities that start with desk-based assessments of the archaeological potential through exploratory fieldwork: monument surveys, test pitting, shovel pitting, evaluations, and so forth. Other, less common causes for salvage digs can be looting and illegal construction.

Conditions leading to rescue archaeology could include, but are not limited to, road and other major construction, the floodplain of a proposed dam, or even before the onset of war. Unlike traditional survey and excavation, rescue archaeology must be undertaken at speed. Rescue archaeology is included in the broader categories of cultural resource management (CRM) and cultural heritage management (CHM).

==Background==
Rescue archaeology occurs on sites about to be destroyed but, on occasion, may include in situ preservation of any finds or protective measures taken to preserve an unexcavated site beneath a building. Urban areas with many overlaid years of habitation are often candidates for rescue archaeology.

The focus of early work was to set up organisations to undertake rescue excavations shortly before an area was disturbed by construction equipment. Archaeologists relied on the goodwill of the developer to provide the opportunity to record remains. In the present day, an archaeological survey may be required by planning process or building law, as with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in the UK. Common conditions required by planning authorities are archaeological field surveys, watching briefs, shovel test pits, trial trenching, and excavation. Guidance and standards of practice in the UK are largely monitored through the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA).

Contract or commercial archaeology services have sprung up to meet the needs of developers and to comply with local laws and planning regulations.

<doc id="422293" wikidata="Q2470952" url="?curid=422293" title="USS Sailfish (SS-192)">
<text>USS &quot;Sailfish&quot; (SS-192), was a US , originally named Squalus. As &quot;Squalus&quot;, the submarine sank off the coast of New Hampshire during test dives on 23 May 1939. The sinking drowned 26 crew members, but an ensuing rescue operation, using the McCann Rescue Chamber for the first time, saved the lives of the remaining 33 aboard. &quot;Squalus&quot; was salvaged in late 1939 and recommissioned as &quot;Sailfish&quot; in May 1940.

As &quot;Sailfish&quot;, the vessel conducted numerous patrols in the Pacific War during World War II, earning nine battle stars. She was decommissioned in October 1945 and later scrapped. Her conning tower is on display at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Squalus&quot;″s keel was laid on 18 October 1937 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, the only ship of the United States Navy named for the squalus, a type of shark. She was launched on 14 September 1938, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas C. Hart, wife of Admiral Thomas C. Hart, and commissioned on 1 March 1939 with Lieutenant Oliver F. Naquin in command.

==Sinking of &quot;Squalus&quot; and recommissioning as &quot;Sailfish&quot;==
On 12 May 1939, following a yard overhaul, &quot;Squalus&quot; began a series of test dives off Portsmouth, New Hampshire. After successfully completing 18 dives, she went down again off the Isles of Shoals on the morning of 23 May at . Failure of the main induction valve (the means of letting in fresh air when on the surface) caused the flooding of the aft torpedo room, both engine rooms, and the crew&#x27;s quarters, drowning 26 men immediately. Quick action by the crew prevented the other compartments from flooding. &quot;Squalus&quot; bottomed in of water.

&quot;Squalus&quot; was initially located by her sister boat, . The two submarines communicated using a telephone marker buoy until the cable parted. Divers from the submarine rescue ship began rescue operations under the direction of the salvage and rescue expert Lieutenant Commander Charles B. &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen, using the new McCann Rescue Chamber. The senior medical officer for the operations was Dr. Charles Wesley Shilling. Overseen by researcher Albert R. Behnke, the divers used recently developed heliox diving schedules and successfully avoided the cognitive impairment symptoms associated with such deep dives, thereby confirming Behnke&#x27;s theory of nitrogen narcosis. The divers rescued all 33 survivors (32 crew members and a civilian) on board the sunken submarine. Four enlisted divers, Chief Machinist&#x27;s Mate William Badders, Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Orson L. Crandall, Chief Metalsmith James H. McDonald, and Chief Torpedoman John Mihalowski, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their work during the rescue and subsequent salvage. The successful rescue of the &quot;Squalus&quot; survivors is in marked contrast to the loss of in Liverpool Bay in England just a week later, with four survivors from 104 people aboard.

The naval authorities felt raising &quot;Squalus&quot; was important, as she incorporated a succession of new design features. With a thorough investigation of why she sank, more confidence could be placed in the new construction, or alteration of existing designs could be undertaken when cheapest and most efficient to do so. Furthermore, given similar previous accidents in and (indeed, in , as far back as 1920), determining a cause was necessary.

The &quot;Squalus&quot; salvage unit was commanded by Rear Admiral Cyrus W. Cole, commandant of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, who supervised salvage officer Lieutenant Floyd A. Tusler from the Construction Corps. Cole also requested experienced Commander Henry Hartley as his technical aide. Tusler&#x27;s plan was to lift the submarine in three stages to prevent it from rising too quickly, out of control, with one end up, in which case the likelihood of it sinking again would be high. For 50 days, divers worked to pass cables underneath the submarine and attach pontoons for buoyancy. On 13 July 1939, the stern was raised successfully, but when the men attempted to free the bow from the hard blue clay, the vessel began to rise far too quickly, slipping its cables. Ascending vertically, the submarine broke the surface, and of the bow reached into the air for not more than ten seconds before she sank once again all the way to the bottom. Momsen said of the mishap, &quot;pontoons were smashed, hoses cut and I might add, hearts were broken.&quot; After 20 more days of preparation, with a radically redesigned pontoon and cable arrangement, the next lift was successful, as were two further operations. &quot;Squalus&quot; was towed into Portsmouth on 13 September, and decommissioned on 15 November. A total of 628 dives had been made in rescue and salvage operations.

==Operational history of &quot;Sailfish&quot;==
Renamed &quot;Sailfish&quot; on 9 February 1940, she became the first boat of the U.S. Navy named for the sailfish. After reconditioning, repair, and overhaul, she was recommissioned on 15 May 1940 with Lieutenant Commander Morton C. Mumma Jr. (Annapolis, class of 1930) in command.

With refit completed in mid-September, &quot;Sailfish&quot; departed Portsmouth on 16 January 1941 and headed for the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived at Pearl Harbor in early March, after refueling at San Diego. The submarine then sailed west to Manila where she joined the Asiatic Fleet until the attack on Pearl Harbor.

During the Pacific War, the captain of the renamed boat issued standing orders that if any man on the boat said the word &quot;Squalus&quot;, he was to be marooned at the next port of call. This led to crew members referring to their boat as &quot;Squailfish&quot;. That went over almost as well; a court martial was threatened for anyone heard using it.

===World War II===
====First five patrols: December 1941 – August 1942====
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Sailfish&quot; departed Manila on her first war patrol, destined for the west coast of Luzon. Early on 10 December, she sighted a landing force, supported by cruisers and destroyers, but could not gain firing position. On the night of 13 December, she made contact with two Japanese destroyers and began a submerged attack; the destroyers detected her, dropping several depth charges, while &quot;Sailfish&quot; fired two torpedoes. Despite a large explosion nearby, no damage was done, and the destroyers counterattacked with 18–20 depth charges. She returned to Manila on 17 December.

Her second patrol (now under the command of Richard G. Voge begun on 21 December, took the submarine to waters off Formosa. On the morning of 27 January 1942, off Halmahera, near Davao, she sighted a , making a daylight submerged attack with four torpedoes, and reporting the target was damaged, for which she got credit. However, the damage could not be assessed since the cruiser&#x27;s two escorts forced &quot;Sailfish&quot; to dive deep and run silent. Running at , the submarine eluded the destroyers and proceeded south toward Java. She arrived at Tjilatjap on 14 February for refueling and rearming.

Departing on 19 February for her third patrol, she headed through Lombok Strait to the Java Sea. After sighting the heavy cruiser and two escorts heading for Sunda Strait following the Allied defeat in the Battle of the Java Sea, &quot;Sailfish&quot; intercepted an enemy destroyer on 2 March. Following an unsuccessful attack, she was forced to dive deep to escape the ensuing depth-charge attack from the destroyer and patrol aircraft. That night, near the mouth of Lombok Strait, she spotted what appeared to be the aircraft carrier , escorted by four destroyers. &quot;Sailfish&quot; fired four torpedoes, scoring two hits. Leaving the target aflame and dead in the water, &quot;Sailfish&quot; dove, the escorts delivering 40 depth charges in the next 90 minutes. She eluded destroyers and aircraft and arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 19 March, to great fanfare, believed to be the first U.S. submarine to have sunk an enemy carrier. In reality, the &quot;Kaga&quot; was scuttled in June, 1942, after damage sustained during the Battle of Midway, in that vicinity. Postwar, &quot;Kaga&quot; was revealed to have been nowhere in the area of Lombok Strait, and the target had in fact been the aircraft ferry &quot;Kamogawa Maru&quot;, still a valuable target.

The Java Sea and Celebes Sea were the areas of &quot;Sailfish&quot;″s fourth patrol, from 22 March–21 May. After delivering 1,856 rounds of antiaircraft ammunition to &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s guerrillas&quot;, she made only one ship contact and was unable to attack the target before returning to Fremantle.

The submarine&#x27;s fifth patrol—from 13 June through 1 August—was off the coast of Indochina in the South China Sea. On 4 July, she intercepted and tracked a large freighter, but discovered the intended target was a hospital ship and held her fire. On 9 July, she intercepted and torpedoed a Japanese freighter. One of a pair of torpedoes struck home and the ship took a 15° list. As &quot;Sailfish&quot; went deep, a series of explosions was heard, and no further screw noises were detected. When the submarine surfaced in the area 90 minutes later, no ship was in sight. She was credited during the war with a 7000-ton ship, and although postwar examination of Japanese records confirmed no sinking in the area on that date, the &quot;Sailfish&quot; had damaged the Japanese transport ship &quot;Aobasan Maru&quot; (8811 GRT) off the coast of Indochina in position 11°31&#x27;N, 109°21&#x27;E.

&quot;Sailfish&quot; observed only one other enemy vessel before the end of the patrol.

====Sixth and seventh patrols: September 1942 – January 1943====
Shifting her base of operations to Brisbane, &quot;Sailfish&quot; (now under the command of John R. &quot;Dinty&quot; Moore) got underway for her sixth patrol on 13 September and headed for the western Solomon Islands. On the night of 17–18 September, she encountered eight Japanese destroyers escorting a cruiser, but she was unable to attack. On 19 September, she attacked a minelayer. The spread of three torpedoes missed, and &quot;Sailfish&quot; was forced to dive deep to escape the depth-charge counterattack. Eleven well-placed charges went off near the submarine, causing much minor damage. &quot;Sailfish&quot; returned to Brisbane on 1 November.

Underway for her seventh patrol on 24 November, &quot;Sailfish&quot; proceeded to the area south of New Britain. Following an unsuccessful attack on a destroyer on 2 December, the submarine made no other contacts until 25 December, when she believed she had scored a hit on a Japanese submarine. Postwar analysis of Japanese records could not confirm a sinking in the area. During the remainder of the patrol, she made unsuccessful attacks on a cargo ship and a destroyer before ending the patrol at Pearl Harbor on 15 January 1943.

====Eighth and ninth patrols: May–September 1943====
After an overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 27 January–22 April, &quot;Sailfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 30 April. Departing Hawaii on 17 May for her eighth patrol, she stopped off to fuel at Midway Island and proceeded to her station off the east coast of Honshū. Several contacts were made, but because of bad weather, were not attacked. On 15 June, she encountered two freighters off Todo Saki, escorted by three subchasers. Firing a spread of three stern torpedoes, she observed one hit. which stopped the &quot;maru&quot; dead in the water. &quot;Sailfish&quot; was driven down by the escort, but listened on her sound gear as &quot;Shinju Maru&quot; broke up and sank. Ten days later, she found a second convoy, three ships with a subchaser, and unusually, an aircraft, for escort. &quot;Sailfish&quot; once more fired three stern tubes, sinking &quot;Iburi Maru&quot;; in response, the subchaser, the aircraft, and three additional escorts, pinned her down in a gruelling depth-charge attack lasting 10 hours and 98 charges, but causing only slight damage. After shaking loose pursuit, she set course for Midway on 26 June, arriving there on 3 July.

Her ninth patrol (commanded by William R. Lefavour) lasted from 25 July–16 September and covered the Formosa Strait and waters off Okinawa. It produced only two contacts (a 2500-ton steamer at Naha, Okinawa, and a junk), but no worthwhile targets, and &quot;Sailfish&quot; thereafter returned to Pearl Harbor.

====Tenth patrol: November 1943 – January 1944====
After refit at Pearl Harbor, she departed (under the command of Robert E. McC. Ward) with a rejuvenated crew, on 17 November for her 10th patrol, which took her south of Honshū. Along the way, she suffered a &quot;hot run&quot; in tube eight (aft), and (after the skipper himself went over the side to inspect the damage) ejected the torpedo; the tube remained out of commission for the duration of the patrol.

After refueling at Midway, she was alerted by  of a fast convoy of Japanese ships before she arrived on station. Southeast of Yokosuka, on the night of 3 December, she made radar contact at . The group consisted of the Japanese aircraft carrier , a cruiser, and two destroyers. Despite high seas whipped up by typhoon winds, &quot;Sailfish&quot; maneuvered into firing position shortly after midnight on 3–4 December, dived to radar depth (just the radar aerial exposed), and fired four bow torpedoes at the carrier, at a range of , scoring two hits. She went deep to escape the escorting destroyers, which dropped 21 depth charges (only two close), reloaded, and at 02:00, surfaced to resume the pursuit. She found a mass of radar contacts, and a slow-moving target, impossible to identify in the miserable visibility. As dawn neared, she fired another spread of three bow &quot;fish&quot; from , scoring two more hits on the stricken carrier. Diving to elude the Japanese counterattack, which was hampered by the raging seas, &quot;Sailfish&quot; came to periscope depth, and at 07:58 saw the carrier lying dead in the water, listing to port and down by the stern. Preparations to abandon ship were in progress.

Later in the morning, &quot;Sailfish&quot; fired another spread of three torpedoes, from only , scoring two final hits. Loud internal explosions and breaking-up noises were heard while the submarine dived to escape a depth-charge attack. Abruptly, a cruiser appeared, and fearing that she would broach the surface, &quot;Sailfish&quot; went to , losing a chance at this new target. Shortly afterward, the carrier &quot;Chūyō&quot; () went to the bottom, the first aircraft carrier sunk by an American submarine in the war, and the only major Japanese warship sunk by enemy action in 1943. In an ironic twist, &quot;Chūyō&quot; was carrying American prisoners of war from , the same boat that had helped locate and rescue &quot;Sailfish&quot;—then &quot;Squalus&quot;—over four years before. Twenty of the 21 US crew members from &quot;Sculpin&quot; were killed. None, however, were of the original rescue crew; 1,250 Japanese were also killed.

After escaping a strafing attack by a Japanese fighter on 7 December, she made contact and commenced tracking two cargo ships with two escorts on the morning of 13 December, south of Kyūshū. That night, she fired a spread of four torpedoes at the two freighters. Two solid explosions were heard, including an internal secondary explosion. &quot;Sailfish&quot; heard &quot;Totai Maru&quot; () break up and sink as the destroyers made a vigorous but inaccurate depth-charge attack. When &quot;Sailfish&quot; caught up with the other freighter, she was dead in the water, but covered by a screen of five destroyers. Rather than face suicidal odds, the submarine quietly left the area. On the night of 20 December, she intercepted an enemy hospital ship, which she left unmolested.

On 21 December, in the approach to Bungo Suido (Bungo Channel), &quot;Sailfish&quot; intercepted six large freighters escorted by three destroyers. With five torpedoes left, she fired a spread of three stern tubes, scoring two hits on the largest target. Diving to escape the approaching destroyers, the submarine detected breaking-up noises as &quot;Uyo Maru&quot; (6400 GRT) went to the bottom; destroyers counterattacked with 31 depth charges, &quot;some very close&quot;. &quot;Sailfish&quot; terminated her tenth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 5 January 1944. She claimed three ships for 35,729 GRT, plus damage to one for 7000 tons, believed to be the most successful patrol by tonnage to date; postwar, it was reduced to two ships and (less &quot;Uyo Maru&quot;) 29,571 tons.

====Eleventh patrol: July–September 1944====
After an extensive overhaul at Mare Island—from 15–17 June—she returned to Hawaii and sailed on 9 July as part of a &quot;wolfpack&quot; (&quot;Moseley&#x27;s Maulers&quot;, commanded by Stan Moseley), with and , to prey on shipping in the Luzon–Formosa area. On the afternoon of 6 August, &quot;Sailfish&quot; and &quot;Greenling&quot; made contact with an enemy convoy. &quot;Sailfish&quot; maneuvered into firing position and fired a spread of three torpedoes at a mine layer. One hit caused the tanker to disintegrate into a column of water, smoke, and debris. It was not recorded in the postwar account. In fact, the &quot;Sailfish&quot; had sunk the Japanese &quot;Kinshu Maru&quot; (238 GRT) in Luzon Strait in position 20°09&#x27;N, 121°19&#x27;E.

Her next target was a battleship escorted by three destroyers, on which she made radar contact shortly after midnight on 18–19 August. At 01:35, after getting as close as she was able, , &quot;Sailfish&quot; fired all four bow tubes. One of the escorts ran into the path of two fish; the other two missed. While the destroyer must have been severely damaged or sunk, there was nothing in JANAC.

On 24 August, south of Formosa, &quot;Sailfish&quot; made radar contact with an enemy convoy consisting of four cargo ships escorted by two small patrol craft. Moving into firing position, &quot;Sailfish&quot; fired a salvo of four torpedoes, scoring two hits. The cargo ship &quot;Toan Maru&quot; (2100 GRT) was enveloped in a cloud of smoke and shortly afterward broke in two and sank. Surfacing after escaping a depth-charge attack, &quot;Sailfish&quot; closed on a second cargo ship of the convoy, scoring two hits out of four torpedoes fired. The submarine&#x27;s crew felt the cargo ship either had been sunk or badly damaged, but the sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar. &quot;Sailfish&quot; terminated her 11th patrol at Midway on 6 September; her wartime credit was four ships for 13,200 tons, a total reduced to just one of 2100 GRT (&quot;Toan Maru&quot;) postwar.

====Twelfth patrol: September–December 1944====
Her 12th patrol—from 26 September through 11 December—was conducted between Luzon and Formosa, in company with and .

After passing through the edge of a typhoon, &quot;Sailfish&quot; arrived on station to perform lifeguard duty. On 12 October, staying surfaced in full view of enemy attackers, she rescued 12 Navy fliers who had ditched their stricken aircraft after strikes against Japanese bases on Formosa. She sank a &quot;sampan&quot; and a patrol craft with her deck gun as the enemy craft tried to capture the downed aviators. The following day, she rescued another flier. The submarines pulled into Saipan, arriving on 24 October, to drop off their temporary passengers, refuel, and make minor repairs.

After returning to the patrol area with the wolf pack, she made an unsuccessful attack on a transport on 3 November. The following day, &quot;Sailfish&quot; damaged the Japanese destroyer &quot;Harukaze&quot; and Japanese landing ship &quot;T-111&quot; (890 tons) in Luzon Strait in position 20°08&#x27;N, 121°43&#x27;E, but was slightly damaged herself by a bomb from a patrol aircraft. With battle damage under control, &quot;Sailfish&quot; eluded her pursuers and cleared the area. After riding out a typhoon on 9–10 November, she intercepted a convoy on the evening of 24 November heading for Itbayat in the Philippines. After alerting &quot;Pomfret&quot; of the convoy&#x27;s location and course, &quot;Sailfish&quot; was moving into an attack position, when one of the escorting destroyers headed straight for her. &quot;Sailfish&quot; fired a three-torpedo spread &quot;down the throat&quot; and headed toward the main convoy. At least one hit was scored on the destroyer and her pip faded from the radar screen. Suddenly, &quot;Sailfish&quot; received an unwelcome surprise when she came under fire from the destroyer that she had believed to be sunk. &quot;Sailfish&quot; ran deep after ascertaining no hull damage had resulted from a near miss from the escort&#x27;s guns. For the next 4 hours, &quot;Sailfish&quot; was forced to run silent and deep as the Japanese kept up an uncomfortably accurate depth-charge attack. Finally, the submarine eluded the destroyers and slip away. Shortly, &quot;Sailfish&quot; headed for Hawaii, via Midway, and completed her 12th and final war patrol upon arriving at Pearl Harbor on 11 December. &quot;Sailfish&quot; had damaged the IJN destroyer , which had previously sunk , and also a landing ship.

====Return stateside====
Following refit, &quot;Sailfish&quot; departed Hawaii on 26 December and arrived at New London, via the Panama Canal, on 22 January 1945. For the next four and one-half months, she aided training out of New London. Next, she operated as a training ship at Guantanamo Bay from 9 June–9 August. After a six-week stay at Philadelphia Navy Yard, she arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 2 October for deactivation.

===Post war===
After being decommissioned on 27 October 1945, efforts by the city of Portsmouth and area residents to have the submarine kept intact as a memorial were not successful. Agreement was reached to have her conning tower saved, which was dedicated in November 1946 on Armistice Day, by John L. Sullivan, then Undersecretary of the Navy. The remainder of the submarine was initially scheduled to be a target in the atomic bomb tests or sunk by conventional ordnance. However, she was placed on sale in March 1948 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1948. The hulk was sold for scrapping to Luria Brothers of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 18 June 1948. Her conning tower still stands at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery as a memorial to her lost crewmen ().

==In media==
The 2001 television movie docudrama &quot;Submerged&quot;, directed by James Keach and starring Sam Neill as Charles B. &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen and James B. Sikking as Admiral Cyrus Cole, depicted the events surrounding the loss of USS &quot;Squalus&quot; and the rescue of her 33 survivors. The plot was written to closely follow the events of the sinking.

&quot;Submerged&quot; used models and sets originally constructed for the 2000 film &quot;U-571&quot;. The floating set used to in &quot;Submerged&quot; to represent both USS &quot;Squalus&quot; and USS &quot;Sculpin&quot; is the non-diving replica built in Malta as the &quot;modified&quot; for &quot;U-571&quot;, which also was shot in Malta. The replica is still afloat, moored in Marsa in the inner part of the Grand Harbour () at Malta.

In 2006, BBC TV presented a series of programs entitled &quot;Voyages of Discovery&quot;, the first of which, called &quot;Hanging by a Thread&quot;, told the story of the USS &quot;Squalus&quot; rescue mission, as narrated by Paul Rose.

<doc id="422296" wikidata="Q5345697" url="?curid=422296" title="Edward VII 2d Tyrian plum">
<text>The two pence (2d) Tyrian plum was a postage and revenue stamp produced by Britain in 1910 as a replacement for the existing two colour 2d stamp of King Edward VII.

One hundred thousand sheets, totalling 24,000,000 stamps, were printed by De La Rue and delivered to the post office stores for distribution to postmasters. The circulation of the new stamps was delayed while existing stocks of the current stamp were used up so that the change would take effect at one time and the amount of surplus stock of the old value would be kept to a minimum. However following the death of Edward VII on 6 May 1910, it was decided not to issue the new stamp and almost all the stock was destroyed. Only a few examples survive in private hands, making this stamp one of the great rarities of British philately.

A single used on cover example is known, which was sent by the then Prince of Wales, later King George V, to himself. This example is in the Royal Philatelic Collection.

Additionally, a complete imperforate registration sheet of 240 stamps is in the British Postal Museum &amp; Archive along with a perforated sheet of 139 stamps.

<text>The federal districts () are groupings of the federal subjects of Russia. Federal districts consist of a group of regions with various autonomy levels as per constitution, but the districts themselves are not mentioned by the constitution and are not autonomous, do not have administrative competences of their own, and do not manage regional affairs. They exist solely to monitor consistency between the federal and regional bodies of law, and ensure federal management of the civil service, judiciary, and federal agencies operating in the regions. The federal district system was established on 13 May 2000.

== List of federal districts ==

==History==
The federal districts of Russia were established by a decree issued by President Vladimir Putin on 13 May 2000 to facilitate the federal government&#x27;s control of the then 89 federal subjects across the country. 

On 19 January 2010, the new North Caucasian Federal District split from the Southern Federal District.

In March 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, the Crimean Federal District was established. The legality of this annexation is disputed by an overwhelming majority of countries. On 28 July 2016 the Crimean Federal District was abolished and merged into the Southern Federal District in order to improve governance.

In November 2018, Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai were moved from the Siberian Federal District to the Far Eastern Federal District in accordance with a decree issued by Putin. The Administrative Centre of the Far Eastern Federal District relocated from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok in December 2018.

<doc id="422308" wikidata="Q334398" url="?curid=422308" title="Yue Fei">
<text>Yue Fei (; March 24, 1103 – January 28, 1142), courtesy name Pengju (), was a Chinese military general of the Song dynasty and is remembered as a patriotic national hero, known for leading its forces in the wars in the 12th century between Southern Song and the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in northern China. Because of his warlike stance, he was put to death by the Southern Song government in 1142 under a frameup, after a negotiated peace was achieved with the Jin dynasty. Yue Fei is depicted in the &quot;Wu Shuang Pu&quot; by Jin Guliang.

Yue Fei&#x27;s ancestral home was in Xiaoti, Yonghe Village, Tangyin, Xiangzhou, Henan (in present-day Tangyin County, Anyang, Henan). He was granted the posthumous name Wumu () by Emperor Xiaozong in 1169, and later granted the noble title King of E () posthumously by the Emperor Ningzong in 1211. Since his death and after the fall of the Song dynasty in 1279, Yue Fei is widely seen as a culture hero in China; he has evolved into a paragon of loyalty in Chinese culture.

== Biographies ==
=== Biography of Yue Fei ===
A biography of Yue Fei, the &quot;Eguo Jintuo Zubian&quot; (), was written 60 years after his death by his grandson, the poet and historian Yue Ke () (1183post 1240). In 1346 it was incorporated into the &quot;History of Song&quot;, a 496-chapter record of historical events and biographies of noted Song dynasty individuals, compiled by Yuan dynasty prime minister Toqto&#x27;a and others. Yue Fei&#x27;s biography is found in the 365th chapter of the book and is numbered biography 124 in volume 365. Some later historians including Deng Guangming (1907–1998) now doubt the veracity of many of Yue Ke&#x27;s claims about his grandfather.

According to the &quot;History of Song&quot;, Yue Fei was named &quot;Fei&quot;, meaning to fly, because at the time he was born, &quot;a large bird like a swan landed on the roof of his house&quot;.

=== General Yue Fei ===
=== Chronicle of Yue, Prince of E of Song ===
The &quot;Chronicle of Yue, Prince of E of Song&quot; () was written by Qian Ruwen () in 1924.

== Birth and early life ==

Several sources state that Yue was born into a poor tenant farmer&#x27;s family in Tangyin County, Anyang prefecture, Henan province. The &quot;Biography of Yue Fei&quot; mentions a flood which displaced Yue Fei&#x27;s family during his childhood, but his father survived. It reads,

After [the death of his teacher Zhou Tong], [Yue Fei] would offer sacrifices at his tomb. His father praised him for his faithfulness and asked him, &quot;When you are employed to cope with the affairs of the time, will you then not have to sacrifice yourself for the empire and die for your duty?&quot; ()

Yue Fei&#x27;s father used his family&#x27;s plot of land for humanitarian efforts, but after it was destroyed in the flood, the young Yue Fei was forced to help his father toil in the fields to survive. Yue received most of his primary education from his father. In 1122 Yue joined the army, but had to return home later that year after the death of his father. In ancient China, a person was required by law to temporarily resign from their job when their parents died so they could observe the customary period of mourning. For instance, Yue would have had to mourn his father&#x27;s death for three years, but in all actually only 27 months. During this time, he would wear coarse mourning robes, caps, and slippers, while abstaining from silken garments. When his mother died in 1136, he retired from a decisive battle against the Jin dynasty for the mourning period, but he was forced to cut the bereavement short because his generals begged him to come back.

&quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan&quot; gives a very detailed fictional account of Yue&#x27;s early life. The novel states after being swept from Henan to Hubei, Yue and his mother are saved by the country squire Wang Ming () and are permitted to stay in Wang&#x27;s manor as domestic helpers. The young Yue Fei later becomes the adopted son and student of the Wang family&#x27;s teacher, Zhou Tong, a famous master of military skills. (Zhou Tong is not to be confused with the similarly named &quot;Little Tyrant&quot; in &quot;Water Margin&quot;.) Zhou teaches Yue and his three sworn brothers – Wang Gui (), Tang Huai () and Zhang Xian () – literary lessons on odd days and military lessons, involving archery and the eighteen weapons of war, on even days.

After years of practice, Zhou Tong enters his students into the Tangyin County military examination, in which Yue Fei wins first place by shooting a succession of nine arrows through the bullseye of a target 240 paces away. After this display of archery, Yue is asked to marry the daughter of Li Chun (), an old friend of Zhou and the county magistrate who presided over the military examination. However, Zhou soon dies of an illness and Yue lives by his grave through the winter until the second month of the new year when his sworn brothers come and tear it down, forcing him to return home and take care of his mother.

Yue eventually marries and later participates in the imperial military examination in the Song capital of Kaifeng. There, he defeats all competitors and even turns down an offer from Cai Gui (), the Prince of Liang, to be richly rewarded if he forfeits his chance for the military degree. This angers the prince and both agree to fight a private duel in which Yue kills the prince and is forced to flee the city for fear of being executed. Shortly thereafter, he joins the Song army to fight the invading armies of the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty.

The &quot;Yue Fei Biography&quot; states,

When [Yue] was born, a Peng flew crowing over the house, so his father named the child Fei&quot; [(飛 – &quot;flight&quot;)]&quot;. Before [Yue] was even a month old, the Yellow River flooded, so his mother got inside of the center of a clay jar and held on to baby Yue. The violent waves pushed the jar down river, where they landed ashore ... Despite his family&#x27;s poverty, [Yue Fei] was studious, and particularly favored the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; edition of the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; and the strategies of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi. ()

According to a book by martial arts master Liang Shouyu, &quot;[A] Dapeng is a great bird that lived in ancient China. Legend has it, that Dapeng Jinchi Mingwang was the guardian that stayed above the head of Gautama Buddha. Dapeng could get rid of all evil in any area. Even the Monkey King was no match for it. During the Song dynasty the government was corrupt and foreigners were constantly invading China. Sakyamuni sent Dapeng down to earth to protect China. Dapeng descended to Earth and was born as Yue Fei.&quot;

=== Martial training ===
The &quot;Biography of Yue Fei&quot; states, &quot;Yue Fei possessed supernatural power and before his adulthood, he was able to draw a bow of 300 catties () and a crossbow of eight stone (960 catties, ). Yue Fei learned archery from Zhou Tong. He learned everything and could shoot with his left and right hands.&quot; &quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan&quot; states Zhou teaches Yue and his sworn brothers archery and all of the eighteen weapons of war. This novel also says Yue was Zhou&#x27;s third student after Lin Chong and Lu Junyi of the 108 outlaws in &quot;Water Margin&quot;. The &quot;E Wang Shi&quot; records, &quot;When Yue Fei reached adulthood, his maternal grandfather, Yao Daweng (), hired a spear expert, Chen Guang, to teach Yue Fei spear fighting.&quot;

Both the &quot;Biography of Yue Fei&quot; and &quot;E Wang Shi&quot; mention Yue learning from Zhou and Chen at or before his adulthood. The Chinese character representing &quot;adulthood&quot; in these sources is &quot;ji guan&quot; (), an ancient Chinese term that means &quot;20 years old&quot; where a young man was able to wear a formal headdress as a social status of adulthood. So he gained all of his martial arts knowledge by the time he joined the army at the age of 19.

These chronicles do not mention Yue&#x27;s masters teaching him martial arts style; just archery, spearplay and military tactics. However non-historical or scholarly sources state, in addition to those already mentioned, Zhou Tong taught Yue other skills such as hand-to-hand combat and horseback riding. Yet again, these do not mention any specific martial arts style. One legend says Zhou took young Yue to an unspecified place to meet a Buddhist hermit who taught him the Emei Dapeng qigong () style. This is supposedly the source of his legendary strength and martial arts abilities. According to thirteenth generation lineage &quot;Tai He&quot; (&quot;Great Harmony&quot;) Wudangquan master &quot;Fan Keping&quot; (), Zhou Tong was a master of various &quot;hard qigong&quot; exercises.

=== Yue Fei&#x27;s tattoo ===
According to historical records and legend, Yue had the four Chinese characters &quot;jin zhong bao guo&quot; () tattooed across his back. The &quot;Biography of Yue Fei&quot; says after Qin Hui sent agents to arrest Yue and his son, he was taken before the court and charged with treason, but
Yue ripped his jacket to reveal the four tattooed characters of &quot;serve the country with the utmost loyalty&quot; on his back. This proved that he was clearly innocent of the charges.

Later fictionalizations of Yue&#x27;s biography would build upon the tattoo. For instance, one of his earliest Ming era novels titled &quot;The Story of King Yue Who Restored the Song dynasty&quot; () states that after the Jurchen armies invaded China, young heroes in Yue&#x27;s village suggest that they join the bandits in the mountains. However, Yue objects and has one of them tattoo the aforementioned characters on his back. Whenever others want to join the bandits, he flashes them the tattoo to change their minds.

The common legend of Yue receiving the tattoo from his mother first appeared in &quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan,&quot; a historical novel. In chapter 21 titled &quot;By a pretext Wang Zuo swore brotherhood, by tattoos Lady Yue instructed her son&quot;, Yue denounces the pirate chief Yang Yao () and passes on a chance to become a general in his army. Yue Fei&#x27;s mother then tells her son, &quot;I, your mother, saw that you did not accept recruitment of the rebellious traitor, and that you willingly endure poverty and are not tempted by wealth and status ... But I fear that after my death, there may be some unworthy creature who will entice you ... For these reason ... I want to tattoo on your back the four characters &#x27;Utmost&#x27;, &#x27;Loyalty&#x27;, &#x27;Serve&#x27; and &#x27;Nation&#x27; ... The Lady picked up the brush and wrote out on his spine the four characters for &#x27;serving the nation with the utmost loyalty&#x27; ... [So] she bit her teeth, and started pricking. Having finished, she painted the characters with ink mixed with vinegar so that the colour would never fade.&quot;

However, the truthfulness of this legend is disputed by modern historians. Documentation before the Qing dynasty record that Yue Fei had hired a tattoo artist to tattoo the four characters on his back. Such documentations appeared in Wumu Jingzhong Zhuan, a novel published in the Ming dynasty, while Shuo Yue Quanzhuan (General Yue Fei) was published in the Qing dynasty. 

The Kaifeng Jews, one of many pockets of Chinese Jews living in ancient China, refer to this tattoo in two of their three stele monuments created in 1489, 1512, and 1663. The first mention appeared in a section of the 1489 stele referring to the Jews&#x27; &quot;Boundless loyalty to the country and Prince&quot;. The second appeared in a section of the 1512 stele about how Jewish soldiers and officers in the Chinese armies were &quot;boundlessly loyal to the country&quot;.

=== Portrait ===
Southern Song era artist Liu Songnian () (1174–1224), who was best known for his realistic works, painted a picture, &quot;Four Generals of the Restoration&quot; (). The group portrait shows eight people – four generals and four attendants. Starting from the left: attendant, Yue Fei, attendant, Zhang Jun (), Han Shizhong (), attendant, Liu Guangshi (), and attendant.

According to history professor He Zongli of Zhejiang University, the painting shows Yue was more of a scholarly-looking general with a shorter stature and chubbier build than the statue of him currently displayed in his tomb in Hangzhou, which portrays him as being tall and skinny. Shen Lixin, an official with the Yue Fei Temple Administration, holds the portrait of Yue Fei from the &quot;Four Generals of the Restoration&quot; to be the most accurate likeness of the general in existence.

=== Character ===
In his &quot;From Myth to Myth: The Case of Yüeh Fei&#x27;s Biography&quot;, noted Sinologist Hellmut Wilhelm concluded that Yue Fei purposely patterned his life after famous Chinese heroes from dynasties past and that this ultimately led to his martyrdom. Apart from studying literature under his father Yue He (), Yue Fei loved to read military classics. He favored the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; commentary on the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; and the strategies of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi. Although his literacy afforded him the chance to become a scholar, which was a position held in much higher regard than the common soldiery during the Song dynasty, Yue chose the military path because there had never been any tradition of civil service in his family. Therefore he had no reason to study Confucian classics in order to surpass the accomplishments of his ancestors or to raise his family&#x27;s social status to the next level. His fourth generation ancestor, Yue Huan (), had served as a &quot;lingshi&quot; () (essentially a low-level functionary), but he was never a full-fledged member of the civil service rank. A second theory is that he joined the military in the hopes of emulating his favorite heroes.

Scholars were always welcome in Yue Fei&#x27;s camp. He allowed them to come and tell stories and deeds of past heroes to bolster the resolve of his men. This way he was able to teach them about the warriors that he had constructed his own life after. He also hoped that one of these scholars would record his own deeds so he would become a peer amongst his idols. He is recorded in saying that he wished to be considered the equal of Guan Yu and other such famous men from the Three Kingdoms period. Yue succeeded in this endeavor since later &quot;official mythology&quot; placed him on the same level as Guan Yu.

Yue was careful to conduct himself as the ideal Confucian gentleman at all times for fear that any misconduct would be recorded and criticized by people of later dynasties. However he had his faults. He had a problem with alcohol during the early part of his military career. Yue drank in great excess because he believed it fitted the image of heroes of old. However once he nearly killed a colleague in a drunken rage, the emperor made him promise not to drink any more until the Jurchen invaders had been driven away.

=== Family ===
According to &quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan&quot;, Yue had five sons and one daughter. The &quot;History of Song&quot; records that Yue Yun (; 1119–1142) was adopted by Yue Fei at the age of 12 whilst others claim he was his biological son; Yue Lei (), the second, succeeded to his father&#x27;s post; Yue Ting () was the third; Yue Lin () was the fourth; and Yue Zhen (), the fifth, was still young at the time of his father&#x27;s death. Yue Yinping was Yue Fei&#x27;s daughter. The novel states she committed suicide after her father&#x27;s death and became a fairy in heaven. However, history books do not mention her name and therefore she should be considered a fictional character. Yue Fei married the daughter of Magistrate Li in 1119 when he was 16 years old. However, the account of his marriage is fictional.

The &quot;Biography of Yue Fei&quot; states that Yue left his ailing mother with his first wife while he went to fight the Jin armies. However she &quot;left him (and his mother) and remarried&quot;. He later took a second wife and even discussed &quot;affairs&quot; pertaining to his military career with her. He truly loved her, but his affection for her was second to his desire to rid China of the Jurchen invaders. Her faithfulness to him and his mother was strengthened by the fear that any infidelity or lacking in her care of Lady Yue would result in reprisal.

Yue forbade his sons from having concubines, although he almost took one himself. Even though she was presented by a friend, he did not accept her because she laughed when he asked her if she could &quot;share the hardships of camp life&quot; with him. He knew she was liberal and would have sex with the other soldiers.

Though not mentioned in the memoir written by Yue Fei&#x27;s grandson, some scholarly sources claim Yue had a younger brother named Yue Fan (). He later served in the army under his brother and died in battle in 1132.

=== Military record ===

The son of an impoverished farmer from northern China, Yue Fei joined the Song military in 1122. Yue briefly left the army when his father died in 1123, but returned in 1126. After reenlisting, he fought to suppress rebellions by local Chinese warlords responsible for looting in northern China. Local uprisings had diverted needed resources away from the Song&#x27;s war against the Jin. Yue participated in defending Kaifeng during the second siege of the city by the Jin in 1127. After Kaifeng fell, he joined an army in Jiankang tasked with defending the Yangtze. This army prevented the Jurchens from advancing to the river in 1129. His rising reputation as a military leader attracted the attention of the Song court. In 1133, he was made the general of the largest army near the Central Yangtze. Between 1134 and 1135, he led a counteroffensive against Qi, a puppet state supported by the Jin, and secured territories that had been conquered by the Jurchens. He continued to advance in rank, and to increase the size of his army as he repeatedly led successful offensives into northern China. Several other generals were also successful against the Jin dynasty, and their combined efforts secured the survival of the Song dynasty. Yue, like most of them, was committed to recapturing northern China.

&quot;Stone Lake: The Poetry of Fan Chengda 1126–1193&quot; states, &quot;...Yue Fei ([1103]-1141)...repelled the enemy assaults in 1133 and 1134, until in 1135 the now confident Song army was in a position to recover all of north China from the Jin dynasty ... [In 1140,] Yue Fei initiated a general counterattack against the Jin armies, defeating one enemy after another until he set up camp within range of the Northern Song dynasty&#x27;s old capital city, Kaifeng, in preparation for the final assault against the enemy. Yet in the same year Qin [Hui] ordered Yue Fei to abandon his campaign, and in 1141 Yue Fei was summoned back to the Southern Song capital. It is believed that the emperor then ordered Yue Fei to be hanged.&quot;
==== Six methods for deploying an army ====
Yue Ke () states his grandfather had six special methods for deploying an army effectively:

; Careful selection: He relied more on small numbers of well-trained soldiers than he did large masses of the poorly trained variety. In this way, one superior soldier counted for as much as one hundred inferior soldiers. One example used to illustrate this was when the armies of Han Ching and Wu Xu were transferred into Yue&#x27;s camp. Most of them had never seen battle and were generally too old or unhealthy for sustaining prolonged troop movement and engagement of the enemy. Once Yue had filtered out the weak soldiers and sent them home, he was only left with a meager thousand able-bodied soldiers. However, after some months of intense training, they were ready to perform almost as well as the soldiers who had served under Yue for years.

; Careful training: When his troops were not on military campaigns to win back lost Chinese territory in the north, Yue put his men through intense training. Apart from troop movement and weapons drills, this training also involved them leaping over walls and crawling through moats in full battle garb. The intensity of the training was such that the men would not even try to visit their families if they passed by their homes while on movement and even trained on their days off.

; Justice in rewards and punishments: He rewarded his men for their merits and punished them for their boasting or lack of training. Yue once gave a foot soldier his own personal belt, silver dinner ware, and a promotion for his meritorious deeds in battle. While on the reverse, he once ordered his son Yue Yun to be decapitated for falling off his horse after failing to jump a moat. His son was only saved after Yue&#x27;s officers begged his mercy. There were a number of soldiers that were either dismissed or executed because they boasted of their skills or failed to follow orders.

; Clear orders: He always delivered his orders in a simple manner that was easy for all of his soldiers to understand. Whoever failed to follow them were severely punished.

; Strict discipline: While marching about the countryside, he never let his troops destroy fields or to pillage towns or villages. He made them pay a fair price for goods and made sure crops remained intact. A soldier once stole a hemp rope from a peasant so he could tie a bale of hay with it. When Yue discovered this, he questioned the soldier and had him executed.

; Close fellowship with his men: He treated all of his men like equals. He ate the same food as they did and slept out in the open as they did. Even when a temporary shelter was erected for him, he made sure several soldiers could find room to sleep inside before he found a spot of his own. When there was not enough wine to go around, he would dilute it with water so every soldier would receive a portion.

== Death ==

In 1126, several years before Yue became a general, the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty invaded northern China, forcing the Song dynasty out of its capital Kaifeng and capturing Emperor Qinzong of Song, who was sent into captivity in Huining Prefecture. This marked the end of the Northern Song dynasty, and the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty under Emperor Gaozong.

Yue fought a long campaign against the invading Jurchen in an effort to retake northern China. Just as he was threatening to attack and retake Kaifeng, officials advised Emperor Gaozong to recall Yue to the capital and sue for peace with the Jurchen. Fearing that a defeat at Kaifeng might cause the Jurchen to release Emperor Qinzong, threatening his claim to the throne, Emperor Gaozong followed their advice, sending 12 orders in the form of 12 gold plaques to Yue Fei, recalling him back to the capital. Knowing that a success at Kaifeng could lead to internal strife, Yue submitted to the emperor&#x27;s orders and returned to the capital, where he was imprisoned and where Qin Hui would eventually arrange for him to be executed on false charges.

There are conflicting views on how Yue died. According to &quot;The History of China: (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations)&quot; and other sources, Yue died in prison. The &quot;Chronicle of Yue, Prince of E of Song&quot; says he was killed in prison. &quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan&quot; states he was strangled to death. It reads, &quot;...[Yue Fei] strode in long steps to the Pavilion of Winds and Waves ... The warders on both sides picked up the ropes and strangled the three men [Yue Fei, Yue Yun, and Zhang Xian (), Yue&#x27;s subordinate] without further ado ... At the time Lord Yue was 39 years of age and the young lord Yue Yun 23. When the three men returned to Heaven, suddenly a fierce wind rose up wildly and all the fires and lights were extinguished. Black mists filled the sky and sand and pebbles were blown about.&quot;

The &quot;Secrets of Eagle Claw Kung Fu: Ying Jow Pai&quot; comments, &quot;Finally, [Yue Fei] received the &#x27;Twelfth Golden Edict&#x27; [from the emperor calling him back to the capital], which if ignored meant banishment. Patriotism demanded that he obey. On his way back to the capital he stopped to rest at a pavilion. Qin Hui anticipated Yue Fei&#x27;s route and sent some men to lie in wait. When Yue Fei arrived, Qin&#x27;s men ambushed and murdered him. Just 39 years old, Yue Fei like many good men in history, had a swift, brilliant career, then died brutally while still young.&quot;

According to &quot;A Chinese Biographical Dictionary&quot;, &quot;[Father and son] had not been two months in confinement when Qin Hui resolved to rid himself of his enemy. He wrote out with his own hand an order for the execution of Yue Fei, which was forthwith carried into effect; whereupon he immediate reported that Yue Fei had died in prison&quot;, which meant that Qin Hui had Yue and his son executed but reported they both died in captivity.

Other sources say he was poisoned to death. Still, a great number simply say he was executed, murdered, or &quot;treacherously assassinated&quot;.

After Yue&#x27;s execution, a prison officer, Wei Shun (), who admired Yue&#x27;s character, stole his body and secretly buried it at the Nine Song Cong Temple () located outside the Song capital.

=== Qin Hui&#x27;s posthumous punishment ===
&quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan&quot; states after having Yue Fei, Yue Yun, Zhang Xian arrested under false charges, Qin Hui and his wife, Lady Wang (), were sitting by the &quot;eastern window&quot;, warming themselves by the fire, when he received a letter from the people calling for the release of Yue Fei. Qin was worried because after nearly two months of torture, he could not get Yue to admit to treason and would eventually have to let him go. However, after a servant girl brought fresh oranges into the room, Lady Wang devised a plan to execute Yue. She told Qin to slip an execution notice inside the skin of an orange and send it to the judge presiding over Yue&#x27;s case. This way, Yue and his companions would be put to death before the emperor or Qin himself would have to rescind an open order of execution. This conspiracy became known as the &quot;East Window Plot&quot;. A novel about this incident, titled &quot;Dong Chuang Ji&quot; (; &quot;Tale of the Eastern Window&quot;), was written during the Ming dynasty by an anonymous writer.

When confronted by Han Shizhong on what crime Yue had committed, Qin Hui replied, &quot;Though it isn&#x27;t sure whether there is something that he did to betray the dynasty, maybe there is.&quot; The phrase &quot;perhaps there is&quot;, &quot;no reason needed&quot;, &quot;groundless&quot;, or &quot;baseless&quot; () has entered the Chinese language as a proverb to refer to fabricated charges, which also means &#x27;trumped-up charge&#x27;, &#x27;setup&#x27;, &#x27;frameup&#x27;, or &#x27;concocted charge&#x27; in English.

Decades later, his grandson, Yue Ke (), had retrieved documentary evidence of his grandfather&#x27;s achievements, and published an adulatory biography of him. In 1162 Emperor Xiaozong of Song posthumously dissolved his unjust charges and rehabilitated his honours. For their part in Yue&#x27;s death, iron statues of Qin Hui, Lady Wang, and two of Qin&#x27;s subordinates, Moqi Xie () and Zhang Jun (), were made to kneel before Yue Fei&#x27;s tomb (located by the West Lake, Hangzhou). For centuries, these statues were cursed, spat on, and urinated upon by people. The original castings in bronze were damaged, but later were replaced by images cast in iron, but these were similarly damaged. However now, in modern times, these statues are protected as historical relics. There is a poem hanging on the gate surrounding the statues that reads, &quot;The green hill is fortunate to be the burial ground of a loyal general, the white iron was innocent to be cast into the statues of traitors.&quot; Emperor Xiaozong&#x27;s court gave proper burial to his remains after Wei Shun&#x27;s family revealed its location; Wei Shun was then posthumously honored at Yue Fei&#x27;s hometown at Tangyin County, and a statue of him was made standing at its Yue Fei Temple. A [tomb] was put up in his memory, and he was designated &quot;Wumu&quot; (; &quot;Martial and Stern&quot;). In 1179 he was canonized as &quot;Zhongwu&quot; (; &quot;Loyal and Martial&quot;).

According to the novel &quot;Xi You Bu&quot;, a satire of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, written in 1641 by the scholar Dong Ruoyu (also known as Dong Yue, 1620–1686), the Monkey King enthusiastically serves in hell as the trial prosecutor of Qin Hui, while Yue Fei becomes the Monkey King&#x27;s third master (by teaching the latter Confucian methods). At one point, the Monkey King asks the spirit of Yue Fei if he would like to drink Qin&#x27;s blood, but he politely declined.

== Talents ==
=== Martial arts ===
The two styles most associated with Yue are Eagle Claw and &quot;xingyiquan&quot;. One book states Yue created Eagle Claw for his enlisted soldiers and &quot;xingyiquan&quot; for his officers. Legend has it that Yue studied in the Shaolin Monastery with a monk named Zhou Tong and learned the &quot;elephant&quot; style of boxing, a set of hand techniques with great emphasis on &quot;qinna&quot; (joint-locking). Other tales say he learned this style elsewhere outside the temple under the same master. Yue eventually expanded elephant style to create the &quot;Yibai Lingba Qinna&quot; (; &quot;108 Locking Hand Techniques&quot;) of the &quot;Ying Sao&quot; (Eagle Hands) or &quot;Ying Kuen&quot; (Eagle Fist). After becoming a general in the imperial army, Yue taught this style to his men and they were very successful in battle against the armies of the Jin dynasty. Following his wrongful execution and the disbandment of his armies, Yue&#x27;s men supposedly traveled all over China spreading the style, which eventually ended right back in Shaolin where it began. Later, a monk named Li Quan () combined this style with &quot;fanziquan&quot;, another style attributed to Yue, to create the modern day form of Northern &quot;Ying Jow Pai&quot; boxing.

According to legend, Yue combined his knowledge of internal martial arts and spearplay learned from Zhou Tong (in Shaolin) to create the linear fist attacks of &quot;xingyiquan&quot;. One book claims he studied and synthesized Buddhism&#x27;s Tendon Changing and Marrow Washing qigong systems to create &quot;xingyiquan&quot;. On the contrary, proponents of &quot;wudangquan&quot; believe it is possible that Yue learned the style in the Wudang Mountains that border his home province of Henan. The reasons they cite for this conclusion are that he supposedly lived around the same time and place as Zhang Sanfeng, the founder of tai chi; &quot;xingyiquan&quot;&#x27;s five fist attacks, which are based on the Five Chinese Elements theory, are similar to tai chi&#x27;s &quot;Yin-yang theory&quot;; and both theories are Taoist-based and not Buddhist. The book &quot;Henan Orthodox Xingyiquan&quot;, written by Pei Xirong () and Li Ying&#x27;ang (), states &quot;xingyiquan&quot; master Dai Longbang

... wrote the &#x27;Preface to Six Harmonies Boxing&#x27; in the 15th reign year of the Qianlong Emperor [1750]. Inside it says, &#x27;... when [Yue Fei] was a child, he received special instructions from Zhou Tong. He became extremely skilled in the spear method. He used the spear to create methods for the fist. He established a method called Yi Quan. Mysterious and unfathomable, followers of old did not have these skills. Throughout the Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties few had his art. Only Ji Gong had it. ()

The man &quot;Ji Gong&quot; mentioned above, better known as Ji Jike () or Ji Longfeng (), is said to have trained in Shaolin Monastery for ten years as a young man and was matchless with the spear. As the story goes, he later traveled to Xongju Cave on Mount Zhongnan to receive a boxing manual written by Yue Fei, from which he learned &quot;xingyiquan&quot;. However, some believe Ji actually created the style himself and attributed it to Yue Fei because he was fighting the Manchus, descendants of the Jurchens who Yue had struggled against. Ji supposedly created it after watching a battle between an eagle and a bear during the Ming dynasty. Other sources say he created it while training in Shaolin. He was reading a book and looked up to see two roosters fighting, which inspired him to imitate the fighting styles of animals. Both versions of the story (eagle / bear and roosters) state he continued to study the actions of animals and eventually increased the cadre of animal forms.

Several other martial arts have been attributed to Yue Fei, including Yuejiaquan (Yue Family Boxing), Fanziquan (Tumbling Boxing), and Chuōjiǎo quan (Feet-Poking Boxing), among others. The &quot;Fanzi Boxing Ballad&quot; says: &quot;Wumu has passed down the Fanziquan which has mystery in its straightforward movements.&quot; &quot;Wumu&quot; () was a posthumous name given to Yue after his death. One Chuojiao legend states Zhou Tong learned the style from its creator, a wandering Taoist named Deng Liang (), and later passed it onto Yue Fei, who is considered to be the progenitor of the style.

Besides martial arts, Yue is also said to have studied traditional Chinese medicine. He understood the essence of Hua Tuo&#x27;s &quot;Wu Qin Xi&quot; (; &quot;Five Animal Frolics&quot;) and created his own form of &quot;medical qigong&quot; known as the &quot;Ba Duan Jin&quot; (; &quot;Eight Pieces of Brocade&quot;). It is considered a form of &quot;Waidan&quot; (; &quot;External Elixir&quot;) medical qigong.
He taught this qigong to his soldiers to help keep their bodies strong and well-prepared for battle. One legend states that Zhou Tong took young Yue to meet a Buddhist hermit who taught him &quot;Emei Dapeng&quot; Qigong (). His training in Dapeng Qigong was the source of his great strength and martial arts abilities. Modern practitioners of this style say it was passed down by Yue.

==== Connection to Praying Mantis boxing ====
According to &quot;Shuo Yue Quanzhuan&quot;, Lin Chong and Lu Junyi of the 108 outlaws in &quot;Water Margin&quot; were former students of Yue&#x27;s teacher Zhou Tong. One legend states Zhou learned Chuōjiǎo boxing from its originator Deng Liang () and then passed it onto Yue Fei, who is sometimes considered the progenitor of the style. Chuojiao is also known as the &quot;Water Margin Outlaw style&quot; and &quot;Yuanyang Tui&quot; (; &quot;Mandarin Duck Leg&quot;). In chapter 29 of &quot;Water Margin&quot;, titled &quot;Wu Song beats Jiang the Door God in a drunken stupor&quot;, it mentions Wu Song, another of Zhou&#x27;s fictional students, using the &quot;Jade Circle-Steps with Duck and Drake feet&quot;. A famous folklore Praying Mantis manuscript, which describes the fictional gathering of eighteen martial arts masters in Shaolin, lists Lin Chong (#13) as a master of &quot;Mandarin ducks kicking technique&quot;. This creates a folklore connection between Yue and Mantis boxing.

Lineage Mantis master Yuen Man Kai openly claims Zhou Tong taught Lin Chong and Lu Junyi the &quot;same school&quot; of martial arts that was later combined with the aforementioned seventeen other schools to create Mantis fist. However, he believes Mantis fist was created during the Ming dynasty, and was therefore influenced by these eighteen schools from the Song dynasty. He also says Lu Junyi taught Yan Qing the same martial arts as he learned from Zhou Tong. Yuen further comments that Zhou Tong later taught Yue Fei the same martial art and that Yue was the originator of the mantis move &quot;Black Tiger Stealing Heart&quot;.

=== Poetry ===
At the age of 30, Yue supposedly wrote his most celebrated poem, &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; (&quot;Entirely Red River&quot;) with a subtitle of &quot;Xie Huai&quot; (&quot;Writing about What I Thought&quot;). This poem reflects the raw hatred he felt towards the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty, as well as the sorrow he felt when his efforts to recoup northern lands lost to Jin were halted by Southern Song officials of the &quot;Peace Faction&quot;. However, several modern historians, including the late Princeton University Prof. James T. C. Liu, believe certain phrasing in the poem dates its creation to the early 16th century, meaning Yue did &quot;not&quot; write it.

Yue Fei is also the author of at least two other poems, &quot;Xiao Chong Shan&quot; (&quot;Small Hills&quot;) and another &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; with a subtitle of &quot;Deng Huang He Lou You Gan&quot; (&quot;My Feelings When I Was Climbing the Yellow Crane Pavilion&quot;).

== Descendants ==
Among Yue Fei&#x27;s descendants was Yue Shenglong () and his son the Qing dynasty official Yue Zhongqi, who served as Minister of Defence and Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor. Yue Zhongqi conquered Tibet for the Qing during the Dzungar–Qing War and attacked the Dzungars at Ürümqi in Xinjiang. The Oirats were battled against by Yue Zhongqi. Yue Zhongqi lived at the Ji Xiaolan Residence.

Another notable descendant of Yue Fei was Yue Yiqin, a flying ace of the Republic of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

In 2011, two Yue descendants, Yue Jun and Yue Haijun, with six members of their clan, protested Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum&#x27;s Qin Hui statue, which indicates that even after centuries, the Yue family still hates Qin Hui and his conspirators for their ancestor&#x27;s plight. It has been reported that male members of the Yue family were not allowed to marry anyone whose surname was Qin until 1949, and genealogical records attest that this rule was rarely broken prior to its nullification. In 2017, it was reported that were 1.81 million descendants of Yue Fei in China, and the number of Yue Fei&#x27;s descendants in Anhui alone has grown to more than 1,003,000.

== Culture hero ==
Yue Fei&#x27;s stature in Chinese history rose to that of a national culture hero after his execution. Qin Hui, and in some cases Emperor Gaozong, were blamed by later historians for their supposed role in Yue Fei&#x27;s execution and conciliatory stance with the Jin dynasty. The allegations that Qin Hui conspired with the Jin to execute Yue Fei are popular in Chinese literature, but have never been proven. The real Yue Fei differed from the later myths that grew from his exploits. The portrayal of Yue as a scholar-general is only partially true. He was a skilled general, and may have been partially literate in Classical Chinese, but he was not an erudite Confucian scholar. Contrary to traditional legends, Yue was not the sole Chinese general engaged in the offensive against the Jurchens. He was one of many generals that fought against the Jin in northern China, and unlike Yue Fei, some of his peers were genuine members of the scholarly elite. Many of the exaggerations of Yue Fei&#x27;s life can be traced to a biography written by his grandson, Yue Ke. Yue Fei&#x27;s status as a culture hero strengthened in the Yuan dynasty and had a large impact on Chinese culture. Temples and shrines devoted to Yue Fei were constructed in the Ming dynasty. A Chinese World War II anthem alludes to lyrics said to have been written by Yue Fei.

He also sometimes appears as a door god in partnership with the deity Wen Taibao.

At certain points in time, Yue Fei ceased to be a national hero, such as in 2002, when the official guidelines for history teachers said that he could no longer carry the title. This was because Yue Fei had defended China from the Jurchen people, whose descendants, the Manchu people, are presently considered to be a part of the Chinese nation. Therefore, concern for the &quot;unity of nationalities&quot; in China prevailed, as Yue Fei was seen as representing only one subgroup within China, and not the &quot;entire Chinese nation as presently defined&quot;. However, both the Chinese Ministry of Education and the Minister of Defence deny such claims and still clearly address Yue Fei as a national hero of China. The Chinese Communist Party also continues to treat Yue Fei as a national hero of China.

=== Modern references ===
The ROCS &quot;Yueh Fei&quot; (FFG-1106), a &quot;Cheng Kung&quot;-class guided-missile frigate of the Republic of China Navy, is named after Yue.

The author Guy Gavriel Kay cites Yue Fei as having inspired the character Ren Daiyan in his novel &quot;River of Stars&quot; (), which is set in a fantasy world based on Song Dynasty China.

Yue Fei is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI&quot; by Koei.

<text>Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who is a Canadian series of 60-second public service announcements profiling Canadian animals, produced by Environment Canada Wildlife Service and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in the 1960s and 70s, and re-launched by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in the 2000s.

==Format==
The &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot; series was commissioned in 1962 by the Canadian Wildlife Service, as a way to generate interest in Canada&#x27;s wildlife through a series of short, one-minute vignettes, broadcast during commercial breaks. The series, produced for the CWS by the National Film Board, has been airing on Canadian television since 1963.

In the original announcements, a distinctive refrain of flute music (John Cacavas&#x27; &quot;Flute Poem&quot;) opens the ad, and is accompanied by the low-key style of the narrator, John Livingston (originally the executive director of the Canadian Audubon Society), describing the animal over footage of it taken in the wild.

The end of each message, where viewers were reminded to contact the Canadian Wildlife Service for additional information, varied. The earliest installments from 1963 concluded with, &quot;For a more complete story on the [animal], why not contact the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa?&quot; After the series was introduced in colour, it concluded with, &quot;For more information on the [animal], contact the Canadian Wildlife Service, in Ottawa.&quot; Newer segments in the late-1970s and 1980s ended with, &quot;For more information on the [animal], why not contact the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa?&quot;, with later instalments including its postal code, K1A 0H3. Viewers requesting information received a four-page, illustrated brochure providing more details on the featured animal.

By the early-1990s, the series received about $3.6 million in free publicity, and over a million leaflets were sent out to inquiring viewers.

A French version of this series was also produced, as Merveilles de la faune (&quot;Wonders of Wildlife&quot;) or Faune et flore du pays (&quot;The country&#x27;s fauna and flora&quot;).

In 2003, the Canadian Wildlife Federation, in cooperation with the Government of Canada, began producing new episodes of &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, featuring two versions:
* those containing the quiet narrative of the original series of commercials
* those containing modern background music, directed at younger viewers

These versions, now available as 30- or 60-second installments, are often hosted on-camera and voiced by a female Canadian Wildlife Service worker (Jody Gienow), concluding with, &quot;To learn more about [subject], and how you can protect it, visit &quot;hww.ca&quot;. The initial animals featured in the new series included the polar bear, the monarch butterfly, the leatherback sea turtle, and the loon.

In both cases, the new &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot; narrative includes suggestions for conservation along with the description of the animal and its behavior.

==Presumed lost installments==
In July 2013, it was announced that the first four installments of &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, released in the Summer of 1963, were presumed lost, as the Canadian Wildlife Federation and the Canadian Wildlife Service were unable to locate any copies for the series&#x27; 50th anniversary, despite extensive searches of various sources, including the NFB, Library and Archives Canada, the CBC archives, and even YouTube. These segments, filmed in black and white with versions in English and French, featured the beaver, the loon, the gannet and the moose.

Soon after the problem of the search was made public, one of the missing installments, an English-language version featuring the loon, was found in the CBC Vancouver archives a few days later, as part of a commercial break during a broadcast of the 1932 Laurel and Hardy classic comedy, &quot;Helpmates&quot; on July 1, 1969, a holiday then known as Dominion Day. According to Colin Preston, library coordinator at the CBC Vancouver Media Archives, the 1969 recordings were saved by a former CBC employee, who later donated them to the archives for posterity. The footage for the 1963 loon installment was originally filmed in colour, but converted to black and white for the installment. The colour film and soundtrack would be recycled in later versions of the series. Another of the missing four, the original beaver vignette, was subsequently found by Preston as well, as were the moose, and the gannet. The French-language versions of all four animals soon followed.

==Re-airings==

Starting in August 2016, the local Mountain View, California television show &quot;John Wants Answers&quot; started airing the original Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who vignettes in high definition. The show obtained digital high definition copies converted from the original film from the NFB.

==In popular culture==
These announcements became a widely recognized and often-parodied feature of Canadian pop culture.

*&quot;SCTV&quot; episode 142 featured a spoof of the &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot; &quot;Woodchuck&quot; episode, voiced by John Candy. The woodchuck also makes a brief appearance in episode 143.
* Also on &quot;SCTV&quot;, Bob and Doug McKenzie parodied the &quot;Hinterland&quot;&#x27;s distinctive flute theme by singing &quot;coo roo coo coo, coo coo coo coo&quot; at the start of each &quot;Great White North&quot; sketch.
* A spoof &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Wood Spider&quot; credited to &quot;First Church of Christ, Filmmaker&quot; was released on YouTube in 2006 and has garnered nearly 62 million views as of August 2024. The video purported to show the behavior of wood spiders given various drugs, such as alcohol, caffeine, and THC, a mocking reference to the 1940s research of Peter N. Witt, who showed that giving drugs to spiders alters their web building behavior.
* The &quot;Double Exposure&quot; comedy series on CBC Radio repeatedly sent up the series with a number of &#x27;Political Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&#x27; sequences in the late 1980s and 1990s. With no visuals, the narrator&#x27;s elaborate punning compared bureaucratic affairs to the struggle for survival in nature. &quot;On the depression north of Lake Ontario, the Great Blue Harris, or in Latin, &quot;Attila Foraqueensparkicus&quot;, has stirred up a hornets&#x27; nest with its fellow creatures living off a diet of bologna and tuna. The Great Blue Harris, not concerned with the welfare of others, has stirred the left wing back into full flight.&quot;
* The PSA &quot;House Hippo&quot; by Concerned Children&#x27;s Advertisers was a parody of the series. It features a voice over and footage of a small hippo. The narration was similar in style to &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot;.
* The game &quot;Dragon Age: Inquisition&quot;, produced by Canadian video game developer BioWare, features a sub-quest named &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot;.

<text>Gifted education (also known as gifted and talented education (GATE), talented and gifted programs (TAG), or G&amp;T education) is a sort of education used for children who have been identified as gifted or talented.

The main approaches to gifted education are enrichment and acceleration. An enrichment program teaches additional, deeper material, but keeps the student progressing through the curriculum at the same rate as other students. For example, after the gifted students have completed the normal work in the curriculum, an enrichment program might provide them with additional information about a subject. An acceleration program advances the student through the standard curriculum faster than normal. This is normally done by having the students skip one to two grades.

Being gifted and talented usually means being able to score in the top percentile on IQ exams. The percentage of students selected varies, generally with 10% or fewer being selected for gifted education programs. However, for a child to have distinct gifted abilities it is to be expected to score in the top one percent of students.

==Forms==
Attempts to provide gifted education can be classified in several ways. Most gifted students benefit from a combination of approaches at different times.

===Acceleration===

People are advanced to a higher-level class covering material more suited to their abilities and preparedness. This may take the form of skipping grades or completing the normal curriculum in a shorter-than-normal period of time (&quot;telescoping&quot;). Subject acceleration (also called partial acceleration) is a flexible approach that can advance a student in one subject, such as mathematics or language, without changing other studies, such as history or science. This type of acceleration is usually based upon achievement testing, rather than IQ.

Some colleges offer early entrance programs that give gifted younger students the opportunity to attend college early. In the U.S., many community colleges allow advanced students to enroll with the consent of school officials and the pupil&#x27;s parents.

Acceleration presents gifted children with academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, and for this reason is a low-cost option from the perspective of the school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. For the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially. Whole grade skipping is considered rapid acceleration. Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, psychologist Miraca Gross reports: &quot;the majority of these children [retained in a typical classroom] are socially rejected [by their peers with typical academic talents], isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of IQ 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress.&quot; These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible. Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.

===Cluster grouping===
Cluster grouping is the gathering of four to six gifted and talented and/or high achieving students in a single classroom for the entire school day. Cluster teachers are specially trained in differentiating for gifted learners. Clusters are typically used in upper elementary grades. Within a cluster group, instruction may include enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complexity in content.

===Colloquium===
Like acceleration, colloquium provides advanced material for high school students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement (AP) courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes in a different way than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.

===Compacting===
In compacting, the regular school material is compacted by pretesting the student to establish which skills and content have already been mastered. Pretests can be presented on a daily basis (pupils doing the most difficult items on a worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly), or before a week or longer unit of instructional time. When a student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material.

===Enrichment===
On the primary school level, students spend all class time with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may be as simple as a modified assignment provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as Odyssey of the Mind, Destination Imagination or academic competitions such as Brain Bowl, Future Problem Solving, Science Olympiad, National History Day, science fairs, or spelling bees. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses such as English, Spanish, Latin, philosophy, or science or to engage in extracurricular activities. Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives. However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.

===Full-time separate classes or schools===
Some gifted students are educated in either a separate class or a separate school. These classes and schools are sometimes called &quot;congregated gifted programs&quot; or &quot;dedicated gifted programs.&quot;

Some independent schools have a primary mission to serve the needs of the academically gifted. Such schools are relatively scarce and often difficult for families to locate. One resource for locating gifted schools in the United States can be found on the National Association for Gifted Children&#x27;s resource directory accessible through their home page. Such schools often need to work to guard their mission from occasional charges of elitism, support the professional growth and training of their staff, write curriculum units that are specifically designed to meet the social, emotional, and academic talents of their students, and educate their parent population at all ages.

Some gifted and talented classes offer self-directed or individualized studies, where the students lead a class themselves and decide on their own task, tests, and all other assignments. These separate classes or schools tend to be more expensive than regular classes, due to smaller class sizes and lower student-to-teacher rations. Not-for-profit (non-profit) schools often can offer lower costs than for-profit schools. Either way, they are in high demand and parents often have to pay part of the costs.

===Hobby===
Activities such as reading, creative writing, sport, computer games, chess, music, dance, foreign languages, and art give an extra intellectual challenge outside of school hours.

===Homeschooling===
An umbrella term encompassing a variety of educational activities conducted at home, including those for gifted children: part-time schooling; school at home; classes, groups, mentors and tutors; and unschooling. In many US states, the population of gifted students who are being homeschooled is rising quite rapidly, as school districts responding to budgetary issues and standards-based policies are cutting what limited gifted education programs remain in existence, and families seek educational opportunities that are tailored to each child&#x27;s unique needs.

=== Pull-out ===

Gifted students are pulled out of a heterogeneous classroom to spend a portion of their time in a gifted class. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum. The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced in gifted pull-out programs deals with the study of logic, and its application to fields ranging from philosophy to mathematics. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and outside of class.

===Self-pacing===
Self-pacing methods, such as the Montessori Method, use flexible grouping practices to allow children to advance at their own pace. Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at a highly accelerated rate. Directed Studies are usually based on self-pacing.

=== Summer enrichment ===
These offer a variety of courses that mainly take place in the summer. Summer schools are popular in the United States. Entrance fees are required for such programs, and programs typically focus on one subject, or class, for the duration of the camp.

Several examples of this type of program are:

*Center for Talented Youth
*CTYI
*Johns Hopkins University
*Center for Talent Development, Northwestern University

Within the United States, in addition to programs designed by the state, some counties also choose to form their own Talented and Gifted Programs. Sometimes this means that an individual county will form its own TAG program; sometimes several counties will come together if not enough gifted students are present in a single county. Generally, a TAG program focuses on a specific age group, particularly the local TAG programs. This could mean elementary age, high school age, or by years such as ages 9 through 14.

These classes are generally organized so that students have the opportunity to choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.

==Identifying gifted children==

The term &quot;Gifted Assessment&quot; is typically applied to a process of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist with the goal of identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/or through their classroom performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school teachers are not qualified to educate a gifted student. This can lead to a situation where a gifted child is bored, underachieves and misbehaves in class.

Individual IQ testing is usually the optimal method to identify giftedness among children. However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted. Therefore, examiners prefer using a variety of tests to first identify giftedness and then further differentiate. This is often done by using individual IQ tests and then group or individual achievement tests. There is no standard consensus on which tests to use, as each test is better suited for a certain role.

The two most popular tests for identifying giftedness in the school-age population are the WISC-IV and the SB5. The WIAT-III is considered the most popular academic achievement test to determine a child&#x27;s aggregate learned knowledge.

Although a newer WISC version, the WISC-V, was developed in late 2014, the WISC-IV is still the most commonplace test. It has been translated into several languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, German, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Italian. The WISC-IV assesses a child&#x27;s cognitive abilities, with respect to age group. Coupled with results from other tests, the WISC accurately depicts a child&#x27;s developmental and psychological needs for the future.

The SB5 is an intelligence test that determines cognitive abilities and can be administered to persons in virtually any age group. It assesses a series of intelligence indicators including fluid reasoning, general knowledge, quantitative reasoning, spatial processing, and working memory. The SB5 makes use of both verbal and nonverbal testing.

The WIAT-III cannot assess all components of learned knowledge, but does give an understanding of a child&#x27;s ability to acquire skills and knowledge through formal education. This test measures aspects of the learning process that take place in a traditional school setting in reading, writing, math, and oral language. Although the WIAT-III tests a wide range of material, it is designed primarily to assess children&#x27;s learning before adolescence.

Versions of these tests exist for each age group. However it is recommended to begin assessment as early as possible, with approximately eight years of age being the optimal time to test. Testing allows identification of specific needs of students and help to plan an education early.

Out-of-group achievement testing (such as taking the SAT or ACT early) can also help to identify these students early on (see SMPY) and is implemented by various talent search programs in use by education programs. Out-of-group testing can also help to differentiate children who have scored in the highest percentiles in a single IQ test.

Testing alone cannot accurately identify every gifted child. Teacher and parent nominations are essential additions to the objective information provided by grades and scores. Parents are encouraged to keep portfolios of their children&#x27;s work, and documentation of their early signs of gifted behavior.

==Studies of giftedness==
The development of early intelligence tests by Alfred Binet led to the Stanford-Binet IQ test developed by Lewis Terman. Terman began long-term studies of gifted children with a view to checking if the popular view &quot;early ripe, early rot&quot; was true. The Terman Genetic Studies of Genius longitudinal study has been described by successor researchers who conducted the study after Terman&#x27;s death and also by an independent researcher who had full access to the study files.

Modern studies by James and Kulik conclude that gifted students benefit &quot;least&quot; from working in a mixed-level class, and benefit &quot;most&quot; from learning with other similarly advanced students in accelerated or enriched classes.

===Definition of giftedness===
Educational authorities differ on the definition of giftedness: even when using the same IQ test to define giftedness, they may disagree on what gifted means—one may take up the top two percent of the population, another might take up the top five percent of a population, which may be within a state, district, or school. Within a single school district, there can be substantial differences in the distribution of measured IQ. The IQ for the top percentile at a high-performing school may be quite different from that at a lower performing school.

Peter Marshall obtained his doctorate in 1995, for research carried out in this field in the years from 1986. At the time, he was the first Research Director of the Mensa Foundation for Gifted Children. His work challenged the difficult childhood hypothesis, concluding that gifted children, by and large, do not have any more difficult childhoods than mainstream children and, in fact, that where they do, their giftedness probably helps them cope better than mainstream children and provided the material for his subsequent book Educating a Gifted Child.

In &quot;Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide&quot;, Susan K. Johnsen (2004) explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States federal definition of gifted and talented students:

The National Association for Gifted Children in the United States defines giftedness as:

This definition has been adopted in part or completely by the majority of the states in the United States. Most have some definition similar to that used in the State of Texas, whose definition states:

The major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creative, artistic, leadership, academic), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).

====Reliance on IQ====
In her book, &quot;Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide&quot;, Susan K. Johnsen (2004) writes that schools should use a variety of measures of students&#x27; capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.

Even if the notion of IQ is generally useful for identifying academically talented students who would benefit from further services, the question of the cutoff point for giftedness is still important. As noted above, different authorities often define giftedness differently.

==History==
===Classical era to Renaissance===
Gifted and talented education dates back thousands of years. Plato (c. 427–c. 347 BCE) advocated providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China&#x27;s Tang dynasty (580–618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who exhibited creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage.

===Francis Galton===

Francis Galton conducted one of the earliest Western studies of human intellectual abilities. Between 1888 and 1894, Galton tested more than 7,500 individuals to measure their natural intellectual abilities. He found that if a parent deviates from the norm, so will the child, but to a lesser extent than the parent. This was one of the earliest observed examples of regression toward the mean. Galton believed that individuals could be improved through interventions in heredity, a movement he named eugenics. He categorized individuals as gifted, capable, average, or degenerate, and he recommended breeding between the first two categories, and forced abstinence for the latter two. His term for the most intelligent and talented people was &quot;eminent&quot;. After studying England&#x27;s most prominent families, Galton concluded that one&#x27;s eminence was directly related to the individual&#x27;s direct line of heredity.

===Lewis Terman===
At Stanford University in 1918, Lewis Terman adapted Alfred Binet&#x27;s Binet-Simon intelligence test into the Stanford-Binet test, and introduced intelligence quotient (IQ) scoring for the test. According to Terman, the IQ was one&#x27;s mental age compared to one&#x27;s chronological age, based on the mental age norms he compiled after studying a sample of children. He defined intelligence as &quot;the ability to carry on abstract thinking&quot;. During World War I Terman was a commissioned officer of the United States Army, and collaborated with other psychologists in developing intelligence tests for new recruits to the armed forces. For the first time, intelligence testing was given to a wide population of drafted soldiers.

After the war, Terman undertook an extensive longitudinal study of 643 children in California who scored at IQ 140 or above, the Genetic Studies of Genius, continuing to evaluate them throughout their lives. Subjects of these case studies were called &quot;Termites&quot; and the studies contacted the children in 1921, and again in 1930, 1947, and 1959 after his death. Terman&#x27;s studies have to date been the most extensive on high-functioning children, and are still quoted in psychological literature today. Terman claimed to have disproven common misconceptions, such as that highly intelligent children were prone to ill physical and mental health, that their intelligence burned out early in their lives, or that they either achieved greatly or underachieved.

===Leta Hollingworth===
A professional colleague of Terman&#x27;s, Leta Hollingworth was the first in the United States to study how best to serve students who showed evidence of high performance on tests. Although recognizing Terman&#x27;s and Galton&#x27;s beliefs that heredity played a vital role in intelligence, Hollingworth gave similar credit to home environment and school structure. Hollingworth worked to dispel the pervasive belief that &quot;bright children take care of themselves&quot; and emphasized the importance of early identification, daily contact, and grouping gifted children with others with similar abilities. Hollingworth performed an 18-year-long study of 50 children in New York City who scored 155 or above on the Stanford-Binet, and studied smaller groups of children who scored above a 180. She also ran a school in New York City for bright students that employed a curriculum of student-led exploration, as opposed to a teacher providing students with a more advanced curriculum they would encounter later in life.

===Cold War===
One unforeseen result of the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was the immediate emphasis on education for bright students in the United States, and this settled the question whether the federal government should get involved in public education at all. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed by Congress in 1958 with $1 billion US to bolster science, math, and technology in public education. The National Defense Education Act would lead to other achievements such as forerunning the moon landing and the implementation of Advanced Placement, (A.P.), coursework. Educators immediately pushed to identify gifted students and serve them in schools. Students chosen for gifted services were given intelligence tests with a strict cutoff, usually at 130, which meant that students who scored below 130 were not identified.

===Marland Report===
The impact of the NDEA was evident in schools for years after, but a study on how effective education was meeting the needs of gifted students was initiated by the United States Department of Education in 1969. The Marland Report, completed in 1972, for the first time presented a general definition of giftedness, and urged districts to adopt it. The report also allowed students to show high functioning on talents and skills not measurable by an intelligence test. The Marland Report defined gifted as 
The report&#x27;s definition continues to be the basis of the definition of giftedness in most districts and states.

===A Nation at Risk===
In 1983, the result of an 18-month-long study of secondary students was published as &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;, and claimed that students in the United States were no longer receiving superior education, and in fact, could not compete with students from other developed countries in many academic exercises. One of the recommendations the book made was to increase services to gifted education programs, citing curriculum enrichment or acceleration specifically. The US federal government was also urged to create standards for the identification and servicing of gifted students.

===Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act===
The Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act was passed in 1988 as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Instead of funding district-level gifted education programs, the Javits Act instead has three primary components: the research of effective methods of testing, identification, and programming, which is performed at the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented; the awarding of grants to colleges, states, and districts that focus on underrepresented populations of gifted students; and grants awarded to state and districts for program implementation.

Annual funding for grants must be passed by US Congress, and totaled $9.6 million US in 2007, but the money is not promised. While he was president, George W. Bush eliminated the money every year of his term, but members of Congress overrode the president to make sure the grant money was distributed.

===No Child Left Behind===
The most recent US federal education initiative was signed into law in 2002. The goal of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is to bring the proficiency of all students to grade level but critics note it does not address the needs of gifted students who perform above grade level. The act imposes punishments on schools, administrators, and teachers when students do not achieve to the plan&#x27;s designs, but does not address any achievement standards for high-functioning students, forcing schools and teachers to spend their time with low-achieving students. An article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared, &quot;The unmistakable message to teachers – and to students – is that it makes no difference whether a child barely meets the proficiency standard or far exceeds it.&quot; Gifted services have been recently eroding as a result of the new legislation, according to a 2006 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===A Nation Deceived===
In 2004, the John Templeton Foundation sponsored a report titled &quot;A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America&#x27;s Brightest Students&quot;, highlighting the disparity between the research on acceleration (which generally supports it, both from an academic and a psychological point of view), and the educational practices in the US that are often contrary to the conclusions of that research. The Institute for Research and Policy on Acceleration (IRPA) was established in 2006 at The Connie Belin and Jacqueline N. Blank International Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development at the University of Iowa College of Education through the support of the John Templeton Foundation following the publication of this report.

==Global implementation==

===Australia===

Public gifted education in Australia varies significantly from state to state. New South Wales has 95 primary schools with opportunity classes catering to students in year 5 and 6. New South Wales also has 17 fully selective secondary schools and 25 partially selective secondary schools. Western Australia has selective programs in 17 high schools, including Perth Modern School, a fully selective school. Queensland has three Queensland Academies catering to students in years 10, 11 and 12. South Australia has programs in three public high schools catering to students in years 8, 9 and 10, including Glenunga International High School. The Victorian Government commissioned a parliamentary inquiry into the education of gifted and talented children in 2012. One recommendation from the inquiry was for the Victorian Government to list the schools with programs, but the government has not implemented this recommendation. Some private schools have developed programs for gifted children.

===Brazil===
The Centre for Talent and Potential Development (CEDET) is a special education center created by Zenita Guenther in Lavras, MG, Brazil, in 1993. CEDET is run by the Lavras School System with technical and civil responsibility delegated to the Association of Parents and Friends for Supporting Talent (ASPAT). Its main goal is to cultivate the proper physical and social environment for complementing and supplementing educational support to the gifted and talented student. At present, there are 512 gifted students age 7 to 17 enrolled at CEDET, around 5% of Lavras Basic School population. The students come from thirteen municipal schools, eight state schools and two private schools, plus a group of students from nearby communities brought in by their families.

===Canada===
In Alberta, the Calgary Board of Education (CBE) has various elementary, middle and high schools offering the GATE Program, standing for Gifted and Talented Education, for grades 4–12, or divisions 2–4. The program for students, who, through an IQ test, ranked in the Very Superior Range; falling into Gifted or Genius. For each of the three divisions, there are two schools offering GATE, one for the north side of the city (CBE areas I, II and III) and one for the south side (CBE areas IV and V). For Division 2, or grades 4–6, it is available at Hillhurst Elementary School for the North and Nellie McClung Elementary School for the South. For Division 3, or grades 7–9, it is available at Queen Elizabeth High School for the north and John Ware Junior High School for the south. For Division 3, or grades 10–12, Queen Elizabeth High School, a joint junior high–senior high, offers it for the north and Henry Wise Wood Senior High School offers it for the south. GATE classes go more in-depth and cover some curriculum for the following grade level, with tougher assignments and a faster learning pace. Students benefit from being around other students like them. These students attend the school alongside regular students and those in other programs (e.g. International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement.) In the 2014–2015 school year, students from grades 4–7 in the south will be attending Louis Riel Junior High School, already home to a science program, and students in the regular program there will be moved to Nellie McClung and John Ware. Students at John Ware will be phased out: eighth grade GATE will end in June 2015, and ninth grade GATE will end in 2016, while GATE will be expanding to grade 9 at Louis Riel by September 2016. Prior to John Ware, the GATE program was housed at Elboya. A large number of teachers from Nellie McClung and John Ware will be moving to the new location, which was picked to deal with student population issues and to concentrate resources. Notable alumni of the CBE GATE Program include the 36th mayor of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, from Queen Elizabeth High School.

Westmount Charter School in Calgary is a K–12 charter school specifically dedicated to gifted education.

In British Columbia, the Vancouver Board of Education&#x27;s gifted program is called Multi-Age Cluster Class or MACC. This is a full-time program for highly gifted elementary students from grades 4 to 7. Through project-based learning, students are challenged to use higher order thinking skills. Another focus of the program is autonomous learning; students are encouraged to self-monitor, self-reflect and seek out enrichment opportunities. Entrance to the program is initiated through referral followed by a review by a screening committee. IQ tests are used but not exclusively. Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are four MACCs in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French-immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.

At a lower scale, in Ontario, the Peel District School Board operates its Regional Enhanced Program at The Woodlands School, Lorne Park Secondary School, Glenforest Secondary School, Heart Lake Secondary School and Humberview Secondary School to provide students an opportunity to develop and explore skills in a particular area of interest. Students identified as gifted (which the PDSB classifies as &quot;enhanced&quot;) may choose to attend the nearest of these high schools instead of their assigned home high school. In the Regional Enhanced Program, enhanced students take core courses (primarily, but not limited to English, mathematics, and the sciences) in an environment surrounded by fellow enhanced peers. The classes often contain modified assignments that encourage students to be creative.

===Hong Kong===

==== Definition of giftedness ====
The Education Commission Report No. 4 issued in 1990 recommended a policy on gifted education for schools in Hong Kong and suggested that a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria should be adopted.

Gifted children generally have exceptional achievement or potential in one or more of the following domains:

#a high level of measured intelligence;
#specific academic aptitude in a subject area;
#creative thinking;
#superior talent in visual and performing arts;
#natural leadership of peers; and
#psychomotor ability – outstanding performance or ingenuity in athletics, mechanical skills or other areas requiring gross or fine motor coordination;

The multi-dimensional aspect of intelligence has been promoted by Professor Howard Gardner from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in his theory of multiple intelligences. In his introduction to the tenth anniversary edition of his classic work Frames of Mind, he says:

In the heyday of the psychometric and behaviorist eras, it was generally believed that intelligence was a single entity that was inherited; and that human beings – initially a blank slate – could be trained to learn anything, provided that it was presented in an appropriate way. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers believe precisely the opposite; that there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early &#x27;naive&#x27; theories of that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains. (Gardner 1993: xxiii)

Howard Gardner initially formulated a list of seven intelligences, but later added an eighth, that are intrinsic to the human mind: linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, bodily kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and naturalist intelligences.
It has become widely accepted at both local and international scales to adopt a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria to formulate gifted education policy.

==== Mission and principles ====
The mission of gifted education is to systematically and strategically explore and develop the potential of gifted students. Gifted learners are to be provided with opportunities to receive education at appropriate levels in a flexible teaching and learning environment. 
The guiding principles for gifted education in Hong Kong are:

*Nurturing multiple intelligences as a requirement of basic education for all students and an essential part of the mission for all schools
*The needs of gifted children are best met within their own schools though it is recognized that opportunities to learn with similarly gifted students are important. Schools have an obligation to provide stimulating and challenging learning opportunities for their students
*The identification of gifted students should recognize the breadth of multiple intelligences
*Schools should ensure that the social and emotional, as well as the intellectual, needs of gifted children are recognized and met.

==== Framework ====
Based on these guiding principles, a three-tier gifted education framework was adopted in 2000. Levels 1 &amp; 2 are recognised as being school-based whilst Level 3 is the responsibility of the HKAGE. The intention is that Level 1 serves the entire school population, irrespective of ability, that Level 2 deals with between 2–10% of the ability group, and that Level 3 caters for the top 2% of students.
*Level 1:
**A. To immerse the core elements advocated in gifted education i.e. High-order thinking skills, creativity and personal-social competence in the curriculum for ALL students;
**B. To differentiate teaching through appropriate grouping of students to meet the different needs of the groups with enrichment and extension of curriculum across ALL subjects in regular classrooms.
*Level 2:
**C. To conduct pull-out programmes of generic nature outside the regular classroom to allow systematic training for a homogeneous group of students (e.g. Creativity training, leadership training, etc.);
**D. To conduct pull-out programme in specific areas (e.g. Maths, Arts, etc.) outside the regular classroom to allow systematic training for students with outstanding performance in specific domains.
*Level 3:
**E. Tertiary institutions and other educational organizations / bodies, such as the Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education and other universities in Hong Kong to provide a wide and increasing range of programmes for gifted students

=== India ===
In India, Jnana Prabodhini Prashala started in 1968, is probably the first school for gifted education. The motto is &quot;motivating intelligence for social change.&quot; The school, located in central Pune, admits 80 students each year after thorough testing, which includes two written papers and an interview. The psychology department of Jnana Prabodhini has worked on J. P. Guilford&#x27;s model of intelligence.

===Iran===
National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET), also known as SAMPAD (), are national middle and high schools in Iran developed specifically for the development of exceptionally talented students in Iran. NODET was established in 1976 (as NIOGATE) and re-established in 1987.

Admission to NODET schools is selective and based on a comprehensive nationwide entrance examination procedure.

Every year thousands of students apply to enter the schools, from which less than 5% are chosen for the 99 middle schools and 98 high schools within the country. All applicants must have a minimum GPA of 19 (out of 20) for attending the entrance exam. In 2006, 87,081 boys and 83,596 girls from 56 cities applied, and 6,888 students were accepted for the 2007 middle school classes. The admission process is much more selective in big cities like Tehran, Isfahan, Mashhad and Karaj in which less than 150 students are accepted after two exams and interviews, out of over 50,000 applicants.

The top NODET (and Iranian) schools are Allameh Helli High School and Shahid Madani High School (in Tabriz), Farzanegan High School located in Tehran, Shahid Ejei High School located in Isfahan, Shahid Hashemi Nejad High School located in Mashhad and Shahid Soltani School located in Karaj. Courses taught in NODET schools are college-level in fields such as biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics and English. The best teachers from the ministry of education are chosen mainly by the school&#x27;s principal and faculty to teach at NODET schools. Schools mainly have only two majors (normal schools have three majors), math/physics and experimental sciences (like math/physics but with biology as the primary course). Even though social sciences are taught, there is much less emphasis on these subjects due to the lack of interest by both students and the organization.

===Norway===
Norway has no centre for gifted or talented children or youth. However, there is the privately run Barratt Due Institute of Music which offers musical kindergarten, evening school and college for highly talented young musicians. There is also the public secondary school for talents in ballet at Ruseløkka school in Oslo, which admits the top 15 dancers. In athletics, the privately run Norwegian Elite Sports Gymnasium (NTG) offers secondary school for talents in five locations in Norway. This account might not be complete.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland has run in Dublin City University since 1992.

===South Korea===
Following the Gifted Education Promotion Law () in the year 2000, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MEST) founded the National Research Center for Gifted and Talented Education (NRCGTE) in 2002 to ensure effective implementation of gifted education research, development, and policy. The center is managed by the Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI). Presently twenty-five universities conduct gifted and talented education research in some form; for example, Seoul National University is conducting Science-gifted Education Center, and KAIST is conducting Global Institute For Talented Education (GIFTED), the Korean Society for the Gifted and Talented () and the Korean Society for the Gifted ().

Education for the scientifically gifted in Korea can be traced back to the 1983 government founding of Gyeonggi Science High School. Following three later additions (Korea Science Academy of KAIST, Seoul Science High School and Daegu Science High School), approximately 1,500, or 1 in 1,300 (0.08 percent) of high school students are currently enrolled among its four gifted academies. By 2008, about 50,000, or 1 in 140 (0.7 percent) of elementary and middle school students participated in education for the gifted. In 2005, a program was undertaken to identify and educate gifted children of socioeconomically underprivileged people. Since then, more than 1,800 students have enrolled in the program.

Gradually, the focus has expanded over time to cover informatics, arts, physical education, creative writing, humanities, and social sciences, leading to the 2008 creation of the government-funded Korean National Institute for the Gifted Arts. To pluralize the need for trained professional educators, teachers undergo basic training (60 hours), advanced training (120 hours), and overseas training (60 hours) to acquire skills necessary to teach gifted youth.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) was introduced in 1984 and is offered in the upper primary years (Primary 4–6, ages 10–12). Pupils undergo rigorous testing in Primary 3 (age 9) for admission into the GEP for Primary 4 to 6. About 1% of the year&#x27;s cohort are admitted into the programme. The GEP is offered at selected schools, meaning that these pupils attend school alongside their peers in the mainstream curriculum but attend separate classes for certain subjects. As of the 2016 academic year, there are nine primary schools which offer the GEP.

===Slovakia===
The School for Gifted Children in Bratislava was established in 1998. It offers education known as APROGEN—Alternative Program for Gifted Education.

===Turkey===
The UYEP Research and Practice Center offers enriched programs for gifted students at Anadolu University. The center was founded by Ugur Sak in 2007. ANABILIM Schools have special classrooms for gifted and talented students. These schools apply the differentiated curriculum in the sciences, mathematics, language arts, social studies, and the arts for K8 gifted and talented students and enriched science and project-based learning in high school. There are over 200 science and art centers operated by the Ministry of Education that offer special education for gifted and talented students throughout the country. The Ministry uses the Anadolu Sak Intelligence Scale (ASIS) and the Wechsler Scales to select students for these centers. Four universities offer graduate programs in gifted education.

===United Kingdom===
In England, schools are expected to identify 5–10% of students who are gifted and/or talented in relation to the rest of the cohort in that school—an approach that is pragmatic (concerned with ensuring schools put in place some provision for their most able learners) rather than principled (in terms of how to best understand giftedness). The term gifted applies to traditional academic subjects, and talented is used in relation to high levels of attainment in the creative arts and sports. The National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth ran from 2002 to 2007 at the University of Warwick. Warwick University decided not to reapply for the contract to run NAGTY in 2007, instead introducing its own programme, the International Gateway for Gifted Youth in 2008. In January 2010, the government announced that NAGTY was to be scrapped the following month.

===United States===
In the United States, each state department of education determines if the needs of gifted students will be addressed as a mandatory function of public education. If so, the state determines the definition of which students will be identified and receive services, but may or may not determine how they shall receive services. If a state does not consider gifted education mandatory, individual districts may, thus the definition of what gifted is varies from state or district.

In contrast with special education, gifted education is not regulated on a federal level, although recommendations by the US Department of Education are offered. As such, funding for services is not consistent from state to state, and although students may be identified, the extent to which they receive services can vary widely depending upon a state or district&#x27;s budget.

Although schools with higher enrollment of minority or low-income students are just as likely to offer gifted programs as other schools, differing enrollment rates across racial and ethnic groups has raised concerns about equity in gifted education in the U.S.

Gifted education programs are also offered at various private schools. For example, the Mirman School caters to children with an IQ of 138 and above and Prep for Prep is focused on students of color.

== Commonly used terms ==
Source: National Association for Gifted Children—Frequently Used Terms in Gifted Education

Affective curriculum: A curriculum that is designed to teach gifted students about emotions, self-esteem, and social skills. This can be valuable for all students, especially those who have been grouped with much older students, or who have been rejected by their same-age, but academically typical, peers.

Differentiation: modification of a gifted student&#x27;s curriculum to accommodate their specific needs. This may include changing the content or ability level of the material.

Heterogeneous grouping: a strategy that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment in a single classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they were randomly assigned to classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery. Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed to provide a more effective instructional environment for less prepared students.

Homogeneous grouping: a strategy that groups students by specific ability, preparedness, or interest within a subject area. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be homogeneously grouped in math if they were assigned to classes based on demonstrated subject mastery rather than being randomly assigned. Homogeneous grouping can provide more effective instruction for the most prepared students.

Individualized Education Program (IEP): a written document that addresses a student&#x27;s specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created for students with disabilities, who are required by law to have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.

==Justification==
Researchers and practitioners in gifted education contend that, if education were to follow the medical maxim of &quot;first, do no harm,&quot; then no further justification would be required for providing resources for gifted education as they believe gifted children to be at-risk. The notion that gifted children are &quot;at-risk&quot; was publicly declared in the Marland Report in 1972:

Three decades later, a similar statement was made by researchers in the field: 

==Controversies==
Controversies concerning gifted education are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon the appropriateness of the term &quot;gifted&quot; or the definition of &quot;giftedness&quot;. For example, does &quot;giftedness&quot; refer to performance or potential (such as inherent intelligence)? Many students do not exhibit both at the same time.

Measures of general intelligence also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially over the past half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by &#x27;culture-neutral&#x27; tests (such as the Raven test), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many school districts in the United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented. However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.

Some schools and districts only accept IQ tests as evidence of giftedness. This brings scrutiny to the fact that many affluent families can afford to consult with an educational psychologist to test their children, whereas families with a limited income cannot afford the test and must depend on district resources.

===Class and ethnicity===
Gifted programs are often seen as being elitist in places where the majority of students receiving gifted services are from a privileged background. Identifying and serving gifted children from poverty presents unique challenges, ranging from emotional issues arising from a family&#x27;s economic insecurity, to gaps in pre-school cognitive development due to the family&#x27;s lack of education and time.

In New York City, experience has shown that basing admission to gifted and talented programs on tests of any sort can result in selection of substantially more middle-class and white or Asian students and development of more programs in schools that such students attend.

===Emotional aspects===
While giftedness is seen as an academic advantage, psychologically it can pose other challenges for the gifted individual. A person who is intellectually advanced may or may not be advanced in other areas. Each individual student needs to be evaluated for physical, social, and emotional skills without the traditional prejudices which prescribe either &quot;compensatory&quot; weaknesses or &quot;matching&quot; advancement in these areas.

It is a common misconception that gifted students are universally gifted in all areas of academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic success are often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. Gifted students come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.
A person with significant academic talents often finds it difficult to fit in with schoolmates. These pressures often wane during adulthood, but they can leave a significant negative impact on emotional development.

Social pressures can cause children to &quot;play down&quot; their intelligence in an effort to blend in with other students. &quot;Playing down&quot; is a strategy often used by students with clinical depression and is seen somewhat more frequently in socially acute adolescents. This behavior is usually discouraged by educators when they recognize it. Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often the same people who are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.

Students who are young, enthusiastic or aggressive are more likely to attract attention and to disrupt the class by working ahead, giving the correct answers all the time, asking for new assignments, or finding creative ways to entertain themselves while the rest of the class finishes an assignment. This behavior can be mistaken for ADHD. 

Many parents of gifted find that it is the social-emotional aspect of their children&#x27;s lives that needs support. Schools and talent development programs often focus on academic enrichment rather than providing time for gifted children to have the social interaction with true peers that is required for healthy development. National organizations such as Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted (SENG) as well as local organizations, have emerged in an effort to meet these needs.

It can also happen that some unidentified gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and lose track of where the class is in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.

Finally, gifted and talented students are statistically somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with a mental disorder such as bipolar disorder and to become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Gifted and talented students also have a higher chance of co-occurring learning disability. Gifted students with learning disabilities are often called twice exceptional. These students can require special attention in school.

===Gender===

Another area of controversy has been the marginalization of gifted females. Studies have attributed this to self-efficacy, acculturation and biological differences in aptitude between boys and girls for advanced mathematics.

===Test preparation===
In the United States, particularly in New York City where qualifying children as young as four are enrolled in enriched kindergarten classes offered by the public schools, a test preparation industry has grown up which closely monitors the nature of tests given to prospective students of gifted and talented programs. This can result in admission of significant numbers of students into programs who lack superior natural intellectual talent and exclusion of naturally talented students who did not participate in test preparation or lacked the resources to do so.

It is virtually impossible to train a child for a WISC test or other gifted test. Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information. It would also be disastrous if a non-gifted student was placed in a gifted program. Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.

Private gifted assessment is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents take advantage of online screening tests to give a preliminary indication of potential giftedness. Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological assessment is to do a curriculum-based assessment. Curriculum-based assessment is a form of achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child&#x27;s performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.

<doc id="422323" wikidata="Q272209" url="?curid=422323" title="Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians">
<text>Æthelred (died 911) became Lord of the Mercians in England shortly after the death or disappearance of Mercia&#x27;s last king, Ceolwulf II, in 879. He is also sometimes called the Ealdorman of Mercia. Æthelred&#x27;s rule was confined to the western half, as eastern Mercia was then part of the Viking-ruled Danelaw. His ancestry is unknown. He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881, and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. This alliance was cemented by the marriage of Æthelred to Alfred&#x27;s daughter Æthelflæd.

In 886, Alfred took possession of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations. Alfred then handed London over to Æthelred, as it had traditionally been a Mercian town. In 892, the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year, Æthelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred&#x27;s son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time after 899 Æthelred&#x27;s health may have declined, and Æthelflæd may have become the effective ruler of Mercia.

After Æthelred&#x27;s death, Æthelflæd ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918. The couple&#x27;s only child, a daughter called Ælfwynn, then ruled briefly until deposed by her uncle, King Edward.

==Background==

Mercia was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century, and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by King Ecgberht of Wessex at the Battle of Ellendun in 825. Ecgberht briefly conquered Mercia, but it recovered its independence in 830, and thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings. The Mercians traditionally held overlordship over Wales, and in 853, King Burgred of Mercia obtained the assistance of King Æthelwulf of Wessex in an invasion of Wales in order to reassert their hegemony. The same year, Burgred married Æthelwulf&#x27;s daughter.

In 865, the Viking Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia, and used it as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to buy peace, and the following year, the Vikings invaded Northumbria, where they established an obscure Northumbrian man called Ecgberht as puppet king in 867. They then moved on to Nottingham in Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867–868. Burgred was joined by King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother, the future King Alfred, for a combined attack on the Vikings, but they refused an engagement and in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Vikings conquered East Anglia. They returned to Mercia in 872; two years later they expelled Burgred, and Ceolwulf became king with their support. Ceolwulf was described by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as &quot;a foolish king&#x27;s thegn&quot; who was a puppet of the Vikings, but historians regard this view as partial and distorted: he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred.

In 877, the Vikings divided Mercia, taking the eastern part for themselves and leaving Ceolwulf with the west. The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost the same time as Alfred&#x27;s victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf&#x27;s disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex.

==Life==
===Early rule===
Æthelred&#x27;s descent is unknown, and he does not appear to have been closely related to his immediate predecessors, although his name suggests possible descent from earlier Mercian kings. He may have been the man of the same name who attested two Mercian charters in the late 860s, but he is not listed in the two surviving charters of Ceolwulf. Lists of witnesses to charters show that Æthelred&#x27;s witan (council) shared bishops and at least two ealdormen with Ceolwulf, but Ceolwulf&#x27;s thegns all disappeared. In the view of Ian Walker: &quot;He was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in the south-west of Mercia in the former kingdom of the Hwicce around Gloucester.&quot; However, Alex Woolf suggests that he was probably the son of King Burgred of Mercia and Æthelswith, sister of Alfred the Great, although that would mean that Æthelred&#x27;s marriage was uncanonical, as Rome then forbade marriage between first cousins.

It is not known when Æthelred took over following Ceolwulf&#x27;s death or disappearance, but in the view of Thomas Charles-Edwards, a historian of medieval Wales, Æthelred was almost certainly &quot;Edryd Long-Hair&quot;, the leader of a Mercian army which invaded Gwynedd in 881, and was defeated by Rhodri Mawr&#x27;s sons at the Battle of the Conwy. This was described by Welsh annals as &quot;revenge by God for Rhodri&quot;. The defeat forced Æthelred to abandon his ambitions in north Wales, but he continued to exercise overlordship over the south-eastern Welsh kingdoms of Glywysing and Gwent. According to Alfred&#x27;s Welsh biographer Asser, Æthelred&#x27;s &quot;might and tyrannical behaviour&quot; forced these kingdoms to submit to the protection of King Alfred&#x27;s lordship. By 883, Æthelred had accepted Alfred&#x27;s lordship. Charles-Edwards suggests that in 881–882 he tried to maintain his dominance in south-east Wales, but Alfred offered his protection to Glywysing and Gwent, and in 882–883, Æthelred accepted that West Saxon power made continued independence impossible. Charles-Edwards comments:
:The implication of all this is that the Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial step in the creation of a single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred&#x27;s victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, &quot;God&#x27;s revenge&quot; on the Mercians at the Conwy, when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit.

When Æthelred made a grant to Berkeley Abbey in 883, he did it with the approval of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred&#x27;s lordship. Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred&#x27;s permission, but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred, such as at a meeting in Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.

After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred established a network of fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred&#x27;s lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town&#x27;s defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.

London suffered severely from Viking attacks and was several times occupied by Viking armies. In 886, Alfred took possession of London, and according to Asser he &quot;restored&quot; the city and &quot;made it habitable again&quot;. He then handed control to Æthelred. Historians, however, disagree about the circumstances. According to Frank Stenton, Alfred recovered London by force from the Vikings and handed it to Æthelred because it had previously been a Mercian town, and he respected the traditions of other kingdoms. Marios Costambeys takes a similar view, arguing that Alfred&#x27;s decision was probably due to the need to maintain unity among the English who were outside Viking territory. Alfred Smyth suggests that the &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; account reflects bias in Alfred&#x27;s favour, and that Æthelred took charge because he had a greater role in London&#x27;s recovery than the West Saxon chronicler was willing to admit. Some versions of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; state that Alfred besieged London in 883, and Simon Keynes argues that Alfred probably took London at that time and that the &quot;occupation&quot; in 886 may have been a restoration of London&#x27;s defences following Viking attacks close to the city in 885.

Anglo-Saxon London, called Lundenwic, was located a mile west of Roman Londinium, but Lundenwic was undefended, and the restoration was carried out inside the walls of the old Roman city, especially an area close to the River Thames now called Queenhithe, but which was then known as &quot;Æthelred&#x27;s Hythe&quot; after its Mercian ruler. Æthelred moved quickly to restore the area; in 889, he and Alfred granted property there to the Bishop of Worcester, and in 899, they made another grant to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both bishops were, like Æthelred, Mercians and strong allies of King Alfred, who had the right to all tolls from markets along the river bank.

After the restoration of London, Alfred received the submission of &quot;all the English people who were not under subjection to the Danes&quot;, and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was cemented by the marriage of Æthelred to Alfred&#x27;s oldest daughter, Æthelflæd. She is first recorded as Æthelred&#x27;s wife in a charter of 887, but the marriage probably took place in the early to mid 880s. Æthelred was probably much older than his wife. They had a daughter, Ælfwynn, and according to the twelfth century chronicler, William of Malmesbury, she was their only child. In King Alfred&#x27;s will, drawn up in the 880s, Æthelred was left a sword worth 100 mancuses.

In 892, two Viking armies attacked eastern England, and Æthelred took part in the defence. After the defeat of one Viking leader, Hastein, Alfred became godfather to one of Hastein&#x27;s two sons and Æthelred to the other. Soon afterwards, the English captured Hastein&#x27;s wife and children, but they were returned to him because the sons were godsons of the English leaders. In 893, Æthelred brought troops from London to join Alfred&#x27;s son Edward against a Viking army at Thorney in Buckinghamshire, but the Vikings were too strong for a direct attack so they were allowed to leave English territory. Later in the year, a larger Viking force marched from Essex through Mercia to the Welsh border, followed by Æthelred with a joint force of Mercians and West Saxons. Welsh kings joined Æthelred to meet the Vikings at the Battle of Buttington, where according to Smyth &quot;these invaders were utterly routed ... in what was the most decisive battle in the war&quot;, although Marios Costambeys states that the Vikings eventually cut their way out and retreated back to Essex. The Viking army finally dispersed in 896. For much of the time, Alfred had been in the west country defending Devonshire, and in the view of Richard Abels: &quot;King Alfred had little to do directly with the great victories enjoyed by the English in 893–896. His son, Edward, and his ealdormen, in particular his son-in-law, Æthelred, had won the glory.&quot;

In the last years of the ninth century, three ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred. Æthelflæd&#x27;s maternal uncle, Æthelwulf, controlled western and possibly central Mercia, while the south and east were ruled by Æthelfrith, the father of Æthelstan Half-King. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded after the turn of the century, and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd&#x27;s chief lieutenant when Æthelred&#x27;s health collapsed soon afterwards. Æthelfrith may have been of West Saxon origin, appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.

Evidence from charters shows that Æthelred and Æthelflæd supported religious communities. In 883, Æthelred freed Berkeley Abbey from obligations to the king&#x27;s &quot;feorm&quot; (payments in kind), and in 887 he confirmed (with Æthelflæd also attesting) the possession of land and transferred manpower to Pyrton Minster in Oxfordshire. In 901, they jointly gave land to Much Wenlock Abbey, and donated a gold chalice weighing thirty mancuses in honour of its former abbess, Saint Mildburgh. In 903, they negotiated a settlement over a former monastic estate which the bishops of Worcester had been trying to recover since the 840s, and Bishop Wærferth wrote &quot;we never could get anywhere until Æthelred became Lord of the Mercians&quot;.

===Later life===
Some historians believe that at an unknown time in the decade 899 to 909, Æthelred&#x27;s health collapsed and Æthelflæd became the effective ruler of Mercia. Cyril Hart and Maggie Bailey believe that it occurred by 902. Bailey cites &quot;Mercian Register&quot; entries from 902 showing Æthelflæd acting alone or in conjunction with Edward in military operations. Irish annals called the &quot;Three Fragments&quot; also suggest that Æthelred was unable to take an active part in government from about 902, although he did attend a meeting in 903 with King Edward, Æthelflæd and Ælfwynn. In 1998, Keynes suggested that Æthelred may have been incapacitated by illness at the end of his life, but in a summary of his career in 2014, Keynes does not mention this, stating that Æthelred and Æthelflæd cooperated with King Edward in campaigns against the Vikings. Martin Ryan also makes no mention of a decline in Æthelred&#x27;s health, describing him as joining Edward in encouraging thegns to purchase land in Viking territories.

According to William of Malmesbury, King Edward&#x27;s eldest son, the future King Æthelstan, was sent to be brought up at the court of Æthelred and Æthelflæd after Edward remarried in about 900. This is supported by one independent piece of evidence. According to a transcript dating from 1304 in York&#x27;s archives, in 925, Æthelstan gave a grant of privileges to St Oswald&#x27;s Priory in Gloucester &quot;according to a pact of paternal piety which formerly he pledged with Æthelred, ealdorman of the people of the Mercians&quot;. When King Edward died in 924, Æthelstan initially faced opposition at the West Saxon court, but was accepted as king in Mercia.

After Æthelred&#x27;s death in 911, Æthelflæd ruled as &quot;Lady of the Mercians&quot;, but she did not inherit the Mercian territories of London and Oxford, which were taken by Edward. Æthelflæd died in 918, and their daughter Ælfwynn briefly ruled Mercia until deposed by Edward the Elder, who took the territory under his direct control.

===St Oswald&#x27;s Priory, Gloucester===
Gloucester seems to have been the main seat of Æthelred&#x27;s and Æthelflæd&#x27;s power, and before 900 they founded a new minster there, dedicated to St Peter. In 909, a West Saxon and Mercian army raided Viking territory and seized the bones of the Northumbrian king and martyr, St Oswald, from Bardney in Lincolnshire. The bones were translated to the new Gloucester minster, which was renamed St Oswald&#x27;s Priory in his honour. The acquisition of the relics raised the prestige of the new minster and increased its wealth by making it a focus for pilgrims. The historian Martin Ryan sees the new minster as something like a Mercian royal mausoleum, to replace the one at Repton destroyed by the Vikings, and Æthelred and Æthelflæd were buried there.

==Status==
Æthelred&#x27;s status is disputed, and this is reflected in the varying titles given to him by different historians. He is sometimes called &quot;ealdorman&quot;, but also &quot;Lord of the Mercians&quot; and &quot;subking&quot;. Coinage issued in English Mercia in Ceolred&#x27;s time named him as king, but in Æthelred&#x27;s time it named the West Saxon king, yet Æthelred issued some charters in his own name, implying royal authority. West Saxon sources refer to him as an ealdorman, emphasising Mercian subordination to the West Saxon monarchy, whereas Mercian ones describe him as Lord of the Mercians, and Celtic ones sometimes as King of Mercia. The late tenth-century chronicler Æthelweard, in his annal for 893, called Æthelred &quot;King of the Mercians&quot;, but recorded his death in 911 as that of the &quot;Lord of the Mercians&quot;.

King Edward&#x27;s influence over Mercia is unclear, and he may have had less power than his father. Edward&#x27;s charters show Æthelred and Æthelflæd as accepting his royal authority, but their own charters make no reference to an overlord, and some use expressions such as &quot;holding, governing and defending the sole rule of the Mercians&quot;, which come close to describing them as king and queen.

Pauline Stafford comments that &quot;Alfred&#x27;s dominance in the 890s over Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, was as debatable at the time as it still is.&quot; In the view of Ann Williams, &quot;though he accepted West Saxon overlordship, Æthelred behaved rather as a king of Mercia than an ealdorman&quot;, and Charles Insley states that Mercia remained an independent kingdom until 920. To the Welsh and Irish looking east, Mercian rulers still kept all their old regality until Æthelflæd&#x27;s death in 918, and Nick Higham argues that: &quot;Celtic visions of Æthelred and Æthelflæd as king and queen certainly offer a different, and equally valid, contemporary take on the complex politics of this transition to a new English state.&quot;

In the &quot;Handbook of British Chronology&quot; David Dumville lists Æthelred as King Æthelred II, and thus a successor to the seventh century King Æthelred of Mercia. Keynes takes the West Saxon view, arguing that Alfred created the &quot;kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons&quot;, inherited by his son Edward the Elder in 899, and Æthelred ruled Mercia under the king. However, Keynes also says:
:Æthelred usually acted with the permission of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain &quot;dux&quot; or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other &quot;duces&quot;, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.

<text>is a Japanese racing driver, who competes part-time in the IndyCar Series for RLL. Sato competed in Formula One from to . In American open-wheel racing, Sato is a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 2017 and 2020, remaining the only Asian driver to win the event.

Born and raised in Tokyo, Sato began his career in karting before moving to Europe in 1999 with support from Honda. Progressing directly to Formula Three, Sato finished third in the British Championship in 2000 before dominating the series in 2001 with Carlin. During the latter, he also won the Macau Grand Prix and the Masters of Formula 3. Sato signed for Jordan in , making his Formula One debut at the , under Honda power. He moved with Honda to join BAR in as a reserve driver, replacing Jacques Villeneuve at his home Grand Prix in Japan and returning as a full-time driver in . Sato achieved his only podium finish at the as he finished a career-best eighth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Following struggles at BAR in , Sato moved to Super Aguri for his campaign onwards. Amidst financial troubles, Super Aguri withdrew from the sport after the 2008 Spanish Grand Prix, ending both Sato and teammate Anthony Davidson&#x27;s driving careers in Formula One.

After a year hiatus, Sato returned to open-wheel racing in the IndyCar Series with KV in 2010. He took his maiden pole position at the Iowa Corn Indy 250 in 2011, and became the first Asian driver to win an IndyCar race at the Grand Prix of Long Beach in 2013 with Foyt. His one-off entry in Formula E at the 2014 Beijing ePrix marked the first—and to this date, only—time that Sato competed without a Honda power unit in his professional career, using a spec McLaren powertrain. Sato signed for Andretti in 2017, winning the Indianapolis 500 for the first time. He took several further wins across his 2018 and 2019 seasons with RLL, before again winning at Indianapolis in 2020. Sato competed for DCR in 2022, before moving into part-time roles from 2023 onwards.

Sato is a widely popular figure amongst fans and media worldwide, renowned for his aggressive driving style and motto &quot;No Attack, No Chance&quot;.

==Early career==
Born in Tokyo, Sato began karting in Japan at the age of 19. After winning the national karting title in 1997, he moved to Europe with backing from Honda. He briefly raced in Vauxhall Junior and Formula Opel, before debuting in Class B of the British Formula 3 Championship mid-way through 1999 British Formula Three Championship with class wins at the British Grand Prix and Spa for Diamond Racing. He moved to the top class of the championship with Carlin Motorsport in 2000, taking four wins and third place in the championship. In 2001, he won 12 out of 26 races to take a dominant championship win, the first for a Japanese driver in the series. In 2001 he also won the prestigious Macau Grand Prix and Masters of Formula 3 non-championship F3 races.

==Formula One career==

===Jordan (2002)===
In Sato graduated to Formula One with the Honda-powered Jordan team, and was paired with Giancarlo Fisichella. His low point was a tremendous crash in Austria, caused when Nick Heidfeld lost control of his Sauber under braking and hit the side of Sato&#x27;s car, punching a hole in the side of the cockpit. Throughout he showed flashes of speed but also wild driving, nevertheless the team&#x27;s faith in Sato was repaid by a fine drive to fifth at his home Grand Prix in Suzuka.

===BAR (2003–2005)===

With Honda&#x27;s focus shifting solely to British American Racing for , Sato joined the Brackley-based outfit as a test driver. For the final round in Japan, Sato replaced Jacques Villeneuve and scored the second points finish of his career with sixth place, after a battle with Michael Schumacher. He was signed to race full-time in 2004. During the 2004 season, Sato qualified four times in the top-three, including a front row start and an overall lap record at the European Grand Prix. Sato&#x27;s aggressive driving style paid dividends at the , where, after the team did not pit under safety car conditions, Sato fought back with some daring overtaking moves to score his first podium finish and the first for a Japanese driver since Aguri Suzuki at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix. Reliability issues caused him to retire six times, but he scored points in nine of the 11 races he completed to finish eighth in the championship with 34 points, the best-ever result for a Japanese driver in Formula One. His efforts helped BAR-Honda to finish second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Sato was retained by BAR-Honda for the 2005 season, but the 2005 car was not as close to the front of the pack as the previous year&#x27;s design. Sato missed the with illness, and both drivers were disqualified from the and the entire team banned from the two subsequent races for using cars that were underweight when all fuel was removed. The Court did not find that this was deliberate. Sato&#x27;s season never recovered from that point, and he ended the season with eighth-place at the Hungarian Grand Prix as his only points finish, despite qualifying seven times in the top ten. Sato was not re-signed for 2006, despite Honda taking full control of the team.

===Super Aguri (2006–2008)===
Sato joined the new Super Aguri F1 team for , run by Japanese former driver Aguri Suzuki. The new outfit was in effect a Honda B-team but ran the first half of the season with a modified version of a 2002 Arrows A23 chassis. Nevertheless, Sato&#x27;s reputation improved thanks to his professional attitude and competitive spirit. The team introduced a new car, the SA06 at the and by the end of the season, Sato was outpacing the Midland cars. At the season finale in Brazil Sato finished tenth just two places short of a points finish and comfortably ahead of both Toro Rossos and the Spyker MF1s.
For 2007, Super Aguri ran a reworked version of the previous year&#x27;s Honda RA106 chassis. Their performance improved drastically as Sato made it through to Q3 at the . He then scored the first point for the team at the . At the , Sato finished sixth after having a race that had seen him move from the middle of the grid to a high of fifth, passing Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen before a pit-stop error dropped him back to eleventh. He moved up five places in the last 15 laps, passing Toyota&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher and then on lap 67 the McLaren-Mercedes of Fernando Alonso; the latter pass was met with cheers around the track and received him the &quot;Overtake of the Year&quot; award from &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine.

Financial problems began to affect the team in the off-season and the squad only just made it to the opening round of the season in Australia. The team used a modified Honda RA107 chassis, which was launched just before the first Friday Practice session that weekend. A transmission issue in Australia ended an opportunity to score points in a race of attrition, and 13th in Spain turned out to be Sato&#x27;s best result of the season. Due to the financial struggles, Super Aguri withdrew from Formula One after the Spanish Grand Prix, leaving Sato without a drive after four races in 2008.

In late 2008, Sato took part in tests at Jerez with Scuderia Toro Rosso, to become a candidate to fill the seat vacated by Sebastian Vettel. He was competing against former Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais and Red Bull Racing test and reserve driver Sébastien Buemi for one of the two race seats. He first drove on 18 September, more than four months since Super Aguri&#x27;s withdrawal, and tested for the team again for two days in November, setting the fastest time on the 17th, 3 tenths ahead of Buemi, and proceeded by setting the second-fastest time on the 18th. The race seat was eventually given to Bourdais, and in March 2009 it was announced that Sato would not be the reserve driver for the Red Bull team.

==IndyCar career==
===KV Racing Technology (2010–2011)===

Sato visited the Indianapolis 500 in May 2009. He signed with KV Racing Technology to drive in the 2010 IndyCar Series season finishing in 21st place. He signed for the same team for 2011 and improved his form, scoring three top-five finishes and two pole positions during the season to finish 13th.

===Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (2012)===
At the 2012 Indianapolis 500, driving for Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, Sato chased Dario Franchitti to the finish making a move for the lead and the race win at the first turn of the last lap. While not successful, Sato was respected by Indianapolis 500 fans for &quot;going for it&quot; on the last lap.

===A. J. Foyt Enterprises (2013–2016)===

For 2013, Sato joined A. J. Foyt&#x27;s team, driving the No. 14 car vacated by Mike Conway. In the third race of the season at Long Beach, Sato scored his first IndyCar win, in his 52nd start in the series, making him the first Japanese driver to win an IndyCar race. He then scored six top-five finishes, including two podiums and two pole positions, until he left the team at the end of 2016.

===Andretti Autosport (2017)===

Sato joined Andretti Autosport for the 2017 season. He went on to become the first Asian driver to win the Indianapolis 500. After the 500 win, he went on to win a pole at the Dual in Detroit on Belle Isle. He also ended up winning another pole at Pocono Raceway in August.

===Return to Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (2018–2021)===
On 26 August 2017, it was reported that in 2018, Sato would rejoin RLL to drive the 30 car with Graham Rahal as his teammate as Andretti Autosport considered a move to Chevrolet in 2018. That move by Andretti subsequently did not happen. After numerous weeks of bad luck including crashing early in the Indianapolis 500 and wrecking early at Pocono and a failed pit strategy at Gateway, Sato played the strategy right and held off Ryan Hunter-Reay in the IndyCar return to Portland, winning his third career race and his first on a permanent road course, doing so from 20th starting position. Sato started his 2019 season with a win in the third race at Barber Motorsports Park; he started the race from pole position and ran away to the finish. Sato won later in the season at World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway.

On 23 August 2020, after qualifying on the outside of the front row for the 104th running of the Indianapolis 500, Sato won the race for a second time.

On 5 October 2021, it was announced that Sato would not return to the team for the 2022 IndyCar season. His spot in the team was taken over by Danish driver, Christian Lundgaard.

===Dale Coyne Racing (2022)===
On 9 December 2021, it was announced that Sato had signed with Dale Coyne Racing with Rick Ware Racing for the 2022 season, replacing Romain Grosjean, who had signed with Andretti Autosport. He finished 25th at the Indianapolis 500.

=== Chip Ganassi Racing (2023) ===
Chip Ganassi Racing signed Sato to run in the oval rounds for the 2023 season, making it the first time the Japanese driver does not have a full-time IndyCar seat since 2010.

=== Second return to Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (2024) ===
On March 18th, 2024, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (RLL) announced that Sato would attempt to win his third Indianapolis 500 victory in the 108th running of the race on May 26. It was Sato&#x27;s only scheduled IndyCar race for the 2024 season. He finished fourteenth.

==Other categories==
===Formula Nippon / Super Formula===
On 14 June 2012, Team Mugen announced that Sato would race with the team in the last three rounds of the 2012 Formula Nippon season. He also raced with Team Mugen in the opening round of the renamed 2013 Super Formula season, and later in the year returned to the team to compete in the last three races of the season; he scored his first points with an eighth-place finish in the season finale.

===Formula E===
In November 2013, Sato became a test and development driver for the FIA Formula E Championship. In September 2014, Sato joined his former Formula One team Amlin Aguri to race in the first-ever Formula E race, the 2014 Beijing ePrix, replacing the team&#x27;s regular driver Antonio Félix da Costa as he could not participate due to other commitments. Sato scored two points after he set the fastest lap of the race with a time of 1:45.101, but had to retire from the race with mechanical issues. As it was Sato&#x27;s only Formula E race, he became the only driver in the series&#x27; history with a 100% fastest lap record.

==Reception==
Sato is a widely popular figure amongst fans and media, renowned for his aggressive driving style and motto &quot;No Attack, No Chance&quot;.

==Honors==
In 2024, Sato became the first Japanese-born driver to be inducted into the Long Beach Motorsports Walk of Fame.

<text>A napkin, serviette or face towelette is a square of cloth or paper tissue used at the table for wiping the mouth and fingers while eating. It is also sometimes used as a bib by tucking it into a shirt collar. It is usually small and folded, sometimes in intricate designs and shapes.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The term &#x27;napkin&#x27; dates from the 14th century, in the sense of a piece of cloth or paper used at mealtimes to wipe the lips or fingers and to protect clothing. The word derives from the Late Middle English &quot;nappekin&quot;, from Old French &quot;nappe&quot; (tablecloth, from Latin &quot;&quot;), with the suffix &quot;-kin&quot;.

A &#x27;napkin&#x27; can also refer to a small cloth or towel, such as a handkerchief in dialectal British, or a kerchief in Scotland.

&#x27;Napkin&#x27; may also be short for &quot;sanitary napkin&quot;.

== Description ==

Conventionally, the napkin is folded and placed to the left of the place setting, outside the outermost fork. In a restaurant setting or a caterer&#x27;s hall, it may be folded into more elaborate shapes and displayed on the empty plate. Origami techniques can be used to create a three-dimensional design. A napkin may also be held together in a bundle with cutlery by a napkin ring. Alternatively, paper napkins may be contained within a napkin holder.

== History ==
Summaries of napkin history often say that the ancient Greeks used bread to wipe their hands. This is suggested by a passage in one of Alciphron&#x27;s letters (3:44), and some remarks by the sausage seller in Aristophanes&#x27; play, &quot;The Knights&quot;. The bread in both texts is referred to as &quot;apomagdalia&quot; which simply means bread from inside the crust known as &quot;the crumb&quot; and not special &quot;napkin bread&quot;. Napkins were also used in ancient Roman times.

One of the earliest references to table napkins in English dates to 1384–85.

=== Paper napkins ===
The use of paper napkins is documented in ancient China, where paper was invented in the 2nd century BC. Paper napkins were known as &quot;chih pha&quot;, folded in squares, and used for the serving of tea. Textual evidence of paper napkins appears in a description of the possessions of the Yu family, from the city of Hangzhou.

Paper napkins were first imported to the US in the late 1800s but did not gain widespread acceptance until 1948, when Emily Post asserted, &quot;It’s far better form to use paper napkins than linen napkins that were used at breakfast.&quot;

=== Leonardo Da Vinci===
It has been claimed that Leonardo da Vinci invented the napkin in 1491. According to this claim, the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, used to tie up live rabbits decorated with ribbons to the guest’s chairs so they could wipe their hands on the animal’s back. Leonardo found this inappropriate, and presented a cloth for each guest. The myth stems from &quot;Leonardo&#x27;s Kitchen Notebooks&quot; (1987), by Jonathan Routh and Shelagh Routh, a prank book published as an April Fools’ Day joke, that claims a long lost Codex Romanoff was found in 1481, which never really existed.

<doc id="422345" wikidata="Q7399" url="?curid=422345" title="Emperor Fei of Jin">
<text>Emperor Fei of Jin (; 342 – November 23, 386), personal name Sima Yi (), courtesy name Yanling (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty in China. He was the younger brother (from the same mother) of Emperor Ai and later deposed by military leader Huan Wen. The title that he is normally referred to, &quot;Emperor Fei&quot;, is not a posthumous name as is usually the case with imperial common titles, but rather signified that he was deposed (with &quot;Fei&quot; () meaning &quot;depose&quot;). He is also commonly known by the title he was given after his removal, Duke of Haixi ().

== Early life ==
Sima Yi was born in 342, to Emperor Cheng and his concubine Consort Zhou, who was also the mother of his only brother, Sima Pi, who was one year older than he was. Later in 342, Emperor Cheng grew gravely ill. Typically, the throne would be passed down to a son, but Emperor Cheng&#x27;s uncle Yu Bing (), who wanted to control the government a little longer, suggested that since Jin was then facing the threat of Later Zhao, an older emperor was needed, and so persuaded Emperor Cheng to pass the throne to his younger brother Sima Yue the Prince of Langya, who was Yu Bing&#x27;s nephew as well. Emperor Cheng agreed, and after his death, Sima Yue took the throne as Emperor Kang. Emperor Kang created Sima Yi the Prince of Donghai on 1 August 342.

In Sima Yi&#x27;s youth, he went through a progression of official ranks. While he was still the Prince of Donghai, he married Yu Bing&#x27;s daughter Yu Daolian as his princess consort. In 361, after the death of his cousin Emperor Mu (Emperor Kang&#x27;s son) on 10 July, his older brother Sima Pi took the throne as Emperor Ai on 13 July, and he took over the greater title of Prince of Langya which Emperor Ai had previously held, on 15 July. In 365, after Emperor Ai died without a son, Sima Yi took the throne by decree of his aunt Empress Dowager Chu (Emperor Kang&#x27;s wife). He created his wife Princess Consort Yu empress.

== Reign ==
Even though Emperor Fei was an adult, he did not have actual power, as not only were governmental matters largely in the hands of his granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, but Sima Yu himself was not fully able to make decisions, as the paramount general Huan Wen imposed many of his own decisions on the imperial government, which had no choice but to accept.

Immediately after Emperor Fei took the throne, the important city Luoyang (which had served as Jin&#x27;s capital early in the dynasty&#x27;s history) fell to Former Yan, because Emperor Ai&#x27;s death prevented a relief force from being dispatched.

Late in 365, the general Sima Xun, the governor of Liang Province (梁州, modern southern Shaanxi) rebelled, but he was defeated, captured, and executed in summer 366.

On 5 July 366, Empress Yu died. Emperor Fei would not have another empress for the rest of his reign.

In 369, Huan launched a major attack against Former Yan, advancing all the way to the vicinity of Former Yan&#x27;s capital Yecheng, but hesitated at making a final assault on Yecheng, and was subsequently defeated by the Former Yan prince Murong Chui and Former Qin relief forces.

Huan, who had ambitions of usurpation and had intended to show off his power through conquering Former Yan until the campaign&#x27;s failure, decided that he would show off his power in another way. He plotted with his confidant Xi Chao () to intimidate everyone by deposing Emperor Fei. However, the emperor had been careful during his reign and had not had any major faults, so Huan figured he had to manufacture one. He spread rumors that Emperor Fei was impotent and unable to bear children—and that his sons, by his concubines Consort Tian and Consort Meng, had in fact been biological sons of men that he favored, Xiang Long (), Ji Hao (), and Zhu Lingbao (). (The rumors also implied a homosexual relationship between Emperor Fei and Xiang, Ji, and Zhu.) In December 371, Huan then went to the Jiankang and intimidated Empress Dowager Chu, to issue an edict that he had drafted deposing Emperor Fei. He replaced Emperor Fei with his granduncle Sima Yu, who took the throne as Emperor Jianwen. Emperor Fei was reduced in rank to Prince of Donghai, the title he had held for most of his life. Huan put Consorts Tian and Meng to death, along with their sons. He also massacred the powerful Yin and Yu clans.

== After removal ==
Huan Wen, however, wanted to further reduce the former emperor&#x27;s rank, and he proposed that the prince be reduced to commoner status. Empress Dowager Chu resisted, and only reduced his rank to Duke of Haixi. Huan, apprehensive that the former emperor may try to return to the throne, had him exiled to Wu (吳縣, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and put under heavy guard.

In winter 372, the Taoist agrarian rebel Lu Song () claimed to have an edict from Empress Dowager Chu to restore Emperor Fei, and he sent a messenger to the duke to persuade him to join the rebellion. Initially the duke believed him, but later realized that if the empress dowager wanted to restore him, she would send imperial guards to escort him, and therefore realized that there was no edict. Without the duke&#x27;s support, Lu&#x27;s rebellion collapsed.

In exile, the former emperor constantly feared death, so he spent his time indulging drinking, music, and women, to show to Huan that he had no desire for political actions. Whenever his concubines bore children, he would not dare to nurture them, but instead strangled them (so that he would not prove Huan wrong). As this became evident, Huan began to relax the restrictions against him. He died in 386 and was buried in Wu. His wife, Empress Yu, was disinterred to be reburied with him.

<text>The Hikitsuke (引付 lit. enquiry) or Hikitsuke-kata (引付方) (High Court) was one of the judicial organs of the Kamakura and Muromachi shogunates of Japan.

The Hikitsuke was established by the fifth &quot;shikken&quot; Hōjō Tokiyori in 1249 to expedite an increasing number of lawsuits in the higher Hyojosho court. The Hikitsuke was responsible for establishing the facts of a case, while the Hyojosho would interpret the applications of law.

The Hikitsuke had three, and later five, tribunals; each tribunal was operated by four or five Hikitsukeshū (引付衆 adjusters), whose head was called a Tōnin (頭人), with four or five Bugyōnin (奉行人 secretaries).

The Hikitsuke&#x27;s power increased gradually. At first the Hikitsuke just drafted several verdicts after hearings and submitted them to the Hyojoshu. Submitting only one verdict per lawsuit, the Hikitsuke later became a &quot;de facto&quot; full law court. It originally processed only conflicts of the vassals of the shogunate, but later treated more general cases.

Although it aimed at accelerating trials and making them fair, the Hikitsuke tended to make rough-and-ready decisions in the late Kamakura period. The Hikitsukeshu were mostly occupied by the Hōjō clan. In addition, the Hikitsukeshu and Hyojoshu lost effective power to the yoriai, which was held at tokuso&#x27;s residence.

The Muromachi shogunate took over the system of Hikitsuke, but it lost its substantial meaning after Ashikaga Tadayoshi died, who controlled the Hikitsuke.

<text>The Vin Fiz Flyer is an early Wright Brothers Model EX pusher biplane that in 1911 became the first aircraft to fly coast-to-coast across the U.S., a journey that took almost three months.

==History==
The publisher William Randolph Hearst had offered a US$50,000 prize to the first aviator to fly coast to coast, in either direction, in less than 30 days from start to finish.

Calbraith Perry Rodgers, grandnephew of naval hero Oliver Hazard Perry and an avid yachtsman and motorcycle racer, had taken about 90 minutes of instruction from Orville Wright in June 1911 before soloing, and had won an $11,000 air endurance prize in a contest in August. Rodgers became the first private citizen to buy a Wright airplane, a Wright Model B modified and called the &quot;Model EX&quot;. The plane&#x27;s 35 horsepower (26 kilowatt) engine allowed a speed of at .

Since the airplane would need a considerable support crew, Rodgers persuaded J. Ogden Armour, of meatpacking fame, to sponsor the attempt, and in return named the plane after Armour&#x27;s new grape soft drink Vin Fiz. The support team rode on a three-car train called the &quot;Vin Fiz Special&quot;, and included Charlie Taylor, the Wright brothers&#x27; bicycle shop and aircraft mechanic, who built their first and later engines and knew every detail of Wright airplane construction; Rodgers&#x27; wife Mabel; his mother; reporters; and employees of Armour and Vin Fiz.

The flight began at 4:30 pm, September 17, 1911, when Rodgers took off from the Sheepshead Bay Race Track in Brooklyn, New York. Although the plan called for a large number of stops along the way, in the end there were 75, including 16 crashes, and Rodgers was injured several times. Taylor and the team of mechanics rebuilt the &quot;Vin Fiz Flyer&quot; when necessary, and only a few pieces of the original plane actually made the entire trip.

On November 5, having missed the prize deadline by 19 days, Rodgers landed in Pasadena, California, in front of a crowd of 20,000. On the 12th he took off for Long Beach, California, but crashed at Compton, with a brain concussion and a spinal twist. He was hospitalized for three weeks. Finally, on December 10 he landed on the beach, and taxied the &quot;Flyer&quot; into the Pacific Ocean, completing the unprecedented journey of over 4,000 statute miles (6,400 km). Actual flying time totalled under 84 hours. Rodgers was killed in an air crash on the Pacific shore of the US shortly after the flight across the US.

The aircraft was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1934, and eventually joined the collection of the National Air and Space Museum, after being fully restored for display by the Smithsonian in 1960. As of August 2009, the plane was still on display at the NASM but was undergoing further conservation.

In 1961, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first trans-continental flight, aviation historian and Boeing aeronautical engineer Peter M. Bowers built a reproduction of the Vin Fiz. Built to airworthy standards, the plane was flown as a towed glider, and subsequently became a display in the San Diego Air and Space Museum, where it remains (as of 2022).

In 1986 the &quot;Vin Fiz Flyer&quot; flight was re-enacted in a replica to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the original journey. The pilot was materials scientist Jim Lloyd.

==Mail==

In addition to the Vin Fiz endorsement, Mabel Rodgers used the flight to promote an airmail service, and sold special 25-cent postage stamps for items to be carried on the airplane. They were semi-official - the Post Office tolerated them, but insisted that mail carry regular stamps as well. The stamps were large, inscribed &quot;RODGERS AERIAL POST&quot; and &quot;VIN FIZ FLYER&quot;, with a picture of the airplane in the center. It is believed that they were ordered by Cal&#x27;s brother, Robert S. Rodgers, from a printer in Kansas City, Missouri, and they were probably first available around October 14.

Twelve &quot;Vin Fiz Flyer&quot; stamps are known to exist today - seven on postcards, one on a cover, and four individuals. One of the cards sold in 1999 for $88,000. Another one of the cards was only recently discovered; it was bought at an Internet auction for several hundred dollars, then auctioned by Siegel in December 2001 for $44,000.

Shreves Philatelic Galleries, Inc. held a specialized auction &quot;The Pioneers Of Flight Collection&quot; on Nov. 29, 2006 selling four stamps:
the only one on cover for $70,000 and three on postcards (for $60,000, $60,000 and $47,500).

<doc id="422362" wikidata="Q135367" url="?curid=422362" title="Kimberella">
<text>Kimberella is an extinct genus of marine bilaterian known only from rocks of the Ediacaran period. The slug-like organism fed by scratching the microbial surface on which it dwelt in a manner similar to the gastropods, although its affinity with this group is contentious.

Specimens were first found in Australia&#x27;s Ediacara Hills, but recent research has concentrated on the numerous finds near the White Sea in Russia, which cover an interval of time from . As with many fossils from this time, its evolutionary relationships to other organisms are hotly debated. Paleontologists initially classified &quot;Kimberella&quot; as a type of Cubozoan, but, since 1997, features of its anatomy and its association with scratch marks resembling those made by a radula have been interpreted as signs that it may have been a mollusc. Although some paleontologists dispute its classification as a mollusc, it is generally accepted as being at least a bilaterian.

The classification of &quot;Kimberella&quot; is important for the scientific understanding of the Cambrian explosion; if it was a mollusc, or at least a protostome, this would mean that the two dominant Nephrozoan lineages would have diverged significantly before , and if it was at least bilaterian, its age would indicate that animals were diversifying well before the start of the Cambrian.

== Etymology ==
The genus is named in honour of Mr. John Kimber, student, teacher, and collector; who lost his life during an expedition to Central Australia in 1964. Originally, the genus was given the name &quot;Kimberia&quot;, however, the name &quot;Kimberia&quot; was already in use as a subgenus of &quot;Turritella&quot; (Gastropoda), according to Dr. N. H. Ludbrook; and a new genus, &quot;Kimberella&quot;, was proposed by Mary Wade in 1972.

==Occurrence==
&quot;Kimberella&quot; has been found in the Ediacara Hills of South Australia, in the Ust&#x27; Pinega Formation in the White Sea region of northwest Russia, in the northeastern of Brazil, and the Kushk Series of central Iran. The White Sea fossils are often associated with the Ediacaran &quot;animals&quot; &quot;Tribrachidium&quot; and &quot;Dickinsonia,&quot; as well as meandering trace fossil trails (possibly made by &quot;Kimberella&quot; itself), and algae. Beds in the White Sea succession have been dated to and by radiometric dating, using uranium-lead ratios in zircons found in volcanic ash layers that are sandwiched between layers that contain &quot;Kimberella&quot; fossils. &quot;Kimberella&quot; fossils are also known from beds both older and younger than this precisely dated range. The fossils from the Ediacara Hills have not been dated precisely.

==Description==

Over 1,000 specimens, representing organisms of all stages of maturity, have now been found in the White Sea area at the bottom of fine-grained sandstone layers. The large number of specimens, the small grain-size of the sediments and the variety of circumstances in which specimens were preserved provide detailed information about &quot;Kimberella&quot;″s external form, internal anatomy, locomotion and feeding style.

All of the fossils are oval in outline. Elongated specimens illustrate that the organism was capable of stretching in an anterior-posterior direction, perhaps by as much as a factor of two. Like many other specimens found in the White Sea, the most common type of symmetry observed appears to be bilateral; with little to no sign of any of the kinds of radial symmetry found in Cnidarians, the group that includes jellyfish, sea anemones and hydras. The Australian fossils were originally described as a type of jellyfish, but this is inconsistent with the bilateral symmetry observed in the fossils. The White Sea fossils and the surrounding sediments also show that &quot;Kimberella&quot; lived on the surface of the sea-floor.

&quot;Kimberella&quot; had a dorsal covering that has been described as a (non-mineralized) &quot;soft shell&quot;; in larger specimens, this reached up to 15 cm in length, 5–7 cm in width, and 3–4 cm in height; with a minimum length of 2–3 mm.

The shell was stiff but flexible, and appears to not have been mineralized, becoming tougher as it grew larger (and presumably thicker) in more mature specimens. The deformation observed in elongated and folded specimens illustrates that the shell was highly malleable; perhaps, rather than a single integument, it consisted of an aggregation of mineralised sclerites. At the highest point was a hood-like structure, forming what is thought to be the front. In some specimens, the inner surface of the shell bears stripes spanning the width of the creature; these may represent points of muscle attachment. Similar stripes around the edge of the shell may have been connected to muscles that retracted the foot into the shell.

The long axis of the organism is marked by a raised ridge; the middle axis is slightly humped. Kimberella&#x27;s body had no visible segmentation but had a series of repeated &quot;modules&quot;. Each module included a well-developed band of dorso-ventral muscles running from the top to the single, broad, muscular &quot;foot&quot;, and smaller, transverse ventral muscles laterally across the underside of the body. The combination of these dorso-ventral and transverse ventral muscle bands enabled Kimberella to move by rippling its foot.

The body also had a frilled fringe that may have been part of the animal&#x27;s respiratory system, performing a function similar to that of gills. The fact that the fringe extended well beyond the shell may indicate that &quot;Kimberella&quot;″s &quot;gills&quot; were inefficient and needed a large area, or that there were no effective predators on &quot;Kimberella&quot; and the shell&#x27;s main function was to provide a platform for the muscles.

==Ecology==
&quot;Kimberella&quot; dwelt in shallow waters (up to tens of meters in depth), sharing the calm, well-oxygenated sea floor with photosynthetic organisms and microbial mats. Assemblages bearing &quot;Kimberella&quot; often also bear fossils of &quot;Andiva&quot;, &quot;Yorgia&quot;, &quot;Dickinsonia&quot;, &quot;Tribrachidium&quot; and &quot;Charniodiscus&quot;, suggesting that it lived alongside these organisms.

&quot;Kimberella&quot; probably grazed on microbial mats, but a selective predatory habit cannot be ruled out. Fossilized gut content seems to confirm it was grazing on bentic bacteria and algae, the latter having gone through their own ecological &quot;big bang&quot; 650 million years ago in the marine ecosystem, providing a more nutrient rich diet for early animals. Fedonkin reckons that as it ate, it moved &quot;backwards&quot;; the trail thus created was destroyed by the subsequent grazing activity. Conversely, Gehling et al. claim that it moved &#x27;forwards&#x27;. Fans of grooves are often found radiating from the &quot;head&quot; end of the organism; these indicate that the organism stayed in one place, and raked the surface of the microbial mat towards it by extension of its head, which bore two &quot;teeth&quot;. Gehling &quot;et al&quot;. reconstruct &quot;Kimberella&quot; as having a long neck that operated like the arm of a digger, rotating about an axis perpendicular to the sea floor in order to produce the sweep of the fan, and rotating towards and away from the animal to scrape food from the substrate to the mouth. In one community &quot;Kimberella&quot; has been shown to be avoiding its grazing traces, demonstrating complex sensory behaviour.

The lack of evidence of asexual reproduction suggests that the organisms reproduced sexually. Budding or fission has never been observed.

The waters in which &quot;Kimberella&quot; dwelt were occasionally disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In response to this stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow out of the sand that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised at the end of a burrow a few centimetres long.

==Preservation==

&quot;Kimberella&quot; fossils are generally preserved on top of clay-rich beds and beneath sandy beds. All fossils are preserved as depressions in the bases of beds, implying that the organism, although not mineralised, was firm enough to resist being crushed as sediment accumulated above it; as the soft parts of the organism decayed, the soft muds underneath would be squeezed up into the shell, preserving the shape of the organism.

Preservation of most specimens was made possible by the fast sedimentation that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; it may also have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily to play a role in binding sediment together.

==Classification==
All the &quot;Kimberella&quot; fossils found so far are assigned to one species, &quot;K. quadrata&quot;. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. They were originally classified as jellyfish by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and then as box jellyfish by Wade in 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these prompted a reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to &quot;Kimberella&quot; being recognised as the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a jellyfish at all.

So far, &quot;Kimberella&quot; fossils show no sign of a radula, the toothed chitinous &quot;tongue&quot; that is the diagnostic feature of modern molluscs, excluding bivalves. Since radulae are very rarely preserved in fossil molluscs, its absence does not necessarily mean that &quot;K. quadrata&quot; did not have one. The rocks in the immediate vicinity of &quot;Kimberella&quot; fossils bear scratch marks that have been compared to those made by the radulae of molluscs as they graze on microbial mats. These traces, named &quot;Radulichnus&quot; and &quot;Kimberichnus&quot;, have been interpreted as circumstantial evidence for the presence of a radula. In conjunction with the univalve shell, this has been taken to indicate &quot;Kimberella&quot; was a mollusc or very closely related to molluscs. In 2001 and 2007, Fedonkin suggested that the feeding mechanism might be a retractable proboscis with hook-like organs at its end. &quot;Kimberella&quot;″s feeding apparatus appears to differ significantly from the typical mollusc radula, and this demonstrates that &quot;Kimberella&quot; is at best a stem-group mollusc. Notably, the scratch marks indicate that the &#x27;teeth&#x27; were dragged towards the organism, not pushed away as in molluscs, and that the maximum impact on the sediment was when the mouthpart was furthest from the organism. The direction of grazing is also backwards, as opposed to forwards as in molluscs. Furthermore, the constant width of grooves implies stereoglossy – a trait that is very derived in molluscs. It has been argued that the shape of the feeding traces is incompatible with a radula, and that despite the molluscan body form, the lack of a radula places &quot;Kimberella&quot; well outside the molluscan crown group. Butterfield points out that plenty of other groups of organisms bear structures capable of making similar marks.

Taken together, sceptics doubt that the available evidence is enough to reliably identify &quot;Kimberella&quot; as a mollusc or near-mollusc, and suggest that it is presumptuous to call it anything more than a &quot;possible&quot; mollusc, or even just a &quot;probable bilaterian&quot;.

Possible known relative of &quot;Kimberella&quot; is &quot;Solza margarita&quot; from Russia. Some use grouping &quot;Kimberellomorpha&quot; for those two genera, and some even consider that &quot;Solza&quot; would be taphonomic variety of &quot;Kimberella&quot;.

==Theoretical importance==

The Cambrian explosion is an apparently rapid increase in the variety of basic body structures of animals in the Early Cambrian period, starting after and finishing before . A few of the Early Cambrian fossils were already known in the mid-19th century, and Charles Darwin saw the apparently sudden appearance and diversification of animals as one of the main objections that could be made against his theory of evolution by natural selection.

The majority of animals more complex than jellyfish and other cnidarians are split into two groups, the protostomes and deuterostomes. The mollusc-like features of &quot;Kimberella&quot; strongly suggest that it was a member of the protostomes. If so, this means that the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have split some time before &quot;Kimberella&quot; appeared — at least , and hence well before the start of the Cambrian . Even if it is not a protostome, it is widely accepted as a member of the more inclusive bilaterian clade. Since fossils of rather modern-looking cnidarians have been found in the Doushantuo lagerstätte, the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages would have diverged well over .

<doc id="422365" wikidata="Q1126517" url="?curid=422365" title="Jō">
<text>A is an approximately wooden staff, used in some Japanese martial arts. The martial art of wielding the jō is called &quot;jōjutsu&quot; or &quot;jōdō&quot;. Also, &quot;aiki-jō&quot; is a set of techniques in aikido which uses the jō to illustrate aikido&#x27;s principles with a weapon. The jō staff is shorter than the &quot;bō&quot;. Today, the jō is still used by some Japanese police forces.

==Legendary origin==
The techniques for jō were reportedly invented by Musō Gonnosuke Katsuyoshi (夢想 權之助 勝吉, fl. c.1605, date of death unknown) after he was defeated by the famous swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, 1584–1645). They fought each other in a duel sometime between 1608 and 1611, according to Kenji Tokitsu. The record mentioning this duel, the , recounts:

When Musashi was in Edo, he met an adept named Musō Gonnosuke, who asked to fight him. Gonnosuke used a wooden sword. Musashi was in the process of making a small Bō; he picked up a piece of firewood. Gonnosuke attacked him without even bowing, but he received a blow from Musashi that made him fall down. He was impressed and left.

A different text, the &quot;Kaijo Monogatari&quot; (dated to 1666) differs considerably from the &quot;Nitenki&quot; version. In it, Gonnosuke is a boastful and brash warrior who duels Musashi intending to see how Musashi compares with Musashi&#x27;s father in swordsmanship. The fight occurs in Akashi, not Edo, and Gonnosuke wields a staff four &quot;shaku&quot; in length and reinforced with steel rings. After his defeat, he then went to Mount Hōman-zan in Chikuzen (near Fukuoka), where he practiced considerably, changing his preferred weapon to four &quot;shaku&quot; and two &quot;sun&quot; in length – as compared to . 

The school he founded to transmit his techniques has some old records which claims that Gonnosuke, struck by his defeat, went into solitary meditation until he received divine inspiration in a dream; he then invented techniques to fight against Musashi&#x27;s two swords using only a stick, and defeated Musashi on their next encounter. Assuming the records are accurate and genuine, this would be the only time Musashi was defeated, as the vast majority of documentation states that Musashi was never defeated.

==Subsequent history==
Several traditional Japanese &quot;koryū&quot; (&quot;old schools&quot; of martial arts) used the jō like a sword. The added length of the jō was meant to give it an advantage over the sword. Further, its wood construction allowed a fighter to improvise a jō quickly from a tree, branch, or other pole.

<text>Spark New Zealand Limited is a New Zealand telecommunications and digital services company providing fixed-line telephone services, mobile phone services, broadband, and digital technology services (including cloud, security, digital transformation, and managed services). Its customers range from consumers to small - medium business, government agencies and large enterprise clients. It was formerly known as Telecom New Zealand until it was rebranded to Spark on 8 August 2014. It has operated as a publicly traded company since 1990. Spark&#x27;s mobile network reaches 98% of New Zealand, with over 2.7 million mobile connections and 687,000 broadband connections

Spark is one of the largest companies by value on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). As of 2007, it was the 39th largest telecommunications company in the OECD. The company is part of New Zealand Telecommunications Forum. 

Telecom New Zealand was formed in 1987 from a division of the New Zealand Post Office, and privatised in 1990. In 2008, Telecom was operationally separated into three divisions under local loop unbundling initiatives by central government – Telecom Retail; Telecom Wholesale; and Chorus, the network infrastructure division. This separation effectively ended any remnants of monopoly that Telecom Retail once had in the market. In 2011 the demerger process was complete, with Telecom and Chorus becoming separate listed companies. 

Spark has 63 retail locations around New Zealand, including 16 in Auckland.

==History==
The Postal Services Act 1987 split the then New Zealand Post Office into New Zealand Post Limited (trading as NZPost), Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited (trading as Telecom) and Post Office Bank Limited (trading as PostBank, sold to ANZ in 1989) and all three industries progressively deregulated. The selling price of Telecom was considered by some to be extremely low, given that Telecom had a monopoly of all phone lines in New Zealand at the time.

===1990s===
In 1990, Telecom was sold to two United States–based telecommunications companies, Verizon Communications (formerly Bell Atlantic) and Ameritech, for NZ$4.25 billion. After Telecom was privatized, the Kiwi Share agreement was drawn up, which included a provision that the company retained free local calling for residential customers.

In 1991, Telecom listed on the New Zealand, Australian and New York stock exchanges. The following year Telecom implemented a NZ$200 million fibre-optic cable connection between Australia and New Zealand. Also in 1991, Roderick Deane was appointed CEO of the company. Then in 1993 Ameritech and Bell Atlantic reduced their share in Telecom to a combined 49.6% and BellSouth New Zealand Limited (BellSouth), subsequently acquired by Vodafone, set up the first mobile network to compete with Telecom.

Clear Communications reached an agreement with Telecom in 1995 on local service interconnection. Also in 1995, Telecom created First Media Ltd to develop a cable television network across Auckland and Wellington, called First TV. In 1996 Telecom established a telephone exchange in the United States for international traffic, and launched Xtra.

1997 saw Telecom buy back NZ$1 billion of its shares. The following year, Ameritech sold down its 24.8% shareholding in an international public offering, and Bell Atlantic issued exchangeable notes that were convertible into the Telecom shares that it owned.

In December 1997 Patricia Reddy was appointed to the Telecom board. She remained on it until 2008. In September 2016 as Dame Patsy Reddy she became the Governor General of New Zealand.

In 1998, Southern Cross Cables Limited (half owned by Telecom) announced plans to build a fibre-optic cable linking New Zealand with Australia and North America.
Vodafone Group bought BellSouth and started a campaign to attract Telecom customers to its network. 

In 1999, Telecom established a presence in Australia, buying 78% of AAPT, Australia&#x27;s third-largest telecommunications company. Telecom upgraded its nationwide payphone network to smart card technology. Telecom&#x27;s broadband Internet service based on ADSL technology, called JetStream, was launched and rolled-out progressively in local exchanges. Also at this time, Telecom began charging customers who connected to the Internet using a local dial up number, forcing all ISPs in New Zealand to change to an 0867 dial up number. This resulted in complaints that this was in breach of Telecom&#x27;s Kiwishare Agreement where residential customers are allowed free local calling. The decade was rounded off with Theresa Gattung being appointed new CEO of Telecom, with Rod Deane moving to the position of chairman.

===2000s===

In 2000, Xtra signed up its 300,000th customer. Telecom also raised its shareholding in AAPT to 100%.

Evidence emerged in early 2002 of Telecom having exploited an ill-considered, or fraudulently made to order, accounting standard (FRS38) to inflate its year 2001 reported profit by some $263 million. This standard required holding companies to incorporate profits and losses of associate companies into their group accounts by way of &quot;equity accounting&quot; except when the associate is insolvent. Being insolvent has been wrongly taken as substantial evidence that the holding company will no longer share in the associates profits and losses. The associate company Southern Cross Cables paid Telecom $263 million in dividends as per (note 2 of) Telecom&#x27;s 2001 annual accounts, $US200m as per Southern Cross&#x27;s annual accounts. Southern Cross opened for (limited) business in November 2000 and its income from operations to 30 June 2001 was only $US13 million ($US55 million for the 2002 year). Southern Cross were insolvent to the extent of $US24 million as at 30 June 2000 and this increased to $US280 million as at June 2001 as a result of the dividends and other (net) expenses ($328 million in 2002). The dividends were treated as income in Telecom&#x27;s accounts there being nothing in FRS 28 to say that they should not be although such inclusion did breach an overall requirement that the accounts present a fair view.

In 2003, a new logo was launched.

In 2004, Telecom purchased Gen-i Ltd (in May) and Computerland Ltd (in September). The company had 36 retail stores around the country. During the year, the company won the Roger Award for The Worst Transnational Corporation operating in New Zealand.

In 2005, Telecom introduced &quot;Bitstream&quot;, a 256 kbit ADSL service sold at wholesale prices (at approximately 10% below the retail price) to other ISPs. Telecom also posted a profit of NZ$916 million. The company also launched online retail store Ferrit launches with about 150 retailers.

;2006
* 9 May: An audio clip recorded on 2 March was released involving Telecom CEO Theresa Gattung admitting the use of confusion as a chief marketing tool in the industry. The March recording also dismissed the New Zealand Government as &quot;too smart to do anything dumb&quot; with regards to regulation.
* Late May: Roderick Deane resigns as chairman, and is replaced by Wayne Boyd the following month.
* July: Matt Crockett is appointed CEO of Telecom&#x27;s newly formed Wholesale division.
* All Computerland branches around New Zealand are rebranded as Gen-i.

;2007
* 16 January: The Librarians Association of New Zealand put in a complaint about a Telecom advertisement where 3 young school children state that, &quot;Only dumb kids read books, brainy kids have broadband.&quot; Originally Telecom stated that is the views of the young children and not Telecom and the advertisement was unscripted, later that week Telecom choose to edit the advertisement to remove the comments made by the children.
* 19 January: It is reported that Paritai Drive, Ōrākei, one of the richest streets in Auckland, is still not capable of receiving a broadband SL service and there are many other well populated areas around New Zealand still not capable of receiving broadband. Opposition Woosh Wireless immediately tested their service in the area and gave residents the opportunity to join their wireless broadband service.
* 5 February: Telecom announces that from March 2007 they will begin rolling out ADSL2+, more than a year after originally stated for roll out.
*31 March: Telecom shuts down its old 025 D-AMPS/TDMA network with all 025 phones changed to 027 (CDMA).
*May 2007: British Telecom have been in discussion with the New Zealand government regarding Telecom&#x27;s monopoly control of the NZ broadband network. Three to four years previously, British Telecom were in a similar position to that which NZ Telecom are now in; the British broadband network has since been broken up and the NZ government are keen to learn and possibly copy the development/regulatory/investment model used by the British firm.
*The Auckland Chamber of Commerce publicly stated that if Telecom did not invest in a next-generation high-speed network, comparable with that of other Western nations, they would fund a private fibre-optic based service in the 100 megabit speed range. The proposed coverage of this would be within 200m of a path running south from Auckland CBD (situated to allow as many businesses as possible to connect). Any company or private individual within this range would be offered a connection.
*28 June: Telecom announced that Paul Reynolds, CEO of BT Wholesale, has been selected as the new CEO, to start on 27 September. Simon Moutter was appointed as acting CEO in the interim.
*30 June: Theresa Gattung steps down as CEO, with a reported leaving payment of $5.125 million.
*27 September: Dr Paul Reynolds starts as CEO of Telecom.
*In November 2007, the Boost Mobile brand was discontinued in New Zealand by Telecom.

===Mobile network===
Telecom started the first cellular network service using AMPS in 1987. This transitioned to D-AMPS TDMA digital services in the early 1990s. The service in the 800 MHz band gave great geographic coverage.

In 1996 Telecom introduced an innovative and first-to-market wireless data cellular network known as CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) that provided IP connections with mobility. Introduced to the market by the product manager, David Beale, they succeeded in the very first IoT-device connections in the region connecting, amongst other things, Coke&#x27;s vending machines, NZ Post&#x27;s couriers and parcel tracking, and telemetry data from the Americas Cup yacht races in Auckland to feed a realtime TV graphics service.

Telecom Mobile, the mobile division of Telecom, reached 500,000 mobile customers connected to its network in 1998, which doubled to one million customers by 2000.

In 2005, a phreaker exposed a vulnerability with the mobile network, allowing public access to almost anyone&#x27;s voicemail; in response to concerns over privacy and security, this network issue was resolved.

On 31 March 2007, the 025 D-AMPS (&quot;TDMA&quot;) cellular network was closed down. Then on 8 June of that year, Telecom Mobile announced plans to build a hybrid W-CDMA/UMTS-CDMA 850 MHz network, based on the WCDMA HSPA technology, to eventually replace its current CDMA EV-DO network. On 29 May 2009, Telecom launched its new network, branded as &quot;XT&quot;, to the public.

In December 2009 and February 2010, Telecom&#x27;s new XT Mobile Network experienced high-profile failures for many customers in locations from Taupo south, due to a radio network controller failure in Christchurch. As a result of the loss of service Telecom offered a $5 million compensation package for its customers.

In April 2010, Telecom released its first Android handset on the XT Mobile Network, the LG GW620.

On 31 July 2012, the Telecom CDMA mobile network was closed down.

In September 2013, Telecom officially launched new Ultra Mobile branding and plans. These plans included a free 4G upgrade (4G was made available two months later in November 2013) with a 1GB of data per day from Telecom WiFi hotspots. In October 2013, Telecom sought clearance to acquire management rights for parts of the 700 MHz spectrum with the intention of developing of its 4G mobile network.

Spark New Zealand along with fellow telecommunications companies 2degrees and One New Zealand intend to end their 2G and 3G by 31 December 2025.

===Industry regulation and company restructuring===
In 2000, the New Zealand Government conducted a comprehensive review of the regulatory regime in the telecommunications industry. Subsequently, in 2001 the Telecommunications Act was passed, which among other things established the role of a Telecommunications Commissioner.

In a decision by the Government on 3 May 2006, Telecom was forced to unbundle the local loop, to provide &quot;access to fast, competitively priced broadband internet&quot;. The decision significantly affected the company&#x27;s market share, and allowed competitors (such as TelstraClear, Orcon and ihug) to offer broadband and other communications services throughout New Zealand by installing their own equipment in exchanges. The announcement of this decision was rushed ahead of schedule, as the documents were leaked to Telecom who advised the government of the leak. It was widely reported that the government had intended to make the announcement during the 2006 Budget. Most of Telecom&#x27;s competitors and many independent commentators such as InternetNZ and Paul Budde applauded the decision, with opposition to unbundling coming from the Business Roundtable, Federated Farmers, and Bruce Sheppard (representing Telecom shareholders). Legislation was introduced to enable the regulatory changes. Three other political parties (New Zealand First, the Green Party and United Future) supported the decision, which would give the government at least 66 votes if there were no votes against the party line. The main opposition National Party initially opposed the unbundling decision, but later voted in favour of it after a select committee hearing. This left the ACT Party alone in opposing the decision.

The company was then affected by a series of other government decisions. Firstly, in early-June 2006 the Commerce Commission ruled on the contentious issue of mobile telephone termination charges, announcing that calls between a landline and a mobile phone within a geographically defined boundary could be connected free of termination charges. This ruling allowed Vodafone New Zealand to establish a mobile phone product which could also provide free local calling. Then, the Commerce Commission granted two of Telecom&#x27;s competitors, CallPlus and ihug, access to an unrestricted, Unbundled Bitstream Service, which would allow them to provide competitive broadband services.

On 27 June 2006, the company announced that it would voluntarily separate its business into two separate operating business units – Wholesale and Retail. The Government introduced the Telecommunications Amendment Bill in November 2006 to force Telecom to open its network to competitors. The bill officially split Telecom into three business units from 31 March 2008, with network access separated from the wholesale and retail units.

In January 2012 Telecom launched a new Mobile Network aimed at the youth market named Skinny Mobile.

On 28 March 2013, Telecom announced that it would reduce staff levels by constraint on recruitment activity and redundancies. This followed from speculation by MP Clare Curran that up to 1500 jobs would be cut from the company.

==Spark Broadband==
Spark is New Zealand&#x27;s largest internet service provider. It was formerly named Xtra. The next largest ISP in the New Zealand market is One NZ, a position it acquired when it purchased TelstraClear in 2012.

Spark offers asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL), fibre to the premises (FTTP) fixed-line broadband, and Wireless Broadband.

==Spark Mobile==

Spark NZ is New Zealand&#x27;s largest mobile operator by market-share. As of 2021, Spark NZ had 41% of the New Zealand market, beating competitor One NZ (then called Vodafone) who was at 38%. Telecom&#x27;s mobile network was branded as &quot;XT&quot;, and operates at 850 MHz nationwide (with some 2100 MHz overlay in urban areas), and delivers 3G data connectivity wherever there is coverage.

Telecom originally operated a TDMA (AMPS, Digital D-AMPS/TDMA) mobile network; this was superseded by its CDMA network. The TDMA network was turned off on 31 March 2007, and most of its customers migrated to CDMA. The CDMA EV-DO network was marketed as T3G, a 2 MB third-generation mobile system. Telecom announced on 8 June 2007 the intention to build a W-CDMA/UMTS network, to be called XT Mobile Network, based on WCDMA HSPA technology, to replace its current CDMA EV-DO network. The network was launched on 29 May 2009. The CDMA network ran in parallel with XT until it was shut down on 31 July 2012.

The TDMA network used the 025 mobile prefix, using a mixture of six- and seven-digit subscriber numbers. With the switch to CDMA, Telecom migrated to the 027 prefix and standardised the subscriber numbers to seven digits, adding a 4 to the beginning of old six-digit numbers.

===Customer numbers and market share===

Spark competes with One NZ, 2degrees and mobile virtual network operators for market share. In November 2015, Spark had 2,200,000 mobile customers at 40% market share.

In 2021, it was estimated that Spark NZ held a 41% market share in New Zealand.

The following shows customer numbers and market share information for Telecom Mobile, covering both the now-shut-down TDMA and CDMA networks and Spark&#x27;s current 3G, 4G, and 5G networks.

==Spark Sport==
Spark Sport was a New Zealand sports streaming service, owned and operated by Spark. The service was launched on 14 March 2019 after Spark obtained the New Zealand broadcast rights to various World Rugby events including the 2019 Rugby World Cup a year earlier. During that time, Spark Sport obtained the rights to several other sports to build its catalog, until the streaming service was ready for launch, coverage was sublicienced to TVNZ to screen. Its first major live sport broadcast was the streaming of the 2019 Australian F1 Grand Prix.

There were concerns that Spark&#x27;s broadcast of the Rugby World Cup would struggle under New Zealand&#x27;s internet capabilities especially in rural communities and anticipated audience numbers streaming matches resulting in similar issues to Optus Sport&#x27;s broadcasting FIFA World Cup 2018 in Australia. On the second day of the Rugby World Cup, Spark Sport suffered technical issues during its live stream of the match between New Zealand and South Africa leaving viewers unable to watch the game, as a result broadcast of the second half was simulcast of traditional television on TVNZ Duke as part of a contingency plan with free-to-air broadcaster TVNZ for issues during the Rugby World Cup. Viewers would continue to report issues throughout the tournament, despite the issues Spark responded noting that there were no issues from their end in the broadcast feed and that the issues experienced were due to the individual viewer&#x27;s set up configuration of their streaming devices.

Following its broadcast of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Spark Sport announced it had secured a six-year broadcast deal with New Zealand Cricket for all domestic and international cricket played within New Zealand. The rights had been previously held by Sky Sport for over 25 years. Spark Sport&#x27;s coverage of cricket is presented by Scotty Stevenson, with regular analysts and commentators including Mark Richardson, Craig McMillan, Craig Cumming, Brendon McCullum, Grant Elliott, Stephen Fleming, Rebecca Rolls and Frances Mackay. American outside broadcast (OB) provider Gravity Media provided the equipment to cover Spark&#x27;s coverage, brought over from Australia. This was due to the country&#x27;s main OB company On Site Broadcasting being owned by Sky Television and had &#x27;Sky Sport&#x27; livery on most of its OB trucks. UK&#x27;s Whisper TV provided the overall production element. During the 2022/23 season NEP Group was given the outside broadcast contract, which, ironically, bought OSB from Sky in 2020 and all trucks rebranded with NEP livery.

Spark Sport was the host broadcaster for the 2021 Rugby World Cup held in New Zealand.

Spark had previously broadcast sport through its subscription video on-demand service Lightbox partnering with Coliseum Sports Media to deliver a subscription-based sports streaming service called Lightbox Sport streaming golf, English Premier League football and French Top 14 rugby.

In December 2022, Spark Sport announced that it would be shutting down in the second half of 2023 due to a combination of financial and technical problems. The remaining three years broadcasting rights for all New Zealand Cricket international and domestic games within New Zealand would go to TVNZ from 1 July 2023. The Formula 1 had moved to Sky TV and Sky Sport.

==Criticism==
When Telecom held a general monopoly in New Zealand telecommunications, it was criticised for using its incumbent status to charge high prices. Prices have subsequently dropped as competition in the market has increased.

Competitors alleged that Telecom engaged in unfair practices to prevent them from gaining ground, for example by reselling broadband capacity to Xtra at lower prices than to other ISPs. In July 2005, two dozen Internet service providers formally complained to New Zealand&#x27;s Commerce Commission via a letter. Notably absent from the list of signatories were Telecom&#x27;s ISP, Xtra, and several ISPs owned by its main competitor, TelstraClear. On 1 February 2007 the Consumers&#x27; Institute gave its &quot;supreme ass award&quot; for bad products to Telecom for its Xtra broadband service, Consumers Institute executive director David Russell claimed that since Telecom &quot;unleashed&quot; its broadband speeds, the institute had been &quot;inundated with complaints of slower speeds and frustrating cutouts&quot;. Telecom has been given the Roger Award more than once, in 2004 and 2007 – and only the second company awarded as such, with the defunct TranzRail being the first.

The New Zealand Treasury once estimated the economic loss from Telecom&#x27;s (now former) monopoly to be in the region of $50–$250 million a year. Another study commissioned in 1998 by competitor Clear (later TelstraClear) estimated that the loss was $400 million a year. At a retail level Telecom now faces competition in all areas — cellular, internet, toll-calls and, subject to ongoing developments, in local calling. At a network level these retail services often resell Telecom wholesale products.

Telecom claimed one reason for poor broadband uptake in New Zealand was because of the fact New Zealand residential subscribers enjoy free local calling. Telecom stated &quot;customers have the option of moving to faster broadband services, but free local calling creates a disincentive by allowing them to use dial-up for as long they want&quot; (i.e. they do not have to pay a per-minute call charge while using dial-up, unlike many other countries where local calls are charged for). However, some experts and competitors disagreed – including the secretary of the OECD.

Telecom failed to reach their self-imposed goal of around 83,333 wholesale broadband customers by the end of 2005. During her opening address to parliament, Prime Minister Helen Clark criticised the state of the internet in New Zealand. This was followed by extensive criticism in the media such as in two high-profile television programmes, in two episodes of &quot;Campbell Live&quot; (whose past major sponsors include Telecom), during which CEO Theresa Gattung was challenged by host John Campbell, and an episode of the New Zealand edition of &quot;Sunday&quot;. Critical articles had been published by various magazines and newspapers, including the largest newspaper, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;. Of significance, many of these were lengthy and high-profile articles compared to many previous articles critical of Telecom — among the most noticeable of these was published by the &quot;National Business Review&quot;, in which it was stated that &quot;Far from being &#x27;Xtraordinary&#x27;, as its multimillion dollar advertising would have you believe, Telecom is strangling the nation&#x27;s advancement.&quot; While in Wellington for an ICANN meeting, Vint Cerf was reported to have made a personal visit to David Cunliffe, the telecommunications minister where it is believed he recommended that Telecom be unbundled. The government investigated whether it needed to force Telecom to unbundle the network, thereby allowing other companies access and improving broadband service for consumers.

From 2007, Yahoo! provided Telecom&#x27;s email service, which came under heavy criticism in early 2013 following a spam and phishing attack described as the biggest to have ever hit the country. Telecom and Yahoo! automatically reset tens of thousands of users&#x27; passwords. In April, Telecom announced that despite the issue, it would keep Yahoo! on as an email provider. Problems with Telecom&#x27;s YahooXtra email continued into December 2013 and further into 2014 with the latest problems reported on 10 January. They later moved their mail service to SMX, a New Zealand-based provider, in May 2017.

<text>The  () is a highland region in south-central France consisting of mountains and plateaus. It covers about 15% of mainland France.

Subject to volcanism that has subsided in the last 10,000 years, these central mountains are separated from the Alps by a deep north–south cleft created by the Rhône river and known in French as the (literally &quot;Rhône furrow&quot;). The region was a barrier to transport within France until the opening of the A75 motorway, which not only made north–south travel easier but also opened access to the massif itself.

== Geography and geology ==
The is an old massif, formed during the Variscan orogeny, consisting mostly of granitic and metamorphic rocks. It was powerfully raised and made to look geologically younger in the eastern section by the uplift of the Alps during the Paleogene period and in the southern section by the uplift of the Pyrenees. The massif thus presents a strongly asymmetrical elevation profile with highlands in the south and in the east (Cévennes) dominating the valley of the Rhône and the plains of Languedoc and, by contrast, the less elevated region of in the northwest.

These tectonic movements created faults and may be at the origin of the volcanism in the massif (but the hypothesis is not proved yet). In fact, above the crystalline foundation, one can observe many volcanoes of many different types and ages: volcanic plateaus (Aubrac, Cézallier), stratovolcanoes (Mounts of Cantal, ), and small, very recent monogenic volcanoes (, ). The entire region contains a large concentration of around 450 extinct volcanoes. The (near Clermont-Ferrand), a range running north to south and less than long, contains 115 of them (monogenic volcanoes only). The Auvergne Volcanoes regional natural park is in the massif. The amusement park of Vulcania near Clermont-Ferrand allows visitors to discover this natural heritage and introduces them to volcanology.

In the south, one remarkable region is made up of features called &quot;&quot; in French and consists of raised limestone plateaus cut by very deep canyons. The most famous of them is the Gorges du Tarn (Tarn Canyon).

==Mountains==
Mountain ranges, with notable individual mountains, are (roughly north to south):
** Puy de Dôme ()
** Puy de Pariou ()
** Puy de Lassolas ()
** Puy de la Vache ()
** Puy de Sancy ()
* Monts du Lyonnais
* Pilat massif
** Crêt de la Perdrix ()
* Mounts of Cantal
** Plomb du Cantal ()
** Puy Mary ()
* Forez mountains
** Pierre-sur-Haute ()
** Signal de Mailhebiau ()
* Margeride
** Signal de Randon ()
** Mont Mouchet ()
** ()
** Mont Gerbier de Jonc ()
* Cévennes
** Mont Lozère (), the highest non-volcanic summit
** (), near Le Vigan, Florac
* Monts de Lacaune
** Montgrand ()
* Monts de l&#x27;Espinouse
** Sommet de l&#x27;Espinouse ()
* Montagne Noire
** Pic de Nore ()

==Plateaus==
* 
* Plateau de Lévézou
* Causse du Comtal
* Causse de Sauveterre
* Causse de Sévérac
* Causse Méjean
* Causse Noir
* Causse de Blandas

==Administration==
The following departments are generally considered as part of the : Allier, , , , , , , , , , , , Loire, , , , , , , and ; these form parts of the regions of , , and Occitania.

The largest cities in the region are Clermont-Ferrand, Limoges, and Saint-Étienne.

==Economy==
In the Massif Central, the industry remains little developed except locally (metallurgy in Saint-Étienne; tires in Clermont-Ferrand, headquarters of Michelin, world leader in the sector; aeronautics industry in Figeac, etc.). The other industries present are linked to agriculture (Groupe Limagrain, the world&#x27;s third-largest seed producer and cheese-producing industries that export to the world such as Cantal and Roquefort).
On the agricultural level, the Limagne plain is dominated by major cereal crops, but in the mountains, it is mainly livestock farming that predominates: cattle farming in the west for meat and milk (Cantal cheese), sheep farming in the south on the limestone plateaus (Roquefort cheese).

Finally, tourism is booming, taking advantage of the UNESCO heritage classification of the volcanoes of the and the Causses and Cévennes region.

The entire economy of the has benefited from the opening of roads, particularly the construction of the A75 motorway on which is located the famous Millau Viaduct.

<text>Monolithic microwave integrated circuit, or MMIC (sometimes pronounced &quot;mimic&quot;), is a type of integrated circuit (IC) device that operates at microwave frequencies (300 MHz to 300 GHz). These devices typically perform functions such as microwave mixing, power amplification, low-noise amplification, and high-frequency switching. Inputs and outputs on MMIC devices are frequently matched to a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. This makes them easier to use, as cascading of MMICs does not then require an external matching network. Additionally, most microwave test equipment is designed to operate in a 50-ohm environment.

MMICs are dimensionally small (from around 1 mm2 to 10 mm2) and can be mass-produced, which has allowed the proliferation of high-frequency devices such as cellular phones. MMICs were originally fabricated using gallium arsenide (GaAs), a III-V compound semiconductor. It has two fundamental advantages over silicon (Si), the traditional material for IC realisation: device (transistor) speed and a semi-insulating substrate. Both factors help with the design of high-frequency circuit functions. However, the speed of Si-based technologies has gradually increased as transistor feature sizes have reduced, and MMICs can now also be fabricated in Si technology. The primary advantage of Si technology is its lower fabrication cost compared with GaAs. Silicon wafer diameters are larger (typically 8&quot; to 12&quot; compared with 4&quot; to 8&quot; for GaAs) and the wafer costs are lower, contributing to a less expensive IC.

Originally, MMICs used metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) as the active device. More recently high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMTs), pseudomorphic HEMTs and heterojunction bipolar transistors have become common.

Other III-V technologies, such as indium phosphide (InP), have been shown to offer superior performance to GaAs in terms of gain, higher cutoff frequency, and low noise. However, they also tend to be more expensive due to smaller wafer sizes and increased material fragility.

Silicon germanium (SiGe) is a Si-based compound semiconductor technology offering higher-speed transistors than conventional Si devices but with similar cost advantages.

Gallium nitride (GaN) is also an option for MMICs. Because GaN transistors can operate at much higher temperatures and work at much higher voltages than GaAs transistors, they make ideal power amplifiers at microwave frequencies.

<text>George Richards Minot ( ; December 2, 1885 – February 25, 1950) was an American medical researcher who shared the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George Hoyt Whipple and William P. Murphy for their pioneering work on pernicious anemia.

==Early life==
George Richards Minot was born in Boston, Massachusetts to James Jackson Minot (1853–1938) and Elizabeth Whitney. He was namesake of his great-great-grandfather George Richards Minot (1758–1802). His father was a physician; his father&#x27;s cousin was anatomist Charles Sedgwick Minot (1852–1914); one of his great-grandfathers was James Jackson (1777–1867), co-founder of Massachusetts General Hospital. He developed interest, first, in the natural sciences, and then, in medicine.

==Education==
Minot obtained his B.A. from Harvard College in 1908, where he was elected to The Owl Club, and obtained his M.D. degree in 1912 from the Harvard Medical School. Between 1913 and 1915, he worked in the William Henry Howell&#x27;s lab at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, studying blood thinning proteins, such as antithrombin. In 1915, he secured a junior position on the medical staff of the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he started research on blood anemia. During the first world war, he served as a surgeon in for the US Army. As part of those duties, he worked with Alice Hamilton to understand what was causing workers at a munitions plant in New Jersey to become ill. They eventually discovered that skin contact with TNT led to the sicknesses.

==Career==
In 1917, he came to Collis P. Huntington Memorial Hospital in Boston; he became chief of medical services in 1923, and was appointed physician-in-chief in 1934. In addition, Minot became professor of medicine at the Harvard University, and was appointed director of the Thorndik Memorial Laboratory at Boston City Hospital. He also worked in the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital as a staff member. He was a member of the Pernicious Anemia Committee at Harvard and served on the Anti-Anemia Preparation Advisory Board of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.

Minot was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1926. In 1930, Minot was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh with William P. Murphy. Minot shared the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with William P. Murphy and George H. Whipple given for their work on the treatment of blood anemia. They all discovered an effective treatment for pernicious anemia, which was a terminal disease at the time, with liver concentrate high in vitamin B12, later identified as the critical compound in the treatment. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1935 and a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1937.

Minot was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in 1921 at the age of 35, by Dr Elliott P. Joslin, a fellow professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the leading diabetes doctors of his time. Diabetes was a fatal disease at the time. Joslin kept him alive the only way he knew, by restricting food. Minot was 6 feet one inches tall and only weighed 135 pounds. Joslin put him on a diet of only 530 calories per day. Minot, like most every diabetes patient, at the time, would probably die within a year.

However, insulin was discovered at about the same time Minot was diagnosed. Insulin became widely available about a year later Dr. William Castle observed that Frederick Banting&#x27;s and Charles Best&#x27;s discovery of insulin in 1921, not only transformed diabetes treatment, but also, by keeping Minot alive, contributed towards the discovery of a cure for pernicious anemia. Minot and Murphy&#x27;s famous paper &quot;Treatment of pernicious anemia by a special diet&quot; was published in 1926.

Minot began developing complications associated with diabetes in 1940, and suffered a serious stroke in 1947, which partially paralyzed him. He died in Brookline, Massachusetts on February 25, 1950. He was a Unitarian. His home in Brookline, Massachusetts, was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition for his work.

Minot and his wife Marian Linzee Minot (Weld) (1890–1979), whom he married in 1915, had two daughters and a son.

<doc id="422387" wikidata="Q476466" url="?curid=422387" title="Martin Hellman">
<text>Martin Edward Hellman (born October 2, 1945) is an American cryptologist and mathematician, best known for his invention of public-key cryptography in cooperation with Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle. Hellman is a longtime contributor to the computer privacy debate, and has applied risk analysis to a potential failure of nuclear deterrence.

Hellman was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2002 for contributions to the theory and practice of cryptography.

In 2016, he wrote a book with his wife, Dorothie Hellman, that links creating love at home to bringing peace to the planet (&quot;A New Map for Relationships: Creating True Love at Home and Peace on the Planet&quot;).

==Early life==
Born in New York to a Jewish family, Hellman graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. He went on to take his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from New York University in 1966, and at Stanford University he received a master&#x27;s degree and a Ph.D. in the discipline in 1967 and 1969.

== Career ==
From 1968 to 1969 he worked at IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, where he encountered Horst Feistel. From 1969 to 1971, he was an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined Stanford University electrical engineering department in 1971 as an assistant professor and served on the full-time faculty for twenty-five years before taking emeritus status as a full professor in 1996.

==Public key cryptography==
Hellman and Whitfield Diffie&#x27;s paper &quot;New Directions in Cryptography&quot; was published in 1976. It introduced a radically new method of distributing cryptographic keys, which went far toward solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography, key distribution. It has become known as Diffie–Hellman key exchange, although Hellman has argued that it ought to be called Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange because of Merkle&#x27;s separate contribution. The article stimulated the development of a new class of encryption algorithms, known variously as public key encryption and asymmetric encryption. Hellman and Diffie were awarded the Marconi Fellowship and accompanying prize in 2000 for work on public-key cryptography and for helping make cryptography a legitimate area of academic research, and they were awarded the 2015 Turing Award for the same work.

==Computer privacy debate==
Hellman has been a longtime contributor to the computer privacy debate. He and Diffie were the most prominent critics of the short key size of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in 1975. An audio recording survives of their review of DES at Stanford in 1976 with Dennis Branstad of NBS and representatives of the National Security Agency. Their concern was well-founded: subsequent history has shown not only that NSA actively intervened with IBM and NBS to shorten the key size, but also that the short key size enabled exactly the kind of massively parallel key crackers that Hellman and Diffie sketched out. In response to RSA Security&#x27;s DES Challenges starting in 1997, brute force crackers were built that could break DES, making it clear that DES was insecure and obsolete. As of 2012, a $10,000 commercially available machine could recover a DES key in days.

Hellman also served (1994–96) on the National Research Council&#x27;s Committee to Study National Cryptographic Policy, whose main recommendations have since been implemented.

==International security==
Hellman has been active in researching international security since 1985.

===Beyond War===
Hellman was involved in the original Beyond War movement, serving as the principal editor for the &quot;BEYOND WAR: A New Way of Thinking&quot; booklet.

===Breakthrough===
In 1987 more than 30 scholars came together to produce Russian and English editions of the book &quot;Breakthrough: Emerging New Thinking, Soviet and Western Scholars Issue a Challenge to Build a World Beyond War&quot;. Anatoly Gromyko and Martin Hellman served as the chief editors. The authors of the book examine questions such as: How can we overcome the inexorable forces leading toward a clash between the United States and the Soviet Union? How do we build a common vision for the future? How can we restructure our thinking to synchronize with the imperative of our modern world?

===Defusing the nuclear threat===

Hellman&#x27;s current project in international security is to defuse the nuclear threat. In particular, he is studying the probabilities and risks associated with nuclear weapons and encouraging further international research in this area. His website NuclearRisk.org has been endorsed by a number of prominent individuals, including a former director of the National Security Agency, Stanford&#x27;s President Emeritus, and two Nobel Laureates.

Hellman is a member of the Board of Directors for Daisy Alliance, a non-governmental organization based in Atlanta, Georgia, seeking global security through nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament.

==Awards and honors==
In 1980, Martin Hellman was elevated to the grade of IEEE fellow for contribution to cryptography.
In 1997 he was awarded The Franklin Institute&#x27;s Louis E. Levy Medal, in 1981 the IEEE Donald G. Fink Prize Paper Award (together with Whitfield Diffie), in 2000, he won the Marconi Prize for his invention of public-key cryptography to protect privacy on the Internet, also together with Whit Diffie. In 1998, Hellman was a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society, and in 2010 the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal.

In 2011, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Also in 2011, Hellman was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for his work, with Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, on public key cryptography.

Hellman won the Turing Award for 2015 together with Whitfield Diffie. The Turing award is widely considered the most prestigious award in the field of computer science. The citation for the award was: &quot;&quot;For fundamental contributions to modern cryptography. Diffie and Hellman&#x27;s groundbreaking 1976 paper, &quot;New Directions in Cryptography,&quot; introduced the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which are the foundation for most regularly-used security protocols on the internet today.&quot;&quot;

*Oral history interview with Martin Hellman Oral history interview 2004, Palo Alto, California. Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Hellman describes his invention of public key cryptography with collaborators Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle at Stanford University in the mid-1970s. He also relates his subsequent work in cryptography with Steve Pohlig (the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm) and others. Hellman addresses the National Security Agency’s (NSA) early efforts to contain and discourage academic work in the field, the Department of Commerce’s encryption export restrictions (under the International Traffic of Arms Regulation, or ITAR), and key escrow (the so-called Clipper chip). He also touches on the commercialization of cryptography with RSA Data Security and VeriSign.

<doc id="422415" wikidata="Q5336402" url="?curid=422415" title="Eddie Perez (politician)">
<text>Eduardo Alberto &quot;Eddie&quot; Perez (born 1957) is an American politician who served as the 65th mayor of Hartford, Connecticut, from 2001 to 2010. Prior to entering politics, Perez worked as a community organizer. Perez served as the first mayor who was also the CEO of the city, a setup known as a Strong Mayor.

Perez was recognized in 2001 for his willingness to challenge the entrenched Hartford political machine and form a multi-party coalition focused on reforming the city government.

In 2017 he pleaded guilty to receiving bribes and criminal attempts to commit larceny in the first degree via extortion, both of which are felonies.

==Youth and early career==
Eddie Alberto Pérez was born in 1957 in Corozal, Puerto Rico, where he spent much of his childhood. In 1969 the Pérez family moved with Eddie and his eight siblings to Hartford, Connecticut, which at the time had a growing Puerto Rican community. The family moved 14 times between the Clay Arsenal and Frog Hollow neighborhoods while Perez was growing up. During his youth, he was a member of the Ghetto Brothers gang. Perez graduated from Hartford Public High School and holds an associate degree from Capital Community College and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Economics from Trinity College (Connecticut).

Beginning in 1979 as a Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) volunteer, Perez founded Organized Northeasterners/Clay Hill and North End Inc. (ONE/CHANE), a grassroots neighborhood organization dedicated to improving the housing and economic conditions in North Hartford. He then joined Make Something Happen, a program in Hartford&#x27;s Stowe Village, as its director for two years.

In 1990, Perez became director of community and government relations at Trinity College. In 1999, Perez became the president of the Southside Institutions Neighborhood Alliance, an organization sponsored by Trinity College and Hartford Hospital. As SINA&#x27;s president, Perez was instrumental in the foundation and implementation of the $110 million Learning Corridor complex.

==Term as mayor==
In his first run for political office in 2001, Eddie Pérez made history as the first Hispanic American to become mayor of a New England capital. A native of Puerto Rico, Pérez also broke new political ground by forging a bipartisan coalition of community activists and corporate leaders that contributed to his landslide victory. Elected on a platform of administrative reform, educational improvement, and housing development, Pérez received seventy-five percent of the vote on election day. Pérez credited grassroots support for giving him the victory. He also pointed to the reinvigorated sense of citizenship that his campaign had generated in Hartford&#x27;s Hispanic community. &quot;There was no sense of building social, economic, and cultural capital as Americans, &quot;he told the New York Times shortly after his election, &quot;We have to begin to rebuild that foundation.&quot;

Perez, a Democrat, was re-elected in 2003 in a landslide victory and again in 2007. In 2007 an Editorial in the Hartford Courant credited Perez with helping to reform the Hartford public school system, reduce crime, increase the city&#x27;s historically low homeownership rate, increase the number residents with access to high-speed internet and spark economic development.

Perez gained a reputation for pushing forward urban redevelopment in both the central business district and neighborhoods of the city. At the same time, he worked with grass-roots unions such as UNITE HERE to make sure jobs at new developments went to city residents. Mayor Perez resigned from the office following his conviction on corruption charges in 2010.

=== Corruption cases ===
Perez was arrested in 2009 and convicted in 2010 on charges related to a failed development deal and work done by a city contractor on his house. It was alleged that Perez took part in two separate corrupt schemes, in the first one he was accused of accepting bribes from a city contractor (primarily discounted home renovation) in return for protecting the contractor from the consequences of shoddy work they had done for the city. The second case involved attempted larceny by extortion; it was alleged that Perez tried to coerce a Hartford businessman into paying a bribe to a friendly politician. Even after his conviction Perez claimed that he was innocent and vowed to appeal the conviction. Some, at the time of the Perez investigation, wondered if there was a connection between the Governor&#x27;s Chief of Staff, the Chief State&#x27;s Attorney and the investigation of Perez, a political opponent of the Governor.

On December 9, 2013, a ruling the Connecticut Appellate Court vacated Perez&#x27;s sentence. The court found the trial judge abused her discretion by trying two unrelated cases at the same time, which violated Perez&#x27;s Constitutional right to a fair trial. However, they did not rule that he could not still be tried for both crimes separately. On July 14, 2016, the Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the December 2013 decision of the Connecticut Appellate Court overturning Pérez&#x27;s conviction on charges of bribery, fabricating evidence, and conspiracy to fabricate evidence in connection with the failed development of a vacant site, and improvements to his home by a city contractor, and vacated his sentence.

After the Appellate Court decision Perez was re-indicted on the charges but this time split into two separate cases. In 2017 Perez pleaded guilty to avoid facing two lengthy and expensive trials with little chance of success (his previous conviction only being thrown out on a technicality). He pleaded guilty to receiving bribes related to the corrupt contractor case and criminal attempt to commit larceny in the first degree by extortion related to the extortion case. He was sentenced to an 8-year suspended prison sentence and given a conditional discharge.

In March 2019 Perez was stripped of his state pension because of the severity of his crimes. His legal team made the argument that while he had indeed committed the crimes in question there was no direct financial harm to the city, an argument which was disputed by the prosecution and found wanting by the Judge. The Judge stated that “The severity of the crimes, the self-dealing and disdain for the public good demonstrated by his conduct, as well as the high degree of public trust reposed in the defendant, outweigh any factors mitigating his crimes.”

==Activities since leaving office==
Since leaving office Perez has served as a consultant for non-profits. In 2013, along with two partners, Perez opened an insurance firm on Park Street in Hartford. The firm closed soon thereafter.

Since 2015 he has been employed as a transportation coordinator for the Capitol Region Education Council with a salary of $47,034 per year.

=== 2019 mayoral run ===

On April 4, 2019, Perez announced he was once again running to be Mayor of Hartford. In his announcement speech at the Arch Street Tavern he took responsibility for his past misdeeds and addressed the voters saying &quot;I ask for your forgiveness. I ask the city to give me a second chance.&quot;

Perez lost the Democratic primary to incumbent Bronin and unsuccessfully challenged Bronin in the general election as an independent.

<doc id="422419" wikidata="Q244172" url="?curid=422419" title="Pygmy killer whale">
<text>The pygmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata) is a poorly known and rarely seen oceanic dolphin. It is the only species in the genus Feresa. It derives its common name from sharing some physical characteristics with the orca, also known as the killer whale. It is the smallest cetacean species that has the word &quot;whale&quot; in its common name. Although the species has been known to be extremely aggressive in captivity, this aggressive behavior has not been observed in the wild.

The species had been described by John Gray in 1874, based on two skulls identified in 1827 and 1874. The next recorded sighting was in 1952 which led to its formal naming by Japanese cetologist Munesato Yamada in 1954.

==Description==
=== Distinguishing features ===

The pygmy killer whale is dark gray to black on the cape and has a sharp change to lighter gray on the sides. The flesh around their lips and on the end of their snout is white while pinkish white skin surrounds the genitals. The average length is just over two meters (6.5 ft.). Upon reaching 2 meters in length, males are considered sexually mature. They have approximately 48 teeth, with 22 teeth on the top jaw and 26 on the lower jaw.

They travel approximately 3 km/hour (2 miles/hour) and are predominately found in deeper waters ranging from 500 m to 2000 m (1600–6500 ft.) in depth.

Pygmy killer whales are most commonly confused with melon-headed whales and false killer whales. For instance, a published paper describing an encounter with a school of pygmy killer whales was later determined to be either a mixture of pygmy and false killer whales or solely false killer whales.

The three species can be differentiated by physical differences between them. One defining difference is, although both species have white around the mouth, on pygmy killer whales the white extends back onto the face. Pygmy killer whales also have rounded-tipped dorsal fins, as opposed to pointed tips. When compared to false killer whales, pygmy killer whales have a larger dorsal fin. Finally, pygmy killer whales have a more clearly defined line where the dark dorsal color changes to the lighter lateral color than either of the other two species.

Behavioral differences can also be used to differentiate pygmy killer whales from false killer whales. Pygmy killer whales usually move slowly when at the surface whereas false killer whales are highly energetic. Pygmy killer whales rarely bow ride but it is common in false killer whales.

The small size of this species also causes confusion with other dolphins especially where the frontal head shape of the animals encountered remains unseen. Unlike the melon-headed whale, pygmy killer whales do not normally lift the full face above the water as they surface to breathe so it is not easy to confirm the lack of a bottle. Furthermore, in calmer waters the small bow wave pushed in front of the face looks like a bottle from a distance.

=== Early records ===
Prior to the 1950s, the only record of pygmy killer whales was from two skulls identified in 1827 and 1874. In 1952, a specimen was caught and killed in Taiji, Japan which is known for its annual dolphin hunts. Six years later, in 1958, an individual was killed off the coast of Senegal. In 1963, there were two recorded events involving pygmy killer whales. The first was in Japan, where 14 individuals were caught and brought into captivity; all 14 animals were dead within 22 days. The second was off the coast of Hawaii where an individual animal was caught and successfully brought into captivity. In 1967, a single pygmy killer whale off of Costa Rica died after becoming entangled in a purse seine net. Finally, in 1969, a pygmy killer whale was killed off the coast of St. Vincent and a group of individuals was recorded in the Indian Ocean.

== Echolocation and hearing ==

Like other oceanic dolphins, pygmy killer whales use echolocation. The centroid of echolocation frequencies is between 70–85 kHz and can range from 32 to 100 kHz. This is similar to the range of other odontocetes such as the bottlenose dolphin but is slightly higher than false killer whales. While echolocating, they produce 8-20 clicks per second with a 197-223 decibel sound level at the production source. The linear directionality of sound production in pygmy killer whales is better than in porpoises but lower than is found in bottlenose dolphins; higher directionality results in sounds that are easier to discern from background noise. Based on similarities to the acoustic parameters of other odontocetes, it is presumed that they use a similar mechanism for producing echolocation clicks.

The anatomy for auditory reception is similar to other odontocetes, with a hollow mandible and a mandibular fat body composed of a low density outer layer and a denser inner core. The inner core comes into direct contact with the tympanoperiotic complex (functionally similar to the auditory bulla in other species - see Cetacea). Hearing tests performed on two live individuals brought in for rehabilitation exhibited frequency response range and temporal resolution similar to that found in other echolocating dolphins. During those tests, one individual exhibited low frequency hearing loss that might have been related to treatment with the antibiotic amikacin although the researchers believed the more likely cause was slight differences in testing setup.

==Population and distribution==
Pygmy killer whales have been observed in groups ranging from 4 to 30 or more individual animals. The only population estimate is of 38,900 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean; however, this estimate had a large coefficient of variation meaning the true population size could be much lower or much higher.

The species has a wide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. They are sighted regularly off Hawaii and Japan. Appearances in bycatch suggest a year-round presence in the Indian Ocean near Sri Lanka and the Lesser Antilles. The species has also been found in the south-west Indian Ocean in the French Southern and Antarctic Lands off Europa Island, Mozambique and South Africa but not yet recorded off East Africa. In the Atlantic, individuals have been observed as far north as South Carolina on the west and Senegal on the east. In May 2023, a sailor named Bryant Irawan, spotted a pod much further north off the coast of Portugal, which was confirmed by scientists at happywhale.com. They have been observed along the coast of South America and as far north as the Gulf of Mexico where they have been known to breed during the spring season.

A resident population of pygmy killer whales lives in the waters around Hawaii. Most sightings have been around the main island, however there are occasional sightings around several of the other islands. The population has a tightly connected social structure with affiliations between individuals that can last up to 15 years. Despite the existence of this resident population, sightings of pygmy killer whales around Hawaii are still quite rare; they accounted for less than 1.5% of all cetaceans sighted in a study lasting from 1985 to 2007. This population has been observed associating with false killer whales, short-finned pilot whales, and bottlenose dolphins.

Pygmy killer whales are not commonly reported to be found in Thailand. On August 3, 2024, three pygmy killer whales were found stranded in the mangroves of Ao Kung, Phuket. Local officials were able to safely rescue them and return them to the sea. This is the first time they have been found in Thailand.

==Conservation==
Pygmy killer whales have been incidental bycatch in fishing operations. They represent as much as 4% of the cetacean bycatch in drift gill nets used by commercial fisheries in Sri Lanka.

Like other cetaceans, they are hosts to parasitic worms such as cestodes and nematodes. The cestode species, &quot;Trigonocotyle sexitesticulae,&quot; was first discovered in the corpse of a pygmy killer whale. A pygmy killer whale found stranded on the coast of New Caledonia died from parasitic encephalitis caused by nematodes. They are also victims of opportunistic cookie cutter sharks.

Pygmy killer whales are occasionally involved in mass strandings. As seen in other cetaceans, these strandings often involve a sick or injured individual; even when pushed back out to the sea by rescuers, the healthy individuals will often strand again and refuse to leave until the death of the individual in declining health.

The pygmy killer whale is classified as least concern by the IUCN. They are covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

<text>Israeli MIA are members of the Israel Defense Forces who are missing in action. Despite efforts to locate and repatriate them, their whereabouts remain unknown. Every year, a state ceremony is held at Mount Herzl, Israel&#x27;s military cemetery in Jerusalem.

==IDF prisoners of war==

In the Yom Kippur War 301 Israelis were captured by Syria and Egypt, 232 of whom by the Egyptians, 65 by the Syrians and 4 by the Lebanese. The majority of them were captured in the first stage of that war. Some Israeli soldiers reported after their release about the difficult conditions they faced: they were severely beaten by their captors, sometimes making them unconscious, while many reported that they were being investigated under torture.

===Known Israeli MIAs===
* Members of the 362th battalion declared missing after the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in Lebanon on June 12, 1982: Zechariah Baumel (body recovered in 2019), Tzvi Feldman, and Yehuda Katz.
* Ron Arad, an IDF F-4 Phantom II navigator, was lost over Lebanon on October 16, 1986.
* Guy Hever disappeared on duty in the Golan Heights on August 17, 1997.

==Procedure and guidelines==
According to Reuben Yardor, a military intelligence leader of the Yom Kippur War, the automatic assumption they made was that all that&#x27;s known to their captured soldiers is also known to the captors.

Several publicized stories of Israeli prisoners of war were:

* Corporal Uri Ilan, undercover soldier in the Golani Brigade who committed suicide in a Syrian prison in 1955, leaving a note in which he wrote, &quot;I did not betray.&quot;
* Lieutenant Colonel Avi Nir, fighter pilot shot down and captured during the Yom Kippur War, died in captivity without revealing secrets to his captors. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Courage, for &quot;[He] was tortured to death by investigators but revealed no information. Doing so demonstrates loyalty and supreme sacrifice.&quot;
* Lieutenant Amos Levinberg, intelligence officer taken captive by the Syrians in the beginning the Yom Kippur War, and gave his captors a lot of information. He was eventually released in a prisoner exchange.

<text>The Memoirs of Eminent Monks (), also known as the Biographies of Eminent Monks, is a compilation of biographies of monks in China by Hui Jiao 慧皎 of Jiaxiang Temple in Kuaiji Mountain, Zhejiang from the introduction of Buddhism to China up to the Liang Dynasty. Hui Jiao explains himself that the title is supposed to draw a contrast with monks who are famous but not eminent - an allusion to the lost work of his contemporary Baochang, &quot;Míngsēng zhuàn&quot; 名僧傳 (= Biographies of Famous Monks).

The manuscript is 14 scrolls in length with the preface given in Scroll 14. It contains 257 major biographies, arranged in ten categories: (1) translators of scripture/ sutras 譯經 (yijing), (2) expounders of righteousness 義解 (yijie), (3) monks of miraculous spirit 神異 (shenyi), (4) practitioners of meditation 習禪 (xichan), (5) experts in the vinaya 明律 (minglu), (6) those who give up their bodies 遺身 (yishen), (7) chanters of scripture/ sutras 誦經 (songjing), (8) those bringing happiness and fortune 興福(xingfu), (9) masters of scripture/ sutras 經師 (jingshi), and (10) leaders of chanting 唱導(changdao). Hui Jiao also lists 259 minor biographies. The text includes the biographies of An Shi Gao, Kumārajīva, Faxian, Dao An, Fotudeng, and others. Hui Jiao used a wide range of other biographies, some of which are still extant, and this makes the way he shaped his stories highly revealing of his historical method and ideals.

<text>Johnson Family Vacation is a 2004 American road comedy film directed by Christopher Erskin in his directorial debut. It stars Cedric the Entertainer, Vanessa Williams, Bow Wow, Gabby Soleil, Shannon Elizabeth, Solange Knowles, and Steve Harvey. The story revolves around the Johnson family going on a road trip to attend a family reunion in Missouri and the numerous hijinks that occur along the way. It marks the feature film debut of Jason Momoa. A sequel, titled &quot;Johnson Family Celebration&quot;, is in development.

==Plot==
Nate Johnson and his son, DJ, visit an auto body shop in Los Angeles to pick up the former’s Lincoln Navigator, only to discover that it has been mistakenly upgraded with extravagant features. Despite Nate&#x27;s objections, they are forced to take the customized truck because they have a family reunion to attend in Missouri. On their way home, Nate receives a call from his disapproving mother, Glorietta, who criticizes his marriage to his wife, Dorothy. His older brother, Mack, takes over the call, always trying to one-up Nate by appealing to their mother&#x27;s material desires.

Upon arriving home, it is revealed that Nate and Dorothy are separated, living in separate houses down the street from each other, along with their daughters, Nikki and Destiny. Nikki is preoccupied with her cell phone, while Destiny struggles to retrieve her belongings for her imaginary dog, Sir Barks-a-Lot. Nate disapproves of Dorothy&#x27;s studying and brings it up when he sees her bringing schoolwork on the road trip. Just as they are about to leave, a man named Stan Turner arrives, claiming to have a reservation for a date with Dorothy. Nate intervenes, asserting his role as Dorothy&#x27;s husband and scaring Stan away.

The family sets off on their road trip, but soon after, they encounter a dangerous situation on a stretch of highway, with a semi truck attempting to run them off the road. Nate manages to avoid a collision, but the impact causes their suitcases to spill out of the vehicle. Everyone is visibly shaken, but they eventually find a hotel to rest. Dorothy pretends to be interested in reconciling with Nate, but her true motive is to take a break from the trip.

Tensions arise when Nate stops at an Indian casino, mistakenly thinking it is an Indian reservation. Nikki flirts with an Indian tour guide, causing Nate&#x27;s disapproval. In response, Nate embarrasses Nikki, leading to an argument where he confiscates her cell phone as a punishment.

While on the road, they pick up a hitchhiker named Christelle, against Dorothy&#x27;s better judgment. Chrishelle steals from Destiny and inadvertently leaves a drug pipe in the backseat. At Bun World for Destiny&#x27;s birthday celebration, Chrishelle behaves strangely, frightening the family. They decide to distance themselves from her and continue the journey.

During their stay at another hotel, Nate and DJ find an alligator named Twinkie in their bed, brought in by Chrishelle. They quickly rid themselves of her and resume their journey. DJ eventually needs to relieve himself and urinates in a soda cup, which Nate later throws out of the window, accidentally hitting a police officer on a motorcycle. Nate&#x27;s inattentiveness leads to a collision with a cement truck, covering the truck in wet cement.

Arrested for littering and possession of drugs (Chrishelle&#x27;s pipe), the family finds themselves locked up. Dorothy manages to help the officer with his taxes, securing their release. Back on the road, they run out of gas and Nate calls his Uncle Earl for assistance. Earl flirts with Dorothy and attempts to fix the truck using unconventional tools. Eventually, he hauls the truck onto his own and drives them to the family reunion.

At the reunion, Nate&#x27;s mother criticizes his marriage in front of everyone. However, Dorothy surprises everyone by suggesting they renew their vows. They passionately kiss, and Nate&#x27;s mother acknowledges Dorothy&#x27;s worth as a wife. During the festivities, Nate and his family compete with Mack&#x27;s family for the &quot;Family of the Year&quot; trophy. Nate&#x27;s family wins with an entertaining performance that includes stealing items for their costumes. Stan, who is revealed to be the semi-truck driver, interrupts the celebration and reveals Nate and Dorothy&#x27;s separation to the whole family. Nate confesses his shortcomings as a husband, leading to an apology from himself and Glorietta punching Stan. The family decides to leave and head home, as Dorothy has a test.

They head to Earl&#x27;s auto shop, where to their surprise, Earl has repaired their truck. Upon arriving home in Los Angeles however, the truck immediately falls apart as soon as Nate locks it. Despite the setback, Dorothy reassures Nate, hinting at rekindling their romance. With a smile, Nate follows Dorothy into the house, ready for the next chapter of their relationship.

==Cast==
==Reception==
&quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot; was panned by critics. It received a approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews, with an average score of . The critical consensus says: &quot;The poorly crafted &quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot; squanders its talented cast in a bland family road comedy that draws unfavorable comparisons to Chevy Chase&#x27;s Vacation movies.&quot; The film has a 29 out of 100 rating on Metacritic based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. The critics gave it a &quot;C−&quot; rating at Yahoo! Movies.

Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; criticized the film for being &quot;stitched together with regional stereotypes and gags lifted from other movies&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Marjorie Baumgarten found the humor &quot;half-baked – all setups with few satisfactory payoffs&quot; and the filmmakers&#x27; talents lacking in making new and creative comedy set pieces, concluding that &quot;&quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot; is as arduous to watch as your neighbor&#x27;s poorly focused vacation slides.&quot; Roger Ebert felt that Cedric&#x27;s talents were watered down by the film&#x27;s &quot;paint-by-numbers&quot; script and Erskin&#x27;s direction having &quot;style without zing&quot;, calling it &quot;a routine cross-country comedy that feels exactly like a series of adventures recycled out of every other cross-country comedy.&quot; Andy Patrizio of &quot;IGN&quot; commended Cedric&#x27;s comedic chemistry alongside Harvey and Williams but felt he didn&#x27;t work with Shannon&#x27;s miscast role and the film overall getting bogged down by &quot;a few cases of bathroom humor,&quot; concluding that, &quot;[W]hile in the spirit of &quot;Vacation&quot;, it&#x27;s not quite on its level. But that shouldn&#x27;t stop anyone from checking it out on a slow night. I wouldn&#x27;t make it a top priority rental, but don&#x27;t dismiss it, either. &quot;

<doc id="422431" wikidata="Q914260" url="?curid=422431" title="Felucca">
<text>A felucca is a traditional wooden sailing boat with a single sail used in the Mediterranean, including around Malta and Tunisia. However, in Egypt, Iraq and Sudan (particularly along the Nile and in the Sudanese protected areas of the Red Sea), its rig can consist of two lateen sails as well as just one.

They are usually able to board ten passengers and the crew consists of two or three people.

Contemporary accounts assert that in the summer of 1610, a felucca was the last boat on which Italian painter Caravaggio traveled from Naples, then under Spanish control, to Palo, Italy whereafter he died in Porto Ercole.

==Egypt==
Despite the availability of motorboats and ferries, feluccas are still in active use as a means of transport in Nile-adjacent cities like Aswan or Luxor. They are especially popular among tourists who can enjoy a quieter and calmer mood than motorboats have to offer.

Feluccas were photographed by writer Göran Schildt&#x27;s travels on the Nile in 1954–55 as part of his Mediterranean sea travels. Schildt documented them as being called &quot;Ajasor&quot;.

==San Francisco==
A large fleet of lateen-rigged feluccas thronged San Francisco&#x27;s docks before and after the construction, at the foot of Union Street, of the state-owned Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf in 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;maritime/tides-of-change&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Light, small, and maneuverable, the feluccas were the mainstay of the fishing fleet of San Francisco Bay. John C. Muir, Curator of Small Craft,&lt;ref name=&quot;friendsofchinacamp/team&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SF Maritime Historical Park, said of them, &quot;These workhorses featured a mast that angled, or raked, forward sharply, and a large triangular sail hanging down from a long, two-piece yard&quot;. Among the owners of feluccas in San Francisco Bay was the author Jack London, who recollected his adventure as a young oyster pirate in his works.

<text>Market Bosworth ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Leicestershire, England. At the 2001 Census, it had a population of 1,906, increasing to 2,097 at the 2011 census. It is most famously near to the site of the decisive final battle of the Wars of the Roses.

In 1974, Market Bosworth Rural District merged with Hinckley Rural District to form the district of Hinckley and Bosworth.

==History==
Building work here and at other sites has revealed evidence of a settlement on the hill since the Bronze Age. Remains of a Roman villa have been found on the east side of Barton Road. Bosworth as an Anglo-Saxon village dates from the 8th century.

Before the Norman Conquest of 1066, there were two manors at Bosworth, one belonging to an Anglo-Saxon knight named Fernot, and some sokemen. Following the Norman conquest, as recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, both the Anglo-Saxon manors and the village were part of the lands awarded by William the Conqueror to the Count of Meulan from Normandy, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. Subsequently, the village passed by marriage dowry to the English branching of the French House of Harcourt.

Edward I gave a royal charter to Sir William Harcourt allowing a market to be held every Wednesday. The village took the name Market Bosworth from 12 May 1285 and on this day became a &quot;town&quot; by common definition. The two oldest buildings in Bosworth, St. Peter&#x27;s Church and the Red Lion pub, were built during the 14th century.

The Battle of Bosworth took place to south of the town in 1485 as the final significant battle in the Wars of the Roses between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, which resulted in the death of King Richard III. 

Following the discovery of the remains of Richard III in Leicester during 2012, the funeral cortège for his reburial passed through the town on Sunday 22 March 2015 on its way to Leicester Cathedral. This event is now commemorated with a floor plaque in front of the war memorial in the town square.

In 1509 the manor passed from the Harcourts to the Grey family.
In 1554, following the beheading of Lady Jane Grey, the manor of Bosworth was among lands confiscated in the name of Mary I and her husband Philip II of Spain. They awarded the manor to the Catholic nobleman Edward Hastings. In 1567, his heirs sold it to Sir Wolstan Dixie, Lord Mayor of London, who never lived in Bosworth. 

The first Dixie to live in Bosworth was his grand-nephew, Sir Wolstan Dixie of Appleby Magna, who moved to the town in 1608. He started construction of a manor house and park, as well as establishing the free Dixie Grammar School. The modern Bosworth Hall was the work of Sir Beaumont Dixie, 2nd Baronet (1629–1692).

In 1885 the 11th Baronet &quot;Beau&quot; Dixie was forced to auction Bosworth Hall to pay his gambling debts. It was bought by Lady Agnes Tollemache, whose husband Charles Tollemache Scott enlarged the estate, planted woodlands, and rebuilt the lodges and farms. Lady Agnes&#x27;s daughter sold the estate in 1913.

The War Memorial in the town square honours nineteen local men who died in the First World War, and eleven men who died in the Second World War. The town&#x27;s historic cattle market operated until 1996.

<text>Brondesbury is a station on the Mildmay line of the London Overground. It is situated on a viaduct crossing Kilburn High Road in the Brondesbury area of Kilburn in the London Borough of Brent. It is approximately south-east of station and half a mile north-west of station.

==History==

Brondesbury station opened on 2 January 1860 as &quot;Edgeware Road (Kilburn)&quot; station on the Hampstead Junction Railway.

A signal box was in use at the station until 5 February 1962.

A number of plans were put forward between 1890 and 1926 to build an underground railway along the Edgware Road, and would have seen the construction of a Tube station at Brondesbury. None of the schemes succeeded and no such line was ever built.

==Services==
All services at Brondesbury are operated by London Overground as part of the Mildmay line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to via

==History==
===St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical College and The London Hospital Medical College===

The Medical College of The Royal London Hospital (now part of the School of Medicine and Dentistry) was England&#x27;s first medical school when it opened in 1785.
In 1850, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first fully qualified female doctor in the UK, after training at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital.

===People&#x27;s Palace===
The predecessor to Queen Mary College was founded in the mid-Victorian era as a People&#x27;s Palace when growing awareness of conditions in London&#x27;s East End led to drives to provide facilities for local inhabitants, popularised in the 1882 novel &quot;All Sorts of Conditions of Men – An Impossible Story&quot; by Walter Besant, which told of how a rich and clever couple from Mayfair went to the East End to build a ”Palace of Delight, with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, art and designing schools.&quot; Although not directly responsible for the conception of the People&#x27;s Palace, the novel did much to popularise it.

The trustees of the Beaumont Trust, administering funds left by Barber Beaumont, purchased the site of the former Bancroft&#x27;s School from the Drapers&#x27; Company. On 20 May 1885, the Drapers&#x27; Court of Assistants resolved to grant £20,000 &quot;for the provision of the technical schools of the People&#x27;s Palace.&quot; The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1886, and on 14 May 1887 Queen Victoria opened the palace&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall, as well as laying the foundation stone for the technical schools in the palace&#x27;s east wing.

The technical schools were opened on 5 October 1888, with the entire palace completed by 1892. However, others saw the technical schools as one day becoming a technical university for the East End. In 1892 the Drapers&#x27; Company provided £7,000 a year for ten years to guarantee the educational side income.

===East London College===

In 1895 John Leigh Smeathman Hatton, director of evening classes (1892–1896; later director of studies 1896–1908 and principal 1908–1933), proposed introducing a course of study leading to the Bachelor of Science degree of the University of London. By the start of the 20th century, the first degrees were awarded and Hatton, along with several other professors, were recognised as teachers of the University of London. In 1906 an application for Parliamentary funds &quot;for the aid of Educational Institutions engaged in work of a University nature&quot;, led to the college being admitted on an initial three-year trial basis as a school of the University of London on 15 May 1907 as East London College.
Teaching of aeronautical engineering began in 1907, which led to the first UK aeronautical engineering department being established in 1909, boasting a ground-breaking wind tunnel and creating what became (following the demise of the University of Paris) the oldest aeronautical programme in the world.

In 1910 the college&#x27;s status in the University of London was extended for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915. During this period the organisation of the governors of the People&#x27;s Palace was rearranged, creating the separate People&#x27;s Palace Committee and East London College Committee, both under the Palace Governors, as a sign of the growing separation of the two concepts within a single complex.

During the First World War, the college admitted students from The London Hospital Medical College who were preparing for the preliminary medical examination, the first step in a long process that would eventually bring the two institutions together. After the war, the college grew, albeit constrained by the rest of the People&#x27;s Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east. In 1920 it obtained both the Palace&#x27;s Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The college&#x27;s status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the Board of Education.

In April 1929 the College Council decided it would take the steps towards applying to the Privy Council for a Royal Charter, but on the advice of the Drapers&#x27; Company first devised a scheme for development and expansion, which recommended among other things to re-amalgamate the People&#x27;s Palace and the college, with guaranteed provision of the Queen&#x27;s Hall for recreational purposes, offering at least freedom of governance if not in space.

===Queen Mary College===

In the early hours of 25 February 1931 a fire destroyed the Queen&#x27;s Hall, though both the college and the winter gardens escaped. In the coming days discussions on reconstruction led to the proposal that the entire site be transferred to the college which would then apply for a charter alone. The Drapers&#x27; Company obtained St Helen&#x27;s Terrace, a row of six houses neighbouring the site, and in July 1931 it was agreed to give these over to the People&#x27;s Palace for a new site adjacent to the old, which would now become entirely the domain of the college. Separation was now achieved. The Charter was now pursued, but the Academic Board asked for a name change, feeling that &quot;East London&quot; carried unfortunate associations that would hinder the college and its graduates. With the initial proposed name, &quot;Queen&#x27;s College&quot;, having already been taken by The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford and &quot;Victoria College&quot; felt to be unoriginal, &quot;Queen Mary College&quot; was settled on. The Charter of Incorporation was presented on 12 December 1934 by Queen Mary herself.

====Under the charter====

During the Second World War, the college was evacuated to Cambridge, where it shared with King&#x27;s College. After the war the college returned to London, facing many of the same problems but with prospects for westward expansion. The East End had suffered considerable bomb damage (although the college itself had incurred little) and consequently several areas of land near to the college site now became vacant. New buildings for physics, engineering, biology and chemistry were built on the new sites, whilst the arts took over the space vacated in the original building, now renamed the Queens&#x27; Building.

Limited accommodation resulted in the acquisition of further land in South Woodford (now directly connected to Mile End tube station by means of the Central line&#x27;s eastward extension), upon which tower blocks were established. The college also obtained the Co-operative Wholesale Society&#x27;s clothing factory on the Mile End Road which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Laws (and some other teaching), as well as the former headquarters of Spratt&#x27;s Patent Ltd (operators of the &quot;largest dog biscuit factory in the world&quot; – see Spratt&#x27;s Complex) at 41–47 Bow Road, which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Economics founded by Maurice Peston, Baron Peston. Both faculties were physically separated from what was now a campus to the west.

From the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s the college proposed to link with the London Hospital Medical College and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical College with a joint facility in Mile End. A further link with both The London and St. Bartholomew&#x27;s was made in 1974 when an anonymous donor provided for the establishment of a further hall of residence in Woodford, to be divided equally between Queen Mary College students and the two medical colleges.

At the start of the 1980s changing demographics and finances led to a reorganisation of the University of London. At Queen Mary some subjects, such as Russian and Classics were discontinued, whilst the college became one of five in the university with a concentration of laboratory sciences, including the transfer of science departments from Westfield College, Chelsea College, Queen Elizabeth College and Bedford College.

===1989 to 2010===
In 1989 Queen Mary College (informally known as QMC) merged with Westfield College to form Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College (often abbreviated to QMW). Over subsequent years, activities were concentrated on the Queen Mary site, with the Westfield site eventually sold.

In 1990, The London Hospital was renamed The Royal London Hospital, after marking its 250th year, and a re-organisation of medical education within the University of London resulted in most of the free-standing medical schools being merged with existing large colleges to form multi-faculty institutions. In 1995 The London Hospital Medical College and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical College merged into Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College to form an entity named Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

In 2000 the college changed its name for general public use to Queen Mary, University of London; in 2013, the college legally changed its name to Queen Mary University of London.

The VISTA telescope is a 4-metre class wide-field telescope at the Paranal Observatory in Chile that was conceived and developed by a consortium of UK universities led by Queen Mary University, costing approximately £36m.

The Westfield Student Village opened in 2004 on the Mile End Campus, bringing over 2,000 rooms to students and a huge array of facilities, restaurants, and cafes.

The Blizard Building, home to the Medical School&#x27;s Institute of Cell and Molecular Science opened at the Whitechapel campus in 2005. The award-winning building was designed by Will Alsop, and is named after William Blizard, an English surgeon and founder of The London Hospital Medical College in 1785.

The year 2006 saw the refurbishment of The Octagon, the original library of the People&#x27;s Palace dating back to 1888.

In 2007 parts of the School of Law – postgraduate facilities and the Centre for Commercial Law Studies – moved to premises in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in central London. The Women at Queen Mary Exhibition was staged in the Octagon, marking 125 years of Westfield College and 120 years of Queen Mary College.

In September 2009, the world&#x27;s first science education centre located within a working research laboratory opened at the Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, hoping to inspire children with school tours and interactive games and puzzles.

===2010 to present===
Queen Mary became one of the few university-level institutions to implement a requirement of the A* grade at A-Level after its introduction in 2010 on some of their most popular courses, such as Engineering, Law, and Medicine.

Following on from the 2010 UK student protests, Queen Mary set fees of £9,000 per year for September 2012 entry, while also offering bursaries and scholarships.

On 12 March 2012 it was announced that Queen Mary would be joining the Russell Group in August 2012. Later in March, Queen Mary and the University of Warwick announced the creation of a strategic partnership, including research collaboration, joint teaching of English, history and computer science undergraduates, and the creation of eight joint post-doctoral research fellowships.

In January 2013, Queen Mary established the world&#x27;s first professorial chair in animal replacement science.

From 2014, Queen Mary began awarding its own degrees, rather than those of the University of London.

Queen Mary became the first Russell Group university to offer Degree Apprenticeships and three years later was the first UK university to launch a social change degree, the BSc in Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship.

In 2021, Queen Mary became the first UK university to receive the Platinum-level Engage Watermark from the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement.

==Campuses==

The main Mile End campus contains the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science and Engineering, the Queens&#x27; Building, the main college library, the student union, Draper&#x27;s bar and club, several restaurants, a number of halls of residences and a gym. The educational and research sites of the Arts Research Centre, Computer Science, the large Engineering building, G.E. Fogg Building, Francis Bancroft Building, G. O. Jones Building, Joseph Priestley Building, Lock-keeper&#x27;s Graduate Centre, and the Mathematical Science Building, are all located within the Mile End campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;student guide 2011/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grade II listed Queens&#x27; Building is home to the Octagon. Built in 1887, the Octagon was originally the Queen Mary University of London library. It was designed by architect ER Robson and inspired by the British Museum Reading Room. In 2006, &quot;brightly coloured leather bound books&quot; were restored and reinstated to the bookshelves, along with &quot;busts of famous literati looking down from the beautiful high domed ceiling.&quot;

The People&#x27;s Palace is home to the Grade II listed art deco style Great Hall; this has a seating capacity of over 700 and standing of 1,000. It is complemented by 3 lecture theatres and a foyer. The night the votes were counted for the 1945 general election, the then local MP for Limehouse and Leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee, was present at The People&#x27;s Palace, where he learned the final result and received confirmation that he had become Prime Minister. A statue of Attlee that was originally displayed outside Limehouse Library was, after its restoration, unveiled outside the Queen Mary library by Peter Mandelson in April 2011.

The Whitechapel campus encompasses Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, the Whitechapel Medical Library, the award-winning Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, and The Royal London Hospital.

The West Smithfield campus of the School of Medicine and Dentistry, the West Smithfield Medical Library, the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, the John Vane Science Centre, the Heart Centre and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital are based in Smithfield.

The Centre for Commercial Law Studies and LLM teaching and postgraduate law research activities are based in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in Holborn.

The Malta campus, situated on the island of Gozo, is part of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. Students taught at the Malta campus are offered the same curriculum as taught in London, for the MBBS Medicine and Medicine Foundation programmes.

===Harold Pinter Drama Studio===
The Harold Pinter Drama Studio is the main teaching and performance space of the students and staff of the Department of Drama. On 26 April 2005, Harold Pinter, who was to win the Nobel Prize in Literature later that year, gave a public reading and was interviewed by his official authorised biographer, Michael Billington, in the studio named for Pinter and located as part of the Faculty of Arts (Department of Drama, School of English and Drama) in the Mile End campus, to celebrate its refurbishment.

==Organisation and administration==
Queen Mary and Westfield College was established by Act of Parliament and the granting of a Royal charter in 1989, following the merger of Queen Mary College (incorporated by charter in 1934) and Westfield College (incorporated in 1933). The Charter has subsequently been revised three times: in 1995 (as a result of the merger of the college with the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry); in 2008 (as a result of the Privy Council awarding the College Degree Awarding Powers; and in July 2010 (following a governance review).

== Equality, diversity and inclusion ==

Students from more than 170 nationalities attend Queen Mary, approximately 41% of them from overseas. According to &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; Good University Guide, in 2021–2, 77% of Queen Mary students came from a black or ethnic minority background; this is the highest proportion of any university in the Russell Group and in the top 5 of any UK institution of higher education. &quot;The Times&quot; also cites QM as having one of the narrowest (i.e. best) black achievement gaps among UK institutions.

In 2008, in recognition of the institution&#x27;s commitment to advancing gender equality and diversity, the university achieved an Athena SWAN bronze award. This was elevated to a silver award in 2017, and the accreditation was renewed in 2022.

In 2019, the Queen Mary&#x27;s Diversity and Inclusion Manager resigned, citing a &quot;tick-box mentality&quot; to equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as a &quot;toxic&quot; working environment that prioritised accolades over meaningful improvement; the departing manager further declared that Queen Mary was &quot;institutionally racist.&quot; Other academics have raised grievances regarding incidents of racism. In January 2020, a former lecturer who had brought the university to an employment tribunal for direct racial and gender discrimination and harassment as a continuing act had her case dismissed on the basis that the alleged incidents had occurred after statutory time limits had expired.

Queen Mary&#x27;s UCU branch established an anti-racism working group in 2020 to “focus attention on institutional racism at Queen Mary University of London, but also to address questions of equality and diversity within the Union itself.”

===QMUL and Leopold II of Belgium===
In 2016, the university authorities removed plaques commemorating two visits by Leopold II of Belgium to the university site in 1887. Leopold, a cousin of Queen Victoria, had no links to Queen Mary other than a visit in April 1887 to Mile End and a subsequent visit in June 1887 to lay the foundation stone of the Octagon library, where the plaques were sited. The brutal and exploitative nature of Leopold&#x27;s rule over the Congo Free State between 1885 and 1908, and his commemoration at Queen Mary, came under renewed scrutiny as of institutional links with colonial repression were re-evaluated in the wake of the global attention paid to the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. However, the suitability of any commemoration of Leopold on university property had been raised as early as 2013. In June 2016, the university&#x27;s Pan-African society launched a petition for the removal of the plaques that celebrated a “genocidal colonialist” and were offensive to students from ethnic minority backgrounds. The society argued that their removal would help those students feel more “welcome, respected and integrated”. By December 2016, the plaques had been removed from public view &quot;as part of ongoing refurbishment work.” This attracted criticism from academics at other institutions who called the decision a &quot;whitewashing&quot; of history that &quot;suggests a fear within the university authorities... of attracting negative attention.&quot;

===UCU Strikes and Snitch Forms===
In 2022, as part of ongoing national strikes by the University and College Union, more than 100 staff at Queen Mary University of London taking part in a national marking boycott were withheld 100% of their wages for 21 days. Several other universities had threatened to dock full pay for action short of a strike, however Queen Mary University of London was the only institution to follow through on the threat. This led to the university being branded the worst university employer in the UK.

In the 2022/23 academic year, while strike action was continuing, the university continued to crack down and became the first university in the UK to implement a &#x27;student snitch form&#x27;. Students were encouraged to report striking staff, with threats of docking 39 days pay for those who did not reschedule missed teaching. Several senior academics resigned from the university in response to this action, citing a lack of trust leading to unbearable working conditions. Throughout this process, students and staff were sent very different messages in email updates by principal Colin Bailey, leading to increased division within the university.

<doc id="422463" wikidata="Q4090718" url="?curid=422463" title="Oliver Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley">
<text>Oliver Ridsdale Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1 March 1899– 10 August 1958), known as Viscount Corvedale from 1937 to 1947, was a British socialist politician who had a career at political odds with his father, the Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin.

Educated at Eton, which he hated, Baldwin left as soon as he could. After serving in the army during the First World War he undertook various jobs, including a brief appointment as an officer in the Armenian army, and wrote journalism and books on a range of topics. He served two terms as a Labour Member of Parliament between 1929 and 1947.

Baldwin never achieved ministerial office in Britain. His last post was as Governor of the Leeward Islands, from 1948 to 1950.

==Early years==
Baldwin was born at his parents&#x27; London home in St Ermin&#x27;s Mansions, St James&#x27;s Park, London, and spent his early childhood in Worcestershire, first at Dunley Hall, near Stourport, Worcestershire, and then at Astley Hall near Stourport, after the Baldwin family moved there in 1902. Baldwin was one of six surviving children, and the elder surviving son of the businessman Stanley Baldwin and his wife Lucy, &quot;née&quot; Ridsdale.

The family-unit was emotionally close, and Baldwin&#x27;s parents loving and supportive, though his father was, like many parents of that class at that time, not closely involved in his children&#x27;s lives. Baldwin senior was elected a Conservative MP in 1908, and rose within fifteen years to become prime minister. He sent his son to Eton College, where the boy failed to fit in. He hated what he saw as the school&#x27;s snobbery and cruelty, and to his teachers he appeared to be &quot;full of silliness, egotism, un-divine discontent, contempt for others (and of course for authority, discipline, tradition etc)&quot;.

His &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry states that he was educated &quot;in football at Eton; in other things, beginning to learn&quot;. He was keen to leave school and join the army to fight in the First World War, and was commissioned from his officer cadet unit as a second lieutenant in the Special Reserve of the Irish Guards on 27 June 1917. He did not join the fighting in France until June 1918, but then distinguished himself by his bravery. He was promoted to lieutenant on 27 December 1918 and relinquished his commission on 1 April 1920. His war service strengthened his idealism and increasingly socialist views.

==Career==

===Post-war and 1920s===
After the war Baldwin served briefly as British Vice-Consul in Boulogne, and then travelled in north Africa. He refused to be supported by his father, and earned a living as a journalist and travel writer. A chance meeting in Alexandria led to an appointment as an infantry instructor in the newly independent Armenia, but soon after he took up the post in 1920 the democratic government collapsed and Baldwin was imprisoned by Bolshevik-backed revolutionaries. He was freed two months later when democracy was restored, but en route back to Britain he was arrested by the Turkish authorities, accused of spying for Soviet Russia. He was held for five months, in grim conditions, with execution a constant threat. He later wrote a book about his experiences, called &quot;Six Prisons and Two Revolutions&quot;. After his release Baldwin returned to Britain.
In 1923, around this time, the leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister Bonar Law retired due to ill health. Baldwin&#x27;s father, Stanley, already Chancellor of the Exchequer, became prime minister in Law&#x27;s place. The younger Baldwin by now considered himself a committed socialist, and shortly after his father&#x27;s elevation, he publicly declared his political beliefs, and broke off contact with his parents, much to their distress. At the 1924 general election Baldwin contested the seat of Dudley for the Labour Party, attracting press comment. He was unsuccessful; but Baldwin Snr, who had been out of power since the 1923 general election, returned to power for a second term as prime minister. Shortly afterwards, the breach between parents and son was patched up. Father and son remained on the warmest personal terms, assisted by agreement to avoid political discussions, and in politics Baldwin refrained from personally attacking his father.

At the 1929 election Baldwin won Dudley, and served as a backbench supporter of Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government. His father had lost the election, but remained an MP, and became Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons; unusually, father and son now sat facing each other across the House of Commons. Baldwin Snr initially found it difficult to bear, telling one of his daughters that he ‘nearly died’ when he first saw Oliver sitting on the opposite benches to himself in the House of Commons, but matters were smoothed over by a letter Baldwin wrote to console his father: &quot;Wherever I have gone on my political rounds during the past six years I have never heard any of our supporters speak other than in a kindly way of your personal self… To you, who have generally been victorious, the results may disappoint you, but take it from one who, until the other day, has always been on the losing side, always in the minority and generally alone, that victory or defeat are both flatterers and as such are of no serious consequence.&quot;

Like other young left-wing Labour MPs, Baldwin was critical of MacDonald&#x27;s insistence on strict financial management and refusal to launch large Keynesian public works programmes. Early in 1931 Baldwin resigned from the Labour Party and was briefly associated with Oswald Mosley&#x27;s New Party, but soon repudiated Mosley and rejoined Labour. When MacDonald formed the National Government, Stanley Baldwin and the Conservatives joined it; most Labour members, including Oliver Baldwin, did not. The 1931 general election resulted in a landslide win for the National Government and a disaster for Labour. Baldwin was among the casualties, defeated by a Conservative candidate, Sir Park Goff, who won by 19,991 votes to Baldwin&#x27;s 10,837 at Chatham. Baldwin returned to journalism. In Walker&#x27;s view, he was better known as a journalist than as a politician, writing anti-fascist articles in the usually pro-appeasement Rothermere press during the 1930s. He also wrote what the reviewer Andrew Lycett calls &quot;a curious novel called &quot;The Coming of Aissa&quot;, which emphasised the socialistic leanings of Jesus within an agnostic, Asian, neoplatonic context.&quot;

===Later years===
Baldwin fought Paisley at the 1935 election, failing to be elected by 389 votes behind the Liberal candidate. In 1937 Stanley Baldwin retired from politics and was created Earl Baldwin of Bewdley. As a result, Oliver Baldwin acquired the courtesy title Viscount Corvedale, which did not entail membership of the House of Lords. In 1939, he rejoined the army, becoming a major in the Intelligence Corps and serving in the Near East and north Africa.

At the 1945 general election, when Labour returned to power under Clement Attlee, Corvedale was elected for Paisley with a majority of 10,330. The Attlee government lacked representation in the House of Lords, which was dominated by Conservative peers. In 1947, Corvedale accepted the prime minister&#x27;s offer of a peerage, but before he could take his seat his father died and Corvedale was automatically elevated as the second Earl Baldwin. Lycett comments that had it not been for the first earl&#x27;s death Baldwin father and son would, uniquely, have sat opposite each other in both houses of parliament.

==== Governor of the Leeward Islands 1948–1950 ====
In February 1948, Baldwin was appointed Governor and Commander in Chief of the Leeward Islands, a British colonial territory in the Caribbean, arriving there a month later.

His male life partner, Boyle, accompanied him, to the disapproval of some of the British establishment in Antigua. There were rumours of &quot;strange and unnatural happenings at Government House&quot; that were reinforced by complaints from naval captains whose crews had been commandeered by the governor for nude bathing sessions.

Partly for this reason, and partly because Baldwin made no secret of his continuing socialist views or his desire for multiracial inclusiveness, he was recalled in 1950.

==Personal life==
In 1922, he was briefly engaged to Dorothea (&quot;Doreen&quot;) Arbuthnot, the daughter of a political ally of his father. Coming to terms with the fact that he was homosexual, Baldwin broke off the engagement, and began a relationship with John &quot;Johnnie&quot; Parke Boyle (30 July 1893 – 24 February 1969), son of Major Charles Boyle, of Great Milton, Oxfordshire. 

Described in &quot;The New Statesman&quot; as &quot;a charming ne&#x27;er-do-well&quot;, Boyle, who was six years older than Baldwin, became his lifelong partner. Boyle and Baldwin set up home together in a farm in Oxfordshire owned by Boyle&#x27;s brother in law, Lord Macclesfield, and living in what the biographer Christopher J Walker describes as &quot;gentle, amicable, animal-loving, primitive, homosexual socialism&quot;. Though the two had to be careful and corresponded in code, they employed good-looking male staff and held weekend parties attended by vetted friends such as Harold Nicolson and Beverley Nichols.

Baldwin&#x27;s family appears to have been accepting of the situation, apart from his father&#x27;s first cousin, Rudyard Kipling, with whom Baldwin had been close, but who broke all contact on hearing of Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;beastliness&quot;. Baldwin Snr, though perhaps not Mrs Baldwin, probably recognised Baldwin and Boyle were a couple. Unusually for the period, both parents accepted Boyle&#x27;s place in Baldwin&#x27;s life. The elder Baldwin&#x27;s letters to Boyle are addressed to &quot;My Dear Johnny&quot;, a mark of favour, while Boyle won Mrs Baldwin over by showing her &quot;in effect, the attentions of a dutiful son-in-law.&quot; During Baldwin Snr&#x27;s time in office, the two elders would occasionally travel from the prime ministerial country retreat of Chequers to visit their son and his partner at their Oxfordshire farmhouse.

== Death ==

Baldwin died in Mile End Hospital, London, in 1958. Being childless, he was succeeded in the earldom and viscountcy by his younger brother Arthur. His ashes are interred on a hilltop on the island of Antigua. The stone inscription reads, &quot;Here lie the ashes of Oliver Ridsdale Second Earl Baldwin of Bewdley, Born March 1899 Died August 1958. Governor, Commander in Chief in and over the Leeward Islands and Vice Admiral of the same 1948 – 1950. He loved the people of these islands. RIP.&quot;

<doc id="422466" wikidata="Q7719275" url="?curid=422466" title="The Book of Merlyn">
<text>The Book of Merlyn is an Arthurian fantasy book by British writer T. H. White. It is the conclusion of &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, but it was published separately and posthumously.

==Plot summary==
The book opens as King Arthur prepares himself for his final battle. Merlyn reappears to complete Arthur&#x27;s education and discover the cause of wars. As he did in &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, Merlyn again demonstrates ethics and politics to Arthur by transforming him into various animals.

The last chapter of the book takes place only hours before the final battle between King Arthur and his son and nephew Mordred. Arthur does not want to fight after everything that he has learned from Merlyn. He makes a deal with Mordred to split England in half. Mordred accepts. During the making of this deal, a snake comes upon one of Mordred&#x27;s soldiers. The soldier draws his sword. The opposing side, unaware of the snake, takes this as an act of betrayal. Arthur&#x27;s troops attack Mordred&#x27;s, and both Arthur and Mordred die in the battle that follows.

Guenever joins a convent, and remains there till death. Lancelot becomes a hermit and dies a hermit. His last miracle was making the room that he died in smell like heaven.

==Concept and creation==
White was inspired to write this book upon determining that the key theme of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; is to find an &quot;antidote for war&quot;. Rather than containing a distinct plot, this book reads more like a discourse on war and human nature.

White had revised &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1938), &quot;The Queen of Air and Darkness&quot; (1939), plus &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; (1940) to weave in the anti-war theme. In November 1941 White sent the revisions along with &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot; (part 4) and &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot; (part 5) to his publisher with the intent that all five parts be published together as a single book. The publisher declined due to wartime paper shortages and White&#x27;s antiwar message.

White salvaged parts of the rejected text by including scenes from &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot; in the revised &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; part of &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; that was published in 1958.

==Rediscovery and publication==
The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin purchased the bulk of White&#x27;s personal papers and manuscripts between 1967 and 1969. In 1975 the original manuscript for &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot; was discovered amongst this collection, and was prepared for publication by the University of Texas Press in 1977, as &quot;The Book of Merlyn: The Unpublished Conclusion to The Once and Future King&quot;, with a prologue by Sylvia Townsend Warner and illustrations by Trevor Stubley.

Groups of motor units often work together as a motor pool to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle. The concept was proposed by Charles Scott Sherrington.

Usually muscle fibers in a motor unit are of the same fiber type. When a motor unit is activated, all of its fibers contract. In vertebrates, the force of a muscle contraction is controlled by the number of activated motor units.

The number of muscle fibers within each unit can vary within a particular muscle and even more from muscle to muscle: the muscles that act on the largest body masses have motor units that contain more muscle fibers, whereas smaller muscles contain fewer muscle fibers in each motor unit. For instance, thigh muscles can have a thousand fibers in each unit, while extraocular muscles might have ten. Muscles which possess more motor units (and thus have greater individual motor neuron innervation) are able to control force output more finely.

Motor units are organized slightly differently in invertebrates: each muscle has few motor units (typically less than 10), and each muscle fiber is innervated by multiple neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Thus, while in vertebrates the force of contraction of muscles is regulated by how many motor units are activated, in invertebrates it is controlled by regulating the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals.

==Recruitment ==
The central nervous system is responsible for the orderly recruitment of motor neurons, beginning with the smallest motor units. Henneman&#x27;s size principle indicates that motor units are recruited from smallest to largest based on the size of the load. For smaller loads requiring less force, slow twitch, low-force, fatigue-resistant muscle fibers are activated prior to the recruitment of the fast twitch, high-force, less fatigue-resistant muscle fibers. Larger motor units are typically composed of faster muscle fibers that generate higher forces.

The central nervous system has two distinct ways of controlling the force produced by a muscle through motor unit recruitment: spatial recruitment and temporal recruitment. Spatial recruitment is the activation of more motor units to produce a greater force. Larger motor units contract along with small motor units until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal motor unit recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the motor unit fibers from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches &quot;fuse&quot; temporally. This produces a greater force than singular contractions by decreasing the interval between stimulations to produce a larger force with the same number of motor units.

Using electromyography (EMG), the neural strategies of muscle activation can be measured. Ramp-force threshold refers to an index of motor neuron size in order to test the size principle. This is tested by determining the recruitment threshold of a motor unit during isometric contraction in which the force is gradually increased. Motor units recruited at low force (low-threshold units) tend to be small motor units, while high-threshold units are recruited when higher forces are needed and involve larger motor neurons. These tend to have shorter contraction times than the smaller units. The number of additional motor units recruited during a given increment of force declines sharply at high levels of voluntary force. This suggests that, even though high threshold units generate more tension, the contribution of recruitment to increase voluntary force declines at higher force levels.

When necessary, the maximal number of motor units in a muscle can be recruited simultaneously, producing the maximum force of contraction for that muscle, but this cannot last for very long because of the energy requirements to sustain the contraction. To prevent complete muscle fatigue, motor units are generally not all simultaneously active, but instead some motor units rest while others are active, which allows for longer muscle contractions. The nervous system uses recruitment as a mechanism to efficiently utilize a skeletal muscle.

To test motor unit stimulation, electrodes are placed extracellularly on the skin and an intramuscular stimulation is applied. After the motor unit is stimulated, its pulse is then recorded by the electrode and displayed as an action potential, known as a motor unit action potential (MUAP). When multiple MUAP’s are recorded within a short time interval, a motor unit action potential train (MUAPT) is then noted. The time in between these pulses is known as the inter-pulse interval (IPI). In medical electrodiagnostic testing for a patient with weakness, careful analysis of the MUAP size, shape, and recruitment pattern can help in distinguishing a myopathy from a neuropathy.

==Motor unit types ==
Motor units are generally categorized based upon the similarities between several factors:
*Physiological
**Contraction speed in Isometric contractions
***Rate of rise of force
***Time to peak of a twitch contraction (response to a single nerve impulse)
****FF — Fast fatigable — high force, fast contraction speed but fatigue in a few seconds.
****FR — Fast fatigue resistant — intermediate force, fatigue resistant — fast contraction speed and resistant to fatigue.
****FI — Fast intermediate — intermediate between FF and FR.
****S or SO — Slow (oxidative) — low force, slower contraction speed, highly fatigue resistant.
*Biochemical
**Histochemical (the oldest form of biochemical fiber typing)
***Glycolytic enzyme activity (e.g. glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD))
***Oxidative enzyme activity (e.g. succinate dehydrogenase -SDH )
***Sensitivity of Myosin ATPase to acid and alkali:
****I (Slow oxidative, SO) — Low glycolytic and high oxidative presence. Low(er) myosin ATPase, sensitive to alkali.
****IIa (Fast oxidative/glycolytic, FOG) — High glycolytic, oxidative and myosin ATPase presence, sensitive to acid.
****IIb (Fast glycolytic, FG) — High glycolytic and myosin ATPase presence, sensitive to acid. Low oxidative presence.
****IIi — fibers intermediate between IIa and IIb. (Histochemical and Physiological types correspond as follows: S and Type I, FR and type IIa, FF and type IIb, FI and IIi.)
**Immunohistochemical (a more recent form of fiber typing)
***Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC)
***Myosin Light Chain — alkali (MLC1)
***Myosin Light Chain — regulatory (MLC2)

**Gene characterization of myosins
::There are currently about 15 known different types of MHC genes recognized in muscle, only some of which may be expressed in a single muscle fiber. These genes form one of ~18 classes of myosin genes, identified as class II which should not be confused with the type II myosins identified by immunohistochemistry. The expression of multiple MHC genes in a single muscle fiber is an example of polymorphism. The relative expression of these myosin types is determined partly by genetics and partly by other biological factors such as activity, innervation and hormones.

The typing of motor units has thus gone through many stages and reached a point where it is recognized that muscle fibers contain varying mixtures of several myosin types that can not easily be classified into specific groups of fibers. The three (or four) classical fiber types represent peaks in the distribution of muscle fiber properties, each determined by the overall biochemistry of the fibers.

<text>Langkawi, officially known as Langkawi, the Jewel of Kedah (), is a duty-free island and an archipelago of 99 islands (plus five small islands visible only at low tide in the Strait of Malacca) located some 30 km off the coast of northwestern Malaysia and a few kilometres south of Ko Tarutao, adjacent to the Thai border. Politically, it is an administrative district of Kedah, with Kuah as its largest town. Pantai Cenang is the island&#x27;s most popular beach and tourist area.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Langkawi&quot; is thought to have existed by the early 15th century, although in the 16th century the island of Langkawi was also marked on maps variously as Langa, Langka, Lansura, and Langapura.

There are many suggestions for the origin of the name of Langkawi. According to one interpretation, &quot;Langkawi&quot; means island of the reddish-brown eagle, a Brahminy kite in colloquial Malay. The Malay word for eagle is (colloquially shortened to ), and is a red stone used as a chalk to mark goods. This interpretation was used to create the landmark sculpture of an eagle as the symbol of Langkawi at Dataran Helang (Eagle Square) in Kuah.

Some believed that Langkawi is the same as, or related to, the Lanka or Langkapuri mentioned in Indian sources. This ancient name Lanka (or Lankapura and Lankapuri) is found in Indian literature from an early period (named in &quot;Ramayana&quot; as the city of the king Ravana), although the identification of the original Lanka is not certain. or in Sanskrit means a town or city. The name Langkawi is also thought to be related to Langkasuka, an old kingdom believed to have links with Kedah. Some also thought that Langkawi means &quot;many beautiful islands&quot;, being a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;beautiful&quot; while means &quot;many&quot;.

In 2008, the Sultan Abdul Halim of Kedah, conferred the title of (meaning &#x27;Langkawi, the Jewel of Kedah&#x27;) upon the island as part of his golden jubilee as an affirmation of Kedah&#x27;s ownership over the island.

==History==
Langkawi had long been at the periphery of, but closely associated with, the domain of the Kedah Sultanate. Legend tells of a great snake &quot;ular besar&quot;, the custodian of the Langkawi Islands, to which a new king of Kedah must sacrifice a virgin daughter whenever he ascended the throne, or when war was declared with another state.

The island of Langkawi was recorded in history by various travellers to the region. It was called &quot;Lóngyápútí&quot; () in the 14th century by the Yuan dynasty traveller Wang Dayuan. When the Ming dynasty admiral Zheng He visited the region, the island was marked as , &quot;Lóngyájiāoyǐ&quot;, on his map. In the 15th century, it was known to the Acehnese as &quot;Pulau Lada&quot; (&#x27;Pepper Island&#x27;). In 1691, the French general Augustin de Beaulieu recorded going to the island of &quot;Lancahui&quot; (Langkawi) to buy pepper, and de Beaulieu was required to obtain a license from Kedah&#x27;s heir apparent in Perlis before the &quot;penghulu&quot; or chief of Langkawi would sell pepper to him.

Langkawi was historically home to Austronesian peoples, such as the Orang Laut, originally from the southern part of the Malay Peninsula and Malay people. It had been thought to be cursed for a couple of centuries. According to local legend, in the late 18th century, a woman named Mahsuri was wrongfully accused of adultery and put to death. Before she died, she placed a curse on the island that would last for seven generations. Not long after Mahsuri&#x27;s death, in 1821, the Siamese army invaded Kedah and attacked Langkawi. In the first attack, the locals burned down the granary at Padang Matsirat to starve the Siamese army. The Siamese nevertheless captured the island in May 1822, killed its leaders, and took many islanders as slaves, while others fled. Before the Siamese invasion, there was an estimated island population of 3,000–5,000, but only a small proportion was left after the invasion.

The island was recaptured from the Siamese in 1837. In 1840–1841, the Sultan of Kedah, who went into exile after the Siamese attacks, was allowed to return by the Siamese. The Langkawi islands&#x27; population recovered afterwards. However, the Orang Laut who fled after the Siamese attacks did not return. In 1909, the islands came under British rule following the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. The middle of the channel between Tarutao National Park and Langkawi became the Siamese border. During the World War II, Siam took control briefly as British Malaya fell to the Japanese.

Langkawi was a haven for pirates who attacked junks in the northern part of the Strait of Malacca. In a series of operations, between December 1945 and March 1946, the British cleared the pirates&#x27; land bases on Langkawi and Tarutao. The British continued to rule until Malaya gained its independence in 1957.

Langkawi remained a quiet backwater until 1986, when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad transformed it into a major tourist resort, helping to plan many of the islands&#x27; buildings himself. Mahsuri&#x27;s seven-generation curse was said to have lifted as a seventh generation descendant of Mahsuri was born in the Thai province of Phuket. The island rapidly grew as a tourist destination, and by 2012, it received over three million tourists a year.

== Geography ==
Langkawi, a cluster of 99 islands separated from mainland Malaysia by the Strait of Malacca, is a district of the state of Kedah in northern Malaysia and lies approximately west of Kedah. The total landmass of the islands is . The main island is about from north to south and slightly more from east to west. The coastal areas consist of flat, alluvial plains punctuated with limestone ridges. Two-thirds of the island is dominated by forest-covered mountains, hills, and natural vegetation.

The island&#x27;s oldest geological formation, the Machinchang Formation, was the first part of Southeast Asia to rise from the seabed in the Cambrian over half a billion years ago. The oldest part of the formation is observable at Teluk Datai to the northwest of the island, where the exposed outcrop consists of mainly sandstone (quartzite) in the upper parts and shale and mudstone in the lower parts of the sequence. The best exposure of Cambrian rocks (541 to 485 Ma) in Malaysia is the Machinchang Formation, composed of quartzose clastic rock formations, in Langkawi; the other known example, the Jerai Formation, emerges near the west coast of Kedah on the mainland. Geologically, all these rocks are in the Western Belt of Peninsular Malaysia, which is thought to be part of the Shan–Thai terrane.

== Climate ==
Langkawi receives more than of rain annually. Langkawi features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;). Langkawi has a short dry season from December until February. March to November is a long rainy season. September is the wettest month, when it can receive more than .

==Government and politics==

Langkawi Municipal Council, officially known as the Tourism City of Langkawi Municipal Council (, MPLBP) and formerly known as the Langkawi District Council () from 29 April 1987 until 23 March 2001, is the local authority of Langkawi.

==Administrative divisions==

Langkawi District is divided into 6 mukims, which are:
* Ayer Hangat
* Bohor
* Kedawang
* Kuah
* Padang Matsirat
* Ulu Melaka

==Demographics==

Only four of the 99 islands are inhabited: Langkawi (, the main island), Tuba, Rebak and Dayang Bunting. The population is approximately 99,000, around 65,000 of them in Langkawi, of which 90% are Malays. The other ethnic groups consist mainly of Chinese, Indians, and Thais.

Islam is practised primarily by ethnic Malays. Other major religions are Hinduism (mainly among Indians), Buddhism (mainly among Chinese and Thai), and Christianity (mostly Chinese).

Standard Malay is the official language. English is widely spoken and understood by the locals. Most natives speak a Langkawi variant of Kedah Malay, with minorities also speaking Chinese, Tamil and Siamese.

==Tourism==

On 1 June 2007, Langkawi Island was given a World Geopark status by UNESCO. Three of its main conservation areas in Langkawi Geopark are Machincang Cambrian Geoforest Park, Kilim Karst Geoforest Park, and Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest park (Island of the Pregnant Maiden Lake). These three parks are the most popular tourism area within Langkawi Geopark. In 2014, UNESCO issued a &quot;yellow card&quot; warning that the park could lose its status as a geopark.

===Cable car and Sky Bridge===

The Langkawi Cable Car takes visitors up to the peak of Gunung Mat Chinchang, where the Langkawi Sky Bridge is located. The Sky Bridge was closed in 2012 for maintenance and upgrading but reopened in February 2015. An inclined lift called SkyGlide that would take visitors from the top station to the Sky Bridge was completed in late 2015.

The start of the cable car ride is located in the Oriental Village where there are several attractions, including a 3-Dimensional art museum known as Art in Paradise.

===The Kilim Karst Geoforest Park (The Kilim River)===

The Kilim Karst Geoforest Park is a mangrove forest park which consists of limestone caves and three interconnected river estuaries that stretch approximately 10 km from Kisap village to Tanjung Rhu. Bats, crocodiles, eagles, kingfishers, monitor lizards, macaques, otters, snakes and tree crabs are some of the most commonly found wildlife in the park.

===MAHA Tower Langkawi===

MAHA Tower is a tower in Kuah, it is the latest addition, also part of the Langkawi City&#x27;s project. The tower is approximately 1.40 km from Dataran Lang.

===Relic of Mahsuri===

Relic of Mahsuri in Wings by Croske Resort Langkawi at Padang Matsirat, recorded the ancient history and story of Langkawi, is part of the State Government of Kedah&#x27;s Safe Langkawi project. The hand crafted featured stone wall is 200 meters from Langkawi International Airport .

===Durian Perangin Waterfall===

Durian Perangin Waterfall is a cascading waterfall located on the northeastern side of Langkawi Island, Malaysia. It is named after the durian trees that grow in the surrounding rainforest. The waterfall consists of multiple tiers, with natural pools at the base of each cascade.

==Transportation==
The island of Langkawi can be reached by sea and air. The Langkawi Jetty Point connects the island to main destinations like Kuala Perlis, Kuala Kedah, Penang and Tamalang. There&#x27;s also ferry service to Satun town and to Ko Lipe island in Thailand. The ferry between Langkawi and Ko Lipe operates from October until June. The departure/arrival point in Langkawi is at Kuah Jetty, Langkawi and Telaga Harbour, Langkawi. The departure/arrival point in Ko Lipe is at Pattaya Beach. As there is no pier in Ko Lipe, transfers to the beach are done with local long-tail boats. The journey takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Langkawi International Airport is one of seven international airports in Malaysia and connects the island to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Penang and Subang.

==Twin towns – Sister cities==
Langkawi currently has two sister cities:

* Kish Island, Iran.
* Mataram, Indonesia.

<text>Streatham railway station is a station in central Streatham in south London. Its main entrance now is on Streatham High Road, and is in Travelcard Zone 3.

Services are provided by Southern and Thameslink. Thameslink services go north to St Albans via London Blackfriars and St Pancras, and south to Wimbledon and Sutton. Southern services run between London Bridge and West Croydon.

A news kiosk in the street level ticket hall sells newspapers, coffee and snacks. There is no seating at this level. The platforms are below the station building and accessed by staircases. There has been no step-free disabled access to the northbound platform since the station forecourt on the up (northbound) platform side was redeveloped in the 1980s for the construction of a supermarket.
Ticket barriers were installed to the entrance in June 2009. New lifts providing step-free access from the entrance to both platforms have been constructed and were completed in Autumn 2023.

==Services==
Services at Streatham are operated by Southern and Thameslink using and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

<doc id="422476" wikidata="Q1632123" url="?curid=422476" title="Tetanic contraction">
<text>A tetanic contraction (also called tetanized state, tetanus, or physiologic tetanus, the latter to differentiate from the disease called tetanus) is a sustained muscle contraction evoked when the motor nerve that innervates a skeletal muscle emits action potentials at a very high rate. During this state, a motor unit has been maximally stimulated by its motor neuron and remains that way for some time. This occurs when a muscle&#x27;s motor unit is stimulated by multiple impulses at a sufficiently high frequency. Each stimulus causes a twitch. If stimuli are delivered slowly enough, the tension in the muscle will relax between successive twitches. If stimuli are delivered at high frequency, the twitches will overlap, resulting in tetanic contraction. A tetanic contraction can be either &quot;unfused (incomplete) or fused (complete)&quot;. An unfused tetanus is when the muscle fibers do not completely relax before the next stimulus because they are being stimulated at a fast rate; however there is a partial relaxation of the muscle fibers between the twitches. Fused tetanus is when there is no relaxation of the muscle fibers between stimuli and it occurs during a high rate of stimulation. A fused tetanic contraction is the strongest single-unit twitch in contraction. When tetanized, the contracting tension in the muscle remains constant in a steady state. This is the maximal possible contraction. During tetanic contractions, muscles can shorten, lengthen or remain constant length.

Tetanic contraction is usually normal (such as when holding up a heavy box). Muscles often exhibit some level of tetanic activity, leading to muscle tone, in order to maintain posture; for example, in a crouching position, some muscles require sustained contraction to hold the position. Tetanic contraction can exist in a variety of states, including isotonic and isometric forms—for example, lifting a heavy box off the floor is isotonic, but holding it at the elevated position is isometric. Isotonic contractions place muscles in a constant tension but the muscle length changes, while isometric contractions hold a constant muscle length.

Voluntary sustained contraction is a normal (physiologic) process (as in the crouching or box-holding examples), but involuntary sustained contraction exists on a spectrum from physiologic to disordered (pathologic). Muscle tone is a healthy form of involuntary sustained &quot;partial&quot; contraction. In comparison with tetanic contraction in an isometric state (such as holding up a heavy box for several minutes), it differs only in the percentage of motor units participating at any moment and the frequency of neural signals; but the low percentage and low frequency in healthy tone are the key factors defining it as healthy (and not tetanic). Involuntary sustained contraction of a hypertonic type, however, is a pathologic process. On the mild part of the spectrum, cramps, spasms, and even tetany are often temporary and nonsevere. On the moderate to severe parts of the spectrum are dystonia, trismus, pathologic tetanus, and other movement disorders featuring involuntary sustained strong contractions of skeletal muscle.

<text>In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the relationship between mass and energy in a system&#x27;s rest frame, where the two quantities differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement. The principle is described by the physicist Albert Einstein&#x27;s formula: formula_1. In a reference frame where the system is moving, its relativistic energy and relativistic mass (instead of rest mass) obey the same formula.

The formula defines the energy of a particle in its rest frame as the product of mass () with the speed of light squared (). Because the speed of light is a large number in everyday units (approximately ), the formula implies that a small amount of mass corresponds to an enormous amount of energy.

Rest mass, also called invariant mass, is a fundamental physical property of matter, independent of velocity. Massless particles such as photons have zero invariant mass, but massless free particles have both momentum and energy.

The equivalence principle implies that when mass is lost in chemical reactions or nuclear reactions, a corresponding amount of energy will be released. The energy can be released to the environment (outside of the system being considered) as radiant energy, such as light, or as thermal energy. The principle is fundamental to many fields of physics, including nuclear and particle physics.

Mass–energy equivalence arose from special relativity as a paradox described by the French polymath Henri Poincaré (1854–1912). Einstein was the first to propose the equivalence of mass and energy as a general principle and a consequence of the symmetries of space and time. The principle first appeared in &quot;Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy-content?&quot;, one of his &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; papers, published on 21 November 1905. The formula and its relationship to momentum, as described by the energy–momentum relation, were later developed by other physicists.

==Description==
Mass–energy equivalence states that all objects having mass, or &quot;massive objects&quot;, have a corresponding intrinsic energy, even when they are stationary. In the rest frame of an object, where by definition it is motionless and so has no momentum, the mass and energy are equal or they differ only by a constant factor, the speed of light squared (). In Newtonian mechanics, a motionless body has no kinetic energy, and it may or may not have other amounts of internal stored energy, like chemical energy or thermal energy, in addition to any potential energy it may have from its position in a field of force. These energies tend to be much smaller than the mass of the object multiplied by , which is on the order of 1017 joules for a mass of one kilogram. Due to this principle, the mass of the atoms that come out of a nuclear reaction is less than the mass of the atoms that go in, and the difference in mass shows up as heat and light with the same equivalent energy as the difference. In analyzing these extreme events, Einstein&#x27;s formula can be used with as the energy released (removed), and as the change in mass.

In relativity, all the energy that moves with an object (i.e., the energy as measured in the object&#x27;s rest frame) contributes to the total mass of the body, which measures how much it resists acceleration. If an isolated box of ideal mirrors could contain light, the individually massless photons would contribute to the total mass of the box by the amount equal to their energy divided by . For an observer in the rest frame, removing energy is the same as removing mass and the formula indicates how much mass is lost when energy is removed. In the same way, when any energy is added to an isolated system, the increase in the mass is equal to the added energy divided by .

==Mass in special relativity==
An object moves at different speeds in different frames of reference, depending on the motion of the observer. This implies the kinetic energy, in both Newtonian mechanics and relativity, is &#x27;frame dependent&#x27;, so that the amount of relativistic energy that an object is measured to have depends on the observer. The &quot;relativistic mass&quot; of an object is given by the relativistic energy divided by . Because the relativistic mass is exactly proportional to the relativistic energy, relativistic mass and relativistic energy are nearly synonymous; the only difference between them is the units. The &quot;rest mass&quot; or invariant mass of an object is defined as the mass an object has in its rest frame, when it is not moving with respect to the observer. Physicists typically use the term &quot;mass&quot;, though experiments have shown an object&#x27;s gravitational mass depends on its total energy and not just its rest mass. The rest mass is the same for all inertial frames, as it is independent of the motion of the observer, it is the smallest possible value of the relativistic mass of the object. Because of the attraction between components of a system, which results in potential energy, the rest mass is almost never additive; in general, the mass of an object is not the sum of the masses of its parts. The rest mass of an object is the total energy of all the parts, including kinetic energy, as observed from the center of momentum frame, and potential energy. The masses add up only if the constituents are at rest (as observed from the center of momentum frame) and do not attract or repel, so that they do not have any extra kinetic or potential energy. Massless particles are particles with no rest mass, and therefore have no intrinsic energy; their energy is due only to their momentum.

===Relativistic mass===
Relativistic mass depends on the motion of the object, so that different observers in relative motion see different values for it. The relativistic mass of a moving object is larger than the relativistic mass of an object at rest, because a moving object has kinetic energy. If the object moves slowly, the relativistic mass is nearly equal to the rest mass and both are nearly equal to the classical inertial mass (as it appears in Newton&#x27;s laws of motion). If the object moves quickly, the relativistic mass is greater than the rest mass by an amount equal to the mass associated with the kinetic energy of the object. Massless particles also have relativistic mass derived from their kinetic energy, equal to their relativistic energy divided by , or . The speed of light is one in a system where length and time are measured in natural units and the relativistic mass and energy would be equal in value and dimension. As it is just another name for the energy, the use of the term &quot;relativistic mass&quot; is redundant and physicists generally reserve &quot;mass&quot; to refer to rest mass, or invariant mass, as opposed to relativistic mass. A consequence of this terminology is that the mass is not conserved in special relativity, whereas the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy are both fundamental laws.

===Conservation of mass and energy===
Conservation of energy is a universal principle in physics and holds for any interaction, along with the conservation of momentum. The classical conservation of mass, in contrast, is violated in certain relativistic settings. This concept has been experimentally proven in a number of ways, including the conversion of mass into kinetic energy in nuclear reactions and other interactions between elementary particles. While modern physics has discarded the expression &#x27;conservation of mass&#x27;, in older terminology a relativistic mass can also be defined to be equivalent to the energy of a moving system, allowing for a &quot;conservation of relativistic mass&quot;. Mass conservation breaks down when the energy associated with the mass of a particle is converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or radiant energy.

===Massless particles===
Massless particles have zero rest mass. The Planck–Einstein relation for the energy for photons is given by the equation , where is the Planck constant and is the photon frequency. This frequency and thus the relativistic energy are frame-dependent. If an observer runs away from a photon in the direction the photon travels from a source, and it catches up with the observer, the observer sees it as having less energy than it had at the source. The faster the observer is traveling with regard to the source when the photon catches up, the less energy the photon would be seen to have. As an observer approaches the speed of light with regard to the source, the redshift of the photon increases, according to the relativistic Doppler effect. The energy of the photon is reduced and as the wavelength becomes arbitrarily large, the photon&#x27;s energy approaches zero, because of the massless nature of photons, which does not permit any intrinsic energy.

===Composite systems===
For closed systems made up of many parts, like an atomic nucleus, planet, or star, the relativistic energy is given by the sum of the relativistic energies of each of the parts, because energies are additive in these systems. If a system is &quot;bound&quot; by attractive forces, and the energy gained in excess of the work done is removed from the system, then mass is lost with this removed energy. The mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the total mass of the protons and neutrons that make it up. This mass decrease is also equivalent to the energy required to break up the nucleus into individual protons and neutrons. This effect can be understood by looking at the potential energy of the individual components. The individual particles have a force attracting them together, and forcing them apart increases the potential energy of the particles in the same way that lifting an object up on earth does. This energy is equal to the work required to split the particles apart. The mass of the Solar System is slightly less than the sum of its individual masses.

For an isolated system of particles moving in different directions, the invariant mass of the system is the analog of the rest mass, and is the same for all observers, even those in relative motion. It is defined as the total energy (divided by ) in the center of momentum frame. The &quot;center of momentum frame&quot; is defined so that the system has zero total momentum; the term center of mass frame is also sometimes used, where the &quot;center of mass frame&quot; is a special case of the center of momentum frame where the center of mass is put at the origin. A simple example of an object with moving parts but zero total momentum is a container of gas. In this case, the mass of the container is given by its total energy (including the kinetic energy of the gas molecules), since the system&#x27;s total energy and invariant mass are the same in any reference frame where the momentum is zero, and such a reference frame is also the only frame in which the object can be weighed. In a similar way, the theory of special relativity posits that the thermal energy in all objects, including solids, contributes to their total masses, even though this energy is present as the kinetic and potential energies of the atoms in the object, and it (in a similar way to the gas) is not seen in the rest masses of the atoms that make up the object. Similarly, even photons, if trapped in an isolated container, would contribute their energy to the mass of the container. Such extra mass, in theory, could be weighed in the same way as any other type of rest mass, even though individually photons have no rest mass. The property that trapped energy in any form adds weighable mass to systems that have no net momentum is one of the consequences of relativity. It has no counterpart in classical Newtonian physics, where energy never exhibits weighable mass.

===Relation to gravity===
Physics has two concepts of mass, the gravitational mass and the inertial mass. The gravitational mass is the quantity that determines the strength of the gravitational field generated by an object, as well as the gravitational force acting on the object when it is immersed in a gravitational field produced by other bodies. The inertial mass, on the other hand, quantifies how much an object accelerates if a given force is applied to it. The mass–energy equivalence in special relativity refers to the inertial mass. However, already in the context of Newtonian gravity, the weak equivalence principle is postulated: the gravitational and the inertial mass of every object are the same. Thus, the mass–energy equivalence, combined with the weak equivalence principle, results in the prediction that all forms of energy contribute to the gravitational field generated by an object. This observation is one of the pillars of the general theory of relativity.

The prediction that all forms of energy interact gravitationally has been subject to experimental tests. One of the first observations testing this prediction, called the Eddington experiment, was made during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919. During the eclipse, the English astronomer and physicist Arthur Eddington observed that the light from stars passing close to the Sun was bent. The effect is due to the gravitational attraction of light by the Sun. The observation confirmed that the energy carried by light indeed is equivalent to a gravitational mass. Another seminal experiment, the Pound–Rebka experiment, was performed in 1960. In this test a beam of light was emitted from the top of a tower and detected at the bottom. The frequency of the light detected was higher than the light emitted. This result confirms that the energy of photons increases when they fall in the gravitational field of the Earth. The energy, and therefore the gravitational mass, of photons is proportional to their frequency as stated by the Planck&#x27;s relation.

==Efficiency==
In some reactions, matter particles can be destroyed and their associated energy released to the environment as other forms of energy, such as light and heat. One example of such a conversion takes place in elementary particle interactions, where the rest energy is transformed into kinetic energy. Such conversions between types of energy happen in nuclear weapons, in which the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei lose a small fraction of their original mass, though the mass lost is not due to the destruction of any smaller constituents. Nuclear fission allows a tiny fraction of the energy associated with the mass to be converted into usable energy such as radiation; in the decay of the uranium, for instance, about 0.1% of the mass of the original atom is lost. In theory, it should be possible to destroy matter and convert all of the rest-energy associated with matter into heat and light, but none of the theoretically known methods are practical. One way to harness all the energy associated with mass is to annihilate matter with antimatter. Antimatter is rare in the universe, however, and the known mechanisms of production require more usable energy than would be released in annihilation. CERN estimated in 2011 that over a billion times more energy is required to make and store antimatter than could be released in its annihilation.

As most of the mass which comprises ordinary objects resides in protons and neutrons, converting all the energy of ordinary matter into more useful forms requires that the protons and neutrons be converted to lighter particles, or particles with no mass at all. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the number of protons plus neutrons is nearly exactly conserved. Despite this, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft showed that there is a process that converts protons and neutrons to antielectrons and neutrinos. This is the weak SU(2) instanton proposed by the physicists Alexander Belavin, Alexander Markovich Polyakov, Albert Schwarz, and Yu. S. Tyupkin. This process, can in principle destroy matter and convert all the energy of matter into neutrinos and usable energy, but it is normally extraordinarily slow. It was later shown that the process occurs rapidly at extremely high temperatures that would only have been reached shortly after the Big Bang.

Many extensions of the standard model contain magnetic monopoles, and in some models of grand unification, these monopoles catalyze proton decay, a process known as the Callan–Rubakov effect. This process would be an efficient mass–energy conversion at ordinary temperatures, but it requires making monopoles and anti-monopoles, whose production is expected to be inefficient. Another method of completely annihilating matter uses the gravitational field of black holes. The British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking theorized it is possible to throw matter into a black hole and use the emitted heat to generate power. According to the theory of Hawking radiation, however, larger black holes radiate less than smaller ones, so that usable power can only be produced by small black holes.

==Extension for systems in motion==
Unlike a system&#x27;s energy in an inertial frame, the relativistic energy (formula_2) of a system depends on both the rest mass (formula_3) and the total momentum of the system. The extension of Einstein&#x27;s equation to these systems is given by:

:formula_4

or

formula_5

where the formula_6 term represents the square of the Euclidean norm (total vector length) of the various momentum vectors in the system, which reduces to the square of the simple momentum magnitude, if only a single particle is considered. This equation is called the energy–momentum relation and reduces to formula_7 when the momentum term is zero. For photons where formula_8, the equation reduces to formula_9.

==Low-speed approximation==
Using the Lorentz factor, , the energy–momentum can be rewritten as and expanded as a power series:
:formula_10

For speeds much smaller than the speed of light, higher-order terms in this expression get smaller and smaller because is small. For low speeds, all but the first two terms can be ignored:
:formula_11

In classical mechanics, both the term and the high-speed corrections are ignored. The initial value of the energy is arbitrary, as only the change in energy can be measured and so the term is ignored in classical physics. While the higher-order terms become important at higher speeds, the Newtonian equation is a highly accurate low-speed approximation; adding in the third term yields:
:formula_12.
The difference between the two approximations is given by formula_13, a number very small for everyday objects. In 2018 NASA announced the Parker Solar Probe was the fastest ever, with a speed of . The difference between the approximations for the Parker Solar Probe in 2018 is formula_14, which accounts for an energy correction of four parts per hundred million. The gravitational constant, in contrast, has a standard relative uncertainty of about formula_15.

==Applications==
===Application to nuclear physics===

The nuclear binding energy is the minimum energy that is required to disassemble the nucleus of an atom into its component parts. The mass of an atom is less than the sum of the masses of its constituents due to the attraction of the strong nuclear force. The difference between the two masses is called the &quot;mass defect&quot; and is related to the binding energy through Einstein&#x27;s formula. The principle is used in modeling nuclear fission reactions, and it implies that a great amount of energy can be released by the nuclear fission chain reactions used in both nuclear weapons and nuclear power.

A water molecule weighs a little less than two free hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. The minuscule mass difference is the energy needed to split the molecule into three individual atoms (divided by ), which was given off as heat when the molecule formed (this heat had mass). Similarly, a stick of dynamite in theory weighs a little bit more than the fragments after the explosion; in this case the mass difference is the energy and heat that is released when the dynamite explodes. Such a change in mass may only happen when the system is open, and the energy and mass are allowed to escape. Thus, if a stick of dynamite is blown up in a hermetically sealed chamber, the mass of the chamber and fragments, the heat, sound, and light would still be equal to the original mass of the chamber and dynamite. If sitting on a scale, the weight and mass would not change. This would in theory also happen even with a nuclear bomb, if it could be kept in an ideal box of infinite strength, which did not rupture or pass radiation. Thus, a 21.5 kiloton () nuclear bomb produces about one gram of heat and electromagnetic radiation, but the mass of this energy would not be detectable in an exploded bomb in an ideal box sitting on a scale; instead, the contents of the box would be heated to millions of degrees without changing total mass and weight. If a transparent window passing only electromagnetic radiation were opened in such an ideal box after the explosion, and a beam of X-rays and other lower-energy light allowed to escape the box, it would eventually be found to weigh one gram less than it had before the explosion. This weight loss and mass loss would happen as the box was cooled by this process, to room temperature. However, any surrounding mass that absorbed the X-rays (and other &quot;heat&quot;) would &quot;gain&quot; this gram of mass from the resulting heating, thus, in this case, the mass &quot;loss&quot; would represent merely its relocation.

===Practical examples===
Einstein used the centimetre–gram–second system of units (cgs), but the formula is independent of the system of units. In natural units, the numerical value of the speed of light is set to equal 1, and the formula expresses an equality of numerical values: . In the SI system (expressing the ratio in joules per kilogram using the value of in metres per second):

: (≈ 9.0 × 1016 joules per kilogram).

So the energy equivalent of one kilogram of mass is
* 89.9 petajoules
* 25.0 billion kilowatt-hours (≈ 25,000 GW·h)
* 21.5 trillion kilocalories (≈ 21 Pcal)
* 85.2 trillion BTUs
* 0.0852 quads or the energy released by combustion of the following:
* 21 500 kilotons of TNT-equivalent energy (≈ 21 Mt)
* litres or US gallons of automotive gasoline

Any time energy is released, the process can be evaluated from an perspective. For instance, the &quot;gadget&quot;-style bomb used in the Trinity test and the bombing of Nagasaki had an explosive yield equivalent to 21 kt of TNT. About 1 kg of the approximately 6.15 kg of plutonium in each of these bombs fissioned into lighter elements totaling almost exactly one gram less, after cooling. The electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy (thermal and blast energy) released in this explosion carried the missing gram of mass.

Whenever energy is added to a system, the system gains mass, as shown when the equation is rearranged:
* A spring&#x27;s mass increases whenever it is put into compression or tension. Its mass increase arises from the increased potential energy stored within it, which is bound in the stretched chemical (electron) bonds linking the atoms within the spring.
* Raising the temperature of an object (increasing its thermal energy) increases its mass. For example, consider the world&#x27;s primary mass standard for the kilogram, made of platinum and iridium. If its temperature is allowed to change by 1 °C, its mass changes by 1.5 picograms (1 pg = ).
* A spinning ball has greater mass than when it is not spinning. Its increase of mass is exactly the equivalent of the mass of energy of rotation, which is itself the sum of the kinetic energies of all the moving parts of the ball. For example, the Earth itself is more massive due to its rotation, than it would be with no rotation. The rotational energy of the Earth is greater than 1024 Joules, which is over 107 kg.

==History==

While Einstein was the first to have correctly deduced the mass–energy equivalence formula, he was not the first to have related energy with mass, though nearly all previous authors thought that the energy that contributes to mass comes only from electromagnetic fields. Once discovered, Einstein&#x27;s formula was initially written in many different notations, and its interpretation and justification was further developed in several steps.

===Developments prior to Einstein===
Eighteenth century theories on the correlation of mass and energy included that devised by the English scientist Isaac Newton in 1717, who speculated that light particles and matter particles were interconvertible in &quot;Query 30&quot; of the &quot;Opticks&quot;, where he asks: &quot;Are not the gross bodies and light convertible into one another, and may not bodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition?&quot; Swedish scientist and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, in his &quot;Principia&quot; of 1734 theorized that all matter is ultimately composed of dimensionless points of &quot;pure and total motion&quot;. He described this motion as being without force, direction or speed, but having the potential for force, direction and speed everywhere within it.

During the nineteenth century there were several speculative attempts to show that mass and energy were proportional in various ether theories. In 1873 the Russian physicist and mathematician Nikolay Umov pointed out a relation between mass and energy for ether in the form of , where . English engineer Samuel Tolver Preston in 1875 and the Italian industrialist and geologist Olinto De Pretto in 1903, following physicist Georges-Louis Le Sage, imagined that the universe was filled with an ether of tiny particles that always move at speed . Each of these particles has a kinetic energy of up to a small numerical factor, giving a mass–energy relation. 

In 1905, independently of Einstein, French polymath Gustave Le Bon speculated that atoms could release large amounts of latent energy, reasoning from an all-encompassing qualitative philosophy of physics.

====Electromagnetic mass====

There were many attempts in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century—like those of British physicists J. J. Thomson in 1881 and Oliver Heaviside in 1889, and George Frederick Charles Searle in 1897, German physicists Wilhelm Wien in 1900 and Max Abraham in 1902, and the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz in 1904—to understand how the mass of a charged object depends on the electrostatic field. This concept was called electromagnetic mass, and was considered as being dependent on velocity and direction as well. Lorentz in 1904 gave the following expressions for longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic mass:
:formula_16,

where
:formula_17

Another way of deriving a type of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of radiation pressure. In 1900, French polymath Henri Poincaré associated electromagnetic radiation energy with a &quot;fictitious fluid&quot; having momentum and mass 
:formula_18

By that, Poincaré tried to save the center of mass theorem in Lorentz&#x27;s theory, though his treatment led to radiation paradoxes.

Austrian physicist Friedrich Hasenöhrl showed in 1904 that electromagnetic cavity radiation contributes the &quot;apparent mass&quot;
:formula_17

to the cavity&#x27;s mass. He argued that this implies mass dependence on temperature as well.

===Einstein: mass–energy equivalence===
Einstein did not write the exact formula in his 1905 &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; paper &quot;Does the Inertia of an object Depend Upon Its Energy Content?&quot;; rather, the paper states that if a body gives off the energy by emitting light, its mass diminishes by . This formulation relates only a change in mass to a change in energy without requiring the absolute relationship. The relationship convinced him that mass and energy can be seen as two names for the same underlying, conserved physical quantity. He has stated that the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass are &quot;one and the same&quot;. Einstein elaborated in a 1946 essay that &quot;the principle of the conservation of mass… proved inadequate in the face of the special theory of relativity. It was therefore merged with the energy conservation principle—just as, about 60 years before, the principle of the conservation of mechanical energy had been combined with the principle of the conservation of heat [thermal energy]. We might say that the principle of the conservation of energy, having previously swallowed up that of the conservation of heat, now proceeded to swallow that of the conservation of mass—and holds the field alone.&quot;

====Mass–velocity relationship====
In developing special relativity, Einstein found that the kinetic energy of a moving body is
:formula_20

with the velocity, the rest mass, and the Lorentz factor.

He included the second term on the right to make sure that for small velocities the energy would be the same as in classical mechanics, thus satisfying the correspondence principle:
:formula_21

Without this second term, there would be an additional contribution in the energy when the particle is not moving.

====Einstein&#x27;s view on mass====
Einstein, following Lorentz and Abraham, used velocity- and direction-dependent mass concepts in his 1905 electrodynamics paper and in another paper in 1906. In Einstein&#x27;s first 1905 paper on , he treated as what would now be called the &quot;rest mass&quot;, and it has been noted that in his later years he did not like the idea of &quot;relativistic mass&quot;.

In older physics terminology, relativistic energy is used in lieu of relativistic mass and the term &quot;mass&quot; is reserved for the rest mass. Historically, there has been considerable debate over the use of the concept of &quot;relativistic mass&quot; and the connection of &quot;mass&quot; in relativity to &quot;mass&quot; in Newtonian dynamics. One view is that only rest mass is a viable concept and is a property of the particle; while relativistic mass is a conglomeration of particle properties and properties of spacetime. Another view, attributed to Norwegian physicist Kjell Vøyenli, is that the Newtonian concept of mass as a particle property and the relativistic concept of mass have to be viewed as embedded in their own theories and as having no precise connection.

====Einstein&#x27;s 1905 derivation====
Already in his relativity paper &quot;On the electrodynamics of moving bodies&quot;, Einstein derived the correct expression for the kinetic energy of particles:
:formula_22.

Now the question remained open as to which formulation applies to bodies at rest. This was tackled by Einstein in his paper &quot;Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?&quot;, one of his Annus Mirabilis papers. Here, Einstein used to represent the speed of light in vacuum and to represent the energy lost by a body in the form of radiation. Consequently, the equation was not originally written as a formula but as a sentence in German saying that &quot;if a body gives off the energy in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by .&quot; A remark placed above it informed that the equation was approximated by neglecting &quot;magnitudes of fourth and higher orders&quot; of a series expansion. Einstein used a body emitting two light pulses in opposite directions, having energies of before and after the emission as seen in its rest frame. As seen from a moving frame, becomes and becomes . Einstein obtained, in modern notation:
:formula_23.

He then argued that can only differ from the kinetic energy by an additive constant, which gives
:formula_24.

Neglecting effects higher than third order in after a Taylor series expansion of the right side of this yields:
:formula_25

Einstein concluded that the emission reduces the body&#x27;s mass by , and that the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content.

The correctness of Einstein&#x27;s 1905 derivation of was criticized by German theoretical physicist Max Planck in 1907, who argued that it is only valid to first approximation. Another criticism was formulated by American physicist Herbert Ives in 1952 and the Israeli physicist Max Jammer in 1961, asserting that Einstein&#x27;s derivation is based on begging the question. Other scholars, such as American and Chilean philosophers John Stachel and Roberto Torretti, have argued that Ives&#x27; criticism was wrong, and that Einstein&#x27;s derivation was correct. American physics writer Hans Ohanian, in 2008, agreed with Stachel/Torretti&#x27;s criticism of Ives, though he argued that Einstein&#x27;s derivation was wrong for other reasons.

====Relativistic center-of-mass theorem of 1906====
Like Poincaré, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of electromagnetic energy is a necessary condition for the center-of-mass theorem to hold. On this occasion, Einstein referred to Poincaré&#x27;s 1900 paper and wrote: &quot;Although the merely formal considerations, which we will need for the proof, are already mostly contained in a work by H. Poincaré2, for the sake of clarity I will not rely on that work.&quot; In Einstein&#x27;s more physical, as opposed to formal or mathematical, point of view, there was no need for fictitious masses. He could avoid the &quot;perpetual motion&quot; problem because, on the basis of the mass–energy equivalence, he could show that the transport of inertia that accompanies the emission and absorption of radiation solves the problem. Poincaré&#x27;s rejection of the principle of action–reaction can be avoided through Einstein&#x27;s , because mass conservation appears as a special case of the energy conservation law.

====Further developments====
There were several further developments in the first decade of the twentieth century. In May 1907, Einstein explained that the expression for energy of a moving mass point assumes the simplest form when its expression for the state of rest is chosen to be (where is the mass), which is in agreement with the &quot;principle of the equivalence of mass and energy&quot;. In addition, Einstein used the formula , with being the energy of a system of mass points, to describe the energy and mass increase of that system when the velocity of the differently moving mass points is increased. Max Planck rewrote Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy relationship as in June 1907, where is the pressure and the volume to express the relation between mass, its latent energy, and thermodynamic energy within the body. Subsequently, in October 1907, this was rewritten as and given a quantum interpretation by German physicist Johannes Stark, who assumed its validity and correctness. In December 1907, Einstein expressed the equivalence in the form and concluded: &quot;A mass is equivalent, as regards inertia, to a quantity of energy . […] It appears far more natural to consider every inertial mass as a store of energy.&quot; American physical chemists Gilbert N. Lewis and Richard C. Tolman used two variations of the formula in 1909: and , with being the relativistic energy (the energy of an object when the object is moving), is the rest energy (the energy when not moving), is the relativistic mass (the rest mass and the extra mass gained when moving), and is the rest mass. The same relations in different notation were used by Lorentz in 1913 and 1914, though he placed the energy on the left-hand side: and , with being the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy) of a moving material point, its rest energy, the relativistic mass, and the invariant mass.

In 1911, German physicist Max von Laue gave a more comprehensive proof of from the stress–energy tensor, which was later generalized by German mathematician Felix Klein in 1918.

Einstein returned to the topic once again after World War II and this time he wrote in the title of his article intended as an explanation for a general reader by analogy.

====Alternative version====
An alternative version of Einstein&#x27;s thought experiment was proposed by American theoretical physicist Fritz Rohrlich in 1990, who based his reasoning on the Doppler effect. Like Einstein, he considered a body at rest with mass . If the body is examined in a frame moving with nonrelativistic velocity , it is no longer at rest and in the moving frame it has momentum . Then he supposed the body emits two pulses of light to the left and to the right, each carrying an equal amount of energy . In its rest frame, the object remains at rest after the emission since the two beams are equal in strength and carry opposite momentum. However, if the same process is considered in a frame that moves with velocity to the left, the pulse moving to the left is redshifted, while the pulse moving to the right is blue shifted. The blue light carries more momentum than the red light, so that the momentum of the light in the moving frame is not balanced: the light is carrying some net momentum to the right. The object has not changed its velocity before or after the emission. Yet in this frame it has lost some right-momentum to the light. The only way it could have lost momentum is by losing mass. This also solves Poincaré&#x27;s radiation paradox. The velocity is small, so the right-moving light is blueshifted by an amount equal to the nonrelativistic Doppler shift factor . The momentum of the light is its energy divided by , and it is increased by a factor of . So the right-moving light is carrying an extra momentum given by:
:formula_26

The left-moving light carries a little less momentum, by the same amount . So the total right-momentum in both light pulses is twice . This is the right-momentum that the object lost.
:formula_27

The momentum of the object in the moving frame after the emission is reduced to this amount:
:formula_28

So the change in the object&#x27;s mass is equal to the total energy lost divided by . Since any emission of energy can be carried out by a two-step process, where first the energy is emitted as light and then the light is converted to some other form of energy, any emission of energy is accompanied by a loss of mass. Similarly, by considering absorption, a gain in energy is accompanied by a gain in mass.

===Radioactivity and nuclear energy===
It was quickly noted after the discovery of radioactivity in 1897 that the total energy due to radioactive processes is about one million times greater than that involved in any known molecular change, raising the question of where the energy comes from. After eliminating the idea of absorption and emission of some sort of Lesagian ether particles, the existence of a huge amount of latent energy, stored within matter, was proposed by New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford and British radiochemist Frederick Soddy in 1903. Rutherford also suggested that this internal energy is stored within normal matter as well. He went on to speculate in 1904: &quot;If it were ever found possible to control at will the rate of disintegration of the radio-elements, an enormous amount of energy could be obtained from a small quantity of matter.&quot;

Einstein&#x27;s equation does not explain the large energies released in radioactive decay, but can be used to quantify them. The theoretical explanation for radioactive decay is given by the nuclear forces responsible for holding atoms together, though these forces were still unknown in 1905. The enormous energy released from radioactive decay had previously been measured by Rutherford and was much more easily measured than the small change in the gross mass of materials as a result. Einstein&#x27;s equation, by theory, can give these energies by measuring mass differences before and after reactions, but in practice, these mass differences in 1905 were still too small to be measured in bulk. Prior to this, the ease of measuring radioactive decay energies with a calorimeter was thought possibly likely to allow measurement of changes in mass difference, as a check on Einstein&#x27;s equation itself. Einstein mentions in his 1905 paper that mass–energy equivalence might perhaps be tested with radioactive decay, which was known by then to release enough energy to possibly be &quot;weighed,&quot; when missing from the system. However, radioactivity seemed to proceed at its own unalterable pace, and even when simple nuclear reactions became possible using proton bombardment, the idea that these great amounts of usable energy could be liberated at will with any practicality, proved difficult to substantiate. Rutherford was reported in 1933 to have declared that this energy could not be exploited efficiently: &quot;Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of the atom is talking moonshine.&quot;

This outlook changed dramatically in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron and its mass, allowing mass differences for single nuclides and their reactions to be calculated directly, and compared with the sum of masses for the particles that made up their composition. In 1933, the energy released from the reaction of lithium-7 plus protons giving rise to two alpha particles, allowed Einstein&#x27;s equation to be tested to an error of ±0.5%. However, scientists still did not see such reactions as a practical source of power, due to the energy cost of accelerating reaction particles. After the very public demonstration of huge energies released from nuclear fission after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the equation became directly linked in the public eye with the power and peril of nuclear weapons. The equation was featured on page 2 of the Smyth Report, the official 1945 release by the US government on the development of the atomic bomb, and by 1946 the equation was linked closely enough with Einstein&#x27;s work that the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine prominently featured a picture of Einstein next to an image of a mushroom cloud emblazoned with the equation. Einstein himself had only a minor role in the Manhattan Project: he had cosigned a letter to the U.S. president in 1939 urging funding for research into atomic energy, warning that an atomic bomb was theoretically possible. The letter persuaded Roosevelt to devote a significant portion of the wartime budget to atomic research. Without a security clearance, Einstein&#x27;s only scientific contribution was an analysis of an isotope separation method in theoretical terms. It was inconsequential, on account of Einstein not being given sufficient information to fully work on the problem.

While is useful for understanding the amount of energy potentially released in a fission reaction, it was not strictly necessary to develop the weapon, once the fission process was known, and its energy measured at 200 MeV (which was directly possible, using a quantitative Geiger counter, at that time). The physicist and Manhattan Project participant Robert Serber noted that somehow &quot;the popular notion took hold long ago that Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, in particular his equation , plays some essential role in the theory of fission. Einstein had a part in alerting the United States government to the possibility of building an atomic bomb, but his theory of relativity is not required in discussing fission. The theory of fission is what physicists call a non-relativistic theory, meaning that relativistic effects are too small to affect the dynamics of the fission process significantly.&quot; There are other views on the equation&#x27;s importance to nuclear reactions. In late 1938, the Austrian-Swedish and British physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch—while on a winter walk during which they solved the meaning of Hahn&#x27;s experimental results and introduced the idea that would be called atomic fission—directly used Einstein&#x27;s equation to help them understand the quantitative energetics of the reaction that overcame the &quot;surface tension-like&quot; forces that hold the nucleus together, and allowed the fission fragments to separate to a configuration from which their charges could force them into an energetic &quot;fission&quot;. To do this, they used &quot;packing fraction&quot;, or nuclear binding energy values for elements. These, together with use of allowed them to realize on the spot that the basic fission process was energetically possible.

===Einstein&#x27;s equation written===
According to the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, there remain only four known copies of this equation as written by Einstein. One of these is a letter written in German to Ludwik Silberstein, which was in Silberstein&#x27;s archives, and sold at auction for $1.2 million, RR Auction of Boston, Massachusetts said on May 21, 2021.

<text>The London Review of Books (LRB) is a British literary magazine published bimonthly (twice a month) that features articles and essays on fiction and non-fiction subjects, which are usually structured as book reviews.

==History==
The &quot;London Review of Books&quot; was founded in 1979, when publication of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; was suspended during the year-long lock-out at &quot;The Times&quot;. Its founding editors were Karl Miller, then professor of English at University College London; Mary-Kay Wilmers, formerly an editor at &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;; and Susannah Clapp, a former editor at Jonathan Cape. For its first six months, it appeared as an insert in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. It became an independent publication in May 1980. Its political stance has been described by Alan Bennett, a prominent contributor, as &quot;consistently radical&quot;.

Unlike &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (TLS), the majority of the articles the &quot;LRB&quot; publishes (usually fifteen per issue) are long essays. Some articles in each issue are not based on books, while several short articles discuss film or exhibitions. Political and social essays are frequent. The magazine is headquartered in Bloomsbury, London.

Wilmers took over as editor in 1992 and remained as editor for almost 30 years. She was succeeded by Jean McNicol and Alice Spawls in 2021. Average circulation per issue for January to December 2023 was 74,743. 

In January 2010, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;London Review&quot; was £27M in debt to the Wilmers&#x27; family trust, although the trust had &quot;no intention of the lender seeking repayment of the loan in the near future&quot;.

The London Review Bookshop opened in Bloomsbury in May 2003, and the Cake Shop next door in November 2007. The bookshop is used as a venue for author presentations and discussions.

In 2011, when Pankaj Mishra criticised Niall Ferguson&#x27;s book &quot;Civilisation: The West and the Rest&quot; in the &quot;LRB&quot;, Ferguson threatened to sue for libel.

In 2023, Hebrew Writers Association in Israel openly published a protest response to the letter of support for Gaza that was published in the journal, and called writers and artists around the world to support the freeing of the kidnapped.

In January 2024, &quot;A Hitch in Time: Reflections Ready for Reconsideration&quot;, an anthology of Christopher Hitchens writings between 1983 and 2002 for &quot;The London Review of Books&quot;, was published.

<text>The yellow badge, also known as the yellow patch, the Jewish badge, or the yellow star (, ), was an accessory that Jews were required to wear in certain non-Jewish societies throughout history. A Jew&#x27;s ethno-religious identity, which would be denoted by the badge, would help to mark them as an outsider. Legislation that mandated Jewish subjects to wear such items has been documented in some Middle Eastern caliphates and in some European kingdoms during the medieval period and the early modern period. The most recent usage of yellow badges was during World War II, when Jews living in Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe were ordered to wear a yellow Star of David to keep their Jewish identity disclosed to the public in the years leading up to the Holocaust.

==History==
===Muslim world===
The practice of wearing special clothing or markings to distinguish Jews and other non-Muslims (dhimmis) in Muslim-dominated countries seems to have been introduced in the Umayyad Caliphate by Caliph Umar II in the early 8th century. In the 9th century, Islamic authorities begun to harden their attitude on &quot;ghiyār&quot;, or the differentiating of non-Muslims from Muslims. The Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil issued a decree in 850 that ordered Jews and Christians to wear the zunnar, honey-coloured outer garments and badge-like patches on their on their servants&#x27; clothing. This begun the long tradition of differentiating by colour, though the colour and badges would change over time and place.

The clothing was also enforced outside of the Islamic heartlands. In Aghlabid Northern Africa and Sicily dhimmis were required to wear a patch (&quot;ruq&#x27;a&quot;) of white fabric on the shoulder of their outer garment, with the patch for Jews being a in the image of an ape and for Christians the image of a pig. It is not clear how long this humiliating decree remained in force, but it is clear that in the Maghrebi case, the purpose of the patch was not merely &quot;ghiyār&quot; (differentiation), but also &quot;dhull&quot; (humiliation) in keeping with the koranic injunction (Sura 9:29) that non-Muslims should be humbled. A genizah document from 1121 gives the following description of decrees issued in Baghdad:

In the late twelfth century, the Almohads forced the Jews of North Africa to wear yellow cloaks and turbans, a practice the subsequent Hafsid dynasty continued to follow. In 1250, under Hafsid caliph al-Mustansir, Jews had to wear some sort of distinguishing badge (&quot;shikla&quot;), though it is not exactly known how it looked like and it may have referred to both a special patch and an overall attire unique to Jews. At the same time, the Ayyubid Sultan decreed that the life and property of any Jew or Christian found in the street without a distinguishing badge (&quot;&#x27;alāma&quot;) or &quot;zunnar&quot; would be forfeit. Mid-fifteenth century reports describe the &quot;shikla&quot; as a piece of yellow cloth worn on the outer clothing that Tunisian Jews were obliged to wear. The &quot;shikla&quot; ceased to be used in Morocco from the sixteenth century, but it continued to be such a regular defining mark of Tunisian Jews up to the nineteenth century, that they were commonly referred to as &quot;shikliyyūn&quot; (&quot;those who wear the sign&quot;).

===Medieval and early modern Europe===

In largely Catholic Medieval Europe, Jews and Muslims were required to wear distinguishable clothing in some periods. These measures were not seen as being inconsistent with the papal bulls &#x27;. Most significantly, the Fourth Council of the Lateran headed by Pope Innocent III ruled in 1215 that Jews and Muslims must wear distinguishable dress (Latin &#x27;). This wording of the council decree may have been influenced indirectly by the Muslim requirements for Jews. Canon 68 reads, in part:

Innocent III had in 1199 confirmed &quot;&quot;, which was also confirmed by Pope Honorius III in 1216. In 1219, Honorius III issued a dispensation to the Jews of Castile, the largest Jewish population in Europe. Spanish Jews normally wore turbans, which presumably met the requirement to be distinctive. Elsewhere, local laws were introduced to bring the canon into effect. The identifying mark varied from one country to another, and from period to period.

In 1227, the Synod of Narbonne, in canon 3, ruled:

However, these ecclesiastic pronouncements required legal sanctions of a temporal authority. In 1228, James I of Aragon ordered Jews of Aragon to wear the badge; and in 1265, the &quot;&quot;, a legal code enacted in Castile by Alfonso X but not implemented until many years later, included a requirement for Jews to wear distinguishing marks. On 19 June 1269, Louis IX of France imposed a fine of ten livres (one livre was equivalent to a pound of silver) on Jews found in public without a badge (, or ). The enforcement of wearing the badge is repeated by local councils, with varying degrees of fines, at Arles 1234 and 1260, Béziers 1246, Albi 1254, Nîmes 1284 and 1365, Avignon 1326 and 1337, Rodez 1336, and Vanves 1368. The &quot;rota&quot; looked like a ring of white or yellow. The shape and colour of the patch also varied, although the colour was usually white or yellow. Married women were often required to wear two bands of blue on their veil or head-scarf.

In 1274, Edward I of England enacted the Statute of Jewry, which also included a requirement:

In Europe, Jews were required to wear the or , a cone-shaped hat, in most cases yellow. In 1267, the Vienna city council ordered Jews to wear this type of hat rather than a badge. There is a reference to a dispensation from the badge in Erfurt on 16 October 1294, the earliest reference to the badge in Germany. There were also attempts to enforce the wearing of full-length robes, which in late 14th-century Rome were supposed to be red. In Portugal, a red Star of David was used.

Enforcement of the rules was variable; in Marseille the magistrates ignored accusations of breaches, and in some places individuals or communities could buy exemption. Cathars who were considered &quot;first time offenders&quot; by the Catholic Church and the Inquisition were also forced to wear yellow badges, albeit in the form of crosses, about their person.

The yellow badge remained the key distinguishing mark of Jewish dress in the Middle Ages. From the 16th century, the use of the &quot;&quot; declined, but the badge tended to outlast it, surviving into the 18th century in places.

===Axis powers===

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland in 1939, there were different local decrees requiring Jews to wear a distinctive sign under the General Government. The sign was a white armband with a blue Star of David on it; in the Warthegau a yellow badge in the form of a Star of David on the left side of the breast and on the back. The requirement to wear the Star of David with the word (German for &#x27;Jew&#x27;) – inscribed in Faux Hebrew letters meant to resemble Hebrew writing – was then extended to all Jews over the age of six in the Reich and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (by a decree issued on 1 September 1941, signed by Reinhard Heydrich) and was gradually introduced in other German-occupied areas, where local words were used (e.g. in French, in Dutch).

One observer reported that the star increased German non-Nazi sympathy for Jews as the impoverished citizens who wore them were, contrary to Nazi propaganda, obviously not the cause of German failure on the Eastern Front. In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, government had to ban hat tipping towards Jews and other courtesies that became popular as protests against the German occupation. A whispering campaign that claimed that the action was in response to the United States government requiring German Americans to wear swastikas was unsuccessful.

===Post–World War II===
In May 2001, the Taliban government in Afghanistan ruled that Hindus in the country must wear a yellow badge, causing international outcry.

In May 2021, in response to the anti-vaccine movement in the United States, hatWRKS, a hat store in Nashville, Tennessee, sold badges that resembled the yellow stars with the words &quot;Not vaccinated&quot; on them. In response, the Stetson company announced they would no longer sell any hats to the store. This also sparked protests outside the store. The practice of wearing yellow stars in protests against responses to the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Montreal, London, Amsterdam and Paris. The practice sparked condemnation by various Jewish advocacy groups and Holocaust survivors.

On 31 October 2023, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Gilad Erdan, as well as other Israeli delegates, began wearing yellow star badges with the words &quot;Never Again&quot; written on them, in protest to criticism of Israel&#x27;s conduct during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. Erdan claimed that the UN Security Council was &quot;silent&quot; about the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, and said that he would wear the star &quot;as a symbol of pride&quot;. However, this decision was immediately condemned by Yad Vashem chairman Dani Dayan, calling it a &quot;[disgrace to] the victims of the Holocaust as well as the state of Israel&quot;, pointing out that the slaughter of Jews by Hamas differs from the Holocaust in that &quot;Jews have today a state and an army. We are not defenseless and at the mercy of others.&quot; According to Ynet, unnamed officials from Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs were also highly critical of the decision, with one calling it a &quot;cheap gimmick that doesn’t serve our goal&quot;, and others describing it as an attempt to appeal to Likud party members.

==Timeline==
===Caliphates===
;717–720: Caliph Umar II orders non-Muslims (dhimmi) to wear vestimentary distinctions (called &quot;giyār&quot;, i.e. distinguishing marks).
;847–861: Caliph al-Mutawakkil reinforces and reissues the edict. Christians are required to wear patches. One of the patches was to be worn in front of the breast and the other on the back. They were required to be honey-coloured.
;888: Ibrahim ibn Ahmad, the Aghlabid ruler of North Africa and Sicily, proclaims an order according to which Jews have to wear a patch depicting a monkey and Christians one depicting a pig.
;1005: The Fatimid caliph al-Hakim forces Jews to wear black robes and a wooden image of a calf in public and a bell around their neck when in public baths (the same applies for Christians who have to wear a wooden cross around their neck in the baths).
;1184–1199: The Almohad Yaqub al-Mansur orders that Jews must dress in Muslim fashion of mourning (dark blue or black). His successor requires Jews to wear yellow cloaks and turbans. 
;1249: The Ayyubid Sultan issues an order according to which the property and life of Jews or Christians which are found on the streets without a distinguishing badge is forfeit.
;1450: The Algerian qadi Muhammad al-Uqbani and the Flemish traveller Anselm Adornes report that Tunisian Jews are obliged to wear a distinctive piece of yellow cloth on their clothing.

===Medieval and early modern Europe===
;1215: The Fourth Council of the Lateran headed by Pope Innocent III declares: &quot;Jews and Saracens of both sexes in every Christian province and at all times shall be marked off in the eyes of the public from other peoples through the character of their dress.&quot;
;1219: Pope Honorius III issues a dispensation to the Jews of Castile. Spanish Jews normally wore turbans in any case, which presumably met the requirement to be distinctive.
;1222: Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton orders English Jews to wear a white band two fingers broad and four fingers long.
;1227: The Synod of Narbonne rules: &quot;That Jews may be distinguished from others, we decree and emphatically command that in the center of the breast (of their garments) they shall wear an oval badge, the measure of one finger in width and one half a palm in height.&quot;
;1228: James I orders Jews of Aragon to wear the badge.
;1265: The &quot;Siete Partidas&quot;, a legal code enacted in Castile by Alfonso X but not implemented until many years later, includes a requirement for Jews to wear distinguishing marks.
;1267: In a special session, the Vienna city council forces Jews to wear &quot;pileum cornutum&quot; (a cone-shaped head dress, common in medieval illustrations of Jews); a badge does not seem to have been worn in Austria.
;1269: France. (Saint) Louis IX of France orders all Jews found in public without a badge ( or , ) to be fined ten livres of silver. The enforcement of wearing the badge is repeated by local councils, with varying degrees of fines, at Arles 1234 and 1260, Béziers 1246, Albi 1254, Nîmes 1284 and 1365, Avignon 1326 and 1337, Rodez 1336, and Vanves 1368.
;1274: The Statute of Jewry in England, enacted by King Edward I, enforces the regulations. &quot;Each Jew, after he is seven years old, shall wear a distinguishing mark on his outer garment, that is to say, in the form of two Tables joined, of yellow felt of the length of six inches and of the breadth of three inches.&quot;
;1294: Erfurt. The earliest mention of the badge in Germany.
;1315–1326: Emir Ismail Abu-I-Walid forces the Jews of Granada to wear the yellow badge.
;1321: Henry II of Castile forces the Jews to wear the yellow badge.
;1415: A bull of the Antipope Benedict XIII orders the Jews to wear a yellow and red badge; the men on their breast, the women on their forehead.
;1434: Emperor Sigismund reintroduces the badge at Augsburg.
;1528: The Council of Ten of Venice allows the newly arrived famous physician and professor Jacob Mantino ben Samuel to wear the regular black doctors&#x27; cap instead of Jewish yellow hat for several months (subsequently made permanent), upon the recommendation of the French and English ambassadors, the papal legate, and other dignitaries numbered among his patients.
;1555: Pope Paul IV decrees, in his &quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot;, that the Jews should wear yellow hats.
;1566: King Sigismund II passes a law that required Lithuanian Jews to wear yellow hats and head coverings. The law was abolished twenty years later.
;1710: Frederick William I abolished the mandatory Jewish yellow patch in Prussia in return for a payment of 8,000 thaler (about $75,000 worth of silver at 2007 prices) each.

===Axis powers===
====1939====
:Local German occupation commanders ordered Jewish Poles to wear an identifying mark under the threat of death. There were no consistent requirements as to its colour and shape: it varies from a white armband, a yellow hat to a yellow Star of David badge. Hans Frank ordered all Jewish Poles over the age of 11 years in German-occupied Poland to wear white armbands with a blue Star of David.

====1940==== 
:A popular legend portrays king Christian X of Denmark wearing the yellow badge on his daily morning horseback ride through the streets of Copenhagen, followed by non-Jewish Danes responding to their king&#x27;s example, thus preventing the Germans from identifying Jewish citizens. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has explained that the story was not true. No order requiring Jews to wear identifying marks was ever introduced in Denmark.

====1941====
:Jews in the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany, were ordered to wear &quot;Jewish insignia&quot;. Jewish Poles in German-occupied Soviet-annexed Poland, Jewish Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians as well as Soviet Jews in German-occupied areas were obliged to wear white armbands or yellow badges. All Romanian Jews were ordered to wear the yellow badge. The yellow badge was the only standardised identifying mark in the German-occupied East; other signs were forbidden. Jewish Germans and Jews with citizenship of annexed states (Austrians, Czechs, Danzigers) from the age of six years were ordered to wear the yellow badge from 19 September when in public. In Luxembourg, the German occupation authorities introduce the Nuremberg Laws, followed by several other anti-Jewish ordinances including an order for all Jews to wear a yellow star with the word &quot;Jude&quot;. The Slovak Republic ordered its Jews to wear yellow badges.

;1941/1942: Romania started to force Jews in newly annexed territories, denied Romanian citizenship, to wear the yellow badge.

====1942====
:The Gestapo ordered Jewish Germans and Jews with citizenship of annexed states to mark their apartments or houses at the front door with a white badge. Jewish Dutch people were ordered to wear the yellow badge. Jewish Belgians were ordered to wear the yellow badge. Jews in occupied France, covering the northern and western half of the country, were ordered to wear a yellow star by the German authorities. Bulgaria ordered its Jewish citizens to wear small yellow buttons. German forces invaded and occupied the &quot;zone libre&quot;, i.e. the south-eastern half of France, but did not enforce the yellow star directive there.

====1944====
:After the occupation of Hungary, the Nazi occupiers ordered Jewish Hungarians and Jews with defunct other citizenships (Czechoslovak, Romanian, Yugoslav) in Hungarian-annexed areas to wear the yellow badge.

<text>Registered mail is a postal service in many countries which allows the sender proof of mailing via a receipt and, upon request, electronic verification that an article was delivered or that a delivery attempt was made. Depending on the country, additional services may also be available, such as:
* a chain of custody, where the posted item has its details recorded in a register to enable its location to be tracked, sometimes with added insurance to cover loss;
*a return receipt, called an avis de réception, which provides a postcard or electronic notification with the date of delivery and recipient signature;
*restricted delivery, which confirms that only a specific person or authorized agent will receive the mail, and;
*certified mail, in the United States.

==Background==
Traditionally, registered mail was a manual process which gave rise to a great variety of distinctive postal markings, like handstamps, and usage of registration labels. Many countries have issued special postal stationery and postage stamps for registered mail. Earlier similar services were known as &quot;Money Letters&quot;. Today, the registration process is largely computerized with barcode registration labels replacing the traditional analog labels having only a printed serial number.

Generally, the item is pre-paid with the normal postage rate and an additional charge known as a &quot;registration fee&quot;. Upon payment of this fee the sender is given a receipt, and (usually) a unique numbered &quot;registration label&quot; is affixed to the letter. As the letter travels from post office to post office and through any sorting office, it has to be signed for on a ledger. This process is completed when the letter is delivered and the receiver signs for the item. With computerization and barcode technology, much of the logging once done manually has become simpler and leads to greater options for the sender and receiver alike to access the status of their shipment via the internet. Many postal authorities provide tracing information for registered items on their website.

Internationally, the use of registered mail requires labels with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding barcode (UPU S10). The first two letters indicate registration (usually &quot;RR&quot;) while the last two letters usually represent the country where the registered item was posted. &quot;E.g.&quot;, RR913282511SG indicating Singapore, RB5584847749CN indicating China or RR123456785KR indicating South Korea.

==History==

The earliest reference to a mail registration system dates to July 1556, during the reign of Mary Tudor, of England. In that example, This was likely for state security rather than mail security. In 1603, another Order of Council was made whereby all letters had to be recorded. This system was, in effect, a registration system, although it applied to all items sent via the post.

William Dockwra&#x27;s 1680s London Penny Post also recorded all details on letters accepted for onward transmission, but unlike the General Post Office, gave compensation for losses.

The registration of letters as known today was introduced in 1841 in Great Britain. The letter had to be enclosed within a large sheet of green paper. The green sheet was addressed to the Post Office where the recipient lived. The green sheet was then used as a receipt and was returned to the office of origin after delivery. On 1 July 1858 the green sheet was replaced by a green silk ribbon and shortly afterward by a green linen tape. In 1870 the tape was replaced by green string. On the introduction of postal stationery registration envelopes in 1878 the string was replaced by printed blue crossed lines. The blue crossed lines have survived on registered letters to the present day. 

==Canada==

Canada Post&#x27;s &quot;Registered Mail&quot; service provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon delivery of the item, with the delivery date and a copy of the signature of the addressee or the addressee&#x27;s representative. Registered Mail may include lettermail, documents, valuables, and literature for the blind, but does not include parcels.

==Israel==

Israel Post&#x27;s &quot;Registered Mail&quot; service (, ) provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon delivery of the item, the addressee must sign in order to obtain the item. The sender can monitor the item until its delivery, for items intended for 84 cities in Israel. A confirmation of delivery is sent to the sender for an additional fee. Registered Mail may include letters, postcards and printed matter.

On 25 November 2015 a preliminary reading of an amendment to Postal Law that forces the sender to mention his name on an item sent via registered mail, was passed. According to the press, the major opposition to this bill is the Courts Administration that sends most of its mail via registered mail with a confirmation of delivery, and claims that knowing the identity of the sender, many of their addressees will choose not to accept the items, thus delaying the legal proceedings they are a party to.

==Sweden==
PostNord&#x27;s service &quot;Registered Mail&quot; (), often shortened as &quot;Rek&quot;, will only be delivered after the recipient have verified their identity with some form of ID card or BankID and had their personal identity number logged. The letter can also be collected by a courier, provided this courier carries both their own ID and the recipient&#x27;s ID, or if the receiver have verified their identy in the app via BankID and sent a newly generated barcode to the courier. All &quot;Registered Mail&quot; is traceable in over 30 countries via PostNord&#x27;s website and mobile app. Any domestic &quot;Registered Mail&quot; is insured for up to 10 000 SEK. International &quot;Registered Mail&quot; is insured for up to either 2 000 SEK or 10 000 SEK.

There is an optional added service called &quot;Personal Delivery&quot; () where only the recipient can collect the letter and denies all else, including couriers and power of attorney. Another optional added service is Advice of Delivery () where a form signed by the receiver is sent back to the sender.

&quot;Registered Mail&quot; will be delivered to one of PostNord&#x27;s service points, often a grocery store, where the identity of the receiver, and any courier, can be verified and logged before handing over the letter.

Since autumn 2017 Postnord no longer requires a signature when delivering registered mail from China Post. Registered mail from China Post is only traceable in the sense that the mailman marks the item as delivered when and if it is delivered to the recipient&#x27;s mailbox. No proof that the recipient has received the mail is collected.

==United Kingdom==
Since 1998, the &quot;Special Delivery&quot; service has been the only registered service offered by Royal Mail, after the old-style &quot;Registered Letter&quot; service was discontinued.

==United States==

Registered mail is offered by the United States Postal Service as an extra for First Class or Priority Mail shipments. It provides end-to-end security in locked containers and its custody records are maintained, but are not normally provided to the customer unless a claim is filed.

Registered mail may be used to send classified material up to the Secret classified level.

===Certified mail===

While not a form of registered mail, certified mail allows the sender proof of mailing via a mailing receipt and, upon request, electronic verification that an article was delivered or that a delivery attempt was made. Some in-transit tracking and delivery confirmation information may be provided, but there is no formal chain of custody. It is restricted to Priority Mail and First Class Mail parcels and letters mailed within the United States and its territories (including APOs and FPOs). Each item is assigned a unique label number which serves as an official record of mailing by the USPS.

Certified mail began in 1955 after the idea was originated by Assistant U.S. Postmaster General Joseph Cooper. Certified mail may be selected for many reasons, not just for important business mailings. It is used by anyone who needs or wishes to provide a tracking number to the receiver as proof of delivery. It can also substitute, essentially, a proof of mailing form when a Postmark and/or scanned receipt is obtained at a Post Office. Contrary to popular belief, Tracking is not accepted as proof of mailing in nearly all legal situations. The service also allows the receiver to track their package/envelope through the online system at usps.com using the unique tracking number provided by the mailer.

Certified mail can be combined with (for an additional fee) or without &quot;return receipt requested&quot; service, often called &quot;RRR.&quot; Standard return receipt requires use of PS Form 3811, which is a green postcard-sized paper: upon delivery, this paper is mailed back to the sender and serves as legal proof of delivery. USPS now offers Return Receipt Electronic (RRE) as an alternative to the traditional mailing back of the PS Form 3811 card. RRE provides electronic proof of delivery information. Many jurisdictions accept this as legal proof of delivery, but a minority do not. With RRE, when the letter reaches its final delivery destination, the letter carrier captures the signature, name and (portion of) address of the person that accepts the letter. The information is electronically stored, making it available to the sender in nearly real-time via an email with attached PDF. As indicated on the return receipt card, either the addressee or the addressee&#x27;s &quot;agent&quot; may sign for the document. Because the process is automated and does not require postage, RRE is cheaper than traditional RRR.

<text>Ramakrishna (18 February 1836 – 16 August 1886), also called Ramakrishna Paramahansa (; ; ), born Ramakrishna Chattopadhay, was an Indian Hindu mystic. He was a devotee of the goddess Kali, but adhered to various religious practices from the Hindu traditions of Vaishnavism, Tantric Shaktism, and Advaita Vedanta, as well as Christianity and Islam. He advocated the essential unity of religions and proclaimed that world religions are &quot;so many paths to reach one and the same goal&quot;. His parable-based teachings espoused the ultimate unity of diverse religions as being means to enable the realization of the same God. He is regarded by his followers as an avatar (divine incarnation).
Born in Kamarpukur, Bengal Presidency, India, Ramakrishna was the fourth and youngest child of his parents. He encountered several religious experiences starting from his childhood, and later began his career, at age twenty, as a temple priest at the Dakshineshwar Kali Temple in Calcutta. The devotional temperament of Ramakrishna coupled with his intense religious practices at the temple premises led him to experience various spiritual visions. Soon a few religious teachers visited Ramakrishna and assured him the sanctity of his visions. In 1859, in accordance with then prevailing customs, Ramakrishna was married to Sarada Devi, a marriage that was never consummated.

Tota Puri, a vedanta monk, initiated Ramakrishna into sannyasa in 1865. Ramakrishna later gained widespread acclaim amongst the temple visiting public as a guru, attracting to him social leaders, elites, and common people alike. Although initially reluctant to consider himself a guru, he eventually taught his disciples and founded the monastic Ramakrishna Order. Ramakrishna died due to throat cancer on the night of 15 August 1886. After his demise, his chief disciple Swami Vivekananda popularized his ideas in India and the West.

==Early life==
=== Birth and childhood ===
Ramakrishna was born on 18 February 1836, in the village of Kamarpukur, in the Hooghly district of West Bengal, India, in a very poor and pious Bengali Brahmin family. He was the fourth and the youngest child of his parents, father Khudiram Chattopadhyaya, born in 1775, and mother Chandramani Devi, born in 1791. The couple&#x27;s first son Ramkumar is said to have been born in 1805, a daughter Katyayani five years later, and a second son Rameswar in 1826.

Chandramani Devi was Khudiram&#x27;s second wife. His first wife died young. Khudiram had ancestral property in the Dere Village of present day West Bengal, India. An unscrupulous landlord, Ramananda Roy, who was angry with Khudiram for refusing to commit perjury, brought a false petition against him in the court and took possession of his ancestral property. Bereft of all property, Khudiram and Chandramani Devi moved to Kamarpukur where a friend, Sukhlal Goswami, gifted them one Bigha and ten Chataks of land for their maintenance.

The parents of Ramakrishna are said to have experienced supernatural incidents and visions regarding his birth. In Gaya, his father Khudiram had a dream in which Bhagavan Gadadhara (a form of lord Vishnu) told him that he would be born as his son. Chandramani Devi is said to have had a vision of light entering her womb from the lingam in Yogider Shiv mandir. In another vision following Ramakrishna&#x27;s birth, his mother saw a strange tall person lying in the bed instead of the baby Ramakrishna.

The family was devoted to the Hindu deity Rama, the family deity was Sri Raghubiran epithet of Rama, and the male children of Khudiram and Chandramani were given names that started with Ram or Rama: Ramkumar, Rameswar, and Ramakrishna. There has been some dispute about the origin of the name Ramakrishna, but there is &quot;...evidence which proves beyond doubt that the name &#x27;Ramakrishna&#x27; was given to him by his father...&quot; Ramakrishna confirmed this himself, as recorded in &quot;M&quot;s diaries, &quot;I was a pet child of my father. He used to call me Ramakrishnababu.&quot;

=== First spiritual experience ===
Around the age of six or seven, Ramakrishna experienced his first moment of spiritual trance. One morning while walking along the narrow ridges of a paddy field, eating some puffed rice from a small basket, he came across the sight of a flock of milky white cranes flying against the backdrop of a heavy rain laden black clouds, which soon engulfed the entire sky. The ensuing sight was so beautiful that he was absorbed into it and lost all his outer consciousness, before falling down with the rice scattered all over. People nearby who saw this came to his rescue and carried him home.

At age nine, in accordance with Brahminical tradition, the sacred thread was vested on Ramakrishna, thus making him eligible for conducting ritual worship. He would later help his family in performing worship of their deities. As a result of his devotion in worship, he started to experience Bhava-Samadhi or Savikalpa-Samadhi. He reportedly had experiences of similar nature a few other times in his childhoodwhile worshipping the Goddess Vishalakshi, and portraying the God Shiva in a drama during the Shivaratri festival.

=== Education ===
Ramakrishna was sent to the village school where he learned to read and write, but had an aversion towards arithmetic and didn&#x27;t progress beyond simple addition, multiplication and division. He read the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and other religious books with devotion. He observed the scholars and found that they were only interested in acquiring wealth and contrasted this with his father&#x27;s standards of detachment and righteous conduct. He later lost interest in this &quot;bread-winning education&quot;. He instead became proficient in making images, acting and painting. When he was fourteen years old, he started a drama group with some of his friends and left school to pursue it. Ramakrishna had practically no formal education and spoke ungrammatical imperfect Bengali with a rustic accent.

Kamarpukur, being a transit-point on the well-established pilgrimage routes to Puri, brought Ramakrishna into contact with many renunciate saints and holy men. He became well-versed in the &quot;Puranas&quot;, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, hearing them from the wandering monks and the &quot;Kathaks&quot;a class of men in ancient India who preached and sang the &quot;Purāṇas&quot;. He used to sing and enact the songs and scenes from the &quot;Purāṇas&quot; to the village women. A trader, Durgadas Pyne, who enforced a strict purdah on the women in his household, criticised those who would meet Ramakrishna to listen to the &quot;Purāṇas&quot;. Ramakrishna argued with him that women will be protected through good education and devotion to God, and not through Purdah. Once a challenge was thrown by Durgadas that it was impossible to look into his inner apartments, Ramakrishna accepted the challenge and dressed himself like a weaver woman, then fooled Durgadas with his disguise and entered the inner apartments of his house. Durgadas, defeated, allowed the women to go and listen to Ramakrishna&#x27;s recitals.

Ramakrishna&#x27;s father died in 1843, a loss which he felt very strongly and made him reticent. He would visit the nearby cremation ground alone to practice spiritual disciplines there. At this stage the family responsibilities fell on his elder brother, Ramkumar, who was about thirty-one years older than him. When Ramakrishna was in his teens, the family&#x27;s financial position worsened, Ramkumar then started a Sanskrit school in Calcutta (Jhama pukur lane), whilst also serving as a priest there. In 1852, Ramakrishna moved to Calcutta along with his brother to assist him with the priestly work.

==Priesthood and marriage==
=== Lead up to priesthood ===
In the 19th century Calcutta, there lived Rani Rasmani, a wealthy woman with a commanding personality. A widow with four daughters, she was the first of the many prominent women who played a major role in the life of Ramakrishna. Inheriting property from her husband, the Rani managed to endear herself to the people of the city through her exceptional managerial skills of the estate, her resistance against the British colonial authorities, and her various philanthropic works. Known well for her kindness, benevolence to the poor, and also for her religious devotion, she was much loved and revered by the people and proved herself to be worthy of the title &quot;Rani&quot;. Being an ardent devotee of the Goddess Kali, the Rani had the words, &quot;Sri Rasmani Dasi, longing for the Feet of Kali”, inscribed in her estates official seal. After having a vision of the Goddess Kali in a dream on the night before her departure for a pilgrimage to the Hindu holy city of Kashi, she founded the now famous Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Reportedly in the dream, the goddess instructed her that instead of visiting Kashi she better set up a stone idol of the Goddess at a beautiful place on the banks of the Bhagirathi River, and make arrangements for the daily worship and prasada offering there, then she would manifest in the deity and receive her worship.

With great delight the Rani bought a large piece of land on the banks of Hooghly river at Dakshineswar and started the construction of a nine-spired temple where pilgrims could congregate to catch a glimpse of the Goddess. However for being born into a &quot;Cāsi kaivarta&quot; family, she was deemed unworthy by the local Brahmins to make food offerings to Kali. It was her heart&#x27;s desire to offer prasada to Kali, and if she did so going against the norms of the Brahmanical society of the time, the devotees would no longer visit that temple, nor would a Brahmin priest officiate there. To find a scriptural solution to her problem, the Rani sought written opinions of various pandits from different parts of the country. However, none of the opinions were in her favor. When all hope was seemingly lost, she received a letter from Ramkumar, who assured her that the scriptural principles would be observed intact if she made a gift of the property to a Brahmin, who could then install the deity and make arrangements for food offerings. No blemish would then be incurred by those who partook the prasada there. She readily agreed to these conditions, displaying savviness in working around the rigidities of caste while adhering to its restrictions.

The Rani thus decided to consecrate the temple and proceeded with her plans. While the search for a priest was on, a Brahmin named Mahesh Chandra Chattopadhyaya who worked on the estate of the Rani, and her secretary Ramdhan Ghosh, both of whom were well acquainted with Ramkumar, requested him to officiate as a priest at the temple of the Rani, albeit temporarily.
The devout Ramkumar agreed and later after the opening of the temple on the last day of May in 1855, on request by the Rani, he continued as its chief priest.

Ramkumar informed Ramakrishna that he was taking up the post of the priest and asked him to stay at the Kali Temple. At this injunction Ramakrishna strenuously objected and reminded Ramkumar that their father never officiated in the ceremonies of the purported &#x27;lower castes&#x27; and refused to join him, but the will of Ramkumar prevailed in this matter.

=== Officiation as priest ===
On Thursday, 31 May 1855, Ramkumar in the presence of his brother Ramakrishna officiated at the dedication ceremony of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Despite having Brahmanical authority since its beginning, this temple remained accessible to all irrespective of caste, creed, and class.

Within three months after the consecration of the temple, Mathur Babu, the Rani&#x27;s right-hand man was much impressed by Ramakrishna and appointed him with the task of dressing up the deity of Kali, and Hriday, the sixteen year old nephew of Ramakrishna was appointed as an assistant to both him and Ramkumar. Soon, Ramkumar began to teach his brother the modes of worship and service of the Goddess, in the hope that he might perform them in his absence. To initiate him properly, a Sadhaka of Shakti named Kenaram Bhattacharya was invited. He was apparently charmed to see the religious fervor in Ramakrishna, who reportedly became ecstatic as soon as a mantra was recited in his ear. In order to get him more accustomed, Ramkumar later employed Ramakrishna on few occasions to perform the worship of Kali.

As Ramkumar grew old and infirm to carry out the difficult duties at the Kali temple, Mathur with the permission of the Rani, requested him to move to the Vishnu temple in the complex for conducting worship, and appointed Ramakrishna to the office of priest. Ramkumar was glad with this arrangement, and after serving for one year since the consecration of the temple, he died suddenly in 1856 while preparing to go home on a leave.

=== Vision of the Goddess Kali ===
At age 20, Ramakrishna who by now had witnessed more than one death in his family, realising the utter impermanence of life, became more engrossed in the worship of Kali. After the daily worship, he would sit in the temple looking intently at the deity and get absorbed in her, before losing himself in devotion whilst singing with profound emotion the songs composed by devotees like Ramprasad and Kamalakanta. He regarded their songs as an aid in his worship, and was certain about having the vision of Kali as Ramprasad did. With an ardent heart, he would say, &quot;Thou showed thyself to Ramprasad, Mother, why then shouldst Thou not reveal Thyself to me? I don&#x27;t want wealth, friends, relatives, enjoyment of pleasure, and the like. Do show Thyself to me.&quot; Being averse to wasting any time, after the closure of the temple during midday or at night, he would visit the nearby jungle to think and meditate on Kali.

Before meditating, he would put down his clothes and the sacred thread aside, and meditate completely naked. When Hriday found this out, he confronted his uncle and asked him to explain his strange conduct. Ramakrishna answered that when one thinks about God, one should be free from all attachments and the eight servitudes of &quot;hatred, fear, shame, aversion, egoism, vanity, noble descent, and good conduct.&quot; He viewed his sacred thread as a display of the ego of his Brahmin descent and thus kept it aside, saying when calling upon the Mother, one should discard all such bondages and call on Her with a focused mind. He assured his nephew that he would put them on after the end of his meditation. Hriday was aghast at hearing this and left him in dismay.

In this way, Ramakrishna spent his days and nights altogether in prayer, singing, and meditation while his longing for her vision kept increasing daily. It was not long before people around the temple started noticing his passion and adherence to devotion, which was quite unperturbed by the opinions of people around him. The Rani was informed by her son-in-law Mathur thus: &quot;We have got an extraordinary worshipper; the Goddess will be awakened very soon&quot;.

As the days passed, Ramakrishna&#x27;s food intake and sleep gradually declined and when not engaged in either worship or meditation, he was seen in a state of turmoil over whether he would get a vision of the Mother. Seeing the evening sun, he would cry, &quot;Mother, another day is gone and still I have not seen you!&quot; Eventually he would question, &quot;Are you true, Mother, or is it all a fabrication of my mind, mere poetry without reality? If you do exist, why can&#x27;t I see you?&quot;

Soon his longing for her vision became extreme and he was engaged in either worship or meditation for almost twenty-four hours a day. Despaired, and feeling an unbearable pain at the thought that he might never have her vision, one day, as he later recounted: &quot;In my agony, I said to myself, &#x27;What is the use of this life?&#x27; Suddenly my eyes fell on the sword that hangs in the temple. I decided to end my life with it then and there. Like a madman, I ran to it and seized it. And then — I had a marvellous vision of the Mother and fell down unconscious.&quot; He became overwhelmed and before fainting, observed that to his spiritual sight, houses, doors, temples and everything else around vanishing into an empty void and &quot;What I saw, was a boundless infinite conscious sea of light! However far and in whatever direction I looked, I found a continuous succession of effulgent waves coming forward, raging and storming from all sides with great speed. Very soon they fell on me and made me sink to the unknown bottom. I panted, struggled and fell unconscious. I did not know what happened then in the external world — how that day and the next slipped away. But, in my
heart of hearts, there was flowing a current of intense bliss, never experienced before, and I had the immediate knowledge of the light that was Mother.&quot; When he regained consciousness, he was found uttering the word &quot;&quot;Maa&quot; (Mother) repeatedly in an aching voice.
Thoroughly convinced of Kali&#x27;s existence, Ramakrishna now lived at her abode, all the time, and like a child disinclined to leave its mother, so was he disinclined to leave his Divine Mother Kali. Hovering in an ocean of bliss he guided various seekers to Kali, realising one cannot experience it anywhere but from Her. When asked why he called the deity a &quot;Mother&quot;&quot;, he answered that it was because the child is most free with the Mother, and she alone can cherish the child more than anyone else. People around him noted that he engaged in talks of spiritual matters only and never about any worldly issues, and while talking about Kali the Divine Mother, he would simply cry and be elated. When someone once asked him about Kali worship, he said:
&quot;I do not worship Kali made of clay and straw. My Mother is the conscious principle. My Mother is pure Satchidananda — Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. That which is infinite and deep is always dark-coloured. The extensive sky is dark-coloured and so is the deep sea. My Kali is infinite, all-pervading, and consciousness itself.&quot;
===Marriage===

Rumors spread to Kamarpukur that Ramakrishna became unstable as a result of his spiritual practices at Dakshineswar. Ramakrishna&#x27;s mother and his elder brother Rameswar decided to get Ramakrishna married, thinking that marriage would be a good steadying influence upon him by forcing him to take up responsibilities, and keep his attention on normal affairs rather than on his spiritual practices and visions. Ramakrishna himself mentioned that they would find the bride at the house of Ramchandra Mukherjee in Jayrambati, three miles to the north-west of Kamarpukur. The five-year-old bride, Saradamani Mukhopadhyaya (later known as Sarada Devi; she is also considered an avatar) was found, and the marriage was duly solemnised in 1859. Ramakrishna was twenty-three at this point, but this age difference for marriage was typical for nineteenth-century rural Bengal. They later spent three months together in Kamarpukur when Sarada Devi was fourteen, and Ramakrishna thirty-two. Ramakrishna became a very influential figure in Sarada&#x27;s life, and she became a strong follower of his teachings. After the marriage, Sarada stayed at Jayrambati and joined Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar at the age of eighteen.

By the time his bride joined him, Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life of a sannyasi, and the marriage was never consummated.

Once as a part of practicing the spiritual mood called &quot;mādhurā bhavā sādhana&quot;, Ramakrishna dressed and behaved as a woman. Disciple Mahendranath Gupta quoted the Master as follows:How can a man conquer passion? He should assume the attitude of a woman. I spent many days as the handmaid of God. I dressed myself in women&#x27;s clothes, put on ornaments and covered the upper part of my body with a scarf, just like a woman. With the scarf on, I used to perform the evening worship before the image. Otherwise, how could I have kept my wife with me for eight months? Both of us behaved as if we were the handmaid of the Divine Mother.

As a priest, Ramakrishna performed the ritual ceremony of the &quot;Shodashi Puja&quot; in his room, where he worshipped his wife Sarada Devi as the &quot;Divine Mother&quot; herself. Ramakrishna regarded Sarada Devi as the Divine Mother in person, addressing her as the Holy Mother, and it was by this name that she became known to Ramakrishna&#x27;s disciples. Sarada Devi outlived Ramakrishna by thirty-four years and played an important role in the development of the nascent religious movement.

==God-realization via various traditions==
In 1860, Ramakrishna returned to Dakshineswar and was again caught up in a spiritual tempest forgetting his wife, home, body, and surroundings. He once described his experiences during this most tumultuous period of his life thus:
&quot;No sooner had I passed through one spiritual crisis than another took its place. It was like being in the midst of a whirlwind, even my sacred thread was blown away. I could seldom keep hold of my dhoti [cloth]. Sometimes I would open my mouth, and it would be as if my jaws reached from heaven to the underworld. &quot;Mother!&quot; I would cry desperately. I felt I had to pull her in, as a fisherman pulls in fish with his dragnet. A prostitute walking the street would appear to me to be Sita, going to meet her victorious husband. An English boy standing cross-legged against a tree reminded me of the boy Krishna, and I lost consciousness. Sometimes I would share my food with a dog. My hair became matted. Birds would perch on my head and peck at the grains of rice which had lodged there during the worship. Snakes would crawl over my motionless body. An ordinary man couldn&#x27;t have borne a quarter of that tremendous fervour; it would have burnt him up. I had no sleep at all for six long years. My eyes lost the power of winking. I stood in front of a mirror and tried to close my eyelids with my finger and I couldn&#x27;t! I got frightened and said to Mother: &quot;Mother, is this what happens to those who call on you? I surrendered myself to you, and you gave me this terrible disease!&quot; I used to shed tears — but then, suddenly, I&#x27;d be filled with ecstasy. I saw that my body didn&#x27;t matter — it was of no importance, a mere trifle. Mother appeared to me and comforted me and freed me from my fear.&quot;
Ramakrishna grew up practicing Bhakti towards Lord Rama, and his duties as a priest at the Dakshineswar temple led him to practice worship of the Mother Kali. While serving as a temple priest at Dakshineswar, Ramakrishna would encounter various itinerant sadhus who would visit his place and stay there for a while. Practicing their own modes of worship, several of them initiated Ramakrishna into various schools of Hinduism.
In the year 1861, a female ascetic named Bhairavi Brahmani, initiated Ramakrishna into Tantra. Afterwards, he took up the practise of vatsalya bhava (attitude of a Parent towards the divine child) under a Vaishnava guru named Jatadhari. In 1865, a Vedanta monk named Tota Puri, initiated Ramakrishna into sannyasa and he attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi, considered as culmination of spiritual practices. In 1866, Govinda Roy, a Hindu guru who practised Sufism, initiated Ramakrishna into Islam, further in 1873, Ramakrishna practiced Christianity and had the Bible read to him.

After more than a decade of sadhana in various religious paths, each culminating in the realization of God by that path, his personal practices settled, and he is said to have remained in bhavamukha, a level of blissful samadhi. He would meditate in the Panchavati (a wooded and secluded area of the Dakshineswar Temple grounds), go to the Kali temple to offer flowers to the Mother, and wave incense to the assorted deities and religious figures, whose pictures hung in his room.

===Rama Bhakti===
At some point in the period between his vision of Kali and his marriage, Ramakrishna practised &quot;dāsya bhāva&quot;, during which he worshiped Rama with the attitude of Hanuman, who is considered to be the ideal devotee and servant of Rama. According to Ramakrishna, towards the end of this &quot;sadhana&quot;, he had a vision of Sita, the consort of Rama, merging into his body.

Bhairavi Brahmani, an ascetic who used to carry with her the &quot;Raghuvir Shila&quot; - a stone idol representing lord Rama and all Vaishnava deities, who is also well versed in the texts of Gaudiya Vaishnavism stated that Ramakrishna was experiencing a phenomenon that accompanies &quot;mahabhava&quot;, the supreme attitude of loving devotion towards the divine, and quoting from the &quot;bhakti shastras&quot;, she stated that other religious figures like Radha and Chaitanya had similar experiences.

===Tantra===
Tantra focuses on the worship of &quot;shakti&quot; and the object of tantric training is to transcend the barriers between the holy and unholy as a means of achieving liberation and to see all aspects of the natural world as manifestations of the divine &quot;shakti&quot;.

In the year 1861, an itinerant middle-aged female ascetic named Bhairavi Brahmani initiated Ramakrishna into Tantra. Under her guidance, Ramakrishna went through sixty-four major tantric sadhanas which were completed in 1863. For all the sixty-four sadhana, he took only three days each to complete. He began with mantra rituals such as japa and purascarana and many other rituals designed to purify the mind and establish self-control. He later proceeded towards tantric sadhanas, which generally include a set of heterodox practices called &quot;vamachara&quot; (left-hand path), which utilise as a means of liberation, activities like eating of parched grain, fish and meat along with drinking of wine and sexual intercourse. According to Ramakrishna and his biographers, Ramakrishna did not directly participate in the last two of those activities (some even say he didn&#x27;t indulge in meat eating), all that he needed was a suggestion of them to produce the desired result. Ramakrishna acknowledged the left-hand tantric path, though it had &quot;undesirable features&quot;, as one of the &quot;valid roads to God-realization&quot;, he consistently cautioned his devotees and disciples against associating with it.

The Bhairavi also taught Ramakrishna the &quot;kumari-puja&quot;, a form of ritual in which the Virgin Goddess is worshipped symbolically in the form of a young girl. Under the tutelage of the Bhairavi, Ramakrishna also learnt Kundalini Yoga. The Bhairavi, with the yogic techniques and the tantra, played an important part in the initial spiritual development of Ramakrishna.

===Vaishnava Bhakti===
In 1864, Ramakrishna practised &quot;vātsalya bhāva&quot; under a Vaishnava guru Jatadhari. During this period, he worshipped a small metal image of Ramlālā (Rama as a child) in the attitude of a mother. According to Ramakrishna, he could feel the presence of child Rama as a living God in the metal image.

Ramakrishna later engaged in the practice of &quot;madhura bhāva&quot;, the attitude of the Gopis and Radha towards Krishna. During the practise of this &quot;bhava&quot;, Ramakrishna dressed himself in women&#x27;s attire for several days and regarded himself as one of the gopis of Vrindavan. According to Ramakrishna, &quot;madhura bhava&quot; is one of the ways to root out the idea of sex, which is seen as an impediment in spiritual life. According to Ramakrishna, towards the end of this &quot;sadhana&quot;, he attained &quot;savikalpa samadhi&quot; (god seen with form and qualities)—vision and union with Krishna.

Ramakrishna visited Nadia, the home of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu, the fifteenth-century founders of Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava bhakti. According to Ramakrishna, he had an intense vision of two young boys merging into his body while he was crossing the river in a boat. Earlier, after his vision of Kali, he is said to have cultivated the &quot;Santa bhava&quot;—the child attitude – towards Kali.

===Tota Puri and Vedanta===
Towards the end of 1864, an itinerant monk named Tota Puri, a tall naked mendicant with tangled hair; a Naga sadhu of Mahanirvani Akhara, born probably in Punjab, arrived at Dakshineswar while on a pilgrimage through various holy sites in India. He was the head of a monastery and claimed leadership over seven hundred sannyasis. These sannyasis are renowned to be the knowers of Brahman, and as beings who are thoroughly satisfied in themselves. They see the whole universe as Brahman and its manifestation through Maya. They are always on move, traveling to different pilgrimage places, visiting various temples and meeting holy people in order to experience Brahman there. Tota Puri was one such man who was on a similar visit when he arrived at Dakshineswar. It was a traditional convention with him to not spend more than three days at any one place, and arrived at the Kali temple expecting to spend only three days there.

====Initial meeting====
Arriving at the temple ghat, Tota Puri had a glimpse of the devotional face of Ramakrishna, and stepped up to him wondering if he can be a fit aspirant for learning Vedanta in Bengal, a province which was then saturated with Tantra. After observing Ramakrishna rigorously, he asked him on his own volition if he was interested in practicing any Vedantic disciplines. Ramakrishna replied, &quot;I know nothing of what I should do or not; my Mother knows everything; I shall do as She commands.&quot; A startled Tota told him to go ask your mother then, at which Ramakrishna silently went into the temple and returned ecstatically with a joyful face and informed that his Mother said, &quot;Go and learn; it is in order to teach you that the monk came here.&quot; Being aware that whom Ramakrishna was referring to as his Mother was the idol in the temple, Tota though fascinated at this childlike simplicity, opined his behaviour was due to ignorance and false beliefs. Being a learned man and of sharp intellect, Tota had no regard for any deity except for the Ishvara of Vedanta. He looked upon the Devi as a delusional figure and had no belief in her existence, much less worshipping or propitiating Her. However, he did not say anything about this to Ramakrishna as he felt his impressions of mind would anyway pass away once initiated into sannyasa.

====Initiation into sannyasa====
At the Panchavati, situated to the north of the temple garden, Ramakrishna was initiated into sannyasa by Tota Puri. At the dawn of morning in the auspicious moment of Brahmamuhurtha, with the Homa fire lighted, he was guided through the various rites and ceremonies involved in the procedure of becoming a Sannyasi. In accordance with the scriptural injunctions and tradition of successive generations, he offered as an oblation; to be free from the desire of having spouse, children, wealth, admiration from people, beautiful body and so on, and renounced them all. He then also offered his sacred thread and the tuft of hair on his head as part of the oblation. A pair of Kaupinas (cloth-covering worn over the privities) and an ochre cloth were then presented by the guru Tota to the sadhaka Ramakrishna, who was then instructed by Tota thus:

&quot;Brahman, the one substance which alone is eternally pure, eternally awakened, unlimited by time, space and causation, is absolutely real. Through Maya, which makes the impossible possible, It causes, by virtue of its influence, to seem that It is divided into names and forms. Brahman is never really so divided. For, at the time of Samadhi, not even a drop, so to say, of time and space, and name and form produced by Maya is perceived. Whatever, therefore, is within the bounds of name and form can never be absolutely real. Shun it by a good distance. Break the firm cage of name and form with the overpowering strength of a lion and come out of it. Dive deep into the reality of the Self existing in yourself. Be one with It with the help of Samadhi. You will then see the universe consisting of name and form, vanish, as it were, into the void; you will see the consciousness of the little I merge in that of the immense I, where it ceases to function; and you will have the immediate knowledge of the indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss as yourself.&quot; 

====Experience of samadhi====
Quoting scriptures, Tota explained to his disciple the need to attain the non-dual consciousness as it alone can provide a person the supreme bliss. He tried to enable his disciple to experience the gains from his lifelong sadhana right on that day, and attempted to make him attain Samadhi. He asked his disciple to free his mind from all functions, and merge it in the meditation of the Self. It so came to pass that when Ramakrishna sat for meditation, he could by no means make his mind stop from functioning. He would withdraw his mind easily from everything, but as soon as he did so, the intimately familiar form of the divine Mother, made up of pure consciousness, would appear before him as a living and moving being, making him unmindful of renunciation. Every time he sat for meditation, this happened all over again, and becoming nearly hopeless, he said to his guru, &quot;No, it cannot be done; I cannot make the mind free from functioning and force it to dive into the Self.&quot; Criticizing his disciple very harshly for his defiance, Tota, now feverishly went about searching in the hut. After finding a broken piece of glass, he took it into his hand and forcibly pierced its needlelike pointed end on his disciple&#x27;s forehead between the eyebrows and said, &quot;Collect the mind here to this point With a firm determination.&quot; Ramakrishna, now determined, sat for meditation, and when as previously the form of the divine Mother appeared before his mind, he immediately cut her mentally into two with the sword of knowledge. According to Ramakrishna, there remained then &quot;no function in the mind, which transcended quickly the realm of names and forms, making me merge in Samadhi.&quot;

After being around for a long time near his disciple who&#x27;s now merged into Samadhi, Tota came out of the hut and locked its door lest someone may enter. Taking his seat outside under the Panchavati, he awaited a call to open the door. Days passed by and nights rolled on and at the end of three days when there was no call, surprised and curious, he entered the hut and found Ramakrishna sitting in the exact same posture in which he left him, with no sign of breath whatsoever and face calm and radiant. Highly versed in the phenomena of Samadhi, Tota was astonished and thought, &quot;Is it indeed true, what I see enacted before me? Has this great soul actually realized in a day what I could experience only as the fruit of forty years of austere Sadhana?&quot; In disbelief, he now began to examine and inspect in detail, all the signs manifested in the body of Ramakrishna. He particularly examined if his heart was beating and whether there was the smallest amount of breath coming out through his nostrils. He touched and checked his body, which was now in a firm posture like a piece of fixed wood. Seeing no signs of change, nor any return of normal consciousness, Tota, brimming with joy and awe, exclaimed, &quot;Is it in truth Samadhi? Is it the Nirvikalpa Samadhi, the ultimate result attained through the path of knowledge spoken of in the Vedanta? Ah, how very strange is the Maya of the Divine.&quot; He then began the process of bringing back his disciple to normal consciousness by chanting out loud the Mantra, &quot;Hari Aum&quot;, the sound of which reverberated the entire space around Panchavati.

====Maya and the Divine Mother====
After the experience of Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Ramakrishna realized that the great weaver of Maya is none other than Kali, the Divine Mother herself; that she projects it by Her will like a spider that spins a web out of itself, and She can no more be differentiated from Brahman than can the power of burning from fire. Observing Maya as a majestic and enigmatic statement of divinity, he was filled with reverence and love for it, unlike with disdain seen in other realised souls.

He observed that Maya functions in the world in two ways and named them as &quot;Avidya Maya&quot; and &quot;Vidya Maya&quot;. Considering Avidya Maya to be represented by the lower forces like evil, greed, cruelty etc., which consign a man to the lower level of existence, and Vidya Maya to be represented by the higher forces like kindness, love and devotion, which elevate a man to the higher levels of existence, Ramakrishna felt that when an individual with the help of Vidya Maya could rid himself of Avidya Maya he would become &quot;Mayatita&quot; or free of Maya. He realised these two facets of Maya to be the two forces of creation, the two powers of KaliWho stands beyond both of them, like the beaming sun behind the clouds of different colours and patterns, and shines through them all. Instead of looking upon the world as an illusion created by Brahman as per Vedanta, Ramakrishna looked upon it as the manifestation of the Divine Mother.

He further elaborated his view on the Brahman of Vedanta and the Divine Mother of Tantra thus:

&quot;When I think of the Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying - I call Him Brahman or Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active - creating, preserving, and destroying - I call Him Sakti or Maya or Prakriti, the Personal God. But the distinction between them does not mean a difference. The Personal and the Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one.&quot;

====Tota Puri humbled====
Having seen the rapid progress of Ramakrishna in the Vedantic path, Tota Puri now started to have many serious discussions with him over devotion to the Divine Mother and the Vedantic Brahman. During the course of one such lively discussion, a servant of the temple garden visited them and took a piece of charcoal from the pit of the sacred Dhuni fire, which was then lit by the great ascetic himself to light his own tobacco. At this instance of the unholy act by the servant, Tota flew into rage and began to threaten the man severely; Ramakrishna, who was sitting aside and seeing all this fell onto the ground, rolling in laughter, and remarked how powerful the influence of Maya is over the behaviour of Tota, who was until then talking about how all people are manifestations of Brahman, but forgot everything and got angry at that servant. Tota, feeling embarrassed, vowed never to be angry again. Ramakrishna would go on to say, &quot;Caught in the net of five elements, Brahman weeps&quot; and that no amount of self-knowledge will make the life of a man better until the grace of God is bestowed on him through the power of Maya.

After staying in the Bengal Province for a while, Tota Puri, who until then had never had any illness in his life caught dysentery, which made his life quite miserable. Thinking about taking his leave and moving away, he approached Ramakrishna but every time he did so he would either forget to mention it, or would feel prevented from speaking about it by someone within him, and then would go back hesitantly. Seeing his frail body and knowing about his condition, Ramakrishna with help of Mathur arranged for a special diet and medicines, all to no avail. Being well versed in Meditation, Tota Puri used to merge his mind into Samadhi at will and thus avoid feeling the pain in his body. However, on one night the pain in his intestines became so intense that his mind was no longer able to merge in Samadhi, and he decided to drown his &quot;cage of bones and flesh&quot; in the river Ganga and be free from the consciousness of having body. He thus set out and on reaching a bank of the river, started walking into it and kept walking further, all the way to almost the other side of the bank. Baffled that there seemed to be not enough water in the river to drown himself, he looked back and found, in one dazzling vision, the sight of the divine Mother, the one beyond Turiya, filling up all the space round him. Feeling awe, and realising that the Brahman he had been worshipping all his life was none other than the divine Mother herself, with a grateful heart he turned back, and spent the remaining night meditating on the divine Mother near the dhuni under Panchavati.

When Ramakrishna met Tota in the morning to enquire about his health, he was found a totally different person with no more illness. Reflecting on how imprudent he was to not accept the divine Mother, Tota explained to him the events that transpired the night before, and that by the grace of the Mother, he was now free from his disease. Ramakrishna, with a smile said, &quot;Well, you did not accept the Mother before and argued with me saying that Shakti was unreal! But you have now seen Her yourself and direct experience has got the better of your arguments. She has convinced me already of the fact that just as fire and its burning power are not different, so, Brahman and the power of Brahman are not different, but one and the same.&quot; Tota then asked Ramakrishna to exhort Her to give him permission to leave, as he now realised that it was Her will that he, who had never spent more than three days at a place, had spent eleven months there. Both of them then visited the temple and Tota, who until then considered the image of the Devi to be a delusion, prostrated himself in front of her idol along with Ramakrishna. A few days later, he took leave and left Dakshineswar. It was his first and the last visit to that place.

===Perception in samadhi===
Some time after the departure of Tota Puri from Dakshineswar, Ramakrishna owing to his lack of any restraining elements or desires in the world, decided to dwell in the plane of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. As he attempted to do so, once again the form of the divine Mother, &quot;beautiful, more beautiful than the most&quot;, started to appear in front of his mind, and he not having the heart to leave her behind and go ahead, would return. After much internal deliberation, with great courage, Ramakrishna again, while meditating, took up knowledge as the sword and cut her form into two, and then &quot;there was nothing left in the mind then; and it rushed quickly up to the complete Nirvikalapa state.&quot;

Ramakrishna remained in the Nirvikalapa state continually for a period of six months, a state of perception said to be from which no ordinary person returns back, as the body would then fall dead after twenty-one days, like a dry leaf from a tree. He remained unconscious of the outer world throughout this period, and stayed put like a dead man with matted hair and flies moving through his mouth and nostrils. He might have passed away then if not for the untiring efforts of an unknown monk who happened to be present in Dakshineswar at the time, and who on recognising the state in which Ramakrishna was, thought his body must be kept alive for the betterment of the world as the work of the Mother is still to be done with it, and made attempts every day to bring it back to awareness by beating him with a stick, and feed him in the resulting fleeting moments of consciousness, which though appeared very rarely for a few moments on some days. This period of being in the Nirvikalapa state came to an end after Ramakrishna received a command from the Mother to remain in Bhava Mukha, a state of consciousness bordering between being absorbed into the absolute and remaining in the relative world, for the sake of enlightening people. This was followed by him having an affliction with a severe bout of dysentery. After suffering intense pain in the intestines continually for about six months, his mind gradually returned to the normal plane of consciousness, before that it used to rise and be fixated at the Nirvikalpa state every now and then.

Ramakrishna then firmed his awareness at the sixth chakra of Tantra, and lived with his consciousness oscillating between being either absorbed into the impersonal absolute or remain in personal devotion to the Mother. Later in his life, it was observed that while talking about or listening to subjects related to God, Ramakrishna with his face beaming a smile and body turning radiant, would become noticeably stiff and unconscious. When one of his disciples asked him why does it happen so and what does he experience in that state? Ramakrishna smiled and replied: 
&quot;Well, it is called samadhi, the culmination of meditation. I borrow one-sixteenth part of the mind from the Divine Mother and talk and laugh with you, but the remaining portion rests with the Mother, meditating on her real essence as Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. When I talk or hear about the Mother, the whole mind goes to the Absolute and samadhi immediately ensues. Do you know what samadhi really is? It is complete absorption in Brahman. Do you know how I feel at that time? Suppose there is a basin of water on the seashore and a fish is confined in it. If the basin is accidentally broken, the fish finds its way to the unfathomable ocean. It then frolics in the height of joy, doesn&#x27;t it? Similarly, during samadhi my mind leaps out of this body, as it were, and plunges into Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Hence the body appears like that. In other words, there is no body-consciousness, and the soul merges in the higher Self — the Paramatman — in the thousand-petalled lotus of the head and experiences unspeakable bliss. That experience sends a wave of divine bliss to the face, and the body becomes radiant. This very self then becomes Shiva, the Absolute.&quot;

The periods of Samadhi would later become a regular part in the life of Ramakrishna, and people near him used to find him in a state of Samadhi every now and then, sometimes for almost twenty four hours a day. Once a government official found him remaining in a state of ecstasy for three days and three nights straight. When found deeply absorbed in Samadhi for a long period of time, his devotees would rub cow ghee, on his spine from neck to the lower back, and on knees down to the soles of his feet, pulling in a downward direction, so as to bring him back to the plane of normal consciousness. Ramakrishna used to say the natural tendency of his mind is towards the Nirvikalpa plane and once in Samadhi, he would not be inclined to come back to the normal plane of consciousness, but would return for the sake of his devotees, and sometimes even this will was not enough, so he would fill his mind with trivial desires like; &quot;I will smoke tobacco&quot;, &quot;I will drink water&quot;, &quot;I will take this&quot;, &quot;I will see so and so, &quot;I will talk&quot;, and by repeatedly saying such things to his mind, he would make it gradually return to the plane of body consciousness. He would later often tell his devotees to &quot;tie the Knowledge of non-duality in the corner of your cloth and then do whatever you want&quot;.

===Islam and Christianity===
====Islam====
In 1866, Govinda Roy, a Hindu man who was previously initiated into Islam and practised Sufism, initiated Ramakrishna into Islam. Ramakrishna learned about Govinda through the latter&#x27;s regular visits to Dakshineswar. Being much impressed by seeing the faith and love for God in Govinda, Ramakrishna decided to practice Islam, reasoning: &quot;This also is a path to realisation of God; the sportive mother, the source of infinite Lila, has been blessing many people with the attainment of her lotus feet through this path also. I must see how through it she makes those who take refuge in her, attain their desired end.&quot;

Ramakrishna engaged himself in the practice of Islam according to its prescribed rules. He devotedly repeated the name of Allah, and said their prayers five times a day and remained in that state of mind for three days, after which he had full realisation through their path.

During this practice, Ramakrishna had a vision of a luminous figure, and Swami Nikhilananda&#x27;s biography speculates that the figure was &#x27;perhaps Mohammed&#x27;. According to these accounts, Ramakrishna &quot;devoutly repeated the name of Allah, wore a cloth like the Arab Muslims, said their prayer five times daily, and felt disinclined even to see images of the Hindu gods and goddesses, much less worship them—for the Hindu way of thinking had disappeared altogether from my mind.&quot; After three days of practice he had a vision of a &quot;radiant personage with grave countenance and white beard resembling the Prophet and merging with his body&quot;. He opined this vision to be of the all pervasive Brahman with attributes, as the vision eventually ended with him merging into the attributeless absolute Brahman. Kripal writes that this &quot;would have been a heretical experience through and through&quot; for most Muslims.

After his experience of practicing Islam, Ramakrishna opined that knowledge of Vedanta can make Hindus and Muslims sympathetic to one another as, &quot;There is, as it were, a mountain of difference between them. Their thoughts and faiths, actions and behaviour have remained quite unintelligible to one another in spite of their living together for so long a time.&quot;

====Christianity====
At the end of 1873, Ramakrishna started the practice of Christianity. After one of his devotees named Sambhu Chandra Mallick read the Bible to him, he got well acquainted with the life and teachings of Jesus.

Once when the Bible was being read out loud to him, from the very beginning there were references to the doctrine of Sin. After hearing a little and finding that it talked of nothing but sin, he refused to listen to it anymore further, saying, &quot;Just as in the case of snakebite, if the patient can be made to believe that there is no poison at all, he will be all right. Similarly, if one constantly thinks, I have taken the name of the Lord, so I am sinless, one becomes pure.&quot; He ideated that the more we give up such ideas as &quot;I am sinful&quot;, &quot;I am weak&quot;, the better it will be for all, as we all are children of God, thus not weak and sinful. He considered thinking of oneself as weak and sinful to be the greatest sin.

In 1874, Ramakrishna experienced a strange vision at the parlour of Jadu Mallik&#x27;s garden house, situated to the south of Kali temple in Dakshineswar. He was sitting there and looking keenly at a picture of Madonna and Child hanging on the wall, when all of a sudden he saw it come to life with effulgent rays of light emerging from the image and merging into his heart. A few days later, while walking in the Panchavati, he reportedly had a vision of Jesus coming towards him, embracing and merging into his body. At this moment he reportedly lost his normal consciousness, entered into trance and remained for some time identified with the all pervasive Brahman with attributes.

In his own room amongst other divine pictures was one of Christ, and he burnt incense before it morning and evening. There was also a picture showing Jesus Christ saving St Peter from drowning in the water.

==Popularization and final years==

=== Keshab Chandra Sen and the &quot;New Dispensation&quot; ===

In 1875, Ramakrishna met the influential Brahmo Samaj leader Keshab Chandra Sen.
 Keshab had accepted Christianity, and had separated from the Adi Brahmo Samaj. Formerly, Keshab had rejected idolatry, but under the influence of Ramakrishna he accepted Hindu polytheism and established the &quot;New Dispensation&quot; (&quot;Nava Vidhan&quot;) religious movement, based on Ramakrishna&#x27;s principles—&quot;Worship of God as Mother&quot;, &quot;All religions as true&quot; and &quot;Assimilation of Hindu polytheism into Brahmoism&quot;. Keshab also publicised Ramakrishna&#x27;s teachings in the journals of &quot;New Dispensation&quot; over a period of several years, which was instrumental in bringing Ramakrishna to the attention of a wider audience, especially the Bhadralok (English-educated classes of Bengal) and the Europeans residing in India.

Following Keshab, other Brahmos such as Vijaykrishna Goswami started to admire Ramakrishna, propagate his ideals and reorient their socio-religious outlook. Many prominent people of Kolkata—Pratap Chandra Mazumdar, Sivanath Shastri and Trailokyanath Sanyal—began visiting him during this time (1871–1885). Mazumdar wrote the first English biography of Ramakrishna, entitled &quot;The Hindu Saint&quot; in the &quot;Theistic Quarterly Review&quot; (1879), which played a vital role in introducing Ramakrishna to Westerners like the German indologist Max Müller. Newspapers reported that Ramakrishna was spreading &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Devotion&quot; among the educated classes of Kolkata and that he had succeeded in reforming the character of some youths whose morals had been corrupt.

Ramakrishna also had interactions with Debendranath Tagore, the father of Rabindranath Tagore, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, a renowned social worker. He had also met Swami Dayananda. Ramakrishna is considered one of the main contributors to the Bengali Renaissance.

=== Swami Vivekananda ===

Among the Europeans who were influenced by Ramakrishna was Principal Dr. William Hastie of the Scottish Church College, Kolkata. In the course of explaining the word &quot;trance&quot; in the poem &quot;The Excursion&quot; by William Wordsworth, Hastie told his students that if they wanted to know its &quot;real meaning&quot;, they should go to &quot;Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar.&quot; This prompted some of his students, including Narendranath Dutta (later Swami Vivekananda), to visit Ramakrishna.

Despite initial reservations, Vivekananda became Ramakrishna&#x27;s most influential follower, popularizing a modern interpretation of Indian traditions which harmonised Tantra, Yoga and Advaita Vedanta. Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna order, which eventually spread its mission posts throughout the world. Monastic disciples, who renounced their family and became the earliest monks of the Ramakrishna order, included Rakhal Chandra Ghosh (Swami Brahmananda), Kaliprasad Chandra (Swami Abhedananda), Taraknath Ghoshal (Swami Shivananda), Sashibhushan Chakravarty (Swami Ramakrishnananda), Saratchandra Chakravarty (Swami Saradananda), Tulasi Charan Dutta (Swami Nirmalananda), Gangadhar Ghatak (Swami Akhandananda), Hari Prasana (Swami Vijnanananda) Swami Turiyananda and others.

=== Other devotees and disciples ===

As his name spread, an ever-shifting crowd of all classes and castes visited Ramakrishna. Most of Ramakrishna&#x27;s prominent disciples came between 1879 and 1885. Apart from the early members who joined the Ramakrishna Order, his chief disciples consisted of:
* &quot;Grihasthas&quot; or &quot;The householders&quot;—Mahendranath Gupta, Girish Chandra Ghosh, Mahendra Lal Sarkar, Akshay Kumar Sen and others.
* A small group of women disciples, including &quot;Gauri Ma&quot; and &quot;Yogin Ma&quot;. A few of them were initiated into &quot;sanyasa&quot; through &quot;mantra deeksha&quot;. Among the women, Ramakrishna emphasised service to other women rather than &quot;tapasya&quot; (practice of austerities). Gauri Ma founded the Saradesvari Ashrama at Barrackpur, which was dedicated to the education and upliftment of women.

In preparation for monastic life, Ramakrishna ordered his monastic disciples to beg their food from door to door without distinction of caste. He gave them the saffron robe, the sign of the Sanyasi, and initiated them with &quot;Mantra Deeksha&quot;.

===Last days===
In the beginning of 1885 Ramakrishna suffered from clergyman&#x27;s throat, which gradually developed into throat cancer. He was moved to Shyampukur near Kolkata, where some of the best physicians of the time, including Dr. Mahendralal Sarkar, were engaged. When his condition aggravated, he was relocated to a large garden house at Cossipore on 11 December 1885.

During his last days, he was looked after by his monastic disciples and Sarada Devi. Ramakrishna was advised by the doctors to keep the strictest silence, but ignoring their advice, he incessantly conversed with visitors. According to traditional accounts, before his death, Ramakrishna transferred his spiritual powers to Vivekananda, and assured him of his avataric status. Requesting other monastic disciples to look upon Vivekananda as their leader, Ramakrishna asked Vivekananda to look after the welfare of the disciples, saying, &quot;keep my boys together&quot;, and asked him to &quot;teach them&quot;.

Ramakrishna&#x27;s condition gradually worsened, and he died in the early morning hours of 16 August 1886 at the Cossipore garden house. According to his disciples, this was &quot;mahasamadhi&quot;. His last word, on one account was &quot;ma&quot;, while another states he uttered thrice, the word &quot;Kali&quot;, before passing away.

After the death of their master, the monastic disciples led by Vivekananda formed a fellowship at a half-ruined house at Baranagar near the river Ganges, with the financial assistance of the householder disciples. This became the first Math or monastery of the disciples who constituted the first Ramakrishna Order.

==Reception and teachings==
Max Müller portrayed Ramakrishna as, &quot;...a Bhakta, a worshipper or lover of the deity, much more than a Gñânin or a knower.&quot; Postcolonial literary theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak wrote that Ramakrishna was a &quot;Bengali &quot;bhakta&quot; visionary&quot; and that as a &quot;bhakta&quot;, &quot;he turned chiefly towards Kali.&quot;

Indologist Heinrich Zimmer was the first Western scholar to interpret Ramakrishna&#x27;s worship of the Divine Mother as containing specifically Tantric elements. Neeval also argued that tantra played a main role in Ramakrishna&#x27;s spiritual development.

===Transformation into neo-Vedantin===
Vivekananda portrayed Ramakrishna as an Advaita Vedantin. Vivekananda&#x27;s approach can be located in the historical background of Ramakrishna and Calcutta during the mid-19th century. Neevel notes that the image of Ramakrishna underwent several transformations in the writings of his prominent admirers, who changed the &#x27;religious madman&#x27; into a calm and well-behaving proponent of Advaita Vedanta. Narasingha Sil has argued that Vivekananda revised and mythologised Ramakrishna&#x27;s image after Ramakrishna&#x27;s death. McDaniel notes that the Ramakrishna Mission is biased towards Advaita Vedanta, and downplays the importance of Shaktism in Ramakrishna&#x27;s spirituality. Malcolm McLean argued that the Ramakrishna Movement presents &quot;a particular kind of explanation of Ramakrishna, that he was some kind of neo-Vedantist who taught that all religions lead to the same Godhead.&quot;

Another set of commentators suggest that his philosophy is best understood as a nonsectarian Vedanta, which reconciles various philosophical perspectives. Commentators such as Satis Chandra Chatterjee and Jeffery Long have described Ramakrishna&#x27;s philosophy as a harmonizing form of Vedanta, using terms like &quot;Samanvayi Vedanta&quot; or &quot;Integral Vedanta&quot;. Ayon Maharaj, also known as Swami Medhananda, supports these scholars&#x27; view, proposing that Ramakrishna&#x27;s teachings are best understood through a nonsectarian Vedantic framework, specifically characterizing his philosophy as &quot;Vijnana Vedanta&quot;.

Carl Olson argued that in his presentation of his master, Vivekananda had hid much of Ramakrishna&#x27;s embarrassing sexual oddities from the public, because he feared that Ramakrishna would be misunderstood. Tyagananda and Vrajaprana argue that Oslon makes his &quot;astonishing claim&quot; based on Kripal&#x27;s speculations in &quot;Kali&#x27;s Child&quot;, which they argue are unsupported by any of the source texts.

Sumit Sarkar argued that he found in the &quot;Kathamrita&quot; traces of a binary opposition between unlearned oral wisdom and learned literate knowledge. He argues that all of our information about Ramakrishna, a rustic near-illiterate Brahmin, comes from urban &quot;bhadralok&quot; devotees, &quot;...whose texts simultaneously illuminate and transform.&quot;

Amiya Prosad Sen criticises Neevel&#x27;s analysis, and writes that &quot;it is really difficult to separate the Tantrik Ramakrishna from the Vedantic&quot;, since Vedanta and Tantra &quot;may appear to be different in some respects&quot;, but they also &quot;share some important postulates between them&quot;.

===Analysis of samadhi===
From his 10th or 11th year of school, trances became a common part of his life, and by his final years Ramakrishna&#x27;s samadhi periods occurred almost daily. Early on, these experiences have been interpreted as epileptic seizures, an interpretation which was rejected by Ramakrishna himself.

===Psychoanalysis===
In 1927 Romain Rolland discussed with Sigmund Freud the &quot;oceanic feeling&quot; described by Ramakrishna. Sudhir Kakar (1991), Jeffrey Kripal (1995), and Narasingha Sil (1998), analysed Ramakrishna&#x27;s mysticism and religious practices using psychoanalysis, arguing that his mystical visions, refusal to comply with ritual copulation in Tantra, &quot;Madhura Bhava&quot;, and criticism of &quot;Kamini-Kanchana&quot; (women and gold) reflect homosexuality.

====Romain Rolland and the &quot;Oceanic feeling&quot;====
The dialogue on psychoanalysis and Ramakrishna began in 1927 when Sigmund Freud&#x27;s friend Romain Rolland wrote to him that he should consider spiritual experiences, or &quot;the oceanic feeling&quot;, in his psychological works. Rolland described the trances and mystical states experienced by Ramakrishna and other mystics as an &quot;&#x27;oceanic&#x27; sentiment&quot;, one which Rolland had also experienced. Rolland believed that the universal human religious emotion resembled this &quot;oceanic sense&quot;. In his 1929 book &quot;La vie de Ramakrishna&quot;, Rolland distinguished between the feelings of unity and eternity which Ramakrishna experienced in his mystical states and Ramakrishna&#x27;s interpretation of those feelings as the goddess Kali.

====&quot;The Analyst and the Mystic&quot;====
In his 1991 book &quot;The Analyst and the Mystic&quot;, Indian psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar saw in Ramakrishna&#x27;s visions a spontaneous capacity for creative experiencing. Kakar also argued that culturally relative concepts of eroticism and gender have contributed to the Western difficulty in comprehending Ramakrishna. Kakar saw Ramakrishna&#x27;s seemingly bizarre acts as part of a &quot;bhakti&quot; path to God.

====&quot;Kali&#x27;s Child&quot;====
In 1995, Jeffrey J. Kripal in his controversial &quot;Kali&#x27;s Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna&quot;, an interdisciplinary study of Ramakrishna&#x27;s life &quot;using a range of theoretical models&quot;, most notably psychoanalysis, argued that Ramakrishna&#x27;s mystical experiences could be seen as symptoms of repressed homoeroticism, &quot;legitimat[ing] Ramakrishna&#x27;s religious visions by situating psychoanalytic discourse in a wider Tantric worldview&quot;. Jeffrey J. Kripal argued that Ramakrishna rejected Advaita Vedanta in favour of Shakti Tantra.

Kripal also argued in &quot;Kali&#x27;s Child&quot; that the Ramakrishna Movement had manipulated Ramakrishna&#x27;s biographical documents and that they published them in incomplete and bowdlerised editions (claiming, among other things, hiding Ramakrishna&#x27;s homoerotic tendencies), and that the Movement had suppressed Ram Chandra Datta&#x27;s &quot;Srisriramakrsna Paramahamsadever Jivanavrttanta&quot;.

These views were disputed by several authors, scholars, and psychoanalysts, including Alan Roland, Kelly Aan Raab, Somnath Bhattacharyya, J.S. Hawley, and Swami Atmajnanananda, who wrote that &quot;Jivanavrttanta&quot; had been reprinted nine times in Bengali as of 1995.

Jeffrey Kripal translates the phrase &quot;kamini-kanchana&quot; as &quot;lover and gold&quot;. The literal translation is &quot;women and gold&quot;. In Ramakrishna&#x27;s view, lust and greed are obstacles to God-realization. Kripal associates his translation of the phrase with Ramakrishna&#x27;s alleged disgust for women as lovers. Swami Tyagananda considered this to be a &quot;linguistic misconstruction.&quot; Ramakrishna also cautioned his women disciples against &quot;purusa-kanchana&quot; (&quot;man and gold&quot;) and Tyagananda writes that Ramakrishna used &quot;Kamini-Kanchana&quot; as &quot;cautionary words&quot; instructing his disciples to conquer the &quot;lust &quot;inside&quot; the mind&quot;.

The application of psychoanalysis has further been disputed by Tyagananda and Vrajaprana as being unreliable in understanding Tantra and interpreting cross-cultural contexts in &quot;Interpreting Ramakrishna: Kali&#x27;s Child Revisited&quot; (2010).

===Teachings===
The principal source for Ramakrishna&#x27;s teaching is Mahendranath Gupta&#x27;s &quot;Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita&quot;, which is regarded as a Bengali classic and &quot;the central text of the tradition&quot;. Gupta used the pen name &quot;M&quot;, as the author of the Gospel. The text was published in five volumes from 1902 to 1932. Based on Gupta&#x27;s diary notes, each of the five volumes purports to document Ramakrishna&#x27;s life from 1882 to 1886.

The most popular English translation of the &quot;Kathamrita&quot; is &quot;The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna&quot; by Swami Nikhilananda. Nikhilananda&#x27;s translation rearranged the scenes in the five volumes of the &quot;Kathamrita&quot; into a linear sequence. Swami Nikhilananda worked with Margaret Woodrow Wilson, daughter of President Woodrow Wilson, who helped the swami to refine his literary style into &quot;flowing American English&quot;. The mystic hymns were rendered into free verse by the American poet John Moffitt. Wilson and American mythology scholar Joseph Campbell helped edit the manuscript. Aldous Huxley wrote in his Forward to the Gospel, &quot;...&#x27;M&#x27; produced a book unique, so far as my knowledge goes, in the literature of hagiography. Never have the casual and unstudied utterances of a great religious teacher been set down with so minute detail.&quot; Philosopher Lex Hixon writes that &quot;The Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; is &quot;spiritually authentic&quot; and a &quot;powerful rendering of the &quot;Kathamrita&quot;&quot;. Malcolm Mclean and Jeffrey Kripal both argue that the translation is unreliable, though Kripal&#x27;s interpretation is criticized by Hugh Urban.

Ramakrishna&#x27;s teachings were imparted in rustic Bengali, using stories and parables. These teachings made a powerful impact on Kolkata&#x27;s intellectuals, despite the fact that his ideas were far removed from issues of modernism or national independence. According to contemporary reports, Ramakrishna&#x27;s linguistic style was unique, even to those who spoke Bengali. It contained obscure local words and idioms from village Bengali, interspersed with philosophical Sanskrit terms and references to the Vedas, Puranas, and Tantras. For that reason, according to philosopher Lex Hixon, his speeches cannot be literally translated into English or any other language. Scholar Amiya P. Sen argued that certain terms that Ramakrishna may have used only in a metaphysical sense are being improperly invested with new, contemporaneous meanings.

Ramakrishna&#x27;s primary biographers describe him as talkative and would reminisce for hours about his own eventful spiritual life, tell tales, explain Vedantic doctrines with humorous, and at times colorful illustrations, raising questions and answering them himself, crack jokes, sing songs, and mimic the ways of all types of worldly people, keeping the visitors enthralled. As an example of Ramakrishna&#x27;s teachings and fun with his followers, here&#x27;s a quote about his visit to an exhibition, “I once visited the MUSEUM There was a display of fossils: living animals had turned into stone. Just look at the power of association! Imagine what would happen if you constantly kept the company of the holy.” Mani Mallick replied (laughing): “If you would go there again we could have ten to fifteen more years of spiritual instructions.”

And here&#x27;s an example of his using off-color language to make a point. On Tuesday December 18, 1883, Ramakrishna and a few of his close followers made a visit to the Kolkata home of a very wealthy devotee. From the temple the Master went to Jadu Mallick&#x27;s house. Jadu was surrounded by admirers, well-dressed dandies. He welcomed the master. 

Master (with a smile): &quot;Why do you keep so many clowns and flatters with you?&quot;

Jadu (smiling): &quot;That you may liberate them.&quot; (Laughter.)

Master: &quot;Flatters think that the rich man will loosen his purse-strings for them. But it is very difficult to get anything from him. Once a jackal saw a bullock and would not give up his company. The bullock roamed about and the jackal followed him. The jackal thought, &#x27;There hang the bullock&#x27;s testicles. Some time or other they will drop to the ground and I shall eat them.&#x27; When the bullock slept on the ground, the jackal lay down too, and when the bullock moved about, the jackal followed him. Many days passed in this way, but the bullock&#x27;s testicles still clung to his body. The jackal went away disappointed. (All laugh.) That also happens to flatterers.&quot; 
Ramakrishna was skilled with words and had an extraordinary style of preaching and instructing, which may have helped convey his ideas to even the most skeptical temple visitors. His speeches reportedly revealed a sense of joy and fun, but he was not at a loss when debating with intellectual philosophers. Philosopher Arindam Chakrabarti contrasted Ramakrishna&#x27;s talkativeness with the Buddha&#x27;s legendary reticence, and compared his teaching style to that of Socrates.

Ramakrishna&#x27;s religious practice and worldview, contained elements of Bhakti, Tantra and Vedanta. Ramakrishna emphasised God-realisation, stating that &quot;To realize God is the one goal in life.&quot; Ramakrishna found that Hinduism, Christianity and Islam all move towards the same God or divine, though using different ways: &quot;So many religions, so many paths to reach one and the same goal,&quot; namely to experience God or Divine. Ramakrishna further said, &quot;All scriptures - the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras - seek Him alone and no one else.&quot; The Vedic phrase &quot;Truth is one; only It is called by different names,&quot; became a stock phrase to express Ramakrishna&#x27;s inclusivism.

Ramakrishna preferred &quot;the duality of adoring a Divinity beyond himself to the self-annihilating immersion of nirvikalpa samadhi, and he helped &quot;bring to the realm of Eastern energetics and realization the daemonic celebration that the human is always between a reality it has not yet attained and a reality to which it is no longer limited.&quot;
Ramakrishna is quoted in the Nikhilananda Gospel, &quot;The devotee of God wants to eat sugar, and not to become sugar.&quot;

Ramakrishna taught that &quot;yatra jiv tatra Shiv&quot; (wherever there is a living being, there is Shiva). His teaching, &quot;Jive daya noy, Shiv gyane jiv seba&quot; (not kindness to living beings, but serving the living being as Shiva Himself) is considered the inspiration for the philanthropic work carried out by his chief disciple Vivekananda.

In the Kolkata scene of the mid to late nineteenth century, Ramakrishna was opinionated on the subject of Chakri. Chakri can be described as a type of low-paying servitude done by educated men—typically government or commerce-related clerical positions. On a basic level, Ramakrishna saw this system as a corrupt form of European social organisation that forced educated men to be servants not only to their bosses at the office, but also to their wives at home. What Ramakrishna saw as the primary detriment of Chakri, however, was that it forced workers into a rigid, impersonal clock-based time structure. He saw the imposition of strict adherence to each second on the watch as a roadblock to spirituality. Despite this, however, Ramakrishna demonstrated that Bhakti could be practised as an inner retreat to experience solace in the face of Western-style discipline and often discrimination in the workplace.

His spiritual movement indirectly aided nationalism, as it rejected caste distinctions and religious prejudices.

==Influence and legacy==


Ramakrishna is considered an important figure in the Bengali Renaissance of 19th–20th century. Several organisations have been established in his name. The Ramakrishna Math and Mission is the main organisation founded by Swami Vivekananda in 1897. The Mission conducts extensive work in health care, disaster relief, rural management, tribal welfare, elementary and higher education. The movement is considered one of the revitalisation movements of India. Amiya Sen writes that Vivekananda&#x27;s &quot;social service gospel&quot; stemmed from direct inspiration from Ramakrishna and rests substantially on the &quot;liminal quality&quot; of the Master&#x27;s message.

Other organisations include the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society founded by Swami Abhedananda in 1923, the Ramakrishna Sarada Math founded by a rebel group in 1929, the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission formed by Swami Nityananda in 1976, and the Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission founded in 1959 as a sister organisation by the Ramakrishna Math and Mission.

Rabindranath Tagore wrote a poem on Ramakrishna, &quot;To the Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Deva&quot;:
During the 1937 Parliament of Religions, which was held at the Ramakrishna Mission in Calcutta, Tagore acknowledged Ramakrishna as a great saint because
Max Müller, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sri Aurobindo, and Leo Tolstoy have acknowledged Ramakrishna&#x27;s contribution to humanity.

Ramakrishna&#x27;s influence is also seen in the works of artists such as Franz Dvorak (1862–1927) and Philip Glass.

<doc id="422514" wikidata="Q2014874" url="?curid=422514" title="Mega Man 3">
<text>Mega Man 3 (stylized as Mega Man III) is a 1990 action-platform game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game of the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series and was originally released in Japan on September 28, 1990. The game was released in North America later in 1990 and in European regions by Nintendo in 1992. Taking place after the events of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, the plot follows the titular hero as he helps his creator, Dr. Light, and a supposedly former enemy, Dr. Wily, collect parts for a peace-keeping robot by defeating several Robot Masters that have gone haywire.

An action-platform game, &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; follows the same format set forth by its two predecessors. The player, as Mega Man, must complete a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stage&#x27;s boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will throughout the rest of the game. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man&#x27;s canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.

Following the success of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; released two years earlier, &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; has sold 1.17 million copies and has been positively received in critical reviews. Its presentation and gameplay have been especially praised, although many sources found the game to be too difficult. Like other titles in the series, &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; has been re-released several times on other gaming platforms, on mobile phones, and as part of various &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise compilations. A sequel, &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;, was released in 1991.

==Plot==
&quot;Mega Man 3&quot; takes place during an unspecified year during the 21st century (20XX). 2-3 months after Mega Man 2, the mad scientist Dr. Wily, having twice had plans for world domination dashed, claims to have reformed and begins work with Dr. Light on a project to build a peace-keeping robot named &quot;Gamma&quot;. Robot Masters – Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Magnet Man, Hard Man, Snake Man, Gemini Man, and Needle Man – in charge of a set of &quot;mining worlds&quot;, however, go berserk and make off with Gamma&#x27;s eight power crystals. Mega Man is called into action, this time with a canine companion named Rush, to retrieve the crystals from the sites. Throughout his mission, the protagonist continuously encounters and spars with Break Man, a masked foe who has abilities comparable to Mega Man&#x27;s own. After Mega Man destroys the eight Robot Masters, he then revisits four of the mining sites to face off against eight &quot;Doc Robots&quot;, who possess the abilities of the Robot Masters from Mega Man&#x27;s previous mission. Once the crystals are retrieved, Wily reverts to his evil ways, steals Gamma, and retreats to his new fortress. To stop Wily&#x27;s newest plan to conquer the world, Mega Man destroys Gamma and defeats Wily in a final confrontation. As the fortress begins to crumble, Break Man appears in enough time to save Mega Man but is too late to save Wily, who is seen being crushed under the rubble. When Mega Man regains consciousness in Dr. Light&#x27;s lab, his creator informs him that Break Man is actually his older brother Proto Man.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mega Man 3&quot; retains the platforming and action game elements established by the two &quot;Mega Man&quot; games released before it. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man as he traverses eight selectable stages. The player&#x27;s primary blaster weapon is used to fend off the game&#x27;s numerous enemies. Several power-ups can be picked up in each stage, including life energy, special weapon ammunition, extra lives, and &quot;E-Tanks&quot;, which are stored and can be selected to refill the player&#x27;s life energy completely. At the end of every stage the player must defeat a Robot Master boss: Magnet Man, Hard Man, Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Snake Man, Gemini Man, or Needle Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and stage related to the weapon&#x27;s power. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon is added to Mega Man&#x27;s arsenal. The Robot Masters are weak to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters, allowing the player to ease the boss battles by clearing some stages before others.

&quot;Mega Man 3&quot; is the first &quot;Mega Man&quot; game to feature the slide maneuver, which lets the player slip under enemy attacks and low-level barriers. After completing certain stages, Mega Man can access new abilities in his robot dog companion Rush. Rush&#x27;s transformations include the &quot;Rush Coil&quot; for jumping higher, the &quot;Rush Jet&quot; for flying around the screen, and the &quot;Rush Marine&quot; for traveling underwater. Throughout the various stages the player encounters Proto Man (as Break Man), a mini-boss who, once defeated, will open passageways for the player to advance. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; also expands upon the two preceding games by having additional stages set between the initial eight Robot Masters and the linear stages of Dr. Wily&#x27;s fortress. A password system can be used to return to the game with most of the stages completed. The &quot;Doc Robots&quot; are fought after defeating all 8 Robot Masters. The Doc Robots are faced in the Spark Man stage, Needle Man stage, Gemini Man stage, and Shadow Man stage.
==Development==
Development on &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; began at Capcom over a year after the release of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;. Akira Kitamura, the lead supervisor for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time. Artist Keiji Inafune, credited as &quot;Inafking&quot;, considered &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to &quot;[...] what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game.&quot; He had &quot;preset notions&quot; about successful development because of the team&#x27;s good experience with &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; and found that his new superior &quot;didn&#x27;t really understand &quot;Mega Man&quot; the way his predecessor did&quot;. During the game&#x27;s production, the developers lost the main planner, so Inafune had to take over that job for its completion. Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines. The team was forced to put &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; on the market before they thought it was ready, releasing it in September instead of the series&#x27; usual arrivals in December. Inafune concluded, &quot;I knew that if we had more time to polish it, we could do a lot of things better, make it a better game, but the company said that we needed to release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different.&quot;

&quot;Mega Man 3&quot; brought new characters and gameplay mechanics to the franchise. Though Inafune considers the gameplay to have lost some of its simplicity, he felt Mega Man&#x27;s slide ability was successfully implemented to enhance the player&#x27;s control while battling enemies. Mega Man&#x27;s sidekick dog Rush was designed by combining the functionality of three support tools from &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, which would ease the player&#x27;s navigation of stages. In addition to the Marine and Coil modes, Rush was originally intended to have a &quot;drill&quot; mode that would allow Mega Man to tunnel underground. Another new character, Proto Man, was introduced in a way that the player would be unable to tell if he was an ally or an enemy to Mega Man. His design was influenced by anime, and he was given both a scarf and shield to make him appear &quot;tougher&quot; than Mega Man. The design team wanted Proto Man to sport uncovered hair, but they instead opted for an open-faced helmet illustration for both the television commercials and instruction manual. Proto Man&#x27;s original Japanese name, Blues, was changed by Capcom&#x27;s North American division despite Inafune&#x27;s protests. Capcom did this not only to be consistent with Rockman&#x27;s English name, but because they thought that the name Blues made no sense. Inafune attempted to defend it due to the name&#x27;s musical connotation to character names in the series. Though Rush and Proto Man were created solely by the developer, Capcom sought ideas from fans for the creation of the game&#x27;s Robot Masters as they had done with &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;. The team received around 50,000 design submissions for &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, only eight of which were used in the game. Harumi Fujita, credited as &quot;Mrs. Tarumi&quot;, was the initial composer of the game, but she only completed a few songs before giving birth and having to drop off the project. She composed the songs ‘Needle Man’, ‘Gemini Man’ and ‘Staff Roll’. Capcom composer Yasuaki Fujita, also known as &quot;Bun Bun&quot; was then assigned to complete the soundtrack and created the majority of the score.

==Reception==

&quot;Mega Man 3&quot; has enjoyed a positive reception from print and online sources. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN, Christian Nutt and Justin Speer of GameSpot, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (&quot;The Lessers&quot;) of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, Edward J. Semrad of &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;), and the staff of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; all mutually found the game to have impressive graphics, enjoyable music, and challenging gameplay. Nutt and Speer summarized &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; as a &quot;top-notch game&quot; and Capcom&#x27;s &quot;pinnacle of NES effort&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Colin Moriarty argued the game as a major improvement over the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; and that it even surpasses the critically acclaimed &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; in quality. Moriarty justified this claim with the third installment&#x27;s attempt at better storytelling, its longer length than any other classic &quot;Mega Man&quot; game, and its inclusion of all eight &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; Robot Masters in addition to its own. Brett Alan Weiss (AllGame) described it as doing what &quot;a great sequel is supposed to do by recapturing the fun, spirit and excitement of its predecessors while adding new levels, characters and challenges.&quot;

Some critics found &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; to be excessively difficult. &quot;GamePro&quot; contributor McKinley Noble comically stated that actions such as &quot;pulling teeth, lifting a car over your head or performing open-heart surgery&quot; are all significantly easier than beating &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;. Whitehead noted, &quot;Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there&#x27;s a constant state of delicious near-panic as you wait to see what vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills.&quot; The Lessers additionally saw considerable flicker when too many sprites appear onscreen at once. The writers mentioned that it detracted from the normally crisp graphics the few times it was noticed.

Since its 1990 release, &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; has sold over one million copies worldwide, making it the 48th best-selling Capcom game. &quot;EGM&quot; listed &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; as &quot;The Best Sequel to an Existing Game&quot; in its 1991 Video Game Buyer&#x27;s Guide. The readers of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; voted it the third-best game of 1990 in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Nintendo Power Awards&quot; for that year. The publication listed &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; as the 11th best NES video game in their 20th anniversary issue in 2008. IGN included it at number 16 on its &quot;Top 100 NES Games of All Time&quot;. Finally, &quot;GamePro&quot; ranked &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; as the third-greatest 8-bit video game of all time.

==Legacy==
&quot;Mega Man 3&quot; has seen releases on many consoles and other devices since its 1990 debut on the NES. In the United States, it was made into a stripped-down, handheld LCD game by Tiger Electronics. It is the only &quot;Mega Man&quot; game in Nintendo&#x27;s PlayChoice-10 arcade library. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; was remade in 1994 for the Sega Genesis game &quot;Mega Man: The Wily Wars&quot;, featuring updated graphics and sound. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; was released on the Sony PlayStation in the &quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot; line in Japan in 1999. This version has arranged music, artwork galleries, and a &quot;navi&quot; mode for beginner players. The NES edition of the game was also part of a North American compilation of ten titles in the series called &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot;, which was released for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube in 2004, and the Xbox in 2005. Also in 2005, &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; was bundled alongside other Capcom games as part of a Plug It In &amp; Play TV Games peripheral by Jakks Pacific. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; was released by Capcom on mobile phones in Japan in 2005 and in North America in 2008. The NES version made its way to the Nintendo Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service worldwide in 2008. The &quot;Complete Works&quot; version was released on the PlayStation Network (downloadable on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable) in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; was made available for download on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in Japan on September 26, 2012. &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; and its prequel &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; are included on the Super Retro-Cade collection, a dedicated console released in 2018 that comes with 90 arcade, NES and Super NES video games.

Many of the features introduced in &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; have been carried on by the series. These include the characters Proto Man and Rush, the player&#x27;s ability to slide, and extra stages set between the initial eight Robot Masters and Dr. Wily&#x27;s fortress. With the release of &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; in 2008, however, some of these elements and others implemented in the third through eighth installments were forgone in favor of the more basic aspects of &quot;Mega Man&quot; and &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;. The producers of &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; have referred to the ninth game as &quot;the new &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;&quot; because they wanted to surpass what they accomplished in &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;.

The game was adapted into the Archie Comics Mega Man series over an extended period, with Gamma being introduced and having its power source stolen in the &quot;Redemption&quot; arc while the full adaptation takes place in &quot;Legends of the Blue Bomber&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Betrayal&quot;. One of the biggest differences was that &quot;Super Adventure Rockman&quot; was adapted into the continuity prior to this game; as such, the &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; Robot Masters debut in that adaptation. This also results in Shadow Man&#x27;s ruins of origin being made the Lanfront Ruins of &quot;Super Adventure Rockman&quot; and connecting his history to that of Ra Moon; a flashback featured in the &quot;Legends of the Blue Bomber&quot; arc reveals that his history is also connected with the mysterious robot who fights Duo in the beginning of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;.

<text>Mega Man 4 (stylized as Mega Man IV) is a 1991 action-platform game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the fourth game in the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series and was originally released in Japan on December 6, 1991. The game was localized in North America the following January, and in Europe in 1993.

The game&#x27;s story takes place after the third defeat and supposed death of Dr. Wily in &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, and features the Earth coming under threat from a mysterious scientist named Dr. Cossack and his eight &quot;Robot Masters&quot;. Fearing the worst, Dr. Light sends Mega Man to save the world once again. &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; carries on the same action and platforming gameplay as the first three games, in which the player completes a series of stages in any order and adds the weapon of each stage&#x27;s boss to Mega Man&#x27;s arsenal. One notable added feature is the &quot;New Mega Buster&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Mega Buster&quot;), an upgraded arm cannon that lets the player charge a regular shot into a much more powerful blast. The development team was mindful that this innovation would change the overall feel of the game.

Similarly to its predecessors &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; was remade for PlayStation in Japan. In later years it appeared on mobile phones and as part of game compilations, including &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot;. The emulated versions were also released through PlayStation Network and Virtual Console. A sequel, &quot;Mega Man 5&quot;, was released in 1992.

==Plot==
&quot;Mega Man 4&quot; takes place in an unspecified year during the 21st century, described as the year &quot;20XX&quot;. One year after the events of &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, a mysterious Russian scientist named Dr. Cossack unleashes an army of robots with the intention of world domination, much like Dr. Wily before him. Dr. Light calls upon his own greatest creation, the hero Mega Man, to go after Cossack&#x27;s Robot Masters, who have seized control of eight cities. He also equips Mega Man with the New Mega Buster, which he developed in secret.

Upon defeating the eight Robot Masters — Toad Man, Bright Man, Pharaoh Man, Ring Man, Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man, and Drill Man — Mega Man makes his way to Cossack&#x27;s icy fortress. However, in the middle of his battle with Cossack, Mega Man&#x27;s brother Proto Man teleports in with Cossack&#x27;s daughter, Kalinka. The girl begs Mega Man to stop fighting her father and elaborating that Dr. Wily had kidnapped her and forced her father into building an army of robots. With Wily&#x27;s plan undone by Proto Man, he steps out of the shadows. Mega Man pursues his nemesis and fights through the scientist&#x27;s Wily Castle, but Wily manages to escape in the end. Mega Man escapes as the fortress begins to self-destruct, and rides home on the top of a passing train, where he is greeted by Roll and Rush.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mega Man 4&quot; features similar gameplay to the previous three games. The player must complete a series of eight stages in an order of the player&#x27;s choosing. The protagonist, Mega Man, is able to run, jump, shoot, and climb his way past obstacles and enemies; the game also retains the slide ability which debuted in &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;. At the end of each stage is a Robot Master boss. Upon defeating a Robot Master, Mega Man gains the Robot Master&#x27;s signature weapon, which can then be used by the player in subsequent stages. Once all eight Robot Masters are destroyed, two separate sets of linear stages must be completed to finish the game. One major addition to the gameplay in &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; is the &quot;Mega Buster&quot;, an upgraded version of Mega Man&#x27;s arm cannon. By holding down the firing button, the player can now charge a shot, resulting in a blast far more powerful than the standard shot. This feature was later used in subsequent incarnations of the franchise.

The hero&#x27;s dog Rush makes a return from &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; with the ability to transform into &quot;Coil&quot;, &quot;Jet&quot;, and &quot;Marine&quot; modes for navigating different environments. Aside from Rush, two additional support items called the &quot;Wire Adaptor&quot; and the &quot;Balloon Adaptor&quot; also aid the player in reaching areas not normally accessible. However, these hidden adaptors must be found in the stages rather than being awarded for defeating a Robot Master. Like the Master Weapons, the three Rush modes and the two adaptors are each limited to an amount of weapon power that drains when in use. The character &quot;Flip Top&quot; Eddie is introduced in &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;. Eddie, who went on to appear in later &quot;Mega Man&quot; games, provides the player with a random item (such as health, ammunition, or an E-Tank) at designated points in some of the levels.

==Development==
&quot;Mega Man&quot; series artist Keiji Inafune, credited as &quot;Inafking&quot;, stated that the development team had very few problems while working on &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;. Inafune designed Dr. Cossack and Kalinka as two new storyline characters for the game. Cossack, who was originally named &quot;Dr. Vice&quot;, was made much younger than Dr. Light and Dr. Wily. Inafune also considered giving him American traits, but decided upon influences from Russia instead. Kalinka was created because so many male characters already existed in the series at this point. However, Inafune did not intend for players to compare her to Mega Man&#x27;s sister Roll. The idea for Eddie originally came about during the development of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;. Eddie was designed as a supporting character that &quot;would behave like a lottery&quot;, either pleasantly surprising or disappointing the player with the item he gives Mega Man.

&quot;Mega Man 4&quot; was the first game in the series for Hayato Kaji, credited as &quot;K. Hayato&quot;, a prominent designer for many later &quot;Mega Man&quot; games. Kaji was responsible for the chargeable Mega Buster, a gameplay mechanic that would become a staple of the series. &quot;We knew adding a two-level or three-level charge would change the whole flavor of the game in some respects, and we were very mindful of that,&quot; Inafune explained. The Robot Masters in &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; are a result of a design contest for fans held in Japan. With over 70,000 character submissions, the development team spent an extended period of time narrowing them down to only eight bosses. According to Kaji, the team was very satisfied with many of the chosen designs and almost no changes were made to their original illustrations. They were so impressed with Skull Man that they scrapped an entire level being created just so they could restart it and devote it to that Robot Master. The winning eight contestants of the design contest were each issued a special &quot;golden cartridge&quot; edition of &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;. As there are only eight of these cartridges in existence, they are extremely rare and fetch a large collector&#x27;s price today. The musical score for &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; was composed by Minae Fujii, credited as &quot;Ojalin&quot;, while the sound programming and sound effects were handled by Yasuaki Fujita, credited as &quot;Bun Bun&quot;, who had composed the soundtrack for &quot;Mega Man 3&quot; the previous year.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Mega Man 4&quot; has received mostly positive critical reviews. Reviews contemporary with the game&#x27;s release by the United States magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and the United Kingdom publications &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; and &quot;Total!&quot; all found &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; to have high quality graphics, sound, and gameplay. However, they also noted very little improvement over previous entries in the series. &quot;GamePro&quot; was satisfied with the lack of changes. &quot;&quot;Mega Man 4&quot; continues the tradition — crazed robot baddies, good character graphics, great background art and warped, mechanical music,&quot; the reviewer said. &quot;When you have a good game, why make radical changes? Capcom sticks to the blueprints in &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; — guaranteeing happiness for &quot;Mega Man&quot; fans everywhere.&quot; &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; made it into IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 NES Games&quot; list at number 95, with staff writer Matt Casamassina praising its attempt at better narrative and an essentially similar experience to the first three &quot;Mega Man&quot; games. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that, as a stand-alone title, the game is one of the best experiences available from the NES library, although not when compared to its superior predecessors. He enjoyed the use of a second set of castle levels to significantly extend the length of the game, a tradition carried on by the next two titles in the series.

Numerous video game journalists and enthusiasts including Thomas, Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack, GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer, and 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish, refer to the fourth installment as a turning point for the quality of titles in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series. Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game, likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System at the time of its release. Parrish proclaimed, &quot;Here&#x27;s where the series starts to go off the rails a bit -- the Dr. Wily fake out was silly, the music was terrible, the bosses and weapons were uninspired, and the ability to charge up the Mega Buster is often cited as a game-breaking innovation.&quot; Thomas identified the chargeable Mega Buster as disrupting the balance of the game and rendering many of the Master Weapons useless, one of the concepts that set the &quot;Mega Man&quot; games apart from other action-platformers.

&quot;Mega Man 4&quot; was re-released for the PlayStation as part of the &quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot; series in 1999. This version of the game features a special &quot;navi mode&quot; that guides players through each level and has arranged music remixes. A port of the &quot;Complete Works&quot; edition was released on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube in 2004 and the Xbox in 2005, as part of the North American-exclusive &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot;. The NES version has also been re-released on Japanese i-mode mobile phones in 2005, worldwide on the Wii&#x27;s downloadable Virtual Console service in 2010, and on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2011.
A fanmade ROM hack of &quot;Mega Man 4&quot; known as &quot;Rockman 4 Minus Infinity&quot; (&quot;R4MI&quot;) was released in mid-2012. Created by developer PureSabe, the ROM hack has received positive reception for its extreme difficulty and creative transformation of the original game&#x27;s source material.

<text>Blood &amp; Honour is a neo-Nazi music promotion network and right-wing extremist political group founded in the United Kingdom by Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1987. It is composed of white nationalists and has links to Combat 18.

Sometimes the code &quot;28&quot; is used to represent Blood &amp; Honour, derived from the second and eighth letters of the Latin alphabet, B and H, and the group uses Nazi symbolism. Its official website self-describes as a &quot;musical based resistance network&quot; and dubs its &quot;global confederacy of freedom fighters&quot; Brotherhood 28.

In the UK, the group used to organise white power concerts by Rock Against Communism (RAC) bands. It publishes a magazine called &quot;Blood and Honour&quot;. There are official divisions in several countries, including two rival groups in the United States. It is banned in several countries, including Germany, Spain, Russia, and Canada. In January 2025, the UK government applied financial sanctions to the organisation under counter-terrorism regulations.

==History==
Blood &amp; Honour was established in 1987 by Skrewdriver frontman Ian Stuart Donaldson, supported by the bands No Remorse, Brutal Attack, Sudden Impact, and Squadron. These bands were previously affiliated with the White Noise Club, a subsidiary organisation of the National Front responsible for organising Rock Against Communism concerts, operating the White Noise Records label, and publishing a zine called &quot;White Noise&quot;.

Tensions between Donaldson and the leadership of the White Noise Club developed in 1987, as Donaldson felt that the White Noise Club was siphoning money out of the Rock Against Communism scene to use for the National Front&#x27;s political campaigns. Donaldson&#x27;s Skrewdriver officially split from the White Noise Club in May of 1987, and several other bands within the scene followed.

Blood &amp; Honour was launched as an alternative to the White Noise Club in July of 1987, with the appearance of the first edition of &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; magazine. Copies were sent free of charge to members of the White Noise Club (Donaldson used contacts within the National Front to obtain their mailing list), together with a note by Donaldson denouncing the White Noise Club as a &quot;corrupt rip-off&quot;. A concert to &quot;launch&quot; Blood &amp; Honour was held at the St Helier Arms on the 5th of September, 1987, featuring performances from Skrewdriver, No Remorse, Brutal Attack, and Sudden Impact.

By the end of 1988, &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; magazine was a quarterly that had grown from eight to 16 pages after a few issues. The magazine included concert reports, band interviews, readers&#x27; letters, RAC record charts and a column called &quot;White Whispers&quot;. A mail-order service called Skrewdriver Services soon formed within its pages, selling items such as white power albums, T-shirts and flags; Loyalist music tapes; and Swastika pendants.

The back page of &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; Issue Number 13 advertised a Skrewdriver concert in London on 12 September 1992. Posters and fliers were posted around the country, advertising the concert and listing a redirection point as Waterloo Rail Station. The night before the concert, Donaldson was attacked in a Burton pub. The next day, police closed down Waterloo Station and the tube station, preventing many people from reaching the redirection point. Hundreds more Blood &amp; Honour supporters who had journeyed from abroad were turned back at ports in Folkestone and Dover. The Blood &amp; Honour supporters clashed with anti-fascist protesters. Missiles such as bricks and champagne bottles taken from bins outside of South Bank restaurants were used during the ensuing riot. Battles ensued for about two hours until the police separated the two groups, and the concert proceeded in the function hall of the Yorkshire Grey pub in Eltham, South-East London. The incident got international media coverage and became known as the &quot;Battle of Waterloo&quot;.

In 1992, the newly formed Midlands division organised the annual Blood &amp; Honour &quot;White Xmas&quot; concert. On 19 December, over 400 supporters gathered at a working men&#x27;s club in Mansfield to watch No Remorse, Razors Edge and Skrewdriver perform. In 1993, the East Midlands division planned to stage an outdoor festival on 31 July. Donaldson was arrested and served with an injunction order not to perform at the concert. The venue was blockaded by the police, who seized amplifiers and confiscated sound equipment. It was the biggest police operation in the area since the Miners strikes in the early 1980s.

Later that year, the East Midlands division organised a concert for 25 September. Three nights before the concert, Donaldson and a few friends were travelling in a car that spun out of control into a ditch. Donaldson and another passenger died, and other passengers had minor wounds. The following day, 100 Skrewdriver supporters travelled to the Blood &amp; Honour social in the Midlands, unaware of the deaths.

Each year, on or near the anniversary of Donaldson&#x27;s death, a large memorial concert is held. In 2008, a concert in Redhill, Somerset attracted widespread BBC, radio and newspaper coverage. The memorial concert to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of Donaldson reportedly was the biggest associated gig in the UK with between 1,000 and 1,200 people attending. On the 23rd anniversary of the death of founder, Ian Stuart Donaldson, the annual memorial gig once again attracted international television and media coverage.

Blood &amp; Honour remains active in the UK but has contracted since the 1980s and 1990s; researchers Matthew Worley and Nigel Copsey suggest that its membership consists mainly of &quot;heavily-tattooed men in their fifties reliving their &#x27;glory days&#x27; at occasional gigs in back-room pubs&quot;. As of 2019, the organisation organises up to fifteen concerts a year in the UK.

In January 2025, the UK Government announced a full asset freeze against Blood &amp; Honour, &quot;an entity it has reasonable grounds to suspect of being involved in terrorist activities through promoting and encouraging terrorism, seeking to recruit people for that purpose and making funds available for the purposes of its terrorist activities&quot;.

==Description and symbolism==

The group is composed of White Nationalists and has links to Combat 18. Its official website self-describes as a &quot;musical based resistance network&quot; and dubs its &quot;global confederacy of freedom fighters&quot; Brotherhood 28.

Sometimes the code &quot;28&quot; is used to represent Blood &amp; Honour, derived from the second and eighth letters of the Latin alphabet, B and H. Though different national chapters of Blood &amp; Honour use different Nationalist symbols based on their location, common symbolic traits include the usage of a modernised Blackletter script, colours of the Nazi German flag, and other Nazi symbolism, including the Totenkopf Death&#x27;s Head insignia of the SS-Totenkopfverbände and concentration camp units.

==International groups==
There are official divisions in several countries. In the United States, two rival groups claim the name: Blood and Honour Council USA and Blood and Honour America Division.

Blood &amp; Honour is banned in several countries. Blood &amp; Honour Germany was outlawed in Germany in 2000, Spain in 2011, and Russia in 2012. In 2019, the government of Canada placed Blood &amp; Honour on its list of designated terrorist groups.

In 1999, some Blood &amp; Honour groups published support on their official websites for the Malexander murders in Sweden.

Blood &amp; Honour Australia &amp; the Southern Cross Hammerskins have been organising the annual Ian Donaldson Memorial concert in Melbourne since 1994. Reports by the media that the concert in 2019 was cancelled at the last minute were false, as it went ahead as it does each year without incident.

<text>D0280 &quot;Falcon&quot; was a single prototype diesel-electric locomotive, built for British Railways in 1961. It was one of a series of three prototypes: &quot;Falcon&quot;, DP2 and &quot;Lion&quot;, eventually leading to the Class 47 and Class 50. A requirement was expressed by the BTC at a meeting on 15 January 1960 for new Type 4 designs of Co-Co arrangement, which would be lighter than the earlier 1Co-Co1 locomotives such as the &quot;Peak&quot; classes, produced under the Pilot Scheme.

Brush had a licence to build the Maybach MD655 engine, as already used in the Western region diesel-hydraulics, although their licence limited them to diesel-electric locomotives. These engines were of lower weight than their competitors, which led Brush to consider using a pair of them, like the Western hydraulics. Design work began in 1959 under contract Nº 04/20600, before the BTC requirement had been issued.

British Rail later assigned Class 53 and the running number 1200. While not in any sense a failure, the design was the victim of advances in locomotive technology (specifically, the power obtainable from single medium-speed diesel engines) and was never duplicated.

== History ==

The &quot;Falcon&quot; project began in 1959 to design a new, lightweight diesel-electric Type 4 locomotive to meet a British Railways&#x27; requirement for second generation Type 4 diesel locomotives. No single lightweight diesel engine was powerful enough, so the Falcon project used twin German-designed Maybach MD655 engines like those in the Class 52 &quot;Western&quot; diesel-hydraulic locomotives of the Western Region. These drove Brush generators and traction motors, rather than the hydraulic transmission of the &quot;Westerns&quot;. The engines of the &quot;Warships&quot; and &quot;Westerns&quot; were built under licence by Bristol Siddeley, part of Hawker Siddeley, who then purchased Brush Traction in 1957, making the licensed engines available to Brush.

The prototype, wearing a livery of lime green and chestnut brown and bearing the number D0280 after its Brush project number 280, emerged from Brush&#x27;s Loughborough works in September 1961. Initial testing took place on the Eastern Region, based at Finsbury Park, and the London Midland Region. Subsequently, the locomotive was transferred to the Western Region for power-unit performance testing, where it was tested up the Lickey Incline on 6 February 1962. Returning to Brush in March 1962, it received cast &quot;Falcon&quot; nameplates during an overhaul and upgrade lasting over a year.

Returning to British Railways in 1963, &quot;Falcon&quot; spent six months working out of Darnall shed, Sheffield, on passenger and freight trains, after which its testing was completed. Another year out of service followed, the locomotive returning in British Railways in two-tone green with half yellow ends and intended for active service. There was, by then, no chance of &quot;Falcon&quot; being the forerunner of a line of production locomotives. Advances in diesel engine technology made it obsolete almost from the beginning, with the development of larger and comparatively lightweight single powerplants. Brush Traction&#x27;s own single-engined Type 4 design, which became the BR Class 47, was the successful contender, with 512 locomotives eventually produced. &quot;Falcon&quot; was an evolutionary dead end - it was a functional locomotive, worth keeping in service, but there were never going to be more.

From 1965 onwards the locomotive, still owned by Brush, was under contract with British Railways so that operation and repair would be handled by them, with only major repairs being handed back to the builder. Allocated to Bristol Bath Road alongside the Class 52 &quot;Western&quot; fleet, the locomotive worked Paddington-Bristol diagrams with them. In 1970, British Rail bought the locomotive from Brush at its scrap value. BREL Swindon rebuilt it; air braking replaced vacuum braking, and it was repainted in corporate Rail Blue with full yellow ends with the new number 1200. Falcon was first allocated to Bristol Bath Road again working alongside Class 52s, and by March 1974 to Ebbw Junction, for use on iron ore trains. During its time at Ebbw Junction, the steam heating boiler was isolated.

In 1975, the locomotive was deemed uneconomic to operate due to its non-standard status and, despite efforts to preserve it, &quot;Falcon&quot; was broken up in March–April 1976 at Cashmore&#x27;s of Newport.

==Model railways==
In late 2007, Heljan introduced DCC-ready OO gauge models of &quot;Falcon&quot; in lime green, BR green and BR blue liveries, with a total production run of 2,400 items.

<text>The National Library of India is a library located in the Belvedere Estate, Alipore, Kolkata, India. It is India&#x27;s largest library by volume and public record. The National Library is under Ministry of Culture, Government of India. The library is designated to collect, disseminate and preserve printed material produced within India. With a collection in excess of 2.5 million books and records, it is the largest in the country.

== The Imperial Library ==
The Imperial Library was formed in 1891 by combining a number of Secretariat libraries in Calcutta. Of those, the most important and interesting was the library of the Home Department, which contained many books formerly belonging to the library of East India College, Fort William and the library of the East India Board in London. But, the use of the library was restricted to the superior officers of the Government. Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee was appointed as the president of imperial library council (1910) to which he donated his personal collection of 80,000 books arranged in a separate section.

== Declaring the Imperial Library as the National Library ==

After independence the Government of India changed the name of the Imperial Library to the National Library by &quot;Imperial Library (Change of Name) Act, 1948&quot;, and the collection was transferred from The Esplanade to the present Belvedere Estate. On 1 February 1953 the National Library was opened to the public by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. The name of &quot;National Library&quot; was changed to &quot;National Library of India&quot; by section 18 of the &quot;National Library of India Act, 1976&quot;.

The library collects book, periodicals, and titles in virtually all the Indian languages while the special collections in the National Library of India house at least fifteen languages. The Hindi department has books that date back all the way to the nineteenth century and the first ever books printed in that language. The collections break down and consist of 86,000 maps and 3,200 manuscripts.

== Discovery of hidden chamber ==
In 2010, the Ministry of Culture, the owner of the library, decided to get the library building restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). While taking stock of the library building, the conservation engineers discovered a previously unknown room. The secret ground-floor room, about 1000 sq. ft. in size, seems to have no opening of any kind.

The ASI archaeologists tried to search the first floor area (that forms the ceiling of the room) for a trap door, but found nothing. Since the building is of historical and cultural importance, ASI has decided to bore a hole through the wall instead of breaking it. There are speculations about the room being a punishment room used by Warren Hastings and other British officials, or a place to store treasure.

In 2011, the researchers announced that the room was filled entirely with mud, probably in an effort to stabilize the building.

== Visiting ==

The National Library is located on Belvedere Road in Alipore. It is open between 8.00 am and 8.00 pm on all working days and between 9.30 am and 6.00 pm on Saturdays, Sundays and Government of India holidays.

<text>Schmitt Gillenwater Kelly syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder consisting of radial hypoplasia, triphalangeal thumbs, hypospadias, and maxillary diastema.

== Discovery ==
It was first identified by Edward Schmitt, Jay Y. Gillenwater, Thadeus E. Kelly, and John M. Opitz in 1962, where they published their results in a case study. The family was found to be minimally restricted in normal functions, and lived relatively normal lives. The symptoms were consistent throughout all the members of the family, with the exception of all three of the boys having hypospadias.

== Radial Hypoplasia ==

=== Signs and Symptoms ===
The family had hypoplastic radii, which resulted in approximately 50% shorter radii. Because of this, the ulna was bowed outwards with outermost part of the ulna being pushed towards the skin. This resulted in a shorter reach.

=== Causes ===
Although more research is needed, the genetic cause of radial hypoplasia is believed to come from a rare allele of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene. This gene produces the Shh protein that induces development of the ulna, and the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers while increasing the expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), another signaling molecule, which induces development of the radius and thumb. Both Shh and FGF are widely expressed during early embryo development. When this rare allele of Shh gene is expressed, the result is reduced Shh protein production, which hampers FGF expression, potentially leading to radial hypoplasia.

=== Treatment and Prognosis ===
Treatment usually begins after birth and minor cases involve stretching, manipulation, and splinting. The goal of surgery is to increase length and straighten forearm and thumb reconstruction.

== Triphalangeal thumbs ==

=== Signs and Symptoms ===

Another symptom of the individuals with the syndrome was Bilaterally symmetrical triphalangeal thumbs had three phalanges rather than two, and a longer finger like appearance. The thumbs were non-opposable.

=== Causes ===
The cause of this condition is understood to be genetic in nature, but the exact mechanism is unknown. However, research has shown that the gene of interest is located in chromosome 7, with potential candidate genes including EN2 and the human homologs of mouse genes Hx and Hm.

=== Treatment and Prognosis ===
Surgery is done to correct any variations in the thumb and improve appearance; methods would vary on a case by case basis

== Hypospadia ==

=== Signs and Symptoms ===

In the males, Hypospadias was seen, which is the opening of the urethra was at the underside of the penis rather than at the tip.

=== Causes ===
Hypospadias can come about as a result of imbalances in the Wnt, Shh, Hox, and BMP pathways during fetal development. The Wnt, Shh, Hox, and BMP families are widely expressed throughout development. During the development of male external genitalia, Shh acts as a central cue, indirectly activating Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 by binding to the Patched receptor, and directly activating BMP2, Fgf10, Wnt5a, and BMP4. Fgf10 induces further Shh expression, while BMP4 represses Wnt5a expression. Rare allelic expression of any one of these genes can result in hypospadias.

=== Treatment and Prognosis ===
Minor forms do not require reconstructive surgery; Interventions include: correcting the location of urethral opening, repairing skin near the urethra opening, and straightening penile shaft.

== Maxillary diastema ==

=== Signs and Symptoms ===

The family also had Anterior Maxillary Diastema, a space between the upper incisors.

=== Causes ===
It highly likely this condition is caused by a genetic factor, but the exact gene is unknown.

=== Treatment and Prognosis ===
Treatment is centered around closing the gap between the incisors: either by veneers, braces, implants, or boding to conceal the gap.

== Similar diseases ==
Marfan syndrome - Is another autosomal dominant congenital condition. Symptoms consist of curved spine, thumb abnormalities, heart disease. Like Schmitt Gillenwater Kelly syndrome, surgery is done for cosmetic and reconstructive purposes. Unlike Schmitt GIllenwater Kelly Syndrome, Marfan syndrome has a higher likelihood of developing life-threatening complications.
