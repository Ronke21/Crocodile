<text>The list of security hacking incidents covers important or noteworthy events in the history of security hacking and cracking. 
==1900==
===1903===

* Magician and inventor Nevil Maskelyne disrupts John Ambrose Fleming&#x27;s public demonstration of Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s purportedly secure wireless telegraphy technology, sending insulting Morse code messages through the auditorium&#x27;s projector.

==1930s==

===1932===
* Polish cryptologists Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki broke the Enigma machine code.

===1939===
* Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman and Harold Keen worked together to develop the Bombe (on the basis of Rejewski&#x27;s works on Bomba). The Enigma machine&#x27;s use of a reliably small key space makes it vulnerable to brute force.

==1940s==
===1943===
* René Carmille, comptroller general of the Vichy French Army, hacked the punched card system used by the Nazis to locate Jews.

=== 1949 ===

*The theory that underlies computer viruses was first made public in 1949, when computer pioneer John von Neumann presented a paper titled &quot;Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata&quot;. In the paper, von Neumann speculated that computer programs could reproduce themselves.

==1950s==
===1955===
* At MIT, &quot;hack&quot; first came to mean playing with machines. The minutes of an April 1955 meeting of the Tech Model Railroad Club state that &quot;Mr. Eccles requests that anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn the power off to avoid fuse blowing.&quot;

===1957===
* Joe &quot;Joybubbles&quot; Engressia, a blind seven-year-old boy with perfect pitch, discovered that whistling the fourth E above middle C (a frequency of 2600 Hz) would interfere with AT&amp;T&#x27;s automated telephone systems, thereby inadvertently opening the door for phreaking.

==1960s==
* Various phreaking boxes are used to interact with automated telephone systems.

===1963===
* The first ever reference to malicious hacking is &#x27;telephone hackers&#x27; in MIT&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Tech&quot; of hackers tying up the lines with Harvard, configuring the PDP-1 to make free calls, war dialing and accumulating large phone bills.

===1965===
* William D. Mathews from MIT found a vulnerability in a CTSS running on an IBM 7094. The standard text editor on the system was designed to be used by one user at a time, working in one directory, and so it created a temporary file with a constant name for all instantiations of the editor. The flaw was discovered when two system programmers were editing at the same time and the temporary files for the message of the day and the password file became swapped, causing the contents of the system CTSS password file to display to any user logging into the system.

===1967===

* The first known incidence of network penetration hacking took place when members of a computer club at a suburban Chicago area high school were provided access to IBM&#x27;s APL network. In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through Science Research Associates) approached Evanston Township High School with the offer of four 2741 Selectric teletypewriter-based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language. The APL network system was structured into Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system&#x27;s wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:

==1970s==
===1971===
* John T. Draper (later nicknamed Captain Crunch), his friend Joe Engressia (also known as Joybubbles), and blue box phone phreaking hit the news with an &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine feature story.

===1979===
* Kevin Mitnick breaks into his first major computer system, the Ark, the computer system Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing their RSTS/E operating system software.

==1980s==
===1980===
* The FBI investigates a breach of security at National CSS (NCSS). &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reporting on the incident in 1981, describes hackers as

:The newspaper describes white hat activities as part of a &quot;mischievous but perversely positive &#x27;hacker&#x27; tradition&quot;. When a National CSS employee revealed the existence of his password cracker, which he had used on customer accounts, the company chastised him not for writing the software but for not disclosing it sooner. The letter of reprimand stated that &quot;The Company realizes the benefit to NCSS and in fact encourages the efforts of employees to identify security weaknesses to the VP, the directory, and other sensitive software in files&quot;.

===1981===
* Chaos Computer Club forms in Germany.
* Ian Murphy, aka Captain Zap, was the first cracker to be tried and convicted as a felon. Murphy broke into AT&amp;T&#x27;s computers in 1981 and changed the internal clocks that metered billing rates. People were getting late-night discount rates when they called at midday. Of course, the bargain-seekers who waited until midnight to call long distance were hit with high bills.

===1983===
*The 414s break into 60 computer systems at institutions ranging from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to Manhattan&#x27;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The incident appeared as the cover story of &quot;Newsweek&quot; with the title &quot;Beware: Hackers at play&quot;. As a result, the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on computer security and passed several laws.
* The group KILOBAUD is formed in February, kicking off a series of other hacker groups that formed soon after.
* The movie &quot;WarGames&quot; introduces the wider public to the phenomenon of hacking and creates a degree of mass paranoia about hackers and their supposed abilities to bring the world to a screeching halt by launching nuclear ICBMs.
* The U.S. House of Representatives begins hearings on computer security hacking.
* In his Turing Award lecture, Ken Thompson mentions &quot;hacking&quot; and describes a security exploit that he calls a &quot;Trojan horse&quot;.

===1984===
* Someone calling himself Lex Luthor founds the Legion of Doom. Named after a Saturday morning cartoon, the LOD had the reputation of attracting &quot;the best of the best&quot;—until one of the most talented members called Phiber Optik feuded with Legion of Doomer Erik Bloodaxe and got &#x27;tossed out of the clubhouse&#x27;. Phiber&#x27;s friends formed a rival group, the Masters of Deception.

The editor of &quot;2600&quot;, &quot;Emmanuel Goldstein&quot; (whose real name is Eric Corley), takes his handle from the leader of the resistance in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The publication provides tips for would-be hackers and phone phreaks, as well as commentary on the hacker issues of the day. Today, copies of &quot;2600&quot; are sold at most large retail bookstores.
* The Chaos Communication Congress, the annual European hacker conference organized by the Chaos Computer Club, is held in Hamburg, Germany.
* William Gibson&#x27;s groundbreaking science fiction novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, about &quot;Case&quot;, a futuristic computer hacker, is published.

===1985===
* KILOBAUD is re-organized into The P.H.I.R.M. and begins sysopping hundreds of BBSs throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.
* The online &#x27;zine &quot;Phrack&quot; is established.
* &quot;The Hacker&#x27;s Handbook&quot; is published in the UK.
* The FBI, Secret Service, Middlesex County NJ Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and various local law enforcement agencies execute seven search warrants concurrently across New Jersey on July 12, 1985, seizing equipment from BBS operators and users alike for &quot;complicity in computer theft&quot;, under a newly passed, and yet untested criminal statute. This is famously known as the Private Sector Bust, or the 2600 BBS Seizure, and implicated the Private Sector BBS sysop, Store Manager (also a BBS sysop), Beowulf, Red Barchetta, The Vampire, the NJ Hack Shack BBS sysop, and the Treasure Chest BBS sysop.

===1986===
* After more and more break-ins to government and corporate computers, Congress passes the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a crime to break into computer systems. The law, however, does not cover juveniles.
* Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold are convicted of accessing the Telecom Gold account belonging to the Duke of Edinburgh under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 in the United Kingdom, the first conviction for illegally accessing a computer system. On appeal, the conviction is overturned as hacking is not within the legal definition of forgery.
* Arrest of a hacker who calls himself The Mentor. He published a now-famous treatise shortly after his arrest that came to be known as the Hacker Manifesto in the e-zine Phrack. This still serves as the most famous piece of hacker literature and is frequently used to illustrate the mindset of hackers.

===1990===
* Operation Sundevil introduced. After a prolonged sting investigation, Secret Service agents swoop down on organizers and prominent members of BBSs in 14 U.S. cities including the Legion of Doom, conducting early-morning raids and arrests. The arrests involve and are aimed at cracking down on credit-card theft and telephone and wire fraud. The result is a breakdown in the hacking community, with members informing on each other in exchange for immunity. The offices of Steve Jackson Games are also raided, and the role-playing sourcebook GURPS Cyberpunk is confiscated, possibly because the government fears it is a &quot;handbook for computer crime&quot;. Legal battles arise that prompt the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, including the trial of Knight Lightning.

* November and December: On November 24, Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba&#x27;s Cloud Security Team reported a zero-day vulnerability (later dubbed Log4Shell) involving the use of arbitrary code execution in the ubiquitous Java logging framework software Log4j. The report was privately disclosed to project developers of Log4j, a team at The Apache Software Foundation, on November 24. On December 8, Zhaojun contacted the developers again detailing how the vulnerability was being discussed in public security chat rooms, was already known by some security researchers, and pleaded that the team expedite the solution to the vulnerability in the official release version of Log4j. Early exploitations were noticed on Minecraft servers on December 9; however, forensic analysis indicates that Log4Shell may have been exploited as early as December 1 or 2nd. Due to the ubiquity of devices with the Log4j software (hundreds of millions) and the simplicity in executing the vulnerability, it is considered to be arguably one of the largest and most critical vulnerabilities ever. Yet, big names in security hacking helped in regaining control over server, like Graham Ivan Clark, and Elhamy A. Elsebaey. A portion of the vulnerability was fixed in a patch distributed on December 6, three days before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 9.

<doc id="421425" wikidata="Q5149031" url="?curid=421425" title="Colorblind James Experience">
<text>Colorblind James Experience was an American alternative roots/pop/rock band. Bandleader and singer/songwriter/guitarist &quot;Colorblind&quot; James Charles Cuminale was originally from Rochester, New York, but assembled early versions of what would become the Experience in Oswego, New York, before relocating to San Francisco, California. After a couple years of mixed results there, the band regrouped and moved again, this time back to Rochester which remained its home base until Cuminale&#x27;s premature death in 2001. The band enjoyed brief fame in the UK and Europe after BBC DJ John Peel gave the Experience some exposure. Their &quot;Dance Critters&quot; single reached number 10 on the UK Indie Chart, while their albums &quot;Colorblind James Experience&quot; and &quot;Why Should I Stand Up&quot; reached numbers 5 and 13 respectively.

Often humorous (&quot;The music stopped. And then it started again.&quot;) and parodic, and just as often laced with a profoundly questioning spirituality; their music blended elements of polka, country, cocktail jazz, blues, rockabilly, Tex-Mex, rock and roll and other genres. The band&#x27;s sound was to a large extent inspired by the &quot;old, weird America&quot; chased by Bob Dylan and The Band during their Basement Tapes period, but other prominent influences included Ray Charles, Randy Newman, and Van Morrison.

Their line-up changed repeatedly over the years, and their third album was released under the name of Colorblind James and the Death Valley Boys.

== History ==
===1978-1981: Formation===
The Colorblind James Experience began as Colorblind James &amp; The White Caps. While primarily based around the original songs of Chuck Cuminale, a.k.a. Colorblind James, the band also featured original songs by lead guitarist G. Elwyn Meixner. Rounding out the line-up were Rush Tattered, née Russell Tarby, on lead vocals, Kevin McDevitt on drums and Terry O’Neill on bass.

The band was formed in Oswego, New York, and christened the White Caps in homage to both Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps as well as the ubiquitous white caps of Lake Ontario. It was an immediate hit drawing a large and loyal following to the Market House Music Hall located on Oswego&#x27;s Water Street. The songs were mostly executed in a fast and frantic two-beat style propelled by Kevin McDevitt&#x27;s manic and ferocious drumming.

===1980-1984: From Oswego to San Francisco, San Francisco to Rochester===
In the summer of 1980, after enjoying two years of success in their hometown, Cuminale looked west to San Francisco as the ‘next step’ for the band. Inviting the entire band to join him, he was surprised to find only McDevitt was eager to make the trip. He recruited Phil Marshall to take over on guitar and Gene Tighe to play bass. In the fall of 1980, the four members caravaned west with Marshall and McDevitt arriving the day after Thanksgiving.

During the band&#x27;s time in San Francisco, Tighe was replaced by Oswego native Thad Iorizzo who was, in turn, replaced by Dan O&#x27;Donnell and then Dave Fisher. The band released one 45rpm record, &quot;Talk To Me&quot; b/w &quot;Kojak Chair&quot; to little critical or commercial success. In the summer of 1984, the band dissolved and Cuminale and his wife moved back east to Rochester, New York. Guitarist Phil Marshall rejoined the band a few months later.

In Rochester, the band included former White Caps guitarist G. Elwyn, bassist Bernie Heveron (an alumnus of Personal Effects) and Jim McAvaney on drums. The band scraped together enough money to press 1000 copies of its debut self-titled LP in 1987. Cuminale sent one copy abroad and specifically to BBC Radio&#x27;s John Peel. The song &quot;Considering a Move to Memphis&quot; made Peel&#x27;s year end Festive Fifty list.

===1987: Record contract (Fundamental/Red Rhino)===
The band was signed to Fundamental Records in the US and its sister company, Red Rhino, in the UK. Prior to touring, G. Elwyn left the band, followed shortly by Bernie Heveron. Auditions were held and the remaining trio were joined by David McIntire on clarinet/sax, John Ebert on trombone and Ken Frank on bass.

===1988-1990: Fame in the UK: the touring years===
On October 17, 1988, the band landed at Heathrow Airport ready to embark on what would be the first of three European tours.

The band followed up its debut LP with &quot;Why Should I Stand Up?&quot;, which was released on Cooking Vinyl in the UK and Capitol subsidiary Gold Castle in the States. The all-acoustic album &quot;Strange Sounds From the Basement&quot; was released only in the UK and found the band working under the name Colorblind James and the Death Valley Boys, though they were subsequently dropped by Cooking Vinyl and Gold Castle.

===1991-1993: American success eludes the band===
The release of &quot;Solid! Behind The Times&quot; on the US folk label Red House found the band without a UK label for the first time. While Red House pinned their hopes on the CD&#x27;s success, the band was not in a position to tour the States extensively since the time between 1991 and 1993 found many long-time members leaving the band.

===1993-2001: The post-touring years===
The release of &quot;I Could Be Your Guide&quot; found Cuminale and McAvaney joined by Gary Holt on bass, Tommy Tramontana on guitar, “Brother” Charles Jaffe on keyboards, Rita Coulter on vocals, and Ethan Lyons on saxophone. That CD was followed by the final studio CD, titled &quot;Call Of The Wild&quot; (1999).

Chuck Cuminale died of arrhythmia in July 2001.

On July 8, 2008, a tribute to Chuck and his music was performed by an ensemble composed of musicians who had played with various incarnations of the band, as well as Chuck&#x27;s son Mark on guitar. The performance was recorded for WXXI&#x27;s OnStage.

<text>David Gascoyne (10 October 1916 – 25 November 2001) was an English poet associated with the Surrealist movement, in particular the British Surrealist Group. Additionally he translated work by French surrealist poets.

==Early life and surrealism==
Gascoyne was born in Harrow the eldest of three sons of Leslie Noel Gascoyne (1886–1969), a bank clerk, and his wife, Winifred Isobel, née Emery (1890–1972). His mother, a niece of the actors Cyril Maude and Winifred Emery, was one of two young women present when the dramatist W. S. Gilbert died in his lake at Grim&#x27;s Dyke in May 1911. Gascoyne grew up in England and Scotland, attending Salisbury Cathedral School and London&#x27;s Regent Street Polytechnic. He spent some of the early 1930s in Paris.

Gascoyne&#x27;s first book, &quot;Roman Balcony and Other Poems&quot;, appeared in 1932, when he was 16. A novel, &quot;Opening Day&quot; was published the following year. However, it was &quot;Man&#x27;s Life is This Meat&quot; (1936), collecting his early surrealism and translations of French surrealists, and &quot;Hölderlin&#x27;s Madness&quot; (1938) that established his reputation. These, with his 1935 &quot;A Short Survey of Surrealism&quot; and his work on the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition, which he helped to organise, made him one of a small group of English surrealists that included Hugh Sykes Davies and Roger Roughton. At the exhibition, Gascoyne had to use a spanner to rescue Salvador Dalí from a deep-sea diving suit he had worn to give his lecture.

==Political outlook==
Gascoyne was an active anti-fascist, who took part in several protests against the British Union of Fascists in London&#x27;s East End. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1936 and travelled to Spain, where he broadcast some radio talks for the Barcelona-based propaganda ministry. However, he soon became disillusioned with the Communists&#x27; treatment of the POUM and the Spanish Anarchists and left the party. Gascoyne had become friends with Charles Madge and through him became involved in the Mass Observation movement.

The diaries Gascoyne kept for six years from 1936 projected an existentialist auto-criticism, recording with honesty his acute emotional and spiritual crises, his struggle to accept his sexual identity as a homosexual, and his affairs. Apart from his involvement with communism and Mass-Observation, he had friendships with Dylan Thomas, Kathleen Raine, Lawrence Durrell, Henry Miller and others. Also apparent is strong engagement with existentialist philosophy.

When later interviewed for the book &quot;Authors Take Sides on the Falklands&quot;, Gascoyne expressed strong opposition to the Falklands War.

==Later life and works==
Gascoyne spent the years just before World War II in Paris, where he became friends with Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, André Breton, Paul Éluard and Pierre Jean Jouve. His poetry of this period appeared in &quot;Poems 1937–1942&quot; (1943) with illustrations by Graham Sutherland.

His poem &quot;Requiem&quot;, dedicated to the future victims of war, was written for his friend Priaulx Rainier to set to music. Her &quot;Requiem&quot; was first heard in 1956. She died on Gascoyne&#x27;s 70th birthday, 10 October 1986.

Gascoygne returned to France after the war and lived there at intervals until the mid-1960s. His work from the 1950s appeared in &quot;A Vagrant and Other Poems&quot; (1950), and &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; (1956). These moved away from surrealism towards a more metaphysical and religious approach.

After suffering a mental breakdown, Gascoyne returned to England to spend the rest of his life on the Isle of Wight. He appears to have written little by then. Publication continued due to various &quot;rediscoveries&quot; of his works, with several collections and selections from Oxford University Press, Enitharmon and other imprints. Two books of his journals were returned to him after being lost for some time and were published in separate volumes by Alan Clodd at Enitharmon Press. When a third book was found, a collection including the additional material was edited by Lucien Jenkins for Skoob Books Publishing. For this Gascoyne himself provided what he called a &quot;postface&quot;, one of the most extended pieces of writing from his later years.

In 1996, with the editorial assistance of Roger Scott, Gascoyne penned a tribute to his late friend of sixty years George Barker entitled &quot;The Fire of Vision&quot;, privately printed by Alan Anderson for Alan Clodd.

It was in Whitecroft Hospital on the Isle of Wight that Gascoyne met his wife, Judy Lewis, in a remarkable coincidence. Judy explains:
:One of my favourite poems was called &quot;September Sun&quot;. I read it one afternoon and one of the patients came up to me afterwards and said &quot;I wrote that.&quot; I put my hand on his shoulder and said &quot;Of course you did, dear.&quot; Then of course when I got to know him I realised he had.

They married in 1975. David Gascoyne died on 25 November 2001 at the age of 85.

==Reputation==
In a poetic field dominated by W. H. Auden and other more political and social poets, the surrealist group tended to be overlooked by critics and the public. He among others was lampooned by Dylan Thomas in &quot;Letter to my Aunt.&quot; Although &quot;Poems 1937–1942&quot; (illustrated by Graham Sutherland and edited by Tambimuttu) received critical acclaim at the time, it was only with renewed interest in experimental writing associated with the British Poetry Revival that their work began to be discussed again. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1988. Work of his was included in the Revival anthology &quot;Conductors of Chaos&quot; (1996).

In later years, Gascoyne seemed remarkably resigned to not altogether achieving in poetry what he had set out to do when young, and not sustaining a remarkable early promise. Still, he was pleased whenever he received critical notice. In his later years his attention was drawn to a balanced assessment of his work by Martin Seymour-Smith in his immense &quot;Guide to Modern World Literature&quot; (Macmillan), and he was gratified by the tone of the commentary and the assertion that he was still widely read. A tribute volume, &quot;For David Gascoyne On His Sixty-Fifth Birthday&quot;, appeared in 1981 with contributions from 26 poets, including Adrian Henri, Lawrence Durrell, and Michael Hamburger.

<doc id="421437" wikidata="Q14401" url="?curid=421437" title="Kappa">
<text>Kappa (; uppercase Κ, lowercase κ or cursive ; , &quot;káppa&quot;) is the tenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless velar plosive sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, has a value of 20. It was derived from the Phoenician letter kaph . Letters that arose from kappa include the Roman K and Cyrillic К. The uppercase form is identical to the Latin K.

Greek proper names and placenames containing kappa are often written in English with &quot;c&quot; due to the Romans&#x27; transliterations into the Latin alphabet: Constantinople, Corinth, Crete. All formal modern romanizations of Greek now use the letter &quot;k&quot;, however.
The cursive form is generally a simple font variant of lower-case kappa, but it is encoded separately in Unicode for occasions where it is used as a separate symbol in math and science. In mathematics, the kappa curve is named after this letter; the tangents of this curve were first calculated by Isaac Barrow in the 17th century.

==Symbol==
===Lowercase (κ)===
;Mathematics and statistics
* In graph theory, the connectivity of a graph is given by &quot;κ&quot;.
* In differential geometry, the curvature of a curve is given by &quot;κ&quot;.

<doc id="421440" wikidata="Q14412" url="?curid=421440" title="Rho">
<text>Rho (; uppercase Ρ, lowercase ρ or ; or ) is the seventeenth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 100. It is derived from Phoenician letter res . Its uppercase form uses the same glyph, Ρ, as the distinct Latin letter P; the two letters have different Unicode encodings.

== Uses ==
===Greek===
Rho is classed as a liquid consonant (together with Lambda and sometimes the nasals Mu and Nu), which has important implications for morphology. In both Ancient and Modern Greek, it represents an alveolar trill , alveolar tap , or alveolar approximant .

In polytonic orthography, a rho at the beginning of a word is almost always written ⟨⟩ (&quot;rh&quot;) with a rough breathing mark, indicating that it is voiceless. Very rarely, it is written ⟨⟩ (&quot;r&quot;) with a smooth breathing mark, indicating that it is voiced, instead. Rho is not written with breathing marks at any other place in a word, where it is always voiced, with the exception of double rho, which was traditionally written ⟨⟩ (&quot;rrh&quot;), with a smooth breathing mark over the first rho, and a rough breathing mark over the second, representing a geminated voiceless consonant. However, this practice fell out of use over the 19th century in favour of ⟨⟩, since double rho cannot take any other combination of breathing marks. Various Greek-derived English words containing &quot;rh&quot; and &quot;rrh&quot; derive from words containing ⟨⟩ and ⟨⟩.

The name of the letter is written in Greek as (polytonic) or ρω/ (monotonic).

===Other alphabets===
Letters that arose from rho include Roman R and Cyrillic Er (Р).

=== Mathematics and science ===
The characters ρ and are also conventionally used outside the Greek alphabetical context in science and mathematics.
*In the physical sciences to represent:
**Densities: mass density, air density or charge density (&quot;ρ&quot;)
**Resistivity (&quot;ρ&quot;)
**Rho meson (ρ+, ρ−, ρ0)
**General quantum states
**Hammett Equation, ρ is used to represent the reaction constant, this is independent of the position and nature of the substituents of the benzene ring.
*In mathematics to represent:
**A length coordinate in polar, cylindrical, spherical, and toroidal coordinate systems, and toroidal and poloidal coordinates of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.
**The correlation coefficient of a population parameter
**The spectral radius of a matrix formula_1 denoted as formula_2
**The plastic ratio
**The prime constant
**The sensitivity to interest rates of a pricing function
**The expected return of a given policy (formula_3) in reinforcement learning, denoted formula_4
**The rename operation in relational algebra
*In economics to represent the discount rate of future cash flows
*In molecular biology to represent the Rho protein responsible for termination of RNA synthesis. In such occasions, it is often represented as , to avoid confusion with the Latin letter &quot;p&quot;
*In molecular biology to represent the Rho family of GTPases, important for cytoskeletal dynamic regulation.
*In ecology to represent the population damping ratio where ρ = λ1 / |λ2|.
*In computer programming
**The lower-case rho &quot;⍴&quot; means reshape in the APL programming language, and by extension also queries shape
**The lower-case rho &quot;ρ&quot; is used for the unary rename operation in relational algebra
*In statistics to represent Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient, commonly known as Spearman&#x27;s rho
*In options theory to represent the rate of change of a portfolio with respect to interest rates

=== Chi Rho (☧) ===

The letter rho overlaid with chi forms the &quot;Chi Rho&quot; symbol, used to represent Jesus Christ. It was first used by Emperor Constantine the Great. A can be seen on his standard known as the Labarum.

===Rho with stroke (ϼ)===
The rho with a stroke through its tail is used for abbreviations involving rho, most notably in for as a unit of measurement.

<text>Psi (uppercase &#x27;, lowercase &#x27; or ; &quot;psi&quot; ) is the twenty-third and penultimate letter of the Greek alphabet and is associated with a numeric value of 700. In both Classical and Modern Greek, the letter indicates the combination (as in English word &quot;lapse&quot;).

For Greek loanwords in Latin and modern languages with Latin alphabets, psi is usually transliterated as &quot;ps&quot;.

The letter&#x27;s origin is uncertain. It may or may not derive from the Phoenician alphabet. It appears in the 7th century BC, expressing in the Eastern alphabets, but in the Western alphabets (the sound expressed by Χ in the Eastern alphabets). In writing, the early letter appears in an angular shape ().
There were early graphical variants that omitted the stem (&quot;chickenfoot-shaped psi&quot; as: or ).

The Western letter (expressing , later ) was adopted into the Old Italic alphabets, and its shape is also continued into the Algiz rune &lt;ᛉ&gt; of the Elder Futhark. 

Psi, or its Arcadian variant or was adopted in the Latin alphabet in the form of &quot;Antisigma&quot; (Ↄ, ↃC, or 𐌟) during the reign of Emperor Claudius as one of the three Claudian letters. However, it was abandoned after his death.

The classical Greek letter was adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet as &quot;Ѱ&quot;.

==Use as a symbol==
The letter psi is commonly used in physics to represent wave functions in quantum mechanics, such as in the Schrödinger equation and bra–ket notation: formula_1. It is also used to represent the (generalized) positional states of a qubit in a quantum computer.

Psi is also used as the symbol for the polygamma function, defined by
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the gamma function.

The letters Ψ or ψ can also be a symbol for:
*Psychology, psychiatry, and sometimes parapsychology (involving paranormal or relating with the supernatural subjects, especially research into extrasensory perception).
*In mathematics, the reciprocal Fibonacci constant, the division polynomials, and the supergolden ratio.
*In mathematics, the second Chebyshev function
*Water potential in movement of water between plant cells.
*In biochemistry, it denotes pseudouridine, an uncommon nucleoside.
*Stream function in fluid mechanics defining the curve to which the flow velocity is always tangent.
*One of the dihedral angles in the backbones of proteins.
*Indiana University (as a superimposed I and U).
*A sai, the name of which is pronounced the same way in English.
*Pharmacology, general pharmacy.
*In virology the ψ site is a viral packaging signal.
*The J/ψ meson, in particle physics.
*In the computability theory, formula_4 represents the return value formula_5 of a program formula_6.
*In circadian physiology, ψ represents the phase relationship between a zeitgeber and a biological rhythm.
*In building, to represent an adjustment to a U-value, accounting for thermal bridge effects.
*The ordinal collapsing function and notation developed by Wilfried Buchholz.
*In Biblical studies, as an abbreviation for the book of Psalms.

<doc id="421453" wikidata="Q1176760" url="?curid=421453" title="David Strickland">
<text>David Gordon Strickland, Jr. (October 14, 1969 – March 22, 1999) was an American actor. He was best known for playing the boyish rock music reporter Todd Stites in the NBC sitcom &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;.

==Life and career==
David Gordon Strickland, Jr., was born on October 14, 1969, in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York. His parents, David Gordon Sr. and Karen, both worked as executives. Strickland moved with his family to Princeton, New Jersey, and later to Los Angeles, where he became an actor. Strickland guest starred in the television series &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, until he landed his role on &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; in 1996.

==Personal life==

Strickland suffered from bipolar disorder and had a long and troubled history of drug and alcohol abuse. Five months before his death, Strickland was arrested for cocaine possession, pleaded no contest, and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and ordered into drug rehabilitation. He was due in court for a progress report on the day of his death. News reports of events leading up to Strickland&#x27;s death suggest that he had chosen to stop taking the lithium he was prescribed to control his bipolar disorder.

==Death==
On March 20, 1999, Strickland and comedian Andy Dick flew from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and spent three days partying in strip clubs. After checking into a motel, Strickland spent time with a prostitute, consumed six bottles of beer, and then hanged himself with a bed sheet over the ceiling beam. He died during the morning hours of March 22, 1999, at the age of 29. His body was discovered by a private investigator hired by his friend and co-star Brooke Shields when Strickland missed his appearance in Los Angeles Municipal Court for cocaine possession. Evidence of drug use was found in his room. The Clark County Coroner concluded that Strickland&#x27;s body bore the marks of a previous suicide attempt.

After much discussion, the writers of &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; decided to deal with Strickland&#x27;s death directly by killing off his character, Todd Stites. In the show&#x27;s third season finale, &quot;A Day in a Life&quot;, Todd fails to appear at work one day. When Susan calls Todd regarding tickets to a show, his pager vibrates on his desk. Susan spends the day searching for Todd, learning for the first time about a number of good deeds he had done throughout his life. The episode ends when the police call Jack while he, Susan, and the other characters are gathered in a prayer circle for Todd&#x27;s well-being. The details of Todd&#x27;s death are left ambiguous. The episode is peppered with confessional-style monologues delivered directly into the camera by Shields and the show&#x27;s supporting cast.

Oak Cliff originated on December 15, 1886, when John S. Armstrong and Thomas L. Marsalis bought a farm of on the west side of the Trinity River for $8,000. The farm was subdivided into blocks, and the plat of the new town made. Armstrong and Marsalis began to develop the land into an elite residential area, which proved to be a success by the end of 1887, with sales surpassing $60,000. After a disagreement between the partners, Marsalis secured complete control over Oak Cliff&#x27;s development. Armstrong would go on to create his own elite residential development on the north side of Dallas, known as Highland Park.

According to the first plat filed, the original township of Oak Cliff extended as far north as First Street, later named Colorado Boulevard just north of Lake Cliff, then known as Spring Lake, and as far south as a pavilion below Thirteenth Street. It was bounded on the east by Miller Street, later named Cliff Street, and on the west by Beckley Avenue. Jefferson Boulevard was the route of a steam railroad, and the principal north and south thoroughfare was Marsalis Avenue, then called Grand Street.

On November 1, 1887, $23,000 worth of lots were sold in the newly opened Marsalis Addition (Oak Cliff) before noon, and on the following day, ninety-one lots were sold for $38,113. Figures published later in November gave the new suburb a population of 500. Marsalis developed the Oak Cliff Elevated Railway to provide the first transportation link to his new development, using a small shuttle train pulled by a &quot;dummy&quot; engine. The transportation system was modeled on one in the city of New York and was promoted as &quot;the first elevated railway in the South&quot;. The railroad ran special trains to Oak Cliff Park the home ground of the Dallas Hams. In reality, the railroad operated at ground level almost its entire course down Jefferson Boulevard and towards Lake Cliff; it only became slightly elevated as it crossed the Trinity River. This steam railway was continued for many years for commuters and pleasure seekers. Marsalis began two other development projects with the intent to promote Oak Cliff as a vacation resort. One was Oak Cliff Park, later called Marsalis Park and Zoo, a park that included a two-mile (3 km)-long lake and a 2,000-seat pavilion in which dances and operas were held. Another was the Park Hotel, modeled after the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, which included several mineral baths fed by artesian wells.
Oak Cliff incorporated in 1890 with a population of 2,470, and secured a post office which operated until 1896. The community had four grocery stores, two meat markets, a hardware store, and a feed store. Businesses included the Texas Paper Mills Company (later Fleming and Sons), the Oak Cliff Planing Mill, the Oak Cliff Artesian Well Company, Patton&#x27;s Medicinal Laboratories, and the Oak Cliff Ice and Refrigeration Company. A number of new elite residential areas developed by the Dallas Land and Loan Company had pushed the community&#x27;s boundaries westward to Willomet Street. Oak Cliff&#x27;s first mayor was Hugh Ewing. In 1891 the community&#x27;s first newspaper, the Oak Cliff Sunday Weekly, was published by F. N. Oliver.

Over the next three years Oak Cliff&#x27;s development continued, but, during the depression of 1893, the demand for vacation resorts decreased, and the community&#x27;s growth stagnated, forcing Marsalis into bankruptcy. Consequently, the Park Hotel was converted into the Oak Cliff College for Young Ladies. Another educational institution, the Patton Seminary, was established two years later by Dr. Edward G. Patton. By 1900 Oak Cliff was already no longer an elite residential and vacation community. Many of the lots once owned by the Dallas Land and Loan Company were subdivided by the Dallas and Oak Cliff Real Estate Company and sold to the middle and working classes, a trend which lasted well into the early 1900s. The census of 1900 reported Oak Cliff&#x27;s population as 3,640.

In 1902, an interurban electric streetcar line controlled by the Northern Texas Traction Company, was constructed passing through Oak Cliff, and connected Dallas to Fort Worth. This line discontinued service in the late 1930s. Smaller residential streetcar service ran throughout Oak Cliff&#x27;s neighborhoods, spanning over . Known as a streetcar suburb, Oak Cliff&#x27;s characteristic twists and turns are largely due to the area&#x27;s topography, and the paths and turnabouts created by the streetcar service. Residential streetcar service ended in January 1956.

Oak Cliff was annexed by Dallas in 1903, after numerous attempts beginning in 1900. The proposal had met with little success, until the community&#x27;s depressed economy produced a vote in favor of annexation by eighteen votes.
In April 1908, the Trinity River flooded its banks, rising to a height of by April 21; rains continued into May, finally raising the river&#x27;s height to . The only bridge remaining that connected Oak Cliff with Dallas after the flood was the Zang Boulevard Turnpike, an earthen fill with a single steel span across the river channel, slightly to the north of the present Houston Street Viaduct. About this time, George B. Dealey, publisher of the Morning News, returned from a trip to Kansas City with the idea of securing for Dallas an intracity causeway similar to the one there. From his proposal sprang the Houston Street Viaduct (originally named the Oak Cliff Viaduct), begun October 24, 1910, and opened to traffic February 22, 1912, acclaimed as the longest concrete bridge in the world. (This latter designation was later disputed as a publicity stunt.)

In 1909, a disastrous fire occurred in Oak Cliff, consuming fourteen blocks of residences, including the Briggs Sanitorium.

In April 1921, the Ku Klux Klan declared a chapter within Dallas, making themselves known by not only beating and branding a local black hotel elevator operator, but by also parading in downtown Dallas with nearly 800 hooded Klansmen in attendance. The Dallas chapter, known as “Klavern 66”, moved its meeting hall into Oak Cliff due to a large increase in members shortly after being announced. Klavern 66 was able to spread their influence by producing their own newspaper, &quot;Texas 100% American&quot;, which was projected to circulate approximately 18,000 copies. In March 1922, another well-known Ku Klux Klan beating occurred, this time in Oak Cliff, against a tailor named W. J. Gilbert, as reported by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

The Great Depression caused Dallas’ economy to suffer, resulting in the Oak Cliff&#x27;s black community contributing to approximately one-half of the city&#x27;s unemployment population. As black people were known to be considered first for layoffs, a need for low-income housing quickly rose. As a result, 86% of Oak Cliff&#x27;s black population was forced into inhabiting sub-standard housing, commonly located on what was considered as the most undesirable and unlivable parts of Dallas. Violence broke out in Oak Cliff between its black and white citizens over the issue at hand. The Dallas mayor at the time, Woodall Rodgers, was documented as criticizing Oak Cliff&#x27;s black community for inciting the violence and not being accepting of their residential segregation.

On April 2, 1957, a tornado ripped through Oak Cliff as part of the Early-April 1957 tornado outbreak sequence, killing 10 people and causing more than $1 million in damages.

== Education ==
===School desegregation===
In apprehension to the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling in 1954, the city of Dallas resisted desegregating their schools with the help of federal judges such as Judge William H. Atwell, the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. To combat the inevitability of desegregation of schools, Dallas, in 1961, initiated a &quot;Stairstep Plan&quot;. The proposed plan stated that all DISD schools would begin desegregation one grade level per year, beginning with the first grade. DISD declared all of their schools desegregated in 1967, which was later found to be inherently false. In July 1971, it was discovered that out of the total 180 DISD schools, 159 schools met the criteria to be classified as a one-race school (90% of the student population being either Black, Mexican American or Anglo). At the conclusion of the case in August 1971, Judge William M. Taylor of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, ruled in favor of a majority-to-minority transfer program. The program stated that all DISD students who attended schools where their race made up the majority of the student population would integrate into schools where their race was a minority by offering free transportation by bus. For the next few decades Oak Cliff schools, along with those in South Dallas, became the focus of a long-running and bitter court battle over desegregation, one overseen by federal judge Barefoot Sanders. All of DISD&#x27;s schools were officially declared desegregated by the city in 2003.

Oak Cliff is the home of the Texas Theatre, located in West Jefferson Boulevard, where former resident Lee Harvey Oswald, the man suspected of killing U.S. President John F. Kennedy and shooting Dallas Police officer JD Tippit at 10th and Patton Streets, was arrested. The theater has appeared in many books and movies on the Kennedy assassination, including Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film, &quot;JFK&quot;. On November 22, 1963, Warren &quot;Butch&quot; Burroughs, who ran the concession stand at the theatre, said that Oswald came into the theater between 1:00 and 1:07 pm; he also claimed he sold Oswald popcorn at 1:15 p.m. Julia Postal later said that Burroughs initially told her the same thing although he later denied this. Theatre patron, Jack Davis, also corroborated Burroughs&#x27; time, claiming he observed Oswald in the theatre prior to 1:20 pm.

Oak Cliff is the setting of &quot;City Limit&quot;, the novel by Lantzee Miller is a coming-of-age story and metaphorical portrait of the beginning of Oak Cliff&#x27;s recent rebirth and self redefinition.

<doc id="421463" wikidata="Q7048840" url="?curid=421463" title="Non-analytic smooth function">
<text>In mathematics, smooth functions (also called infinitely differentiable functions) and analytic functions are two very important types of functions. One can easily prove that any analytic function of a real argument is smooth. The converse is not true, as demonstrated with the counterexample below.

One of the most important applications of smooth functions with compact support is the construction of so-called mollifiers, which are important in theories of generalized functions, such as Laurent Schwartz&#x27;s theory of distributions.

The existence of smooth but non-analytic functions represents one of the main differences between differential geometry and analytic geometry. In terms of sheaf theory, this difference can be stated as follows: the sheaf of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold is fine, in contrast with the analytic case.

The functions below are generally used to build up partitions of unity on differentiable manifolds.

==An example function==
===Definition of the function===

Consider the function

:formula_1

defined for every real number &quot;x&quot;.

===The function is smooth===

The function &quot;f&quot; has continuous derivatives of all orders at every point &quot;x&quot; of the real line. The formula for these derivatives is

:formula_2

where &quot;pn&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; − 1 given recursively by &quot;p&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 and

:formula_3

for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;. From this formula, it is not completely clear that the derivatives are continuous at 0; this follows from the one-sided limit 

:formula_4

for any nonnegative integer &quot;m&quot;.

By the power series representation of the exponential function, we have for every natural number formula_5 (including zero)

:formula_6

because all the positive terms for formula_7 are added. Therefore, dividing this inequality by formula_8 and taking the limit from above,

:formula_9

We now prove the formula for the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of &quot;f&quot; by mathematical induction. Using the chain rule, the reciprocal rule, and the fact that the derivative of the exponential function is again the exponential function, we see that the formula is correct for the first derivative of &quot;f&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 and that &quot;p&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree 0. Of course, the derivative of &quot;f&quot; is zero for &quot;x&quot; &lt; 0.
It remains to show that the right-hand side derivative of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;x&quot; = 0 is zero. Using the above limit, we see that

:formula_10

The induction step from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;n&quot; + 1 is similar. For &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 we get for the derivative
:formula_11

where &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; = (&quot;n&quot; + 1) − 1. Of course, the (&quot;n&quot; + 1)st derivative of &quot;f&quot; is zero for &quot;x&quot; &lt; 0. For the right-hand side derivative of &quot;f&quot; (&quot;n&quot;) at &quot;x&quot; = 0 we obtain with the above limit

:formula_12
===The function is not analytic===
As seen earlier, the function &quot;f&quot; is smooth, and all its derivatives at the origin are 0. Therefore, the Taylor series of &quot;f&quot; at the origin converges everywhere to the zero function,

:formula_13

and so the Taylor series does not equal &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0. Consequently, &quot;f&quot; is not analytic at the origin. 

===Smooth transition functions===

The function

:formula_14

has a strictly positive denominator everywhere on the real line, hence &quot;g&quot; is also smooth. Furthermore, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 for &quot;x&quot; ≤ 0 and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 for &quot;x&quot; ≥ 1, hence it provides a smooth transition from the level 0 to the level 1 in the unit interval [0, 1]. To have the smooth transition in the real interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] with &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;, consider the function

:formula_15

For real numbers , the smooth function

:formula_16

equals 1 on the closed interval [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] and vanishes outside the open interval (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), hence it can serve as a bump function.

==A smooth function that is nowhere real analytic==
A more pathological example is an infinitely differentiable function which is not analytic &quot;at any point&quot;. It can be constructed by means of a Fourier series as follows. Define for all formula_17
:formula_18

Since the series formula_19 converges for all formula_20, this function is easily seen to be of class C∞, by a standard inductive application of the Weierstrass M-test to demonstrate uniform convergence of each series of derivatives.

We now show that formula_21 is not analytic at any dyadic rational multiple of π, that is, at any formula_22 with formula_23 and formula_24. Since the sum of the first formula_25 terms is analytic, we need only consider formula_26, the sum of the terms with formula_27. For all orders of derivation formula_28 with formula_29, formula_30 and formula_31 we have

:formula_32

where we used the fact that formula_33 for all formula_34, and we bounded the first sum from below by the term with formula_35. As a consequence, at any such formula_17

:formula_37
so that the radius of convergence of the Taylor series of formula_38 at formula_39 is 0 by the Cauchy-Hadamard formula. Since the set of analyticity of a function is an open set, and since dyadic rationals are dense, we conclude that formula_38, and hence formula_41, is nowhere analytic in formula_42.

== Application to Taylor series ==
For every sequence α0, α1, α2, . . . of real or complex numbers, the following construction shows the existence of a smooth function &quot;F&quot; on the real line which has these numbers as derivatives at the origin. In particular, every sequence of numbers can appear as the coefficients of the Taylor series of a smooth function. This result is known as Borel&#x27;s lemma, after Émile Borel.

With the smooth transition function &quot;g&quot; as above, define

:formula_43

This function &quot;h&quot; is also smooth; it equals 1 on the closed interval [−1,1] and vanishes outside the open interval (−2,2). Using &quot;h&quot;, define for every natural number &quot;n&quot; (including zero) the smooth function

:formula_44

which agrees with the monomial &quot;xn&quot; on [−1,1] and vanishes outside the interval (−2,2). Hence, the &quot;k&quot;-th derivative of &quot;ψn&quot; at the origin satisfies

:formula_45

and the boundedness theorem implies that &quot;ψn&quot; and every derivative of &quot;ψn&quot; is bounded. Therefore, the constants

:formula_46

involving the supremum norm of &quot;ψn&quot; and its first &quot;n&quot; derivatives, are well-defined real numbers. Define the scaled functions

:formula_47

By repeated application of the chain rule,

:formula_48

and, using the previous result for the &quot;k&quot;-th derivative of &quot;ψn&quot; at zero,

:formula_49

It remains to show that the function

:formula_50

is well defined and can be differentiated term-by-term infinitely many times. To this end, observe that for every &quot;k&quot;

:formula_51

where the remaining infinite series converges by the ratio test.

== Application to higher dimensions ==

For every radius &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0,

:formula_52

with Euclidean norm ||&quot;x&quot;|| defines a smooth function on &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space with support in the ball of radius &quot;r&quot;, but formula_53.

==Complex analysis==
This pathology cannot occur with differentiable functions of a complex variable rather than of a real variable. Indeed, all holomorphic functions are analytic, so that the failure of the function &quot;f&quot; defined in this article to be analytic in spite of its being infinitely differentiable is an indication of one of the most dramatic differences between real-variable and complex-variable analysis.

Note that although the function &quot;f&quot; has derivatives of all orders over the real line, the analytic continuation of &quot;f&quot; from the positive half-line &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 to the complex plane, that is, the function

:formula_54

has an essential singularity at the origin, and hence is not even continuous, much less analytic. By the great Picard theorem, it attains every complex value (with the exception of zero) infinitely many times in every neighbourhood of the origin.

<doc id="421465" wikidata="Q506139" url="?curid=421465" title="Caryopsis">
<text>In botany, a caryopsis () is a type of simple fruit—one that is monocarpellate (formed from a single carpel) and indehiscent (not opening at maturity) and resembles an achene, except that in a caryopsis the pericarp is fused with the thin seed coat.

The caryopsis is popularly called a grain and is the fruit typical of the family Poaceae (or Gramineae), which includes wheat, rice, and maize.

The term &quot;grain&quot; is also used in a more general sense as synonymous with cereal (as in &quot;cereal grains&quot;, which include some non-Poaceae). Considering that the fruit wall and the seed are intimately fused into a single unit, and the caryopsis or grain is a dry fruit, little concern is given to technically separating the terms &quot;fruit&quot; and &quot;seed&quot; in these plant structures. In many grains, the &quot;hulls&quot; to be separated before processing are flower bracts.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;caryopsis&quot; is derived from the Greek words and ( and ), meaning &#x27;nut&#x27; and &#x27;having the appearance of&#x27;, respectively. The term was first used by Achille Richard to refer to the dry, monospermic, indehiscent fruit commonly found in grasses.

This definition of fruit for the Gramineae family has persisted to the modern day, but some botanists have challenged the idea that the dry caryopsis is a defining characteristic of the family. The other forms of fruit proposed to be borne by grasses include achenes, utricles, berries, and nuts. However, others have suggested that these differing fruit structures are representative of caryopsis diversity rather than of entirely different structures. This diverse form of the caryopsis would include the follicle-like form of &quot;Crypsis&quot; and &quot;Eleusine&quot; where a free pericarp adjoins the seeds which are extruded when moistened (as in an achene or utricle), the berry-like form found in some bamboo genera including &quot;Dinochloa&quot; and &quot;Olmeca&quot; where the pericarp is more thick and fleshy, and the nut-like form found in &quot;Dendrocalamus&quot; and &quot;Schizostachyum&quot;. By this definition, the caryopsis is truly the only fruit type found in the Gramineae. The types of caryopsis are often distinguished by the terms &quot;modified caryopsis&quot;, referring to caryopses with a pericarp not wholly adnate to the seed coat, and &quot;true caryopsis&quot;, referring to those with a pericarp totally adherent to the seed coat.

<text>Sheffield Winter Garden is a large temperate glasshouse located in the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. It is one of the largest temperate glasshouses to be built in the UK during the last hundred years, and the largest urban glasshouse anywhere in Europe. It is home to more than 2,000 plants from all around the world. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 22 May 2003.

==Design and construction==

Part of the £120 million Heart of the City regeneration project that has created the Peace Gardens and the £15 million Millennium Galleries, the Winter Garden was designed by Pringle Richards Sharratt Architects and Buro Happold and is some long and high.

The building has background frost protection to a minimum of 4 degrees Celsius and it is one of the largest Glued Laminated Timber or &quot;Glulam&quot; buildings in the UK (Glulam is made by forming and gluing strips of timber into specific shapes). The wood used is Larch, a durable timber which will, over time, turn a light silvery grey colour. The larch, derived from sustainable forests, requires no preservatives or coatings. This reduces the use of solvents and also avoids the use of chemicals that could harm the plants. 

The building has an intelligent Building Management System which controls fans and vents to make sure the plants are cooled in summer and kept warm in winter. The system will &quot;learn&quot; year by year.

The bedding plants are changed five times a year, to give a seasonal change, and all the plants are watered by hose or by watering can, as it is the only way to ensure that all the plants get the correct amount of water.

<doc id="421469" wikidata="Q1184733" url="?curid=421469" title="Fair Deal">
<text>The Fair Deal was a set of proposals put forward by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to Congress in 1945 and in his January 1949 State of the Union Address. More generally, the term characterizes the entire domestic agenda of the Truman administration, from 1945 to 1953. It offered new proposals to continue New Deal liberalism, but with a conservative coalition controlling Congress during most of Truman&#x27;s presidency, only a few of its major initiatives became law and then only if they had considerable Republican Party support. As Richard Neustadt concludes, the most important proposals were aid to education, national health insurance, the Fair Employment Practices Commission, and repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act. They were all debated at length, then voted down. Nevertheless, enough smaller and less controversial items passed that liberals could claim some success.

==Philosophy==
A liberal Democrat of the Midwestern populist tradition, Truman was determined to both continue the legacy of the New Deal and to make Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s proposed Economic Bill of Rights a reality, while making his own mark on social policy.

In a scholarly article published in 1972, historian Alonzo Hamby argued that the Fair Deal reflected the &quot;vital center&quot; approach to liberalism which rejected totalitarianism, was suspicious of excessive concentrations of government power, and honored the New Deal as an effort to achieve a &quot;democratic socialist society.&quot; Solidly based upon the New Deal tradition in its advocacy of wide-ranging social legislation, the Fair Deal differed enough to claim a separate identity. The Depression did not return after the war and the Fair Deal had to contend with prosperity and an optimistic future. The Fair Dealers thought in terms of abundance rather than depression scarcity. Economist Leon Keyserling argued that the liberal task was to spread the benefits of abundance throughout society by stimulating economic growth. Agriculture Secretary Charles F. Brannan wanted to unleash the benefits of agricultural abundance and to encourage the development of an urban-rural Democratic coalition. However, the Brannan Plan was defeated by strong conservative opposition in Congress and by his unrealistic confidence in the possibility uniting urban labor and farm owners who distrusted rural insurgency. The Korean War made military spending the nation&#x27;s priority and killed almost the entire Fair Deal, but did encourage the pursuit of economic growth. 

Following the midterm elections in 1948, the House acquired a liberal majority, but the Senate remained under conservative control. As one study noted at the time 

First of all, only one-third of the Senate is up for election every two years. In spite of the fact that the House has a narrow liberal majority, there are only 38 votes in the Senate wholeheartedly committed to the liberal program endorsed by the American voters last November.&quot;

Nevertheless, some of the Fair Deal&#x27;s progressive policies were enacted piecemeal by legislation during Truman&#x27;s time in office, and further enactments continued under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, culminating in the sweeping tide of progressive legislation under Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society agenda.

==1945 proposals==
In September 1945, Truman addressed Congress and presented a 21-point program of domestic legislation outlining a series of proposed actions in the fields of economic development and social welfare. The measures that Truman proposed to Congress included:

# Major improvements in the coverage and adequacy of the unemployment compensation system.
# Substantial increases in the minimum wage, together with broader coverage.
# The maintenance and extension of price controls to keep down the cost of living in the transition to a peacetime economy.
# A pragmatic approach towards drafting legislation eliminating wartime agencies and wartime controls, taking legal difficulties into account.
# Legislation to ensure full employment.
# Legislation to make the Fair Employment Practice Committee permanent.
# The maintenance of relations with both industry and unions.
# The extension of the United States Employment Service to provide jobs for demobilized military personnel.
# Increased aid to farmers.
# The removal of the restrictions on eligibility for voluntary enlistment and allowing the armed forces to enlist a greater number of volunteers.
# The enactment of broad and comprehensive housing legislation.
# The establishment of a single Federal research agency.
# A major revision of the taxation system.
# The encouragement of surplus-property disposal.
# Greater levels of assistance to small businesses.
# Improvements in federal aid to war veterans.
# A major expansion of public works, conserving and building up natural resources.
# The encouragement of post-war reconstruction and settling the obligations of the Lend-Lease Act.
# The introduction of a decent pay scale for all Federal Government employees—executive, legislative, and judicial.
# The promotion of the sale of ships to remove the uncertainty regarding the disposal of America&#x27;s large surplus tonnage following the end of hostilities.
# Legislation to bring about the acquisition and retention of stockpiles of materials necessary for meeting the defense needs of the nation.

Finally, Truman announced that he would soon &quot;communicate with the Congress recommending a national health program to provide adequate medical care for all Americans and to protect them from financial loss and hardships resulting from illness and accident.&quot; (See the Healthcare section below.)

Truman did not send proposed legislation to Congress; he expected Congress to draft the bills. Many of these proposed reforms, however, were never realized due to the opposition of the conservative majority in Congress, further solidified after the Republicans took control of both houses in the 1946 midterm elections. Despite these setbacks, Truman&#x27;s proposals to Congress became more and more abundant over the course of his presidency, and by 1948 a legislative program that was more comprehensive came to be known as the &quot;Fair Deal&quot;.

==1949 proposals==
In his 1949 State of the Union address to Congress on January 5, 1949, Truman stated that &quot;Every segment of our population, and every individual, has a right to expect from his government a fair deal.&quot; The proposed measures included:

* federal aid to education, 
* a large tax cut for low-income earners 
* the abolition of poll taxes
* an anti-lynching law
* a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission
* a farm aid program
* increased public housing
* an immigration bill
* new TVA-style public works projects
* the establishment of a new Department of Welfare
* the repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act, regulating the activities of labor unions
* an increase in the minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents an hour
* national health insurance
* expanded Social Security coverage, and 
* a $4 billion tax increase to reduce the national debt and finance these programs.

Despite a mixed record of legislative success, the Fair Deal remains significant in establishing the call for universal health care as a rallying cry for the Democratic Party. Lyndon B. Johnson credited Truman&#x27;s unfulfilled program as influencing Great Society measures such as Medicare that Johnson successfully pushed through Congress during the 1960s.

==Opposition and progress==
The Fair Deal reforms helped to transform the United States from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. In the context of postwar reconstruction and the Cold War, the Fair Deal sought to preserve and extend the liberal tradition of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. However, the Fair Deal faced much opposition from the many conservative politicians who wanted a reduced role of the federal government. During these postwar years, the nation enjoyed a return to prosperity not seen since before the Great Depression, and support for conservative politicians grew.

The Fair Deal faced opposition by a coalition of conservative Republicans and predominantly southern conservative Democrats. However, despite strong opposition, there were elements of Truman&#x27;s agenda that did win congressional approval, such as the public housing subsidies cosponsored by Republican Robert A. Taft under the 1949 National Housing Act, which funded slum clearance and the construction of 810,000 units of low-income housing over a period of six years.

Truman was also helped by the election of a Democratic Congress in 1948. According to Eric Leif Davin, the 1949–50 Congress &#x27;was the most liberal Congress since 1938 and produced more &quot;New-Deal-Fair Deal&quot; legislation than any Congress between 1938 and Johnson&#x27;s Great Society of the mid-1960s.&quot; As noted by one study

This was the Congress that reformed the Displaced Persons Act, increased the minimum wage, doubled the hospital construction program, authorized the National Science Foundation and the rural telephone program, suspended the &#x27;sliding scale&#x27; on price supports, extended the soil conservation program, provided new grants for planning state and local public works and plugged the long-standing merger loophole in the Clayton Act...Moreover, as protector, as defender, wielder of the veto against encroachments on the liberal preserve, Truman left a record of considerable success – an aspect of the Fair Deal not to be discounted.

Although Truman was unable to implement his Fair Deal program in its entirety, a great deal of social and economic progress took place in the late forties and early fifties. A census report confirmed that gains in housing, education, living standards, and income under the Truman administration were unparalleled in American history. The minimum wage had also been increased while Social Security benefits had been doubled, and eight million veterans had attended college by the end of the Truman administration as a result of the G.I. Bill, which subsidized the businesses, training, education, and housing of millions of returning veterans.

Millions of homes had been financed through previous government programs, and a start was made in slum clearance. Poverty was also significantly reduced, with one estimate suggesting that the percentage of Americans living in poverty had fallen from 33% of the population in 1949 to 28% by 1952. Incomes had risen faster than prices, which meant that real living standards were considerably higher than seven years earlier. Progress had also been made in civil rights, with the desegregation of both the federal civil Service and the armed forces and the creation of the Commission on Civil Rights. In fact, according to one historian, Truman had &quot;done more than any President since Lincoln to awaken American conscience to the issues of civil rights&quot;.

==Legislation and programs==
Note: This listing contains reforms drawn up by the Truman Administration together with reforms drawn up by individual Congressmen. The latter have been included because it is arguable that the progressive nature of these reforms (such as the Water Pollution Law, which was partly a Republican initiative) was compatible with the liberalism of the Fair Deal.

===Civil rights===
As Senator, Truman had not supported the nascent Civil Rights Movement. In a 1947 speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which marked the first time a sitting president had ever addressed the group, Truman said &quot;Every man should have the right to a decent home, the right to an education, the right to adequate medical care, the right to a worthwhile job, the right to an equal share in the making of public decisions through the ballot, and the right to a fair trial in a fair court.&quot;

As President, he put forward many civil rights programs but they were met with a lot of resistance by southern Democrats. All his legislative proposals were blocked. However, he used presidential executive orders to end discrimination in the armed forces and denied government contracts to firms with racially discriminatory practices. He also named African Americans to federal posts. Except for nondiscrimination provisions of the Housing Act of 1949, Truman had to be content with civil rights&#x27; gains achieved by executive order or through the federal courts. Vaughan argues that by continuing appeals to Congress for civil rights legislation, Truman helped reverse the long acceptance of segregation and discrimination by establishing integration as a moral principle.

===Healthcare===
On November 19, 1945, Truman sent a Special Message to Congress recommending the adoption and funding of &quot;a comprehensive and modern health program for the Nation, consisting of five major parts&quot;:

* Construction of hospitals and related facilities
* Expansion of public health, maternal, and child care services
* Medical education and research
* Prepayment of medical costs through a compulsory national health insurance program, covering medical, hospital, nursing, and laboratory services
* Protection against loss of wages through sickness and disability through a national disability insurance program

On the same day, New York Senator Robert F. Wagner introduced S. 1606, known as the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill, containing legislative provisions to enact Truman&#x27;s national health program into law. After intense debates in Congress, the bill failed to pass.

However, a number of other public-health initiatives were enacted during Truman&#x27;s presidency:

* A bill was signed which authorized federal agencies to provide minor medical and dental services to employees (1945).
* The National Mental Health Act (1946) authorized federal support for mental health research and treatment programs.
* The Water Pollution Law (1948) provided funds for sewage treatment system and pollution research while empowering the Justice Department to file suit against polluters.
* The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (1947) introduced regulations on the use of pesticide in food production.
* The Hill-Burton Act (Hospital Survey and Construction Act) (1946) established a federal program of financial assistance for the modernization and construction of hospital facilities. The program brought national standards and financing to local hospitals, and raised standards of medical care throughout the United States during the course of the 1950s and 1960s. While the legislation favored middle-class communities because it required local financial contributions, it channeled federal funds to poor communities, thus raising hospital standards and equity in access to quality care. The program required hospitals assisted by federal funding to provide emergency treatment to the uninsured and a reasonable volume of free or reduced cost care to poor Americans.
* The Hospital Survey and Construction Amendments of 1949 raised the amount of federal funding available and raised the federal share of hospital construction to two-thirds. These amendments made it possible for less-wealthy communities to benefit from the Hill-Burton Act of 1946.
* A program was established to fund payments to medical vendors for care of aged persons on low incomes (1950).
* Funding was authorized for research and demonstration relating to the coordination, utilization, and development of hospital services.
* Grants to states for cancer control were introduced (1947).
* The Omnibus Medical Research Act (1950) authorized the establishment of the Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness and the transmutation of the Experimental Biology and medical Institute into the much larger Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. The legislation also empowered the Surgeon General to establish additional institutes when he felt that they were necessary, and also to &#x27;conduct and support research and research training relating to other diseases and groups of diseases.&#x27;
* The Atomic Energy Commission was directed by Congress to investigate the application of atomic research to cancer therapies, providing some $5 million for this purpose (1950).
* A Clinical and Laboratory Research Center was established (1947).
* The research construction provisions of the Appropriations Act for FY 1948 provided funds &quot;for the acquisition of a site, and the preparation of plans, specifications, and drawings, for additional research buildings and a 600-bed clinical research hospital and necessary accessory buildings related thereto to be used in general medical research ...&quot;
* The National Heart Act (1948) authorized the National Heart Institute to assist, conduct, and foster research, provide training, and to provide help to the states in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of heart disease.
* The National Institute of Dental Research was authorized by the National Dental Research Act (1948) to &quot;conduct, assist, and foster dental research; provide training; and cooperate with the states in the prevention and control of dental diseases.&quot;
* A National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases was established (1950).
* A National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness was established (1950).
* The Durham-Humphrey Amendment (1951) defined &quot;the kinds of drugs that cannot be safely used without medical supervision and restricts their sale to prescription by a licensed practitioner.&quot;

===Welfare===
Under Truman, many adjustments were made to the social welfare system, although one of his key aims, to extend Social Security coverage to 25 million Americans, was never accomplished. Despite this, 10 million received Social Security coverage.

* The Federal Railroad Disability Insurance program was enacted (1946).
* The Social Security Act was amended (1950) to provide a new category of state aid to the totally and permanently disabled.
* Throughout 1950, more than thirty major changes were made to Social Security. Compulsory coverage was extended to residents of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, federal employees not covered by federal pensions, domestic servants, most self-employed workers, and agricultural workers. State and local government workers were provided with the option of joining the system. Survivor&#x27;s benefits were increased and expanded, and Social Security benefits were increased significantly for current beneficiaries by 77.5%. Changes were also made to increase the progressivity of benefits. Another amendment granted wage credits toward all Social Security benefits for military service performed between September 1940 and July 1947.
* The Aid to Families with Dependent Children program was expanded to include support for caregivers (1950).
* Grants to states for public assistance to needy individuals, those who were totally and permanently disabled, and also to maternal and child welfare services, were broadened and increased.
* The Displaced Persons Act admitted individuals who were victims of persecution by the Nazi government.
* The admissions numbers for displaced persons were doubled to 400,000 (1950).
* Federal financial participation of public assistance payments was increased (1946).
* Compulsory contribution to Social Security was expanded (in principle) to all dependent employees and workers (1946).
* The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) was amended in 1946 to permit states where employees made contributions under the unemployment insurance program to use some or all of these contributions for the payment of disability benefits.
* The Social Security Act was amended in 1946 to provide survivor benefits to the dependents of World War II veterans who died within three years of having been discharged from the military. The amendments considered veterans of the Second World War to be fully insured under Social Security for purposes of survivor benefits, even if they had not completed the required number of quarters of covered employment under Social Security.
* The Civil Service Retirement Act was amended (1948) to provide protection for the survivors of Federal employees.
* The Civil Service Retirement Act of 1930 was amended (1945) to provide retirement credit, in computing length of service, to persons who left Government service to enter the armed forces.
* The Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act were amended (1945) in order to extend coverage to all employees of the Bonneville Power Administration who were not covered under the Federal Civil Service Retirement Act and therefore had no retirement protection.
* The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and Railroad Retirement Act amendments (1946) established monthly survivor benefits and sickness and maternity benefits for railroad employees. The Social Security Act was also amended by the provision making wages in railroad employment applicable for survivor benefits under the old-age and survivors insurance program.
* The Social Security Act was amended (1946) to provide coverage to private maritime employees under State unemployment insurance, monthly benefits under old age and survivors insurance for survivors of certain World War II veterans, and temporary unemployment benefits to seamen with wartime Federal employment. Permission was given to States, with employee contributions under their unemployment insurance laws, to use such funds for temporary disability insurance benefits. There would also be greater Federal sharing in public assistance payments for a specified period, and larger grants were to be provided for maternal and child health and child welfare, as well as the extension of these programs to the Virgin Islands.
* A bill was approved (1947) which extended to July 1949 the time in which income from nursing service and agricultural labor could be disregarded in making old age assistance payments.
* A law as passed (1947) under which certain aged recipients of assistance could continue, until July 1949, to care for the sick or work for wages on a farm without having such wages jeopardize their assistance payment.
* The Railroad Retirement Act was amended (1948) to increase certain survivor and retirement benefits.
* A law was passed (1948) which raised railroad pensions by 20%, yet reduced taxes on payrolls.
* A law was passed (1948) which increased certain benefits payable under the Longshoremen&#x27;s and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.
* A law was approved (1949) which authorized appropriations for the Federal Security Administrator to meet the emergency needs of crippled children for fiscal year 1949, in addition to funds authorized under the Social Security Act.
* Increases in Social Security benefits were authorized (1948).
* An act for the rehabilitation of the Navajo and Hopi tribes of Indians was approved (1950), which included a provision to increase the Federal participation in public assistance payments.
* The Social Security Act of 1950 increased welfare benefits, extended the coverage of Social Security to elderly Americans, and raised the minimum wage. These benefits appealed to both middle-class and working-class Americans. Farm and domestic employees and nonfarm self-employed persons came to be covered for first time under the Social Security Old-Age Insurance pension program. As a result of these changes, an additional 10.5 million Americans were covered by Social Security. According to one historian the 1950 act &quot;was almost as significant as the original 1935 legislation.&quot;
* In September 1950, benefits began to be paid to dependent husbands, dependent widowers, wives under the age of sixty-five with children in their care, and divorced wives.
* A law was signed (1952) which increased sickness and unemployment benefits for railroad workers by 30% to 60%, and was financed by a payroll levy on the railroads.
* The Social Security Act was amended (1952) to extend for another year &quot;the time within which State Governments could make agreements that were retroactive to January 1, 1951, for old-age and survivors insurance coverage of State and local Government employees&quot;.
* The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (1949) provided the Federal Security Administrator with the authority to dispose of surplus Federal property to nonprofit or tax-supported educational institutions for health or educational purposes.
* The Social Security Act of 1952 increased benefits under the old-age and survivors insurance program, extended the period of wage credits for military service through December 31, 1953, liberalized the retirement test and raised the retirement test from $50 to $75 a month. The legislation also changed, for a two-year period, the grant formula for public assistance payments in order to make additional funds available to the States.
* Social Security coverage was extended to farm workers (1951).
* Unemployment coverage was extended.
* A bill was passed (1952) which raised Social Security benefits by 12.5%.

A centerpiece of the Fair Deal—the repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act—failed to pass. As Plotke notes, &quot;By the early 1950s repeal of Taft–Hartley was only a symbolic Democratic platform statement.&quot;

* A new Fair Labor Standards Act established a 75-cent-an-hour minimum wage.
* The Employment Act of 1946 created a clear legal obligation on the part of the federal government to use all practical means &#x27;to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.&#x27; The Act also established &quot;the basic core of machinery for such economic planning – the Council of Economic Advisers working directly for the President, and the joint Committee on the Economic report in Congress.&quot; Under the Employment Act, within two decades following its passage, swift measures taken by the Federal Reserve authorities and by the administration in charge held in check four recessions, those of 1948–49, 1953–54, 1957–58, and 1960–61.
* The Office of Economic Stabilization was re-established (1946) in an effort to control rising prices.
* The Federal Employees Pay Act (1946) brought about a 14% increase in the base pay of most Government workers whose positions were subjected to the Classification Act of 1923.
* The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949 introduced various provisions designed to &quot;assure the health, efficiency and general well-being of workers.&quot;
* The Federal Employees&#x27; Compensation Act Amendments of 1949 broadened the coverage of the act while increasing benefits.
* The Wagner-Peyser Act was extended to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
* Moderate tax relief for low-income earners was passed by Congress.
* The first code of federal regulations for mine safety was authorized by Congress (1947).
* The Federal Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952 provided for annual inspections in certain underground coal mines, and provided the Bureau with limited enforcement authority, including the power to issue violation notices and imminent danger withdrawal orders. The Act also authorized the assessment of civil penalties against mine operators for refusing to give inspectors access to mine property or for noncompliance with withdrawal orders, although no provision was made for monetary penalties for noncompliance with the safety provisions.
* Child labor was finally prohibited through an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act(1949).
* The number of employees covered by the federal minimum wage was increased.
* The Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Act of 1948 prohibited employers from intimidating, discharging, threatening to discharge, or coercing permanent employees for serving jury duty.
* A previous Railway Labour Act was amended by a law effective January the 10th 1951, &quot;to permit carriers and employees covered by the act to bargain collectively for a union shop and check-off of union dues.&quot;
* A law of January the 10th 1951, as noted by one study, &quot;authorized deductions pursuant to the written consent of seamen, to be held in trust for the establishment of benefits for the sole use of seamen or their families for the purpose of providing medical and hospital care, retirement or survivors&#x27; pensions, life insurance, unemployment benefits, and sickness or disability benefits.&quot;
* The McGuire Act (1952) strengthened fair trade laws by enabling manufacturers to extend price maintenance even to retailers &quot;who refused to sign contracts.&quot;

===Education===
As Donaldson notes, the major proposal for large-scale federal aid to education &quot;died quickly, mostly over whether aid should be given to private schools.&quot;

* The National School Lunch and Milk Act (1946) established school lunch programs across the United States, with the purpose of safeguarding &quot;the health and well-being of the nation&#x27;s children and to encourage the consumption of agricultural abundance&quot;. This legislation introduced the provision of commodity donations and federal grants for non-profit milk and lunches in private and public schools. The program had the strong support of conservative Congressmen from rural districts.
* The George-Barden Act (1946) expanded federal support for vocational education.
* The Fulbright Program was established (1946), becoming one of the &quot;world&#x27;s largest and most respected cooperative educational programs for the interchange of graduate students, teachers, and scholars.&quot;
* The National Science Foundation was established to support education and research in science.
* The School Construction Act (Public Law 815) authorized a 3-year program &quot;calling for the construction of critically needed school facilities in those school districts overburdened by Federal activities.&quot;
* The Federal Impacted Areas Aid Program (1950) authorized federal aid to school districts in which &quot;large numbers of federal employees and tax-exempt federal property create either a substantial increase in public school enrollments or a significant reduction in local property tax revenues.&quot;
* Long-term low-interest loans to colleges for dormitory construction were authorized (1950).
* Following the outbreak of the Korean War aid was provided for current expenses and for the construction of additional school facilities in districts which had become centers of wartime activity and were overwhelmed by the arrival of military personnel and their families.
* $96.5 million was appropriated for school construction under P.L. 81-815 (1950).
* The federal government funded scholarships and loans for nursing students and provided aid to medical schools in order to meet the growing need for caregivers.
* $23 million was appropriated for school operating expenses under P.L. 81-874 (1950).

===Housing===
During the Truman years, the role of the federal government in the field of housing provision was extended, with one major reform in particular (the Housing Act of 1949) passed with the support of the conservative senator Robert A. Taft.

* The Housing Act of 1949 was a major legislative accomplishment stemming from the collaboration of the Fair Deal supporters with conservative leader Senator Taft. This led to the allocation of federal funds to go towards 800,000 units of public housing.
* The Federal Housing and Rent Act (1947) was passed to encourage the construction of new rental housing in cities.
* In July 1947, the 1937 Housing Act was amended to prohibit (as noted by one study) “eviction of over-income tenants from low-rent public housing if the eviction would result in undue hardship.” 
* The Housing and Rent Act (1949) extended federal rent control authority.
* The Farmers Home Administration was established (1946) to assist self-help rural housing groups as well as to make grants and loans for the repair and construction of rural homes.
* More money was provided for farm housing.
* The Federal Housing Administration&#x27;s mortgage insurance programs were liberalized, authorizing a program of limited technical research and setting up a new program for guaranteeing a minimum yield on direct investments in housing.
* The Housing Act of 1950 enlarged and liberalized the loan guarantee privileges of Second World War veterans by administering a direct loan program for those veterans who were unable to acquire private home financing. The legislation also authorized a program of mortgage insurance for co-operative housing projects, a program of technical aid, and a new program of mortgage insurance for low-priced new rural housing.
* The Housing and Home Finance Agency was established (1947), promising co-ordination of the principal nonfarm housing functions of the federal government.
* Rent controls were extended (1951) to cover previously exempted categories.
* Funds were provided for slum clearance and urban renewal.
* Appropriations for the Farmer&#x27;s Home Administration were increased (1950).

===Veterans===
Veterans benefits were non-controversial, and won support from left and right.

* The Veterans&#x27; regulations were amended (1945) to provide increased rates of pension for certain service-incurred disabilities, generally on a parity with rates payable for similar disabilities under the World War I Veterans&#x27; Act, 1924, as amended.
* The Veteran&#x27;s Readjustment Assistance Act (1952) included provisions for unemployment compensation for veterans under a uniform Federal formula.
* Legislation was approved (1952) which increased veteran&#x27;s compensation and pension rates.
* A law was signed (1949), which extended for one year to June 1950 reconversion and unemployment benefits for seamen provided by Title XIII of the Social Security Act.
* $3.7 billion was spent of GI benefits from 1945 to 1949.
* The Social Security Act was amended (1952) to grant wage credits toward Social Security benefits for each month of military service after July 1947 and before January 1954.
* Laws were enacting permitting the payment to veterans of retroactive benefits during hospitalization, while a time extension was enacted for filling in certain cases claiming benefit and compensation.

===Agriculture===
Dean shows that the major Fair Deal initiative, the &quot;Brannan Plan&quot; proposed by Secretary of Agriculture Brannan, failed in Congress because Truman delayed too long in presenting it before Congress and it lost initiative and because he never consulted with top leaders in farm legislation. A separate Anderson Act was signed in 1949 that had more in common with the Republican-sponsored Agricultural Act of 1948 than Secretary Brannan&#x27;s plan did.

* A Conservation of Wildlife Act was passed (1946) to protect wildlife resources.
* The Farmers Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (1948) stabilized, supported and protected farm incomes and prices, assisted in maintaining adequate supplies, and facilitated an orderly distribution of commodities.
* The Agricultural Act (1948) introduced a more flexible system of price supports.
* The Agricultural Act (1949) maintained price supports at 90% of parity. The Act also made certain donated commodities acquired through price-support operations by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) available for distribution to local public welfare organizations serving poor Americans, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and school lunch programs. It also authorized the CCC &quot;to pay for added processing, packaging, and handling costs for foods acquired under price support so that recipient outlets could more fully use them&quot;.
* The Disaster Loan Act (1949) made farmers who experienced severe crop losses due to natural disasters eligible for special low-interest loans.
* A loan program was authorized (1949) for expanding and improving rural telephone facilities.
* The REA and soil-conservation programs were expanded.

===Federal reclamation and power projects===
Truman&#x27;s Fair Deal reclamation program called for expanded public distribution of federally produced electric power and endorsed restrictions on the amount of land an owner could irrigate from federal water projects. Lobbying efforts by privately owned power companies prevented the spread of public utilities. Political pressure and conflicts with the Budget Bureau and the Army Corps of Engineers kept the Bureau of Reclamation from enforcing the excess land law.

* Rural electrification and public power were extended.
* New conservation projects were initiated.
* Funds for the Tennessee Valley Authority were significantly increased.
* Funds were provided for western land reclamation.
* Funds were provided for hydroelectric power stations.
* Flood control developments were expanded.
* Some money was spent on public works.
* Appropriations for the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Rural Electrification Administration were increased (1950).
* Funding for the Reclamation Bureau&#x27;s hydroelectric, water control, and irrigation projects in the west was increased.

<text>William Vaughn, popularly known as Billy Vaughn (born Richard Smith Vaughn, April 12, 1919 – September 26, 1991) was an American musician, singer, multi-instrumentalist, orchestra leader, and A&amp;R man for Dot Records.

==Biography==
Vaughn was born in Glasgow, Kentucky, United States, where his father, Alvis Radford Vaughn, was a barber who loved music and inspired Vaughn to teach himself to play the mandolin at the age of three, while suffering from measles. He went on to learn a number of other instruments, including guitar and alto saxophone, his primary instruments.

In 1941, Vaughn joined the United States National Guard for what had been planned as a one-year assignment, but when World War II broke out, he was in for the duration as a valued musician and composer at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. Major General Daniel I. Sultan decided that Vaughn was too valuable to the base&#x27;s Thirty-Eighth Division big band, and kept him at Camp Shelby for the duration of the war. He decided to make music a career when he was discharged from the army at the end of the war, and on the GI Bill, attended Western Kentucky State College, now known as Western Kentucky University, majoring in music composition. He had apparently learned to barber from his father, because he did some while studying at Western Kentucky to support himself financially, when he was not able to get jobs playing the piano at local night clubs and lounges. While he was a student there, three other students, Jimmy Sacca, Donald McGuire, and Seymour Spiegelman, who had formed a vocal trio, the Hilltoppers, recruited Vaughn to play the piano with them. He soon added his voice to theirs, converting the trio to a quartet. As a member of the group, he also wrote their first hit song, &quot;Trying&quot;, which charted in 1952.

In 1954, he left the group to join Dot Records in Gallatin, Tennessee, as music director. He subsequently formed his own orchestra which had a hit single in that same year with &quot;Melody of Love.&quot; It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He went on to have many more hits over the next decade and a half and was the most commercially successful orchestra leader of the rock era.

Vaughn charted a total of 42 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, often based on the sound of two alto saxophones and guitar as his &#x27;trademark&#x27;. Vaughn was the bandleader, and he played the lead guitar on most of his songs. He also charted thirty six albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, beginning with 1958&#x27;s &quot;Sail Along Silv&#x27;ry Moon&quot; and ending with 1970&#x27;s &quot;Winter World of Love&quot;. He also had nineteen Top 40 hits in (Germany), beginning with the chart-topping &quot;Sail Along, Silv&#x27;ry Moon&quot;, also a gold record, which was a cover of a 1937 Bing Crosby hit. He had two more number ones in Germany: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Wheels&quot; (all three were reportedly million sellers). Vaughn&#x27;s recording of &quot;Wheels&quot; was no. 1 for 14 weeks in Germany (Hit Bilanz) as well as no. 1 in India, New Zealand, and Italy. Vaughn also charted in Australia, Latin America, and Japan. &quot;Pearly Shells&quot; was a major success in Japan. Vaughn&#x27;s tours of that country began about the time &quot;Pearly Shells&quot; was a hit in 1965. Many songs which were not US hits or even singles releases there were major hits in other countries. These included &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;, &quot;Zwei Gitarren am Meer&quot;, &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; (Germany), and &quot;Greenfields&quot;. Also successful were &quot;Song of Peace&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Lonesome Old Town&quot; (Japan), &quot;Michelle&quot; (no 1 in Argentina and Malaysia), &quot;Mexico&quot; (no. 1 in the Philippines), and &quot;Bonanza&quot; (a major success in Brazil and Italy) plus &quot;Theme from the Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (various Latin American countries). The album &quot;La Paloma&quot; was a success throughout Latin America. He also had a number one album in Germany in the early 1980s with &quot;Moonlight Melodies&quot;, which consisted of 20 of Billy&#x27;s biggest hits (original Dot recordings, original LP notes and credits). In addition, Dot Records released a compilation recording of tangos, rumbas and easy listening music featuring both the Billy Vaughn Orchestra and the John Serry Orchestra in Japan.

<doc id="421473" wikidata="Q605697" url="?curid=421473" title="The Mists of Avalon">
<text>The Mists of Avalon is a 1983 historical fantasy novel by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley, in which the author relates the Arthurian legends from the perspective of the female characters. The book follows the trajectory of Morgaine (Morgan le Fay), a priestess fighting to save her Celtic religion in a country where Christianity threatens to destroy the pagan way of life. The epic is focused on the lives of Morgaine, Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere), Viviane, Morgause, Igraine and other women of the Arthurian legend.

&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is in stark contrast to most other retellings of the Arthurian tales, which consistently cast Morgan le Fay as a distant, one-dimensional evil sorceress, with little or no explanation given for her antagonism to the Round Table. In this case, Morgaine is presented as a woman with unique gifts and responsibilities at a time of enormous political and spiritual upheaval who is called upon to defend her indigenous heritage against impossible odds.

The story is told in four large parts: &quot;Book One: Mistress of Magic&quot;, &quot;Book Two: The High Queen&quot;, &quot;Book Three: The King Stag&quot;, and &quot;Book Four: The Prisoner in the Oak&quot;. The novel was a best-seller upon its publication and remains popular to this day. Bradley and Diana L. Paxson later expanded the book into the &quot;Avalon&quot; series.

==Plot==
Morgaine, priestess of Avalon, is King Arthur&#x27;s half-sister. Their mother, Igraine, married king Uther Pendragon after Morgaine&#x27;s father, Gorlois, died in battle. Rumors spread in Avalon that, before Igraine knew of Gorlois&#x27;s death, Uther consulted with Merlin, who used magic to give Uther Gorlois&#x27;s appearance and, thus, gain access to Igraine at Tintagel. He had sex with her and they conceived Arthur. Morgaine witnesses Uther&#x27;s accession to Caerleon&#x27;s throne after his predecessor, Ambrosius, dies of old age. Uther becomes her step-father, and he and Igraine have Arthur.

When Morgaine is eleven years old and Arthur six, there is an attempt to murder Arthur. Their maternal aunt, the high priestess Viviane, arrives in Caerleon and advises Uther to have Arthur fostered far away from the court for his own safety. Uther agrees, and allows Viviane to take Morgaine to Avalon, where she is trained as a priestess of the Mother Goddess. During this period, Morgaine becomes aware of the rising tension between the old Pagan and the new Christian religions. After seven years of training, Morgaine is initiated as a priestess of the Mother, and Viviane begins grooming her as the next Lady of Avalon.

Months after her initiation, Morgaine is given in a fertility rite to the future high king of Britain. Their union is not meant to be personal, but rather a symbolic wedding between him and the land he is to defend. They have sex, and the following morning, they talk and each reveal themselves as Morgaine and Arthur. After recognizing each other, they are horrified to realize what they have done. Two months later, Morgaine is devastated to find that she is pregnant.

After Uther dies fighting the Saxon invaders, Arthur claims the throne of Britain despite questions about his legitimacy (he was conceived within days of Igraine&#x27;s marriage to Uther). Since Arthur must now defend Britain against the Saxons, Viviane has Morgaine make him an enchanted scabbard that will prevent him from losing blood and gives him the sacred sword Excalibur. With the combined force of Avalon and Caerleon, Arthur repels the invaders and marries Gwenhwyfar.

As Morgaine&#x27;s unborn child grows within her, so do her feelings of anger and betrayal toward Viviane, who she believes tricked her into bearing a child to Arthur. Unable to stay in Avalon any longer, she leaves for the court of her aunt Morgause, queen of Lothian, where she gives birth to her son, naming him Gwydion. Spurred by her husband Lot&#x27;s ambition and her own, Morgause tricks Morgaine into allowing her to rear her son. To escape Lot&#x27;s unwanted advances, Morgaine leaves Lothian and returns to Arthur&#x27;s court as a lady-in-waiting to his queen, Gwenhwyfar. She does not see Gwydion again until he is grown and a Druid priest.

When Gwenhwyfar fails to produce an heir, she is convinced that God is punishing her for her sins. She considers her greatest sins to be her failure to persuade Arthur to outlaw pagan religious practice in Britain and her forbidden love for Galahad, Arthur&#x27;s cousin and finest knight, also known as Lancelet. Although Lancelet reciprocates Gwenhwyfar&#x27;s love, he is also Arthur&#x27;s friend and an honorable man. This situation causes suffering to both Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar. Meanwhile, Morgaine also falls in love with Lancelet.

On the eve of a decisive battle against the Saxons, Gwenhwyfar prevails upon Arthur to put aside Uther&#x27;s Pendragon banner and replace it with her own Christian banner. As her religious fanaticism grows, relations between Avalon and Caerleon grow strained. Still, in her desperation over her failure to carry a child to term, she asks Morgaine for help, threatening to have an extramarital affair so she can become pregnant. In an attempt to keep Gwenhwyfar from doing so, Morgaine reveals to Gwenhwyfar that Arthur already has a son, though he does not know it. Later, Arthur asks Lancelet to join him and his wife in his bed to conceive a child, stating that the child would be conceived on his bed, and to satisfy the suffering of both Gwenhwyfar and Lancelet. Lancelet at first refuses, but is finally convinced; however, no child is conceived even from this.

After the battle, Arthur moves his court to Camelot, which is more easily defended than Caerleon was. Seeking to free both Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar from the forbidden love that traps them both, Morgaine tricks Lancelet into marrying Gwenhwyfar&#x27;s cousin, Elaine. Later, during a dispute with Arthur over their lack of an heir, Gwenhwyfar breaks Morgaine&#x27;s confidence and tells Arthur of Gwydion. Arthur summons Morgaine and orders her to tell the truth, and she obeys. Now believing that the lack of a royal heir is God&#x27;s punishment for Arthur&#x27;s union, however unwitting, with Morgaine, Gwenhwyfar urges Arthur to confess the encounter to the bishop, who imposes strict penance upon him. Then she and Arthur arrange for Morgaine to marry into Wales, far from Camelot. But because of a misunderstanding, Morgaine, who thought she would be marrying the king&#x27;s younger son Accolon, a Druid priest and warrior, finds herself betrothed to King Uriens of North Wales, who is old enough to be her grandfather. Arthur yearns to meet Gwydion and perhaps foster him at Camelot, but each time he brings up the subject with Gwenhwyfar, she refuses to discuss it. Meanwhile, Gwydion is taken by Viviane to Avalon.

Morgaine marries Uriens and moves to North Wales as its queen, and enjoys a good friendship with him, and his youngest son, Uwaine, whom she starts considering as her own son. Years later, she begins an affair with Accolon. The &quot;old people&quot; of the hills, who keep to the old pagan ways, regard Accolon and Morgaine as their king and queen. Uriens suspects nothing, but Accolon&#x27;s older brother, Avalloch, begins to; he eventually tries to blackmail Morgaine into sleeping with him as well. Morgaine sends Avalloch out on a boar hunt and magically has him killed by the boar. In his grief for his eldest son and heir, Uriens abstains from pork for the rest of his life.

Gwydion, now grown, goes to the Saxon courts to learn warfare far from Arthur&#x27;s eye. Impressed by his cleverness, the Saxons name him Mordred (&quot;Evil Counsel&quot;). Years later, at a Pentecost feast at Camelot, he introduces himself as Queen Morgaine&#x27;s son and Queen Morgause&#x27;s foster son, though he calls Queen Morgause &quot;Mother&quot; and Morgaine by her name. Because of his resemblance to Lancelet, he must often tell people that Lancelet is not his father. To earn his knighthood with no suspicion of preferential treatment, Gwydion challenges Lancelet to single combat during a tourney and they fight. Gwenhwyfar, who warmed to Gwydion in the meantime, protests and Arthur interrupts the match. Lancelet makes Gwydion a knight of the Round Table, naming him Mordred.

Morgaine tells Accolon, who is now Uriens&#x27;s heir, of the sacred marriage she made with Arthur years before. She adds that they must take the kingdom back from Arthur and the Christians and bring it back under the sway of Avalon. Meanwhile, Morgaine gets pregnant and is not sure if the child is Uriens&#x27; or Accolon&#x27;s, but has an abortion because she is too old to give birth safely. The attempted coup fails and Arthur kills Accolon in single combat, sending a warning to Morgaine. As Uriens recovers from the shock of losing a second son and his wife&#x27;s betrayal, Morgaine leaves Wales forever and returns to Avalon.

Morgaine returns to Camelot years later, disguised, with another sister of Avalon, during the Pentecost festival. At the start of the holy rites, the Sacred Regalia of Avalon, the sword, the spear, the dish, and the cup, are presented to the church as an offering, having been stolen from Avalon. Enraged and wielding great magic, Morgaine invokes the Great Mother Goddess to retrieve them. The assembled court sees the manifestation of the Grail as a holy revelation and Morgaine as the Virgin Mary. When the knights of the Round Table leave to search for the Holy Grail, Mordred attempts to usurp the throne. The armies of Arthur and Mordred eventually fight but in the end, Mordred dies and Arthur is mortally wounded. Morgaine takes the dying Arthur through the mists to Avalon, reassuring him that he did not fail in his attempt to save Britain from the approaching dark times. Arthur dies as the shoreline comes into view. Morgaine buries him in Avalon and remains there to tell the tale of Camelot.

==Characters==
* Morgaine — Narrator, protagonist. Her character is capable of second sight (a gift of her Goddess) and transfiguration. She is the daughter of Gorlois and Igraine and the half-sister of Arthur. She is of notable status in the eyes of the old tribes of Britain and the post Roman aristocracy, being both high priestess of Avalon and Duchess of Cornwall in her own right. Portrayed as a tragic character, Morgaine is torn between her loyalty to Avalon and her unfulfilled love for Lancelet, although she has other lovers in the book, notably Arthur, Kevin, and Accolon. Like Arthur, she is extremely charismatic. She often considers herself the victim of fate, having no choice in the decisions she makes in life. She is doomed to witness the demise of the old ways of Avalon, but in the end makes peace with certain aspects of Christianity, as she sees that she never fought the religion itself, but rather the narrow-minded views of some of its priests. She concludes that some memory of the ancient beliefs of Britain will live on, feeling that the Goddess she worshipped did not die with the coming of Christianity: rather, the Goddess just took another form in the image of the Virgin Mary. 
* Uther Pendragon is the nephew and War Duke of the dead High King Ambrosius and an ambitious warlord who falls in love with Igraine. After being betrayed by his ally Gorlois (out of jealousy rather than for political reasons), he killed him and became the High King of Britain. He fathered King Arthur and died when Arthur was in his teens. Uther is portrayed as a gifted warlord and a competent ruler. He resents and respects Vivianne for the manipulations and for forcing him to keep his vow to Avalon with threatened rebellion. 
* Igraine is the wife in turn to Gorlois and Uther, a younger sister of Viviane and older sister of Morgause and Niniane, and the mother of Morgaine and Arthur. Originally named &quot;Grainné, for the Goddess of the Beltane fires&quot;, Igraine was brought up in Avalon and married at the age of fifteen to Duke Gorlois of Cornwall, a mostly unhappy union for her. She is destined by Viviane and Taliesin to betray her husband, seduce Uther and produce the saviour of the Island of Britain (her son King Arthur). At first, she rebels, stating she is not a breeding mare, but ultimately falls in love with Uther and helps him defeat his enemies. However, the guilt about Gorlois torments her to the end. Igraine adores Morgaine before Uther enters, but she then ignores Morgaine when she and Uther marry and when Arthur is born. Igraine is described by many as stunningly beautiful, and her beauty is still remembered in Britain long after her death.
* Gorlois is Igraine&#x27;s husband and Morgaine&#x27;s father. Because Igraine was so young when they married, their relationship has been strained, but Gorlois did his best to make her feel comfortable, giving her gifts and letting her keep her daughter Morgaine. Igraine does not see how he loved her until it is too late. When Gorlois suspects that Igraine has an affair with Uther, he turns on her, accuses her of being a whore and a witch, and even breaks his oath to Uther. In the end, Uther kills him for his treachery.
* King Arthur is the son of Igraine and Uther and younger half-brother to Morgaine. He is portrayed as an able battle commander and a brilliant political mind. He is also able to inspire fanatical love and devotion among his friends and followers. He marries Gwenhwyfar by arranged marriage for a dowry of men and fine horses, but tries to truly honor and respect her. His compassion for his suffering wife — who is tormented by her childlessness and her love for Lancelet — ultimately becomes his downfall. A twist is that he is actually aware of Gwenhwyfar and Lancelet&#x27;s affair, and how unhappy both are to continually betray him, but looks the other way because he loves both his wife and his best friend too much to make them unhappy. It is suggested that, while he does love Gwenhwyfar, his deepest love is saved for Morgaine.
* Gwenhwyfar is Arthur&#x27;s beautiful but unhappy wife. She is brought up by a cold, unloving father, which left her with a deep inferiority complex and intense agoraphobia. Failing to produce an heir and unable to be with the love of her life, Lancelet, she falls into a deep depression and — hoping for salvation — becomes an increasingly fanatical Christian. Gwenhwyfar and Morgaine are depicted as polar opposites, similar only in their religious zealotry and desire to push Arthur towards their own ends. While Morgaine is at court, the two form an unlikely, yet genuinely affectionate friendship for several years. Several characters remark that Gwen is much more intelligent than she lets on. She is portrayed as a masterful housekeeper and performs the ceremonial role of high queen well. 
* Lancelet is Arthur&#x27;s First Knight, Viviane&#x27;s son (by Ban of Benwick) and Morgaine&#x27;s cousin and first love. He is an extremely gifted and handsome warrior, but has a lifelong fear of his mother. He and Gwenhwyfar are utterly infatuated, but neither has the courage (or ruthlessness) to elope. He also loves his cousin Arthur, and perhaps loves Gwenhwyfar even more because she is so close to him. He is conflicted because of his bisexuality and his infatuation with both Arthur and Gwenhwyfar.
* Mordred, a.k.a. Gwydion, is the illegitimate son of Morgaine and King Arthur. He is an unscrupulous, cunning intrigant, but in contrast to mainstream versions his motives are understandable. He sees his father Arthur as corrupt and decadent, and is convinced that he has to remove him to save Camelot. It is strongly hinted that his childhood under the cold, cunning Morgause makes him think the way he does. Mordred does share one notable trait with his mother Morgaine: he truly believes that he is a pawn of fate, with no real free will to choose his path in life. This is possibly due to the influence of the fatalistic Saxons. At one point, Mordred even lists his father&#x27;s good qualities and admits that he admires Arthur in several ways. Nevertheless, Mordred remains committed to pulling his father down from the throne of Camelot. Like both his parents, Mordred is exceptionally charming. During his first stay in Camelot, he becomes greatly admired among peasant folk and nobility alike. He is also described as exceedingly handsome; a mirror image of Lancelet as a young man. This leads many to assume he is a bastard son of Lancelet by Morgaine.
* Morgause is Morgaine&#x27;s aunt, the younger sister of Viviane and Igraine. &quot;Their mother, who had been too old for childbearing, had died giving birth to Morgause. Viviane had borne a child of her own, earlier in the year; her child had died, and Viviane had taken Morgause to nurse.&quot; She is depicted as a vain, cunning character and in contrast to her sisters, she acts purely for her own gains. She bears her sisters near lifelong resentment, Igraine for her beauty and her marriages to Gorlois and Uther, and Vivianne for choosing Igraine over her, as the linchpin in her plans for Britain. Despite her cheerful amorality, she seems to hold some true affection for Morgaine throughout the novel. She takes Morgaine in without asking any questions and treats her kindly. She seems to have had a genuinely happy marriage with Lot, who treated her as an equal and matched her in intelligence and cunning. She continues as the ruling queen of Lothian after Lot&#x27;s death. She misses Lot long after he dies and thinks of him often. She feels no regret in her regular adultery after Lot&#x27;s death and plans to use Mordred as a vehicle for her power. She seeks to be high queen of Britain, in name or de facto, for most of the novel.
* Patricius, modernized as St. Patrick, is Camelot&#x27;s most powerful Christian priest who drove the &quot;snakes&quot; (druids) from Ireland. He is portrayed in an extremely negative light, as a ruthless, misogynist religious fundamentalist.
* Elaine is Gwenhwyfar&#x27;s cousin who eventually becomes Lancelet&#x27;s wife. Elaine greatly resembles her cousin Gwenhwyfar in looks (albeit not in personality), which plays into her plan to marry Lancelet under dishonest circumstances. Morgaine offers Lancelet to Elaine on the condition that she is given Elaine&#x27;s first daughter to rear in Avalon. With Lancelet she has three children: Galahad, Nimue, and Gwenhwyfar (named after the queen). She is less passive than she lets on, and is able to successfully goad Morgaine into helping her marry Lancelet.
* Viviane is — for the most time — the High Priestess of Avalon. She is the older sister of Igraine and Morgause, mother of Balan and Lancelet, and the aunt of Morgaine, Arthur, Gawain and Gareth. She is portrayed as a strong religious and political leader; her fatal flaw is her willingness to use others in her quest to save Avalon without thinking of their emotional suffering. She is misunderstood because her family has little contact with her and that she would have to do anything to keep Camelot and Avalon and the priestesses of Avalon alive in everyone&#x27;s hearts. Viviane is killed by her older son Balan&#x27;s foster-brother, Balin.
* Taliesin (the Merlin of Britain) is the old Archdruid and harpist of Avalon. He is revered by Christians and pagans alike as a wise, kind old man. He fathered Igraine, Morgause and Niniane and is implied to have fathered Viviane as well. His mental health continually deteriorates throughout the story. (In this retelling, &quot;Merlin&quot; is a title rather than a proper name.)
* Kevin (Merlin of Britain) succeeds Taliesin after his death. He is a horribly disfigured hunchback, having been burned in a fire as a child, but can sing like an angel. He becomes Morgaine&#x27;s lover for a while and later her worst enemy. Foreseeing the demise of pagan ways, he betrays Avalon. In an ultimate attempt to unite Christianity and Avalon, so Avalon will survive, he brings the Holy Grail to Camelot. To punish him for this atrocity, Morgaine sets up Nimue to seduce and then betray him, and wants to torture him to death as a traitor. But before the torture begins, Morgaine changes her mind and has him executed swiftly out of mercy, and at the same time, a bolt of lightning incinerates the Holy Oak of Avalon. Morgaine understands that Avalon is doomed.
* Raven is a priestess of Avalon who has taken a perpetual vow of silence. Another original character, she sacrifices herself to help Morgaine save the Holy Grail from Patricius.
* Accolon is a knight loyal to Avalon, the second son of Uriens, and Morgaine&#x27;s lover. She wants him to kill King Arthur and so restore the power of Avalon; however, Arthur slays Accolon in direct combat, and Morgaine is disgraced when her role becomes evident.
* Avalloch is Uriens&#x27; eldest son. He intends to rule North Wales as a Christian king; upon discovering Morgaine and Accolon&#x27;s affair, he threatens to expose her if she does not sleep with him as well. Morgaine kills him to preserve her reputation and put Accolon in position to inherit the throne from Uriens.
* Uwaine is Uriens&#x27; youngest son and a knight loyal to Arthur. He regards Morgaine as his mother.
* Nimue is the beautiful daughter of Elaine and Lancelet. As Viviane&#x27;s granddaughter, she was to be Lady of the Lake when Morgaine dies. She is kept in constant seclusion at Avalon, and Morgaine sees her as the ultimate weapon against Camelot. Morgaine has Nimue seduce Kevin in order to abduct him, but instead falls in love with him and kills herself after she betrays him.
* Niniane is Taliesin&#x27;s daughter, making her Igraine and Morgause&#x27;s half-sister (and possible Viviane&#x27;s as well). She is a priestess who reluctantly becomes Lady of the Lake after Viviane is slain and Morgaine declines to take her place. Niniane is not as powerful or politically astute as Morgaine or Viviane, and painfully aware of her shortcomings as Lady of the Lake. She becomes Mordred&#x27;s lover, but when he announces his plans to betray Arthur, Niniane turns on him and he kills her in a fit of rage (whether this is accidental or intentional is never specified).
* Gawaine is the eldest of the four sons of Lot and Morgause and one of Arthur&#x27;s best Knights of the Round Table. He is known for being very kind, compassionate, and devoted to Arthur.
* Gareth is the youngest of the four sons of King Lot and Morgause and Knight of the Round Table. He is similar to Gawaine in both looks and personality, only more fearsome in battle. Lancelet is his childhood idol, although it is Lancelet who accidentally kills him.
* Galahad is Lancelet and Elaine&#x27;s son and Arthur&#x27;s heir to the throne. Mordred predicts that Galahad will not live to see his own crowning. Prediction proving true, Galahad dies on the quest for the Holy Grail.
* Cai is Arthur&#x27;s foster-brother. After a near fatal accident as a small child, Arthur is sent to live with Cai and his father, Ectorius. Cai and Arthur love each other very much, and after Arthur is crowned, he tells Cai, &quot;God strike me if I ever ask that you, brother, should call me [king].&quot; Cai is described as having a facial scar and a limp, two injuries that he received while protecting Arthur during a Saxon invasion. Cai is made Arthur&#x27;s knight and chamberlain, and he keeps Arthur&#x27;s castle for him.

== Writing ==
Marion Zimmer Bradley stated about her book:

==Reception==
&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is lauded as one of the most original and emotional retellings of the familiar Arthurian legend. Bradley received much praise for her convincing portrayal of the main protagonists, respectful handling of the Pagan ways of Avalon and for telling a story in which there is neither black and white nor good and evil, but several truths. Isaac Asimov called it &quot;the best retelling of the Arthurian Saga I have ever read&quot;, and Jean Auel noted &quot;I loved this book so much I went out and bought it for a friend, and have told many people about it.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; calls the book &quot;a convincing revision of the Arthurian cycle,&quot; and said that the victory of Christianity over the &quot;sane but dying paganism&quot; of Avalon &quot;ensures eons of repression for women and the vital principles they espouse.&quot; It won the 1984 Locus Award for &quot;Best Fantasy Novel&quot; and spent four months on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list in hardcover. The trade paperback edition of &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; has ranked among the top five trade paperbacks on the monthly Locus bestseller lists for almost four years.

==TV series adaptation==
&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; was adapted for television into a TNT miniseries in 2001, directed by Uli Edel.

==Extended series==
Bradley, along with Diana L. Paxson, later expanded the book into a series, including &quot;The Fall of Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Ancestors of Avalon&quot;, &quot;Sword of Avalon&quot;, &quot;Ravens of Avalon&quot;, &quot;The Forest House&quot;, &quot;Lady of Avalon&quot;, and &quot;Priestess of Avalon&quot;. J.S. Morgane&#x27;s &quot;The Spirituality of Avalon&quot; discusses the religious aspects of the Avalon series and gives insights into a modern Western understanding of spirituality and its construction in epic fantasy fiction.

<doc id="421480" wikidata="Q1106236" url="?curid=421480" title="Codex Runicus">
<text>The Codex Runicus is a codex of 202 pages written in medieval runes around the year 1300 which includes the oldest preserved Nordic provincial law, Scanian Law (&quot;Skånske lov&quot;) pertaining to the Danish land Scania (Skåneland). Codex Runicus is one of the few runic texts found on parchment. The manuscript&#x27;s initials are painted various colors and the rubrics are red. Each rune corresponds to a letter of the Latin alphabet.

The Codex Runicus has the shelfmark &quot;AM 28 8vo&quot; and is part of the Arnamagnæan Collection in the Arnamagnæan Institute at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

==Runic manuscripts==

The Codex Runicus is considered by most scholars a nostalgic or revivalist use of runes and not a natural step from the Nordic runic script culture of the Viking Age to the medieval Latin manuscript culture.

A similar use of runes in a Scandinavian manuscript from this era is known only from the small fragment &quot;SKB A 120&quot;, a religious text about Mary&#x27;s lament at the cross. The two manuscripts are similar in how the runes are formed and also in their language use, and it has therefore been suggested that they were both written by the same Scanian scribe. Some scholars argue that they were written at the scriptorium at the Cistercian monastery at Herrevad in Scania, although the idea is contested.

Some historians have considered it feasible that the Codex is a part and remainder of a formerly substantial collection of Scandinavian runic manuscripts, obliterated during the destruction of monasteries and libraries that followed the Protestant Reformation. Support for this idea has been found in reports written by Olaus Magnus, a Catholic ecclesiastic active during the 16th century in Uppsala, Sweden, who fled the country due to the Reformation. According to Olaus Magnus, there were many books written with runes in important Swedish religious centres, such as Skara and Uppsala, before the Reformation. Other historians have questioned the accuracy of his report.

==Content of the Codex==

The manuscript has three major parts: the Scanian Law (fol. 1-82), the Scanian Ecclesiastical Law (fol. 84–91), a chronicle of the early Danish monarchs (fol. 92-97) and a description of the Danish-Swedish border (fol. 97-100). The Scanian Ecclesiastical Law (&quot;Skånske Kirkelov&quot;) is a settlement detailing the administration of justice agreed upon by the Scanians and the archbishop of Lund in the late 12th century. The two law texts are written in the same hand, but the non-legal material of the codex, beginning on leaf 92, is believed to have been added in another hand, at a later date. The history section consists of a fragment of a list of Danish kings and a chronicle beginning with the legendary Danish king Hadding&#x27;s son Frode and ending with Eric VI of Denmark. Following the historical texts is a description of the oldest border between Sweden and Denmark (referred to as &quot;the Daneholm settlement&quot;). On the last leaf of Codex Runicus is a verse with musical notations - the first musical notations written in Scandinavia. It is the earliest written evidence of secular music in Denmark, a non-rhythmic notation on a four-line staff.

==Transliteration==
Like other Scandinavian manifestations of Medieval runes, the runic alphabet of the Codex Runicus contains a sign for each phoneme of the language. A dotted variant had been introduced in order to separate voiceless k from the corresponding voiced consonant g. New runes introduced for the vowel sounds also appear in the codex. 

The text on leaf 27r, from the first rubric (line 3), reads:

:&quot;Særær man annær man mæþæn kunung ær innæn lændæs bøtæ fore sar sum loh æræ :ok kunungi firitiuhu mark ok hinum ær sar fik firitiuhu mark fore friþbrut.&quot;
: (If a man wounds another man while the king is in the province he shall pay a fine for the wound in accordance with the law, and 40 marks to the king and 40 marks for breach of the peace to the one who was wounded.)

The verse with the musical notations is the first two lines of the folk song &quot;Drømde mig en drøm i nat&quot; (I dreamt a dream last night), about a girl who dreams of becoming a rich woman. The melody is one that is well known to all Danes, having been used as an interval signal on Danish radio since 1931. 

The section with the verse and musical notations are on the last leaf and reads:
:&quot;Drømde mik en drøm i nat&quot; (I dreamt a dream last night),
:&quot;um silki ok ærlik pæl&quot; (of silk and fine fur).

<text>VirtualDub is a free and open-source video capture and video processing utility for Microsoft Windows written by Avery Lee. It is designed to process linear video streams, including filtering and recompression. It uses AVI container format to store captured video. The first version of VirtualDub, written for Windows 95, to be released on SourceForge was uploaded on August 20, 2000.

In 2009, the third-party software print guide &quot;Learning VirtualDub&quot; referred to VirtualDub as &quot;the leading free Open Source video capture and processing tool&quot;. Due to its &quot;powerful&quot; versatility and usefulness especially in the field of video processing (see below), &quot;PC World&quot; has referred to VirtualDub as &quot;something of a &#x27;Photoshop&#x27; for video files&quot;, &quot;PC Perspective&quot; recommends it for its low overhead, and nextmedia&#x27;s &quot;PC &amp; Tech Authority&quot; particularly praises it for its &quot;Direct stream copy&quot; feature to avoid generational degradation of video quality when performing simple editing and trimming tasks and the fact that VirtualDub &quot;offers several valuable features that other packages lack, and helps you get quick results without any fuss or patronising wizards&quot;.

VirtualDub is recommended for use by professional computer and tech magazines, guides, and reviewers such as &quot;PC World&quot;, &quot;PC &amp; Tech Authority&quot;, &quot;PC Perspective&quot;, technologies guide website &quot;MakeTechEasier&quot;, freeware and open source software review site Ghacks, Speed Demos Archive, as well as third-party professional video production companies, and the creators of Wine.

Several hundred third-party plug-ins for VirtualDub exist, including by professional software companies. Furthermore, Debugmode Wax allows use of VirtualDub plug-ins in professional video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Vegas Pro.

==Features==
VirtualDub is designed for Microsoft Windows but may run on Linux and Mac OS X using Wine (for example, to use it with the popular Deshaker plugin). However, native support for these systems is not available.

VirtualDub was made to operate exclusively on AVI files; however, a plugin API was added from version 1.7.2 which allows the import of other formats. Appropriate video and audio codecs need to be installed.

===Video capture===
VirtualDub supports both DirectShow and Video for Windows for video capture. Capture features include capture to any AVI variant, audio VU meters, overlay and preview modes, histogram, selectable crop area, video noise reduction, auto stop settings (based on capture time, file size, free space, and/or dropped frames), and designate alternate drive(s) for capture overflow.

VirtualDub can help overcome problems with digital cameras that also record video. Many models, especially Canon, record in an M-JPEG format incompatible with Sony Vegas 6.0 and 7.0. Saving AVI files as &quot;old-style AVI&quot; files allows them to appear in Vegas.

VirtualDub supports DV capture from Type 2 (VfW) FireWire controllers only (It cannot work with Type 1). There is no DV batch capture, still image capture, or DV device control capability.

===Video assembly===
VirtualDub can create a video file from a series of image files in Truevision TGA or Windows Bitmap file formats. Individual frames must be given file names numbered in sequential order without any gaps (e.g. 001.bmp, 002.bmp, 003.bmp..). From those, the frame rate can be adjusted, and other modifications such as the addition of a soundtrack can be made.

VirtualDub can also disassemble a video by extracting its soundtracks saving its frames into Truevision TGA or Windows Bitmap files.

===Editing===
VirtualDub can delete segments of a video file, append new segments, or reorder existing segments. Appended segments must have similar audio and video formats, dimensions, number of audio channels, frame rates and sampling rates. Otherwise, VirtualDub is incapable of mixing dissimilar video files or adding transition effects between segments.

===Video processing===
VirtualDub comes with a number of video editing components known as &quot;filters&quot;. They can perform basic tasks as arbitrary resize, converting the video to grayscale, arbitrary rotation, crop, or changing simple values like brightness and contrast. Filters may be used during the video assembly as well. Filter plug-ins further extend VirtualDub&#x27;s capabilities. A plug-in SDK is available for developers to create their own video and audio filters.

Besides those basic features, its many third-party plug-ins make VirtualDub a &quot;powerful&quot; open-source tool when it comes to linear video processing, and in fact most of the hundreds of third-party plug-ins available for VirtualDub are filters related to either aesthetic effects or cleaning, fixing, and restoring image quality, such as various denoising and sharpening methods targeted especially at analogue and digital video signal and film defects (be they related to VHS, faulty cables, a distorted analogue terrestrial or satellite TV reception, or digital compression), deinterlacing and fields manipulation, colorspace conversion and manipulation, reverse telecine aka IVTC, deflickering, deshaking, adding and removing logos and subtitles, analysis of video content, etc.

All of these processing features are fully batchable to apply the same effects on a large number of files.

==Development==
VirtualDub is free software, released under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later and hosted on SourceForge.net.

VirtualDub was originally created by the author, then a college student, for the purpose of compressing anime videos of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. It was written to read and write AVI videos, but support for input plug-ins was added, enabling it to read additional formats including MPEG-2, Matroska, Flash Video, Windows Media, QuickTime, MP4 and others. Development stopped as of 2013 and the site&#x27;s forums closed down in 2015.

VirtualDub has spawned several forks, including VirtualDubMod and &quot;Nandub&quot;.

===VirtualDub2===
The latest fork is called VirtualDub2 (formerly VirtualDub FilterMod). It has all the features of the original VirtualDub, plus support for high bit-depth (i.e., deep color). It is no longer limited to Video for Windows (Video Compression Manager) codecs, and AVI format limitations (such as limited VBR support, H.264/HEVC minor incompatibilities etc.).

VirtualDub2 has built-in encode/decode of any container and video and audio compression formats supported by FFmpeg (H.264, HEVC, VP9, AAC, Opus and other formats) and can open and save QuickTime File Format (MOV), MP4, Matroska, WebM, AVI based on FFmpeg or only the audio from a video in M4A, Opus in Matroska, Ogg Opus, Vorbis, AAC or MP3 formats.

It also has improved navigation, display and user interface (e.g. pan display when zoomed in, color format selection), improved performance, and support for high bit-depth color formats.

===Past legal issues===
Early versions of VirtualDub supported importing of Microsoft&#x27;s Advanced Systems Format, but this was removed in version 1.3d following an informal phone call from a Microsoft employee in 2000 claiming that it infringed one of Microsoft&#x27;s patents. Microsoft never identified any specific patent numbers that it believed to have been infringed, but speculation by others is that (expired in 2017) might be relevant.

In August 2006, VirtualDub&#x27;s German users who hosted copies of VirtualDub, or even linked to them on their web pages, began receiving cease and desist letters from a private individual that claimed to have German word mark on &quot;VirtualDub&quot;. However this issue has been resolved: the word mark in Germany has been deleted and an injunction has been granted against the former owner of said word mark.

<text>VirtualDubMod is an open-source video capture and processing tool for Microsoft Windows, based on Avery Lee&#x27;s VirtualDub.

==History==
The final version, 1.5.10.2, was released on 29 August 2005. Version 1.5.10.2 (build 2542) was released on 21 February 2006. In February 2005, &quot;fccHandler&quot;, an administrator on the VirtualDub forums, claimed that development had been discontinued. A version labeled &quot;VirtualDubMod 1.6.0.0 SURROUND&quot; was released by a company called Aud-X in April 2006. A version 1.5.10.3 (build 2550) was released by www.virtualdub-fr.org (created by &quot;Sparad0x&quot;) on 1 January 2008.

==Features==
VirtualDubMod merged several specialized forks of VirtualDub posted on the Doom9 forums. Added features included Matroska (MKV) support, OGM support, and MPEG-2 support.

One notable feature that remains missing in VirtualDubMod is the ability to program timed video captures, which was present in one VirtualDub fork called VirtualDubVCR.

Despite the abandonment of development of VirtualDubMod, some of its features can be added to VirtualDub through input plugins and ACM codecs provided by users on VirtualDub forums.

In 1854, Western Australia issued its first stamps, featuring the colony&#x27;s symbol, the black swan, as did all WA stamps until 1902. While the 1d black was engraved in Great Britain by Perkins Bacon, other values, including the 4d blue, were produced by Horace Samson in Perth using lithography, and with different frames around the swan design for each value.

== The error ==
In January 1855, additional 4d stamps were needed. When Alfred Hillman brought the printing stone out of storage, he found that two of the impressions had been damaged, so he had to redo them. One of the replaced frames was tilted; the other was accidentally redone upside-down. The stone&#x27;s block of 60 was transferred four times to make the printing stone, and 97 sheets were printed before Hillman discovered the mistake and corrected it, resulting in a total of 388 errors being printed.

However, the errors went unrecognised and unreported for several years. Only 15 complete copies, plus a part of a stamp in a strip of three, have survived. No unused copies are known.

One example was discovered in Ireland in the 1860s, acquired by the Duke of Leinster, and bequeathed to Ireland in 1897. It is on display at a museum in Dublin. It was on displayed in 1890 at Royal Philatelic Society London&#x27;s first philatelic exhibition. Other examples are in the Royal Collection, the Tapling Collection of the British Museum, at the State Library of New SOuth Wales and at museums in Sydney, and Perth, in addition to private collections.

In 1927 the locations of the nine known copies were listed in the Brisbane Telegraph. 1 - Collection of the Royal Family of Windsor. 2- Tapling collection, British Museum. 3 - Leinster collection, Dublin Science and Art Museum. 4 - White collection, State Library of New South Wales. 5 - EH Collins. 6 - PR England. 7 - Dr HA James. 8 - JA Nix. 9 - L Meinertzhagen

Copies of this stamp have been sold over the years such as, a 1980 auction realisation US$80,000, for $37,500 in 1983 and for £122,400 in a Spink auction on 19 May 2015.

<text>József Mindszenty (; 29 March 18926 May 1975) was a Hungarian cardinal of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Esztergom and leader of the Catholic Church in Hungary from 1945 to 1973. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, for five decades &quot;he personified uncompromising opposition to fascism and communism in Hungary&quot;. 

During World War II, Mindszenty was imprisoned by the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party. After the war, he opposed communism and communist persecution in his country. As a result, he was tortured and given a life sentence in a 1949 show trial that generated worldwide condemnation, including a United Nations resolution.

After eight years in prison, Mindszenty was freed in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and granted political asylum by the United States embassy in Budapest. He lived there for the next fifteen years. He was finally allowed to leave the country in 1971, and died in exile in 1975 in Vienna, Austria.

His cause for sainthood was opened in 1993 and Pope Francis declared him Venerable in 2019.

==Early life and career==
Mindszenty was born on 29 March 1892 in Csehimindszent, Vas County, Austria-Hungary, to József Pehm and Borbála Kovács. His father was a magistrate. He attended St Norbert&#x27;s Premonstratensian High Grammar School in Szombathely, before entering the Szombathely Diocesan Seminary in 1911.

Mindszenty was ordained a priest by Bishop János Mikes on 12 June 1915, the Feast of the Sacred Heart. In 1917, the first of his books, &quot;Motherhood&quot;, was published. He was arrested by Mihály Károlyi&#x27;s progressive government on 9 February 1919 for speaking out against its &#x27;socialist policies&#x27;, then rearrested by the communist Béla Kun government on 31 July that year.

In 1939, Mindszenty urged his followers to vote against the Arrow Cross Party. In 1940, he published a pamphlet, &quot;The Green Communism&quot;, in which he characterized the Hungarian Nyilas Nazi Movement as diabolic and as evil as the communists. Green was the color of the Nyilas uniform.

In 1941, during a Magyarization campaign amongst Germans living in Hungary, he adopted his new Hungarian name of Mindszenty, part of his home village&#x27;s name. On 25 March 1944, he was consecrated Bishop of Veszprém. Mindszenty organized a letter to the Nazi authorities urging them not to fight in Western Hungary; he also protested to Miklós Horthy in favor of converted Jews. After Horthy was overthrown, Mindszenty was arrested on 27 November 1944 for his opposition to the Arrow Cross government&#x27;s plan to quarter soldiers in parts of his official palace. In April 1945, with the Arrow Cross puppet state collapsing, Mindszenty was released from house arrest at a church in Sopron.

==Church leader and opposition to communism==
Following the fall of the Kingdom of Hungary, Mindszenty was disappointed, as &quot;deep down in his soul he remained a monarchist to the end of his life.&quot; On 15 September 1945, Mindszenty was appointed Primate of Hungary and Archbishop of Esztergom, the seat of the head of the Catholic Church in Hungary. On 21 February 1946, Archbishop Mindszenty was elevated to Cardinal-Priest of Santo Stefano Rotondo by Pope Pius XII, who reportedly told him, &quot;Among these thirty-two you will be the first to suffer the martyrdom symbolized by this red color.&quot;

To the ruling Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party, Mindszenty was regarded as the archetypal figure of &quot;clerical reaction&quot;. He continued to use the traditional title of prince-primate () even after the use of noble and royal titles was outlawed by the 1946 puppet parliament. He contacted the US embassy, asking it to &quot;engage in activities which were simply not diplomatically proper or politically feasible&quot;, for which he was rebuked by the embassy. In addition to such contacts, the Party accused him of having &quot;aristocratic attitudes&quot; and attacked his demands for compensation following the state seizure of church-owned farmlands during the Party&#x27;s campaign to abolish private farm ownership. Because the main source of income for the Church was its agricultural lands, confiscations by the communist government left many Church-run institutions destitute.

Cardinal Mindszenty believed and preached that &quot;The Church asks for no secular protection; it seeks shelter under the protection of God alone&quot;. For this reason, he fought fiercely against the state policy to emancipate the Hungarian educational system from Church control by seizing parochial schools.

In 1948, religious orders were banned by the government. Soon after, the communist dictator in Hungary, Mátyás Rákosi accused the Cardinal and the Catholic Church of being both &quot;the largest landowner in Hungary&quot; and &quot;a reactionary force in our country, supporting the monarchy and later the fascist dictatorship of Admiral Horthy&quot;. These, Rákosi claimed, were the only reasons for Mindszenty&#x27;s opposition to the Party&#x27;s policy of land confiscation.

On 26 December 1948, Cardinal Mindszenty was arrested and accused of treason, conspiracy, and other offences against the new Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. Shortly before his arrest, he wrote a note to the effect that he had not been involved in any conspiracy and that any confession he might make would be the result of duress. While imprisoned, Mindszenty was repeatedly hit with rubber truncheons and subjected to other forms of abuse, until he agreed to confess.

Mindszenty&#x27;s forced confession included the following &quot;admissions&quot;: orchestrating the theft of the Crown of Saint Stephen for the sole purpose of crowning Crown Prince Otto von Habsburg as King of Hungary, scheming to overthrow the Party and reestablish capitalism, planning a third World War, and, once it had been won by the Americans, plotting to assume supreme political power himself.

Almost alone among the Western news media, reporter George Seldes, who had previously been expelled from the Soviet Union and fascist Italy for his reporting, believed the allegations against Cardinal Mindszenty. Seldes spent the rest of his life accusing Mindszenty of being a Nazi collaborator, a Holocaust perpetrator, and a virulent antisemite. In his 1987 memoirs, Seldes wrote, &quot;In 1948 the entire American section of the resident foreign press corps in Hungary implored me to report the facts about Cardinal Mindszenty&#x27;s collaboration with the Nazis, his part in the deportation of the Jewish population to Hitler&#x27;s death camps, and also to expose the scores of fraudulent news items coming from outside Hungary, from Vienna, London, Prague, and Rome especially, alleging drugging and torturing of the Cardinal.&quot; Seldes was the only one to dispute that Mindszenty was tortured by the Communists. The Pope and the international community at the time believed that Mindszenty had been tortured. Even at his show trial, the prosecution did not make the charge or provide evidence of antisemitism or Nazi collaboration.

On 3 February 1949, Mindszenty&#x27;s show trial began. The Cardinal admitted to being involved in a Habsburg restorationist organization which planned to form a government after an American invasion, however he denied hoping for the outbreak of war. He said &quot;we prayed for peace&quot;. He accepted the charges of smuggling tens of thousands of dollars into Hungary, and admitted his contacts with Otto von Habsburg and American politicians, but did not admit to willful espionage on behalf of foreign powers. In court, Mindszenty said about the charges: &quot;I do not deny one or another part of it, but I do not subscribe to the conclusion&quot;. As he followed the trial, a weeping Pope Pius XII told Sister Pascalina Lehnert, &quot;My words have come true and all I can do is pray; I cannot help him any other way.&quot; On 8 February, Mindszenty was sentenced to life imprisonment for black marketeering, treason and espionage. The government released a white book, &quot;Documents on the Mindszenty Case&quot;, containing his alleged confessions and case materials.

On 12 February 1949, Pope Pius XII announced the excommunication of all persons involved in the trial and conviction of Mindszenty. On 20 February 1949, the Pope addressed a series of questions to a crowd which had gathered in St. Peter&#x27;s Square to protest the Cardinal&#x27;s show trial, asking:Do you want a Church that remains silent when She should speak; that diminishes the law of God where She is called to proclaim it loudly, wanting to accommodate it to the will of man? Do you want a Church that departs from the unshakable foundations upon which Christ founded Her, taking the easy way of adapting Herself to the opinion of the day; a Church that is a prey to current trends; a Church that does not condemn the suppression of conscience and does not stand up for the just liberty of the people; a Church that locks Herself up within the four walls of Her temple in unseemly sycophancy, forgetting the divine mission received from Christ: &#x27;Go out the crossroads and preach the people&#x27;? Beloved sons and daughters! Spiritual heirs of numberless confessors and martyrs! Is this the Church you venerate and love? Would you recognize in such a Church the features of your Mother? Would you be able to imagine a Successor of St. Peter submitting to such demands?According to Sister Pascalina, who witnessed the rally, &quot;In reply to the Holy Father came a single cry like thunder still ringing in our ears: &#x27;No!&#x27;&quot;

In &quot;Acerrimo moerore&quot;, an apostolic letter to the Hungarian Episcopate, the Pope publicly condemned the Cardinal&#x27;s conviction and described his tortures..

Over seven years later, on 30 October 1956, in the midst of the Hungarian Revolution, Mindszenty was released from prison. He returned to Budapest the next day, and on 2 November, praised the insurgents. The following day, he made a radio broadcast in favor of recent anti-communist developments.

==Confinement at the US embassy==
On 4 November 1956, when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to restore the communist government, Cardinal Mindszenty sought Imre Nagy&#x27;s advice, and was granted political asylum at the United States embassy in Budapest. Mindszenty lived there for the next 15 years, unable to leave the grounds, and did not participate in the papal conclaves of 1958 and 1963.

György Aczél, the communist official in charge of all cultural and religious matters in Hungary, felt increasingly uncomfortable about Mindszenty&#x27;s plight in the late 1960s when the latter fell seriously ill and rumors spread of his impending death. Yet Aczél failed to convince party leader János Kádár that commuting Mindszenty&#x27;s sentence would create valuable confusion in the Holy See and allow the state to better control the remaining clergy.

==Exile==
Eventually, Pope Paul VI offered a compromise: declaring Mindszenty a &quot;victim of history&quot; (instead of communism) and annulling the excommunication imposed on the people involved in his trial. The Hungarian government allowed Mindszenty to leave the country on 28 September 1971. 
 Beginning on 23 October 1971, he lived in Vienna, Austria, as he took offence at Rome&#x27;s advice that he should resign from the primacy of the Catholic Church in Hungary in exchange for uncensored publication of his memoirs backed by the Holy See. Although most bishops retire at or near age 75, Mindszenty continually denied rumors of his resignation and was not required by canon law to step down at the time.

In December 1973, at the age of 81, Mindszenty was stripped of his titles by the Pope, who declared the Archdiocese of Esztergom officially vacated, but who refused to fill the seat while Mindszenty was still alive. Mindszenty visited Hungarian emigrants in 1975 in Caracas, Venezuela, and then Bogotá, Colombia. Just after this visit, he traveled back to Europe feeling quite ill. Mindszenty died on 6 May 1975, at the age of 83, in exile in Vienna. In early 1976, the Pope made Bishop László Lékai the primate of Hungary, ending a long struggle with the communist government.

==Legacy==
In 1991, Mindszenty&#x27;s remains were repatriated to Esztergom by the newly elected government and buried in the basilica there.
Mindszenty is widely admired in modern-day Hungary for his courage and resolve while opposing the Arrow Cross Party, during Communist imprisonment, and in exile.

The Mindszenty Museum in Esztergom is dedicated to the life of the Cardinal. A commemorative statue of Cardinal Mindszenty stands at St. Ladislaus Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey, US. A monument was donated by the Hungarian community of Greater Cleveland in 1977 and stands at Cardinal Mindszenty Plaza in downtown Cleveland. Mindszenty is remembered in Santiago, Chile with a memorial in Parque Bustamante, the same park where a monument to the martyrs of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution stands.

In June 1974, Cardinal Mindszenty visited the Woodside Priory School in Portola Valley, California. The school was founded by seven Hungarian Benedictine monks, associated with Saint Martin&#x27;s Archabbey in Pannonhalma, who fled the repression in Hungary following the 1956 revolution. A bronze memorial was placed on the school&#x27;s campus noting his visit. The Cardinal&#x27;s visit to the San Francisco Bay Area included Mass in December 1974 at St. Raymond Church in Menlo Park, California; a monument commemorating the service was placed on parish grounds.

==Beatification process==
The beatification and eventual canonization of Cardinal Mindszenty has been on the Hungarian Catholic Church&#x27;s agenda ever since communism fell in 1989, and the 2005–2013 pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI was seen by many analysts as an excellent opportunity to achieve both, as the Pope had commented favourably on Mindszenty&#x27;s calling and legacy.

The cause for the cardinal&#x27;s beatification opened on 15 June 1993; Mindszenty became titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) assented to introducing the cause in a decree &quot;nihil obstat&quot; (&quot;no objection&quot;). The diocesan process (collecting his spiritual writings and collecting witness interrogatories to attest to his reputation for holiness) opened in Esztergom on 19 March 1994 and closed 17 October 1996; the CCS validated the process as having complied with their regulations in Rome on 8 November 1999. In 2012, the Hungarian Bishops&#x27; Conference reaffirmed its support for continuing the late cardinal&#x27;s cause for beatification. Theologians voiced their approval for the cause on 14 June 2018.

Pope Francis declared Mindszenty venerable on 12 February 2019.

==In popular culture==

Mindszenty&#x27;s life and battle against the Soviet domination of Hungary and communism were the subject of the 1950 American film &quot;Guilty of Treason&quot;, partly based on his personal papers and starring Charles Bickford as the cardinal.

The 1955 British thriller &quot;The Prisoner&quot; is loosely based on Mindszenty&#x27;s imprisonment, with Alec Guinness playing a fictionalized version of the cardinal.

Mindszenty is reported to have disliked at least one of his film portrayals.

The two-part 1966 episode &quot;Old Man Out&quot; of television&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was loosely based on Mindszenty. The episode&#x27;s premise was that a Catholic cardinal, a political prisoner and hero to his people, was slated for execution in an Eastern European prison. The series&#x27; protagonists were tasked with smuggling him out of the prison and country before his execution.

<doc id="421511" wikidata="Q1687520" url="?curid=421511" title="Jerald and Sandra Tanner">
<text>Jerald Dee Tanner (June 1, 1938 – October 1, 2006) and Sandra McGee Tanner (born January 14, 1941) are American writers and researchers who publish archival and evidential materials about the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Tanners founded the Utah Lighthouse Ministry (UTLM), whose stated mission is &quot;to document problems with the claims of Mormonism and compare LDS doctrines with Christianity&quot;. As of 2025 Sandra Tanner continues to operate the ministry after Jerald&#x27;s death in 2006.

The Tanners, who are ex-Mormon, printed original versions of early Mormon writings and scripture in which they annotated and highlighted doctrinal changes, such as the rejection of Brigham Young&#x27;s &quot;Adam–God doctrine&quot;. They jointly published more than 40 books about many aspects of the LDS Church, primarily its history.

==Biographies==
Jerald Tanner was born in Provo, Utah, and was a fifth-generation Mormon. He studied at the University of Utah and received a degree from Salt Lake Trade Technical Institute. His great-great-grandfather, John Tanner, gave large donations to church founder Joseph Smith when the fledgling church was deeply in debt.

Like her husband, Sandra was a fifth-generation Mormon. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Brigham Young, the LDS Church&#x27;s second president. Both families had longstanding ties to the Mormon community.

They met in the spring of 1959, in Salt Lake City, at a religious meeting of Pauline Hancock&#x27;s Church of Christ (Lukeite), Soon after they were introduced, Jerald and Sandra began jointly researching the subject of Mormonism. Each had been raised as Latter-day Saints, but discovered that they had each begun questioning the church in their teenage years.

Jerald and Sandra Tanner were married by a Protestant minister in Mission Hills, California, on June 14, 1959. The following year, both resigned from the LDS Church. In 1964, they began an outreach to Mormons at their house in Salt Lake City, which grew into UTLM. They had two daughters and a son together. After 47 years of marriage, Jerald died in Salt Lake City on October 1, 2006, as a result of complications arising from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He had retired a few months before his death.

==Publications==

===The Salt Lake City Messenger===

&quot;The Salt Lake City Messenger&quot; was a biannual newsletter they published from 1964 to 2022 containing copies of primary documents and discussion critical of LDS history.

===Joseph Smith Egyptian Papers===
The Tanners have specialized in publishing original documents that would otherwise be inaccessible to the general public. For example, in 1966, they were the first to publish Joseph Smith&#x27;s &quot;Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar&quot; (since called the &quot;Joseph Smith Egyptian Papers&quot;). Prior to their publication, few LDS Church members knew about these documents. The next year, the publication prompted discussions and debates about the content of the documents, which have continued for decades.

Joseph Smith said that, in addition to translating the golden plates, he translated the &quot;Book of Abraham&quot; papyri. These materials were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, in 1966 scholars found ten fragments of the papyri in the archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Subsequently, an additional fragment was located in the LDS Church Historian&#x27;s Office. 

The papyri have been determined to be portions of Egyptian funerary texts, dating to about the first century BC. The LDS Church disputes the Tanners&#x27; position stating in an Ensign article, &quot;…some people have concluded that this Book of Breathings must be the text Joseph Smith used in his translation of the book of Abraham. However, there are some serious problems associated with this assumption. First of all, from paleographic and historical considerations, the Book of Breathings papyrus can reliably be dated to around A.D. 60–much too late for Abraham to have written it. Of course, it could be a copy–or a copy of a copy–of the original written by Abraham. However, a second problem arises when one compares the text of the book of Abraham with a translation of the Book of Breathings; they clearly are not the same…&quot;

The Tanners contend that the &quot;Book of Abraham&quot; is a 19th-century work written only by Joseph Smith.

===Other documents and books===

The Tanners have also published photo-mechanical reproductions of texts such as complete sets of early-LDS periodicals, including &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot;, &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, and the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. Also notable is a reproduction of the 1825 edition of Ethan Smith&#x27;s &quot;View of the Hebrews.&quot; Their version contains the margin notes made by Elder B. H. Roberts, who compared this text with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; at the request of an LDS leader. His report was initially kept secret, but it gradually was distributed within Mormon circles and was published posthumously as part of &quot;A Book of Mormon Study&quot; (also known as &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot;) and &quot;A Parallel&quot;. 

The Tanners have published compiled lists of changes to the text of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; and other texts used by the LDS church. They argue that the alterations are substantial and that the inconsistencies in the texts are evidence against LDS claims of their being divinely inspired. This is because of the Tanner&#x27;s interpretation of Joseph Smith&#x27;s claim the Book of Mormon was &quot;the most correct book on the face of the Earth… and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.&quot;

The best-known publication produced by the Tanners is &quot;Mormonism: Shadow or Reality?,&quot; originally published in 1963 as &quot;Mormonism: A Study of Mormon History and Doctrine&quot;, and reprinted five times since. Dean M. Helland of Oral Roberts University describes it as &quot;the heavyweight of all books on Mormonism&quot;. The Tanners question the character and integrity of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon; they discuss the different accounts that Joseph Smith gave of the First Vision. Their book includes copies of original LDS documents.

==Legal challenges==

In 1999, the LDS Church sued the Tanners for internet linking from their website to the copyrighted &quot;Church Handbook of Instructions.&quot; The lawsuit was settled out of court before an appeals court could rule on what observers described as a potentially landmark case concerning internet linking.

==Criticism==
Lawrence Foster, a non-Mormon historian of Mormon history, has offered a mixed assessment of the Tanners and their work. On the negative side, Foster has written that, until the Tanners &quot;are prepared to abide by accepted standards of scholarly behavior and common courtesy, they can expect little sympathy from serious historians.&quot; He criticized them for &quot;a holier-than-thou stance, refusing to be fair in applying the same debate standard of absolute rectitude that they demand of Mormonism to their own actions, writings, and beliefs… The Tanners seem to be playing a skillful shell game in which the premises for judgment are conveniently shifted so that the conclusion is always the same—negative.&quot;

On a more positive note, Foster says that some of the Tanners&#x27; &quot;research and analysis... would do credit to any professional historian.&quot; He credits them with being &quot;more than simply gadflies&quot; and says that their work has helped stimulate serious Mormon scholarship.

D. Michael Quinn, a historian and former member of the LDS Church, took issue with the Tanners&#x27; work. He noted that &quot;although the most conscientious and honest researcher can overlook pertinent sources of information, the repeated omissions of evidence by the Tanners suggest an intentional avoidance of sources that modify or refute their caustic interpretation of Mormon history.&quot;

==Challenging anti-Mormonism==
On occasion, the Tanners have publicly challenged critics of Mormonism and earned praise from some LDS scholars. For instance, the historian Daniel C. Peterson, the former chairman of Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) at Brigham Young University, suggested the Tanners&#x27; willingness to debunk false documents, regardless of their content, was a sign of integrity:

The Tanners were among the first public critics of the forger and later murderer Mark Hofmann. Hofmann&#x27;s &quot;discoveries&quot; of important Mormon documents he had secretly forged appeared to bolster the Tanners&#x27; arguments, but by early 1984, Jerald Tanner had concluded there was significant doubt as to the Salamander Letter&#x27;s authenticity. He even went as far as to publish an attack on the Salamander Letter, shocking many scholars, historians, and students who believed the document was genuine. By late 1984, he questioned the authenticity of most, if not all, of Hofmann&#x27;s discoveries, largely for their undocumented provenance. He was ultimately vindicated when Hofmann&#x27;s forgeries were exposed. 

The Tanners have debunked what they characterize as misrepresentations of the LDS Church by Ed Decker, a Christian evangelist. They criticized his film &quot;The God Makers II&quot;, despite their involvement in his earlier film, &quot;The God Makers&quot;.

<text>A Dobsonian telescope is an altazimuth-mounted Newtonian telescope design popularized by John Dobson in 1965 and credited with vastly increasing the size of telescopes available to amateur astronomers. Dobson&#x27;s telescopes featured a simplified mechanical design that was easy to manufacture from readily available components to create a large, portable, low-cost telescope. The design is optimized for observing faint deep-sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies. This type of observation requires a large objective diameter (i.e. light-gathering power) of relatively short focal length and portability for travel to less light-polluted locations.

Dobsonians are intended to be what is commonly called a &quot;light bucket&quot;. Operating at low magnification, the design therefore omits features found in other amateur telescopes such as equatorial tracking. Dobsonians are popular in the amateur telescope making community, where the design was pioneered and continues to evolve. A number of commercial telescope makers also sell telescopes based on this design. The term &quot;Dobsonian&quot; is currently used for a range of large-aperture Newtonian reflectors that use some of the basic Dobsonian design characteristics, regardless of the materials from which they are constructed.

==Origin and design==
It is hard to classify the Dobsonian telescope as a single invention. In the field of amateur telescope making most, if not all, of its design features had been used before. John Dobson, credited as having invented this design in 1965, pointed out that &quot;for hundreds of years, wars were fought using cannon on &#x27;Dobsonian&#x27; mounts&quot;.

Dobson identified the characteristic features of the design as lightweight objective mirrors made from porthole glass, and mountings constructed from plywood, Teflon strips and other low-cost materials. Since he built these telescopes as aids in his avocation of instructional sidewalk astronomy, he preferred to call the design a &quot;sidewalk telescope&quot;. Dobson combined all these innovations in a design focused towards one goal: building a very large, inexpensive, easy to use, portable telescope, one that could bring deep-sky astronomy to the masses.

===Dobson&#x27;s design innovations===

Dobson&#x27;s design allows a builder with minimal skills to make a very large telescope out of common items. Dobson optimized the design for observation of faint objects such as star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies (what amateur astronomers call &quot;deep sky object&quot;s). These dim objects require a large objective mirror able to gather a large amount of light. Because &quot;deep sky&quot; observing often requires travel to dark locations away from city lights, the design benefits from being more compact, portable, and rugged than standard large Newtonian telescopes of times past, which typically utilized massive German equatorial mounts. John Dobson&#x27;s telescopes combined several innovations to meet these criteria, including:

* Nontraditional alt-azimuth mount: Instead of a standard mount using axial bearings, Dobson opted for a very stable design that was simple to build, and which had fewer mechanical limitations when used with large and heavy telescopes. He modified the classical fork mount into a free-standing three-piece construction, which holds the telescope steady on seven discrete support points and allows for easy and safe repositioning of a large and heavy telescope.
** The classical Dobsonian mount (refer to Fig.1) consists of a flat horizontal &quot;ground board&quot; platform (Fig.1, black) on top of which are attached three of the seven supports (Fig.1, bottom yellow). Upon these three supports rests a box construction called a &quot;rocker box&quot; (Fig.1, dark blue). A loose center-bolt (Fig.1, dark green) keeps the rocker box centered and allows it to pivot above the ground board. On opposing sides of the rocker box, semicircular depressions are cut out from the top edge of each wall (the rocker box is open on the top and on the back). Each depression has a widely spaced pair of supports installed in the cut (Fig.1, top yellow). The telescope optical tube assembly (OTA, Fig.1, light blue) has two large round trunnions (or arc-shaped rails for larger telescopes) secured on the left and right sides (Fig.1, red). Their common axis intersects the center of gravity of the telescope OTA. The trunnions (commonly known as altitude bearings) rest atop the aforementioned four supports in the top cutouts of the rocker box. To raise the telescope (altitude), just lift the tube and the trunnions will slide over the four supports. To move the telescope left or right (azimuth), push or pull the top rim of the OTA (some have a dedicated handle) so that the pivoting rocker box slides over the ground board&#x27;s three supports. 
** Classical Dobsonian mount parts are typically made from plywood and other cheap materials which are glued, screwed, or even nailed together. In contrast to other telescope mount types, no precision-machined mechanical parts are required. For smooth sliding motions, small Teflon (PTFE) blocks are used for the seven supports. Their surface sizes can be precisely calculated for the particular OTA weight. To improve the smoothness and steady position-holding, the bottom of the rocker box is typically covered with micro-textured Formica. The altitude trunnions often have a large diameter, and can also be covered with textured material. For larger telescopes, semicircular wood pieces or arc-shaped rails can be used instead of round trunnions.
** The use of Teflon over textured material combines with gravity-produced wedging forces to create a unique smooth action, transitioning from rock steady to smooth motion and back. Thus a clamp mechanism is not needed to prevent unintentional motion of the telescope, unlike most other telescope mounts. The steadiness of the classical Dobsonian is unparalleled, as the telescope is actually not rotating on two axes as other mounts but instead statically standing on seven solid blocks (until pushed to a new position). Only the Ball-Scope mount invented later can rival the steady smoothness of a Dobsonian.

* Thin mirrors: Instead of costly Pyrex mirror blanks with the standard 1:6 thickness ratios (1 cm thick for every 6 cm in diameter) so they don&#x27;t flex and sag out of shape under their own weight, Dobson used mirrors made out of glass from surplus ship porthole covers usually with 1:16 thickness ratios. Since the telescope design has an alt-azimuth mount, the mirror only has to be supported in a simple cell with a backing of indoor/outdoor carpet to evenly support the weight of the much thinner mirror.

* Construction tubes: Dobson replaced the traditional aluminum or fiberglass telescope tube with the thick compressed paper tubes used in construction to pour concrete columns. &quot;Sonotubes&quot;, the leading brand employed by Dobson, are less expensive than commercially available telescope tubes and are available in a wide variety of sizes. For protection against moisture, the tubes were usually painted or coated with plastic. Sonotubes are claimed to be more rugged than aluminum or fiberglass tubes which can dent or shatter from impacts during transport. They have the added advantage of being thermally stable and non-conductive, which minimizes unwanted convection currents in the light path caused by handling of the tube assembly. 

* A square &quot;mirrorbox&quot;: Dobson often used a plywood box for the tube base and mirror housing, into which the Sonotube was inserted. This gave a rigid flat surface to attach the mirror supports, and made it easy to attach the trunnions.

The design of Dobsonian telescopes has evolved over the years (see ), but most commercial or amateur-built &quot;Dobsonian&quot; telescopes follow many or most of the design concepts and features listed above.

==Characteristics==
The Dobsonian design has the following characteristics:
*Altazimuth mount: An equatorial telescope mount with clock drive was left out of the design. Equatorial mounts tend to be massive (less portable), expensive, complicated, and have the characteristics of putting the eyepiece of Newtonian telescopes in very hard to access positions. Altazimuth mounts cut the size, weight and cost of the total telescope and keep the eyepiece in a relatively easy to access position on the side of the telescope. The altazimuth mount design used in Dobsonian designs also adds to simplicity and portability; there is no added mass or need to transport counter weights, drive components, or tripods/pedestals. Setting up for hard tube dobs simply involves placing the mount on the ground, and setting the tube on top of it. The weight of the Dobsonian style altazimuth mount is distributed over large simple bearing surfaces so the telescope can move smoothly under finger pressure with minimal backlash.
:The altazimuth mount does have its own limitations. Un-driven altazimuth mounted telescopes need to be &quot;nudged&quot; every few minutes along both axes to compensate for the rotation of the Earth to keep an object in view (as opposed to one axis for un-driven equatorial mounts), an exercise that becomes more difficult with higher magnifications. The altazimuth mount does not allow the use of conventional setting circles to help in aiming the telescope at the coordinates of known objects. They are known for being difficult to point at objects near the zenith, mainly because a large movement of the azimuth axis is needed to move the telescope pointing by even a small amount. Altazimuth mounts are also not well suited for astrophotography.

*Large objective diameter compared to mass/cost
**&quot;Low mass to objective size ratio&quot;: The Dobsonian design&#x27;s structure as measured in volume and weight is relatively minimal for any given objective diameter when compared to other designs.
**&quot;Low cost to objective size ratio&quot;: From a cost perspective, a user typically gets more objective diameter per unit of cost with the Dobsonian design.
*Good &quot;Deep Sky&quot; telescope: The Dobsonian design of maximized objective diameter combined with portability makes the design ideal for observing dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies (deep sky objects), an activity that requires large objectives and travel to dark sky locations. Since these objects are relatively large, they are observed at low magnifications that do not require a clock-driven mount.
*Balance Issues: Designs that have the telescope tube fixed in relationship to its altitude bearings can be put out of balance by the addition or subtraction of equipment such as cameras, finderscopes or even unusually heavy eyepieces. Most Dobsonian telescopes have enough friction in the bearings to resist a moderate amount of imbalance; however, this friction can also make it difficult to position the telescope accurately. To correct such imbalance, counterweights are sometimes hooked or bolted onto the back of the mirror box.

== Derivative designs ==
From its inception, telescope makers have been modifying the Dobsonian design to fit their needs. The original design fit the needs and available supplies of one person—John Dobson. Other people devised variants that fit their own needs, abilities, and access to parts. This has led to significant diversity in &quot;Dobsonian&quot; design.

===Collapsible tube assemblies===
&quot;Classic&quot; design tube assemblies would require a large van for transport. Designers started coming up with disassembleable or collapsible variants that could be brought to the site with a small SUV, hatchback, or even a sedan. This innovation allowed the amateur astronomy community access to even larger apertures.

====The truss tube====
Many designs have combined the advantages of a light truss tube and a collapsible design. Collapsible &quot;truss tube&quot; Dobsonians appeared in the amateur telescope making community as early as 1982 and allow the optical tube assembly, the largest component, to be broken down. As the name implies, the &quot;tube&quot; of this design is actually composed of an upper cage assembly, which contains the secondary mirror, and focuser, held in place by several rigid poles over a mirror box which contains the objective mirror. The poles are held in place by quick-disconnecting clamps which allow the entire telescope to be easily broken down into its smaller components, facilitating their transport by vehicle or other means to an observing site. These truss tube designs are sometimes incorrectly called a &quot;Serrurier truss&quot;, but since the main truss is not built with an opposing mirror cell truss it only performs one function of that design, i.e. keeping the optics parallel.

===Modifications to the altazimuth mount (rocker box)===

The main attribute of a Dobsonian&#x27;s mount is that it resembles a &quot;gun carriage&quot; configuration with a &quot;rocker box&quot; consisting of a horizontal trunnion style altitude axis and a broadly supported azimuth axis, both making use of material such as plastic, Formica, and Teflon to achieve smooth operation. Many derivative mount designs have kept this basic form while heavily modifying the materials and configuration.

====Compact &quot;rocker box&quot; mounts====
Many designs have increased portability by shrinking the altazimuth (rocker box) mount down to a small rotating platform. The altitude trunnion style bearing in these designs becomes a large radius roughly equal to or greater than the radius of the objective mirror, attached to or integrated into the tube assembly which lowers the overall profile of the mount. The advantage of this is that it reduces the total telescope weight, and the telescope&#x27;s balance becomes less sensitive to changes in the weight loading of telescope tube from the use of heavier eyepieces or the addition of cameras etc.

====Overcoming the limitations of the altazimuth mount====
Since the late 1990s many innovations in mount design and electronics by amateur telescope makers and commercial manufacturers have allowed users to overcome some of the limitations of the Dobsonian style altazimuth mount.

* Digital setting circles: The invention of microprocessor-based digital setting circles has allowed any altazimuth mounted telescope to be fitted or retrofitted with the ability to accurately display the coordinates of the telescope direction. These systems not only give the user a digital read-out for right ascension (RA) and declination (dec.), they also interface with digital devices such as laptop computers, tablet computers, and smartphones using live ephemeris calculating / charting planetarium software to give a current graphical representation of where the telescope is pointing, allowing the user to quickly find an object.
* Equatorial platform: The use of equatorial platforms (such as the Poncet Platform) fitted under the altazimuth mount has given users limited equatorial tracking for visual and astrophotographic work. Such platforms can incorporate a clock drive for ease of tracking, and with careful polar alignment sub-arc second precision CCD imaging is entirely possible. Roeser Observatory, Luxembourg (MPC observatory code 163) have contributed hundreds of astrometric measurements to the Minor Planet Center using a home-built 20&quot; dobsonian on an equatorial platform.

==Commercial adaptations==

The original intent of the Dobsonian design was to provide an affordable, simple, and rugged large-aperture instrument at low cost. These same attributes facilitate their mass production. One of the first companies to offer Dobsonian telescopes commercially was the now defunct company Coulter Optical (now part of Murnaghan Instruments). In the 1980s, they helped popularize the design with &quot;Odyssey&quot; models of various sizes, with tubes made of Sonotube and following Dobson&#x27;s original concept of simplicity.
By the 1990s, Meade Instruments, Orion Telescopes and other manufacturers began to introduce upgraded Dobsonian models. These imported mass-produced scopes included such niceties as metal tubes and more refined hardware, and are still very affordable.

Since the 1990s, manufactured Dobsonians using the truss tube design have become increasingly popular. The first commercial truss Dobsonian was released into the market by Obsession Telescopes in 1989. Later American manufacturers included StarStructure, Webster Telescopes, AstroSystems, Teeter&#x27;s Telescopes, Hubble Optics, Waite Research, and New Moon Telescopes. These low-volume builders offer premium objective mirrors, high-end materials and custom craftmanship, as well as optional computer controlled GoTo systems. Some also produce &quot;ultra-light&quot; models that offer greater portability.

In the 21st century, truss Dobsonian models are also mass-produced by Meade, Orion, Explore Scientific and others. Mostly manufactured in China, they offer good quality and value while being considerably less expensive than the premium scopes described above. In 2017, Sky-Watcher introduced its line of large Stargate models.

Solid tube commercial Dobsonians typically have a maximum aperture of 12 inches (305 mm) due to the size of the tube. Truss Dobsonians of 12 to 18 inches (305 to 457 mm) are the most popular sizes, as they offer substantial aperture yet can still be easily set up by one person. Several manufacturers offer models of 24 inch (610 mm) aperture and greater. Truss Dobsonians are the largest telescopes commercially available today. A massive 36 inch (914 mm) aperture Hybrid model from New Moon Telescopes was displayed at the 2018 Northeast Astronomy Forum. In 2019, a huge 50 inch (1270 mm) aperture folded Newtonian from Canadian based Optiques Fullum was installed in New Jersey.

==The Dobsonian&#x27;s effect on amateur astronomy==
The Dobsonian design is considered revolutionary due to the sheer size of telescopes it made available to amateur astronomers. The inherent simplicity and large aperture of the design began to attract interest through the 1970s since it offered the advantage of inexpensive large instruments that could be carried to dark sky locations and star parties in the back of a small car and set up in minutes.

The result has been a proliferation of larger telescopes which would have been expensive to build or buy, and unwieldy to operate, using &quot;traditional&quot; construction methods. Whereas an 8 inch Newtonian telescope would have been considered large in the 1970s, today 16 inch systems are common, and huge 32 inch systems not all that rare.

In combination with other improvements in observing equipment, such as narrow-pass optical filters, improved eyepieces, and digital visible and infrared photography, the large apertures of the Dobsonian have dramatically increased the number of objects observed as well as the amount of detail in each object observed. Whereas the amateur astronomer of the 1970s and 1980s typically did not explore much beyond the Messier and brighter NGC objects, thanks in part to Dobsonians, modern amateur astronomers routinely observe dim objects listed in obscure catalogues, such as the IC, Abell, Kohoutek, Minkowski, and others once considered reference works only for professional astronomers.

When mounted on an equatorial platform the difficulties using a Dobsonian for short-exposure (≲ 1 hr) astrophotography are obviated. This has opened up the field of high precision asteroid astrometry (and discovery) to the amateur wishing to contribute minor planet positions to the Minor Planet Center. It also makes possible searches for new, faint objects such as novae / supernovae in local galaxies, and comets (for reports to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams).

<text>Left Shift () was a Trotskyist group in Germany, which was the German affiliate of the International Socialist Tendency (the network founded by the British Socialist Workers Party). In September 2007, Linksruck formally dissolved, and its members regrouped into the Left Party as Marx21 – Network for International Socialism.

== History ==

Linksruck&#x27;s origins lie in the Socialist Workers&#x27; Group (, SAG), which was founded in the 1970s by West German supporters of the British &quot;International Socialists&quot; (IS), precursor to the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). One of the founders of the SAG was Volkhard Mosler, who had been in contact with Tony Cliff since 1966. Initially based in Frankfurt, the SAG gradually developed a national structure but remained a relatively small organization. Like their British counterparts, the SAG sought to build a radical rank-and-file workers&#x27; movement to oppose moderate trade-union leaders.

After German reunification in 1990, the SAG participated in the emerging Antifa movement against the far right. In the early 1990s young members of the SAG joined Jusos, the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s youth group, hoping to push its members to the left. After a short time began publishing the paper &quot;Linksruck&quot;, and by the end of 1993 the organization referred to itself by this name.

Dissidents in the group led by Norbert Nelte, critical of Linksruck&#x27;s entryist tactics and the &quot;lack of theoretical training for new members&quot;, broke off and formed the International Socialists () in Cologne in 1992.

In the 1990s, Linksruck shifted away from the SPD youth and became involved with the growing antiglobalization movement, and later the anti-Iraq War movement. Through participation in these decentralized movements, Linksruck gained many new members. As the group made a transition from the antiglobalization movement to the anti-war movement, its most strident antiglobalization activists split off to form the (commonly referred to as the ).

When left-wing dissidents split from the Social Democrats in 2005 to form the WASG, Linksruck members entered the new organization. Linksruck member Christine Buchholz served on the WASG&#x27;s National Committee. Other members also took stood as WASG candidates in local and federal elections.

Over the course of 2007, Linksruck leaders sought to relaunch their group (in preparation for the merger of the WASG with the Party of Democratic Socialism, which would form the Left Party). In April 2007, an organizational meeting voted to dissolve the organization. In May 2007, the magazine &quot;Linksruck&quot; was replaced by a new publication, &quot;marx21&quot;. In early September 2007 (three months after the formation of the Left Party), a founding congress ended Linksruck and launched the new &quot;Marx21: Network for International Socialism&quot;. Marx21 aims at being &quot;a network for Marxists within the new Left Party&quot; and is a component of the party&#x27;s Socialist Left caucus.

In the 2008 state elections in Hesse, Linksruck/Marx21 activist Janine Wissler was elected to the state parliament.

Christine Buchholz is now a member of the Left Party&#x27;s National Committee. In 2009, Buchholz became a member of the German Bundestag.

<text>Elmira is the largest community in the township of Woolwich, Ontario, Canada. It is north of the city of Waterloo near the Regional Municipality of Waterloo&#x27;s northern border with Wellington County. The community was listed in the 2016 Canadian census as having a population of 10,161.

Waterloo Region is home to the largest population of Old Order Mennonites in Canada, particularly around St Jacobs and Elmira. They are often seen on the local roads using traditional horse and buggy transportation; many also use horses to pull the implements in their farm fields.

==History==
The land comprising Woolwich Township belonged to the Huron Nation, then to the Mohawk Nation. The first European settlers arrived in Woolwich Township in the late 18th century. In 1798, William Wallace was one of the first settlers after he was deeded of land on the Grand River for $16,364. A block three of First Nations Lands, this area now comprises a large part of Woolwich Township. The parcel of land called &quot;Woolwich&quot; was named after Woolwich in England. The early settlers were primarily from England or Ireland until about 1830.

In 1806, Wallace sold the major portion of his tract to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch (actually Deitsch or German). The buyers were Augustus Jones and brothers John and Jacob Erb, trustees for the German Company, who were among the first settlers from Pennsylvania. Wallace sold of land to the German Company at $1.00 an acre.

The village was settled in 1832 by Henry Christman and Edward Bristow. In 1834, Edward Bristow from Sussex, England became one of Elmira&#x27;s first European settlers when he purchased of land at this location for 50 cents per acre. He started the first store, tavern and potashery. A community by the name of Bristow&#x27;s Corners was already in existence in 1839 when a post office was assigned there. Local merchant Samuel Weber had been visiting New York State in the early 1850s and was apparently impressed with Elmira, New York. This may have been a factor in the decision of Woolwich Township council on February 22, 1853, to rename the community Elmira.

The post office opened in 1850. A historic property, Bristow&#x27;s Inn was just land when it was sold by Edward Bristow to Jacob W. Bowman who first built a farmhouse there in 1860 (now 80 Arthur Street South, Elmira). In 1989 the structure was restored to its original appearance and became the Country Inn. Afterwards, the building was recognized under the Ontario Heritage Act.

As in the nearby townships, Mennonites formed a significant proportion of the population. 
In addition to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, the majority of settlers were from Germany by the 1850s. Families living in Elmira in that era included Oswald, Esch, Steffler, Dreisinger, Braun and Schedewitz. Many were Lutherans. By 1852 the St. James Lutheran Church had been built and was in operation.

The stores and tradesmen served farmers who lived in the surrounding area. The population in 1869 was about 450, increasing to about 1,069 by 1891. Major events that attracted people from outside the village included the Woolwich Agricultural Fair (since 1854) and the Elmira Maple Syrup Festival (since 1965) which is still held every year.

In 1861, the Elmira House (a large store) was erected as numerous artisans and merchants came to Elmira to earn a living. As a result, Elmira became known as an &#x27;enterprising&#x27; community. In December 1886, Elmira entered a new chapter of its history with the incorporation of the settlement as a village by charter. At this date, the population of the newly incorporated village was 760 people. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, Elmira acquired a brass band (1873) and a library (1886, Elmira Mechanics&#x27; Institute) with an initial membership of 20 people. In 1913, a large Carnegie Library was built with grant money from American industrialist Andrew Carnegie.

By 1864, the village had a large tannery, a lumber mill, and three churches, two German
Lutheran and one Wesleyan Methodist and an elementary school. The population was 400. The railway arrived in the late 1800s, both the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific. After this method of transportation became available, furniture manufacturing and other industries began to open.

In the early 1900s, North Waterloo County - the Kitchener, Waterloo, St. Jacobs, Elmira area - exhibited a strong German culture and those of German origin made up a third of the population in 1911. Lutherans were the primary religious group. There were nearly three times as many Lutherans as Mennonites by that time. The latter primarily resided in the rural areas and small communities.
In 1908, the first cinema opened in Elmira. The Theatorium initially ran silent movies with music provided by a pianist. The Bandstand was built in 1912 by A.M. Bowman from a design prepared by members of the Elmira Musical Society. Located in Gore Park, it is a reminder of the centre of entertainment in a small town in the early 20th century. A brick post office opened in 1914 and its tower contained the town clock.

The village was incorporated as a town in 1923, within Waterloo County. At that time, the population was 2500.

In 1973, the town of Elmira ceased to exist under the amalgamation that also formed the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, replacing Waterloo County. Elmira became the administrative centre of Woolwich Township which increased in size at that time.

During the 1960s under contract with the U.S. government, Elmira&#x27;s Uniroyal chemical plant (which changed its name to Crompton Company in 2001 and then to Chemtura in 2006) was one of seven manufacturers supplying the U.S. military with the toxic herbicide Agent Orange.

Due to the poor disposal practices of the toxic waste associated with the manufacture of Agent Orange and other chemicals, contamination has seeped down to the aquifer in and around Elmira. This contamination, NDMA (N-Nitrosodimethylamine), forced local water wells to close in 1990. Water is now delivered via a pipeline from Waterloo and other near local areas.

==Local information==

The local schools include John Mahood Public School, Riverside Public School, St. Teresa RC, Park Manor Senior Public School, and Elmira District Secondary School. The secondary school draws students from the town and surrounding areas of St. Jacobs, Conestogo, Drayton, Winterbourne, Linwood, Heidelberg, West Montrose, Wallenstein, Yatton, Dorking and St. Clements.

The Elmira Library is a branch within the Region of Waterloo Library system. In 1911, the Elmira Library received a Carnegie grant after being supported by the local businesses for many years. It was expanded in 1978 to include a children&#x27;s library and a meeting room. In 2008, an elevator was added to make the library accessible. In addition to WIFI, there are five public use internet stations in the library. Various programs are offered throughout the year, including children&#x27;s programs.

==Woolwich Memorial Centre==
The Woolwich Memorial Centre (WMC) is the Township of Woolwich&#x27;s newest state-of-the-art facility comprising two NHL-sized ice surfaces, two pools, a fitness centre and walking track. The facility also includes a community centre, seniors centre, youth centre, Concourse Cafe, two meeting rooms and offices for minor sports teams.

==Economy==
Elmira is the industrial centre of Woolwich Township. Major employers include Trylon TSF, Sanyo Machine Works, Elmira Pet Products, Lanxess, Toyota Boshoku formerly Trim Masters, Engineered Lifting Systems, and Southfield Windows &amp; Doors. Since the 1970s, tourism has become an increasingly important industry in Elmira.

==Sports==

The local Jr. B Hockey team is the Elmira Sugar Kings, named after the very successful Elmira Maple Syrup Festival. Woolwich Township, where Elmira is located, was selected as a Top 5 finalist for the 2009 Kraft Hockeyville contest. Their 3rd-place finish earned them $25,000 in arena upgrades from Kraft Foods. The eventual winner was Terrace, British Columbia, which received an NHL preseason game, $100,000 for arena upgrades, and broadcast of CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

Elmira has an active lawn bowling club. The Elmira Lawn Bowling Club is a member of District 7 of the Ontario Lawn Bowling Association.

==Transportation==

Old Order Mennonites in buggies are a regular sight around the town.

Grand River Transit bus service was introduced to the town in April 2009 when the existing Route 21 to St. Jacobs, originating from Conestoga Mall in North Waterloo, was extended to Elmira. The days of service of the route were also increased from two days a week to six.

In 2018, Kiwanis Transit launched a free shuttle bus service throughout the town, designed as a feeder service to connect to the GRT Route 21. This six-month pilot service was extended for another six months, and in September 2019 regional transit planners proposed that it be transformed into a permanent Grand River Transit route.

The Waterloo Central Railway&#x27;s tourist train also serves the town.

Elmira is an entry point for the Kissing Bridge Trailway, which runs between Guelph and Millbank. The Kissing Bridge Trailway is maintained by local community groups including the Elmira Lions Club, and is part of the larger G2G Rail Trail which stretches along the route of the former Guelph and Goderich Railway. It passes through a number of other small communities including Ariss, West Montrose, Wallenstein, and Linwood. The trail has a stone chip surface and is advertised as suitable for walking, cycling, running, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing.

==Maple Syrup Festival==
Each spring, since 1965, tens of thousands of people have gathered in Elmira, Ontario to celebrate the return of spring and maple syrup. Elmira Maple Syrup Festival is widely regarded as the World&#x27;s largest Maple Syrup festival. In 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records designated the event as the largest single-day maple syrup festival in the world. A family event, the festival features: sugar bush tours; a half-mile long outdoor mall with vendors of local speciality food and crafts; a craft show; the Mayor&#x27;s Maple Syrup contest; and of course the star of the day, pancakes and golden maple syrup.

Started as a way to promote the sticky spring delicacy, the syrup festival has always brought together volunteers from all parts of the community. The proceeds of their efforts go to support local charitable organizations.

<doc id="421529" wikidata="Q332746" url="?curid=421529" title="Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn">
<text>Michael Edward Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn, (23 October 1837 – 30 April 1916), known as Sir Michael Hicks Beach, Bt, from 1854 to 1906 and subsequently as The Viscount St Aldwyn to 1915, was a British Conservative politician. Known as &quot;Black Michael&quot;, he was notably Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1885 to 1886 and again from 1895 to 1902 and also led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1886. Due to the length of his service, he was Father of the House from 1901 to 1906, when he took his peerage.

==Background and education==
Born at Portugal Street in London, Hicks Beach was the son of Sir Michael Hicks Beach, 8th Baronet, of Beverston, and his wife Harriett Vittoria, second daughter of John Stratton. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a first class degree in the School of Law and Modern History in 1858. In 1854 he succeeded his father as ninth Baronet.

==Political career, 1864–1888==
In 1864 he was returned to Parliament as a Conservative for East Gloucestershire. During 1868 he acted both as Parliamentary Secretary to the Poor Law Board and as Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs. In 1874 he was made Chief Secretary for Ireland, and was included in the Cabinet in 1877. From 1878 to 1880 he was Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1885 he was elected for Bristol West, and became Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. After Gladstone&#x27;s brief Home Rule Ministry in 1886 Hicks Beach entered Lord Salisbury&#x27;s next Cabinet again as Irish Secretary, making way for Lord Randolph Churchill as Leader of the House; but troubles with his eyesight compelled him to resign in 1887.

==Political career, 1888–1902==
From 1888 to 1892 Hicks Beach returned to active work as President of the Board of Trade, and in 1895, Goschen being transferred to the Admiralty, he again became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1899 he lowered the fixed charge for the National Debt from twenty-five to twenty-three million, a reduction imperatively required, apart from other reasons, by the difficulties found in redeeming Consols at their then inflated price. When compelled to find means for financing the war in South Africa, he insisted on combining the raising of loans with the imposition of fresh taxation; and besides raising the income-tax each year, he introduced taxes on sugar and exported coal (1901), and in 1902 reimposed the registration duty on corn and flour which had been abolished in 1869 by Lowe. The sale of his Netheravon estates in Wiltshire to the War Office in 1898 occasioned some acrid criticism concerning the valuation, for which, however, Sir Michael himself was not responsible. On Lord Salisbury&#x27;s retirement in August 1902 Hicks Beach also left the government.

Following his resignation, Sir Michael and Lady Lucy Hicks Beach, with their family, visited Egypt in late 1902.

==Other public appointments==

He accepted the chairmanship of the Royal Commission on Ritualistic Practices in the Church, and he did valuable work as an arbitrator; and though when the fiscal controversy arose he became the first president of the Unionist Free Food League, his parliamentary loyalty to Balfour did much to prevent the Unionist free-traders from precipitating a rupture. Hicks-Beach was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Gloucestershire in 1861. In 1906 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount St Aldwyn, of Coln St Aldwyn, in the County of Gloucester, and in 1915 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Quenington, of Quenington, in the County of Gloucester, and Earl St Aldwyn, of Coln St Aldwyn, in the County of Gloucester.

==Family==

Lord St Aldwyn married firstly (6.1.1864, South Molton, Devon), Caroline Susan Elwes (3 Prior Buildings, Cheltenham 4 April 1845 – 41 Portman Square, Marylebone 14 August 1865), daughter of John Henry Elwes by Mary Bromley, sister of Henry John Elwes, and secondly Lady Lucy Catherine Fortescue, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue, in 1874. They had one son, Viscount Quenington, also a politician, and three daughters.

His second daughter, Susan Hicks Beach (1878-1965), was the sitter representing Britannia on the reverse of the Edward VII silver florins (two shilling pieces) issued from 1902 to 1910 and designed by George William de Saulles. She resided with her mother for sundry years subsequent to World War II, cultivating and caring for the family land in the Cotswolds.

Lord St Aldwyn died in April 1916, aged 78, only a week after his son was killed in action in the First World War, and was succeeded in his titles by his grandson Michael, who also became a Conservative politician. Lucy, The Countess St Aldwyn had been involved with Elizabeth Malleson in the creating of a Rural Nursing Association in the 1880s. This organisation was successful and incorporated in similar initiatives by Queen Victoria. The countess died in March 1940. The coastal town of Beachport in the Australian state of South Australia was named after Lord St Aldwyn in 1878.

<text>The Slime series is a spinoff series of games from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; featuring its Slime character. Three games have been released, the second of which, &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&quot;, has been released in North America.

The series features top down adventure gameplay mixed with tank combat in the latter two titles. The plot follows Rocket, who must set out on journeys to defend his kingdom and its people from the Tails Brigade.

The series has met with positive critical reception, and despite its simplicity has been praised for its gameplay mechanics and graphic design, though sales have been mixed.

==Development==
Yoshiki Watabe, producer of &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;, thought of the idea and approached series creator Yuji Horii and together they brainstormed the games genre and style. Previously the two had discussed making a game for children while working on a port of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; to the Game Boy, and the need for a main character appealing to children. When first conceived, the game had the blue slime protagonist wielding a sword and shield, and a gameplay test was done in this style, but was rejected because developers felt &quot;This isn&#x27;t really a slime game, this is like a blue Link&quot;. Developers then started over and asked what a slime could do that a normal character couldn&#x27;t, from which the idea of the player stretching and launching the slime at enemies and objects came from. The developers also chose to keep humans out of the game, due to that if they did appear, they would probably just run around killing all the Slimes.

When the second game was localized for the American audience, there was concern about the slime&#x27;s identifiability with the public, and so &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was added to the title. Watabe wanted to make sure that &quot;Rocket Slime&quot; used both screens for gameplay, unlike most other DS titles that just used it for menus, believing that the duel screens was the consoles &quot;focus&quot;. Early in the title&#x27;s life, the developers had a version of it that uses the touch screen to use Rocket&#x27;s Elasto Blast technique, but scrapped the idea, due to it being too hard to control. In a search for what to do with the Nintendo DS&#x27;s two screens, the developers arrived at the idea of a tank battle, and a duel view allowing players to see inside and outside the tank at once. Each character name was approved during localization by Square Enix, and names involving American cultural references had to be explained in Japanese, a task that saw many jokes cut and replaced.

Watabe said that if &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes&quot; sold well, that the developer would look into a sequel, and they may also include Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support. In February 2011, Yuji Horii stated in an interview that a sequel was &quot;a possibility&quot;. On March 16, 2011 a third installment in the series was announced featuring stereoscopic 3D and customizable pirate ships for combat.
==Games==
==Common elements==

The blue slime is a monster from the Japanese &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; video game series. The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series includes over 20 types of slimes, the majority of which are present in these games. As the player rescues other slimes, more areas of the world are opened up.

Attacking enemies is done by stretching the slime and then releasing, flinging it forward. The player can also hover temporarily in the air, and bury themselves in the ground while still moving. Starting in the second title, players also engaged in battles using large tanks.

The player can also carry enemies or other slimes on his head. Enemies, of which he can carry up to three, can be thrown as an attack, while friends are required to be carried to a conveyance back home in order to count as rescued. These modes of transportation include rail carts, airships, and balloons. Occasionally slimes in the village will give quests to the player, which require them to carry enemies or items to these transport points. Picking up a certain enemy, the swordsman, allows the player to perform a sword attack which is faster than the standard stretch attack. If the player is hit by an enemy, everything they are carrying is dropped.

The slime can die if attacked too many times by enemies, as well as if the player takes too long to complete a dungeon, as in the game night falls and they are kidnapped by the Tails brigade like the rest of their village.

The plot of the games has involved the protagonist blue slime Rocket trying to retrieve something of value that has been stolen. In the first two titles he saves his family, friends and countrymen that were kidnapped by a group of monsters known as the Tails Brigade, or the Plob in the English version. The third title has Rocket traveling across the world to find seven stolen treasures.
==Reception==

===Sales===
The first game in the series sold 237,652 copies as of December 14, 2003 and was the 53rd best selling game of 2003 in Japan. Its sequel, &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&quot;, was released in Japan in 2005 and in North America in 2006. A third game in the series called &quot;Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3&quot; was released in November 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS, selling 38,859 copies its first week and charting at number seven.

===Reception===
The &quot;Slime&quot; series has been well received both in Japan and internationally. &quot;Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest&quot; was the runner up for IGNs best Japanese exclusive game of 2003. Famitsu gave &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&quot; a 34/40, grading it a 10, 8, 8, 8. It was also chosen as the number four best Nintendo DS game of 2006 by GameSpy, calling it an &quot;engrossing&quot; RPG and enjoyable tank battles. IGN named the game the Nintendo DS game of the month for September 2006. &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded &quot;Slime Morimori Dragon Quest 3&quot; a 37/40.

<text>Sir Denys Louis Lasdun, CH, CBE, RA (8 September 1914, Kensington, London – 11 January 2001, Fulham, London) was an eminent English architect, the son of Nathan Lasdun (1879–1920) and Julie (&quot;née&quot; Abrahams; 1884–1963). Probably his best known work is the Royal National Theatre, on London&#x27;s South Bank of the Thames, which is a Grade II* listed building and one of the most notable examples of Brutalist design in the United Kingdom.

Lasdun studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, and was a junior in the practice of Wells Coates. Like other Modernist architects, including Sir Basil Spence and Peter and Alison Smithson, Lasdun was much influenced by Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, but there was a gentler, more classical influence, too, from the likes of Nicholas Hawksmoor. Lasdun was elected a Royal Academician on 29 May 1991.

==Family==
Lasdun&#x27;s grandfather, the Australia-based tobacconist Louis Abrahams (1852–1903), was an important patron of Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton and other artists associated with the Heidelberg School art movement, also known as Australian Impressionism. His art collection was passed down to Lasdun. His mother Julie Lasdun was a pianist who accompanied the Hungarian violinist Adila Fachiri. In 1930 she played in the first chamber performance of Constant Lambert&#x27;s &quot;The Rio Grande&quot;, alongside Arthur Benjamin. The Royal College of Music commemorated her through the Julie Lasdun Prize.

Lasdun married Susan Bendit in 1954 and there were two sons and a daughter. One is the author James Lasdun.

==Early work==
Before and after Second World War service in the army, Lasdun worked for a while with Berthold Lubetkin&#x27;s Tecton practice, becoming a partner. During this period he also completed one private house in Paddington, in Le Corbusier&#x27;s style. After the war, Lasdun worked with Lindsay Drake on the Hallfield Estate, which had been planned by Lubetkin and Tecton in a similar patterned, tightly planned idiom to his Spa Green and Priory Green Estates. Lasdun&#x27;s Hallfield School was the first clue to his mature style, in its use of bare concrete and angularity, as well as its more human scale.

In the 1950s he was a partner with Jane Drew, Maxwell Fry and Lindsay Drake in Fry, Drew, Drake and Lasdun. His originality became more evident in his &#x27;cluster blocks&#x27; in Bethnal Green. These were a response to the critique of much post-war development for creating an isolating environment and discouraging community. The cluster blocks grouped flats around a central tower, and tenants were intended to be able to pick out their own flats in the structure. The earlier blocks at Usk Street of 1954 were medium-sized, while the later block Keeling House is high-rise. In the late 1980s Keeling House was slated for demolition by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, who had found it difficult to manage; following a pre-emptive listing was sold to a private developer for conversion to privately owned flats, and the Lasdun adjacent low-rise slab blocks of social housing were removed at the same time. Lasdun made an excursion into luxury housing with his St James&#x27; Place flats in 1958, the plan of which was partly derived from social housing models such as the Narkomfin Building.

Lasdun completed what may be regarded as his breakthrough masterwork in the Royal College of Physicians building in Regent&#x27;s Park (1964). Inserted into a nationally important Nash set-piece terrace of neoclassical form, the RCP projects a raised linear form perpendicular to the terrace to create a series of gardens and spaces around the building, with annexes for lecture hall and an historic timber panelled room preserved from the earlier Colleges. Using modern reinforced concrete technology and highly expressive structural methods, the volumes are made to &#x27;float in space&#x27; on the slimmest of supports to dissolve spatial boundaries between inside and out. The work makes implicit references to the work of the &#x27;high modernists&#x27; from le Corbusier and Mies to the &#x27;Scandinavian modernism&#x27; of Aalto, Asplund and Jacobsen as well as the contemporary Brutalist aesthetics of the era, yet developing a personal idiom of opened cantilevered volumes, long perspectives, triangulated form, and clarity of concept and structure that is entirely Lasdun&#x27;s own. This building, however, is finished in luxurious white Sicilian marble, Murano glass mosaic tiles, polished brass and black engineering brick, and was one of the first post-War buildings to be awarded Grade I listing for national and international significance and influence on the work of others.

==University buildings==
Elements of Lasdun&#x27;s most famous style, which combined cubic towers, bare concrete and jutting foyers, which was compared by some to Frank Lloyd Wright, can be found in his first educational buildings, the Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge and the Royal College of Physicians in Regent&#x27;s Park, the latter of which compared favourably to the surrounding buildings by John Nash. More extensive was his design for the University of East Anglia. This consisted of a series of classrooms and laboratories connected by walkways, and glazed residential quarters shaped like ziggurats. Following this acclaimed design Lasdun designed two buildings for the University of London, one for SOAS (1970) and another for the Institute of Education (1970–1976) (now a part of UCL), which was particularly controversial by its insertion into the previous street plan of squares and terraces, which Lasdun claimed to respect though in a more Brutalist language. The expressed fire escape staircases make references to Wells Coates and Louis Kahn and Lasdun&#x27;s masterplanning created a new semi-public square over car parking. The building is now listed Grade II*.

==Late work==
The most celebrated of the architect&#x27;s work is his Royal National Theatre on London&#x27;s South Bank. King Charles compared it to a nuclear power station but it was popular with other traditionalists, with John Betjeman writing Lasdun a letter in praise of its design. Lasdun (or his firm Lasdun, Softley and Partners) designed the neighbouring IBM headquarters (finished 1985) as a low-rise setting for the theatre. His European Investment Bank in Luxembourg deployed a similar layered low-rise design approach. The last works produced by the firm were an office block, Milton Gate, Chiswell Street, London clad in green-tinted glazing and 10 Fenchurch Street, London clad in aluminium; Lasdun&#x27;s design involvement with these was very slight.

Lasdun was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1977. His drawings and papers are available for consultation at the RIBA Drawings &amp; Archives Collections. Despite the controversy of much of his work, most of Lasdun&#x27;s surviving buildings are listed, although his 1958 Peter Robinson department store on London&#x27;s Strand was demolished in the 1990s.

Lasdun died on 11 January 2001 aged 86.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/9) with Denys Lasdun in 1996-97 for its Architects Lives&#x27; collection held by the British Library.

<doc id="421553" wikidata="Q5046569" url="?curid=421553" title="Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn">
<text>Carroll Gardens is a neighborhood in the northwestern portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Encompassing approximately 40 city blocks, it is bounded by Degraw and Warren Streets (north), Hoyt and Smith Streets (east), Ninth Street or the Gowanus Expressway (south), and Interstate 278, the Gowanus and Brooklyn–Queens Expressways (west). The neighborhoods that surround it are Cobble Hill to the northwest, Boerum Hill to the northeast, Gowanus to the east, Red Hook to the south and southwest, and the Columbia Street Waterfront District to the west.

Originally considered to be part of the area once known as South Brooklyn (or, more specifically, Red Hook), the area started to have its own identity in the 1960s. The neighborhood was named after Charles Carroll, the only Roman Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence, and whose name was already attached to Carroll Street and Carroll Park. The name also reflects the large front gardens of brownstones in the Carroll Gardens Historic District and elsewhere in the neighborhood. Despite having an Irish surname, in recent times it has been known as an Italian American neighborhood.

Carroll Gardens is part of Brooklyn Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Code is 11231. It is patrolled by the 76th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. and is served by the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine Company 239, Engine Co. 279/Ladder Co. 131 and Engine Company 202/Ladder Company 101. Politically, Carroll Gardens is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 39th District.

== History ==
===19th century===
Carroll Gardens was settled in the 19th century by immigrants from Ireland, followed in the middle of the century by Norwegian immigrants, who founded two churches, the Norwegian Seaman&#x27;s Church (formerly the Westminster Presbyterian Church), now apartments, and the Norwegian Methodist Episcopal Church (formerly the Carroll Park Methodist Episcopal Church, no longer extant).

The development of the South Brooklyn area, including Carroll Gardens, was aided by the foundation in 1846 by philanthropists Henry Pierrepont and Jacob E. Leroy of the Hamilton Avenue Ferry. Its purpose was to improve transportation to the newly created Green-Wood Cemetery, but horse car service, and later trolley lines, connecting to the ferry ran through Carroll Gardens, enabling businessmen who lived there to commute more easily to work in Manhattan.

In the late 1840s, Carroll Park, Brooklyn&#x27;s third-oldest, a block-long area of playgrounds, walkways, and sitting areas between Court, Smith, Carroll, and President Streets was built. Originally a private garden, it was purchased by the city in 1853, and was named after Charles Carroll in honor of his Maryland regiment, which had helped to defend the area during the Battle of Long Island in the American Revolutionary War.

In 1846, surveyor Richard Butt planned gardens in front of the brownstone houses in the oldest section of the neighborhood when he developed it. The homes are set farther back from the street than is common in Brooklyn, and the large gardens became an iconic depiction of the neighborhood. The same year, a law was passed requiring that all buildings between Henry Street and Smith Street have between the building and the street for &quot;courtyards&quot;. The large gardens can be seen from First to Fourth Place between Henry and Smith Streets, as well as on President, Carroll, and Second Streets between Smith and Hoyt Streets.

Further development of the Carroll Gardens was aided by the draining in the late 1860s of the swampland which surrounded Gowanus Creek through the deepening and dredging of the Creek to create the Gowanus Canal. This provoked land speculation and a building boom throughout the area. It was during this period, from the late 1860s to the early 1880s, that the area which is now the Carroll Gardens Historic District began to be developed.

===20th century===
Italian immigrants began coming to the neighborhood in the late 19th century – dock workers and workers in the Brooklyn Navy Yard – continuing through the 1950s, which led to much of the Irish population of the area leaving beginning in the 1920s. The rise of the Italian population provoked questions about the role of the Mafia in the neighborhood. One theory has it that Carroll Gardens, which lies between a territory traditionally controlled by the Gambino crime family and one controlled by the Colombo family, is considered to be neutral territory, and has been, for the most part, left alone.

Carroll Gardens had long been considered to be part of either the larger area referred to as South Brooklyn, or the neighborhood known as Red Hook. That neighborhood had an informal division in the 1930s and 1940s along Hamilton Avenue, with kids from south of the avenue, mostly of Italian descent, calling themselves &quot;Hookers&quot; or &quot;Hookies&quot; after Red Hook, and kids north of the street, mostly Irish, in what would now be Carroll Gardens called &quot;Creekers&quot; or &quot;Creekies&quot; after the now-drained Gowanus Creek. Violence between the two groups was common. The division between the neighborhoods became even stronger beginning in the late 1940s when Robert Moses built the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Gowanus Expressway, which started the process of the Carroll Gardens area taking on a separate and distinct character of its own; the neighborhood&#x27;s name came from the Carroll Gardens Association, which had been created to advocate for neighborhood improvements.

In the 1960s, young middle-class professionals began to be attracted to the Carroll Garden area due to its convenience to Manhattan, where many of them worked, and its growing reputation as a safe and quiet place to live. This began the gentrification of the neighborhood, and a response from older residents, who did not appreciate these &quot;hippie&quot; newcomers who had no ties to the community. Regardless, the neighborhood gradually received its own name at that time, and the Carroll Gardens Association was formed in 1964. One result was that the decades-long control of the area by a political machine was ended.

Today, Carroll Gardens is predominantly upper middle-class, while Red Hook, which had retained its working-class, waterfront ambiance, has only recently begun to feel the effects of gentrification. However, the two neighborhoods have historically both been working-class and a mix of working-class Italian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American residents, as well as more recent Arab-American immigrant families. As late as the 1990s, several highly publicized incidents of violence underscored the tension between working-class African-Americans from Red Hook and working-class Italian-American residents of Carroll Gardens.

===21st century===
Carroll Gardens is still largely known as an Italian-American neighborhood, but the Italian population has decreased in recent years from 52 percent of the population in 1980 to 22 percent in 2012. Still, despite the decline in the Italian segment of the population and the effects of gentrification, the neighborhood remains a strongly Italian one. Italians in the neighborhood often play bocce games, speak several dialects of Italian, and operate many Italian restaurants and shops, as well as join fraternal and benevolent associations attached to specific towns in Italy. The Roman Catholicism of the Italian population is still evident in the many shrines, especially to the Virgin Mary, which can be seen in front gardens in the neighborhood, and the 70-year tradition of an Our Lady of Sorrows procession celebrating Good Friday continues. Adult children who had moved away from Carroll Gardens have started returning to the neighborhood to raise their children. 

The area has seen an increase in French immigrants starting in the 21st century. Carroll Gardens and the surrounding neighborhoods are sometimes referred to as &quot;Little France&quot; or &quot;Little Paris&quot; due to the growing French population. Bastille Day celebrations are held on July 14 of each year. International School of Brooklyn, a Nursery-8th grade independent school, offers a French and Spanish language immersion program. One of the public schools in Carroll Gardens, The Carroll School (P.S. 58), also has one of the area&#x27;s French dual-language programs, which was one of the first such French programs at a public school in the city. A Catholic mass in French is said every Sunday at the St. Agnes Church in Carroll Gardens. This initiative of the diocese of Brooklyn occurred after the neighboring Archdiocese of New York, incurred the wrath of French worshipers in Manhattan by deciding to close the French national parish of St. Vincent de Paul Church. French expatriates operate several restaurants and shops in the neighborhood, including La Cigogne, Café Luluc, Provence en boite, French Louie, Chez Moi, and Bar Tabac.

==Carroll Gardens Historic District==

The development of what is now the Carroll Gardens Historic District began in the 1870s, due in part to its proximity to Carroll Park. The district was created by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1973. It includes houses located in a rough rectangle bounded by Carroll, President, Smith, and Hoyt Streets, as well as the western ends of the two blocks between President Street and First Street. The district includes some of the finest examples of brownstones with large front gardens.

<doc id="421556" wikidata="Q1346856" url="?curid=421556" title="Dan (ancient city)">
<text>Dan (), and older name Laish, is an ancient city mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, described as the northernmost city of the Kingdom of Israel, and belonging to the tribe of Dan, its namesake. It was later the site of a royal sanctuary built by Jeroboam.

The city is identified with a tell located in Upper Galilee, northern Israel, known as Tel Dan (; &quot;Mound of Dan&quot;) in Hebrew and Tell el-Qadi (&quot;Mound of the Judge&quot;) in Arabic, a popular translation of the ancient Hebrew name. The site was occupied continuously from the Early Bronze Age through the Iron Age II, the time of the Kingdom of Israel. While evidence suggests a period of abandonment during the Persian era, it was later rebuilt as a Hellenistic city with a notable shrine.

==Identification and names==
The Hebrew Bible states that prior to its conquest by the tribe of Dan the site was known as Laish with variant spellings within the Books of Joshua, Judges and Isaiah. In it is called Leshem, which means &quot;jewel&quot;. has the alternative name &quot;Laishah&quot; &quot;Lioness&quot; in a number of translations.

Rabbinic works, and writers like Philostorgius, Theodoret, Benjamin of Tudela and Samuel ben Samson, all incorrectly identified Dan or Laish, with Banias (Paneas). Eusebius of Caesarea more accurately places Dan/Laish in the vicinity of Paneas at the fourth mile on the route to Tyre.

The Arab name of the archaeological site, Tell el-Qadi, meaning &quot;the tell of the judge,&quot; plays on the distinction between Arabic &quot;din&quot; and Hebrew &quot;dan,&quot; offering a popular translation of the ancient Hebrew name. 19th century Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt identified the source of the Jordan River having the name &quot;Dhan&quot; () in his travelogue published posthumously in 1822. The American naval officer William F. Lynch was the first to identify &quot;Tell el-Qadi&quot; as the site of the ancient city of Dan in 1849. Three years later, Edward Robinson made the same identification, and this identification is now securely accepted.

&quot;Tel Dan&quot; is the modern Israeli name for the site, based on the original Biblical name.

==Geography==

Dan is situated in the area known as the Galilee Panhandle, which is a part of Upper Galilee. To the west is the southern part of Mount Lebanon; to the east and north are the Hermon mountains. Melting snow from the Hermon mountains provides the majority of the water of the Jordan River, and passes through Dan, making the immediate area highly fertile. The lush vegetation that results makes the area around Dan seem somewhat out of place in the otherwise arid region around it. Due to its location close to the border with Syria and Lebanon at the far north of the territory which fell under the British Mandate of Palestine, the site has a long and often bitterly contested modern history, most recently during the 1967 Six-Day War.

==Biblical narrative ==
===Laish/Leshem===
According to the Book of Judges, prior to the Tribe of Dan occupying the land, the town was known as Laish (), meaning lion, or rather lioness. , although telling the same story as Judges 18, names the city as Leshem, which makes the researchers consider it as being the same place.

Laish was allied with the Sidonians. This might indicate they were Phoenicians (Sidonians were Phoenicians from the city of Sidon), who may or may not have been Canaanite. The alliance offered little practical benefit due to the remoteness of Laish from Sidon, and the intervening Lebanon mountains. The town was also isolated from the Assyrians and Aram by the Hermon mountains; the Septuagint mentions that the town was unable to have an alliance with the Aramaeans. The Masoretic Text does not mention the Aramaeans, but instead states that the town had no relationship with &quot;any man&quot; – textual scholars believe that this is a scribal error, with &quot;adham&quot; (&quot;man&quot;) being a mistake for &quot;Aram&quot;.

===Israelite city of Dan===
According to the Book of Judges story of Micah&#x27;s Idol, the Tribe of Dan did not at that point have any territory to their name (), and so, after scouting out the land, eventually decided to attack Laish, as the land around it was fertile, and the town was demilitarised. The Bible describes the Tribe of Dan with 600 men brutally defeating the people of Laish and burning it to the ground, and then building their city in the same spot. The narrative states that Laish became known as Dan after the tribe. They then erected a sanctuary that housed the idol stolen from Micah, which was served by a priest who was Moses&#x27; grandson. The sanctuary later received one of the two golden calves of Jeroboam, and remained in use until the &quot;time of captivity of the land&quot; and the time that the &quot;house of God&quot; ceased to be in Shiloh. Scholars think that the former refers to the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by Tiglath-Pileser III in 733/732, and that the latter refers to the time of Hezekiah&#x27;s religious reform; an alternative possibility, however, supported by a minority of scholars, is that &quot;time of captivity of the land&quot; is a scribal error and should read &quot;time of captivity of the Ark&quot;, referring to the battle of Eben-Ezer, and the Philistine capture of the Ark, and that the ceasing of the &quot;house of God&quot; being in Shiloh refers to this also.

====Golden calf worship====
According to and , Jeroboam erected two golden calves as gods in Bethel and Dan. Textual scholars believe that this is where the Elohist story of Aaron&#x27;s golden calf originates due to opposition in some sections of Israelite society, including the Elohists, to the seeming idol-worship of Jeroboam. However, some Biblical scholars believe that Jeroboam was trying to outdo the Temple in Jerusalem, by creating a seat for God that spanned the entire Kingdom of Israel rather than just the small space above the Ark of the Covenant in Jerusalem. The Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple of Judah was represented by a cherub on either side, so Jeroboam might have been using the calves to represent the sides of his sanctuary, implying his whole kingdom was equal in holiness to the Ark.

==Archaeology==
According to the archaeological excavations at the site, the town was originally occupied in the Late Neolithic period (c. 4500 BCE), and at some time in the fourth millennium BCE it was abandoned for almost 1,000 years.

===Early Bronze===
Laish was a fortified settlement during the Early Bronze Age.

===Middle Bronze===
The Egyptians cursed Laish in execration texts written during the Middle Kingdom. It has been speculated that the repetition in such texts of formulas from older ones dating to the Old Kingdom (27th–22nd century BCE) seem to indicate that they reflected the historical reality of the Early Bronze Age, rather than that of the Middle Bronze Age.

The excavators of Tel Dan uncovered a city gate made of mud bricks on top of megalithic basalt blocks called orthostats, estimated to have been built during the Middle Bronze Age around 1750 BCE. As of 2009, its three constituent &#x27;true&#x27; arches were the oldest complete and free-standing monumental arches made of mud-brick known in the world. Its popular name is Abraham&#x27;s Gate, due to the biblical story that Abraham travelled to Dan to rescue his nephew Lot (:). The gate was restored in the late 2000s and has become a popular tourist attraction.

Hazor was the regional power during the Middle Bronze II, subordinate to Qatna to the north and with trade routes to Mari in the Middle Euphrates.

===Late Bronze===
====Egyptian period====
In the 15th century BCE, Tuthmosis III conquered Dan (called &quot;Laysha&quot;) along others (Egyptian hieroglyphs did not distinguish between L and R).

===Iron Age I===
During the Iron Age I, Egyptian withdrawal from Canaan led Laish (Dan) to become an independent entity allied with the Sidonians.

It remained independent until the 10th century BCE, when it was annexed by the Northern Kingdom of Israel or one of the Aramean kingdoms.

In Judges 18 it is told that there was no king in the land. The Tribe of Dan were seeking an inheritance for themselves, so they sent five of their clan leaders from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land of Laish. The Danites then conquered Laish with an army of 600 men burning the city to the ground and rebuilding it as Dan.

===Iron Age II===

In Iron II, the Northern Kingdom of Israel seem to have gained control over Dan.

====Israelite city wall and gate====
The Israelite gate was built at a different location than the Canaanite gate.

In 1992, in order to tidy up the site for presentation to visitors, a heap of debris was removed which dated from the time of the Assyrian destruction of the city by Tiglath-Pileser III in 733/2 BCE. A hitherto unknown earlier gateway to the city was uncovered. The entrance complex led to a courtyard paved with stone with a low stone platform. In the 9th century BCE, the podium was enlarged, and major fortifications were built, a city wall with buttresses and a complex gate. The podium was enlarged further in the 8th century BCE by Jeroboam II, then destroyed by Tiglath-Pileser III.

====Seat of king or judge====
At the Israelite gate there is a raised square platform reached by two steps. Decorated stone sockets in the corners may have been created to hold canopy poles. It may have been the base of the king&#x27;s seat, where he would sit in judgment.

====Tel Dan stele====

Within the remains of the city wall, close to the entrance of the outer gate, parts of the stele were found. The basalt stone bears an Aramaic inscription referring to one of the kings of Damascus; the excavators of the site believe that the king it refers to is Hazael (c 840 BCE), though a minority argue that it instead refers to Ben-Hadad (c 802 BCE). A small part of the inscription remains, with text containing the letters &#x27;ביתדוד&#x27; (&quot;BYTDWD&quot;), which most archaeologists agree refers to &quot;House of David&quot; (&quot;Beth David&quot; in Hebrew.) In the line directly above, the text reads &#x27;MLK YSR&#x27;L&#x27;, i.e. &quot;King of Israel&quot;. Hebrew script from the era is vowel-less, which would make the inscription the first time that the name &quot;David&quot; has been found at an archaeological site dating before 500 BCE.

Dan suffered in the era of expansion by the Aramaeans, due to being the closest city to them in the kingdom of Israel. The several incursions indicated by the Book of Kings suggest that Dan changed hands at least four times between the Kingdom of Israel and Aramaeans, around the time that Israel was ruled by Ahab and the Aramaeans by Ben Hadad I, and their successors. Around this time, the Tel Dan stele was created by the Aramaeans, during one of the periods of their control of Dan.

When the Assyrian empire expanded to the south, the kingdom of Israel initially became a vassal state, but after rebelling, the Assyrians invaded and the town fell to Tiglath-Pileser III in 733/732 BCE.

====Cultic area, altar====
Excavations at the cultic area of Dan have revealed a religious compound with a large four-horned central altar and presenting a diverse amount of cult paraphernalia. These findings seem to be in line with the biblical account which portrays Dan as a major cultic center of the Kingdom of Israel from the reign of Jeroboam ().

===Later periods===
During the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods, remains indicate that cultic activities continued around the podium (also known as &quot;the High Place&quot;).

==Tel Dan Nature Reserve==
The Tel Dan Nature Reserve was first declared on 39 hectares surrounding the Tel in 1974. 9 hectares were added to the reserve in 1989. The Dan River is one of the three water sources of the Jordan River which meet in the northern part of the Hula Valley. Notable points of interest include Paradise Springs, the Abraham or Canaanite Gate and the Israelite Gate.

<doc id="421565" wikidata="Q49538" url="?curid=421565" title="Delta II">
<text>Delta II was an expendable launch system, originally designed and built by McDonnell Douglas, and sometimes known as the Thorad Delta 1. Delta II was part of the Delta rocket family, derived directly from the Delta 3000, and entered service in 1989. There were two main variants, the Delta 6000 and Delta 7000, with the latter also having &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Heavy&quot; subvariants. During its career, Delta II flew several notable payloads, including 24 Global Positioning System (GPS) Block II satellites, several dozen NASA payloads, and 60 Iridium communication satellites. The rocket flew its final mission, ICESat-2, on 15 September 2018, earning the launch vehicle a streak of 100 successful missions in a row, with the last failure being GPS IIR-1 in 1997. In the late 1990s, Delta II was developed further into the unsuccessful Delta III, which was in turn developed into the more capable and successful Delta IV, though the latter shares little heritage with the original Thor and Delta rockets.

== History ==
In the early 1980s, all United States expendable launch vehicles were planned to be phased out in favor of the Space Shuttle, which would be responsible for all government and commercial launches. Production of Delta, Atlas-Centaur, and Titan 34D had ended. The &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of 1986 and the subsequent halt of Shuttle operations changed this policy, and President Ronald Reagan announced in December 1986 that the Space Shuttle would no longer launch commercial payloads, and NASA would seek to purchase launches on expendable vehicles for missions that did not require crew or Shuttle support.

McDonnell Douglas, at that time the manufacturer of the Delta family, signed a contract with the U.S. Air Force in 1987 to provide seven Delta II. These were intended to launch a series of Global Positioning System (GPS) Block II satellites, which had previously been manifested for the Space Shuttle. The Air Force exercised additional contract options in 1988, expanding this order to 20 vehicles, and NASA purchased its first Delta II in 1990 for the launch of three Earth-observing satellites. The first Delta II launch occurred on 14 February 1989, with a Delta 6925 boosting the first GPS Block II satellite (USA-35) from Launch Complex 17A (SLC-17A) at Cape Canaveral into a high medium Earth orbit.

The first Delta II 7000-series flew on 26 November 1990, replacing the RS-27 engine of the 6000-series with the more powerful RS-27A engine. Additionally, the steel-cased Castor 4A solid boosters of the 6000 series were replaced with the composite-cased GEM 40. All further Delta II launches except three were of this upgraded configuration, and the 6000-series was retired in 1992 with the last launch being on July 24.

McDonnell Douglas began Delta III development in the mid-1990s as increasing satellite mass required more powerful launch vehicles. Delta III, with its liquid hydrogen second stage and more powerful GEM 46 boosters, could bring twice as much mass as Delta II to geostationary transfer orbit, but a string of two failures and one partial failure, along with the development of the much more powerful Delta IV, led to the cancellation of the Delta III program. The upgraded boosters would still find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy.

On 28 March 2003, the Air Force Space Command began the process of deactivating the Delta II launch facilities and infrastructure at Cape Canaveral once the last of the second-generation GPS satellites were launched. However, in 2008, it instead announced that it would transfer all the Delta II facilities and infrastructure to NASA to support the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) in 2011.

On 14 December 2006, with the launch of USA-193, was the first launch of the Delta II operated by United Launch Alliance.

The last GPS launch aboard a Delta II and the final launch from SLC-17A at Cape Canaveral occurred in 2009. The GRAIL Launch in 2011 marked the last Delta II Heavy launch and the last from Florida. The final five launches would all be from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

On 16 July 2012, NASA selected the Delta II to support the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1 – NOAA-20) missions. This marked the final purchase of Delta II. OCO-2 was launched on 2 July 2014, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) was launched on 31 January 2015, and JPSS-1 was launched on 18 November 2017. All three of these launches were placed into orbit from SLC-2 at Vandenberg.

The Delta II family launched 155 times. Its only unsuccessful launches were Koreasat 1 in 1995, and GPS IIR-1 in 1997. The Koreasat 1 launch was a partial failure caused by one booster not separating from the first stage, which resulted in the satellite being placed in a lower-than-intended orbit. By using reserve fuel, it was able to achieve its proper geosynchronous orbit and operated for 10 years. The GPS IIR-1 was a total loss as the Delta II exploded 13 seconds after launch. The explosion occurred when a damaged solid rocket booster casing ruptured and triggered the vehicle&#x27;s flight termination system. No one was injured, and the launch pad itself was not seriously impacted, though several cars were destroyed and a few buildings were damaged.

In 2007, Delta II completed its 75th consecutive successful launch, surpassing the 74 consecutive successful launches of the Ariane 4. With the launch of ICESat-2 in 2018, Delta II reached 100 consecutive successful launches.

During its career, Delta II achieved a peak launch rate of 12 launches in a single year, although its infrastructure was capable of supporting up to 15 launches per year.

While all completed Delta II rockets were launched, many flight-qualified spare parts remained in inventory. These spare parts were assembled, alongside a few structural simulators, to create a nearly complete Delta II for exhibition in its 7320-10C configuration. The rocket is displayed vertically at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and bears its popular &quot;shark teeth&quot; livery on its fairing, which was painted on past Delta II rockets for the GPS launches.

== Vehicle description ==

=== First stage ===
The first stage of the Delta II was propelled by a Rocketdyne RS-27 or RS-27A main engine burning RP-1 and liquid oxygen. This stage was technically referred to as the &quot;Extra-Extended Long Tank Thor&quot;, a derivative of the Thor ballistic missile as were all Delta rockets until the Delta IV. The RS-27 used on the 6000-series Delta II produced of thrust, while the upgraded RS-27A used by the 7000-series produced . The stage was long and wide, had a mass of when fueled, and burned for 260 seconds. The main engine, which could not throttle, provided pitch and yaw control for the vehicle during ascent using hydraulic gimballing. In addition, two Rocketdyne LR-101-NA-11 vernier engines provided roll control for the first stage during ascent and continued firing after the main engine shut down to stabilize the vehicle before stage separation.

The two first-stage tanks were constructed from aluminum isogrid panels, providing high strength at a lower mass. Nitrogen gas was used to pressurize the tanks. These tanks were stretched a total of from those of the Extended Long Tank Thor that flew on older Delta rockets, providing more propellant. Between the two tanks was the &quot;center body&quot;, where first-stage avionics and communications equipment were housed. The solid rocket booster attachment points were located on the outside of the liquid oxygen tank and the aft skirt, the latter of which also contained a gyroscope for vehicle stability.

=== Solid rocket boosters ===
For additional thrust during launch, the Delta II used solid boosters. For the 6000-series, Delta II used Castor 4A boosters (sometimes stylized as &quot;Castor IVA&quot;), while the 7000-series used GEM 40 Graphite-Epoxy Motors manufactured by Alliant Techsystems (ATK). Like its predecessors, the Delta II 6000-series was only offered in nine-booster configurations. However, with the arrival of the 7000-series, variants with three and four boosters were introduced to allow Delta II to fly small payloads for cheaper. When three or four boosters were used, all ignited on the ground at launch, while models that used nine boosters would ignite six on the ground, then the remaining three would ignite in flight after the burnout and jettison of the first six. 

The Castor 4A boosters were an improvement over the Castor 4 motors flown on the earlier Delta 3000 rocket, replacing the propellant with more modern HTPB-based propellant and providing an 11% increase in performance. The GEM 40 boosters on the 7000 series further improved Delta II&#x27;s performance by each featuring of extra propellant than the Castor 4A thanks to a lengthening of . In addition, the GEM boosters also boasted a lower dry mass than the Castors due to the former&#x27;s carbon composite construction.

In 2003, the Delta II Heavy debuted, featuring larger GEM 46 motors from the abandoned Delta III program. These new motors allowed the vehicle to carry over of extra payload into low-Earth orbit. Only Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 17B was capable of flying the Heavy configuration, as it was previously reinforced to handle the Delta III.

The Castor motor nozzles were angled 11° from vertical to aim their thrust into the vehicle&#x27;s center of gravity, while the GEM motors had a slightly lower 10° tilt. On the nine-engine configuration, the three air-lit motors featured longer nozzles to allow the boosters to perform better in the upper atmosphere. All solid motors that flew on the Delta II featured fixed nozzles, meaning the first stage was solely responsible for vehicle control during the initial portions of the flight.

=== Delta-K second stage ===
The second stage of Delta II was the Delta-K, powered by a restartable (up to six restarts) Aerojet AJ10-118K engine burning hypergolic Aerozine-50 and . These propellants are highly toxic and corrosive, and once loaded the launch had to occur within approximately 37 days or the stage would have to be refurbished or replaced. This stage also contained a combined inertial platform and guidance system that controlled all flight events.

The Delta-K consisted of stainless steel tanks and a lightweight aluminum structure. The tanks were pressurized with helium gas, and the stage featured nitrogen thrusters for roll control during burns and for complete attitude control during coasts. The stage had a mass of when empty, and when fully fueled.

=== Third stage ===
For low Earth orbit missions, Delta II was not equipped with a third stage. Payloads bound for higher energy orbits such as GTO or to reach Earth escape velocity for trans-Mars injection or other destinations beyond Earth used an HTPB solid propellant third stage, situated inside the fairing during launch. This stage was spin-stabilized and depended on the second stage for proper orientation prior to stage separation, but was sometimes equipped with a hydrazine nutation control system to maintain proper spin axis. The third stage would be spun up using small rocket motors and then released by the second stage to perform its burn. The third stage also included a yo-weight system to induce tumbling in the stage after payload separation to prevent recontact, or a yo-yo de-spin mechanism to slow the rotation before payload release. The stage would also contain an S-band transmitter, batteries, and a sequencer to command the stage events.

Two third-stage options were available, both consisting of a single solid rocket motor. The most common by far was Star 48, flying on over 70 missions. The Star 48, also referred to as the Payload Assist Module-Delta (PAM-D, PAM-Delta), was the more, powerful of the two options, producing an average thrust of about during its 87.1 seconds of burn time. The stage would end up flying primarily on the more powerful Delta variants and never flew on the three-booster configuration.

The other third-stage option was Star 37FM. This stage flew four times, and only on three- and four-booster configurations of Delta. Star 37FM produced about of thrust during its 66.4-second burn.

== Naming system ==
The Delta II family used a four-digit system to generate its technical names:
* The first digit was either 6 or 7, denoting the 6000- or 7000-series Delta;
* The second digit indicated the number of boosters. Most Delta II rockets flew with 9 boosters, but some flew with 3 or 4;
* The third digit was always 2, denoting a second stage with an Aerojet AJ10 engine. Only Deltas prior to the 6000-series used a different engine, the TR-201;
* The last digit denoted the third stage. 0 denoted no third stage, 5 indicated a Payload Assist Module (PAM) stage with Star 48B being used, and 6 indicated it used the Star 37FM motor for a PAM.
* An H following the four digits denoted that the vehicle used larger Delta III GEM 46 boosters. The Heavy variant could be launched only from Cape Canaveral (as Vandenberg&#x27;s pad wasn&#x27;t modified to handle the larger SRBs) and was retired with the closure of that launch site in 2011;
* Numbers and letters following those indicate the type of fairing. -9.5 means that the vehicle had a diameter fairing, -10 means an aluminum diameter fairing, -10C means a composite diameter fairing, and -10L indicates a lengthened diameter composite fairing. In some early Delta II flights, a fairing, about 8-feet in diameter (from older Delta rockets) was flown, and those vehicles had the -8 designation.

For example, a Delta 7925H-10L used the RS-27A, nine GEM 46 boosters, a PAM third stage, and a lengthened diameter fairing. A Delta 6320–9.5 is a two-stage vehicle with an RS-27 first-stage engine, three Castor 4A boosters, a diameter fairing, and no third stage.

== Launch profile ==
; Launch vehicle build-up: A Delta II launch vehicle was assembled vertically on the launch pad. Assembly started by hoisting the first stage into position. The solid rocket boosters were then hoisted into position and mated with the first stage. Launch vehicle build-up then continued with the second stage being hoisted atop the first stage.

; Fueling: It took approximately 20 minutes to load the first stage with of fuel.

: At T-45 minutes, fueling completion was confirmed. At T-20 minutes, the FTS pyros were armed. At T-20 minutes and T-4 minutes, two built-in holds occurred. During these holds, final launch checkouts were performed. At T-11 seconds SRB igniters were armed. Ignition of the main engine was at T-0.4 seconds. The ascent profile varies between missions.

; SRB staging: If 9 solid rocket boosters were used, only six were ignited at launch. After about a minute, once the first six were depleted, three air-start motors would ignite for another minute and the ground-start motors would separate. The air-start motors had nozzles optimized for high-altitude as they operated mostly in a near-vacuum during the flight.

: If only 3 or 4 boosters were used, all were ignited on the ground and jettisoned at the same time.

The last Delta II launch was the ICESat-2 satellite in September 2018.

In 2008, ULA indicated that it had &quot;around half a dozen&quot; unsold Delta II rockets on hand, but in October 2017, ULA CEO Tory Bruno stated that there are no complete, unbooked Delta II rockets left in ULA inventory. However, there are leftover Delta II parts which are not enough to build another vehicle. The final Delta II, made of these leftover parts alongside some simulated parts, is located at the Kennedy Space Center rocket garden.

== Space debris (a.k.a, &quot;Space junk&quot;) ==
The only person on record ever hit by space debris, Mrs. Lottie Williams, was hit by a small, light piece of a Delta II rocket. Mrs. Williams was exercising in a park in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 22 January 1997 when she was hit in the shoulder by a piece of blackened metallic material. The U.S. Space Command confirmed that a used Delta II rocket from the April 1996 launch of the Midcourse Space Experiment had crashed into the atmosphere 30 minutes earlier. The object tapped her on the shoulder and fell off harmlessly onto the ground. Williams collected the item and NASA tests later showed that the fragment was consistent with the materials of the rocket, and Nicholas Johnson, the agency&#x27;s chief scientist for orbital debris, believes that she was, indeed hit by a piece of a recently launched Delta II.

Delta rockets have been involved in multiple fragmentation events as they were routinely left in orbit with enough fuel to explode. A large amount of current &quot;space junk&quot; is Delta rocket debris.

<text>Sir Michael Louis David Fabricant (born 12 June 1950) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield in Staffordshire, formerly Mid Staffordshire, from 1992 until his defeat in 2024.

Fabricant was the vice-chairman of the Conservative Party for parliamentary campaigning, responsible for the Conservative Campaign Headquarters strategy on marginal seats at the 2015 general election, as well as UK parliamentary by-elections. In April 2014, he was dismissed from this position over comments he had made about his colleague Maria Miller&#x27;s resignation.

==Early life and career==
Michael Louis David Fabricant was born on 12 June 1950 in Rottingdean, Brighton, into a Jewish family, to Helena (née Freed; 1911–2004) and Rabbi Isaac Fabricant (1906–1989), rabbi of the Brighton and Hove Synagogue.

Fabricant attended Brighton Secondary Technical School and Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School. He studied economics at Loughborough University, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree. He went on to study at the University of Sussex, where he was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in operations research in 1974, and undertook research at the University of Oxford, University of London, and the University of Southern California in economics and econometrics.

He was director and co-founder of an international broadcast manufacturing and management group for 11 years prior to his election to Parliament.

Fabricant was the Conservative candidate in South Shields at the 1987 general election, coming second with 25.7% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP David Clark. Fabricant was appointed the chairman of the Brighton Pavilion Conservative Association in 1990 and remained chairman until his election to the House of Commons.

==Parliamentary career==
Fabricant was elected to Parliament at the 1992 general election as MP for Mid Staffordshire with 49.7% of the vote and a majority of 6,236. He made his maiden speech on 2 July 1992.

In Parliament, Fabricant joined the European Legislation Select Committee in 1992, and served on it until the 1997 general election. He joined the National Heritage Select Committee in 1993 and was a member of that committee until his appointment as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury Michael Jack in 1996. 

Prior to the 1997 general election, Fabricant&#x27;s constituency of Mid Staffordshire was abolished, and replaced with Lichfield. At the election, Fabricant was elected as MP for Lichfield with 42.9% of the vote and a majority of 238.

Following the Conservative defeat at the 1997 general election, Fabricant joined the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee until moving to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 1999. 

At the 2001 general election, Fabricant was re-elected as MP for Lichfield with an increased vote share of 49.1% and an increased majority of 4,426.

Fabricant rejoined the Culture, Media and Sport committee following the 2001 general election, and also at this time became the chairman of the Information Committee. He moved up to the opposition frontbench as a trade and industry spokesman under Michael Howard in 2003. Later in the year he was moved to the post of spokesman on economic affairs. 

Fabricant was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 48.6% and an increased majority of 7,080.

He became an opposition whip following the 2005 general election and remained in the position following the appointment of new leader David Cameron. In 2008, Fabricant founded Conservative Friends of America.

Also in 2008, Fabricant took part in a series of adjournment debates on government funding for inland waterways, and called for heavy goods freight to move off Britain&#x27;s roads and back onto the restored canal network.

At the 2010 general election, Fabricant was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 54.4% and an increased majority of 17,683.

In November 2012, Fabricant published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Pact&quot;, which called for a political pact between UKIP and the Conservative Party, in exchange for an In/out EU referendum.

Fabricant was sacked as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party in April 2014 after he tweeted &quot;about time&quot; with regard to Maria Miller&#x27;s resignation as cabinet minister. George Eaton of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; believed his sacking related to his threat to rebel over the HS2 rail development and was necessary to deter other potential Conservative rebels on the same issue. He opposes HS2 on the grounds of its financial and environmental cost.

At the 2015 general election, Fabricant was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 55.2% and an increased majority of 18,189.

In a 2016 debate, Fabricant yelled &quot;bollocks&quot; over a discussion of the impacts of Brexit. He was expressing disagreement with the former justice minister Jonathan Djanogly&#x27;s statement that UK law firms could lose £1.7 billion in earnings if the UK were to leave the European Union. In the 2016 EU Referendum campaign Fabricant said he would be voting to leave the EU. A staunch believer in free trade, he commented: &quot;I think we are part of a global economy and that we will be far wealthier trading globally than the current situation&quot;. 

Fabricant was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 63.6% and an increased majority of 18,581.

Fabricant wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2017 to rebut claims about him that had appeared on a Westminster dossier making assertions about the behaviour of Conservative MPs. He wrote that no one he had contacted, including lobby journalists and a former chief whip with an &quot;elephantine memory&quot;, had previously heard the claim made against him of &quot;inappropriate behaviour with a male journalist in a taxi&quot;.

In the House of Commons, he sat on the Administration Committee and previously sat on the Committee of Selection, the Finance and Services Committee, the Liaison Committee (Commons), the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the National Heritage Committee.

Fabricant attracted media attention for having an apartheid-era flag of South Africa on display on the mantelpiece of his parliamentary office. He responded that he had several flags on display from countries where his former company had clients in the 1980s. Asked in 2018 if he regretted working for what was effectively an arm of the apartheid state in South Africa, he replied: &quot;There is so much we can all regret with hindsight&quot; and said he did not condone what was going on at the time.

At the 2019 general election, Fabricant was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 64.5% and an increased majority of 23,638.

On 12 April 2022, Fabricant urged Boris Johnson to apologise after he was fined for a breach of Covid rules. Fabricant said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think at any time he thought he was breaking the law. I think that at the time he just thought like many teachers and nurses who after a very long shift would tend to go back to the staff room and have a quiet drink&quot;. The remark was criticised by official bodies representing teachers and nurses, who said they did no such thing, and Fabricant said he had not intended to cause offence.

Fabricant endorsed Penny Mordaunt during the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. He was knighted in Johnson&#x27;s resignation honours.

In March 2024, Fabricant was re-selected as the Conservative candidate for Lichfield at the 2024 general election, in which he lost his seat.

==Use of social media==
In June 2014, Fabricant came under criticism when, following an exchange between Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Rod Liddle on &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; the evening before, he tweeted that he &quot;could never appear&quot; on a discussion programme with her, as he &quot;would either end up with a brain haemorrhage or by punching her in the throat.&quot; Gloria De Piero, then Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, described the tweet as &quot;utterly appalling&quot; while a Conservative Party spokesman commented that the MP&#x27;s comment was &quot;completely unacceptable&quot;. Fabricant subsequently apologised, but Alibhai-Brown thought his apology was &quot;useless&quot;. A few days later, Fabricant wrote that he was &quot;still deeply embarrassed and ashamed&quot; and his tweet &quot;appeared to have undone&quot; his socially liberal voting record over the last 20 years.

In August 2014, after Sayeeda Warsi resigned from David Cameron&#x27;s government over its policy towards Israel&#x27;s Operation Protective Edge, Fabricant was criticised for a Twitter remark that appeared to suggest Gaza was a &quot;Muslim issue&quot;. He subsequently clarified that he believed that Gaza was a humanitarian issue and that his comment about Warsi&#x27;s &quot;strong views on Muslim issues&quot; was more general.

In May 2018, Fabricant called a teenage constituent a &#x27;complete twat&#x27; on Twitter after she had questioned his commitment to working in part of the constituency. Fabricant criticised the constituent for not being clearer in detailing who she was and stated that he thought the post came from a &#x27;Russian troll&#x27;.

In July 2018, Fabricant was accused of being Islamophobic over a subsequently-deleted tweet he shared depicting London mayor Sadiq Khan, who is a Muslim, in a sex act with a pig. Some Labour MPs called for Fabricant&#x27;s suspension and former Conservative Party chairman Sayeeda Warsi responded, describing Islamophobia in the Conservative party as &quot;widespread&quot;. Fabricant said he had been distracted in a meeting when he sent it and did not spot what the image actually showed.

In May 2021, Fabricant was accused by Hope not Hate of racism, after he tweeted that pro-Palestinian protesters in London were &quot;primitives&quot; that are &quot;trying to bring to London what they do in the Middle East&quot;. Fabricant subsequently deleted the tweet, stating that &quot;attacks on the British police as shown in the video are disgraceful&quot;. The Conservative party was asked by &quot;The Guardian&quot; for comment but declined.

In March 2022, Fabricant commented on social media that a proposed bill outlawing cyberflashing should include an exemption for dating apps. This was criticised by local councillor Joanne Grange.

In May 2022 Fabricant commented in relation to the arrest of an anonymous Conservative MP for rape, tweeting: &quot;I am expecting a strong turnout of Conservative MPs at PMQs today, not only to demonstrate their strong support for Boris! BUT also to prove they are NOT the one told by the Chief Whip to stay at home. I&#x27;ll be there!&quot; The tweet was described by Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner as &quot;grotesque&quot;. Fabricant said: &quot;No-one is making light of rape or assault. Far from it. But those who want to read something into a comment will contrive to do so whatever. They are professional offence takers.&quot; Fabricant deleted his original tweet just over two hours later.

==Media work==
===&quot;The Final Cut&quot;, BBC===
Fabricant was political adviser to the 1995 BBC drama series &quot;The Final Cut&quot; and made a cameo appearance in the broadcast.

===&quot;Celebrity First Dates&quot;, Channel 4===
During Prime Minister&#x27;s Question Time on 13 September 2017, the prime minister, Theresa May, said that Fabricant would be appearing on the Channel 4 series &quot;Celebrity&quot; &quot;First Dates&quot;. She asked: &quot;What I&#x27;m not sure about is whether my honourable friend is the celebrity or the first date&quot;. Nearly two months later, at the beginning of November 2017, Fabricant came out as bisexual on the show.

==Personal life==
Fabricant lives in London and Lichfield. He co-owns a holiday home in Snowdonia with his partner Andy Street, the former Mayor of the West Midlands. Fabricant, who in December 2021 described Street as his &#x27;life partner&#x27;, is bisexual. 

In 2015 Fabricant was diagnosed with skin cancer and prostate cancer, undergoing a prostatectomy as treatment for the latter. He spoke of his treatment for prostate cancer in the House of Commons the following year, highlighting the shortage of specialist prostate cancer nurses in the National Health Service. Then Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn responded to Fabricant&#x27;s illness by stating he hoped &quot;the treatment he got is the same treatment everyone else got&quot;. Following criticism, Corbyn apologised for his remarks.

Fabricant&#x27;s blond hair has been the subject of speculation, with some people suggesting he wears a wig. He has stated his hair is a personal matter.

==Honours==
Fabricant was appointed a Knight Bachelor on 9 June 2023 as part of the 2022 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours.

<doc id="421574" wikidata="Q5591284" url="?curid=421574" title="Grace McCarthy">
<text>Grace Mary McCarthy, OC, OBC, LLD, DTech, FRAIC (Hon.) (née Winterbottom; October 14, 1927 – May 24, 2017) was a Canadian politician and florist in British Columbia. A high-ranking member of the Social Credit Party of British Columbia, she was largely responsible for rebuilding that party after its defeat in the 1972 provincial election.

==Political career==

In the 1960s, McCarthy was a popular elected member of the City of Vancouver Parks Board and instrumental in the creation of the VanDusen Botanical Gardens. She was actively recruited to run for a seat in the provincial Legislature by then-premier W.A.C. Bennett. In an attempt to improve his hold on power, Bennett promised that any woman elected to the legislature while he was in power would become a member of his Cabinet. In 1966, she successfully campaigned and was elected along with Les Peterson to co-represent the dual member riding of Vancouver-Little Mountain. Bennett made McCarthy a minister without portfolio, as well as Pat Jordan and Isabel Dawson.

In 1968, she successfully lobbied both the Canadian federal and British Columbian provincial governments to broaden home ownership credit legislation to include single, divorced and widowed women without the need for a male guarantor.

In the 1972 general election, the Socreds suffered its first electoral defeat to the New Democratic Party (NDP). McCarthy, then Socred party president in 1973, worked to rebuild the party. To that end, she increased membership in the party from 5,000 to 70,000 in two years. After the Socreds returned to power in the 1975 election, McCarthy became a senior cabinet minister, serving in a variety of portfolios, under Premier Bill Bennett.

In 1978, McCarthy was suspected of interfering in the re-drawing of the electoral boundaries of her Little Mountain constituency, to include an appendage of a wealthy Westside area of Vancouver, helping ensure her electoral success. This appendage and subsequent scandal became known as &quot;Gracie&#x27;s Finger&quot;. The actual area in question was between 16th and 33rd Avenues in Vancouver around the Arbutus Street corridor. In 1986, she parlayed the idea to illuminate the main cables of Vancouver&#x27;s Lions Gate Bridge and arranged private-sector sponsorship by the Guinness family, the bridge&#x27;s builders and original owners.

In addition, her many achievements included the following: lobbied to bring Expo 86 to Vancouver; established Canada’s first linear parkway and SkyTrain; negotiated lighting on the Lions Gate Bridge; spearheaded construction of the Vancouver Trade &amp; Convention Centre at Canada Harbour Place; initiated Canada’s first toll-free help line for abused children; brought the most comprehensive legislation to stop child abuse in the country; and initiated, alongside Justis Greene, BC’s first film promotion office, the Creative BC Film Commission.

=== Leadership contender ===
After Bennett stepped down in 1986, McCarthy stood in the 1986 leadership election to succeed him. She placed third, behind Brian Smith and victor Bill Vander Zalm. In Vander Zalm&#x27;s initial cabinet, she was named Deputy Premier of British Columbia and Minister of Economic Development. However, in a shuffle following the 1986 election, McCarthy gained responsibility for international trade but lost the deputy premier title, which she admitted left her a little disappointed.

On July 6, 1988, McCarthy resigned from cabinet, in protest of Vander Zalm&#x27;s leadership and the interference of &quot;arrogant&quot; civil servants in the premier&#x27;s office. Her resignation came just one week after Brian Smith had also resigned in protest of Vander Zalm&#x27;s leadership style.

After a series of scandals and discontent within caucus led to Vander Zalm&#x27;s resignation in 1991, McCarthy entered the 1991 leadership election to succeed him. Though considered the frontrunner in the contest, she was defeated in an upset by Rita Johnston, a Vander Zalm loyalist. NDP leader Mike Harcourt further stirred the pot by claiming that he preferred Johnston over McCarthy, asserting his belief that the latter would be a much tougher opponent in an election. Johnston lost the 1991 provincial election badly, with the party only winning third-place status in the legislature, behind the resurgent Liberal Party. Johnston lost her own seat and resigned as leader shortly thereafter. McCarthy was chosen to replace her at the 1993 leadership election.

Though finally achieving her goal of becoming the leader of the Social Credit party, McCarthy struggled as leader. First off, she unexpectedly lost her by-election in Matsqui, a stalwart Social Credit riding, to Liberal candidate Mike de Jong. Next, the Social Credit lost official party status in the BC Legislature when four of the remaining six MLAs left the party to join the fledgling BC Reform Party, rather than work with her as the leader. By 1994, after failing to get any semblance of control over the party, she resigned. In the 1996 election the Socreds lost all their remaining seats, never to return.

==Honours==
In 1992, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of British Columbia.

==Death==
McCarthy died on May 24, 2017, at age 89 after a lengthy battle with a brain tumour.

==Volunteer work==
Prior to her death, McCarthy was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the CH.I.L.D. Foundation (Children with Intestinal and Liver Disorders). McCarthy began the charity in 1995 with Mary McCarthy Parsons (her daughter) and J. Lindsay Gordon.

<doc id="421575" wikidata="Q3756454" url="?curid=421575" title="Sacred fire of Vesta">
<text>The sacred fire of Vesta was a sacred eternal flame in ancient Rome. The Vestal Virgins, originally numbering two, later four, and eventually six, were selected by lot and served for thirty years, tending the holy fire and performing other rituals connected to domestic life—among them were the ritual sweeping of the temple on June 15 and the preparation of food for certain festivals. By analogy, they also tended the life and soul of the city and of the body politic through the sacred fire of Vesta. The eternal burning of the sacred fire was a sign that determined eternal Rome.

The fire was renewed every year on the Kalends of March. Plutarch&#x27;s (c. 1st century AD) &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; records the Vestal Virgins’ use of burning mirrors to relight the fire:
If it (the fire) happens by any accident to be put out ... it is not to be lighted again from another fire, but new fire is to be gained by drawing a pure and unpolluted flame from the sunbeams. They kindle it generally with concave vessels of brass, formed by hollowing out an isosceles rectangular triangle, whose lines from the circumference meet in one single point. This being placed against the sun, causes its rays to converge in the centre, which, by reflection, acquiring the force and activity of fire, rarefy the air, and immediately kindle such light and dry matter as they think fit to apply. (tr. Langhorne 1821 1: 195) 

Allowing the sacred fire to die out was a serious dereliction of duty; it suggested that the goddess had withdrawn her protection from the city. Vestals guilty of this offence were punished by a scourging or a beating.

The sacred fire burned in Vesta&#x27;s circular temple, built in the Roman Forum below the Palatine Hill in pre-republican times. Among other sacred objects in the temple was the Palladium, a statue of Pallas Athena supposedly brought by Aeneas from Troy. The temple burned completely on at least four occasions and caught fire on two others. It was last rebuilt in AD 191 on the orders of Julia Domna, the wife of the emperor Septimius Severus.

The presence of a sacred fire was attributed to the legendary Roman king Numa Pompilius in the 7th century BC. It is known to have ended in 391 CE when Emperor Theodosius I banned pagan worship and had the flame extinguished.

<doc id="421577" wikidata="Q304095" url="?curid=421577" title="Michael Fallon">
<text>Sir Michael Cathel Fallon (born 14 May 1952) is a British politician who served as Secretary of State for Defence from 2014 to 2017. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sevenoaks from 1997 to 2019, having previously served as MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992.

Fallon attended the independent Epsom College and read Classics and Ancient History at the University of St Andrews. After university he joined the Conservative Research Department. Elected for Darlington at the 1983 general election, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education and Science in 1990. He lost his seat as MP for Darlington at the 1992 general election.

Fallon re-entered Parliament at the 1997 general election as MP for Sevenoaks. He served as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party from 2010 to 2012, Minister of State for Business and Enterprise from 2012 to 2014, Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change from 2013 to 2014 and Minister for Portsmouth in 2014. In the 2014 cabinet reshuffle he was promoted to Secretary of State for Defence. He resigned from the post after being implicated in the 2017 Westminster sexual misconduct allegations.

==Early life and career==
Michael Cathel Fallon was born in Perth, Perthshire, Scotland. His father was an Irish-born surgeon, Dr Martin Fallon, who was educated in Dublin and became a high-ranking medical officer in the British Army. Dr Fallon received the OBE for services to the wounded including at Arnhem. Michael Fallon was educated at Craigflower Preparatory School near Dunfermline and at Epsom College, a private boys&#x27; school in Surrey. He then read Classics and Ancient History at the University of St Andrews, graduating in 1974 with a Master of Arts (MA Hons) degree.

As a student, Fallon was active in the European Movement and the &quot;Yes&quot; youth campaign in the 1975 referendum. After university he joined the Conservative Research Department, working first for Lord Carrington in the House of Lords until 1977 and then as European desk officer until 1979. He became research assistant to Baroness Elles in 1979, around the time that she became an MEP.

==Parliamentary career==
He was selected as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Darlington in July 1982, and fought the Darlington by-election on 24 March 1983, which was held after the Labour MP Ted Fletcher had died. Although Fallon lost to Labour&#x27;s Ossie O&#x27;Brien by 2,412 votes, he defeated O&#x27;Brien 77 days later by 3,438 votes in the 1983 general election.

Fallon was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Energy Cecil Parkinson following the 1987 general election, and in 1988 joined the government of Margaret Thatcher as an Assistant Whip, becoming a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury in 1990. Fallon, alongside Michael Portillo and Michael Forsyth, visited Thatcher on the eve of her resignation in a last-ditch and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to persuade her to reconsider her decision.

===Junior minister in the Department for Education and Science===
Thatcher appointed Fallon Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Department for Education and Science in July 1990, a position he continued to hold under the new premiership of John Major. In this office Fallon headed legislation that led to the local management of schools, which among other changes gave schools a greater degree of financial independence, including control of their own bank accounts and cheque books. He remained in that office until the 1992 general election, when he lost his seat at Darlington to Labour&#x27;s Alan Milburn by a margin of 2,798 votes.

===Return to the House of Commons===
Fallon was selected to stand in the safe Conservative seat of Sevenoaks, after the sitting member, Mark Wolfson, decided not to stand again at the 1997 general election. At that election he held Sevenoaks with a substantially reduced majority.

Soon after his return to parliament, Fallon was appointed by William Hague as Opposition Spokesman for Trade and Industry and then as Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, but in October 1998 he resigned from the front bench, owing to ill health, remaining on the backbenches until Hague appointed him as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party.

From 1999 he was a member of the Treasury Select Committee and chairman of its Sub-Committee (2001–10). He also served on the executive committee of the 1922 Committee between 2005 and 2007.

In September 2012, David Cameron appointed Fallon as Minister for Business and Enterprise and he also became a Privy Councillor.

Fallon has been a director at Tullett Prebon, a leading brokerage firm in the City of London, and was one of the biggest supporters of the privatisation of the Royal Mail.

In January 2014, Fallon was appointed as Minister for Portsmouth. Six months later, on 15 July 2014, Cameron promoted him to the Cabinet, as Secretary of State for Defence.

===Secretary of State for Defence (2014–2017)===

In February 2016, the week after a leaked United Nations report had found the Saudi-led coalition guilty of conducting &quot;widespread and systematic&quot; air strikes against civilians in Yemen – including camps for internally displaced people, weddings, schools, hospitals, religious centers, vehicles and markets – and the same day the International Development Select Committee had said that the UK should end all arms exports to Saudi Arabia because of ongoing, large-scale human rights violations by the Kingdom&#x27;s armed forces in Yemen, Fallon was criticised for attending a £450-a-head dinner for an arms-industry trade-body.

In December 2016, Fallon admitted that UK-supplied internationally banned cluster munitions had been used in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s bombing campaign in Yemen.

In April 2017, Fallon confirmed that the UK would use its nuclear weapons in a &quot;pre-emptive initial strike&quot; in &quot;the most extreme circumstances&quot; on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme.

In 2017, Fallon warned that Russia&#x27;s Zapad 2017 exercise in Belarus and Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad Oblast was &quot;designed to provoke us&quot;. Fallon falsely claimed that number of Russian troops taking part in exercise could reach 100,000.

====European Union====
In an interview in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2016, before the European Union (EU) membership referendum, Fallon described himself as Eurosceptic and critical of many aspects of the EU, but said that he wanted Britain to remain in the EU, in the face of multiple threats from Russia&#x27;s president Vladimir Putin, crime, and international terrorism.

====Run-up to the 2015 general election====
During the run-up to the 2015 general election, Fallon wrote an article in &quot;The Times&quot; saying that Ed Miliband had stabbed his brother David Miliband in the back to become Labour leader and he would also stab Britain in the back to become prime minister. Fallon subsequently declined the opportunity to describe Miliband as a decent person and his comments embarrassed some Conservative supporters. Miliband gave a response, saying that Fallon had fallen below his usual standards and demeaned himself, which the &quot;New Statesman&quot; asserted was dignified, contrasting with Fallon&#x27;s counter-productive personal attack.

====Expenses scandal====
According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Fallon, Deputy Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, claimed for mortgage repayments on his Westminster flat in their entirety. MPs are only allowed to claim for interest charges.

Between 2002 and 2004, Fallon regularly claimed £1,255 per month in capital repayments and interest, rather than the £700–£800 for the interest component alone. After his error was noticed by staff at the Commons Fees Office in September 2004, he asked: &quot;Why has no one brought this to my attention before?&quot; He repaid £2,200 of this over-claim, but was allowed to offset the remaining £6,100 against his allowance. After realising they had failed to notice the excessive claims, Commons staff reportedly suggested Fallon submit fresh claims which would &quot;reassign&quot; the surplus payments to other costs he had legitimately incurred.

====Allegations of sexual harassment, inappropriate behaviour and resignation====

In late October 2017 it was reported that Fallon had repeatedly and inappropriately touched journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer&#x27;s knee during a dinner in 2002. Hartley-Brewer recalled that after Fallon kept putting his hand on her knee, she &quot;calmly and politely explained to him, that if he did it again, I would punch him in the face&quot;. Fallon resigned two days later believing his &quot;previous conduct&quot; towards women had &quot;fallen below&quot; what is acceptable. Hartley-Brewer expressed shock at the resignation, saying: &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel it was something that needed any further dealing with&quot;.

It was subsequently reported Fallon had been forced to resign in part due to an allegation of inappropriate and lewd comments towards fellow Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom when they both sat on the Treasury Select Committee. He was also accused of making comments of a sexual nature about other MPs on the committee and members of the public who attended hearings. The former political editor of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, Jane Merrick, said in &quot;The Observer&quot; in early November 2017 that Fallon was the previously unnamed Conservative MP who had &quot;lunged&quot; at her a decade and a half earlier. She had contacted Downing Street about the incident several hours before he resigned. &quot;The Observer&quot; reported on the same day that &quot;the revelation was the tipping point for No 10, which ... had been compiling a list of alleged incidents involving Fallon since claims against him were first made.&quot;

In September 2019, Fallon announced he would not seek re-election at the 2019 United Kingdom general election.

==Career outside Parliament==
Between 1992 and 1997, Fallon set up a chain of children&#x27;s nurseries called &quot;Just Learning&quot; with funding from the British &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; member Duncan Bannatyne, becoming chief executive.

==Personal life==
Fallon has been married to Wendy Elisabeth Payne, a HR professional, since 27 September 1986; the couple have two sons. The family lives in Sundridge, Kent.

He was banned from driving for 18 months in 1983 after admitting a drink-driving offence during the general election campaign.

Fallon was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for political and public service as part of the Resignation Honours of the outgoing prime minister David Cameron.

<doc id="421579" wikidata="Q1410847" url="?curid=421579" title="Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware">
<text>Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware or simply Tiki, originally known as TikiWiki, is a free and open source Wiki-based content management system and online office suite written primarily in PHP and distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL-2.1-only) license. In addition to enabling websites and portals on the internet and on intranets and extranets, Tiki contains a number of collaboration features allowing it to operate as a Geospatial Content Management System (GeoCMS) and Groupware web application.

Tiki includes all the basic features common to most CMSs such as the ability to register and maintain individual user accounts within a flexible and rich permission / privilege system, create and manage menus, RSS-feeds, customize page layout, perform logging, and administer the system. All administration tasks are accomplished through a browser-based user interface.

Tiki features an all-in-one design, as opposed to a core+extensions model followed by other CMSs. This allows for future-proof upgrades (since all features are released together), but has the drawback of an extremely large codebase (more than 1,000,000 lines).

Tiki can run on any computing platform that supports both a web server capable of running PHP 5 (including Apache HTTP Server, IIS, Lighttpd, Hiawatha, Cherokee, and nginx) and a MySQL/MariaDB database to store content and settings.

==Major components==
Tiki has four major categories of components: content creation and management tools, content organization tools and navigation aids, communication tools, and configuration and administration tools. These components enable administrators and users to create and manage content, as well as letting them communicate to others and configure sites.

In addition, Tiki allows each user to choose from various visual themes. These themes are implemented using CSS and the open source Smarty template engine. Additional themes can be created by a Tiki administrator for branding or customization as well.

==Internationalization==
Tiki is an international project, supporting many languages. The default interface language in Tiki is English, but any language that can be encoded and displayed using the UTF-8 encoding can be supported. Translated strings can be included via an external language file, or by translating interface strings directly, through the database. As of 29 September 2005, Tiki had been fully translated into eight languages and reportedly 90% or more translated into another five languages, as well as partial translations for nine additional languages.

Tiki also supports interactive translation of actual wiki pages and was the initial wiki engine used in the Cross Lingual Wiki Engine Project. This allows Tiki-based web sites to have translated &quot;content&quot; — not just the user interface.

==Implementation==
Tiki is developed primarily in PHP with some JavaScript code. It uses MySQL/MariaDB as a database. It will run on any server that provides PHP 5, including Apache and Microsoft&#x27;s IIS.

Tiki components make extensive use of other open source projects, including Zend Framework, Smarty, jQuery, HTML Purifier, FCKeditor, Raphaël, phpCAS, and Morcego. When used with Mapserver Tiki can become a Geospatial Content Management System.

==Project team==
Tiki is under active development by a large international community of over 300 developers and translators, and is one of the largest open-source teams in the world. Project members have donated the resources and bandwidth required to host the tiki.org website and various subdomains. The project members refer to this dependence on their own product as &quot;eating their own dogfood&quot;, which they have been doing since the early days of the project. Tiki community members also participate in various related events such as WikiSym and the Libre Software Meeting.

==History==
Tiki has been hosted on SourceForge.net since its initial release (Release 0.9, named Spica) in October 2002. It was primarily the development of Luis Argerich (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Eduardo Polidor (São Paulo, Brazil), and Garland Foster (Green Bay, WI, United States).

In July 2003, Tiki was named the SourceForge.net July 2003 Project of the Month. In late 2003, a fork of Tiki was used to create Bitweaver.

In 2006, Tiki was named to CMS Report&#x27;s Top 30 Web Applications.

In 2008, Tiki was named to EContent magazine&#x27;s Top 100

In 2009, Tiki adopted a six-month release cycle and announced the selection of a Long Term Support (LTS) version and the Tiki Software Community Association was formed as the legal steward for Tiki. The Tiki Software Association is a not-for-profit entity established in Canada. Previously, the entire project was run entirely by volunteers.

In 2010, Tiki received Best of Open Source Software Applications Award (BOSSIE) from InfoWorld, in the Applications category.

In 2011, Tiki was named to CMS Report&#x27;s Top 30 Web Applications.

In 2012, Tiki was named &quot;Best Web Tool&quot; by WebHostingSearch.com, and &quot;People&#x27;s Choice: Best Free CMS&quot; by CMS Critic.

In 2016, Tiki was named as one of the &quot;10 Best Open Source Collaboration Software Tools&quot; by Small Business Computing.

==Name==
The name &quot;TikiWiki&quot; is written in CamelCase, a common Wiki syntax indicating a hyperlink within the Wiki. It is most likely a compound word combining two Polynesian terms, &quot;Tiki&quot; and &quot;Wiki&quot;, to create a self-rhyming name similar to &quot;wikiwiki&quot;, a common variant of &quot;wiki&quot;.

A backronym has also been formed for Tiki: Tightly Integrated Knowledge Infrastructure.

== Release Information and History ==
In general, the Tiki Software Community Association releases a new major version of Tiki Wiki every 8 months where prior, non-LTS, major versions are supported until the first minor version release of the next major version (i.e., 16.0 ⇒ 17.1). Starting with version 12.x, Tiki Wiki LTS is supported for 5 years where it enters a security/maintenance release cycle upon the release of the next LTS version. Tiki Wiki&#x27;s release history is outlined below.

<doc id="421582" wikidata="Q5494630" url="?curid=421582" title="Fred Biletnikoff Award">
<text>The Fred Biletnikoff Award is presented annually to the most outstanding receiver in American college football by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. (TQCF), an independent not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization. The award was created in 1994. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State and professionally with the Oakland Raiders and Montreal Alouettes. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through a forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, though in practice, and as it has been awarded to a player at that position every year, it is considered a &quot;de facto&quot; honor for the sport&#x27;s most outstanding wide receiver. Tight end Kyle Pitts of the University of Florida was one of 3 Biletnikoff Award finalists in 2020.

A national selection committee consisting of over 600 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote. The foundation&#x27;s charitable mission is provision of scholarships to North Florida high school seniors who have overcome significant challenges to achieve at the highest levels, with 320 scholarships having been awarded through 2024 with total benefits of well over 5 million dollars. 

In December 2022, founding trustee and chairman Walter Manley II and past chairman Mark Ryan announced a goal of $10 million in aggregate to be awarded by 2030.

<doc id="421588" wikidata="Q304172" url="?curid=421588" title="Paul Farrelly">
<text>Christopher Paul Farrelly (born 2 March 1962) is a British Labour Party politician, banker and journalist, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 2001 to 2019.

==Early life==
Farrelly was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Farrelly was educated at Wolstanton Grammar School (which later became Marshlands Comprehensive High School) on Milehouse Lane in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He studied at St Edmund Hall, Oxford on a scholarship where he graduated with a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1984. After his education, he worked at managerial level in the corporate finance department with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and, in 1990 joined Reuters as a correspondent and news editor. He was appointed as the deputy business editor with the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; in 1995 before joining &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1997 as the City Editor, where he remained until his election to Westminster.

==Parliamentary career==
Before his election, Farrelly held elected office within the Hornsey and Wood Green Constituency Labour Party as well as in Newcastle-under-Lyme. He unsuccessfully contested Chesham and Amersham at the 1997 general election, finishing in third place.

Farrelly was selected to contest his hometown seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme following the retirement of the Labour MP Llin Golding at the 2001 general election, and he held the seat comfortably with a majority of 9,986. He made his maiden speech on 12 July 2001. In the House of Commons, he served on several select committees including the Science and Technology Select Committee and, from the 2005 general election, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.

A written Parliamentary question by Farrelly, answered on 19 October 2009, became the subject of debate, as &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper was prevented from reporting on it by a super-injunction.

At the 2010 general election, Farrelly was returned to parliament with a majority of 1,552. On 4 November 2010, he was involved in a physical altercation with a man during an event at the Houses of Parliament Sports and Social club, which Farrelly later said he was acting in self-defence.

Farrelly was re-elected in 2015 with a majority of 650. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

Farrelly was one of 47 Labour MPs who defied the party whip to vote against the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. The Act allowed the government to invoke Article 50, triggering the beginning of the process of British withdrawal from the European Union. Farrelly was one of 13 MPs to vote against triggering the 2017 general election. In the ensuing election, he retained his seat by just 30 votes. There was confusion in the constituency on polling day, where thousands of students were initially rejected due to errors with the electoral register.

In November 2017, the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; reported that Farrelly “launched a foul-mouthed tirade” at fellow Labour MP James Frith. Labour said it would be launching an investigation after it received &quot;a number of complaints&quot;.

In March 2018, Farrelly was accused of bullying by the former clerk of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee along with two other clerks regarding his conduct to them. An internal report into his conduct found his behaviour amounted to “an abuse of power or position, unfair treatment and undermining a competent worker by constant criticism”. A formal inquiry into the allegations was blocked by MPs and Farrelly called the accusations &#x27;baseless&#x27;.

In March 2018, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found Farrelly broke the House of Commons code of conduct by using Commons stationery during his election campaign, sending out 1000 canvassing letters in the run up to the election as if they had been sent by the House. Farrelly issued an apology and paid back the cost of the stationery.

Farrelly stood down from Parliament at the 2019 United Kingdom general election.

<doc id="421593" wikidata="Q633958" url="?curid=421593" title="Permutable prime">
<text>A permutable prime, also known as anagrammatic prime, is a prime number which, in a given base, can have its digits&#x27; positions switched through any permutation and still be a prime number. H. E. Richert, who is supposedly the first to study these primes, called them permutable primes, but later they were also called absolute primes.

== Base 2 ==
In base 2, only repunits can be permutable primes, because any 0 permuted to the ones place results in an even number. Therefore, the base 2 permutable primes are the Mersenne primes. The generalization can safely be made that for any positional number system, permutable primes with more than one digit can only have digits that are coprime with the radix of the number system. One-digit primes, meaning any prime below the radix, are always trivially permutable.

== Base 10 ==
In base 10, all the permutable primes with fewer than 49,081 digits are known
:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 113, 131, 199, 311, 337, 373, 733, 919, 991, R19 (1111111111111111111), R23, R317, R1031, R49081, ... 

Where R&quot;n&quot; := formula_1 is a repunit, a number consisting only of &quot;n&quot; ones (in base 10). Any repunit prime is a permutable prime with the above definition, but some definitions require at least two distinct digits.

Of the above, there are 16 unique permutation sets, with smallest elements
:2, 3, 5, 7, R2, 13, 17, 37, 79, 113, 199, 337, R19, R23, R317, R1031, ... 

All permutable primes of two or more digits are composed from the digits 1, 3, 7, 9, because no prime number except 2 is even, and no prime number besides 5 is divisible by 5. It is proven that no permutable prime exists which contains three different of the four digits 1, 3, 7, 9, as well as that there exists no permutable prime composed of two or more of each of two digits selected from 1, 3, 7, 9.

There is no &quot;n&quot;-digit permutable prime for 3 &lt; &quot;n&quot; &lt; 6·10175 which is not a repunit. It is conjectured that there are no non-repunit permutable primes other than the eighteen listed above. They can be split into seven permutation sets:
:{13, 31}, {17, 71}, {37, 73}, {79, 97}, {113, 131, 311}, {199, 919, 991}, {337, 373, 733}.

== Base 12 ==
In base 12, the smallest elements of the unique permutation sets of the permutable primes with fewer than 9,739 digits are known (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)
:2, 3, 5, 7, Ɛ, R2, 15, 57, 5Ɛ, R3, 117, 11Ɛ, 555Ɛ, R5, R17, R81, R91, R225, R255, R4ᘔ5, ...

There is no &quot;n&quot;-digit permutable prime in base 12 for 4 &lt; &quot;n&quot; &lt; 12144 which is not a repunit. It is conjectured that there are no non-repunit permutable primes in base 12 other than those listed above.

In base 10 and base 12, every permutable prime is a repunit or a near-repdigit, that is, it is a permutation of the integer 
&quot;P&quot;(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;xxxy&quot;&quot;b&quot; (&quot;n&quot; digits, in base &quot;b&quot;)
where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are digits which is coprime to &quot;b&quot;. Besides, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; must be also coprime (since if there is a prime &quot;p&quot; divides both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; also divides the number), so if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 1. (This is not true in all bases, but exceptions are rare and could be finite in any given base; the only exceptions below 109 in bases up to 20 are: 13911, 36A11, 24713, 78A13, 29E19 (M. Fiorentini, 2015).)

== Arbitrary bases ==

Let &quot;P(b, n, x, y)&quot; be a permutable prime in base &quot;b&quot; and let &quot;p&quot; be a prime such that &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;p&quot;. If &quot;b&quot; is a primitive root of &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;x&quot; or |&quot;x&quot; - &quot;y&quot;|, then &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of &quot;p&quot; - 1. (Since &quot;b&quot; is a primitive root mod &quot;p&quot; and &quot;p&quot; does not divide |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;|, the &quot;p&quot; numbers &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;xxxy&quot;, &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;xxyx&quot;, &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;xyxx&quot;, ..., &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;xyxx&quot;...&quot;xxxx&quot; (only the &quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot;−2 digit is &quot;y&quot;, others are all &quot;x&quot;), &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;yxxx&quot;...&quot;xxxx&quot; (only the &quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 digit is &quot;y&quot;, others are all &quot;x&quot;), &quot;xxxx&quot;...&quot;xxxx&quot; (the repdigit with &quot;n&quot; &quot;x&quot;s) mod &quot;p&quot; are all different. That is, one is 0, another is 1, another is 2, ..., the other is &quot;p&quot; − 1. Thus, since the first &quot;p&quot; − 1 numbers are all primes, the last number (the repdigit with &quot;n&quot; &quot;x&quot;s) must be divisible by &quot;p&quot;. Since &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;x&quot;, so &quot;p&quot; must divide the repunit with &quot;n&quot; 1s. Since &quot;b&quot; is a primitive root mod &quot;p&quot;, the multiplicative order of &quot;n&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; is &quot;p&quot; − 1. Thus, &quot;n&quot; must be divisible by &quot;p&quot; − 1.)

Thus, if &quot;b&quot; = 10, the digits coprime to 10 are {1, 3, 7, 9}. Since 10 is a primitive root mod 7, so if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 7, then either 7 divides &quot;x&quot; (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = 7, since &quot;x&quot; ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}) or |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;| (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 1, since &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}. That is, the prime is a repunit) or &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 7 − 1 = 6. Similarly, since 10 is a primitive root mod 17, so if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 17, then either 17 divides &quot;x&quot; (not possible, since &quot;x&quot; ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}) or |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;| (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 1, since &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}. That is, the prime is a repunit) or &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 17 − 1 = 16. Besides, 10 is also a primitive root mod 19, 23, 29, 47, 59, 61, 97, 109, 113, 131, 149, 167, 179, 181, 193, ..., so &quot;n&quot; ≥ 17 is very impossible (since for this primes &quot;p&quot;, if &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot; − 1), and if 7 ≤ &quot;n&quot; &lt; 17, then &quot;x&quot; = 7, or &quot;n&quot; is divisible by 6 (the only possible &quot;n&quot; is 12). If &quot;b&quot; = 12, the digits coprime to 12 are {1, 5, 7, 11}. Since 12 is a primitive root mod 5, so if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5, then either 5 divides &quot;x&quot; (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = 5, since &quot;x&quot; ∈ {1, 5, 7, 11}) or |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;| (in this case, either &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 1 (That is, the prime is a repunit) or &quot;x&quot; = 1, &quot;y&quot; = 11 or &quot;x&quot; = 11, &quot;y&quot; = 1, since &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ {1, 5, 7, 11}.) or &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 5 − 1 = 4. Similarly, since 12 is a primitive root mod 7, so if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 7, then either 7 divides &quot;x&quot; (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = 7, since &quot;x&quot; ∈ {1, 5, 7, 11}) or |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;| (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 1, since &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ {1, 5, 7, 11}. That is, the prime is a repunit) or &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 7 − 1 = 6. Similarly, since 12 is a primitive root mod 17, so if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 17, then either 17 divides &quot;x&quot; (not possible, since &quot;x&quot; ∈ {1, 5, 7, 11}) or |&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;| (in this case, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 1, since &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ {1, 5, 7, 11}. That is, the prime is a repunit) or &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 17 − 1 = 16. Besides, 12 is also a primitive root mod 31, 41, 43, 53, 67, 101, 103, 113, 127, 137, 139, 149, 151, 163, 173, 197, ..., so &quot;n&quot; ≥ 17 is very impossible (since for this primes &quot;p&quot;, if &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot; − 1), and if 7 ≤ &quot;n&quot; &lt; 17, then &quot;x&quot; = 7 (in this case, since 5 does not divide &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;, so &quot;n&quot; must be divisible by 4) or &quot;n&quot; is divisible by 6 (the only possible &quot;n&quot; is 12).

<text>Mark Christopher Field (born 6 October 1964) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cities of London and Westminster from 2001 to 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 2017 to 2019. A prominent supporter of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union during the Brexit referendum and of Jeremy Hunt in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, he left his post as a Foreign Office Minister when Boris Johnson&#x27;s premiership began. He stood down from the British House of Commons at the 2019 general election.

==Early life and education==
Field was born on 6 October 1964 at the British Military Hospital in Hanover, Germany. His father Peter (died 1991) was a major in the British Army and his mother Ulrike (&quot;née&quot; Peipe, died 2010) was of German origin. Field was educated at the state-funded grammar school, Reading School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in Jurisprudence in 1987.

He was secretary and national political officer of the Oxford University Conservative Association from 1985 to 1986, JCR president of St Edmund Hall in 1986, and he was also news editor of student newspaper &quot;Cherwell&quot; while it was under the editorships of Christina Lamb and Anne McElvoy. During his student days, Field set up a publishing firm after spotting a gap in the market for careers handbooks in the legal profession. He completed his education at The College of Law at Chester, qualifying as a solicitor in 1990.

==Private career==
Whilst an undergraduate at Oxford University, Field became a personal assistant to the Conservative MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, John (&quot;now&quot; Lord) Patten, before training as a solicitor and practising as a corporate lawyer with Freshfields between 1990 and 1992. He then became a director of his own lawyer employment agency, Kellyfield Consulting from 1994 until 2001; the company employed a dozen staff and turned over almost £2 million &quot;pa&quot;. After being elected to Parliament he sold his share of that business to a consortium headed by his ex-business partner.

Field served as vice-chairman of the Islington North Conservative Association between 1989 and 1991 and unsuccessfully stood as one of the Conservative Party candidates in the Quadrant ward in the Islington Council election in 1990. He was elected as a Conservative councillor for Abingdon ward on Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council in 1994, standing down in 2002 after entering the House of Commons.

He unsuccessfully contested the Conservative held seat of Enfield North at the 1997 general election following the retirement of the sitting MP Tim Eggar. 1997 was the year of Labour&#x27;s parliamentary landslide and he was defeated at that election by Labour&#x27;s Joan Ryan by 6,822 votes.

After leaving Parliament following the 2019 general election, Field was appointed as non-executive chairman of CIB Limited, a subsidiary of the Isle of Man-based investment bank Capital International Group in January 2020.

==Parliamentary career==

In December 1999 Field was selected to contest the safe Conservative seat of the Cities of London and Westminster following the retirement of former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke at the 2001 general election. Field won the seat with a majority of 4,499 and was returned to Parliament with an increased majority three times since (2005 – 8,095; 2010 – 11,076; 2015 – 9,671). He was re-elected with a reduced majority at the 2017 general election. Field made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 27 June 2001, when he declared his great political hero to be former Prime Minister Bonar Law.

He was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of the most &quot;hardline right-wingers&quot; up for election in 2001 after comments he made in 1991 about charities fighting the AIDS epidemic were reported. Field criticised AIDS campaigns as a waste of taxpayers&#x27; money and wanted mandatory tests for AIDS: &quot;Many charitable trusts set up to help counter Aids in the mid-1980s became little more than a gay rights front&quot;, he wrote in &quot;Crossbow&quot; in 1991.

As a parliamentarian Field, however, proved a strong supporter of equal rights. Within months of his election, in October 2001, he was one of four Tory MPs supporting a 10-minute rule bill on civil partnerships, a course he continued to support until it was on the statute books. He was also one of the Conservative MPs to vote in favour of gay marriage when this became law in May 2013. He was appointed an Opposition Whip by Iain Duncan Smith in 2003, becoming the Shadow Minister for London later that year. Between May and December 2005, he was Shadow Financial Secretary to HM Treasury. For 11 months, from late 2005 to late 2006, he was the Conservative Party&#x27;s spokesman on Culture, Media and Sport under the new leadership of David Cameron in 2005. During his tenure he guided Opposition policy on the National Lottery Act 2006 and promoted policy safeguarding lottery funds for its four original causes of the Arts, heritage, charities and sport. He also led opposition to Britain&#x27;s public library service.

In September 2010, Field was appointed by the Prime Minister to the Intelligence and Security Committee, chaired by former Foreign Secretary, Sir Malcolm Rifkind. He became the youngest MP on this committee, which reports directly to 10 Downing Street and oversees the UK&#x27;s intelligence and security services.

He takes a special interest in economic affairs, financial services, foreign trade and international development and is chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity as well as vice-chairman of the Groups on Football and Bangladesh. He previously served as chairman of the APPGs for Azerbaijan and Business Services. He has served on the Standing Committees of several pieces of legislation, including the Business Rates Supplements Act and the Finance Acts in 2008 and 2009.

As a backbencher, Field introduced several high-profile debates on issues of local and national importance such as homelessness, Northern Ireland, Government debt, Heathrow airport, policing in London, social housing, home education and population estimates. He has run local campaigns on business rates, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, assisting the creative industries, the control of rickshaws in the West End, social housing rent rises, the independence of the City of London Police (including its fraud detection expertise) and, in July 2011, successfully argued in Parliament for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport&#x27;s continuing control of the Royal Parks.

Field expressed criticism of the previous system governing MPs&#x27; second home allowances: &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s investigation of MPs&#x27; expenses found Field to be among the lower-end claimants.

He has been a supporter of looser rules on MPs&#x27; outside earnings and was quoted in 2001 as saying: &quot;If you&#x27;re earning several hundred thousand a year in the City, are you going to give it up for £47,000 a year in the Commons?&quot; In 2012, it was reported that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) had plans to reform MPs&#x27; pay, which could lead to them facing salary cuts for taking on second jobs. Field, who had earned £90,000 in the previous year through advisory work, called the proposals &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, especially for MPs with London costs.

In October 2011, Field voiced opposition to Occupy London protestors camped in his constituency. He expressed concern that their &quot;tent city&quot; was turning into a &quot;semi-permanent encampment&quot; which was disrupting St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, a &quot;key iconic tourist site&quot; and place of worship. He suggested that police should clear the camp at night and later said: &quot;While no one expects anti-capitalism to be a 24-hour activity, I would have hoped the protesters would show a little more respect for the sanctity of St Paul&#x27;s.&quot; On 28 February 2012, after 137 days of occupation, Field&#x27;s initial recommendation became reality following a Court order when the site was cleared by the City of London Police in just 137 minutes.

In March 2014, he launched Conservatives for Managed Migration in order to spark a &quot;calm and rational debate about migration both within and beyond the Conservative Party&quot; before the 2015 General Election. Field asserted that the Coalition Government&#x27;s pledge to get &quot;annual net migration down to the tens of thousands&quot; was undeliverable, risked potential harm to the economy and could ultimately be electorally damaging to the Conservative Party. In March 2015, Field was sworn into the Privy Council, thereafter being accorded the honorific prefix of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

In July 2015, Field was appointed vice chairman (International) of the Conservative Party under the leadership of David Cameron and was reappointed to the role by Theresa May. The role involves chairing the Party&#x27;s International and Outreach Office which builds relationships with international sister parties on the centre-right, works with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to enhance democratic institutions and political party structures in the developing world, acts as a link between the Party and its MEP group through work with the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE), and engages in political outreach work with diaspora communities in the UK.

In 2016, he met Halbe Zijlstra, Leader of the Dutch People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy in the House of Representatives, who had made a series of controversial comments about immigrants and political correctness. It was argued that Field&#x27;s role as vice chairman of the Conservative Party also includes liaising with sister centre-right parties in Europe.

=== Minister for Asia and Pacific ===
On 13 June 2017, he was appointed a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. At the FCO his formal responsibilities included: Asia, Australasia/Pacific, Communications (public diplomacy and scholarship), British Council, Economic Diplomacy (including international energy strategy; climate change; OECD relationship; fintech/cyber and the illegal wildlife trade), FCO Services Overseas and the Prosperity Fund (as FCO representative on the Ministerial board). His work on climate change has included representing the UK government at December 2018&#x27;s COP24 UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland as well as the San Francisco Climate Summit and PIF in Nauru earlier that year. He promoted UK expertise across Asia in green finance, renewables, carbon capture utilisation and storage, and electric vehicle technology.

=== Assault allegation ===
On 20 June 2019, Greenpeace accused Field of assault, after an activist who interrupted Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond&#x27;s Mansion House Speech was grabbed by the neck, pinned against a wall and then pushed out of the event by Field. Field said he reacted &quot;instinctively&quot; and referred himself to the Cabinet Office for an investigation. He apologised to the activist for &quot;grabbing her&quot; and said he was worried she might have been armed. As a result of the incident, he was suspended as a minister on 21 June, while investigations took place. The City of London Police reviewed the events and declared that it would be taking no further action. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, Field was dropped from his ministerial role at the Foreign Office as part of a cabinet reshuffle. The Whitehall investigation was closed, as he felt that it was a &quot;matter for the previous PM concerning his conduct during his time as a minister under her appointment&quot;. In October 2019, he announced that he would stand down from Parliament at the next general election, citing disagreement with government policy over Brexit.

A Cabinet Office investigation into the assault allegation, published in December 2019, concluded that he had breached the ministerial code but that he would not receive any sanction as Field was no longer in Parliament.

==Writer and commentator==

His first book, &quot;Between the Crashes&quot;, brings together his articles on UK politics and global economics following the aftermath of the financial crisis and was released by Biteback Publishing in April 2013. His second book, &quot;The Best of Times&quot; looks at the challenges and triumphs in British politics, economics and foreign affairs in the period 2013 to 2015 and was released by Biteback Publishing in May 2016. The books were co-authored with future MP Julia Lopez who was his chief of staff at the time.

Field has been a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Westminster Hour&quot; and has appeared on various other BBC television programmes, including &quot;Daily Politics&quot;, &quot;Sunday Politics&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot;, ITV&#x27;s &quot;Late Debate&quot; (a panellist from 2009) and Sky News as a newspaper reviewer. He has made contributions to the political blog, ConservativeHome, particularly on economic matters. He has written for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;City AM&quot;, and wrote an article for &quot;The Independent&quot; about the Christian minority in Syria.

==Personal life==
Field&#x27;s first wife was former investment banker Michele; they married in 1994. They divorced in 2006 following Field&#x27;s extra-marital affair between 2004 and 2005 with Liz Truss, who was also married.

In 2007, Field married celebrity agent Victoria. They have two children.

<doc id="421595" wikidata="Q6297189" url="?curid=421595" title="Joy MacPhail">
<text>Joy Kathryn MacPhail (born March 6, 1952) is a former Canadian politician in British Columbia. A longtime member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, she served as a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1991 to 2005 and as a Minister of the Crown from 1993 to 1999, and 2000–2001.

==Background==
MacPhail was born in Hamilton, Ontario. After studying economics at the University of Western Ontario, MacPhail earned a [diploma] in Labour Studies at the London School of Economics.

Prior to her election, MacPhail was a spokesperson for the B.C. Federation of Labour and an executive assistant to the Federation&#x27;s then-president, Ken Georgetti.

==Political career==
===MLA and Minister===
MacPhail was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1991 as the MLA for Vancouver-Hastings and served in the cabinets of three NDP premiers.

Under Premier Mike Harcourt, she served as Minister of Social Services from 1993 to 1996. Under Premier Glen Clark, she briefly remained Minister of Social Services, before a cabinet shuffle moved MacPhail into the position of Minister of Health from 1996 to 1998. MacPhail&#x27;s final cabinet position in the Clark government was as Minister of Finance from 1998 to her departure in 1999, leaving Clark&#x27;s cabinet at a time when it was suffering from increasing dissent and scandal.

As Finance Minister, MacPhail was tasked with delivering a deficit budget in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which caused a brief recession in British Columbia. MacPhail and the NDP opted for a Keynesian approach to the recession, investing in major construction projects like the Vancouver Trade and Convention Centre and investment in the SkyTrain network, all of which were criticized by then-opposition leader Gordon Campbell.

===Bid for party leadership===
Upon Clark&#x27;s resignation as NDP leader, MacPhail ran for the party&#x27;s leadership. MacPhail was characterized in the media as a centrist, promising a Tony Blair-style move to the Third Way and a focus on tax cuts and balanced budgets.

As fellow contender Ujjal Dosanjh consolidated more support, MacPhail withdrew from the race, throwing her support behind Dosanjh to prevent a victory by the Clark-endorsed Gordon Wilson, who was serving as Minister of Education at the time. Wilson, who had jumped from the British Columbia Liberals to the Progressive Democratic Alliance before joining the NDP, would eventually withdraw from the race and endorse Agriculture Minister Corky Evans, who would lose to Dosanjh on the first ballot. Under Dosanjh, she was the Deputy Premier and served as Minister of Labour and, later, Minister of Education.

===Final term===
The NDP suffered a massive electoral blow in the May 16, 2001, provincial election. Only MacPhail and then-Minister of the Environment, Jenny Kwan, retained their seats. MacPhail held onto her seat by 409 votes. Media noted that MacPhail&#x27;s campaign benefited from controversy surrounding her Green opponent, Ian Gregson, who had written an explicit article for Hustler Magazine in 1997.

Exactly one month after the election, MacPhail was appointed as the party&#x27;s interim leader. She was a harsh critic of the new BC Liberal premier Gordon Campbell. Although the NDP was the only other party in the legislature, it was four seats short of official party status. Despite this, Assembly speaker Claude Richmond ensured that the NDP was resourced as an opposition party and MacPhail was recognized by the speaker as the leader of the Opposition.

MacPhail stepped down as leader in 2003 and was succeeded by Carole James. She remained as parliamentary leader of the NDP until her retirement from politics after the 2005 election.

In a profile written regarding MacPhail&#x27;s retirement in 2005, the Canadian Press erroneously reported that MacPhail is the great-granddaughter of Agnes Macphail, the first woman elected to Canada&#x27;s Parliament and a founder of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, when, in fact, the two have no familial relation.

==Post-politics==
Two months after her retirement from politics, MacPhail married film and television producer James Shavick in California and became a partner in his production firm Shavick Entertainment.

In 2006, MacPhail and Shavick purchased OutTV, a Canadian cable television station focused on programming for the LGBTQ+ community. MacPhail, a long-time advocate for the community, expressed interest in producing or starring in some of the network&#x27;s programming, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s exciting, I must tell you. This is very nice next step for me!&quot;

During the 2012 NDP Leadership race, MacPhail endorsed Brian Topp.

In July 2017, once the BC NDP formed the provincial government, MacPhail replaced Barry Penner as chair of Insurance Corporation of British Columbia.

On 29 June 2022 she became chair of the board of directors at BC Ferries.

She received membership in the Order of Canada on 29 December 2021 and was given the Order of British Columbia on 1 August 2022.

<text>130 (one hundred [and] thirty) is the natural number following 129 and preceding 131.

==In mathematics==
130 is a sphenic number. It is a noncototient since there is no answer to the equation &quot;x&quot; - φ(&quot;x&quot;) = 130.

130 is the only integer that is the sum of the squares of its first four divisors, including 1: 12 + 22 + 52 + 102 = 130.

130 is the largest number that cannot be written as the sum of four hexagonal numbers.

130 equals both 27 + 2 and 53 + 5 and is therefore a &quot;doubly strictly &quot; number.

<doc id="421597" wikidata="Q16969280" url="?curid=421597" title="Tractive effort">
<text>In railway engineering, the term tractive effort describes the pulling or pushing capability of a locomotive. The published tractive force value for any vehicle may be theoretical—that is, calculated from known or implied mechanical properties—or obtained via testing under controlled conditions. The discussion herein covers the term&#x27;s usage in mechanical applications in which the final stage of the power transmission system is one or more wheels in frictional contact with a railroad track.

==Defining tractive effort==
The term &quot;tractive effort&quot; is often qualified as &quot;starting tractive effort&quot;, &quot;continuous tractive effort&quot; and &quot;maximum tractive effort&quot;. These terms apply to different operating conditions, but are related by common mechanical factors: input torque to the driving wheels, the wheel diameter, coefficient of friction () between the driving wheels and supporting surface, and the weight applied to the driving wheels (). The product of and is the factor of adhesion, which determines the maximum torque that can be applied before the onset of wheelspin or wheelslip.

; Starting tractive effort : Starting tractive effort is the tractive force that can be generated at a standstill. This figure is important on railways because it determines the maximum train weight that a locomotive can set into motion.
; Maximum tractive effort : Maximum tractive effort is defined as the highest tractive force that can be generated under any condition that is not injurious to the vehicle or machine. In most cases, maximum tractive effort is developed at low speed and may be the same as the starting tractive effort.
; Continuous tractive effort : Continuous tractive effort is the tractive force that can be maintained indefinitely, as distinct from the higher tractive effort that can be maintained for a limited period of time before the power transmission system overheats. Due to the relationship between power (), velocity () and force (), described as:

:formula_1 or formula_2

Tractive effort inversely varies with speed at any given level of available power. Continuous tractive effort is often shown in graph form at a range of speeds as part of a &quot;tractive effort curve&quot;.

Vehicles having a hydrodynamic coupling, hydrodynamic torque multiplier or electric motor as part of the power transmission system may also have a &quot;maximum continuous tractive effort&quot; rating, which is the highest tractive force that can be produced for a short period of time without causing component harm. The period of time for which the maximum continuous tractive effort may be safely generated is usually limited by thermal considerations. such as temperature rise in a traction motor.

==Tractive effort curves==

Specifications of locomotives often include tractive effort curves, showing the relationship between tractive effort and velocity.

The shape of the graph is shown at right. The line AB shows operation at the maximum tractive effort, the line BC shows continuous tractive effort that is inversely proportional to speed (constant power).

Tractive effort curves often have graphs of rolling resistance superimposed on them—the intersection of the rolling resistance graph and tractive effort graph gives the maximum velocity at zero grade (when net tractive effort is zero).

==Rail vehicles==

In order to start a train and accelerate it to a given speed, the locomotive(s) must develop sufficient tractive force to overcome the train&#x27;s resistance, which is a combination of axle bearing friction, the friction of the wheels on the rails (which is substantially greater on curved track than on tangent track), and the force of gravity if on a grade. Once in motion, the train will develop additional drag as it accelerates due to aerodynamic forces, which increase with the square of the speed. Drag may also be produced at speed due to truck (bogie) hunting, which will increase the rolling friction between wheels and rails. If acceleration continues, the train will eventually attain a speed at which the available tractive force of the locomotive(s) will exactly offset the total drag, causing acceleration to cease. This top speed will be increased on a downgrade due to gravity assisting the motive power, and will be decreased on an upgrade due to gravity opposing the motive power.

Tractive effort can be theoretically calculated from a locomotive&#x27;s mechanical characteristics (e.g., steam pressure, weight, etc.), or by actual testing with strain sensors on the drawbar and a dynamometer car. Power at rail is a railway term for the available power for traction, that is, the power that is available to propel the train.

===Steam locomotives===
An estimate for the tractive effort of a single cylinder steam locomotive can be obtained from the cylinder pressure, cylinder bore, stroke of the piston and the diameter of the wheel. The torque developed by the linear motion of the piston depends on the angle that the driving rod makes with the tangent of the radius on the driving wheel. For a more useful value an average value over the rotation of the wheel is used. The driving force is the torque divided by the wheel radius.

As an approximation, the following formula can be used (for a two-cylinder locomotive):

:formula_3 

where
* &quot;t&quot; is tractive effort in pounds-force
* &quot;d&quot; is the piston diameter in inches (bore)
* &quot;s&quot; is the piston stroke in inches
* &quot;p&quot; is the working pressure in pounds per square inch
* &quot;w&quot; is the diameter of the driving wheels in inches

The constant 0.85 was the Association of American Railroads (AAR) standard for such calculations, and overestimated the efficiency of some locomotives and underestimated that of others. Modern locomotives with roller bearings were probably underestimated.

European designers used a constant of 0.6 instead of 0.85, so the two cannot be compared without a conversion factor. In Britain main-line railways generally used a constant of 0.85 but builders of industrial locomotives often used a lower figure, typically 0.75.

The constant &quot;c&quot; also depends on the cylinder dimensions and the time at which the steam inlet valves are open; if the steam inlet valves are closed immediately after obtaining full cylinder pressure the piston force can be expected to have dropped to less than half the initial force. giving a low &quot;c&quot; value. If the cylinder valves are left open for longer the value of &quot;c&quot; will rise nearer to one.

;Three or four cylinders (simple)
The result should be multiplied by 1.5 for a three-cylinder locomotive and by two for a four-cylinder locomotive.

Alternatively, tractive effort of all &quot;simple&quot; (i.e. non-compound) locomotives can be calculated thus:

formula_4 

where
* &quot;t&quot; is tractive effort in pounds-force
* &quot;n&quot; is the number of cylinders
* &quot;d&quot; is the piston diameter in inches
* &quot;s&quot; is the piston stroke in inches
* &quot;p&quot; is the maximum rated boiler pressure in psi
* &quot;w&quot; is the diameter of the driving wheels in inches
;Multiple cylinders (compound)
For other numbers and combinations of cylinders, including double and triple expansion engines the tractive effort can be estimated by adding the tractive efforts due to the individual cylinders at their respective pressures and cylinder strokes.

====Values and comparisons for steam locomotives====

Tractive effort is the figure often quoted when comparing the powers of steam locomotives, but is misleading because tractive effort shows the ability to start a train, not the ability to haul it. Possibly the highest tractive effort ever claimed was for the Virginian Railway&#x27;s 2-8-8-8-4 triplex locomotive, which in simple expansion mode had a calculated starting T.E. of 199,560 lbf (887.7 kN)—but the boiler could not produce enough steam to haul at speeds over 5 mph (8 km/h).

Of more successful steam locomotives, those with the highest rated starting tractive effort were the Virginian Railway AE-class 2-10-10-2s, at 176,000 lbf (783 kN) in simple-expansion mode (or 162,200 lb if calculated by the usual formula). The Union Pacific Big Boys had a starting T.E. of 135,375 lbf (602 kN); the Norfolk &amp; Western&#x27;s Y5, Y6, Y6a, and Y6b class 2-8-8-2s had a starting T.E. of 152,206 lbf (677 kN) in simple expansion mode (later modified to 170,000 lbf (756 kN), claim some enthusiasts); and the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s freight duplex Q2 attained 114,860 lbf (510.9 kN, including booster)—the highest for a rigid-framed locomotive. Later two-cylinder passenger locomotives were generally 40,000 to 80,000 lbf (170 to 350 kN) of T.E.

===Diesel and electric locomotives===
For an electric locomotive or a diesel-electric locomotive, starting tractive effort can be calculated from the amount of weight on the driving wheels (which may be less than the total locomotive weight in some cases), combined stall torque of the traction motors, the gear ratio between the traction motors and axles, and driving wheel diameter. For a diesel-hydraulic locomotive, the starting tractive effort is affected by the stall torque of the torque converter, as well as gearing, wheel diameter and locomotive weight.

The relationship between power and tractive effort was expressed by Hay (1978) as

:formula_5 

where
* &quot;t&quot; is tractive effort, in newtons (N)
* &quot;P&quot; is the power in watts (W)
* &quot;E&quot; is the efficiency, with a suggested value of 0.82 to account for losses between the motor and the rail, as well as power diverted to auxiliary systems such as lighting
* &quot;v&quot; is the speed in metres per second (m/s)

Freight locomotives are designed to produce higher maximum tractive effort than passenger units of equivalent power, necessitated by the much higher weight that is typical of a freight train. In modern locomotives, the gearing between the traction motors and axles is selected to suit the type of service in which the unit will be operated. As traction motors have a maximum speed at which they can rotate without incurring damage, gearing for higher tractive effort is at the expense of top speed. Conversely, the gearing used with passenger locomotives favors speed over maximum tractive effort.

Electric locomotives with monomotor bogies are sometimes fitted with two-speed gearing. This allows higher tractive effort for hauling freight trains but at reduced speed. Examples include the SNCF classes BB 8500 and BB 25500.

<text>Mark Fisher (born 29 October 1944) is a British Labour Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stoke-on-Trent Central from 1983 to 2010 and Minister for the Arts between 1997 and 1998.

==Early life==
Mark Fisher is the son of Sir Nigel Fisher, the former Conservative MP for Surbiton and Lady Gloria Vaughan, daughter of the 7th Earl of Lisburne. He is the stepson of Ulster Unionist MP Patricia Ford, and thus the brother-in-law of Conservative MP Sir Michael Grylls and uncle of explorer Bear Grylls.

Following the retirement of Tam Dalyell in 2005, Fisher became the only Labour MP to have been educated at Eton College. He read English literature at Trinity College, Cambridge. After completing his education in 1966, he became a film producer and screenwriter, but in 1975 Fisher became the principal of the Tattenhall Centre of Education in Cheshire, where he remained until his election to Westminster.

Before leaving university, Fisher had numerous low-paying jobs, including: working in a Cyril Lord carpet factory in Northern Ireland, as a waiter, as a kitchen porter, as a caddie on a golf course, insulating roofs, on a travelling fairground and as a folk singer and guitarist.

His film work consisted of writing screenplays for Harry Saltzman and two stage plays: in 1974 for the new Arts Council Horseshoe Theatre in Basingstoke and, in 1988, for the Theatre Upstairs, at the Royal Court in London.

==Political career==
Fisher unsuccessfully contested Leek at the 1979 general election but was defeated by David Knox by 10,571 votes. He was elected as a councillor to the Staffordshire County Council in 1981 and remained a councillor until he stood down in 1985.

He was elected as an MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central at the 1983 general election following the retirement of the sitting Labour MP Robert Cant. Fisher held the seat with a majority of 8,250.

In parliament, Fisher served on the Treasury Select committee for three years from 1983. In 1985 he was appointed as an Opposition Whip by Neil Kinnock for a year in 1985. Following the 1987 General Election he became the opposition spokesman on arts and media and following the 1992 general election he became the spokesman on the Citizen&#x27;s Charter, a year later in 1993, however, he was back as a spokesman at the newly named Department of National Heritage. In 1992 he introduced the &quot;Right to Know Bill&quot;, a Private member&#x27;s bill, which, though unsuccessful, became the forerunner of the Freedom of Information Bill.

Following the Labour victory at the 1997 general Election, new prime minister Tony Blair appointed Fisher as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. He rebelled against the government by voting against the party whip on the Competition Act 1998, and was later sacked in Blair&#x27;s first cabinet reshuffle in 1998, after which Fisher returned to the backbenches.

He has served as the Patron for the National Benevolent Fund for the Aged since 1986, and was a member of the BBC General Advisory Council for ten years from 1987. He also served as a council member of the Institute for Policy Studies 1985–95, and was the deputy Pro-Chancellor of Keele University from 1989 until his entry to government in 1997. In 2000 he was a visiting fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

In June 2009, Fisher called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown to resign. In the expenses scandal he claimed more than £17,000, none of which he was required to pay back. The bulk of this sum was spent on mortgage and utility payments on his second home. Some of his more bizarre expenses claims include a 34-pence Kit Kat bar, a bottle of Toilet Duck and a pack of chunky crayons and face-painting kit.

On 10 March 2010, Fisher announced that he would stand down as an MP due to health concerns, citing hydrocephalus. He was succeeded as MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central by Tristram Hunt, who was also educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.

===Political views===
On 31 October 2006, Fisher was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.

He opposed foundation hospitals and the Trident system, voting against these issues in the House of Commons. He also opposed the 42-day detention without charge policy and the 10p tax.

Fisher believes that Parliament has become too much of a rubber stamp for government policy. He chaired the &quot;Parliament First&quot; group, which seeks to restore the balance of power to Parliament.

His particular interest of the arts led him to criticize the Blair administration for what he called its obsession with &quot;popular music, youth culture and new technologies&quot; and &quot;art created for and by young people&quot;; instead he wished for a more &quot;balanced&quot; cultural policy.

In 2014, he co-wrote with academic Jeremy Gilbert the publication &quot;Reclaim Modernity: Beyond Markets, Beyond Machines&quot;.

==Personal life==
Fisher married Ingrid Geech Hunt in 1971 and fathered two children, Rhydian Fisher and the actress India Fisher, as well as taking over the upbringing of Hunt&#x27;s two children by her previous marriage, the musician Crispin Hunt and the actress Francesca Hunt (no relation to his constituency successor.) The couple divorced in 1999. He lived briefly with Candia McWilliam.

Fisher has lived in the Stoke-on-Trent district of Hartshill since first running for Parliament.

Fisher refused the offer of a peerage ahead of the 2001 General Election.

Fisher&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Museums and Galleries&quot; listed what were, in his opinion, the 350 best museums in the country.

In October 2009, it was revealed that Fisher received an annual fee of £67,000 from the Doha-based Qatar Museums Authority for providing &quot;advice on the development of the museums authority&#x27;s plans&quot;, attending three board meetings a year.

<doc id="421601" wikidata="Q1241240" url="?curid=421601" title="Royal Exchange, London">
<text>The Royal Exchange in London was founded in the 16th century by the merchant Sir Thomas Gresham on the suggestion of his factor Richard Clough to act as a centre of commerce for the City of London. The site was provided by the City of London Corporation and the Worshipful Company of Mercers, who still jointly own the freehold. The original foundation was ceremonially opened by Queen Elizabeth I who granted it its &quot;royal&quot; title. The current neoclassical building has a trapezoidal floor plan and is flanked by Cornhill and Threadneedle Street, which converge at Bank junction in the heart of the city. It lies in the Ward of Cornhill.
The exchange building has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt. The present building was designed by Sir William Tite in the 1840s. The site was notably occupied by the Lloyd&#x27;s insurance market for nearly 150 years. Today, the Royal Exchange contains restaurants and luxury shops.

Traditionally, the steps of the Royal Exchange are the place where certain royal proclamations (such as the dissolution of parliament) are read out by either a herald or a crier. Following the death or abdication of a monarch and the confirmation of the next monarch&#x27;s accession to the throne by the Accession Council, the Royal Exchange Building is one of the locations where a herald proclaims the new monarch&#x27;s reign to the public.

==History==
Richard Clough initially suggested building the exchange in 1562, and its original design was inspired by the Antwerp bourse, the world&#x27;s first purpose-built bourse, with which Thomas Gresham, the representative of the English crown in Antwerp, was familiar, and on which the designs of the bourses of Amsterdam (1611) and Rotterdam would also be based.

It was Britain&#x27;s first specialist commercial building, and Clough oversaw the importing of some of the materials from Antwerp: stone, slate, wainscot and glass, for which he paid thousands of pounds himself. The Royal Exchange was officially opened on 23 January 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I, who awarded the building its royal title and a licence to sell alcohol and valuable goods. Only the exchange of goods took place until the 17th century. Stockbrokers were not allowed into the Royal Exchange because of their rude manners, hence they had to operate from other establishments in the vicinity, such as Jonathan&#x27;s Coffee-House. Gresham&#x27;s original building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. 

A second complex was built on the site, designed by Edward Jarman and opened in 1669. It featured a tall wooden tower over the south entrance in Corn Hill; this eventually fell into disrepair and, in 1821, was replaced by a new stone tower and cupola designed by George Smith. The second Exchange was also burned down on 10 January 1838 in a fire caused by an overheated stove; the blaze was visible from Windsor, away. It had been used by the Lloyd&#x27;s insurance market, which was forced to move temporarily to South Sea House following the 1838 fire.
===Current building===
The third Royal Exchange building, which still stands today, was designed by Sir William Tite and adheres to the original layout–consisting of a four-sided structure surrounding a central courtyard where merchants and tradesmen could do business. The internal works, designed by Edward I&#x27;Anson in 1837, made use of concrete—an early example of this modern construction method. It features pediment sculptures by Richard Westmacott (the younger), and ornamental cast ironwork by Henry Grissell&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Canal Ironworks. It was opened by Queen Victoria on 28 October 1844, though trading did not commence until 1 January 1845.

Paul Julius Reuter established the Reuters news agency at 1, Royal Exchange Buildings (opposite and to the east of the Royal Exchange) in 1851. It later moved to Fleet Street.

===Portico and pediment===
The western end of the building consists of a portico of eight Corinthian columns topped by a pediment containing a tympanum with relief sculpture by Richard Westmacott (the younger) of seventeen figures representing London merchants and foreign traders. The central allegorical figure represents Commerce, above an inscription chosen by Albert, Prince Consort from Psalm 24: &quot;The Earth is the Lord&#x27;s, and the fulness thereof&quot;. The Latin inscription on the frieze states:

or &quot;founded in the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, and restored in the eighth of Queen Victoria&quot;.

===Statues===
Two statues stand in niches in the central courtyard. &quot;Charles II&quot; (a copy of 1792 by John Spiller after Grinling Gibbons&#x27; statue in the centre of the 17th century courtyard) and &quot;Queen Elizabeth I&quot; by Musgrave Watson, 1844. The Charles II statue survived the fire of 1838 that destroyed the previous Exchange. The Elizabeth I statue was commissioned as she was the monarch who had conferred the status &quot;Royal&quot; on the Exchange.

In front of the portico of the Royal Exchange is a statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the last work of Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey. The bronze used to cast it was donated by the government and sourced from French cannons captured during the Napoleonic Wars. It was unveiled on 18 June 1844, the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, in the presence of the King of Saxony.

Between the Wellington statue and the exchange steps is the London Troops Memorial commemorating the dead of military units associated with the City and County of London during the First World War. Designed by Sir Aston Webb, the monument is flanked by two bronze statues of soldiers and surmounted by a lion, all sculpted by Alfred Drury. It was unveiled on 12 November 1920 in the presence of the Duke of York, later King George VI.

===The Gresham Grasshopper===
The golden Gresham Grasshopper is the Royal Exchange&#x27;s weathervane and was the crest of the founder, Sir Thomas Gresham. According to legend, a grasshopper&#x27;s chirps once led to the discovery of a foundling, who became the first of the house of Gresham and the ancestor of Sir Thomas Gresham. The Grasshopper weathervane was rescued from the 1838 fire and is long. It stands above street level on a clock tower which has a clock by Edward John Dent. A similar grasshopper weathervane on the Faneuil Hall in Boston, Massachusetts was made by Shem Drowne in 1742 and was inspired by the London example.

===Bells===
The tower contains a chime of 15 bells all cast by Charles and George Mears of Whitechapel in 1844, with a mechanism that can play God Save the King, The Roast Beef of Old England, Rule Britannia! and Psalm 104. The combined weight of them is . The original plan was to have the same number of bells as before the fire (nine) but was increased to 15 at the suggestion of Edward John Dent, who, having visited Brussels to obtain information as to the arrangement of carillons, was convinced to recommend that the number so that a greater range of tunes could be played. Professor Taylor advised the committee to increase them to fifteen, which would then allow of playing in three octaves. The largest is also the hour bell, and bears the following inscription &quot;&quot;Cast for the Royal Exchange in the year of grace 1844; Richard Lambert Jones, Chairman of the Gresham College Committee; Daniel Watney, Master of the Mercers&#x27; Company; Ebenezer Trottman, Assistant; William Tite, Architect; Charles and George Mears, founders.&quot; The others only bear the words &quot;Royal Exchange, 1844&quot;.&quot;

===Murals===
From 1892, twenty-four scenes from London&#x27;s history were painted on the first-floor walls by artists including Sir Frederic Leighton, Sir Frank Brangwyn and Stanhope Forbes. The murals run as a sequence:

With the outbreak of the Second World War, trading at the Royal Exchange virtually ended. At war&#x27;s end, the building had survived the Blitz, albeit with some near misses.

==Modern use==
In 1982 the Royal Exchange was in disrepair – in particular, the glass roof was in danger of collapse. The newly formed London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) was the main tenant, using the courtyard for the trading floor, all done without touching the framework of the original building. Liffe moved to Cannon Bridge in 1991.

In 2001 the Royal Exchange (interiors and courtyard) was once again extensively remodelled, this time by architects Aukett Fitzroy Robinson. The works involved the restoration of the fabric of the building, a two floor office extension and replacement of the roof above the courtyard.

In a lane by the eastern entrance to the Royal Exchange, stand two statues: one of Paul Julius Reuter who founded his news agency there, and one of George Peabody who founded the Peabody Trust and a business which became J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.

In 2013 a lease of Royal Exchange was sold by Anglo Irish Bank to Oxford Properties, a Canadian property company. It had been announced that the site would be sold with a 104-year lease. Oxford Properties Group, a division of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, bought the retail centre for a reported £86.5 million. In October 2022, Ardent UK acquired the retail element of the Exchange from Oxford Properties Group for around £50 million.

<text>The Atlantic Theatre Festival (ATF) was a professional theatre company located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. The Theatre Festival presented a &quot;broad range of critically acclaimed theatre classics&quot; during the summer in Wolfville&#x27;s Festival Theatre, the former town hockey arena that was converted into a 504 seat, thrust stage theatre and professional production facility by the Atlantic Theatre Festival Society (a non-profit charity).

==History==
Over two million dollars was contributed by the local, Nova Scotian, and Canadian governments to create the Festival Theatre. Stratford Festival veteran Michael Langham was among the directors who brought national acclaim to the festival during the Founder&#x27;s Season of 1995. The reputation of the festival grew over the following seasons as it attracted the likes of Megan Follows, Christopher Plummer, and area native Peter Donat to join its company. In later years, despite originally being conceived as a classical repertory, the festival maintained its critical success as it began to include works by Canadian playwrights as well as family-friendly musicals.

Despite a strong critical reputation, mounting debts over the first five years forced the Atlantic Theatre Festival to reduce cast sizes, lay-off crew, and cancel productions. The construction of the Festival Theatre initially came as a result of a twenty-year (dollar-a-year) lease from Acadia University. In 2002, this agreement was terminated and a new lease was offered that reduced the professional theatre company to a seasonal tenant. This arrangement threatened the Atlantic Theatre Festival&#x27;s existence, causing the cancellation of the 2004 season. The festival theatre stage remained dark in 2005, but had a successful renewal in 2006. With one main stage production and comedic readings to form the &quot;Summer of Laughter&quot; season both audiences and tourists returned. The financial success did not continue the following season as the festival returned to a multi-play format. In August 2007, artistic director Nigel Bennett was forced to resign mid-season after the Board of Directors informed him that sufficient funds were not available to continue. One production completed its run while two others, one on stage and the other in rehearsal, were cancelled. A lack of funding from both provincial and federal levels was named as the main cause of the closure.

Currently, the Festival Theatre is used for the Acadia University Performing Arts Series, which are held throughout the University school year, and for conferences.

<doc id="421616" wikidata="Q4018383" url="?curid=421616" title="Washington Generals">
<text>The Washington Generals are an American basketball team who play exhibition games against the Harlem Globetrotters. The team has also played under several aliases in their history as the Globetrotters&#x27; perennial opponents.

==Function==

The Generals exist primarily as a part of the Harlem Globetrotters&#x27; act, effectively being stooges for the Globetrotters. While the Globetrotters play tricks and perform spectacular displays of skill for the crowd, the Generals attempt to play a &quot;normal&quot; game of basketball. The Generals&#x27; games involve playing genuine basketball at times, but also not interfering in the Globetrotters&#x27; tricks. Almost every game has ended in a resounding win for the Globetrotters. Despite their losses, the Generals&#x27; roster consists of competent players. A recurring part of the act is the &quot;guest General&quot;, where, for a short period, an invited person (usually a local celebrity) comes on court to play for the Generals. There can exist multiple teams of Generals simultaneously, each following different touring Globetrotters teams. 

While the Generals are closely associated with the Globetrotters, they were, for most of their history, an independent franchise owned by their founder, Louis &quot;Red&quot; Klotz, who also played on the Generals. In 2017 they were purchased from the Klotz family by Globetrotters&#x27; owners Herschend Entertainment and officially revived from a two-year hiatus.

==History==
The Generals were created in 1952 by Louis &quot;Red&quot; Klotz, a former player for the Philadelphia Sphas, a former ABL team that became one of the Globetrotters&#x27; exhibition rivals. Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein had invited Klotz to create a squad to accompany his team on their tours, in part because the Sphas had beaten the Globetrotters on more than one occasion while serving as one of the Globetrotters&#x27; exhibition teams. With a nod to Dwight D. Eisenhower, the team was named the Washington Generals. 

The Generals remained a continuous presence in the Globetrotters act from then on, but to give the illusion of variety they played under a variety of different names with changes of uniform. During the 1971–72 season, the Generals&#x27; name was alternated with the &quot;Boston Shamrocks&quot;, &quot;New Jersey Reds&quot;, &quot;Baltimore Rockets&quot;, and &quot;Atlantic City Seagulls&quot;. The team rotated between these identities for a few seasons before going back to the Generals identity full-time. In 1995 Klotz &quot;disbanded&quot; the Generals and formed the &quot;New York Nationals&quot; which again was only a nominal change.
John Ferrari, the son-in-law of Klotz, took over as general manager of the team in 1987.

After a 12-year hiatus, the team returned to their Generals identity on October 9, 2007, playing against the Globetrotters at the 369th Harlem Armory. The Globetrotters won 54–50. The monikers of &quot;International Elite&quot; and the &quot;Global Select&quot; were adopted prior to the 2011–12 World Tour. For the 2013–14 Harlem Globetrotters World Tour, the team took on the moniker of the &quot;World All-Stars&quot;.

The Generals would occasionally play teams other than the Globetrotters. Among these games, which were competitive, they managed to record victories against the Taiwanese national team and a low-level Red Army team.

In 2015, the Harlem Globetrotters management chose to end contractual relations with the Generals organization, resulting in the Generals ceasing operations. The Generals played their last game against the Globetrotters on August 1, 2015, in Wildwood, New Jersey. Overall, the Generals had lost to the Globetrotters more than 16,000 times in their combined history while winning a mere 3–6 games.

From 2015 the Globetrotters&#x27; opposition was organised by their own management. In 2017, Herschend Family Entertainment, the owners of the Harlem Globetrotters, bought the Washington Generals from the Klotz family and revived them as an active team with Kenny Smith as general manager and Sam Worthen as coach. The Generals held a tongue-in-cheek &quot;draft&quot; where they selected various unavailable persons including LaVar Ball and Conor McGregor. As a reintroduction for the team, they were entered in ESPN&#x27;s The Basketball Tournament 2017. Despite having a rare opportunity to play serious, competitive basketball, their long losing run continued with a first round loss.

==Beating the Harlem Globetrotters==

Figures vary as to exactly how often the Generals have beaten their rivals. Some reports say six, while the team&#x27;s official website reports having three victories over the Globetrotters, one each in 1954, 1958 and 1971. The 1971 win is the most storied of these and is sometimes reported as the team&#x27;s sole victory.

Playing as the New Jersey Reds, they won 100–99 on January 5, 1971, in Martin, Tennessee, ending their 2,495-game losing streak. Klotz credits the overtime win to a guard named Eddie Mahar, who was team captain. Harlem&#x27;s captain, Curly Neal, did not play in this game.

While the Globetrotters were entertaining the crowd that day, they lost track of the game and the score. They found themselves down 12 points with two minutes left to go. Forced to play normal basketball, the Globetrotters rallied but could not recover. 

The Reds secured their victory when the 50-year-old Klotz hit the winning basket with seconds left. Then, Meadowlark Lemon missed a shot that would have given the game back to the Globetrotters. The timekeeper tried to stop the clock but could not. When the final buzzer sounded, the crowd was dumbfounded and disappointed. Klotz described the fans&#x27; reaction: &quot;They looked at us like we killed Santa Claus.&quot;

Some children in the stands cried after the loss. The Reds celebrated by dousing themselves with orange soda instead of champagne. Lemon was furious, saying, &quot;You lost, I didn&#x27;t lose&quot;, but still visited the opposing team’s locker room to congratulate the Reds.

Very rarely Washington Generals players have been &quot;promoted&quot; to the Globetrotters. Derick &quot;Dizzy&quot; Grant was transferred in 2010, and Jonte &quot;Too Tall&quot; Hall made the transition in 2011.

Paul Sturgess made the opposite transition. The former Globetrotter, after a few seasons playing for other teams, transferred back into the setup as part of the arranged opposition. The Sturgess adopted the persona of &quot;Cager&quot;, a masked adversary who adopts a villainous role.

<doc id="421620" wikidata="Q1234410" url="?curid=421620" title="Howard Flight">
<text>Howard Emerson Flight, Baron Flight (born 16 June 1948) is a Conservative politician in the United Kingdom and a member of the House of Lords who was Member of Parliament for Arundel and South Downs from 1997 to 2005. He held several Shadow posts: Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 1999 to 2001, Shadow Paymaster General from 2001 to 2002, and Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2004.

== Early and personal life ==
Flight was educated at Brentwood School, Magdalene College, Cambridge and the University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business. From 1970 to 1998 he worked as an investment adviser and director in various banks. Flight is author of &quot;All you Need to know about Exchange Rates&quot; (1989), and contributor to the book &quot;The City in Europe and the World&quot; (2005). He has been married to Christabel since 1974; they have four children: Kitty, Thomas, Josie and Maryanne. His wife, entitled to be known as Lady Flight, was previously a councillor representing Warwick ward on Westminster City Council, and served as Lord mayor of Westminster.

== Political career ==
Flight stood unsuccessfully for Parliament for Bermondsey in the February and October 1974 general elections.

He resigned as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party on 24 March 2005, following comments made at a Conservative Way Forward meeting that was being secretly recorded. In the meeting he stated that the Conservatives in office could make more spending cuts than they were promising in their campaign (including in their manifesto) before the general election. Conservative leader Michael Howard that month withdrew the party whip, and announced that Flight was no longer an approved candidate and could not contest the Arundel and South Downs seat as a Conservative party candidate at the 2005 general election. Flight refused to accept this, maintaining that only his constituency Conservative Association had the power to deselect its candidate. On 29 March 2005 he announced that he had an opinion from a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (an eminent barrister) confirming this view. The Arundel and South Downs Conservative Association initially refused to seek a new candidate, but it reversed its position when Conservative Central Office threatened it with the &quot;Slough treatment&quot;, referring to the suspension of that association for refusing to deselect Adrian Hilton. Amid speculation, Flight confirmed that he would not stand as an independent and would not oppose any decision by the Association to deselect him.

=== Elections ===
On 6 April, Flight was deselected as a Conservative candidate by then-party leader Michael Howard, and removed from his role as party deputy chairman, and his party began the process of selecting a new last-minute candidate. Anne Marie Morris, Laura Sandys, and Nick Herbert put themselves forward for nomination as replacement candidates. The chosen candidate, Nick Herbert, won the seat at the election.

Some years later, after a change of party leader, Flight was placed on the A-List of Conservative Party candidates available to fight the 2010 general election, but in the event he was one of minority on that list not selected as a candidate in open primaries and/or with party recommendation. On 19 November 2010, it was announced that Flight was to be created a life peer and would sit as a Conservative in the House of Lords. His full title, created 13 January 2011, is Baron Flight, of Worcester in the County of Worcestershire.

On 25 November 2010, a week after the announcement of his intended peerage, Flight apologised after suggesting that the government&#x27;s changes to child benefits would &quot;discourage the middle classes from breeding, but for those on benefits there is every incentive&quot;.

=== Peerage received and other roles===
Flight was raised to the peerage in January 2011. He is a director of companies, including Investec, a venture capital company, his own private equity company, and is chairman of the Entrepreneurs Investment Scheme (EIS) Association of lawyers and accountants, a trustee and Vice President of the Elgar Foundation, a Member of the Advisory Boards of the Centre for Policy Studies, Institute of Economic Affairs and Financial Services Forum.

<doc id="421624" wikidata="Q723956" url="?curid=421624" title="Joel Roberts Poinsett">
<text>Joel Roberts Poinsett (March 2, 1779December 12, 1851) was an American physician, botanist, politician, and diplomat. He was the first U.S. agent in South America, a member of the South Carolina Legislature in the South Carolina State Capitol, at the state capital town of Columbia, and later a United States Representative (congressman) in the U.S. House of Representatives (the lower chamber of the Congress of the United States), serving 1821–1825. He was appointed by 6th President, John Quincy Adams as the first United States Minister to Mexico (ambassador), He replaced U.S. Army General James Wilkinson (1757–1825), who had been in the Royal Spanish colony of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (of Mexico) as an envoy for a decade, 1816–1825. Minister Poinsett served 1825–1829. (continuing into the first year of the successor Andrew Jackson presidential administration). Mexico had recently declared its independence in 1821, and formed a new brief provisional government then later as the First Mexican Empire (1823–1824), (Mexico), from the Kingdom of Spain and its longtime colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain, in the Americas portion of the world-wide Spanish Empire. He served to represent the American government during his term to the subsequent another Mexican provisional interim government and then following the First Mexican Republic regime in a tumultuous period of their history in their capital city of Mexico City.

Poinsett was a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson during the early to mid-19th century in favor of his policies of Jacksonian democracy. He was Unionist leader in South Carolina during that state&#x27;s threatened refusal to accept and enforce certain federal laws and tariff levies on imported goods in the earlier secessionist rebellion of the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s. Jackson threatened in return to subdue by military force if necessary the rebellious southern &quot;Palmetto State&quot;, during the presidential administration of 7th President Andrew Jackson (1767–1845, served 1829–1837).

Poinsett was subsequently appointed 15th U.S. Secretary of War in the Presidential Cabinet under Jackson&#x27;s successor, 8th President, Martin Van Buren (1782–1862, served 1837–1841), of New York state, supervising the U.S. Department of War and its military forces of the United States Army.

He was a co-founder of the earlier National Institute for the Promotion of Science and the Useful Arts in the 1840s, (a predecessor of the modern Smithsonian Institution, endowed by James Smithson (1765–1829, a British scientist - chemist / mineralogist), and its system of museums and cultural / scientific agencies in Washington, D.C. and New York City).

==Early life==
Joel Roberts Poinsett was born in 1779 in Charleston, South Carolina, to a wealthy physician, Elisha Poinsett, and his wife Katherine Ann Roberts. He was educated in Connecticut and University of Edinburgh, gaining expertise in languages, the law, and military affairs.

===Touring in Europe===
In 1800 Poinsett returned to Charleston hoping to pursue a military career. His father did not want his son to be a soldier. Hoping to entice his son to settle into the Charleston aristocracy, Poinsett had his son study law under Henry William DeSaussure, a prominent lawyer of Charleston. Poinsett was not interested in becoming a lawyer, and convinced his parents to allow him to go on an extended tour of Europe in 1801. DeSaussure sent with him a list of law books including Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; and Burn&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical Law&quot;, just in case young Poinsett changed his mind regarding the practice of law.

Beginning in 1801, Poinsett traveled the European continent. In the spring of 1802, Poinsett left France for Italy traveling through the Alps and Switzerland. He visited the cities of Naples and hiked up Mount Etna on the island of Sicily. In the spring of 1803 he arrived in Switzerland and stayed at the home of Jacques Necker and his daughter, Madame de Stael. Necker, French Finance Minister from 1776 to 1781 under Louis XVI, had been driven into exile by Napoleon I.

On one occasion, Robert Livingston, the United States minister to France, was invited for a visit while he was touring Savoy, France, and Switzerland. Poinsett was compelled to assume the role of interpreter between the deaf Livingston and the aged Necker, whose lack of teeth made his speech almost incomprehensible. Fortunately, Madame de Stael tactfully assumed the duty of translation for her elderly father.

In October 1803, Poinsett left Switzerland for Vienna, Austria, and from there journeyed to Munich. In December he received word that his father was dead, and that his sister, Susan, was seriously ill. He immediately secured passage back to Charleston. Poinsett arrived in Charleston early in 1804, months after his father had been laid to rest. Hoping to save his sister&#x27;s life, Poinsett took her on a voyage to New York, remembering how his earlier voyage to Lisbon had intensified his recovery. Yet, upon arriving in New York City, Susan Poinsett died. As the sole remaining heir, Poinsett inherited a small fortune in town houses and lots, plantations, bank stock, and &quot;English funds.&quot; The entire Poinsett estate was valued at a hundred thousand dollars or more.

===Travel in Russia===

Poinsett arrived in the Russian capital of St. Petersburg in November 1806. Levett Harris, consul of the United States at St. Petersburg, and the highest American official in the country, hoped to introduce Poinsett at court to Czar Alexander. Learning that Poinsett was from South Carolina, the Empress asked him if he would inspect the cotton factories under her patronage. Poinsett and Consul Harris traveled by sleigh to Cronstadt to see the factories. Poinsett made some suggestions on improvement, which the Dowager Empress accepted. Poinsett did not believe the cotton industry could be successful in Russia because of the necessity of employing serfs who received no compensation and therefore could have no interest in its prosperity. Furthermore, he believed that the institution of serfdom made it difficult for Russia to have a merchant marine or become industrialized.

In January 1807, Czar Alexander and Poinsett dined at the Palace. Czar Alexander attempted to entice Poinsett into the Russian civil or military service. Poinsett was hesitant, which prompted Alexander to advise him to &quot;see the Empire, acquire the language, study the people&quot;, and then decide. Always interested in travel, Poinsett accepted the invitation and left St. Petersburg in March 1807 on a journey through southern Russia. He was accompanied by his English friend Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston and eight others.

With letters recommending them to the special care of all Russian officials, Poinsett and Royston made their way to Moscow. They were among the last westerners to see Moscow before its burning in October 1812 by Napoleon&#x27;s forces. From Moscow they traveled to the Volga River, and then by boat to Astrakhan, situated at the mouth of the river. Poinsett&#x27;s company now entered the Caucasus, containing a very diverse population, and only recently acquired by Russia through conquests by Czars Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. Because of ethnic conflict, the area was extremely dangerous. They were provided with a Cossack escort as they traveled between Tarki and Derbent in Dagestan, but when a Tartar dignitary claimed that this would only provoke danger, the escort was bypassed for the security of the Tartar chiefs. This new security increased the numbers in Poinsett&#x27;s company, which they believed made it less vulnerable to attack as it passed out of Russia proper. Thus, they were joined by a Persian merchant, who was transporting young girls he had acquired in Circassia to Baku, Azerbaijan and harems in Turkey. With a strong Persian and Kopak guard, the party left Derbent and entered the realm of the Khan of Kuban.

While traveling through the Khanate, a tribal chief stole some of the horses in Poinsett&#x27;s party. Poinsett boldly decided to go out of his way to the court of the Khan in the town of Kuban to demand their return. As there were normally never any foreigners in this place, the Khan was surprised. Of course, he had never heard of the United States, and Poinsett did the best he could to answer all the questions the Khan had. In order to convey the greatness of the U.S., Poinsett spoke at length on its geography. The Khan referred to President Thomas Jefferson as the Shah of America. Finally, Poinsett stated that the theft of his horses would reflect badly on the fair name of the Khanate. The Khan was impressed and told Poinsett that the head of the guilty chief was his for the asking, yet since the thief had made it possible for him to accept such a distinguished visitor, perhaps a pardon might be in order.

Poinsett&#x27;s company traveled to Baku on the Caspian Sea. He noted that because of the petroleum pits in the region, it had long been a spot of pilgrimage for fire-worshipers. He became one of the earliest U.S. travelers to the Middle East, where, in 1806, the Persian khan showed him a pool of petroleum, which he speculated might someday be used for fuel.

Attracted by the military movements in the Caucasus Mountains, Poinsett visited Erivan, which was then besieged by the Russian Army. After a time with the troops, Poinsett and company journeyed through the mountains of Armenia to the Black Sea. Avoiding Constantinople because of conflict between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, the party proceeded to the Crimea, then through Ukraine, reaching Moscow late in 1807. The trip had been hazardous and Poinsett&#x27;s health was much impaired. Furthermore, of the nine who had set out on the journey the previous March, Poinsett and two others were the only survivors.

Upon his return to Moscow, Czar Alexander discussed the details of Poinsett&#x27;s trip with him and offered him a position as colonel in the Russian Army. However, news had reached Russia of the attack of the Chesapeake affair, and war between the United States and Great Britain seemed certain. Poinsett eagerly sought to return to his homeland.

Before leaving Russia, Poinsett met one last time with Czar Alexander. The Czar declared that Russia and the United States should maintain friendly relations. Poinsett again met with Foreign Minister Count Romanzoff where the Russian disclosed to Poinsett that the Czar ardently desired to have a minister from the United States at the Russian Court.

==Chile and Argentina==

He served as a &quot;special agent&quot; to two South American countries from 1810 to 1814, Chile and Argentina. President James Madison appointed him in 1809 as Consul in General. Poinsett was to investigate the prospects of the revolutionists, in their struggle for independence from Spain. On December 29, 1811, he reached Santiago. The Larrain and Carrera families were jockeying for power in Chile. By the time Poinsett arrived, the Carreras gained control under their leader, José Miguel Carrera. Carrera&#x27;s government was split on how to receive Poinsett. The Tribunal del Consulado, the organization with jurisdiction over commercial matters opposed his reception on the grounds that his nomination had not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Moreover, many of the members of this group were royalists, hoping for closer relations with Spain or Britain. Nevertheless, Poinsett received recognition as a majority wanted to establish trade relations with the U.S.

The official reception finally occurred on February 24, 1812. Poinsett was the first accredited agent of a foreign government to reach Chile. Poinsett&#x27;s main adversary in Chile was the junta of Peru. The Colonial Viceroy of Peru resented the Chileans&#x27; disregard for Spanish authority. He declared the laws of the new Chilean government relative to free commerce null and void and sent privateers to enforce the old colonial system. Seizure of ships and confiscation of cargoes followed, to the dismay of foreign traders, especially Americans. Poinsett learned of the seizure of an American whaler searching for supplies from an intercepted letter from the governor of San Carlos de Chiloe to the viceroy of Lima. Furthermore, he received intelligence that ten other American vessels were seized at Talcahuano in the Bay of Concepción. With little guidance from the Madison administration, Poinsett decided that something had to be done to halt violations of American neutral rights.

Poinsett urged Chile to close its ports to Peru, but the authorities in Santiago did not feel they were strong enough to take such a step. Instead they urged Poinsett to aid them in obtaining arms and supplies from the United States. Although Poinsett furnished the names of certain dealers, many of them were already too involved with the conflict between the U.S. and Britain to give any attention to the Chileans. During this time Poinsett also urged the Chileans to create a national constitution. A commission consisting of Camilo Henríquez and six others was named for the purpose of drawing up a constitution. The first meeting of the group was held at Poinsett&#x27;s residence on July 11, 1812.

The seizure of American ships by royalist Peru continued. Poinsett&#x27;s commission stated that he was to protect all American property and provide for American citizens. After a consultation with Carrera, Poinsett accepted a commission into the Chilean army to fight against the Spanish Royalists based in Peru. Poinsett was later given the rank of general in Carrera&#x27;s army. He led a charge at the head of the Chilean cavalry in the Battle of San Carlos and secured a victory for Chile. From there, he went with a battery of flying artillery to the Bay of Concepción, where ten American vessels had been seized. He arrived at dark near the seaport of Talcahuano, and began firing on the town. At dawn he sent an emissary to demand the surrender of the bay to the Junta of Chile. The Peruvian royalists surrendered on May 29, 1813.

In early September 1813, the United States Frigate &quot;Essex&quot; arrived in Chilean waters, forcibly seizing the British whalers in the area. When Commodore David Porter of the U.S.S. &quot;Essex&quot; arrived in Santiago, Poinsett received the first authoritative news of the War of 1812. He now desired more than ever to return to his home. However, this could not happen until Commodore Porter completed his cruise of the Pacific. Finally, as the &quot;Essex&quot; set out with Poinsett aboard, the British frigates HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; and HMS &quot;Cherub&quot; were spotted in the port of Valparaiso. Commodore Porter returned to Santiago to utilize the guns of the fort there. After waiting six weeks, Porter decided to launch a desperate breakout but was easily defeated by Captain James Hillyar of the &quot;Phoebe&quot;. The British decided to send their American prisoners of war back to the United States in a cartel. Poinsett was forced to stay behind in Chile.

When Poinsett returned to Buenos Aires, he found a Junta that was very well established. He managed to negotiate a commercial agreement with the Junta by which American articles of general consumption were admitted free of duty. As American shipping had been driven from the South Atlantic, it took some time to find passage back to the United States. Poinsett finally secured passage aboard a vessel going to Bahia, a state in the northeastern part of Brazil. From there he transferred to another ship bound for the Madeira Islands, located 535 miles from mainland Europe. Poinsett finally reached Charleston on May 28, 1815.

==Return to the U.S.==
Returning to Charleston in 1815, Poinsett spent the first few months putting his personal affairs in order. From then until 1825 Poinsett stayed in South Carolina seeking to build a reputation in his home state, and hold office. Yet, he came to be respected as an authority on Latin American affairs. In 1816 Poinsett received a letter from his old friend General Jose Miguel Carrera.

Since Poinsett&#x27;s departure, the Chilean Royalists had consolidated their hold on Chile, and after spending a year in exile in the provinces of the Río de la Plata, Carrera came to the United States in January 1816 to stimulate interest for a revolution in Chile. Poinsett wrote Carrera back stating that he intended to urge the U.S. government to develop decisive policy regarding the Spanish colonies. President James Madison received General Carrera warmly, but never offered him any official encouragement because he worried that seriously entertaining Carrera might jeopardize gaining Florida that was under Spanish rule. Carrera&#x27;s only hope of help came from his former comrade.

In July 1816, Poinsett traveled to New York to meet Carrera. While there, Poinsett attempted to interest John Jacob Astor, the wealthy owner of the American Fur Company, in supplying Carrera&#x27;s Chilean revolutionists with weapons; however, Astor declined to get involved. In August 1816, Poinsett was able to arrange some conferences in Philadelphia between the Chilean leader and some of Napoleon&#x27;s former officers. Among them were Marshal de Grouchy who had commanded Napoleon&#x27;s body guards during the Russian Campaign. Poinsett also arranged a meeting between Carrera and General Bertrand Count Clausel. Clausel had distinguished himself in the Napoleonic Wars and was given the distinction of Peer of France by Napoleon in 1815. Although Carrera&#x27;s movement never benefited from the experience of these French officers, Poinsett did succeed in obtaining contracts with the firm D&#x27;Arcy and Didier of Philadelphia to supply arms for the expedition which Carrera was planning.

On August 29, 1816, Poinsett, along with four free men and one enslaved man from Charleston, set out from Philadelphia on a tour of the western United States. They made stops in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, before stopping in Lexington, Kentucky. While in Lexington, the group stayed with Congressman Henry Clay. It is possible that in relating his experiences in Chile, Poinsett may have made quite an impression on Clay, who would distinguish himself as the biggest American supporter for Spanish American independence in the next few years. From Lexington, the travelers made their way to Louisville, and then on to Nashville, Tennessee. While in Nashville, Poinsett and his companions had breakfast with Andrew Jackson. Poinsett, after traversing more than two thousand miles, finally returned to Charleston in early November 1816.

==Political career==

Poinsett was aware that his friends had nominated him to represent Charleston, South Carolina, in the state legislature. In Greenville on his way back home, he learned that he had won the nomination and had a seat in the State House of Representatives. As he was beginning his first term in April 1817, the rumored position of American envoy to South America became reality. On April 25, 1817, acting Secretary of State Robert Rush offered Poinsett the position of special commissioner to South America stating, &quot;No one has better qualifications for this trust than yourself.&quot; Rush also added that he would be personally gratified by Poinsett&#x27;s acceptance.

Nevertheless, Poinsett declined the honor. In May, Poinsett explained to President James Monroe that he had recently accepted a seat in the legislature of South Carolina and could not resign it &quot;without some more important motive than this commission presents.&quot; Poinsett perceived that the mission would not lead to any substantial decision for recognition and was unwilling to give up his seat in the House. In the same letter, Poinsett offered his knowledge of South America to the service of whomever the Monroe administration appointed.

Poinsett&#x27;s political values mirrored those of others at the time who considered themselves Jeffersonian Republicans. One of the most important measures supported by Jeffersonian Republicans following the War of 1812 was that of federally funded internal improvements. As a member of the state legislature, this was one of Poinsett&#x27;s passions. After being re-elected to the South Carolina House in 1818, he became a member of the Committee on Internal Improvements and Waterways.

Poinsett also served on the South Carolina Board of Public Works as president. One of the main plans of this board was to link the interior of the state with the seaboard. Another important project was the construction of a highway from Charleston through Columbia, to the northwestern border of South Carolina. It was designed to promote interstate commerce as well as to draw commerce from eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina to Charleston. Poinsett, a seasoned traveler, knew better than anyone the importance of good roadways. Through his journeys in New England in 1804 and especially to the west in 1816, Poinsett understood that his country could benefit from transportation facilities.

===Election to Congress===
In 1820, Poinsett won a seat in the United States House of Representatives for the Charleston district. As a congressman, Poinsett continued to call for internal improvements, but he also advocated the maintenance of a strong army and navy. In December 1823, Poinsett submitted a resolution calling upon the Committee on Naval Affairs to inquire into the expediency of authorizing the construction of ten additional sloops of war. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Poinsett took strong views on developments in South America. Poinsett&#x27;s political views were aligned with such nationalists as Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun. Poinsett, like many opponents of Clay&#x27;s American system, opposed the Tariff of 1824.

===First Minister to Mexico===
Poinsett simultaneously served as a special envoy to Mexico from 1822 to 1823, when the government of James Monroe became concerned about the stability of newly independent Mexico. Poinsett, a supporter of the Monroe Doctrine, was convinced that republicanism was the only guarantee of a peaceful, free form of government for North American countries, and tried to influence the government of Agustín de Iturbide, which was beginning to show signs of weakness and divisiveness. The U.S. recognized Mexican independence but it was not until 1825 and the establishment of the Mexican Republic that it sent a minister plenipotentiary. Andrew Jackson and several others turned down the appointment, but Poinsett accepted and resigned his congressional seat.

On January 12, 1828, in Mexico City, Poinsett signed the first treaty between the United States and Mexico, the Treaty of Limits, a treaty that recognized the U.S.-Mexico border established by the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty between Spain and the U.S. Because some U.S. political leaders were dissatisfied with the Treaty of Limits and the Adams–Onís Treaty, Poinsett was sent to negotiate acquisition of new territories for the United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Upper California, as well as parts of Lower California, Sonora, Coahuila, and Nuevo León; but Poinsett&#x27;s offer to purchase these areas was rejected by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs headed by Juan Francisco de Azcárate. (Poinsett wrote &quot;Notes on Mexico&quot;, a memoir of his time in the First Mexican Empire and at the court of Agustín de Iturbide.)

 He became embroiled in the country&#x27;s political turmoil until his recall in 1830, but he did try to further U.S. interests in Mexico by seeking preferential treatment of U.S. goods over those of Britain, attempting to shift the U.S.–Mexico boundary, and urging the adoption of a constitution patterned on that of the U.S.

After visiting an area south of Mexico City near Taxco de Alarcón, Poinsett saw what later became known in the United States as the poinsettia. (In Mexico it is called &quot;Flor de Nochebuena&quot;, Christmas Eve flower, or &quot;Catarina&quot;). Poinsett, an avid amateur botanist, sent samples of the plant to the United States, and by 1836 the plant was widely known as the &quot;poinsettia&quot;. Also a species of Mexican lizard, &quot;Sceloporus poinsettii&quot;, is named in Poinsett&#x27;s honor.

===Unionist===
Although Poinsett was a proponent of the slave system and owned slaves, he returned to South Carolina in 1830 to support the Unionist position during the Nullification Crisis, again serving in the South Carolina state legislature (1830–1831). Poinsett also became a confidential agent of President Andrew Jackson, keeping Jackson abreast of situation in South Carolina between October 1832 and March 1833. In 1833, Poinsett married the widow Mary Izard Pringle (1780–1857), daughter of Ralph and Elizabeth (Stead) Izard.

===Secretary of War===

Poinsett served as Secretary of War from March 7, 1837, to March 5, 1841, overseeing the Trail of Tears, and presided over the continuing suppression of Native American raids by removal of Indians west of the Mississippi and over the Seminole War; reduced the fragmentation of the army by concentrating elements at central locations; equipped the light batteries of artillery regiments as authorized by the 1821 army organization act; and again retired to his plantation at Georgetown, South Carolina, in 1841.

==Personal life==

===Promotion of American Arts===
During the 1820s, Poinsett was a member of the prestigious society, the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1825 and as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1827.

In 1840 he was a cofounder of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science and the Useful Arts, a group of politicians advocating for the use of the &quot;Smithson bequest&quot; for a national museum that would showcase relics of the country and its leaders, celebrate American technology, and document the national resources of North America. The group was defeated in its efforts, as other groups wanted scientists, rather than political leaders, guiding the fortunes of what would become the Smithsonian Institution.

===Freemasonry===
It is unknown when Poinsett became a Master Mason, but it is known that he was a Past Master of Recovery Lodge #31, Greenville, and Solomon&#x27;s Lodge, Charleston. Poinsett played a prominent role in defining Freemasonry in Mexico; he favoured promoting the York Rite, which was allied to the political interests of the United States. This became one of three strands, the other to being allied to Continental Freemasonry and the other an &quot;independent&quot; National Mexican Rite.
==Later life==
He died of tuberculosis, hastened by an attack of pneumonia, in Stateburg, South Carolina, in 1851, and is buried at the Church of the Holy Cross Episcopal Cemetery.

<text>Adrian John Flook (born 9 July 1963) is a British Conservative politician, and a former Member of Parliament (MP).

==Early life==
Flook was educated at King Edward School, Bath and Mansfield College, Oxford where he studied (BA) Modern History. He was a stockbroker from 1985 to 1998, working first for UBS Warburg and then for Société Générale. From 1998 to 2002 he worked as a consultant for Financial Dynamics.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1997 general election, he stood unsuccessfully in the safe Labour Party constituency of Pontefract and Castleford.

At the 2001 general election, he was elected as MP for Taunton, taking the traditionally Conservative seat that had been captured by the Liberal Democrat Jackie Ballard at the 1997 election. Flook&#x27;s victory in Taunton was one of just nine total gains made by the Conservative Party at the 2001 General Election where, under William Hague&#x27;s leadership, the Party made a net gain of just one seat in the House of Commons. The seat of Taunton was high on the Conservative Party&#x27;s target list, receiving a visit from Hague himself on the first day of the campaign. Flook served only one term, losing his seat at the 2005 election to the Liberal Democrat Jeremy Browne. While in Parliament he served on the Select committee on Culture, Media and Sport.

==After Parliament==
Flook worked for the public relations firm M: Communications, where he has performed pro bono work on behalf of the so-called NatWest Three. Currently, he works as a Consultant for C|T|F Partners. He is a national patron of domestic violence charity ManKind Initiative.
He was then elected to Wandsworth Council for the ward of Wandsworth Common in the 2018 local election. Flook subsequently stood and lost in Wandle ward in the 2022 elections.

==Personal life==
He married Frangelica O&#x27;Shea in 2003. Their daughter, Clementine Alexia, was born in 2005.

<text>150 (one hundred [and] fifty) is the natural number following 149 and preceding 151.

== In mathematics ==
*150 is the sum of eight consecutive primes (7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31). Given 150, the Mertens function returns 0.
*150 is conjectured to be the only minimal difference greater than 1 of any increasing arithmetic progression of n primes (in this case, n = 7) that is not a primorial (a product of the first m primes).
*The sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;x&quot;) over the first twenty-two integers is 150.
*150 is a Harshad number and an abundant number.
*150 degrees is the measure of the internal angle of a regular dodecagon.

==In other fields==
150 is also:
* The number of degrees in the quincunx astrological aspect explored by Johannes Kepler.
* The approximate value for Dunbar&#x27;s number, a theoretical value with implications in sociology and anthropology. It is actually 148.

<text>Daphne Barbara Follett (&#x27;Hubbard; born 25 December 1942) is a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stevenage from 1997 to 2010. During this time she held several parliamentary and ministerial positions.

In the decade before entering Parliament she played a major part in transformation of the Labour Party, firstly by making members more aware of their visual impact on voters and secondly by co-founding and running two organisations, Labour Women&#x27;s Network and Emily&#x27;s List UK, which spearheaded reforms that helped Labour to return a record 101 women to Parliament in 1997.

Following the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, she repaid more than £42,000 which she had claimed in expenses - which enabled her to top the list of repayments made by MPs. She stood down in 2010 in order to take over running the business of her husband, author Ken Follett.

==Background==
Follett was born Daphne Barbara Hubbard in Kingston, Jamaica, where her father (originally from Manchester, UK) was an insurance executive. In 1946 the family returned to Britain, first to Jersey then in 1947 to Billericay, Essex. In 1952 the family moved to Ethiopia where her father set up the country&#x27;s first insurance company in partnership with Emperor Haile Selassie. In 1957 after an unfortunate incident involving her alcoholic father, a toast and a drinks trolley, the family were asked to leave the country and went to Cape Town in South Africa. She began a University degree in Art, but in 1962 had to give it up and started work with Barclays Bank.

She married Richard Turner in 1963 and they moved to Paris where Turner studied for his doctorate and she taught at the Berlitz School of Languages (1963–64). In 1964 her first daughter, Jann, was born. They returned to South Africa in 1966 to run his mother&#x27;s fruit farm in Stellenbosch, where they had their second daughter, Kim. In 1969, after experiencing first-hand the hardships of life for farm workers in rural South Africa, she started working for Kupugani (Zulu for &quot;uplift yourself&quot;), an organisation which bought and processed agricultural surplus and then sold it cheaply to poor families. It also provided basic health and education.

In 1970, on the breakdown of her marriage Follett moved back to Cape Town and became acting Regional Secretary at the Institute of Race Relations. She worked again for Kupugani from 1971 to 1978, first as Regional Manager for the Cape and South-West Africa (now Namibia) – then as National Health Education Director (1975–78).

After a brief marriage to Gerald Stonestreet, she married architect Les Broer in 1974. Their son Adam was born in 1975. In January 1978 her ex-husband Richard Turner, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, was assassinated.

Three months later, Follett, who was then running the Women&#x27;s Movement for Peace was told that she too was about to be &quot;banned&quot;. She and her children fled to England and lived in Farnham, Surrey. Follett found work as Assistant Course Organiser and lecturer on Africa for the Farnham-based Centre for International Briefing (1980–84) and joined the local Labour Party.

==Political career==
Follett stood as Labour candidate for Woking in the 1983 general election, but was not elected. In 1985 she married author Ken Follett. From 1984 to 1992 she was a freelance lecturer and consultant, contesting Epsom and Ewell for Labour in 1987, again unsuccessfully. Unhappy with the inequalities that women faced in public life, she joined the Fawcett Society and the National Alliance of Women&#x27;s Organisations and jointly founded the Labour Women&#x27;s Network in 1987, on whose Steering Committee she has served ever since.

Inspired by women in the US, Follett imported the idea of EMILYs List, a fundraiser for women Democrat candidates, into Britain for the Labour Party. She became the Director of EMILY&#x27;s List UK in 1993. The organisation has since backed more than 80 women seeking selection.

During this period she obtained a BSc (Econ) in Economic History from the London School of Economics. She was selected as the candidate in Stevenage (1995) before her postgraduate course could get under way. She concentrated instead on work as visiting fellow at the Institute of Public Policy Research (1993–97).

Follett is also an alumna of the Open University and she has since become a patron of Action on Pre-Eclampsia.

===In Parliament===

The 1997 General Election saw Follett elected as MP for Stevenage. In Parliament she went on the Select Committee on International Development, as well as becoming Chair of the All Party Retail Industry Group; Chair of the Eastern Group of Labour MPS; Chair of the Eastern Region of Labour Movement in Europe; Vice-Chair of the Parliamentary Film Industries Group; a member of Labour&#x27;s backbench Treasury Committee; Joint Secretary of the Population, Development and Reproductive Health Group; and Treasurer of the Sex Equality Group. She is also a member of the Fabian Society.

In May 1999, Follett became a member of the Britain in Europe Council, and served on the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons. In June 2005, she was elected as Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) Women&#x27;s Committee. In November 2005, she became Parliamentary private secretary to Tessa Jowell.

In June 2007 she was appointed to become Minister for the East of England, and, in October 2007, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Equality, supporting the Minister for Women and Equalities, Harriet Harman, with a particular role in drafting the government&#x27;s equality legislation. She then went on to serve as Minister for Culture, Tourism and the Creative Industries between October 2008 and September 2009, before finally serving as Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government until May 2010.

Following the controversy generated by the public disclosure of her expenses Follett announced her decision to stand down at the 2010 general election on 1 October 2009. She cited a desire to spend more time with her family as her motivation for standing down.

Follett is a Director of the Jumby Bay Island Company, based in Antigua, and a member of the Labour Women&#x27;s Network Management Committee.

In 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Follett had begun donating larger amounts to the Labour Party, having previously been a major donor during the periods the party was led by Tony Blair and Ed Miliband.

She is also a Patron of Stevenage Haven; Dignity in Dying; Action on Pre-Eclampsia; Herts Aid; Crucial Crew; The Friends of the Forster Country

==&quot;Brass Eye&quot;==
In 2001, Follett appeared in the television satire programme &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, in a special which satirised media hysteria towards the issue of paedophilia. In the programme, she was duped into giving fake warnings about an online game called &quot;Pantu the dog&quot;, claiming on camera that a paedophile had converted the dog&#x27;s eye into a webcam in order to see the child player. Follett went on to demonstrate how the paedophile would wear a t-shirt with a small illustration of a child&#x27;s body on it in order to disguise themselves as another child, as well as how the paedophiles get children to press their faces against the screen, using special gloves to touch them. Follett complained to the Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) and ITC about being duped into appearing into the programme. The BSC noted that the programme makers had deliberately given warning signals to suggest the material might be dubious and thus rejected Follett&#x27;s complaints against the show as it successfully revealed the dangers of how public figures were willing to speak &quot;with apparent authority about matters they do not understand&quot;.

==Expenses controversies==

In May 2008 following the release of details of MPs expenses it emerged that the taxpayer had paid in excess of £1,600 for window cleaning of Follett&#x27;s London flat in a single year. The invoices for the work were addressed to her husband.

In May of the following year, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that she claimed more than £25,000 for private security patrols at her London home after she was mugged. Follett was also criticised for claiming £120,000 in expenses from the taxpayer over 6 years to pay for a London flat when she already owned one property in the capital. Additionally, commuting to London from her main home in Stevenage takes less than 30 minutes by rail. It was also revealed that Follett had claimed £528.75 to repair and clean a Chinese rug, though only £300 of the claim was actually accepted as the amount was deemed excessive.

In February 2010, following a review of all MP&#x27;s expenses it was revealed that Follett had claimed more in dubious expenses than any other MP. Additional items she was ordered to repay included £4,454 for having six phone lines at her property and £2,812 for insuring her fine art collection. Follet also claimed twice for boiler insurance and for pest control at a property which was not her second home.

Follett had initially insisted all her claims were justified, but following significant criticism she changed her position and agreed to repay £32,976 for the security patrols and other claims. She later repaid £9,482, for a total of £42,458. Follett apologised, stating &quot;I did try to act as honestly as possible but where I failed, I am sorry&quot;.

==Personal life==
She is married to Ken Follett and since leaving Parliament she has become CEO of his company, which has offices in Stevenage. They own two properties in London, one in Knebworth, a property in Cape Town and a holiday home in Jumby Bay, Antigua. She has two daughters, Jann and Kim, a son, Adam, and two stepchildren, Emanuele and Marie-Claire.

Follett and her husband have been referred to as champagne socialists in the right wing media due to the alleged contrast between their political views and their extravagant lifestyle. She is also well known for training Labour Party members on how to handle the media and present themselves, which has been termed &quot;Folletting&quot;. Follett is a frequent donor to the Labour Party.

In an interview, Ken Follett said that his character Pauline Green, president of the United States in his 2021 novel, &quot;Never&quot;, is based in part on Barbara Follett.

<text>Michael John Foster (born 14 March 1963) is a former Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Worcester from 1997 until 2010, and was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development.

==Early life==
Michael Foster was born in Birmingham and was educated at the Great Wyrley High School in Great Wyrley near Cannock, and Wolverhampton Polytechnic (now Wolverhampton University) where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1984. He later studied at the University of Wolverhampton where he received a Postgraduate Certificate in Education in 1995.

He joined Jaguar Cars in 1984 as a financial analyst, becoming a senior analyst in 1985 and a management accountant in 1987. He left Jaguar in 1991 to become a lecturer in accountancy and finance at Worcester College of Technology, where he remained until he became an MP.

==Parliamentary career==
He joined the Labour Party in 1980, and was a shop steward for the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union for two years from 1986. He became the secretary of the Worcestershire Mid Constituency Labour Party in 1987, and the secretary of the Worcester Constituency Labour Party for three years from 1992. Michael Foster was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for Worcester with a majority of 7,425, and remained the MP there until 2010. He made his maiden speech on 2 June 1997, where he spoke of the constituency and the Royal Worcester porcelain. He was the first Labour MP to represent Worcester in Parliament.

He joined the education and employment select committee in 1999, and after the 2001 General Election he served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Department for Education and Skills Margaret Hodge. After the 2005 General Election he became the PPS to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain. In the reshuffle of May 2006, he entered the government as an assistant whip. In another reshuffle in October 2008, he was promoted to be a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development.

Foster introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to ban hunting with dogs in 1997; although his bill did not become law, its principles were later passed into law by the Hunting Act 2004.

Foster lost his seat to Robin Walker Conservative in the May 2010 election.

<doc id="421635" wikidata="Q6831542" url="?curid=421635" title="Michael Foster (Hastings and Rye MP)">
<text>Michael Jabez Foster (born 26 February 1946) is a British lawyer and Labour politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hastings and Rye from 1997 to 2010, and served in government as a Minister for Equalities from 2009 to 2010.

==Early life==
Michael Foster was born in Hastings, Sussex and attended the local Hastings Secondary School for Boys and the Hastings Grammar School before attending the University of Leicester where he received a Master of Laws (LLM) degree. Between 1963 and 1972 he worked as a litigation clerk; he was admitted as a solicitor in 1980 and later worked as a partner of Fynmores Solicitors in Bexhill-on-Sea specialising in employment law until 1998.

He was elected as a councillor to the Hastings Borough Council in 1970, becoming the Labour group leader for a year in 1973, serving on the council until 1977, he was again elected to the Borough Council 1981–1985. He received a dual mandate in 1974 when he was also elected as a councillor to the East Sussex County Council, becoming the deputy Labour group leader 1984–1992, he stood down from the county council in 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
He unsuccessfully contested Hastings at both the February and October 1974 general elections and again at the 1979 General Election, and on each occasion was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Kenneth Warren. He won Hastings and Rye at the 1997 General Election when he became the second least expected Labour MP in the landslide. He defeated the new sitting Conservative MP Jacqui Lait by 2,560 votes and remained the MP until 2010. He made his maiden speech on 21 November 1997.

In parliament he was a member of the social security select committee in 1998 until he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney General Gareth Williams in 1999 and his successor Peter Goldsmith until the 2005 General Election. From 2005 he served as a member of the work and pensions and standards and privileges select committees.

In 2003, Foster has called for then-Home Secretary David Blunkett to deport a convicted murderer who was freed after serving 12 months of his 36-year sentence.

Foster later resigned as a PPS in 2003 over the Iraq War, which he regarded as being illegal without a mandate from the United Nations. He subsequently returned to Government.

In 2009, Foster was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Equality in the Government Equalities Office, responsible for the progress of the Government&#x27;s Equalities Bill through the House of Commons.

Foster lost his seat at the 2010 as part of the national swing to the Conservatives.

Other interests include pensioners rights, child poverty and animal welfare.

He currently runs his own law practice, specialising in employment law.
