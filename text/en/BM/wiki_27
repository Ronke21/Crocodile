<text>Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Howard Hanson first elaborated many of the concepts for analyzing tonal music. Other theorists, such as Allen Forte, further developed the theory for analyzing atonal music, drawing on the twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of musical set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equal temperament tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as transposition, melodic inversion, and complementation. Some theorists apply the methods of musical set theory to the analysis of rhythm as well.

==Comparison with mathematical set theory==

Although musical set theory is often thought to involve the application of mathematical set theory to music, there are numerous differences between the methods and terminology of the two. For example, musicians use the terms transposition and inversion where mathematicians would use translation and reflection. Furthermore, where musical set theory refers to ordered sets, mathematics would normally refer to tuples or sequences (though mathematics does speak of ordered sets, and although these can be seen to include the musical kind in some sense, they are far more involved).

Moreover, musical set theory is more closely related to group theory and combinatorics than to mathematical set theory, which concerns itself with such matters as, for example, various sizes of infinitely large sets. In combinatorics, an unordered subset of objects, such as pitch classes, is called a combination, and an ordered subset a &quot;permutation&quot;. Musical set theory is better regarded as an application of combinatorics to music theory than as a branch of mathematical set theory. Its main connection to mathematical set theory is the use of the vocabulary of set theory to talk about finite sets.

==Types of sets==
The fundamental concept of musical set theory is the (musical) set, which is an unordered collection of pitch classes. More exactly, a pitch-class set is a numerical representation consisting of distinct integers (i.e., without duplicates). The elements of a set may be manifested in music as simultaneous chords, successive tones (as in a melody), or both. Notational conventions vary from author to author, but sets are typically enclosed in curly braces: {}, or square brackets: [].

Some theorists use angle brackets to denote ordered sequences, while others distinguish ordered sets by separating the numbers with spaces. Thus one might notate the unordered set of pitch classes 0, 1, and 2 (corresponding in this case to C, C, and D) as {0,1,2}. The ordered sequence C-C-D would be notated or (0,1,2). Although C is considered zero in this example, this is not always the case. For example, a piece (whether tonal or atonal) with a clear pitch center of F might be most usefully analyzed with F set to zero (in which case {0,1,2} would represent F, F and G. (For the use of numbers to represent notes, see pitch class.)

Though set theorists usually consider sets of equal-tempered pitch classes, it is possible to consider sets of pitches, non-equal-tempered pitch classes, rhythmic onsets, or &quot;beat classes&quot;.

Two-element sets are called dyads, three-element sets trichords (occasionally &quot;triads&quot;, though this is easily confused with the traditional meaning of the word triad). Sets of higher cardinalities are called tetrachords (or tetrads), pentachords (or pentads), hexachords (or hexads), heptachords (heptads or, sometimes, mixing Latin and Greek roots, &quot;septachords&quot;—e.g. Rahn), octachords (octads), nonachords (nonads), decachords (decads), undecachords, and, finally, the dodecachord.

==Basic operations==

The basic operations that may be performed on a set are transposition and inversion. Sets related by transposition or inversion are said to be &quot;transpositionally related&quot; or &quot;inversionally related,&quot; and to belong to the same set class. Since transposition and inversion are isometries of pitch-class space, they preserve the intervallic structure of a set, even if they do not preserve the musical character (i.e. the physical reality) of the elements of the set. This can be considered the central postulate of musical set theory. In practice, set-theoretic musical analysis often consists in the identification of non-obvious transpositional or inversional relationships between sets found in a piece.

Some authors consider the operations of complementation and multiplication as well. The complement of set X is the set consisting of all the pitch classes not contained in X. The product of two pitch classes is the product of their pitch-class numbers modulo 12. Since complementation and multiplication are not isometries of pitch-class space, they do not necessarily preserve the musical character of the objects they transform. Other writers, such as Allen Forte, have emphasized the Z-relation, which obtains between two sets that share the same total interval content, or interval vector—but are not transpositionally or inversionally equivalent. Another name for this relationship, used by Hanson, is &quot;isomeric&quot;.

Operations on ordered sequences of pitch classes also include transposition and inversion, as well as retrograde and rotation. Retrograding an ordered sequence reverses the order of its elements. Rotation of an ordered sequence is equivalent to cyclic permutation.

Transposition and inversion can be represented as elementary arithmetic operations. If is a number representing a pitch class, its transposition by semitones is written T =  +  mod 12. Inversion corresponds to reflection around some fixed point in pitch class space. If is a pitch class, the inversion with index number is written I =  -  mod 12.

==Equivalence relation==
&quot;For a relation in set &quot;S&quot; to be an equivalence relation [in algebra], it has to satisfy three conditions: it has to be reflexive ..., symmetrical ..., and transitive ...&quot;. &quot;Indeed, an informal notion of equivalence has always been part of music theory and analysis. PC set theory, however, has adhered to formal definitions of equivalence.&quot;

==Transpositional and inversional set classes==
Two transpositionally related sets are said to belong to the same transpositional set class (T). Two sets related by transposition or inversion are said to belong to the same transpositional/inversional set class (inversion being written TI or I). Sets belonging to the same transpositional set class are very similar-sounding; while sets belonging to the same transpositional/inversional set class could include two chords of the same type but in different keys, which would be less similar in sound but obviously still a bounded category. Because of this, music theorists often consider set classes basic objects of musical interest.

There are two main conventions for naming equal-tempered set classes. One, known as the Forte number, derives from Allen Forte, whose &quot;The Structure of Atonal Music&quot; (1973), is one of the first works in musical set theory. Forte provided each set class with a number of the form –, where indicates the cardinality of the set and is the ordinal number. Thus the chromatic trichord {0, 1, 2} belongs to set-class 3–1, indicating that it is the first three-note set class in Forte&#x27;s list. The augmented trichord {0, 4, 8}, receives the label 3–12, which happens to be the last trichord in Forte&#x27;s list.

The primary criticisms of Forte&#x27;s nomenclature are: (1) Forte&#x27;s labels are arbitrary and difficult to memorize, and it is in practice often easier simply to list an element of the set class; (2) Forte&#x27;s system assumes equal temperament and cannot easily be extended to include diatonic sets, pitch sets (as opposed to pitch-class sets), multisets or sets in other tuning systems; (3) Forte&#x27;s original system considers inversionally related sets to belong to the same set-class. This means that, for example a major triad and a minor triad are considered the same set.

Western tonal music for centuries has regarded major and minor, as well as chord inversions, as significantly different. They generate indeed completely different physical objects. Ignoring the physical reality of sound is an obvious limitation of atonal theory. However, the defense has been made that theory was not created to fill a vacuum in which existing theories inadequately explained tonal music. Rather, Forte&#x27;s theory is used to explain atonal music, where the composer has invented a system where the distinction between {0, 4, 7} (called &#x27;major&#x27; in tonal theory) and its inversion {0, 3, 7} (called &#x27;minor&#x27; in tonal theory) may not be relevant.

The second notational system labels sets in terms of their normal form, which depends on the concept of &quot;normal order&quot;. To put a set in &quot;normal order,&quot; order it as an ascending scale in pitch-class space that spans less than an octave. Then permute it cyclically until its first and last notes are as close together as possible. In the case of ties, minimize the distance between the first and next-to-last note. (In case of ties here, minimize the distance between the first and next-to-next-to-last note, and so on.) Thus {0, 7, 4} in normal order is {0, 4, 7}, while {0, 2, 10} in normal order is {10, 0, 2}. To put a set in normal form, begin by putting it in normal order, and then transpose it so that its first pitch class is 0. Mathematicians and computer scientists most often order combinations using either alphabetical ordering, binary (base two) ordering, or Gray coding, each of which lead to differing but logical normal forms.

Since transpositionally related sets share the same normal form, normal forms can be used to label the T set classes.

To identify a set&#x27;s T/I set class:
* Identify the set&#x27;s T set class.
* Invert the set and find the inversion&#x27;s T set class.
* Compare these two normal forms to see which is most &quot;left packed.&quot;
The resulting set labels the initial set&#x27;s T/I set class.

==Symmetries==
The number of distinct operations in a system that map a set into itself is the set&#x27;s degree of symmetry. The degree of symmetry, &quot;specifies the number of operations that preserve the unordered pcsets of a partition; it tells the extent to which that partition&#x27;s pitch-class sets map into (or onto) each other under transposition or inversion&quot;. Every set has at least one symmetry, as it maps onto itself under the identity operation T. Transpositionally symmetric sets map onto themselves for T where does not equal 0 (mod 12). Inversionally symmetric sets map onto themselves under TI. For any given T/TI type all sets have the same degree of symmetry. The number of distinct sets in a type is 24 (the total number of operations, transposition and inversion, for n = 0 through 11) divided by the degree of symmetry of T/TI type.

Transpositionally symmetrical sets either divide the octave evenly, or can be written as the union of equally sized sets that themselves divide the octave evenly. Inversionally symmetrical chords are invariant under reflections in pitch class space. This means that the chords can be ordered cyclically so that the series of intervals between successive notes is the same read forward or backward. For instance, in the cyclical ordering (0, 1, 2, 7), the interval between the first and second note is 1, the interval between the second and third note is 1, the interval between the third and fourth note is 5, and the interval between the fourth note and the first note is 5.

One obtains the same sequence if one starts with the third element of the series and moves backward: the interval between the third element of the series and the second is 1; the interval between the second element of the series and the first is 1; the interval between the first element of the series and the fourth is 5; and the interval between the last element of the series and the third element is 5. Symmetry is therefore found between T0 and T2I, and there are 12 sets in the T/TI equivalence class.

<text>John Palliser (29 January 1817 – 18 August 1887) was an Irish-born geographer and explorer. Following his service in the Waterford Militia and hunting excursions to the North American prairies, he led the British North American Exploring Expedition which investigated the geography, climate and ecology of what would later become western Canada.

==Biography==
Born in Dublin, Ireland, he was the son of Colonel Wray Palliser and a brother of Major Sir William Palliser (1830–1882), all descendants of Dr William Palliser, Archbishop of Cashel (1644–1726).

From 1839 to 1863, Palliser served in the Waterford Militia, eventually with the rank of captain. He was also appointed High Sheriff of County Waterford for 1844–45. During a hunting expedition in British North America in 1847, Palliser wrote &quot;Solitary Rambles and Adventures of a Hunter in the Prairies&quot;, first published in 1853. He travelled back to British North America as leader of the British North American Exploring Expedition, which travelled over the uncharted regions of the far west between 1857 and 1861. He made a topographical delimitation of the boundary between British North America and the United States, from Lake Superior to the coast of the Pacific Ocean. He was assisted by astronomer Lieutenant Thomas Blakiston of the Royal Artillery, botanist Eugène Bourgeau and geologist Dr James Hector.

While travelling he explored a few rivers:

* White Fish River
* Kaministiquia River
* North Saskatchewan River
* South Saskatchewan River
* Red River

In 1859 Palliser was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his Survey of the Rocky Mountains. He returned to Ireland in 1862 and presented his findings to the British Parliament.

The information contained in his survey was instrumental in ending the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s ownership of Rupert&#x27;s Land (lands encompassing all tributaries to Hudson Bay) with the Deed of Surrender, which came into effect in 1870. While Palliser is credited with opening up a new era of settlement and development in the Canadian West, his warnings about the unsuitability to agricultural development of the area now known as Palliser&#x27;s Triangle went unheeded. Palliser reported that the region including what is now southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, was too arid for farming. The area was nevertheless settled for farming, but was devastated in the Dust Bowl drought.
In 1869 he travelled to Novaya Zemlya in Russia with another brother, Frederick Palliser, aboard the ship &quot;Sampson&quot;.

Palliser was named a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) in the 1877 Birthday Honours. He never married and retired to Ireland, where he spent the rest of his life caring for his family. He died at his house, Comeragh House, Mahon Bridge, in County Waterford, Ireland in 1887. He is buried in the graveyard of Comeragh Church, Briska, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford. The Alberta administration has placed a plaque on his grave in commemoration of his achievements.

The Fairmont Palliser Hotel and the neighbourhood of Palliser in Calgary, Alberta, are named after him, as are the Palliser Range, Palliser Regional School Division and Palliser Formation of the Canadian Rockies. The University of Calgary undergraduate Geography club is named the Palliser Club. The railway station named Palliser located at mile 22.4 on CPKC Mountain subdivision is named after Captain Palliser.

<doc id="414804" wikidata="Q269868" url="?curid=414804" title="Richard Burden">
<text>Richard Haines Burden (born 1 September 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Northfield from 1992 to 2019. He served as a Shadow Transport Minister from 2013 to 2016 and again from 2016 to 2017. After the 2017 general election, he returned to the backbenches and served as a member of the House of Commons International Development Committee.

==Early life==
Burden was born in Liverpool. He attended the Wallasey Technical Grammar School; Bramhall Comprehensive School; St John&#x27;s College of Further Education, Manchester; the University of York, where he obtained a degree in Politics and was the president of the Students&#x27; Union in 1976; and then the University of Warwick where he received a master&#x27;s degree in Industrial Relations.

On leaving university he was appointed the branch organiser in North Yorkshire in the National and Local Government Officers&#x27; Association in 1979, becoming the district officer for the West Midlands in 1981, a position he held until his election to Westminster. He is a member of the Transport and General Workers Union which he joined in 1979.

==Political career==

===Entering Parliament===
He contested the parliamentary seat of Meriden at the 1987 general election, where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Iain Mills by a margin of 16,820. He was then selected to fight the Conservative-held marginal seat of Birmingham Northfield at the 1992 general election. Burden defeated the sitting Tory MP Roger King by just 630 votes and became a Labour MP. He made his maiden speech on 19 May 1992.

After Labour formed the government following the 1997 general election, Burden was appointed the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and fellow Birmingham MP Jeff Rooker, and he remained Rooker&#x27;s PPS when he became the Minister of State at the Department of Social Security.

===On the Backbenches===
Following the 2001 general election Burden became a member of the Trade and Industry Select Committee, and after the 2005 election moved to the International Development Committee.

His Birmingham Northfield constituency was long dominated by the local car manufacturer MG Rover, which went into administration after negotiations with Chinese car manufacturer Shanghai Automotive failed in April 2005. The site has since been sold to Chinese car company Nanjing Automotive.

He was present at the meeting in Birmingham with the Labour government&#x27;s leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown along with Tony Woodley on 8 April 2005 when the future of MG Rover was decided. The Labour government decided not to give further support to MG Rover and consequently the company entered into administrative receivership, with 6,500 employees being made redundant in addition to many other employees of its car dealerships and component suppliers in the United Kingdom. Burden, as the MP for Northfield which included Longbridge, raised the issue in Parliament from time to time, in relation to the local economy, jobs and skills.

Burden voted against his own Labour government on a few occasions, most notably on the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the 2005 anti-terror bill, which included a provision to hold terrorist suspects for 90 days without trial.

He was re-elected at the May 2010 general election. He was not invited to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao&#x27;s visit to Longbridge in June 2011 and complained bitterly to the local press at being excluded; it is not known why he was &#x27;excluded&#x27;, when other leading local politicians were invited, though he suggested it was a decision made by the then-Conservative-run City Council.

Together with his friend and fellow ex-Young Liberal Peter Hain MP, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the unsuccessful Alternative Vote system in the May 2011 referendum.

===Frontbench===
Burden became Shadow Transport Minister under Ed Miliband in 2013, with responsibility for roads and road safety, motor agencies, cycling and future transport.

He retained a Shadow Ministerial role under Jeremy Corbyn after he was elected as party leader in 2015. Burden resigned from this position following a vote of no confidence in Corbyn by members of the Parliamentary party, telling Corbyn he was &quot;making a bad situation worse&quot; by choosing to remain Labour leader. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. He rejoined the frontbench as Shadow Transport Minister in October 2016, with responsibility for aviation, maritime, roads and future transport. He stayed in this post until the 2017 general election, after which he stood down from the frontbench to join the International Development Committee.

In the 2016 United Kingdom referendum on membership of the European Union he supported Remain; however, the majority of his constituents in Birmingham Northfield voted Leave (61.8% Leave, 38.2% Remain, with all 4 wards in the constituency voting Leave).

In the United Kingdom general election held on 12 December 2019, he stood for re-election and was one of the many Labour MPs to be defeated, losing his seat to the Conservative candidate, Gary Sambrook, who won by a majority of 1,640 votes; Burden received 18,317 votes to Sambrook&#x27;s 19,957 votes.

===Interests===

Burden was Chair of the Palestine All Party Parliamentary Group and frequently asked questions of ministers on issues relating to the Middle East conflict. He was one of the most prominent parliamentary critics of Israeli policy in the region, particularly with regard to its expansion of settlements in the West Bank. He was also Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Motor Group.

He speaks French and is an avid motorsport fan. In 2002 he became the special advisor to the Minister of Sport, Richard Caborn, on motorsport.

<text>A darkroom is used to process photographic film, make prints and carry out other associated tasks. It is a room that can be made completely dark to allow the processing of light-sensitive photographic materials, including film and photographic paper. Various equipment is used in the darkroom, including an enlarger, baths containing chemicals, and running water.

Darkrooms have been used since the inception of photography in the early 19th century. Darkrooms have many various manifestations, from the elaborate space used by Ansel Adams to a retooled ambulance wagon used by Timothy H. O&#x27;Sullivan. From the initial development of the film to the creation of prints, the darkroom process allows complete control over the medium.

Due to the popularity of color photography and complexity of processing color film (&quot;see C-41 process&quot;) and printing color photographs and also to the rise, first of instant photography technology and later digital photography, darkrooms are decreasing in popularity, though are still commonplace on college campuses, schools and in the studios of many professional photographers.

Other applications of darkrooms include the use in nondestructive testing, such as magnetic particle inspection.

==Darkroom equipment==


In most darkrooms, an enlarger, an optical apparatus similar to a slide projector, that projects light through the image of a negative onto a base, finely controls the focus, intensity and duration of light, is used for printmaking. A sheet of photographic paper is exposed to the light coming through the negative, resulting in a positive version of the image on the paper.
When making black-and-white prints, a safelight is commonly used to illuminate the work area. Since the majority of black-and-white papers are sensitive to only blue, or to blue and green light, a red- or amber-colored light can be safely used without exposing the paper.

Color print paper, being sensitive to all parts of the visible spectrum, must be kept in complete darkness until the prints are properly fixed. A very dim variation of safelight that can be used with certain negative color materials exists, but the light emitted by one is so low that most printers do not use one at all.

Another use for a darkroom is to load film in and out of cameras, development spools, or film holders, which requires complete darkness. Lacking a darkroom, a photographer can make use of a changing bag, which is a small bag with sleeved arm holes specially designed to be completely light proof and used to prepare film prior to exposure or developing.

===Print processing===

During exposure, values in the image can be adjusted, most often by &quot;dodging&quot; (reducing the amount of light to a specific area of an image by selectively blocking light to it for part or all of the exposure time) and/or &quot;burning&quot; (giving additional exposure to specific area of an image by exposing only it while blocking light to the rest). Filters, usually thin pieces of colored plastic, can be used to increase or decrease an image&#x27;s contrast (the difference between dark tones and light tones). One method of photographic printing, called &quot;split filter printing,&quot; is where the photographer determines two separate exposure times using two separate filters (typically a 0 or 00, and a 5) to create a single print. This method allows the photographer to achieve a broad tonal range, with detailed highlights and rich blacks. After exposure, the photographic printing paper (which still appears blank) is ready to be processed.

Photographers generally begin printing a roll of film by making a contact print of their negatives to use as a quick reference to decide which images to enlarge. Some large format photographers, such as Edward Weston, make only contact prints of their large (4x5&quot;, 5x7&quot;, 8x10&quot; or larger) negatives.

The paper that has been exposed is processed, first by immersion in a photographic developer, halting development with a stop bath, and fixing in a photographic fixer. The print is then washed to remove the processing chemicals and dried. There are a variety of other, additional steps a photographer may take, such as toning.

<text>Colin Burgon (born 22 April 1948) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Elmet from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==

Colin Burgon was born in Leeds to Catholic, Labour-supporting parents. His mother, Winnie, was a school secretary; his father, Tommy, was a tailor; and his brother Terence also became a teacher. He was educated at St Charles R.C. Junior School and passed the eleven-plus exam, enabling him to attend St Michael&#x27;s Catholic College in Woodhouse. In later life, Burgon said that alighting the bus wearing a grammar school uniform in Gipton made him aware of the class system and made him &quot;deplore structures that inherently deny opportunity to people&quot;.

On leaving school, Burgon trained as a teacher at Carnegie College, Leeds, then studied at Huddersfield Polytechnic. Burgon worked as a history teacher at Foxwood High School (which later became East Leeds Family Learning Centre and was demolished in 2009), a deprived secondary school in the Seacroft area of East Leeds, where he was an active member of the NUT union. Burgon left teaching and the NUT in 1987 to work for Wakefield District Council as a local government policy and research officer. He was also a research officer with the GMB Union. Burgon was made an honorary member of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for his support for NUM actions in the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. Before he became an MP, Burgon worked with Elmet miners and their families during and after the strike.

==Parliamentary career==
Burgon was the election agent for the Labour Party in Elmet in 1983 before being selected himself as the Labour candidate for Elmet. Burgon unsuccessfully contested Elmet in 1987 and 1992, both times coming second to the incumbent Conservative, Spencer Batiste.

In 1997, Burgon contested Elmet for the third time, finally defeating Batiste with an 8,779-vote majority. He was re-elected in 2001 and 2005. In the House of Commons, he was elected to sit on the Northern Ireland Select committee in 2000, and the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2005. Burgon has also taken interest in socialism in South America, particularly in Venezuela. In May 2007, he wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in support of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and his government&#x27;s controversial refusal to renew the broadcasting licence of a television station that had been openly supportive of the coup against Chávez&#x27;s elected government. Burgon was the chairman of Labour Friends of Venezuela. He is on the left of the Labour Party and has vociferously criticised what he calls the &quot;neo-liberal&quot; policies the party pursued during the New Labour leaderships of Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Burgon stood down from Parliament in 2010.

==Personal life==
Burgon is divorced and has one daughter. He has taken a keen interest in opencast mining, an important issue in Elmet. His nephew Richard Burgon has been a Labour MP since 2015.

<doc id="414813" wikidata="Q336866" url="?curid=414813" title="John Burnett, Baron Burnett">
<text>John Patrick Aubone Burnett, Baron Burnett (born 19 September 1945) is a British Liberal Democrat politician, a member of the House of Lords, and was a Member of Parliament for Torridge and West Devon between 1997 and 2005 general elections.

==Personal life==
John Burnett is the son of Lieutenant Colonel Aubone Burnett OBE (1909–1958) an army lawyer, and Joan Bolt. He was educated at Ampleforth College before joining the Royal Marines.

He was a commando with the Royal Marines for seven years, a Devon Ruby cattle-breeder, and remains a Consultant/ Legal Adviser at Stephens Scown Solicitors, Exeter, Truro and St. Austell. From 1976 to 1997, he was a partner in Okehampton law firm Burd Pearse.

In 1971, he married Elizabeth Sherwood de la Mare, daughter of the diplomat Sir Arthur de la Mare. They have 4 children and 11 grandchildren.

Lord Burnett was Chairman of Governors at the Plymouth Diocese Catholic Academy Schools Trust until 31 October 2020, is chairman and Trustee of Charitable Giving, and is President of a number of charities including the Royal Marines Association (Tavistock branch), Okehampton Argyle Football Club, Okehampton Small-Bore Association and Dartmoor Search and Rescue Team (Tavistock)

==Political career==
In 1997, he won the seat of Devon West and Torridge as a Liberal Democrat MP. He succeeded Emma Nicholson as MP for the constituency, after her defection in 1995 from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Democrats, and her elevation as a Liberal Democrat peer. Burnett was re-elected in the 2001 general election.

He was the Liberal Democrats frontbench Spokesperson on Home Affairs from May 1997 – July 2004 and on Justice from July 2004 – May 2005.

Following Burnett&#x27;s decision to stand down in 2005, there was a swing of 5,000 votes in the 2005 election against Burnett&#x27;s Liberal Democrat successor as candidate, David Walter. The constituency was reduced in size in a 2006 Boundary Commission re-alignment, and was retained by the Conservative Party.

In April 2006 it was announced that Burnett would be created a life peer to join the Liberal Democrat ranks in the House of Lords, and on 31 May he was created Baron Burnett, of Whitchurch in the County of Devon.

Burnett for much of his 8 years in Parliament had been regarded among his fellow Liberal Democrat MPs as &quot;the cat that walked alone&quot;: he distanced himself over his Party&#x27;s stance on the war in Iraq, for example.

One of the high points of Burnett&#x27;s parliamentary career was his promotion of the Bill which became the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, allowing solicitors, for example, to remain in the traditional partnership arrangements while having some of the benefits of limited companies.

In the House of Lords, he has spoken primarily on armed forces issues.

<doc id="414818" wikidata="Q269909" url="?curid=414818" title="Andy Burnham">
<text>Andrew Murray Burnham (born 7 January 1970) is a British politician who has served as Mayor of Greater Manchester since 2017. He served in Gordon Brown&#x27;s Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2007 to 2008, Culture Secretary from 2008 to 2009 and Health Secretary from 2009 to 2010. A member of Labour Co-op, Burnham identifies as a socialist and as belonging to the party&#x27;s soft left. He once identified as being on the Blairite wing of the party. He served as Shadow Home Secretary from 2015 to 2016 and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Leigh from 2001 to 2017.

Born in the Old Roan area of Aintree, Burnham was educated at St Aelred&#x27;s Catholic High School in Newton-le-Willows and graduated with a degree in English from the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. He worked as a researcher for Tessa Jowell from 1994 to 1997, then worked for the NHS Confederation in 1997 and as an administrator for the Football Task Force in 1998. He was a special adviser to Culture Secretary Chris Smith from 1998 to 2001. Following the retirement of Lawrence Cunliffe, the Labour MP for Leigh, Burnham was elected to succeed him in 2001.

Burnham served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary from 2003 to 2005. He was promoted by Prime Minister Tony Blair to serve in his government after the 2005 election as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. In 2006, Burnham was reshuffled to become Minister of State for Health. When Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in 2007, Burnham was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a position he held until 2008, when he became Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. In 2009, he was promoted again to become Health Secretary. In that role, he responded to the swine flu pandemic, opposed further privatisation of National Health Service services and launched an independent inquiry into the Stafford Hospital scandal. Following the Labour Party&#x27;s defeat in the 2010 general election, Burnham was a candidate in the 2010 Labour leadership election, coming fourth out of five candidates. The contest was won by Ed Miliband. Burnham served as Shadow Secretary of State for Health until late 2010, when he was moved by Miliband to become Shadow Secretary of State for Education. He held that role for a year, then returning to the role of Shadow Health Secretary.

Following Miliband&#x27;s resignation as Labour leader due to the 2015 general election defeat, Burnham launched his campaign to succeed Miliband in the resulting September 2015 leadership election. He finished a distant second behind Jeremy Corbyn, after which he accepted a role in Corbyn&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Home Secretary. After being selected as Labour&#x27;s candidate for the new Greater Manchester Mayoralty, Burnham stood down as Shadow Home Secretary in 2016 and as an MP at the 2017 general election. Burnham won the 2017 mayoral election, was re-elected in the delayed election held in May 2021, and elected for a third time in the 2024 election. For his role campaigning to secure more money for local Northern communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, he was dubbed the &quot;King of the North&quot; by the media.

==Early life and education==
Andrew Murray Burnham was born on 7 January 1970 in Aintree, Lancashire (now part of Liverpool City Region, Merseyside). His father, Kenneth Roy Burnham, was a telephone engineer and his mother, Eileen Mary Burnham, was a receptionist. He was brought up in Culcheth and educated at St Lewis Catholic Primary School and St Aelred&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School, in Newton le Willows, St Helens. He studied English at the University of Cambridge as an undergraduate student of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.

==Career==
Burnham joined the Labour Party when he was 15. From 1994 until the 1997 general election he was a researcher for Tessa Jowell. He joined the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union in 1995. Following the 1997 election, he was a parliamentary officer for the NHS Confederation from August to December 1997, before taking up the post as an administrator with the Football Task Force for a year.

In 1998, he became a special adviser to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Chris Smith, a position he remained in until he was elected to the House of Commons in 2001.

===Member of Parliament===
Following the retirement of Lawrence Cunliffe, Burnham successfully applied to be the parliamentary candidate for Leigh in Greater Manchester, then a safe Labour seat. At the 2001 election he was elected with a majority of 16,362, and gave his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 4 July 2001.

Following his election to Parliament, Burnham was a member of the Health Select Committee from 2001 until 2003, when he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Home Secretary David Blunkett. Following Blunkett&#x27;s first resignation in 2004, he became PPS to the education secretary Ruth Kelly. Burnham voted for the Iraq War, and consistently voted against holding an inquiry into the war.

===In Government (2005–2010)===

Following the 2005 election Burnham was promoted to serve in the Government as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, with responsibility for implementing the Identity Cards Act 2006. In the government reshuffle of 5 May 2006, he was moved from the Home Office and promoted to Minister of State for Delivery and Reform at the Department of Health. In Gordon Brown&#x27;s first cabinet, announced on 28 June 2007, Burnham was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a position he held until 2008. During his time at the Treasury, he helped write the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review.

====Brown Cabinet (2008–2010)====
In a re-shuffle in January 2008, Burnham was promoted to the position of Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, replacing James Purnell. In June 2008, he apologised to the director of pressure group Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, after she threatened to sue him for libel for smearing her reputation in an article Burnham had written for Progress magazine.

In late 2008, Burnham announced government plans to tighten controls on internet content in order to &quot;even up&quot; what he described as an imbalance with TV regulations. The announcement was followed by a speech to the music industry&#x27;s lobbying group, UK Music, in which he announced &quot;a time that calls for partnership between Government and the music business as a whole: one with rewards for both of us; one with rewards for society as a whole. (...) My job – Government&#x27;s job – is to preserve the value in the system.&quot;

In April 2009, after being heckled at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, Burnham used the next day&#x27;s cabinet meeting in Downing Street to ask then prime minister Gordon Brown if he could raise the issue of Hillsborough in Parliament, and Brown agreed. The eventual result was the second Hillsborough inquiry. In 2014, when Burnham spoke at the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he was cheered and applauded by the crowd.
In June 2009, Burnham was again promoted, becoming Secretary of State for Health. He held the post until the Labour government resigned after the 2010 general election. In July 2009, a month after he became health secretary, Burnham launched an independent inquiry chaired by the QC Robert Francis into unusually high mortality rates at Stafford Hospital. The inquiry found systematic failures at the hospital, and was critical of care provided by the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. A wider public inquiry, also led by Robert Francis, was launched in 2010 by his successor as health secretary, Andrew Lansley. It found serious failings at the hospital but concluded it would be &quot;misleading&quot; to link those failings to a particular number of deaths. After leaving office, reports claimed that Burnham and his predecessor as health secretary, Alan Johnson, had rejected 81 requests for an inquiry sitting in public to examine the high rate of deaths at Stafford hospital. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, after initial concerns were raised about links between mortality rates and standards of care in 2005, there were up to 2,800 more deaths than expected across 14 NHS trusts highlighted as having unusually high death rates. However, these figures for deaths were discredited. A report, the Keogh Review, following an investigation into the 14 NHS trusts by Bruce Keogh, described the use of such statistical measures as &quot;clinically meaningless and academically reckless&quot;.

===In Opposition (2010–2017)===
====First leadership campaign (2010)====
After May 2010, following the defeat of Gordon Brown&#x27;s government, Burnham became Shadow Secretary of State for Health. Following Brown&#x27;s resignation as leader of the Labour Party, Burnham declared his intention to stand in the subsequent leadership contest. He launched his leadership campaign in his Leigh constituency on 26 May. Burnham stood on his philosophy of &quot;aspirational socialism&quot;, aligning himself with Intern Aware&#x27;s campaign to end unpaid internships. He made policy commitments including the creation of a national care service and replacing inheritance tax with a land value tax. Burnham finished fourth, eliminated on the second ballot with 10.4% of the vote. The leadership contest was won by Ed Miliband.

====Miliband Shadow Cabinet (2010–2015)====
In October 2010, Burnham was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Education and election co-ordinator for the Labour Party. As shadow education secretary, Burnham opposed the coalition government&#x27;s plans for &quot;free schools&quot;. He argued for moving the education system back towards a comprehensive system.
A year later, he was appointed to the role of Shadow Secretary of State for Health, which he held until 2015.

In July 2013 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Burnham&#x27;s staff had edited his Wikipedia page to remove criticisms of his handling of the Stafford Hospital scandal. Burnham&#x27;s office claimed they had removed false statements that had been drawn to their attention.

====Second leadership campaign (2015)====

On 13 May 2015, Burnham announced that he would stand to replace Ed Miliband in the 2015 leadership election. He stressed the need to unite the party and country and &quot;rediscover the beating heart of Labour&quot;.

He attracted press criticism for claiming £17,000 in expenses to rent a London flat, despite owning another within walking distance of the House of Commons. A spokesperson for Burnham said that renting out the original flat was necessary to &quot;cover his costs&quot; as parliamentary rule changes meant he was no longer able to claim for mortgage interest expenses. Burnham was criticised for jokingly saying that Labour should have a woman leader &quot;when the time is right&quot;, with the &quot;New Statesman&quot; saying that he had &quot;tripped over his mouth again&quot;. He also said that he would resign from the Shadow Cabinet if Labour supported leaving NATO, something which Jeremy Corbyn had talked about. Burnham was criticised for refusing to talk to &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper when it emerged he had been interviewed by &quot;The Sun&quot; in his previous run for the Labour leadership, and had been photographed in the back of a cab for the newspaper. Burnham abstained on the government&#x27;s welfare bill, despite having previously described the legislation as &quot;unsupportable&quot;.

Burnham came second to Jeremy Corbyn in the election, with 19% of the vote in the first round, compared to 59% for Corbyn.

====Corbyn Shadow Cabinet (2015–2017)====

In September 2015, Burnham accepted an appointment as shadow home secretary in the first Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn and remained in the role after the 2016 reshuffle.
Burnham opposes the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy; appearing in 2016 alongside the anti-Prevent organisation MEND, Burnham said: &quot;The Prevent duty to report extremist behaviour is today&#x27;s equivalent of internment in Northern Ireland.&quot;

On 27 April 2016, the day after the Hillsborough inquest verdict that found the 96 Hillsborough deaths had occurred as a result of unlawful killing, Burnham made a speech to the House of Commons calling for those responsible to be held to account. Condemning South Yorkshire Police, which had instigated a cover-up in the aftermath of the tragedy, he described the force as being &quot;rotten to the core&quot; while suggesting that the cover-up had been &quot;advanced in the committee rooms of this House and in the press rooms of 10 Downing Street&quot;. The eleven-minute statement drew applause from MPs, a response that is generally against convention at Westminster.

On 25 April 2017, as his final act in Parliament, he delivered an adjournment debate that lasted over an hour on the Contaminated Blood Scandal. Burnham used the debate to present a raft of evidence stating &quot;this scandal amounts to a criminal cover-up on an industrial scale&quot; and that &quot;these are criminal acts&quot;. He said that if the Government did not set up an Investigation into the scandal that he would refer his evidence to the police.

==Mayor of Greater Manchester (2017–present)==
===Candidacy and election===
On 5 May 2016, a spokesperson for Burnham confirmed that he had been approached by party officials in Greater Manchester, asking him to consider resigning from the Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn in order to run in the upcoming mayoral election in 2017. On 18 May 2016, he confirmed that he was running for Mayor. Burnham was selected as the Labour candidate in August 2016. In September 2016, Burnham said that he would resign as Shadow Home Secretary once a replacement had been found, in order to concentrate on his mayoral bid. He was succeeded by Diane Abbott in October. Burnham said, if elected as Greater Manchester&#x27;s mayor, he would resign his seat as the member of parliament for Leigh. However, the 2017 general election was declared a fortnight before the mayoral election; Burnham did not stand as a candidate. 

Burnham was elected to the new role of mayor of Greater Manchester on 5 May 2017. Upon taking office, he became entitled to the style of Mayor. He received 63% of the vote, winning majorities in all ten of Greater Manchester&#x27;s boroughs. In his mayoral victory speech he said that &quot;[politics] has been too London-centric for too long … Greater Manchester is going to take control. We are going to change politics and make it work better for people.&quot;

In the election of 6 May 2021, Burnham was re-elected as mayor, with 67% of the vote on a turnout of 34.7%.

In the 2024 Mayoral election, Burnham was elected for a third term with 63.4% of the vote, on a turnout of 32.5%. Notably, this was the first Greater Manchester Mayoral election to use the first-past-the-post voting system, with Burnham winning every constituency.

===Mayoralty===
The issue of homelessness in Greater Manchester was a major focus of Burnham&#x27;s mayoral campaign. He pledged to donate 15% of his mayoral salary to charities tackling homelessness if elected. After his election he outlined his plan to launch a &quot;homelessness fund&quot;, with money going to homeless charities and mental health and rehabilitation services. He pledged to end rough sleeping in Greater Manchester by 2020, however, in November 2019 he admitted he would miss his target.

====Public transport====
In 2020, Burnham signed off on a new £10 yearly charge for pensioners who wished to continue to use their TFGM travel passes on the region&#x27;s trains and trams. The charge is said to help fund a London-style bus system. Pensioners in London get free travel on all public transport in London from the age of 60, while Burnham kept the Manchester system linked to the much later state pension age.

Burnham pledged to bring Manchester&#x27;s bus network back into public ownership by 2025. The Mayor and Authority&#x27;s plans were legally challenged by bus operators Stagecoach Group and Rotala, but in March 2022 the Mayor and Authority won the case at the High Court. Media analysts commented that the ruling could pave the way for other city regions in England to regulate bus services that had been privatised since the 1980s. Capped fares of £2 for adult single fares were introduced in September 2022, prior to the bus network becoming regulated.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
In March 2020, Burnham called for clearer advice on slowing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, citing his previous experience as health secretary during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. He welcomed the additional measures implemented across Greater Manchester and Lancashire by Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock in July during the pandemic, in the knowledge that (at the time) some areas across North West England had lower infection rates than the rest of the country. On 15 October 2020 Burnham, along with other North West leaders, backed away from government talks to place Greater Manchester in tier 3 – the most restrictive level – of a new three-tier categorisation. He cited the grants system for businesses and 60% furlough scheme for employees as insufficient, saying they would push people into poverty and destitution which would outweigh the impact of the virus if mitigated correctly. Many of the concerns such as the impact on businesses and employees were shared by local Conservative MPs in Greater Manchester and surrounding areas. For his role of securing more money for local Northern communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, he was dubbed the &quot;King of the North&quot; by the media. However he did not secure as much extra money as he had wanted, being forced to lower his request for £90 million to £65 million.

==== Investigations into child sexual exploitation ====
Shortly after first being elected as Mayor in 2017, Burnham initiated a review of historical child sexual abuse allegations in Manchester and Rochdale, later expanding the scope of the investigation to Oldham. Part one of the review (focusing on Manchester) reported in 2020, part two (focusing on Oldham) reported in 2022, part three (focusing on Rochdale) reported in 2023 and part four (led by HMICFRS and covering the whole of Greater Manchester) is due to be published in Summer 2025.

In January 2025, Burnham backed calls for a national public inquiry with limited scope into group-based child sexual exploitation and the power to compel people to give evidence. This came a day after the House of Commons voted against a wrecking amendment to the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill calling for an inquiry. The amendment, proposed by the Conservative Party, had been subject to a whip which prevented Labour MPs from supporting it.

==== Labour leadership speculation ====
Following this perceived success, and several by-election losses for Labour in 2021, Burnham was touted by many commentators as a potential future leader of the party. Burnham dismissed this speculation, calling it &quot;annoying&quot;, but refused to rule out standing in the future. In September 2023, Burnham was ranked twelfth on the &quot;New Statesman&quot; Left Power List, described as a &quot;key dissenter&quot; and a &quot;crucial voice&quot; in the party, as well as a potential future party leader.

==== &quot;Head North&quot; ====
In 2024, Burham co-authored &quot;Head North: A Rallying Cry for a More Equal Britain&quot; with Liverpool&#x27;s metro mayor Steve Rotheram. The book was described by Benjamin Myers for &quot;the Observer&quot; as &quot;offer[ing] hope to the northern regions when it is most needed, and remind[ing] us that those politicians who refuse to toe the party line are often those who history remembers most favourably.&quot; In contrast, it was described by Jonathan Ball in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as simplifying the North–South divide in England to &quot;&#x27;London elite&#x27; vs &#x27;neglected north&#x27; caricatures&quot;.

==Political views==
Burnham has said that he joined the Labour Party at the age of 15 after having been &quot;radicalised&quot; by the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–85). Ideologically, he identifies as a socialist. In his 2010 leadership bid Burnham emphasised his philosophy of &quot;aspirational socialism&quot;, which he described as redistributive, collectivist and internationalist. He is a strong opponent of nationalism, which he has described as an &quot;ugly brand of politics&quot;. In 2020, Iain Martin of &quot;The Times&quot; described Burnham as a &quot;former Blairite&quot; and associated with New Labour. In a 2010 interview with Andrew Marr, Burnham said he was proud of his association with New Labour. As Mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham has rejected the approach taken by New Labour on housing and transport but has remained committed to New Labour&#x27;s &quot;tough on crime&quot; approach. Politically, Burnham places himself on the soft left of the Labour Party. His politics have been described as soft left by a number of media outlets, including the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;LabourList&quot;.

Burnham supports the use of all-women shortlists for parliamentary candidate selections. He is a supporter of LGBT rights and voted in favour of same-sex marriage in 2013. In an interview in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in October 2007, Burnham said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s better when children are in a home where their parents are married&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s not wrong that the tax system should recognise commitment and marriage&quot;.

In his 2015 leadership bid, Burnham pledged to commit Labour to &quot;a policy of progressive renationalisation of the railway system&quot;. Burnham also favours a universal graduate tax to replace student tuition fees, and voted against the most recent increase in fees. He has advocated a National Care Service, integrating care services into the National Health Service. In his leadership bid, Burnham&#x27;s key economic policies included a new levy to fund social care, extending the higher minimum wage to under-25s, and banning zero-hour contracts. Burnham described the mansion tax proposed by Ed Miliband as &quot;the politics of envy&quot;, saying he knew it would lose votes when his mother phoned and told him it represented a return to the 1970s.

Burnham is a strong supporter of devolving power and, in his 2015 leadership campaign, criticised the &quot;Westminster Bubble&quot; – the London-centric focus in British politics and perceived detachment from life outside Westminster. Some opponents and political commentators accused him of being a part of the same bubble he criticises. He views devolution of powers to Greater Manchester (including its elected mayor) as an opportunity for urban regeneration. He also called for a focus on Northern identity. After he was elected as Mayor of Greater Manchester, he described the new powers for northern cities as &quot;the dawn of a new era&quot;. Burnham feels the government does not invest enough money in the North of England, saying: &quot;Almost five years after the government promised us a northern powerhouse, we learn that public spending in the north has fallen while rising in the south. This has got to stop and it is time that the north came to the front of the queue for public investment&quot;.

Burnham voted for Keir Starmer, who went on to win, in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, saying in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;Keir is a brilliant man. The fact he was a former DPP, and came to work in my shadow Home Office team with no airs and graces says a lot about Keir Starmer.&quot; Starmer went on to win the 2024 general election, returning Labour to government. Burnham was a panelist the &quot;Sky News&quot; coverage of the election, and called Jacob Rees-Mogg losing North East Somerset and Hanham to Labour&#x27;s Dan Norris a Portillo moment that came shortly after Labour reached the 326 seats needed for a majority. Burnham was among a group of mayors to meet Starmer and Angela Rayner in Downing Street.

Burnham is a supporter of an elected House of Lords and for switching elections to the House of Commons to a form of proportional representation.

==Personal life==
Burnham married Marie-France van Heel, who is Dutch, in 2000, having been in a relationship since university. The couple have a son and two daughters. 

Burnham was brought up as a Roman Catholic. In the 2015 leadership contest he praised Pope Francis, but urged him to promote a progressive stance on gay rights. In a newspaper interview during the contest he stated that he had been repeatedly at odds with the Catholic Church all the time that he had been an MP and that this had resulted in strained personal relationships. Burnham has a brother, Nick, who is the principal of Cardinal Newman College in Preston.

Burnham is a supporter of rugby league and was the honorary chairman of Leigh Centurions for a short time and is now an honorary vice-president. Burnham was a talented junior cricketer (playing for Lancashire CCC Juniors) and keen footballer, and competed at both sports for his college. He has played for Labour&#x27;s &quot;Demon Eyes&quot; football team and is a lifelong fan of Premier League football club Everton. In July 2003, Burnham played for Conference club Leigh RMI in a pre-season friendly against Everton. He came on as an 88th minute substitute for Neil Robinson in the 1–1 draw at Hilton Park. His entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; lists his recreations as football (Everton F.C.), Rugby league (Leigh RLC) and cricket.

In December 2017 it was announced that Burnham would succeed Dean Andrew as president of the Rugby Football League in July 2018. Burnham was replaced by Tony Adams as president of the league in the summer of 2019.

Burnham was ordered to pay £1,984 in fines, charges, and costs and given six penalty points after he had admitted to speeding on a section of road with a temporarily lowered speed limit in July 2022.

==In media==
Burnham was portrayed by Matthew McNulty in &quot;Anne&quot; (2022), an ITV miniseries about the Hillsborough disaster.

Burns resigned from being Minister of State for Transport in October 2013 to stand in the First Deputy Chairmen of Ways and Means by-election following the resignation of Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans.

Returned to Parliament as a Conservative MP in the 2015 election, he was knighted in the 2015 Birthday Honours. Burns announced in January 2016 that he would not be standing at the next general election, reaffirmed when the 2017 general election was declared.

==Early life and education==
Born on 6 September 1952 in Nottingham, Burns was educated at Christ the King School in Accra, then Stamford School in Lincolnshire, before going up to Worcester College, Oxford, to read Modern History, graduating with a BA (Hons) (&quot;Third-class honours, resulting in his nickname &quot;third degree burns&quot;&quot;) in 1975. He has also received an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy (Hon. PhD) from Anglia Ruskin University.

Burns cites following the Kennedy administration in the early 1960s as the point where he became interested in politics, saying &quot;As you looked around the world you had a prime minister in Britain who was about 69, a president in France in his mid-70s and a chancellor in West Germany in his 80s. [Kennedy] had a glamorous family, and conveyed the impression that you could actually do something in politics to improve the lives of citizens. I thought that was cool, and decided that public service would be fantastic&quot;.

==Political career==
Before beginning his degree at Oxford, Burns spent nine months in the United States working for Senator George McGovern&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign against President Richard Nixon in 1972. Following the Watergate scandal and Nixon&#x27;s subsequent resignation in 1974, Burns would comment that McGovern&#x27;s campaign had &quot;won the argument, even if we lost the vote&quot;.

From 1975 to 1980, Burns was political adviser to Rt Hon Sally Oppenheim (now Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes). From 1980 to 1983 he was a journalist and served as a director of &quot;What To Buy for Business&quot; magazine, before working from 1983 to 1987 for the Institute of Directors Policy Executive.

Burns has been active in domestic politics since 1970, when he was a founder member of the Rutland and Stamford Young Conservatives, having been founding chairman of Stamford School CPC. From 1973 to 1975, he was a committee member, Political Action Officer and Secretary of Oxford University Conservative Association, and a member of the Oxford Union. From 1977 to 1981, he was Treasurer for Southfields Ward and an executive council member of Putney Conservative Association.

In 1983, he was the Conservative Party candidate in Alyn and Deeside (Flintshire, Wales) where he reduced Labour&#x27;s majority from 6,800 to 1,368. In 1986, he was elected Chairman of Avonmore Ward, Fulham Conservative Association.

Burns was sworn of the Privy Council in February 2011.

Burns was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. In 2013 Burns voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

===Election results===
At the 2005 general election, Burns gained 22,946 votes (44.9%) and a majority of 9,620 (18.8%). The number of votes cast for Burns in 2005 was an increase of 2.4% from the previous general election in 2001. His majority also increased from 6,261 to 9,620. Turnout was 61.9%, down from 62.5% in 2001. At the 2010 general election, Burns gained 25,207 votes (46.2%), winning a majority over the Liberal Democrat candidate by 5,110 (9.4%).

At the 2015 general election, Burns gained 27,732 votes (51.5%), winning the seat with a majority over Chris Vince, the Labour candidate, of 18,250 (33.9%).

==Controversies==

In 2007, Burns persuaded the House of Commons Administration Committee, then being a member, that parliamentarians should have &quot;priority access&quot; to services within the Parliamentary Estate. In practice, this meant that MPs and Peers could avoid queues for shops, restaurants, bars, computers, photocopiers and even toilets by &quot;pushing in&quot; ahead of visitors or staff. The so-called &quot;queue jumping rule&quot; provoked cross-party opposition from Commons staff and other MPs but Burns trenchantly defended the proposal.

On 3 April 2008, Burns was involved in a collision with a cyclist as he drove his 4x4 out of the Palace of Westminster gates into Parliament Square. The cyclist, British Army Major Stuart Lane, was thrown over the handlebars of his bicycle and broke two vertebrae in his neck &quot;which could have hindered his Army career&quot;.
In February 2009 Burns pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving and was fined £400 with £200 costs at the City of Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court.

On 29 June 2010, Burns called Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, who stands at 5&#x27;6&quot;, a &quot;stupid, sanctimonious dwarf&quot; during a debate.

In November 2011, Burns compared members of the campaigning group 38 Degrees to zombies, which led to an open letter of complaint to Burns with over 85,000 signatures.

In January 2013, Burns, when the minister overseeing rail fares, was revealed as having been making use of a ministerial car instead of travelling the 35 miles from his home in Essex to London by train. He claimed this was because he was not allowed to read sensitive papers on the train, but his claim was immediately contradicted by the Cabinet Office, although it was conceded that reading Red box matters in such an environment was not advisable. The cost to the taxpayer was estimated to be £80,000 per annum.

==Personal life==

Burns was married to Emma Clifford from 1982 until their divorce in 2000; they have two children.

He is a second cousin of David Bowie.

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 2015, Sir Simon was appointed a Knight Bachelor &quot;for parliamentary and political service&quot;.

Despite his conservative views, Burns is a &quot;proud&quot; supporter of the more liberal-leaning U.S. Democratic Party. Citing the big tent nature of American political parties, he argues &quot;You can&#x27;t just say that, because you’re a British Conservative, so you have to be a [U.S.] Republican. American politics isn’t contained in that way. Turn the clock back to the 1970s, and the Democrat Party went from the liberal Kennedy wing right through to the out-and-out racists in the Southern states. The Republican Party had its liberal wing – people like John Lindsay, Chuck Percy and Nelson Rockefeller.&quot;

<text>Tung-Yen Lin (; November 14, 1912 – November 15, 2003) was a Chinese-American structural engineer who was the pioneer of standardizing the use of prestressed concrete.

==Biography==
Born in Fuzhou, China, as the fourth of eleven children, he was raised in Beijing where his father was a justice of the ROC&#x27;s Supreme Court. He did not begin formal schooling until age 11, and only so because his parents forged his birth year to be 1911 so that he would qualify. At only 14, entered Jiaotong University&#x27;s Tangshan Engineering College (now Southwest Jiaotong University), having earned the top score in math and the second best score overall in the college entrance exams for his entering class. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering in 1931 and left for the United States, where he earned his master&#x27;s degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1933. Lin&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis was the first student thesis published by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
Lin returned to China after graduation to work with the Chinese Ministry of Railways. Before too long he earned the reputation of being a &quot;good engineer&quot;. This positioned him to become the chief bridge engineer of the Yunnan-Chongqing Railway and oversaw the design and construction of more than 1,000 bridges. He returned to UC Berkeley to join its faculty in 1946, and began to research and develop the practice of prestressed concrete. He did not invent prestressed concrete, but he did develop it for practical use. The inventor of prestressed concrete is Eugene Freyssinet of France. Lin retired in 1976 to work full-time at T.Y. Lin International, a firm he founded in 1954. After selling that firm, he left it to found Lin Tung-Yen China on June 1, 1992, which oversees engineering projects in China.

When Lin received the National Medal of Science from President Ronald Reagan in 1986, he handed over a 16-page plan for a bridge linking Alaska and Siberia across the Bering Strait, a project he dubbed the Intercontinental Peace Bridge. He also proposed a bridge across the Strait of Gibraltar that would have spans and tall towers. Lin was also the first recipient of the A.S.C.E. lifetime achievement in design award, and the society renamed the prestressed concrete award to the T.Y. Lin award.

Engineers were often architects in the early 1900s, but by the late 1940s, this aspect of engineering had been all but forgotten. Lin was saddened by this situation commenting:

Lin fought against the pressures of economy by incorporating more aesthetics into his bridges and developing new techniques that increased economy. Lin believed that &quot;engineering approach should be a global vision of the bridge. To fit the environment and to express the structural forces and moments, and nature itself.&quot; Attention had to be paid not only to the details of the bridge, but also to the surrounding landscape. Pre-stressing the concrete allowed Lin to accomplish the goal of incorporating unique shapes without sacrificing the bottom line.

Among his engineering accomplishments were the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco, the Kuan Du Bridge in Taiwan, and the roof of the National Racetrack in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1996, he was named the 53rd National Honor Member of Chi Epsilon, the national civil engineering honor society.

He died of a heart attack at age 91. His El Cerrito, California home is the world&#x27;s first residential structure made of prestressed concrete. His home features a dance floor serving as monument to his favorite pastime, dancing. His widow, Margaret Kao Lin is also the daughter of a former ROC supreme court justice.

<text>In geometry, a nonagon () or enneagon () is a nine-sided polygon or 9-gon.

The name &quot;nonagon&quot; is a prefix hybrid formation, from Latin (&quot;nonus&quot;, &quot;ninth&quot; + &quot;gonon&quot;), used equivalently, attested already in the 16th century in French &quot;nonogone&quot; and in English from the 17th century. The name &quot;enneagon&quot; comes from Greek &quot;enneagonon&quot; (εννεα, &quot;nine&quot; + γωνον (from γωνία = &quot;corner&quot;)), and is arguably more correct, though less common.

== Regular nonagon ==
A &quot;regular nonagon&quot; is represented by Schläfli symbol {9} and has internal angles of 140°. The area of a regular nonagon of side length &quot;a&quot; is given by
:formula_1
:::formula_2

where the radius &quot;r&quot; of the inscribed circle of the regular nonagon is

:formula_3

and where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of its circumscribed circle:

:formula_4

==Construction==
Although a regular nonagon is not constructible with compass and straightedge (as 9 = 32, which is not a product of distinct Fermat primes), there are very old methods of construction that produce very close approximations.

It can be also constructed using neusis, or by allowing the use of an angle trisector.

== Symmetry ==
The &quot;regular enneagon&quot; has Dih9 symmetry, order 18. There are 2 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih3 and Dih1, and 3 cyclic group symmetries: Z9, Z3, and Z1.

These 6 symmetries can be seen in 6 distinct symmetries on the enneagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r18 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g9 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

== Tilings ==

The regular enneagon can tessellate the euclidean tiling with gaps. These gaps can be filled with regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. In the notation of symmetrohedron this tiling is called H(*;3;*;[2]) with H representing *632 hexagonal symmetry in the plane.

==Graphs==
The K9 complete graph is often drawn as a &quot;regular enneagon&quot; with all 36 edges connected. This graph also represents an orthographic projection of the 9 vertices and 36 edges of the 8-simplex.

==Pop culture references==
*They Might Be Giants have a song entitled &quot;Nonagon&quot; on their children&#x27;s album &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot;. It refers to both an attendee at a party at which &quot;everybody in the party is a many-sided polygon&quot; and a dance they perform at this party.
*Slipknot&#x27;s logo is also a version of a nonagon, being a nine-pointed star made of three triangles, referring to the nine members.
*King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard have an album titled &#x27;Nonagon Infinity&#x27;, the album art featuring a nonagonal complete graph. The album consists of nine songs and repeats cyclically.
==Architecture==
Temples of the Baháʼí Faith, called Baháʼí Houses of Worship, are required to be nonagonal.

<doc id="414825" wikidata="Q338273" url="?curid=414825" title="David Burnside">
<text>David Wilson Boyd Burnside (born 24 August 1951) is an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Antrim from 2001 to 2005.

Burnside was also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for South Antrim from 2003 to 2009.

In the 1970s Burnside served as press officer for the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, and he unsuccessfully contested North Antrim for the party at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election. After the collapse of Vanguard he joined the Ulster Unionist Party, standing unsuccessfully in the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly but then took a back seat from politics for many years while working as a prominent public relations consultant based in London which led him to set up his own PR company. He also served in the Ulster Defence Regiment.

Since 2015 he has been a member of the Steering Committee of the Constitution Reform Group (CRG), a cross-party pressure group chaired by Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury, which seeks a new constitutional settlement in the UK. The Constitution Reform Group&#x27;s Act of Union Bill 2018
was introduced as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill by Lord Lisvane in the House of Lords on 9 October 2018, when it received a formal first reading. The bill has been described by the BBC as &quot;one to watch&quot; in the current Parliament.

==British Airways==
In 1984 Burnside was recruited by the British Airways Chairman Lord King to become the company&#x27;s head of public relations. In this role Burnside is widely acknowledged to have become one of the most powerful PR men in Britain, speaking for King, administering a £5 million budget and receiving numerous PR awards both in the UK and around the world.

His success is perhaps overshadowed by the nature of his departure. British Airways was witnessing the emergence of a potentially strong rival, Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Atlantic. Virgin, which began with one route and one Boeing 747 in 1984 was beginning to emerge as a serious threat on some of BA&#x27;s most lucrative routes.

Following Virgin&#x27;s highly publicized mission of mercy to Iraq to fly home hostages who had been held by Saddam Hussein in 1991, Lord King is reported to have told Burnside and CEO Colin Marshall to &quot;do something about Branson&quot;. This began the campaign of &quot;dirty tricks&quot;, which ended in Branson suing King and British Airways for libel in 1992. King countersued Branson and the case went to trial in 1993. British Airways, faced with likely defeat, settled the case giving £500,000 to Branson and a further £110,000 to his airline; further, BA was to pay the legal fees of up to £3 million. 

It was an article written by Burnside (given legal clearance) in &quot;BA News&quot;, the company&#x27;s in house newsletter, that prompted Branson&#x27;s legal action. Following the case Burnside was awarded a settlement of approximately £400,000 and free first class travel on BA for four years. 

==Return to politics==

Along with several prominent current Ulster Unionist politicians, Burnside was a member of the Vanguard Movement. He was press officer for the organisation from 1974 to 1977.
He was selected to defend the South Antrim constituency for the Ulster Unionists in a by-election in 2000, but narrowly lost to the Democratic Unionist Party candidate Rev. Willie McCrea.

However he reversed this defeat in the 2001 general election. Along with Jeffrey Donaldson (MP) and the Rev. Martin Smyth (MP), Burnside became an outspoken critic of his party leader, David Trimble&#x27;s support for the Good Friday Agreement, arguing that the Provisional IRA&#x27;s slow pace of decommissioning its arms meant that Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, should not be allowed to serve in the power-sharing government.

On 23 June 2003, Burnside, Donaldson and Smyth resigned the UUP whip in the House of Commons, launching a strong attack on Trimble&#x27;s leadership. The trio successfully fought off attempts to discipline them using the courts and in November 2003 both Burnside and Donaldson were elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, Burnside declined to follow Donaldson when he resigned from the Ulster Unionist Party in December 2003. In 2005 he lost his Westminster Parliamentary seat. Burnside successfully retained his Assembly seat in March 2007. He declined to contest the 2005 leadership election.

Burnside resigned as an Assembly Member in June 2009 to concentrate on his business interests. His seat was taken by Antrim councillor Danny Kinahan.

David Burnside was revealed to have taken a group of prominent Russians, including a close ally of Vladimir Putin, to the 2013 Conservative summer fundraising party and introduced them to David Cameron.

==Rangers Football Club==

Burnside was linked to a potential Rangers takeover in 2007 but nothing came of it. There was not enough investment available for the move.

<doc id="414827" wikidata="Q269977" url="?curid=414827" title="Paul Burstow">
<text>Paul Kenneth Burstow (born 13 May 1962) is a British former politician who served as the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Sutton and Cheam for 18 years, from 1997 to 2015, when he was defeated by Paul Scully.

He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in May 2010, and served in that position until September 2012.

==Early life==
Burstow was born in Carshalton in Surrey, son of a tailor, and was educated at Glastonbury High School for Boys, a former boys&#x27; secondary modern school in Carshalton, followed by Carshalton College and the South Bank Polytechnic, where he obtained a degree in business studies. He started his career as a buying assistant with Allied Shoe Repairs in 1985. The following year he worked briefly in print sales with KallKwik Printers, before becoming a research assistant at the London Borough of Hounslow in 1987.

===Politics before parliament===
He was elected as a councillor for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the Sutton Borough Council in 1986, and was its deputy leader from 1994 to 1997. Burstow remained a councillor for the Rosehill ward in Sutton until 2002, after his election to Parliament.

In 1988, he joined the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors as a campaigns officer; he then became its political secretary in 1996, where he remained until becoming an MP.

==Election and parliamentary career==
Burstow first contested the Sutton and Cheam Parliamentary seat for the Liberal Democrats at the 1992 General Election. He was defeated by the Conservative Lady Olga Maitland despite achieving one of the largest swings to the Liberal Democrats in London at that election.

He contested the seat again in 1997, this time being elected as its Liberal Democrat MP with a majority of 2,097. Burstow joined several other new Liberal Democrat MPs, for the party gained many other south-west London seats at that election.

He made his maiden speech on 16 May 1997, speaking passionately about the needs of blind and disabled people. On his election, Burstow immediately became a party spokesman on the Environment under Paddy Ashdown. He became the spokesman on Social Security in 1999, on the election of Charles Kennedy as the Leader of the Liberal Democrats.

After the 2001 general election, Burstow became the Health spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. He was promoted to the Liberal Democrat Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Secretary of State for Health in 2003. He stepped down from the Liberal Democrat Shadow Cabinet following the 2005 general election, but was appointed as the spokesman on London. On 22 March 2006, Liberal Democrat MPs elected him their Chief Whip. In that role he oversaw a number of reforms of the whips operation.

In 2003, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Burstow as &quot;One of the most knowledgeable and effective politicians on older people&#x27;s issues&quot;. He was voted by MPs as older people&#x27;s champion in the epolitix Charity Champion awards in December 2005.

===Minister of State===
At the 2010 general election Burstow was re-elected MP for Sutton and Cheam with a slim majority of 1,608 votes. He was then appointed Minister of State in the Department of Health in the coalition government. He was responsible for care services and the elderly, long term conditions and mental health. He was responsible for developing the Government&#x27;s mental health strategy and drafting the care provisions of the Care Act. Burstow left the government in September 2012, and was succeeded as Care Minister by Norman Lamb.

==Subsequent career==
Between 2012 and 2015, when he left Parliament, Burstow led a number of influential policy commissions. Working with the think tank Demos Demos he led a commission into the future models of residential care for people in later life.

He was appointed Chair of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust from November 2015 to June 2022. He was also invited to become a Trustee of Action on Smoking and Health in 2015 stepping down in 2022.

In 2016 he became a part-time professor of mental health policy at the University of Birmingham where he led a policy commission which made recommendations for a public health approach to improving the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people, Investing in a Resilient Generation.

Burstow&#x27;s interest in social care saw him appointed as Chair of the Social Care Institute for Excellence in July 2017 where he has worked to refresh the board of Trustees, appoint a new Chief Executive and develop the organisation&#x27;s business strategy and deliver a financial turnaround .

He was appointed as chair of the charity St Andrew&#x27;s Healthcare in September 2020. At the charity he has reshaped and strengthened the Board, appointed a new Chief Executive and promoted collaborative working with NHS mental health providers in the East and West Midlands to address a number of longstanding quality challenges.

In 2022 Burstow was appointed as one of the 42 Integrated Care Board Chairs. He has helped to shape the system partnership across Hertfordshire and West Essex and overseen the appointment of the new Board and is working with local government, NHS and CVFSE partners to develop a 10 year strategy and 5 year joint plan to improve the health and wellbeing of the local population.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Burstow, a Liberal Democrat councillor for Cheam, in 1995; they have a son and two daughters. His interests include cooking, reading, and walking.

<doc id="414829" wikidata="Q7722587" url="?curid=414829" title="The Chipettes">
<text>The Chipettes are a fictional girl group from the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; franchise consisting of three female anthropomorphic chipmunk singers: Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, alongside their adoptive human mother, Beatrice Miller. They first appeared in the animated television series &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; in 1983. In this and related materials, the Chipettes served as female featured characters in their own right, starring in numerous episodes. The title of the show was changed from &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; to simply &quot;The Chipmunks&quot; in 1988 to reflect this. In the animated television series and the 1987 animated film &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot;, all of the Chipettes were voiced by their creator, Janice Karman, the wife of Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (son of Ross Bagdasarian, who created the Chipmunks). Karman also wrote and voiced the Chipettes&#x27; dialogue on their studio albums, while studio singers Susan Boyd, Shelby Daniel and Katherine Coon provided their singing voices. In the animated television series &quot;Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks&quot;, Eleanor is voiced by Vanessa Bagdasarian, the daughter of Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and Janice Karman.

The first designs for the Chipettes were drafted by Corny Cole for their 1983 cartoon series debut. These designs were later revamped by Sandra Berez for &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot; and the later seasons of the show.

==Origins==
The origins of the Chipettes can be traced to the 1982 Alvin and the Chipmunks album &quot;The Chipmunks Go Hollywood&quot;. On this album, Alvin sings a duet with a female character billed as Charlene the Chipette. Charlene is featured on the song &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; from the soundtrack of the motion picture &quot;Grease&quot;. Charlene was depicted on the album cover as having a long, golden blonde ponytail, and seems to have been the basis for the later character of Brittany. Janice Karman said in interviews that she created the Chipettes because she and Ross Bagdasarian Jr. couldn&#x27;t do girl songs and wanted Chipmunks who are females and have counter personalities of the main three Chipmunks. The first Chipette she created was Brittany in 1982.

The Chipettes, redesigned as far more realistic chipmunks, appear in &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot;. In the film, Christina Applegate, Anna Faris, and Amy Poehler voices the Chipettes. &quot;There has been a lot of talk about it,&quot; noted Janice Karman, one of the film&#x27;s producers. &quot;A lot of people have been asking about the little girls.&quot; Christina Applegate, Anna Faris, and Amy Poehler reprised their roles from the previous film, &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked&quot;, which was released on December 16, 2011. The Chipettes also appeared in &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&quot;, released in 2015; Christina Applegate and Anna Faris again voice Brittany and Jeanette respectively, but Kaley Cuoco replaces Amy Poehler as the voice of Eleanor.

==Discography==
With the exception of 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot; soundtrack (LP) and 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Chipmunks and the Chipettes: Born to Rock&quot;, the discography of the Chipettes consists of featured appearances on Alvin and the Chipmunks recordings.

<doc id="414830" wikidata="Q270009" url="?curid=414830" title="Alistair Burt">
<text>Alistair James Hendrie Burt (born 25 May 1955) is a Conservative British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Bedfordshire from 2001 until 2019. He was previously MP for his native Bury North in Greater Manchester from 1983 until 1997. Burt was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State then Minister of State at the Department of Social Security from 1992 to 1997, and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 2010 to 2013. Burt was also Minister of State at the Department of Health from May 2015 to July 2016.

First elected as a Conservative, Burt had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019. On 29 October he was one of ten Conservative MPs to have the whip restored. He retired at the 2019 general election.

In September 2020 he was appointed as Pro-Chancellor of Lancaster University, succeeding Lord Liddle.

==Early life and education==
Alistair Burt was born in Bury, Lancashire, and was educated at the Bury Grammar School, where he was appointed Head Boy in 1973. He read Jurisprudence at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, graduating in 1977. Whilst a student at Oxford, Burt attended the televised 1975 &quot;A Question of Europe&quot; debate wearing the stereotyped French dress of a beret, striped shirt, and string of onions. He was elected president of the Oxford Law Society in 1976. He became an articled clerk with Slater Heelis &amp; Co. of Manchester in 1978, becoming a solicitor with Watts Vallence &amp; Vallence in 1980 where he remained until 1983.

==Early parliamentary career==
Burt was elected as a councillor on Haringey Borough Council in 1982 and left the council in 1984. He contested the new seat of Bury North at the 1983 general election at which he was elected as the Conservative MP with a majority of 2,792 votes. He represented the seat until 1997 and returned to parliament again in 2001.

In Parliament Alistair Burt became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for the Environment Kenneth Baker in 1985, he remained as PPS to Baker in his role as Secretary of State for Education and Science from 1986 and in his role as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1989 until 1990. Following the 1992 general election Burt was promoted to the government of John Major and became the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security where he remained until 1995, when he was promoted further with the rank of Minister of State at the same department. He was one of many ministers who lost their seats at the 1997 general election when Bury North fell to Labour&#x27;s David Chaytor by 7,866 votes. From 1997 to 2001, he worked at executive search firm Whitehead Mann GKR.

==Opposition years==
Alistair Burt re-entered parliament at the 2001 general election for the very safe Conservative seat of Bedfordshire North East, previously represented in parliament by the former Attorney General Nicholas Lyell who had retired. Burt was elected with a majority of 8,577; he was made an opposition spokesman on Education and Skills under William Hague in 2001, before becoming PPS to the Leader of the Opposition Iain Duncan Smith in 2002. The following year, Burt carried on as PPS to the new leader Michael Howard.

Following the 2005 general election, he rejoined the front bench and was a spokesman on Local Government Affairs and Communities. However, in January 2008, Burt was promoted to Assistant Chief Whip and Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party with responsibility for Internal Development.

Burt is a former officer of the Conservative Friends of Israel, a position which he resigned upon entering government as a Minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In December 2008, he led an all-Party group meeting with the Red Cross to campaign for visiting rights for the Israeli hostage Gilad Shalit. He is a member of the Political Council of the Henry Jackson Society. He is also joint founder and first Chairman of The Enterprise Forum, an organisation set up in 1997 to facilitate discussions on policy between the Business Community and the Conservative Party. He is a vice-president of the Tory Reform Group.

==Cameron–Clegg ministry==

Burt was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on 14 May 2010. His roles there included overseeing British-Syria policy for three years that included the start of the Syrian civil war, and leading on Israeli issues for the government at the United Nations. Burt was angered at the failure of MPs in August 2013 to support the British government&#x27;s plan to participate in military strikes against the Syrian government, in the wake of a chemical-weapons attack at Ghouta. He stepped down on 7 October 2013. Burt had been delegated under William Hague specific responsibilities for advancing FCO policy on:
*Afghanistan and South Asia
*Middle East and North Africa
*North America
*Counter terrorism
*Counter proliferation
*FCO finance
*Human resources and diversity

After standing down from the FCO, Burt was made a Privy Councillor on 16 October 2013, and in December that year, was appointed a Commissioner of the International Commission on Missing Persons.

===Critic of Syria policy===

As a former minister, he was freed to argue that the parliamentary vote against taking military action in Syria was a bad precedent, and it would be better if the government made decisions such as this in future by &quot;executive action&quot;. In June 2014 Burt called the lack of intervention in Syria &quot;a disaster&quot;.

==Cameron ministry==
Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 general election on 11 May, Burt returned to Government as Minister of State for Community and Social Care in the Department of Health.

As a Conservative health minister, he blocked a new law to provide cheap and effective drugs for the NHS by championing medicines whose patents have expired. Burt spoke in Parliament for nearly half an hour to filibuster the proposed Off-Patent Drugs Bill, a plan that had cross-party support from backbenchers. He said “It is not always the case that something brought forward by a charity and advocated passionately by colleagues is always the answer. It&#x27;s not disgraceful – it&#x27;s the right answer.” The Bill was subsequently revised and placed into law with agreement from all sides on the issue 
As the Minister of State for Community and Social Care, he announced on 17 July 2015 that the implementation of the cap on care costs would be delayed until April 2020. The introduction of the cap had been passed into law as part of the Care Act 2014 during the coalition government, and implementation of that part of the law from 2016 onwards had been accepted by all main political parties during the general election of 2015.

==Later parliamentary career==
In July 2016, Burt announced that he would be resigning from his Ministerial position, &quot;Twenty-four years and one month ago, I answered my first question as a junior minister in oral questions and I’ve just completed my last oral questions,&quot; Burt said. It was made clear that his resignation was not related to Brexit.

Historically Burt had been active in seeking justice for the victims of the Tainted Blood Scandal. In November 2016, following his departure from a ministerial post he made a passionate speech to Parliament in order to layout events stating: &quot;In June 2015, I was re-invited by the then Prime Minister to join the Government in the Department of Health, at which point I went quiet on campaigning as far as the public were concerned. I know that some people misinterpreted that. My position in the Department of Health was not conditional on the fact that I had been involved with contaminated blood, and neither was my position in the Foreign Office or my decision to leave the Department of Health of my own accord earlier this year. However, the ministerial convention is clear: Ministers say only what the Government&#x27;s position is. We cannot have two colleagues firing away on the same issues, so I did indeed go quiet publicly for a period&quot;.

===Foreign and Commonwealth Office===
In Theresa May&#x27;s reshuffle following the 2017 election, Burt accepted his old post back at the Foreign Office. The role is a shared one, with Burt also being Minister in the Department for International Development. Burt resigned from government by voting for Oliver Letwin&#x27;s amendment on 25 March 2019.

====Support of Yemen policy====
Burt defended the British involvement in the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis. He said that the United Kingdom &quot;remains committed to supporting Saudi Arabia to address its legitimate security needs.&quot;

===Sitting as an independent===

On 3 September 2019, Burt joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion which subsequently failed. Effectively, they helped block Johnson&#x27;s no-deal Brexit plan from proceeding on 31 October. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs and requiring them to sit as independents. If they had decided to run for re-election in a future election, the party would have blocked their selection as Conservative candidates. Burt himself, however, decided that he would not seek re-election at the next general election. He was readmitted to the Conservative Party alongside nine other MPs on 29 October, before the general election took place, which he chose not to contest.

==Funding and expenses==
In 2009, Burt was found to have over-claimed for rent by £1,000, but was not required to return the money as he was not claiming expenses for food.

==Personal life==
Burt married Eve Alexandra Twite in 1983 in Haringey. Burt is an active Christian. He enjoys athletics and football, and supports Bury F.C. He is a member of Biggleswade Athletics Club, and has run many London Marathons and Harrold Pit Runs.

<text>Sir John Valentine Butterfill (14 February 1941 – 7 November 2021) was a British Conservative politician and businessman who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bournemouth West from 1983 until he stood down at the 2010 general election.

== Early life and career ==

Born in Surrey, Butterfill was educated at Caterham School and the College of Estate Management in London. In 1962, he began his career as a valuer with Jones Lang Wootton before becoming a senior executive with the Hammerson Group in 1964. He was a director at the Audley Properties Group (now the Bovis Homes Group) from 1969 until he became the managing director of the St Paul&#x27;s Securities Group. He became a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 1974. 

He was elected as the chairman of the Guildford Conservative Association from 1976 to 1982. In 1977 he became a senior partner in Curchod &amp; Co Chartered Surveyors, where he remained until 1992. He was the director of ISLEF Building and Construction Ltd from 1985 to 1991 and the Pavilion Services Group from 1992 to 1994.

== Parliamentary career ==

In 1979, Butterfill contested London South East Inner at the European Parliamentary election but was defeated comfortably by Labour&#x27;s Richard Balfe. He was selected to contest the Croydon North West by-election in 1981, which was caused by the death of Conservative MP Robert Taylor. 

It came as a great surprise when Bill Pitt won the seat for the Liberal Party, on a 24% swing and with a majority of 3,254. He was subsequently chosen to contest the south-coast seat of Bournemouth West on the retirement of the veteran MP John Eden. Butterfill won the seat at the 1983 general election with a majority of 13,331 and remained the MP until 2010.

Butterfill remained a backbencher for the entirety of his parliamentary career. He was the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Energy, Cecil Parkinson, in 1988, remaining Parkinson&#x27;s PPS when he became the Secretary of State for Transport in 1989. His job ended when Parkinson resigned from the Cabinet at the election of John Major to succeed Margaret Thatcher in 1990.

Butterfill served on many select committees during his more than 20-year Westminster career. He was responsible for introducing many acts of Parliament including the Registered Homes (Amendment) Act 1991, the Insolvency Act 1994, and the Policyholders Protection Act 1997. 

In 1995, he entered a bill to place the UK in Central European Time. It was opposed by many Scottish MPs.

He introduced the Financial Mutuals Arrangements Bill, which was renamed and became the Building Societies (Funding) and Mutual Societies (Transfers) Act 2007.

=== Expenses ===

In May 2009, as part of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; publication of details, the newspaper revealed that for five years, Butterfill owned a six-bedroom country house in Woking, Surrey, 80 miles from his constituency. At the time, he designated a small flat in his Bournemouth constituency, bought for £56,000, as his &quot;main home&quot;. Said by Butterfill to have been purchased as a wreck, he submitted regular claims under the second home allowance for the cost of running the Woking house, which had a swimming pool and extensive grounds. This included £17,000 on servants&#x27; quarters alone, contributing up to £1,778 a month towards the mortgage interest, and was also reimbursed for council tax bills for the &quot;staff annex&quot;, where his housekeeper and odd-job man lived.

Butterfill repaid £17,479 in discretionary repayments to the government related to the expenses row. However, Butterfill was only over-paid by a total of £2,032.47 for mortgage interest (£1,408 in 2006–07 and £625 in 2008–09). He was also overpaid by a total of £332 for council tax in 2005–06 (of which £47.66 was due to payments not being reduced for dissolution and £284.00 due to an incorrect adjustment when moving house). The total repayment recommended was £2,364.

== &quot;Dispatches&quot; lobbyist investigation ==

Butterfill was one of the MPs named in a 2010 sting operation. Butterfill allegedly told an undercover reporter that he would lobby to benefit a fictitious company and use his political connections for a payment of £35,000 a year. Butterfill was also seen on the &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme saying he had been one of the four people who persuaded David Cameron to stand for leader of the Conservative Party and that it was likely that he (Butterfill) would be made a peer and go to the House of Lords. The following day the Conservative Party leader David Cameron said: &quot;I can tell you that is not going to happen.&quot;

In the final report of the Standards Commissioner, it was deemed that Butterfill did not breach parliamentary rules: 

== Personal life ==
He married Pamela Ross-Symons in 1965 in Surrey, and they had a son and three daughters. He was awarded a knighthood in the 2004 New Year Honours for &quot;services to Parliament.&quot; He was a council member of the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals. His constituency included the centre of Bournemouth.

Butterfill died in Hampshire on 7 November 2021, at the age of 80.

<doc id="414848" wikidata="Q483507" url="?curid=414848" title="Kelly Clarkson">
<text>Kelly Brianne (born Kelly Brianne Clarkson, April 24, 1982), known professionally as Kelly Clarkson, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. Rising to fame as the inaugural winner of &quot;American Idol&quot;, she has established a multi-decade career in music and television, which is credited for giving lasting impact on televised talent shows. Known as a vocal powerhouse and versatile performer, she was named one of the greatest singers in history by publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;.

Signed to RCA Records in 2002, Clarkson released her chart-topping debut single, &quot;A Moment Like This&quot;, which became the US best-selling single of the year. Her R&amp;B and gospel-influenced debut album, &quot;Thankful&quot; (2003), entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one. Clarkson shifted genres to pop rock for &quot;Breakaway&quot; (2004), one of the 21st century&#x27;s best-selling albums. Its singles, &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, were among the top-ten biggest songs of 2005 in the US, while &quot;Because of You&quot; topped the charts in Europe. After the lukewarm reception to &quot;My December&quot; (2007), with its darker rock music, Clarkson returned to radio-friendly pop rock sounds with &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; (2009) and &quot;Stronger&quot; (2011), which each produced number-one singles &quot;My Life Would Suck Without You&quot; and &quot;Stronger (What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You)&quot;.

Clarkson ventured into Christmas music with &quot;Wrapped in Red&quot; (2013), which became the best-selling holiday album of the year and featured &quot;Underneath the Tree&quot;, the ASCAP&#x27;s most popular Christmas song released in the 21st century. Following the release of the number-one album &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; (2015), she signed with Atlantic Records and recorded three further albums titled &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; (2017), &quot;When Christmas Comes Around...&quot; (2021), and &quot;Chemistry&quot; (2023). Clarkson returned to television as a coach on &quot;The Voice&quot; for nine seasons between 2018 and 2023. She remains the female coach with the most winning contestants (four) in the show&#x27;s history. Since 2019, she has hosted her own talk show, &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot;.

With over 82 million records worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brathwaite_9/19/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clarkson has received various accolades, including three Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, four American Music Awards, eight Daytime Emmy Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as the Top Female Artist of 2005 and the 11th most successful female artist of the 21st century. Clarkson&#x27;s first seven studio albums generated a total of 12 top-ten hits on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart between 2002 and 2024, as well as 10 top-ten singles in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Having a crossover appeal on various radio formats, she became the first act in history to top each of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop, adult contemporary, country, and dance airplay charts. VH1 ranked her nineteenth on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.

==Early life and career==
Kelly Brianne Clarkson was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first-grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. She has an older brother, Jason, and an older sister, Alyssa. Clarkson also has two younger half-brothers from her father&#x27;s second marriage. Her parents divorced when she was six years old, whereupon her brother went to live with their father, her sister went to live with an aunt, and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson&#x27;s mother later married Jimmy Taylor. Clarkson is of English, Welsh, Irish, and Greek descent. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose (Rose&#x27;s background was discussed on Clarkson&#x27;s episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2013). Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said, &quot;I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I&#x27;ve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I&#x27;ve just gotten a lot closer just because He&#x27;s the only one I can lean on.&quot; She later said of her upbringing, &quot;My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday.&quot;

Clarkson grew up in Burleson, Texas and was educated at Pauline Hughes Middle School. In the seventh grade, the school&#x27;s choir teacher, Cynthia Glenn, overheard her singing in a hallway and asked her to audition for the school choir. Clarkson told her she had never received any professional vocal training. Clarkson graduated from Burleson High School in 2000, where she performed in several musicals, such as &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. Clarkson started voice training, hoping to secure a college scholarship in music.

After graduating from high school, Clarkson declined full scholarships to the University of Texas at Austin, University of North Texas, and Berklee College of Music. She declined them saying, &quot;I&#x27;d already written so much music and wanted to try on my own... I figured you&#x27;re never too old to go to college.&quot; She worked several jobs to finance a demo, recording material and trying to market it to record labels, but she received little response. Clarkson turned down two recording contracts from Jive Records and Interscope Records, saying, &quot;They would have completely pigeonholed me as a bubblegum act. I was confident enough that something better would come along.&quot; In 2001, she traveled to Los Angeles, pursuing a career in music. She appeared as an extra in a few television series such as &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; and &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, and briefly worked with musician Gerry Goffin to record five demo tracks in an effort to secure a record deal. According to Clarkson, her early attempts to launch her music career floundered when she was turned down by almost every U.S. record label for sounding &quot;too black&quot;. Lack of other career opportunities and a fire incident in her apartment forced Clarkson to return to Burleson, where she promoted Red Bull energy drinks, worked as a telemarketer and as a cocktail waitress in a comedy club.

==Career==
===2002–2003: &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;World Idol&quot;, and &quot;Thankful&quot;===

Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series &quot;American Idol: The Search for a Superstar&quot; in May 2002. Despite receiving a &quot;golden ticket&quot;, a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred to the inaugural season as &quot;ghetto&quot;, explaining: &quot;On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever changing every day. They did one season of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; in the UK, but America is a very different market. They dropped us off in a mall and said &#x27;find some clothes to wear on national television&#x27;. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress.&quot; Clarkson went on to win the competition on September 4, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini.

Immediately after winning &quot;American Idol&quot;, Clarkson was signed to a record deal with RCA Records, 19 Recordings, and S Records by talent manager Simon Fuller, who created &quot;American Idol&quot;, and music mogul Clive Davis, who was slated to executive-produce her debut album. On September 17, 2002, her debut double-A-side single, &quot;Before Your Love&quot;/&quot;A Moment Like This&quot;, was released. Both songs were performed by Clarkson during the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;. After debuting at number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, the single climbed to number 52 the following week, and subsequently ascended to number one. It broke a 38-year-old record set by the British band The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one. It eventually went on to become the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States.

Clarkson&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Thankful&quot;, was released on April 15, 2003. The album contained aspects of pop, contemporary R&amp;B, and gospel music, with several established musicians such as Rhett Lawrence, Diane Warren, The Underdogs, and Babyface contributing on to the tracks. Released during a time of urban-R&amp;B dominance, the album was well received by several critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its vocal ability: &quot;throughout this record, (Clarkson) makes it seem effortless and charming. She can croon, she can belt out a song, she can be sexy and sassy while still being graceful and as wholesome as the girl next door.&quot; Henry Goldblatt of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked: &quot;Clarkson glides through octaves with the masterful control of someone who&#x27;s been doing this for decades.&quot; &quot;Thankful&quot; was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and went on to sell over 4.5 million copies worldwide. It was later certified double platinum by the RIAA, platinum in Canada, and gold in Japan and Australia. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Clarkson the 10th biggest female artist of 2003.

Its lead single, &quot;Miss Independent&quot;, became her first international hit, reaching the top ten in five national charts, including the US. It was later certified gold by the RIAA. It earned Clarkson her first Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&quot; at the 46th Grammy Awards. It was followed with two moderately successful singles, &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot;; the latter was used on the soundtrack of British romantic film &quot;Love Actually&quot;. Her first video album, &quot;Miss Independent&quot;, was released on November 18, 2003, and was certified gold by the RIAA. To support &quot;Thankful&quot;, Clarkson and &quot;Idol&quot; second season runner-up Clay Aiken co-headlined the 2004 Independent Tour throughout the US.

Clarkson made her film debut with Guarini with the release of the musical romantic comedy film &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; in June 2003. The film was poorly received by critics and was unsuccessful at the box office, with Clarkson explaining that she was &quot;contractually obligated&quot; to do the film and didn&#x27;t like it. In 2002, Clarkson, along with &quot;American Idol&quot; judges Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson and hosts Brian Dunkleman and Ryan Seacrest, participated in the season premiere of the eighth season of the television comedy series &quot;MADtv&quot;. She also portrayed Brenda Lee in two episodes of the television drama &quot;American Dreams&quot; between 2003 and 2004. On December 25, 2003, Clarkson participated in the television special competition &quot;World Idol&quot; in London, along with the inaugural winners of the several &quot;Idol&quot; television series around the world. Clarkson was contractually obligated to participate, and she performed Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;. She ended up as the runner-up with 97 points, behind the first &quot;Norwegian Idol&quot; Kurt Nilsen.

===2004–2006: New management and &quot;Breakaway&quot;===
Trying to distance herself from her &quot;American Idol&quot; image, Clarkson decided to leave Fuller and 19 Management and hired the services of talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm. She reinvented herself to some extent, developing a more rock-oriented sound with her second studio album, &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Davis served as the executive producer for the record, while Clarkson co-wrote six of the tracks with pop and rock songwriters such as former Evanescence band members Ben Moody and David Hodges, Kara DioGuardi, Dr. Luke and Max Martin. &quot;Breakaway&quot; received critical acclaim, with Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot; remarking: &quot;What gives &quot;Breakaway&quot; its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the tracks that illustrate Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who&#x27;s neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream.&quot;

&quot;Breakaway&quot; was released on November 30, 2004, and became Clarkson&#x27;s most commercially successful album. After debuting at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, its longevity allowed it to become the third-best-selling album of 2005 in the US and was certified sextuple platinum by the RIAA. The album also enjoyed success throughout the world; it topped the charts in the Netherlands and Ireland, became the world&#x27;s seventh-best-selling album of 2005 and went on to sell more than twelve million copies worldwide. Clarkson was named the Top Female Artist of the Year by &quot;Billboard&quot;. She promoted the album with the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and Addicted Tour which took place from 2005 to 2006.

Five singles were released to promote &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Its title track, &quot;Breakaway&quot;, was originally released in July 2004, as the soundtrack for Disney film &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; and was later re-released as the album&#x27;s fifth single in May 2006. It became Clarkson&#x27;s third top-ten single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with a peak of number six. It was a major success on adult contemporary radio, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary for 21 weeks and the Adult Contemporary Audience chart for 28 weeks (her longest number one on any charts). &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in November 2004 and became Clarkson&#x27;s most successful single on the Hot 100 despite peaking at number two. The second and third singles, &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot; and &quot;Because of You&quot;, also followed suit—peaking at number six and number seven on the Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Because of You&quot; became Clarkson&#x27;s biggest single worldwide, reaching number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart and the national charts in Brazil, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland. The fourth single, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, peaked at number twelve on the Hot 100. According to Mediabase, Clarkson was the most-played artist of 2006 in the U.S.

&quot;Breakaway&quot; garnered Clarkson many accolades, including two trophies at the 48th Grammy Awards—the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and the Best Pop Vocal Album. She also won Best Female Video two years in a row, for &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Because of You&quot;, at the MTV Video Music Awards. Clarkson&#x27;s second video album, &quot;Behind Hazel Eyes&quot;, was released on March 29, 2005.

She performed during the festivities All-Star Game and the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy; In 2006, Clarkson recorded &quot;Go&quot; as a free download for the Ford Motor Company advertising campaign.

===2007–2009: &quot;My December&quot; and &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot;===
Clarkson&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;My December&quot;, was released on June 22, 2007. The album relied on darker themes and heavier rock music. She replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks. She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators. Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis. He noted the album&#x27;s lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused. Clarkson defended herself saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what I have to say. I couldn&#x27;t give a crap about being a star. I&#x27;ve always just wanted to sing and write.&quot; The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore. Clarkson later hired talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend. Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as &quot;a key advisor&quot; in her success.
&quot;My December&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The album went on to sell over 2.5 million copies worldwide. It featured only one major hit single, &quot;Never Again&quot;, which debuted and peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—her highest debut on the chart ever. On July 7, 2007, Clarkson performed on the American leg of Live Earth concert. Clarkson partnered with NASCAR during their 2007 season, appearing in televised advertisements, performed at pre-race concerts, promoted NASCAR Day, and appeared at the Champions&#x27; Banquet in December.

Clarkson collaborated with Reba McEntire in an hour-long &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot; special at Nashville&#x27;s Ryman Auditorium on February 22, 2007. Introduced by Dolly Parton, Clarkson performed &quot;Why Haven&#x27;t I Heard from You&quot; and &quot;Does He Love You&quot; with Martina McBride on the television special &quot;CMT Giants: Reba McEntire&quot;. She also appeared on an episode of McEntire&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Reba&quot;, which aired on January 14, 2007. At the Academy of Country Music Awards on May 16, 2007, Clarkson and McEntire sang a country version of &quot;Because of You&quot;, which also became the lead single from the album &quot;&quot;. It peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Throughout 2008, Clarkson and McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour to support &quot;Reba: Duets&quot; and &quot;My December&quot;.
Clarkson&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot;, was released on March 10, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, but this time she returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remaining there for two weeks. The album has sold over a million copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.

Its first single, &quot;My Life Would Suck Without You&quot;, became an international hit. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 97 and rose to the top position the following week, breaking the record for the biggest jump to number one in a single week previously held by Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Womanizer&quot;. It also topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Hungary. It was followed with two more top-twenty singles, &quot;I Do Not Hook Up&quot; and &quot;Already Gone&quot;. The release of &quot;Already Gone&quot; became a subject of another dispute between Clarkson and RCA, after she realized its similarities with Beyoncé&#x27;s song &quot;Halo&quot;, both of which were produced by Tedder. Further promotion for the album was abruptly ended with the limited success of its fourth and final singles, &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot;. Clarkson supported &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; with the All I Ever Wanted Tour from 2009 to 2010. She also performed as one of many main artists for the return of &quot;VH1 Divas&quot; in September 2009. Clarkson became a guest mentor on the Dutch television series &quot;X Factor&quot; in November 2009.

Clarkson recorded a country duet with Jason Aldean, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wanna Stay&quot;, for his 2010 album &quot;My Kinda Party&quot;. It became her first number-one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart and has sold over 2.7 million copies, making it the best-selling country collaboration in history. It received numerous country-related accolades, including a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards. Clarkson incorporated a slight country vibe into her fifth studio album, &quot;Stronger&quot;, which was also influenced by Prince, Tina Turner, Sheryl Crow, and Radiohead. She worked with several producers including Greg Kurstin, Ester Dean, Darkchild, Toby Gad, Steve Jordan, and Howard Benson. Released on October 21, 2011, &quot;Stronger&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. It was also critically applauded and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards, making her the first artist to win the award twice.
&quot;Stronger&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Mr. Know It All&quot;, was released in September 2011. It reached number one in Australia and South Korea and attained a top-ten position in seven countries, including the U.S., where it became her ninth top-ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It also became a crossover hit to the country charts, prompting RCA to reissue a country version. &quot;Stronger (What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You)&quot; served as the second single in January 2012, and topped sixteen &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, becoming her third number one on the Hot 100. It also reached number one in Poland and Slovakia and reached the top ten in many other charts worldwide. It remains Clarkson&#x27;s best-selling single, with 4.9 million copies sold in the U.S. alone. The song was nominated for three Grammy Awards—Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance. &quot;Dark Side&quot; was released as the third and final single in June 2012, and it achieved a modest success. It became her eleventh top-ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Pop Songs chart, and she surpassed Sheryl Crow and Katy Perry as the female artist with the most top-ten songs on the chart.

The release of &quot;Stronger&quot; was accompanied by two EPs, &quot;The Smoakstack Sessions&quot; and &quot;iTunes Session&quot;. The latter debuted at number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it was promoted by its only single, a cover of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;. Clarkson co-wrote &quot;Tell Me a Lie&quot;, which was recorded by British boy band One Direction for their debut album, &quot;Up All Night&quot; (2011). Clarkson promoted &quot;Stronger&quot; with two concert tours, the Stronger Tour and the co-headlining the Kelly Clarkson / The Fray Tour with the alternative rock band The Fray. On February 5, 2012, she performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Super Bowl XLVI to widespread critical acclaim. She later released a promotional single, &quot;Get Up (A Cowboys Anthem)&quot;, for use in Pepsi&#x27;s NFL advertising campaign.

Clarkson served as a mentor and judge, alongside John Legend, Jennifer Nettles, and Robin Thicke, on the ABC television show &quot;Duets,&quot; which premiered on May 24, 2012. The show concluded on July 19, 2012, with Clarkson&#x27;s contestant Jason Farol finishing as the second runner-up. She also became a guest mentor to Blake Shelton&#x27;s team on second season on &quot;The Voice&quot;. The two later collaborated on a cover of &quot;There&#x27;s a New Kid in Town&quot; for Shelton&#x27;s 2012 Christmas album, &quot;Cheers, It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;.

Commemorating the 10th anniversary of her career in music, Clarkson released her first greatest hits album, &quot;Greatest Hits – Chapter One&quot;, on November 19, 2012. Three new songs recorded for the compilation—&quot;Catch My Breath&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Rush&quot; (featuring country musician Vince Gill) and &quot;People Like Us&quot;—were all released as singles. &quot;Catch My Breath&quot; became her 14th top-twenty hit on the Hot 100 chart as well as her 13th million-selling single in the United States. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it was the third biggest adult contemporary song of 2013. However, its follow-up singles performed moderately well on the charts. Clarkson earned more nominations from the country music industry, including Best Country Duo/Group Performance for &quot;Don&#x27;t Rush&quot; at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards and Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2012 Country Music Association Awards. &quot;Chapter One&quot; was eventually certified gold in Australia, the UK and the U.S.

In January 2013, Clarkson performed &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; at the second inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama. Her live rendition was acclaimed by critics, who contrasted it with Beyoncé&#x27;s pre-recorded performance during the same event. In February 2013, she performed &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards as a tribute to Patti Page and Carole King.

She was featured on the re-recorded version of &quot;Foolish Games&quot; for Jewel&#x27;s first compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2013). Clarkson also collaborated with singer Robbie Williams on the song &quot;Little Green Apples&quot; for his 2013 album &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot;.

Clarkson&#x27;s sixth studio album and first Christmas record, &quot;Wrapped in Red&quot;, was solely produced by Greg Kurstin. She co-wrote all five original songs and recorded eleven cover versions of Christmas standards and carols. Released on October 25, 2013, the album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Holiday Albums and at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. By December 2013, &quot;Wrapped in Red&quot; had already been certified platinum by the RIAA and eventually became the best-selling holiday album of the year. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Underneath the Tree&quot;, was an adult contemporary number-one hit in both the U.S. and Canada. Clarkson subsequently became &quot;Billboard&quot;″s ninth top adult contemporary act of 2013. On December 11, 2013, her first Christmas special debut, &quot;Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s Cautionary Christmas Music Tale,&quot; garnered over 5.3 million viewers. In December 2013, Citizen Watch Co. announced Clarkson as their newest Brand Ambassador. Retaining her relationship with country music acts in 2014, Clarkson collaborated with Martina McBride on &quot;In the Basement&quot; (originally by Etta James and Sugar Pie DeSanto) for McBride&#x27;s album &quot;Everlasting&quot; and with Trisha Yearwood on &quot;PrizeFighter&quot; for Yearwood&#x27;s compilation &quot;&quot;. Clarkson also performed a rendition of &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; with Josh Groban on his seventh studio album, &quot;Stages&quot;, and its companion television special.

Musically, it is an electropop and dance album, featuring collaborations with Kurstin, Jesse Shatkin, Sia, John Legend, and Shane McAnally, among others. &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; received a reasonably positive response from music critics and became her third album to debut at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. To promote the album, Clarkson appeared in several televised performances, including the fourteenth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, where she became the only alumnus ever to be dedicated with a competing week featuring her discography. She also supported the Piece by Piece Tour throughout 2015, which was cut short of its worldwide visits following medical recommendations for a vocal rest during the year.

&quot;Piece by Piece&quot; spawned three singles. The first one, &quot;Heartbeat Song&quot;, peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and became a top-ten hit in the UK, Austria, Poland, and South Africa. However, Clarkson failed to achieve a similar success with the second single, &quot;Invincible&quot;. The third and final single, &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, debuted and peaked at number eight on the Hot 100 chart, following Clarkson&#x27;s emotional performance on the fifteenth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. It became her eleventh U.S. top-ten hit and matched &quot;Never Again&quot; as her highest debut on the chart. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and &quot;Heartbeat Song&quot; were nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance, respectively. At the following year, the title track also received a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.

On the possibility of writing any more books in the future, Clarkson told &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a few ideas – there could be a lullaby for each book. We&#x27;ve got a plethora of stories, and I&#x27;ve already written seven songs, full out, so we&#x27;ll just have to see which ones might pan out to be a book. But yes, there will definitely be more.&quot; The second book featuring River Rose, &quot;River Rose and the Magical Christmas,&quot; was released on October 24, 2017, and included an original song written and sung by Clarkson, &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Voice===
Critics have said Clarkson has a soprano voice. Arion Berger of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;her high notes are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her mid-range is amazingly confident.&quot; In reviewing a live performance of Clarkson&#x27;s, Jon Caramanica of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said she &quot;showed off a voice that moved in all sorts of ways, without ever appearing to strain&quot;, continuing &quot;Ms. Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making&quot;. However, in a separate review of &quot;Stronger&quot;, Caramanica said Clarkson&#x27;s voice is &quot;too huge, too violent&quot; for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating &quot;she&#x27;s on a par with Taylor Swift when it comes to vengeance, and she&#x27;ll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary.&quot; In a live review as part of her Stronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair of &quot;Hit The Floor&quot; said &quot;Kelly&#x27;s strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night, and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums&quot;. Mark Deming from &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; stated that &quot;in an era when pop music means over-singing a song into a bloody pulp, Clarkson has consistently displayed both charisma and a welcome sense of restraint, knowing how to sound passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go.&quot;

Dr. Luke, who produced some of Clarkson&#x27;s hits, said &quot;She has powerful lungs. She&#x27;s like the Lance Armstrong of vocal cords.&quot;
In an interview with &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Simon Cowell was asked of the then six &quot;American Idol&quot; winners, who he thought had the best voice. Cowell immediately answered that Clarkson did &quot;by a mile&quot;, noting that she was &quot;up there&quot; with other great singers such as Celine Dion. &quot;Esquire&quot; wrote that Clarkson has &quot;the best voice in the history of pop music&quot;. Reviewing &quot;Stronger&quot;, Jody Rosen of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; states, Clarkson has &quot;one of music&#x27;s most remarkable voices.&quot; Jason Lipshutz from &quot;Billboard&quot; considered Clarkson as one of the greatest singers in pop music. Regarding the controversial practice of lip-syncing, Clarkson says she never has and never will lip-sync, elaborating in an interview with Cory Myers, &quot;I&#x27;ve actually never done that because I&#x27;m terrified; if I ever did that, something horrible would happen, the track would skip. I have a really unhealthy fear about it. So no, I&#x27;ve never done that&quot;. Clarkson has earned the title &quot;Queen of Covers&quot; for her ability to perform songs from artists of various genres.

===Influences===

At age eight, Clarkson was first inspired to venture into music during a visit to an African-American church in Fort Worth, Texas. She recalled: &quot;I was like, &#x27;Wow, whatever they&#x27;re feeling, I want to feel it too&#x27;.&quot; Clarkson has been influenced by musicians across various genres. She cited soul singer Aretha Franklin as her major influence. Many of her chosen &quot;Idol&quot; numbers were Aretha Franklin covers, including &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;, which is considered her breakout moment during the competition. Other soul acts who influenced Clarkson were Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Etta James and Stevie Wonder. Clarkson was also influenced by Christina Aguilera, by rock acts such as Radiohead, Garbage, Aerosmith, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, and Rosemary Clooney. Regarding her musical influence, Clarkson explained:

I grew up with three totally different parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis and all that kind of stuff. And my real father is into Whitney and Mariah, and Aretha, all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra [Streisand], Bette Midler, all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He&#x27;s like ten years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N&#x27; Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.
Clarkson often covers rock songs on her Kellyoke segment of her talk show, such as Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Sad but True&quot;, and Heart&#x27;s &quot;Crazy on You&quot;.

==Impact==


Clarkson has scored over 100 number ones on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide, including 14 million albums and 35 million digital singles in the United States alone. She became the first artist to top each of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop, adult contemporary, country and dance charts. She was ranked nineteenth on VH1&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. Television channel Fuse included Clarkson among &quot;30 Greatest Musicians to Come From Singing Competitions&quot; list. In 2025, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed Clarkson as the 11th biggest female artist of the 21st century (27th overall).

Music executive Simon Cowell believed that &quot;What [Clarkson] sold in the UK, Europe, Asia had nothing to do with &quot;American Idol&quot;. It had everything to do with the fact that she made a great record and she&#x27;s got an incredible voice. She&#x27;s not a girl who got lucky in a talent competition; we got lucky to find her.&quot; According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Clarkson is &quot;the embodiment of the perfect pop star. Her unmistakable pipes are a powerful presence in top 40 and country, with forays into anthemic rock and dance.&quot; Nolan Feeney from &quot;Time&quot; asserted that Clarkson &quot;has had more of a lasting impact on the pop music landscape than casual listeners might realize.&quot;

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, Clarkson was a &quot;phenomenon&quot; who &quot;helped legitimize&quot; the impact of talent shows. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s powerhouse voice and dynamic presence signaled that the music industry should take these reality show contestants seriously: Her first two albums, &quot;Thankful&quot; and &quot;Breakaway&quot;, sold about ten million copies combined, and her pop tunes became empowerment anthems across the globe.&quot; In 2007, journalist Nekesa Mumbi Moody reported that the success of &quot;Breakaway&quot; in particular was the true pivotal moment in establishing &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s credibility, proving that the show was capable of &quot;finding someone who would have a career with longevity&quot;. Glenn Gamboa of &quot;Newsday&quot; believed Clarkson &quot;has set the standard for all singing competition contestants with her savvy mix of pop, rock and country.&quot;
Fox Broadcasting Company said that Clarkson gave &quot;lasting credibility&quot; to &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;in so many ways she cleared a road&quot; for all of the next contestants.&quot; George Varga from &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; underlined the difference of Clarkson from most other talent show contestants is that she &quot;writes or co-writes a fair number of [her] own songs. She is also the only one whose quest to follow her artistic instincts—the better to rock out and break free from the &quot;Idol&quot; cookie-cutter pop mold—prompted her to fire her management team and engage in a prolonged public battle with her record company, RCA.&quot;

Jon Lisi from &quot;PopMatters&quot; cited Clarkson as one of the forces of female domination in pop music of the 2000s. He explained that &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s anti-sexual image appealed to those who were uncomfortable with Britney Spears&#x27; overt exhibitionism. When Clarkson performed &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, for instance, she only showed her midriff, and it was clear that she was marketing herself to an alternative group of young females who liked pop music&#x27;s conventional sound but didn&#x27;t want to be confronted with sexual imagery.&quot; Mickey Rapkin of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, who called Clarkson a role model and compared her vocals to golden-era Aretha Franklin, stated that Clarkson &quot;has never shied away from speaking her mind, whether in her propulsive pop anthems or on her filter-free Twitter feed.&quot; Clarkson has been an influence on other artists, including Vanessa Hudgens, Demi Lovato, Ava Max, Jordin Sparks, Ashley Tisdale, Avril Lavigne,
as well as country music singers such as Kelsea Ballerini and Priscilla Block.

==Personal life==
In February 2012, Clarkson began dating talent manager Brandon Blackstock, son of her former manager Narvel Blackstock and former stepson of Reba McEntire. She and Blackstock married on October 20, 2013, at Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tennessee. During their marriage, Brandon was her manager. Together, they have a daughter, born in June 2014, and a son, born in April 2016. In June 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce from Blackstock, citing irreconcilable differences. In March 2022, it was reported their divorce had been finalized. On November 21, 2023, Clarkson was awarded more than $2.6 million from her ex-husband for commissions paid to him for business deals he procured as her manager. The California Labor Commissioner ruled that Blackstock violated the state&#x27;s Talent Agencies Act by handling these deals, which should have been managed by Clarkson&#x27;s talent agents at Creative Artists Agency. The ruling included commissions from Clarkson&#x27;s role on &quot;The Voice&quot; and other promotional agreements, but did not require repayment for deals related to &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot;.

In October 2019, Clarkson said that she has been managing an autoimmune condition and a thyroid condition since 2006, which she had previously addressed on &quot;Today&quot; in 2018.

In February 2022, Clarkson changed her legal name to Kelly Brianne. In an interview, she revealed the name change was for her personal life, while her public name would remain the same. Clarkson stated the reason behind her name change was due to a strained relationship with her late father.

==Philanthropy==

In April 2007, Clarkson took part in &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot;, a fundraiser for people in poverty in both Africa and the U.S., performing &quot;Up to the Mountain&quot; along with Jeff Beck. She would also perform a five-song set later that year on the American leg of Live Earth concerts opting for environmental awareness about climate change. She has served as ambassador for the March of Dimes since she was on &quot;American Idol&quot;, raising money regularly and assisting in volunteer service, having walked for &quot;March for Babies&quot;, for the cause of improvement of the health of mothers and babies. Clarkson, additionally, got involved in the organization &quot;Houses of Hope&quot;, who take care and build orphanages for children in South Africa who have been affected by HIV/AIDS, abuse and poverty. She has visited those children and also participated in &quot;A Night for Hope&quot; fund-raiser concert (held by Clarkson&#x27;s background vocal singers, Jill and Kate), where she performed a song she wrote after her trip to South Africa, &quot;You Still Won&#x27;t Know What It&#x27;s Like&quot;. Clarkson also supports the charities Save the Children, UNICEF, &quot;Do Something&quot; and &quot;STOMP Out Bullying&quot; and music causes like the Save the Music Foundation.

Clarkson had a ranch in Texas for unwanted animals, which included amputee goats, blind dogs, and horses that survived colic; there are more than 80 animals at the sanctuary. She helped provide veterinary care for them and found them an adoptive family. Clarkson performed in a benefit concert on March 1, 2013, supporting the Omaha based Opportunity Education Foundation, an organization that provides access to education for children around the world, stating &quot;Education was a key part of my childhood, and I am better for it. Anything for education I am really into and especially for kids. A lot of people don&#x27;t have computers, and they can&#x27;t afford them. Without education, you get far behind. As long as they have a chance, you know, I think that&#x27;s important. I want every kid to have a chance.&quot; In 2013, Clarkson teamed up with State Farm Insurance to support teen safe driving as a part of Celebrate My Drive program. In 2013, Clarkson supported Feeding America, The Ad Council and their Child Hunger PSA Campaign, which provides food for children facing hunger. Also in 2013, Clarkson participated in Green Mountain Coffee&#x27;s Great Coffee, Good Vibes, Choose Fair Trade campaign by traveling to coffee farms in Peru to draw attention to the importance of being Fair Trade Certified.

<text>The Tory Reform Group (TRG) is a pressure group associated with the British Conservative Party that works to promote &quot;modern, progressive Conservatism [...] economic efficiency and social justice&quot; and &quot;a Conservatism that supports equality, diversity and civil liberties&quot;, values sometimes associated with Harold Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Middle Way&quot; or what the group consider a moderate one-nation conservatism. Senior figures include Michael Heseltine, Douglas Hurd, Kenneth Clarke, and Chris Patten.

The TRG supported David Cameron, who described TRG as &quot;central to where we need to be in the future&quot;. The group has an events programme and publications, principally its journal. Members include parliamentarians, councillors, association officers and private individuals.

==History==

The oldest known branch, which pre-dated the National TRG, was founded in the University of Oxford in 1962, when they split from the Oxford University Conservative Association. This branch disbanded in 2007.

The Tory Reform Group (TRG) was formally established in June 1975 from the merger of four groups: PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism), two separate London dining clubs called the Macleod Group and Social Tory Action Group, and a consortium in the North West also known as the McLeod Group led by two Young Conservative activists and parliamentary candidates Steve Perry and Stuart Lindsay who had already changed the name to the TRG.

The key figure in the formation of TRG was Peter Walker MP, a former Minister in Heath&#x27;s Government from 1970 to 1974. Once out of government, he was urged by MPs to form a parliamentary group that represented the liberal Conservative view of the Tory Party.

Walker was reluctant to form such a group at first, not least because he was sensitive to the damaging effects the Tribune Group had wrought on Labour and did not like the idea of similarly factionalising the Conservative Party. As time passed, however, other groups emerged, including right-wing Conservative groups, and the perceived need for a counteracting group increased. At his home in Westminster, Walker met with chairmen of four organisations he had previously had contact with, and they agreed to come together to form the TRG. From the start, the TRG was an activist group with membership, as opposed to being a think tank. The TRG hoped to spread its view through publication of pamphlets, discussion with MPs, use of media, and by widening its membership. Weekly lunches were inherited from PEST. London PEST had organised a Tuesday Luncheon Club in local pubs, such as Magpie and Stump in Old Bailey. These lunches provided a programme of speakers as well as opportunities for members to become involved in constituency activities.

In January 1976, TRG released its first publication, entitled Home Run by Nicholas Scott MP, the President of TRG, arguing for a nationwide extension of the GLC&#x27;s sale of council houses to their tenants a key part of the Conservative policy platform.

The 1980s saw TRG pitched headlong into some passionate debates within the Conservative Party, including over the direction of economic policy and the apartheid regime in South Africa.

==Ideology==
The TRG sees itself following the philosophies of Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;One Nation&quot; and Harold Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Middle Way&quot;. With an interventionist attitude, the TRG was set in the image of historical figures such as Iain Macleod and R.A. Butler.

=== Europe ===
Most of the major pro-EU Conservative politicians of the last thirty years have at one time or another been associated with the Tory Reform Group, including TRG president Ken Clarke, patrons including John Major, and other senior TRG figures such as Damian Green. The TRG was a constituent organisation of Conservative Mainstream alongside the Conservative Europe Group and Parliamentary Mainstream, and at one time were all run from shared offices in Westminster. TRG members formed the core of the short lived Pro-Euro Conservative Party, which disbanded in favour of the Liberal Democrats within three years of being formed. The TRG is commonly seen as supporting the European Union. However, it has no official position on UK membership of the EU and includes many Eurosceptics among its members and supporters.

<doc id="414852" wikidata="Q371558" url="?curid=414852" title="Institutes of the Christian Religion">
<text>Institutes of the Christian Religion () is John Calvin&#x27;s seminal work of systematic theology. Regarded as one of the most influential works of Protestant theology, it was published in Latin in 1536 at the same time as Henry VIII of England&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries and in his native French language in 1541. The definitive editions appeared in 1559 in Latin and in 1560 in French.

The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant creed for those with some previous knowledge of theology and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone and Christian liberty. It vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered unorthodox, particularly Roman Catholicism, to which Calvin says he had been &quot;strongly devoted&quot; before his conversion to Protestantism.

The &quot;Institutes&quot; is a core reference for the system of doctrine adopted by the Reformed churches, usually called Calvinism.

==Background==

John Calvin was a student of law and then classics at the University of Paris. Around 1533 he became involved in religious controversies and converted to Protestantism, a new Christian reform movement which was persecuted by the Catholic Church in France, forcing him to go into hiding. He moved to Basel, Switzerland for safety in 1535, and around this time he must have begun writing a summary of theology which would become the &quot;Institutes&quot;. His Catholic opponents sought to tie him and his associates (known as Huguenots in France) to groups of radical Anabaptists, some of which had been put down by persecution. He decided to adapt the work he had been writing to the purpose of defending Protestants suffering from persecution from false accusations that they were espousing radical and heretical doctrines. The work, written in Latin, was published in Basel in March 1536 with a preface addressed to King Francis I of France, entreating him to give the Protestants a hearing rather than continue to persecute them. It is six chapters long, covering the basics of Christian creed using the familiar catechetical structure of the Ten Commandments, the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and the sacraments, as well as a chapter on Christian liberty and political theology. Soon after publishing it, Calvin began his ministry in Geneva, Switzerland.

The &quot;Institutes&quot; proved instantly popular, with many asking for a revised edition. In 1539, Calvin published a much larger work, with seventeen chapters of about the same length as the six chapters of the first edition. It includes many references to classical authors and Church fathers, as well as many additional references to the Bible. Calvin&#x27;s epistle to the reader indicates that the new work is intended for theological students preparing for ministry. Four chapters were added in a third edition in 1543, and a 1550 edition was published with only minor changes. The fifth and final edition with which Calvin was involved, and which is used by scholars as the authoritative text, is 80% larger than the previous edition and was published in Geneva in 1559.

Calvin&#x27;s theology did not change substantially throughout his life, and so while he expanded and added to the &quot;Institutes&quot;, he did not change their main ideas.

==Title==
The Latin word &quot;&quot;, translated in the title as &quot;institutes&quot;, may also be translated &quot;instruction&quot;, as it was in titles of German translations of the work, and was commonly used in the titles of legal works as well as other summary works covering a large body of knowledge. The title of Desiderius Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Institutio principis Christiani&quot; (1516), with which Calvin would have been familiar, is usually translated &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince&quot;. The form of the short title of the first edition of Calvin&#x27;s work, published in 1536 is &quot;Christianae religionis institutio&quot;. The full title of this edition may be translated &quot;The Institute of the Christian Religion, Containing almost the Whole Sum of Piety and Whatever It is Necessary to Know in the Doctrine of Salvation. A Work Very Well Worth Reading by All Persons Zealous for Piety, and Lately Published. A Preface to the Most Christian King of France, in Which this Book is Presented to Him as a Confession of Faith. Author, John Calvin, Of Noyon. Basel, MDXXXVI.&quot; In the 1539 edition, the title is &quot;Institutio Christianae Religionis&quot;, possibly to emphasize the fact that this is a new, considerably expanded work. This is followed by &quot;at length truly corresponding to its title&quot;, a play on the grandiosity of the title and an indication that the new work better lives up to the expectation created by such a title.

==Contents==

&quot;Institutes&quot; in its first form was not merely an exposition of Reformation doctrine; it proved the inspiration to a new form of Christian life for many. It is indebted to Martin Luther in the treatment of faith and sacraments, to Martin Bucer in what is said of divine will and predestination, and to the later scholastics for teaching involving unsuspected implications of freedom in the relation of church and state.

The book is prefaced by a letter to Francis I. As this letter shows, &quot;Institutes&quot; was composed, or at least completed, to meet a present necessity, to correct an aspersion on Calvin&#x27;s fellow reformers. The French king, wishing to suppress the Reformation at home, yet unwilling to alienate the reforming princes of Germany, had sought to confound the teachings of the French reformers with the attacks of Anabaptists on civil authority. &quot;My reasons for publishing the Institutes,&quot; Calvin wrote in 1557, &quot;were first that I might vindicate from unjust affront my brethren whose death was precious in the sight of the Lord, and next that some sorrow and anxiety should move foreign people, since the same sufferings threaten many.&quot; &quot;The hinges on which our controversy turns,&quot; says Calvin in his letter to the king, &quot;are that the Church may exist without any apparent form&quot; and that its marks are &quot;pure preaching of the word of God and rightful administration of the sacraments.&quot;

Despite the dependence on earlier writers, &quot;Institutes&quot; was felt by many to be a new voice, and within a year there was demand for a second edition. This came in 1539, amplifying especially the treatment of the fall of man, of election, and of reprobation, as well as that of the authority of scripture. It showed also a more conciliatory temper toward Luther in the section on the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

 The opening chapter of the &quot;Institutes&quot; is perhaps the best known, in which Calvin presents the basic plan of the book. There are two general subjects to be examined: the creator and his creatures. Above all, the book concerns the knowledge of God the Creator, but &quot;as it is in the creation of man that the divine perfections are best displayed&quot;, there is also an examination of what can be known about mankind. After all, it is mankind&#x27;s knowledge of God and of what He requires of his creatures that is the primary issue of concern for a book of theology. In the first chapter, these two issues are considered together to show what God has to do with mankind (and other creatures) and, especially, how knowing God is connected with human knowledge.

To pursue an explanation of the relationship between God and man, the edition of 1559, although Calvin claimed it to be &quot;almost a new work&quot;, in fact completely recast the old &quot;Institutes&quot; into four sections and 80 chapters, on the basis of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, a traditional structure of Christian instruction used in Western Christianity. First, the knowledge of God is considered as knowledge of the Father, the creator, provider, and sustainer. Next, it is examined how the Son reveals the Father, since only God is able to reveal God. The third section of the &quot;Institutes&quot; describes the work of the Holy Spirit, who raised Christ from the dead, and who comes from the Father and the Son to affect a union in the Church through faith in Jesus Christ, with God, forever. And finally, the fourth section speaks of the Christian church, and how it is to live out the truths of God and Scriptures, particularly through the sacraments. This section also describes the functions and ministries of the church, how civil government relates to religious matters, and includes a lengthy discussion of the deficiencies of the papacy.

==Translations==

There is some speculation that Calvin may have translated the first edition (1536) into French soon after its publication, but the earliest edition which has survived is Calvin&#x27;s 1541 translation. It was primarily intended for French-speaking Swiss, since very few copies were able to be smuggled into France. Some of these were publicly burned in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral soon after their publication. Calvin published French editions of the &quot;Institutes&quot; in 1541, 1545, 1551, and 1560. They follow the expansion and development of the Latin editions, but they are not strictly translations, instead being adapted for use by a lay readership, though retaining the same doctrine.

The French translations of Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; helped to shape the French language for generations, not unlike the influence of the King James Version for the English language. There are differences in translations of one of the more famous passages. First, from Calvin&#x27;s 1560 French edition, &quot;Institution&quot;, III, 7:

The &quot;Institutes&quot; were translated into many other European languages. A Spanish translation by Francisco de Enzinas of the 1536 Latin text was published in 1540, before Calvin even published his first French edition. An Italian translation of Calvin&#x27;s French text was made in 1557. Later translations were of the final 1559 Latin text: Dutch (1560), German (1572), Spanish (1597), Czech (1617), Hungarian (1624), and Japanese (1934). Scholars speculate that the seventeenth-century orientalist Johann Heinrich Hottinger translated it into Arabic, but this has not been confirmed. A complete translation by H. W. Simpson of the 1559 Latin text into Afrikaans was published in four volumes between 1984 and 1992, following an earlier abridged translation by A. Duvenhage in 1951.

In English, five complete translations have been published – four from the Latin and one from the French. The first was made in Calvin&#x27;s lifetime (1561) by Thomas Norton, the son-in-law of the English Reformer Thomas Cranmer. The Norton translation of the passage above, &quot;Institutes&quot;, III, 7:

We are not our owne: therefore let neither our owne reason nor our owne will beare rule in our counselles and doinges. We are not our owne: therefore let us not make this the ende for us to tend unto, to seke that which may be expediét for us according to the flesh. We are not our owne: therefore so much as we may, let us foreget our selves and all things that our our owne. On the other side, we are God&#x27;s: therefore let us live and dye to him.

In the nineteenth century there were two translations, one by John Allen (1813). The same passage in the Allen translation, &quot;Institutes&quot;, III, 7:

We are not our own; therefore neither our reason nor our will should predominate in our deliberations and actions. We are not our own; therefore let us not propose it as our end, to seek what may be expedient for us according to the flesh. We are not our own; therefore, let us, as far as possible, forget ourselves and all things that are ours. On the contrary, we are God&#x27;s; to him, therefore, let us live and die. 

Also from the nineteenth century, the Henry Beveridge (1845) translation, &quot;Institutes&quot;, III, 7:

We are not our own; therefore, neither is our own reason or will to rule our acts and counsels. We are not our own; therefore, let us not make it our end to seek what may be agreeable to our carnal nature. We are not our own; therefore, as far as possible, let us forget ourselves and the things that are ours. On the other hand, we are God&#x27;s; let us, therefore, live and die to him.

The most recent from Latin is the 1960 edition, translated by Ford Lewis Battles and edited by John T. McNeill, currently considered the most authoritative edition by scholars. The Battles translation of the same passage, &quot;Institutes&quot;, III, 7:

Calvin&#x27;s first French edition (1541) has been translated by Elsie Anne McKee (2009) and by Robert White (2014). Due to the length of the &quot;Institutes&quot;, several abridged versions have been made. The most recent is by Tony Lane and Hilary Osborne; the text is their own alteration and abridgment of the Beveridge translation.

==Legacy==

The &quot;Institutes&quot; overshadowed the earlier Protestant theologies such as Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Loci Communes&quot; and Zwingli&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the True and False Religion.&quot; According to historian Philip Schaff, it is a classic of theology at the level of Origen&#x27;s &quot;On First Principles&quot;, Augustine&#x27;s &quot;The City of God&quot;, Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, and Schleiermacher&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Faith&quot;. (Schaff himself was an adherent of Reformed Christianity, which traces its roots to John Calvin.)

<doc id="414855" wikidata="Q177823" url="?curid=414855" title="Halal">
<text>Halal (; ) is an Arabic word that translates to in English. In the Quran, the term &quot;halal&quot; is contrasted with the term &quot;haram&quot; (). It is used to refer to actions, behaviors, or items that are acceptable under the teachings of Islam. &quot;Halal&quot; applies not only to food but also to various aspects of life, including finance, clothing, and behavior. The concept of &quot;halal&quot; is central to Islamic practices and is derived from the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad). The guidelines for what is considered &quot;halal&quot; or &quot;haram&quot; are laid out in Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;), and scholars interpret these guidelines to ensure compliance with Islamic principles.

In the modern world, the concept of halal has expanded beyond individual actions and dietary restrictions to become a global industry, particularly in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and financial sectors. Halal certification bodies ensure that products and services meet the required standards for consumption by Muslims, and many companies worldwide seek halal certification to cater to the growing demand for halal products, especially with the rise in the global Muslim population.
Although halal is often associated with dietary laws, particularly meat that is slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines, it also governs ethical practices in business, finance (such as the prohibition of interest or &quot;riba&quot;), and daily living. It encompasses broader ethical considerations, including fairness, social justice, and the treatment of animals.
The increasing demand for halal products and services has led to the growth of the halal economy, especially in countries with significant Muslim populations, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Middle East. Many non-Muslim-majority countries also engage in the halal market to meet the needs of their Muslim citizens and global consumers.
This binary opposition was elaborated into a more complex classification known as &quot;the five decisions&quot;: mandatory, recommended, neutral, reprehensible and forbidden. Islamic jurists disagree on whether the term &quot;halal&quot; covers the first two or the first four of these categories. In recent times, Islamic movements seeking to mobilize the masses and authors writing for a popular audience have emphasized the simpler distinction of halal and haram. The term &quot;halal&quot; is particularly associated with Islamic dietary laws and especially meat processed and prepared in accordance with those requirements.

== In the Quran ==
The words &quot;halal&quot; and &quot;haram&quot; are the common terms used in the Quran to designate the categories of lawful or allowed and unlawful or forbidden. In the Quran, the root &quot;ḥ-l-l&quot; denotes lawfulness and may also indicate exiting the ritual state of a pilgrim and entering a profane state. In both these senses, it has an opposite meaning to that conveyed by the root &quot;ḥ-r-m&quot; (cf. &quot;haram&quot; and ). In a literal sense, the root ḥr-m may refer to dissolution (e.g., breaking of an oath) or alighting (e.g., of God&#x27;s wrath). Lawfulness is usually indicated in the Quran by means of the verb (), with God as the stated or implied subject.

== Foods ==

Islam generally considers every food halal unless it is specifically prohibited in hadith or the Qur&#x27;an. Specifically, halal foods are those that are:

# Made, produced, manufactured, processed, and stored using machinery, equipment, and/or utensils that have been cleaned according to Islamic law (shariah).
# Free from any component that Muslims are prohibited from eating according to Islamic law.

The most common example of haram (non-halal) food is pork. While pork is the only meat that categorically may not be consumed by Muslims (the Quran forbids it, Surah 2:173 and 16:115) other foods not in a state of purity are also considered haram. The criteria for non-pork items include their source, the cause of the animal&#x27;s death and how it was processed. The majority of Islamic scholars consider shellfish and other seafood halal. Vegetarian cuisine is halal if it does not contain alcohol.

Muslims must also ensure that all foods (particularly processed foods), as well as non-food items like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, are halal. Frequently, these products contain animal by-products or other ingredients that are not permissible for Muslims to eat or use on their bodies. Foods which are not considered halal for Muslims to consume include blood and intoxicants such as alcoholic beverages.

A Muslim who would otherwise starve to death is allowed to eat non-halal food if there is no halal food available. 

Several food companies offer halal processed foods and products, including halal foie gras, spring rolls, chicken nuggets, ravioli, lasagna, pizza and baby food. Halal ready meals are a growing consumer market for Muslims in Britain and America and are offered by an increasing number of retailers.

Opinions on GMO foods are mixed, although there is no widely accepted prohibition from consuming them. Some clerics and scholars have expressed support, arguing that such food production methods are halal because they contribute to human well-being. Voices in opposition to GMOs argue that there is no need for genetic modification of food crops because God created everything perfectly and man does not have any right to manipulate anything that God has created. Some others have raised concern about the theoretical consumption of specific GMO foods produced using genes from pigs.

===Halal meat===
Muslims believe in what they see as the ethical treatment of animals. Halal practices align with this philosophy by promoting kindness, compassion, and humane treatment throughout the entire lifecycle of the animal. The emphasis on swift and painless slaughter respects the animal&#x27;s dignity and minimizes suffering.

Halal meat must come from a supplier that uses halal practices. () is the prescribed method of slaughter for all meat sources, excluding fish and other sealife, per Islamic law. This method of slaughtering animals consists of using a sharp knife to make an incision that cuts the front of the throat, oesophagus and jugular veins but not the spinal cord. The head of an animal that is slaughtered using halal methods should be aligned with the (the direction a Muslim faces when praying). In addition to the direction, permitted animals should be slaughtered upon utterance of the Islamic prayer &quot;Bismillah, Allahu Akbar&quot; (In the name of God, God is greatest).

The slaughter must be performed by a Muslim. Carrion (carcasses of dead animals, such as animals who died in the wild) cannot be eaten. Additionally, an animal that has been strangled, beaten (to death), killed by a fall, gored (to death), savaged by a beast of prey (unless finished off by a human), or sacrificed on a stone altar cannot be eaten.

====Compatibility with other religions====

Animals slaughtered by People of the Book (Jews and Christians) can also be considered halal if the slaughter is carried out by jugular slice, the blood drained and the name of Allah invoked. As a result, kosher meat is permitted by some Muslim communities, and is sometimes substituted for halal meat.

Sikhism forbids eating meat from animals that were slaughtered slowly or with religious ritual, referred to as &quot;kutha meat&quot;. This includes halal meat preparation. The religiously recommended method of slaughter among Sikhs, known as , is likewise incompatible with halal principles, as with this method not all of the blood is drained from the meat.

====Concerns for animal welfare====

Stunning of the animal is not allowed before slaughtering, unless necessary to calm down a violent animal. However, the UK Food Standards Agency figures from 2011 suggest that 84% of cattle, 81% of sheep and 88% of chickens slaughtered for halal meat were stunned before they died. Supermarkets selling halal products also report that all animals are stunned before they are slaughtered. Tesco, for example, says &quot;the only difference between the halal meat it sells and other meat is that it was blessed as it was killed.&quot; Concerns about animal suffering from slaughter without prior stunning has resulted in the ban of slaughter of unstunned animals in Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

===Certification===
Certification for halal products is given by legal authorities in most Muslim-majority countries, while in other countries, it is voluntarily acquired by companies and issued by non-governmental organizations for an annual fee.

==== Halal certification in the US ====
Halal certifications are provided by a number of agencies in the United States. Depending on how the certification will be used for domestic or international export, the certification may need to be done by a qualified entity. If it&#x27;s for domestic use a local agency with proper knowledge, training and background can issue a halal certificate. If the certificate is going to be used for export then the halal certifier needs to be accredited by the country the halal product is being exported to. A company that needs to certify its product must do their due diligence when hiring a certifier. There are a number of halal certifiers in the US including ISWA Halal; ISA Halal; Halal Monitoring Services (HMS), based out of Chicago, Illinois; and the Halal Food Standards Alliance of America (HFSAA), based out of Oakland, California. Another agency that can help companies identify and screen the proper halal certifier is the US Halal Consultants based in Fairfax, Virginia.

==== Criticism ====
In Australia, halal food certification has been criticized by groups who claim that certifying foods as halal leads to consumers subsidizing a particular religious belief. Australian Federation of Islamic Councils spokesman Keysar Trad told a journalist in July 2014 that this was an attempt to exploit anti-Muslim sentiments in Australia. A study in 2022 showed that halal certifications did not necessarily reflect the extent to which a halal product came about in whole, and called for greater means of assurance and transparent qualitative methods of halal certification.

=== Business ===
The Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated the global industry value of halal food consumer purchases to be $1.1 trillion in 2013, accounting for 16.6 percent of the global food and beverage market, with an annual growth of 6.9 percent. Growth regions include Indonesia ($197 million market value in 2012) and Turkey ($100 million). The European Union market for halal food has an estimated annual growth of around 15 percent and is worth an estimated $30 billion, approximately $8 billion of which are accounted for in France.

The halal food and beverage industry has also made a significant impact on supermarkets and other food business such as restaurants. French supermarkets had halal food sales totalling $210 million in 2011, a 10.5% growth from five years prior. In France, the market for halal foods is even larger than the market for other types of common foods. For example, in 2010, the market for halal foods and beverages in France was nearly twice that of organic foods. Auchan, a large French supermarket chain, now sells 80 certified halal meat products, along with 30 pre-cooked halal meals and 40 frozen halal products. Upscale restaurants and catering services have also added halal foods to their menus. In addition, many beverage companies such as Evian have taken the effort to add a halal stamp on their products to show that their water and other beverages are pure and not haram or forbidden under Islamic law.

===Interaction with global regulation===
Halal standards and regulations have been considered as an obstacle to international trade while the discrimination towards import products also lacks transparency. Trade disputes related to halal have emerged even among Muslim and Islamic countries, for instance at the regional level within the ASEAN.

==== European Union ====
On 17 December 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that member countries may ban religious slaughter to promote animal welfare and could impose non-lethal stunning before the killing of animals. The ruling was in response to a challenge to a 2017 Flemish government prohibition on the killing of animals without prior non-lethal (also called reversible) stunning by Jewish and Muslim associations.

==== India ====

The Muslim community has been receptive of halal food and certification. Members of the right-wing Hindutva groups in India have protested against the sale of Halal food in India. Bajrang Dal, Vishva Hindu Parishad and other Hindutva groups have run door to door campaigns in the state of Karnataka, asking people not to purchase halal meat. In March 2022 the Hindutva group Bajrang Dal physically attacked a Muslim meat seller, five persons were arrested in the incident. In March 2022, C. T. Ravi, national general secretary for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, referred to halal food as &quot;economic jihad&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
, an estimated 27 UK Tesco supermarkets, in addition to most urban Asda and many Morrisons supermarkets, had halal meat counters, selling meat approved for consumption by Muslims. According to the Food Standards Agency Animal Welfare Update report, published September 2017, 16 percent of animals slaughtered by the halal method were not stunned before slaughter, which violates RSPCA standards on animal welfare. However, it is legal in the UK due to an exemption in the law granted to Jews and Muslims.

== Non-food applications ==

In addition to food and diet, a halal lifestyle can include travel, finance, clothing, media, recreation, cosmetics. A halal lifestyle can even involve professional practises ranging from industrial and manufacturing logistics to supply chains.

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
Some Muslims refrain from using pharmaceuticals that are not halal. This distinction is most noticeably practiced in Malaysia, which has a large halal pharmaceutical industry, complete with government regulations to make sure the products are . On the other hand, the Quran obliges Muslims to seek treatment, including preventive ones, for diseases regardless of what the care provider believes in. In particular, medicines containing animal products like gelatin have been deemed permissible by a 1995 council of Islamic jurisprudents, making such distinction unnecessary. The decentralized nature of Islam allows both opinions to exist.

===Vaccines===

The controversy over pharmaceuticals has led to the refusal of childhood vaccination in some Muslim-majority countries, despite many religious leaders expressly endorsing vaccination. It is also a concern in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.

=== Personal care ===
Feminine hygiene products and diapers have been certified as halal in Malaysia. Such certification is not required by the religion, nor is there a demand from Muslims. Critics consider such &quot;unnecessary&quot; certification as little more than a marketing gimmick, e.g., halal labels on clearly vegetarian soft drinks or naturally grown food items like cereals, pulses, vegetables and processed foods made exclusively from vegetable products.

<doc id="414867" wikidata="Q2383069" url="?curid=414867" title="Victoria Charter">
<text>The Victoria Charter was a set of proposed amendments to the Constitution of Canada in 1971. This document represented a failed attempt on the part of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to patriate the Constitution, add a bill of rights to it and entrench English and French as Canada&#x27;s official languages; he later succeeded in all these objectives in 1982 with the enactment of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

==Content==
The Charter would have also terminated the powers of disallowance and reservation, which remain in the Constitution. There was also a bill of rights and a new amending formula.

===Bill of rights===
The Victoria Charter began with the title &quot;Part I – Political Rights&quot;, which contained nine &quot;articles.&quot; This bill of rights, however, was not as elaborate as Canada&#x27;s current constitutional bill of rights, the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

The first article &quot;declared&quot; the existence of freedom of expression and freedom of religion, and like the 1960 &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, stipulated that &quot;all laws shall be construed and applied so as not to abrogate or abridge any such freedom.&quot; Article 2 established the applicability of the bill of rights to Parliament and the legislatures, and article 3 allowed for reasonable limits on rights (compare this to section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot;).

Article 4 recognized the importance of the right to vote, and article 5 elaborated on this by saying the right could not be denied due to race, religion or sex. Articles 6 and 7 set the maximum duration of the House of Commons of Canada and provincial legislatures at five years (a function now assumed by section 4 of the &quot;Charter&quot;).

===Language rights===
Language rights were covered by Part II of the Victoria Charter. Article 10 recognized Canada&#x27;s official bilingualism and article 11 allowed bilingualism in Parliament and in the legislatures of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.

===Judicial system===
Parts IV and V dealt with the court system of Canada, with Part IV discussing the Supreme Court of Canada. Article 22 recognized the existence of the Supreme Court, in contrast to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which merely permitted Parliament to create such a court.

Articles 24 to 33 dealt with Supreme Court appointments. Article 25 would have constitutionalized the requirement that three judges should come from Quebec, and articles 26 to 30 assigned partial responsibility of appointments to both federal and provincial justice ministers. Their choices, however, would be narrowed down and approved by a council (under article 31).

Part V was much shorter, consisting of article 43, which permitted Parliament to regulate the organization of courts.

===Equal opportunity===
Like section 36 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, Part VII of the Victoria Charter addressed &quot;Regional Disparities&quot;. Article 46 emphasized the values of equality of opportunity and assurances to public services. It also emphasized &quot;economic development&quot; to reduce regional disparities.

However, article 47 clarified that article 46 could not be used to force Parliament or the provincial legislatures to take any sort of action, and clarified article 46 would not affect the current division of powers. Thus, Part VII served to recognize values not meant to be enforced by courts.

===Amending formula===
The Charter set up an amending formula that would give vetoes to the federal government and the two largest provinces, Ontario and Quebec. Later, when the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; was enacted, no province was given the veto, except in certain areas where unanimity is required. (The lack of veto power for Quebec was discussed and upheld by the Supreme Court in the Quebec Veto Reference.) In contrast, the Meech Lake Accord, proposed amendments in 1987–1990, would have given every province the veto in relation to certain matters.

The premier of the third largest province, British Columbia, also wanted this power, but the Victoria Charter did not recognize any veto for British Columbia. It did, however, stipulate that at least two provinces in Western Canada should approve an amendment, and that these provinces should contain half or more of the total Western population. The majority of provinces would be needed for amendments to pass, and this would also have to include two provinces in Atlantic Canada.

==Negotiations==
The Charter failed when the premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, stalled and rejected it. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Trudeau recalled Bourassa had slowed negotiations after all provinces had accepted the Charter. Bourassa did this by coming up with a new proposal that would give provinces supremacy over social policy, and the federal government would provide the money for such policy. Trudeau replied he could never agree to this proposal, and Bourassa retracted his approval of the Charter. Bourassa&#x27;s explanation for not accepting the Charter immediately was that he would have to ask his cabinet and he was worried Quebec nationalists and students would rally against the Charter. Eventually such protests did occur.

==Legacy==
Trudeau blamed Bourassa&#x27;s rejection of the Charter for the later victory of the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; in provincial elections in 1976 and for the Meech Lake Accord, since Bourassa had cost Quebec a constitutional veto. &quot;Much of Bourassa&#x27;s subsequent career has been spent trying to regain what he was once so unwise as to refuse,&quot; Trudeau wrote.

<text>Joseph Ritner (March 25, 1780 – October 16, 1869) was the eighth governor of Pennsylvania, and was a member of the Anti-Masonic Party. Elected governor during the 1835 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, he served from 1835 to 1839.

Controversy surrounding his defeat in the 1838 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election sparked the Buckshot War.

In 1856, Governor Ritner served as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.

==Early life==
Ritner was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on March 25, 1780. His parents were of German heritage, and Ritner was primarily self-educated, including learning to read and write in English, while also acquiring a working knowledge of German. He moved to Cumberland County as a teenager, where he worked as a farm hand and laborer until he purchased a farm of his own in Washington County. In 1801, Ritner married Susan Alter, and they were the parents of 10 children. The Washington County farm had been owned by Ritner&#x27;s wife&#x27;s uncle, and included a large library, which enabled Ritner to continue his efforts at self-study.

During the War of 1812, Ritner served first as commander of a Washington County militia company, the Rifle Rangers. He later served as a private with his regiment in western Pennsylvania and Ohio.

==Political career==
In 1820, Ritner was elected road supervisor in Washington County. Later that year he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Democratic-Republican. He was reelected five times, and was Speaker in his final two terms.

Ritner became involved with the Anti-Masonic movement in the late 1820s, and after two defeats by George Wolf in his bids to become governor, he was finally successful during the 1835 election. A large crowd attended his inaugural ceremonies on December 15, 1835.

When the Second Bank of the United States lost its federal charter in 1836, Ritner signed legislation giving it a state charter. As a supporter of public education, Ritner prevented repeal of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Public School Law of 1834, and succeeded in passage of an enhanced public school measure in 1836.

An ardent opponent of slavery, Ritner was the inspiration for an abolitionist poem by John Greenleaf Whittier, 1836&#x27;s &quot;Ritner&quot;, in which Whittier praised the anti-slavery sentiment of the governor&#x27;s annual message to the state legislature.

Toward the end of his tenure as governor, major changes were effected in Pennsylvania&#x27;s system of state governance. The Pennsylvania State Constitution was amended, all White freemen over the age of twenty-one were given the right to vote, and the practice of awarding official positions as &quot;life offices&quot; was abolished.

Ritner&#x27;s reputation, however, was negatively affected by Anti-Masonic efforts to gerrymander state legislative districts for their benefit. In addition, as Anti-Masons attempted to expand their support by taking positions on other issues, including expanded construction of public works. During this time, Ritner was criticized for allegedly using public rail and canal projects as a source of patronage.

When he ran for a second term as a Whig Party-supported, Anti-Masonic candidate during the controversial 1838 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, which grew increasingly heated as anti-Masonic and anti-abolitionist rhetoric rose, he narrowly lost to Democratic nominee David Rittenhouse Porter, who, as a Grand Master of the Huntingdon Lodge of the Freemasons, had risen to the level of Deputy Grand Master of his Masonic district. Ritner and his supporters then unsuccessfully attempted to contest the election, including an effort by Ritner to mobilize the state militia, which sparked the Buckshot War. (The militia were to be armed with buckshot, thus giving the event its name.)

After leaving office, Ritner settled on a farm in Cumberland County. He suffered from cataracts, and surgery in 1839 restored the sight in his right eye, though he remained blind in his left.

With the end of the Anti-Masonic Party, Ritner actively supported the Whigs. In 1849 newly elected Whig President Zachary Taylor nominated Ritner for the post of Director of the United States Mint, then in Philadelphia. Taylor died before the nomination was acted on, so Ritner was never confirmed.

Ritner joined the Republican Party when it was founded in the mid-1850s, and was a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention.

==Death and interment==
He died on October 16, 1869, and was buried at Mount Rock Cemetery in Mount Rock, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
Governor Ritner has a residence hall named in his honor on the University Park campus of Penn State. Ritner Street in Philadelphia is also named in his honor.

In 1938, the state of Pennsylvania dedicated the Governor Ritner Highway, which connects Carlisle and Shippensburg along Route 11 in Cumberland County.

Harper was elected chief of the Red Sucker Lake Indian Band in 1978, serving for four years and worked as a policy analyst prior to entering politics. He was a key factor in the rejection of the Meech Lake Accord, a proposed amendment of the Canadian constitution.

== Early life and education ==
Harper was born in Red Sucker Lake, a reserve in northern Manitoba. He attended residential schools in Norway House, Brandon and Birtle, Manitoba, then secondary school at Garden Hill and Winnipeg. He studied at the University of Manitoba in 1971 and 1972. He later worked as a community development worker, a supervisor for the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood, and a program analyst for the Manitoba Department of Northern Affairs.

== Political career ==
In 1978, he was elected as the Chief for Red Sucker Lake Band (now Red Sucker Lake First Nation), a position he held for four years.

In 1981, Harper contested and won the sprawling northern Manitoba riding of Rupertsland for the New Democratic Party (NDP) to become the first Treaty Indian to be elected as a provincial politician. He was re-elected in the 1986 Manitoba general election. On April 17, 1986, he was appointed to cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio, responsible for Native Affairs. On February 4, 1987, he was named minister of northern affairs and minister in charge of the &quot;Communities Economic Fund Act&quot;.

Harper was dropped from the Cabinet on September 9, 1987, after being involved in a car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol. No one was injured in the incident. Harper subsequently pleaded guilty to refusing a breathalyzer test, leaving the scene of an accident and driving while impaired. He was fined $450, and his driver&#x27;s licence was suspended for a year. Harper acknowledged his mistake, and entered an alcohol-rehabilitation program. He stopped drinking for good, and voluntarily stopped driving for five years. He was reappointed as minister of northern affairs and minister responsible for native affairs, on November 23, 1987, and served in that role until the defeat of Howard Pawley&#x27;s government in 1988. He was again re-elected at the 1988 Manitoba general election.

===Role in Meech Lake Accord===
In 1990, Harper achieved national fame for his refusal to accept the Meech Lake Accord, a constitutional amendment package negotiated to gain Quebec&#x27;s acceptance of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. Under the Manitoba legislature&#x27;s rules of the day, the legislature had to unanimously consent to a motion for emergency debate that would bring the Accord up for vote. Harper was displeased that the Accord had been negotiated in 1987 without the input of Canada&#x27;s First Nations.

There were only twelve days before the ratification deadline for the Accord. Each day, the Manitoba government requested unanimous consent in the Assembly to consider the resolution. Each day, Harper, while holding an eagle feather, denied unanimous consent, so the resolution could not be debated. As a result, Newfoundland premier Clyde Wells cancelled a proposed vote on the Accord in the General Assembly of Newfoundland. Since the Meech Lake Accord failed to pass in both Manitoba and Newfoundland, the constitution was not amended. The same year, he won the Stanley Knowles Humanitarian Award, was voted as the &quot;Newsmaker of the Year in Canada&quot; by the Canadian Press, was awarded the title of Honorary Chief for Life by Red Sucker Lake First Nation, and received a commemorative medal of Canada from the governor general for his efforts in public service. Harper also opposed the Charlottetown Accord in 1992.

===Federal politics===
Harper resigned from the Manitoba legislature on November 30, 1992 with the intention of running in the federal election due in 1993. He initially wanted to run for the federal New Democratic Party in the northern riding of Churchill. However, the NDP leadership rebuffed him because that riding&#x27;s NDP incumbent, Rod Murphy, was not willing to stand down in Harper&#x27;s favour. After considering offers from several parties, Harper agreed to join the Liberal Party in early 1993. He claimed that this change in party affiliation did not reflect a change in his principles; he intended to represent native interests in parliament, party lines notwithstanding. His presence in the Liberal Party was controversial, however; many former allies considered his decision misguided, and some Quebec Liberals did not want to be associated with the man who brought down Meech Lake.

Harper defeated Murphy in the 1993 election. He was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Aboriginal Affairs. He was defeated by New Democrat Bev Desjarlais in the 1997 election, and again in the 2000 election.

===Later work===
Elijah Harper was appointed commissioner of the Indian Claims Commission on January 21, 1999, and remained in demand as a speaker until his death.

==Legacy==
For his work for his people, Harper received the Stanley Knowles Humanitarian Award in 1991, and a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, in 1996.

A film based on Harper&#x27;s life focusing in particular on the month of June 1990, when Harper blocked the Manitoba legislature from voting on the Meech Lake Accord, was directed by Paul Unwin and played in 2007 at the Vancouver International Film Festival. The film, entitled &quot;Elijah&quot;, was produced for the CTV Television Network. It stars Billy Merasty in the title role.

==Personal life and death==

Harper had some personal controversy. Creditors as well as his ex-wife sued him for financial claims in 1991.

Harper also had health problems. In the autumn of 1994 he had a mysterious illness doctors and native healers could not explain. On May 17, 2013, he died of heart failure due to complications from diabetes in Ottawa.

&quot;It is always very difficult to go against the wind, and to stand up straight and say no when the easier path is to give in and go in the direction of the wind. I will always remember the image of Elijah Harper&#x27;s courage and determination and his profound conviction&quot;, stated Ghislain Picard, Chief of the Assembly of the First Nations of Quebec and Labrador.

On May 20, 2013, Harper&#x27;s open casket was draped with the flag of Manitoba as he lay in state at the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg where hundreds of supporters filed through to pay their respects. A funeral service took place later that day at the Glory and Peace Church in Winnipeg. Harper was buried at Red Sucker Lake First Nation.

<doc id="414872" wikidata="Q2159009" url="?curid=414872" title="Robert Treat">
<text>Robert Treat (February 23, 1622July 12, 1710) was an English-born politician, military officer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of Connecticut from 1683 to 1687 and 1689 to 1698. In 1666, he co-founded the colonial settlement of Newark, New Jersey.

==Early life==

Robert Treat was born on February 23, 1622 in Pitminster, Somerset and emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with his family in 1630. His father was Richard Treat and his mother was Alice Gaylord. In 1637, his family were early settlers at Wethersfield, Connecticut. He settled in Milford, Connecticut in 1639 and became one of the leaders of the New Haven Colony, serving in the General Court as its assembly was known.

On Christmas Day, 1647 he married Jane Tapp in Milford, with whom he had eight children. Jane died on October 31, 1703. He then married Mrs. Elizabeth (Powell) Bryan, the daughter of Elder Michael and Abigail Powell of Boston, on October 24, 1705. She was twice widowed before marrying Gov. Treat. She died on January 10, 1706.

==Career==
When the Connecticut Charter of 1662 forced the New Haven Colony to merge with Connecticut in 1665, Treat led a group of dissidents who left the colony. They moved to New Jersey in 1666 where they were joined by other dissidents from Branford, Connecticut, another part of the former New Haven Colony. The dissidents from Branford were led by Abraham Pierson, the elder. Treat wanted the new community to be named Milford. Pierson, a devout Puritan, preferred the name New Ark, and this place is now known as Newark. Treat returned to Milford, Connecticut in 1672 and lived there the rest of his life.

Treat headed the colony&#x27;s militia for several years, principally against the Narragansett people. This included participating in King Philip&#x27;s War in 1676, where he was named Commander-in-Chief of Connecticut&#x27;s forces. Treat, for example, had a crucial role in fighting that took place near Deerfield, Massachusetts, along with 300 Connecticut militiamen. He also took part in the Great Swamp Fight, one of the bloodiest battles of the war, against the Narragansetts. He served on the Governor&#x27;s Council continuously from 1676 to 1708.

First elected Governor in 1683, Treat was supplanted by Sir Edmund Andros in 1687, making Connecticut part of the Dominion of New England. Treat is credited with having a role in concealing the state&#x27;s charter in the Charter Oak, and resumed his job as governor when the dominion scheme fell apart in 1689. He was re-elected annually until being defeated by Fitz-John Winthrop in 1698.

==Death==
Treat died in Milford, New Haven County, Connecticut, on July 12, 1710. He is interred at Milford Cemetery in Connecticut.

== Notable descendants ==
His descendants include:
* Robert Treat Paine (1731–1814), signer of the Declaration of Independence
* Israel Crane (1758–1848), merchant in Cranetown (present-day Montclair, NJ)
*Thomas Edison (1847–1931), inventor
* Sidney Mason Stone (1803–1882), architect
*Margaret Sidney (1844–1924) author of Five Little Peppers children&#x27;s series.
* Nathaniel Treat (1798–1895), politician
* Joseph B. Treat (1836–1919), politician
* Charles Treat (1859–1941), general
* Charles H. Treat (1842–1910), Treasurer of the United States from 1905 to 1909
* Charles W. Woodworth (1865–1940), entomologist

<doc id="414874" wikidata="Q3215053" url="?curid=414874" title="Meech Lake">
<text>Meech Lake () is located within Gatineau Park in the Municipality of Chelsea, Quebec, Canada. It is located about 20 km northwest of Gatineau. The lake was named after Reverend Asa Meech, an early settler in the area.

Near the lake, on Meech Creek, are the ruins of a fertilizer plant built by Thomas &quot;Carbide&quot; Willson during the 1900s. In 1981, Willson&#x27;s former summer home (the Willson House) on Meech Lake was converted into a government conference centre. The house is notable for its use, in 1987, as the site of meetings on the Meech Lake Accord (which proposed the overhauling of Canada&#x27;s constitution) between the provincial premiers and then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

The lake is a multi-use area with picnicking, beach goers, boats, paddle boards, and historic cottages dating to before the park was formed. It is a popular lake for people who like to train in open water swimming. It is also the site of the annual Meech Lake Triathlon.

In 1988, a study conducted for the NCC confirmed that Meech Lake residents are responsible for most of the human-produced phosphorus flowing into the lake, i.e., 70.2%, whereas visitors only account for 29.8%. Phosphorus, in excessive amounts is responsible for the proliferation of blue-green algae, a problem that has afflicted the lake in recent years.

The National Capital Commission (NCC), steward of Gatineau Park, operates beaches on the lake during the summer. Although it is not condoned by the NCC, there is a secluded beach often used by naturists. Lack of clear signage on the lake that fires are prohibited as well as enforcement is one problem of this highly used area. For example, in the summer of 2016, a fire on one island caused by a picnicker resulted in 25% of the island burning.

<doc id="414875" wikidata="Q1865524" url="?curid=414875" title="Marcel Mariën">
<text>Marcel Mariën (29 April 1920 – 19 September 1993) was a Belgian surrealist (later Situationist), poet, essayist, photographer, collagist, and filmmaker.

Mariën was a pivotal member of the Belgian wing of the Surrealist movement. In addition to his work as a surrealist artist and photographer, he was also known as a publisher, bookseller, sailor, journalist in China and an elaborate Surrealist prankster.

==Early life==

Marcel Mariën was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1920. He was a single child from a poor family. At the age of fifteen, Mariën left school to become a photographer&#x27;s apprentice.
In 1937, after viewing an exhibition of the surrealist paintings of René Magritte, he travelled to Brussels to apprentice for the painter. The next year, he exhibited his own artwork titled &quot;L&#x27;INTROUVABLE&quot; (The Untraceable) alongside Magritte in the Surrealist group exhibition &quot;Surrealist Objects and Poems&quot; in London.

Mariën enlisted in the Belgian Army in Antwerp in January 1939 and served for seventeen months during World War II. During the German invasion of Belgium, he looked after the casualties at the hospital of Antwerp before being evacuated, bringing along two large bags of books which he refused to leave behind. Upon reaching Dunkirk, he was taken captive and held as a prisoner of war in Görlitz for nine months.

Following his release, he returned to Brussels and, in 1943, wrote and published the very first monograph on Magritte.
==Art==
Mariën&#x27;s early attempts at expressing his ideas in photography were unsuccessful. It was not until 1943 that he produced his first photograph with a distinctive personal vision, &quot;De Sade à Lénine&quot;, an image of a woman cutting a slice of bread, the loaf gripped tightly against her naked torso, the blade pointing at her left breast. Mariën commented, &quot;the knife passes from de Sade to Lenin&quot;.

It was pure Surrealism, marked with the two themes that would characterize his photography: the everyday object stripped of its traditional function and the female body as an instrument of creation.

Despite this and other successful photographs, Mariën would soon abandon photography to concentrate on object-making, drawing and writing. Forever a restless spirit, in 1951 he signed on for two years as a sailor on a Danish cargo ship. In 1962, he lived in New York for a year before relocating to Communist China from 1963 until 1965, where he worked as a translator on the French edition of the magazine &quot;China Under Construction&quot; until his disillusionment with Maoism.

In 1959, in a further attempt to challenge traditional attitudes, he produced and directed the film, &quot;L&#x27;Imitation du cinema&quot;. A combination of sexual and religious imagery, it caused a scandal in Belgium and was banned in France. Even with the support of the Kinsey Institute, it proved impossible to have the film shown in the United States.

==Writer, publisher and essayist==
Although Marien worked as an artist across many media, some of the most notable achievements throughout his career were as a chronicler of the Belgian Surrealists&#x27; activities and a publisher of their writings. He contributed to various publications, including &quot;London Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;art&quot;, and &quot;View&quot;.

In 1943, Marien published the very first monograph on Magritte. In 1954 he founded the magazine, &quot;Les Lèvres Nues&quot;, and directed his review &quot;Le Ciel Bleu&quot; with Christian Dotremont and Paul Colinet. He published the writings of such Belgian Surrealists as Paul Nougé, Louis Scutenaire and André Souris, as well as Magritte himself, in a series that eventually extended to hundreds of titles.

In 1979, Marien published &quot;L&#x27;Activité Surréaliste en Belgique&quot;, a chronological record of all the documents, manifestos, tracts and articles pertaining to the surrealist movement in Belgium that appeared between 1924 and 1950.

Even as late as 1983, the appearance of his outrageously libellous autobiography in &quot;Le Radeau de la Mémoire&quot; was able to cause a scandal.

==Prankster==
Mariën and his fellow Surrealists loved making jokes. In 1953, Mariën went to the Belgian coast, where he distributed false bank notes printed by René and Paul Magritte. In 1962, the joke was on Magritte when Mariën and Leo Dohmen produced a tract, &quot;La Grande Baisse&quot;, to coincide with a major retrospective of Magritte&#x27;s work in Knokke. Presented as written by Magritte himself, it announced drastic discounts on the artist&#x27;s major paintings and offered the chance to order them in different sizes.

Even leading Surrealists, amongst them André Breton, failed to grasp the joke and praised Magritte for this undertaking. Magritte was furious when he found out and the 25-year friendship between Magritte and Mariën was over.

===International Prize for Human Stupidity===
In 1955 Mariën established the International Prize for Human Stupidity. King Baudouin of Belgium was awarded the first prize.

==Return to photography==
In 1980, Mariën returned to his roots in surrealist photography. He became extremely prolific until his death in Brussels in 1993, often posing nude female models with strange objects or in absurd situations.

<text>Mad TV (stylized as MADtv) is an American sketch comedy television series created by David Salzman, Fax Bahr, and Adam Small. Loosely based on the humor magazine &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;&#x27;s pre-taped satirical sketches were primarily parodies of popular culture and occasionally politics. Many of its sketches featured the show&#x27;s cast members playing recurring original characters and doing celebrity impressions. The series premiered on Fox on October 14, 1995, and ran for 14 seasons. Its final episode aired on May 16, 2009.

Salzman created &quot;Mad TV&quot; with record producer Quincy Jones after they purchased the rights to &quot;Mad&quot; in 1995. Salzman brought on Bahr and Small, who had formerly written for the sketch comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot;, as showrunners. The show was intended to compete with fellow sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;), which was experiencing declining viewership and poor critical reception. Critics noted that &quot;Mad TV&quot; had a more diverse cast than &quot;SNL&quot; and dealt with edgier, more lowbrow humor&quot;.&quot;

Fox made few efforts to promote &quot;Mad TV&quot;, which typically fell behind &quot;SNL&quot; in ratings. Throughout its run, the network continually cut the series&#x27; budget before eventually canceling it in 2009. It was nominated for numerous awards, including 43 Primetime Emmy Awards, five of which it won. Critical reception of the series was mostly negative during its run and its sketches attracted notable controversy. Since its cancellation, it has appeared on several critics&#x27; lists of the best sketch comedy television series of all time.

A 20th anniversary reunion special aired on The CW on January 12, 2016. The CW also rebooted the series for a 15th and final season, which premiered on July 26, 2016.

==Development==
William Gaines, who owned EC Comics and published the American humor magazine &quot;Mad&quot; from 1950 until his death in 1992, refused to sell the rights to the magazine as he disliked television. In 1995, three years after Gaines&#x27;s death, EC Comics sold the rights to &quot;Mad&quot; to record producer Quincy Jones and TV producer David Salzman. The two launched &quot;Mad TV&quot; through their joint venture, QDE.

Fax Bahr and Adam Small were hired as the showrunners of &quot;Mad TV&quot; alongside Salzman. They had previously worked as staff writers on the sketch comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot; since 1992. The two left the show in its third season. The series began with 12 writers, including Patton Oswalt, Blaine Capatch, and writers from &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;. Its pilot episode premiered on October 14, 1995, at 11 p.m. on Fox. The network approved of the pilot and ordered 12 episodes for its first season, which was heavily inspired by the eponymous magazine. It was pre-taped and contained a combination of short live-action sketches, movie parodies, and animated sketches. Animated segments of &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;, a wordless comic strip originally featured in &quot;Mad&quot; and created by Antonio Prohías, appeared on the first four seasons of &quot;Mad TV&quot;. The show&#x27;s theme song was created by American hip hop group Heavy D &amp; the Boyz, who had previously created the theme song for &quot;In Living Color&quot;, and composed by Greg O&#x27;Connor and Blake Aaron, the latter of whom was &quot;Mad TV&quot;&#x27;s guitarist. Filming took place in Hollywood at Hollywood Center Studios and later at Sunset Bronson Studios.

The series satirized popular culture, with sketches parodying film, television and music. Sketches often featured celebrity impressions and occasionally contained political satire, and Fox executive Joe Earley called the series &quot;an equal opportunity offender&quot;. Bruce Leddy became the show&#x27;s director and supervising producer starting in 2000. After &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s first season, Fox rarely promoted the series and frequently made budget cuts, with cast and crew members such as Debra Wilson and Bahr referring to the series as the &quot;redheaded stepchild&quot; of Fox. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s James Hibbard wrote prior to its cancellation that &quot;Mad TV&quot; had been &quot;like a distant cousin of [Fox&#x27;s] other programming&quot; during its runtime; David Nevins, Fox&#x27;s former executive vice president of programming, attributed the lack of promotion to Fox focusing on advertising its new prime time series instead. Fox executives and &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s showrunners often shot down sketch ideas that were viewed admirably by the staff writers, who wanted the show to be &quot;edgy&quot;. &quot;Mad TV&quot; was partially intended to compete with fellow late-night sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which, at the time of &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s debut, was being poorly received by critics. However, &quot;SNL&quot; quickly bounced back and &quot;Mad TV&quot; typically trailed behind the show in ratings.

In November 2008, Fox confirmed that &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s 326th episode during its shortened 14th season would be its last, telling Salzman that the show was too expensive considering its ratings and time slot. By this point, it was the fourth longest-running Fox series after &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Cops&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. Salzman said that he would be exploring the continuation of the show on another channel, possibly cable. In early 2009, the show was briefly moved to air after &quot;Talkshow with Spike Feresten&quot;, the show that normally followed &quot;MADtv&quot;, before being moved back. The series finale aired on May 16, 2009. It featured both new and old sketches and revolved around a fictional telethon called &quot;&quot;Mad TV&quot; Gives Back&quot;.

===Reunion special===
&quot;Mad TV&quot; had a one-hour-long 20th anniversary reunion special, titled &quot;MADtv 20th Anniversary Reunion&quot;. It was executive produced by Salzman, directed by Bruce Leddy, and produced by Telepictures and Epicenter Ventures. It aired on The CW on January 12, 2016, at 8 p.m. and garnered 1.7 million viewers. Its plot involved 19 returning cast members going to an awards show where things go awry.

== Cast and characters ==


&quot;Mad TV&quot;″s cast was considered diverse by critics, especially compared to that of &quot;SNL&quot;. According to casting director Nicole Garcia, the showrunners sought a diverse cast from the beginning of the series. Its first season starred Debra Wilson, Nicole Sullivan, Phil LaMarr, Artie Lange, Mary Scheer, Bryan Callen, Orlando Jones, and David Herman.

Wilson was the first cast member hired for &quot;Mad TV&quot;. She starred in the first eight seasons of the series from 1995 to 2003, making her the longest-running original cast member and the only Black female cast member during her time on the show. She later stated that she left the series in 2003 after learning that she received a lower salary than a White male cast member who had joined after she did, and that her salary negotiations had failed. Sullivan was added to the cast because, according to her, Bahr and Small wanted someone on the show who &quot;the audience would like to have dinner with&quot;. She starred on the show from 1995 to 2001 and left to star in the ABC sitcom &quot;Me and My Needs&quot;, which was not picked up by the network after its pilot episode. Herman starred in the short-lived Fox sketch comedy series &quot;House of Buggin&#x27;&quot; before appearing on &quot;Mad TV&quot;, while Jones had written for the Fox series &quot;Roc&quot;. Jones, Callen, and Lange all left the show after its second season.

Michael McDonald starred on &quot;Mad TV&quot; for ten seasons starting in 1998 and was the show&#x27;s longest-running and oldest cast member, also occasionally directing segments. The show&#x27;s second longest-running cast member was Aries Spears, who appeared in 198 episodes from its third season in 1997 until its tenth season in 2005. Other popular cast members included Alex Borstein, who starred on the show for five seasons from 1997 to 2002; Ike Barinholtz, who joined in 2002 and left in 2007; Will Sasso, who joined the show in its third season; Mo Collins, who joined in 1998 and left in 2004; Stephnie Weir, who starred on the show for six years; Nicole Parker, who appeared on six seasons of the show; and Bobby Lee, who appeared on eight seasons of the show from 2001 to 2009. Other cast members, such as Andy Daly, Simon Helberg, and Taran Killam, the last of whom was the youngest person ever to be cast on the show, found fame after brief tenures on &quot;Mad TV&quot;. Comedians Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key met after being cast on &quot;Mad TV&quot; in 2004 for its ninth season, and the two would later star together in the Comedy Central sketch comedy series &quot;Key &amp; Peele&quot;. Peele left the series in 2008, while Key stayed until the show&#x27;s final season.

Borstein and Peele were both kept from leaving &quot;Mad TV&quot; to pursue other roles due to their contracts, with Borstein having to turn down a role as Sookie on the CW series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and Peele turning down a role playing Barack Obama for &quot;SNL&quot;.

===Recurring characters===
Numerous characters and sketches on &quot;Mad TV&quot; became notable for their frequent appearances. Michael McDonald played Stuart Larkin, an overgrown, spoiled child with a bowl cut, bright red cheeks, and a rainbow plaid shirt. His overbearing single mother, Doreen (played by Mo Collins), has a strong Wisconsin accent and was inspired by McDonald&#x27;s own mother. Sketches with Stuart often involve him and his mother visiting various businesses where he frustrates the employees with his antics. He has a number of catch phrases, including &quot;Look what I can do!&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t wanna say,&quot; &quot;Let me do it!&quot;, and &quot;Dooooon&#x27;t!&quot;, while his mother always mentions that Stuart&#x27;s father &quot;left us on Tuesday&quot;. Stuart appeared in 38 sketches in nine seasons from 1998 to 2008. He was described by Megh Wright of &quot;Vulture&quot; as the show&#x27;s most memorable character and by Thomas Attila Lewis of &quot;LAist&quot; as &quot;incredibly popular&quot;.

Alex Borstein appeared in 44 sketches as the popular recurring character of Bunny Swan, better known as Ms. Swan, an immigrant nail salon owner and manicurist with a strong, exaggerated accent who annoys others by not being able to answer simple questions. She has a bob cut and wears a muumuu and a rainbow plaid jumper; she also has catch phrases such as &quot;He look-a like-a man&quot;. Although Ms. Swan was presumed by audiences to be Asian, the series identifies her as hailing from Kuvaria, the home of Santa Claus, while Borstein stated that her inspirations for the character were her Hungarian-Jewish grandmother, and Icelandic singer Björk. Elahe Izadi of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; included the Ms. Swan sketches on a list of the &quot;20 defining comedy sketches of the past 20 years&quot; in 2019, writing that they were &quot;among the most widely remembered of &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s work&quot;. Borstein briefly reprised the role outside of &quot;Mad TV&quot; for a parody of the trailer for the 2010 film &quot;Black Swan&quot; and for a video about the 2016 United States presidential election.

Kathy Wajanowski, aka The Vancome Lady, is an emotionally abusive, racist woman who struggled to keep a job due to her ignorant remarks, was played by Nicole Sullivan and made over 25 appearances on the show, starting with its pilot episode and was the first recurring character on the show. She was described by Candace Amos of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; as &quot;one of the characters fans loved to hate&quot;. A sketch featuring cast member Anjelah Johnson as the irritable Latina fast food worker Bon Qui Qui became popular on YouTube. Johnson has frequently reprised the character since, releasing the album &quot;Gold Plated Dreams&quot; as the character in 2015 through Warner Records.

Many of the show&#x27;s recurring characters were parodies of celebrities such as Will Sasso&#x27;s portrayal of singer Randy Newman and Aries Spears&#x27;s portrayal of Bill Cosby. Debra Wilson and Aries Spears frequently appeared on the show as married singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, who they portrayed as drug-addled, frantic, and &quot;ghetto&quot;. Along with her impression of Houston, Wilson also earned fame and acclaim for her impression of Oprah Winfrey on the show, with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Yohana Desta describing Wilson&#x27;s impression of Winfrey as &quot;the gold standard&quot; and &quot;HuffPost&quot;″s Pollo Del Mar writing that Wilson&#x27;s impressions of Winfrey and Houston were &quot;as iconic as they were scathing&quot;. Wilson went on to play Winfrey on the animated sitcom &quot;The Proud Family&quot; and in the 2006 parody film &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot;. Other frequent celebrity impressions included Sasso&#x27;s impressions of actors Robert De Niro and James Gandolfini, Lee&#x27;s impression of newscaster Connie Chung, and Frank Caliendo&#x27;s impressions of John Madden and George W. Bush.

== Release ==

=== Episodes ===


=== Broadcast and syndication ===
&quot;Mad TV&quot; was owned by Warner Bros. and broadcast every Saturday at 11 p.m. on Fox until its final episode in 2009. Reruns also aired on Fox during prime time starting in 1999. TNN aired reruns of the series after acquiring the nonexclusive cable TV rights to it in 2000, while Comedy Central acquired the rights to the show&#x27;s first nine seasons in 2004 and aired reruns until 2008.

=== Home media and streaming services ===
A DVD set of the first season of &quot;Mad TV&quot;, entitled &quot;Mad TV: The Complete First Season&quot;, was released in 2004 by Warner Bros. It includes a blooper reel, unaired sketches, and the show&#x27;s 200th episode from 2003. It was reviewed positively by Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, who said that it &quot;demonstrates that the show is frequently very funny, in its own subversive way.&quot; Warner Bros. also released a &quot;best of&quot; DVD for seasons eight, nine, and ten on October 25, 2005.

Episodes of the series were also made available to stream on The WB&#x27;s website, TheWB.com, after its launch in 2008, and on The CW&#x27;s streaming service, CW Seed, after the announcement of the show&#x27;s 2016 reboot. , the series was also available to stream on HBO Max.

==Reception==
===Viewership===
&quot;Mad TV&quot; was particularly popular among teenage viewers, who, according to Fox executives, watched the show more than &quot;SNL&quot; by 2001. Former cast members have stated that teenagers often made up the majority of the show&#x27;s studio audience. In 2000, 59 percent of &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s audience was between the ages of 18 and 49. By late 2003, &quot;Mad TV&quot; averaged 4.4 million viewers per week. Upon the series&#x27;s cancellation in 2008, the series was averaging 2.6 million viewers, which was a 6 percent decrease from the previous year.

===Critical reception===
In a review of &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s pilot, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; called &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;a corpse trying to reanimate itself&quot; while praising &quot;Mad TV&quot; as &quot;promising&quot;. Another review of &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s pilot in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; by James Endrst stated that &quot;Mad TV&quot; was &quot;only occasionally terrible&quot;. A review of the pilot episode by Tom Shales in &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mad TV&quot; was &quot;bad TV&quot;, criticizing it as tasteless and unintelligent. For &quot;People&quot;, Craig Tomashoff gave the pilot a C−, stating that it was &quot;pretending to be daring and irreverent&quot; despite being &quot;just unimaginative&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Mad TV&quot; was reviewed favorably by Steve Johnson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, who wrote that it &quot;looked consistently fresh, with more energy, imagination and edge [than &quot;SNL&quot;]&quot; and &quot;rewards the effort of tuning it in&quot;. Ginia Bellafante of &quot;Time&quot; also wrote in 1996 that &quot;it has steadily improved since its unpromising early episodes&quot;, but that many of its politically incorrect sketches were &quot;so heavy-handed&quot; that they were &quot;virtually unwatchable&quot;. After the end of the show&#x27;s fourth season, Terry Kelleher of &quot;People&quot; wrote that &quot;Mad TV&quot; was &quot;not a bad product&quot; but had a &quot;policy of putting recurring characters through the same tired paces&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Alynda Wheat was critical of the show&#x27;s finale, writing that &quot;maybe it was time for &quot;Mad TV&quot; to go&quot; due to &quot;how thin its material has grown&quot;.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s John Hugar called &quot;Mad TV&quot; &quot;eh&quot; with &quot;some memorable recurring characters&quot; such as Stuart that relied on &quot;excessively broad comedy&quot;. In 2016, Jesse Thorn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; retrospectively described &quot;Mad TV&quot; as &quot;long-running&quot; and &quot;critically maligned&quot;, and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Chris O&#x27;Connell wrote in 2010 that it was &quot;the worst sketch-comedy show on television&quot;. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;″s Julie Hinds wrote that the show &quot;wasn&#x27;t the most consistent vehicle&quot;, and that it &quot;sometimes went too far with a joke but could still crack you up regularly&quot;. Common Sense Media&#x27;s Lucy Maher gave the series three out of five stars, stating that it &quot;purposely pushes the limits of decency to the breaking point&quot; but that it had &quot;moments of brilliance&quot;. In a retrospective review of the show, Carleton Atwater of &quot;Vulture&quot; criticized it as &quot;so lazy and unambitious&quot; and wrote that it &quot;appeals to the lowest common denominator&quot;. Aisha Harris of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote that the show &quot;could so often be joke-writing at its laziest&quot;, but that it &quot;could also occasionally be very good and smart&quot; when it struck a balance between &quot;titillation, insight, and hilarity&quot;. For &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Zadie Smith wrote that &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s humor was &quot;broad—and too reliant on celebrity subjects&quot;.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comparisons===
&quot;Mad TV&quot; has frequently been compared to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Mad TV&quot; as a &quot;more cultish weekend cousin to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aimed squarely at teens&quot;, while the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;″s Julie Hinds called it &quot;a boisterous second cousin&quot; of &quot;SNL&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot;″s Aisha Harris called &quot;Mad TV&quot; &quot;a scrappy, less sophisticated cousin of SNL&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot; called &quot;Mad TV&quot; &quot;the young, scrappy upstart to &quot;SNL&quot;″s elder statesman brand of sketch comedy&quot;. Luke Winkie of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote that, despite not having the &quot;live kinetic energy&quot; or &quot;the all-star glitz&quot; of &quot;SNL&quot;, &quot;most children of the &#x27;90s have a special place in our hearts for &quot;MADtv&quot;&quot;. Terry Kelleher of &quot;People&quot; wrote, &quot;It would be easy to dismiss [&quot;Mad TV&quot;]... as the poor man&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. But basically &quot;Mad TV&quot; has everything &quot;SNL&quot; has—the virtues and the defects.&quot;

Cast and crew members later stated that &quot;Mad TV&quot; lacked the &quot;cool factor&quot; and &quot;hipness&quot; that &quot;SNL&quot; had, but noted that it instead appealed more to &quot;the average person&quot; and to middle-class people of color. Ginia Bellafante of &quot;Time&quot; wrote in 1996 that &quot;Mad TV&quot; had a &quot;more balanced cast&quot; than &quot;SNL&quot; and &quot;an edginess that Lorne Michaels&#x27; once revolutionary show has long lacked&quot;. Salzman stated that &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s racially diverse cast and &quot;urban sensibility&quot; set it apart from &quot;SNL&quot;. &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s former video researcher Asterios Kokkinos, who was fired in 2007 after helping to shut down a &quot;Mad TV&quot; shoot as part of the Writers Guild of America Strike, wrote for &quot;Paste&quot; that the show was &quot;a cheaper copy of [&quot;SNL&quot;]&quot; that &quot;nobody seemed to care about&quot;.

===Controversies===
Some celebrities and organizations have spoken out against parodies of themselves on &quot;Mad TV&quot;. Bobby Brown said in 2022 that the show&#x27;s parodies of him and Whitney Houston &quot;really offended&quot; him, while Rosie O&#x27;Donnell shared on her self-titled talk show that she was offended by the show&#x27;s parody of her, in which Borstein portrayed her as a closeted lesbian. In 2003, the United States Postal Service and the National Association of Letter Carriers both publicly called on all of their employees to protest &quot;Mad TV&quot; over a then-upcoming sketch about a group of gun-wielding postal workers arguing over who should be able to &quot;go postal&quot; first. The Postal Service&#x27;s then-vice president of public affairs, Azeezaly S. Jaffer, called the sketch &quot;ugly&quot;, &quot;untrue&quot;, and &quot;an insult to every man and woman in the Postal Service&quot;.

The show was also criticized by audiences and critics for relying on stereotypes. Borstein&#x27;s character Ms. Swan in particular has frequently been identified by journalists and by Asian activists such as Guy Aoki and Margaret Cho as an example of yellowface. The character was protested by Aoki&#x27;s organization Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA). In 2019, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s Elahe Izadi called Ms. Swan an example of &quot;the kind of &#x27;problematic&#x27; stuff TV networks used to air&quot; and edgy&#x27; comedy from the early aughts that more overtly trafficked in racial stereotypes&quot;. Candace Amos of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that Ms. Swan would &quot;both anger and delight fans&quot; and &quot;was often called out for being racist&quot;, and Lara Zarum of &quot;Flavorwire&quot; wrote that &quot;we&#x27;re all in agreement that Ms. Swan, the nail-salon-owning, squinty-eyed, walking Asian stereotype, is a problem&quot;. Nevertheless, the series identifies Ms. Swan as hailing from Kuvaria, the home of Santa Claus, while Borstein stated that her inspirations for the character were her Hungarian-Jewish grandmother, and Icelandic singer Björk.

&quot;Mad TV&quot; also featured two instances of blackface: one in which Bobby Lee plays George Foreman&#x27;s fictional half-Asian son, and another wherein Michael McDonald plays a magical busboy from a foreign island.

===Accolades===
Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; all placed &quot;Mad TV&quot; on their lists of the greatest sketch comedy TV series of all time, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writing that it was &quot;beholden to no one and often about as subtle as Artie Lange laughing at a fart&quot; and a &quot;ceaseless roast&quot;. The Black Spy and the White Spy from &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s animated &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; sketches were listed as two of the best TV spies of all time by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2014.

&quot;Mad TV&quot; was nominated for 43 Primetime Emmy Awards, all of which were for technical achievements, and won five of them. It won the Emmys for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series in 2001, for Outstanding Costumes for a Variety or Music Program in 2005 and in 2006, for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song &quot;A Wonderfully Normal Day&quot; in 2006, and for Non-Prosthetic Makeup for a Multi-Camera Series in 2009. In 2007, &quot;Mad TV&quot;″s Emmys campaign, VoteMadTV.com, allowed Emmys voters to view clips of the series online rather than being shipped DVD screeners in an attempt to be more eco-friendly. Anjelah Johnson was nominated for an ALMA Award for her performance on &quot;Mad TV&quot; in 2008.

==2016 reboot==
A reboot of &quot;Mad TV&quot;, which was produced by Telepictures, created by Salzman, and executive produced by him, John R. Montgomery, and Mark Teitelbaum, premiered on The CW on July 26, 2016. It ran for eight hour-long episodes on Tuesday nights and starred eight new cast members: Carlie Craig, Chelsea Davison, Jeremy D. Howard, Amir K, Lyric Lewis, Piotr Michael, Michelle Ortiz and Adam Ray. Cast members from the original series such as Sullivan, Sasso, Collins, Lee, Barinholtz, and Wilson, hosted. The reboot placed a greater emphasis on political comedy than its predecessor and included parodies of former U.S. Presidents such as then-candidate Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, the latter of whom had been spoofed in the original series several times during the late 1990s.

The reboot received mostly negative reviews from critics. Ray Rahman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that it was &quot;inconsistent and lack[ed] any urgency&quot; while &quot;fail[ing] to justify its existence&quot;, calling its humor &quot;not just lame, but also stale&quot;. Aisha Harris of &quot;Slate&quot; similarly wrote, &quot;In its new, blander incarnation, it’s hard to imagine why &quot;MadTV&quot; needs to exist at all.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jesse Schedeen gave the revival a score of 3.2 out of a 10, writing that it had a &quot;simplistic, toothless brand of humor&quot; and failed &quot;to recapture any of the show&#x27;s old spark&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s John Hugar gave the premiere a C− and wrote that &quot;the new &quot;Mad TV&quot; can&#x27;t help but seem like an off-brand version of the original, which was an off-brand &quot;SNL&quot; to begin with&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Brian Moylan praised the diversity of the new cast but wrote that it was mostly not funny, while Common Sense Media&#x27;s Melissa Camacho gave it three out of five stars and wrote, &quot;Fans of the original show will find it funny, but its irreverent humor isn&#x27;t for everyone.&quot;

==&quot;Madtv&quot; musical==
In 2017, there was development of a &quot;Madtv&quot; musical called &quot;The Mad Show&quot; that received a developmental production from Colorado&#x27;s Theatre Aspen and was featured in presentations at the Wheeler Opera House from September 12 to 16, 2017. The musical starred &quot;Madtv&quot; alumni like Nicole Parker and Lauren Pritchard.

<text>Jamie Charles Cann (28 June 1946 – 15 October 2001) was a British Labour Party politician who was the Leader of Ipswich Borough Council from 1979 to 1991, before being elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich at the 1992 general election, a seat he held until his death in 2001.

==Early and family life==
He was educated at Barton-upon-Humber Grammar School and Kesteven College of Education. He then became a primary school teacher, serving as deputy headmaster of Handford Hall Primary School in Ipswich from 1981 to 1992.

==Political career==
Cann voted against equalising the age of consent for same-sex relations. In 1998, he was fined £1,000, and disqualified from driving for eighteen months for drink driving.

Renowned as an MP with acerbic wit, he spent most of his time campaigning in the constituency. As leader of Ipswich Borough Council, he was noted as a reformer and helped make Ipswich a model local authority.

He died of liver disease, in October 2001, just four months after being re-elected at the 2001 general election, and following a spell in hospital in Cambridge. The subsequent by-election for Ipswich was held on 22 November and was retained for the Labour Party by the new candidate Chris Mole. A retirement home on the Ravenswood development in Ipswich was named in Cann&#x27;s honour following his death.

<text>America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos, also called America&#x27;s Funniest Videos (abbreviated as AFV), is an American video clip television series on ABC, based on the Japanese variety show &quot;Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan&quot; (1986–1992). The show features humorous homemade videos that are submitted by viewers. The most common videos feature unintentional physical comedy, pets or children and some staged pranks.

Originally airing as a special in 1989, it debuted as a regular weekly series in January 1990. The show was originally hosted by comedian Bob Saget for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget stepped down as host in 1997, John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes took over as co-hosts for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials (hosted by various actors and comedians such as D. L. Hughley, Richard Kind, Stuart Scott and Steve Carell, with Mike Kasem and Kerri Kasem hosting international versions), ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with Tom Bergeron taking over hosting duties; Bergeron is the longest-running host in the show&#x27;s history to date, staying on &quot;AFV&quot; for fifteen seasons until he stepped down in 2015. Alfonso Ribeiro has hosted the program since 2015.

On May 16, 2023, ABC renewed &quot;AFV&quot; for a 34th season which premiered on October 1 of the same year. On May 13, 2024, ABC renewed &quot;AFV&quot; for a 35th season, which premiered on September 29 of the same year.

==Premise==
&quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; is based on the 1986–1992 Tokyo Broadcasting System variety program &quot;Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen TV&quot; (also known as &quot;Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan&quot;), which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in video clips from their home movies; ABC, which holds a 50% ownership share in the program, pays a royalty fee to TBS Holdings, Inc. for the use of the format (although the original parent show is no longer in production). Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show&#x27;s official website, AFV.com; through its iOS or Android apps; on the show&#x27;s official Facebook fan page; or by sending them via mail to a Hollywood, California post-office box address. The majority of the video clips are short (5–30 seconds) and are mostly related to the host&#x27;s monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents and incidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past U.S. presidents), and practical jokes. As of 1989, the show&#x27;s production process featured a group of screeners viewing the submitted tapes and grading them on a 1–10 scale based on how humorous they were. The videos graded the highest were sent to the show&#x27;s producers, and then to Di Bona and another producer for final approval. Videos that feature staged accidents, people being seriously injured, the abuse of animals, or otherwise do not meet ABC network standards and practices are generally not accepted for broadcast.

Every week, the producers choose three videos to participate in a tournament that the studio audience will vote on. The first-place winner is awarded a $20,000 cash prize (previously $10,000 until Season 32), advancing to the semifinals and placed in the running for the $100,000 prize awarded during the middle and near the end of each season (each with their own corresponding eligibility period for the $10,000 winners selected from the block of episodes preceding each $100,000 prize telecast); the runner-up receives $6,000 (previously $3,000) and the third-place video receives $4,000 (previously $2,000). The winners of the $100,000 prize in the semifinals then advance to the grand finals, and will compete for a vacation prize package in the grand finals (starting in Season 12, and becoming an annual tradition starting in Season 15), supplied by DisneyParks, Disney Cruise Line, Adventures by Disney, or Disney Vacation Club, and the title of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Video&quot;. The program&#x27;s studio segments are taped in front of a studio audience (although the specials that aired in 1999 and 2000 only featured pre-recorded audience responses, and episodes taped towards the end of Season 30 through Season 32 featured a &quot;virtual&quot; audience presented on set monitors through video conferencing due to local and state crowd restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic). Audience members are asked to dress in &quot;business casual or nicer&quot;.

Show creator Vin Di Bona has produced three spin-off programs: &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; (1990–1994), &quot;World&#x27;s Funniest Videos&quot; (1996), and extension series &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: Animal Edition&quot; (2021–2022). In 2019, Di Bona also created an attempt at an adult-oriented spinoff, &quot;Videos After Dark&quot;, which was not picked up as a series but aired on ABC as a two-episode special. Di Bona also created &quot;Show Me the Funny&quot; (1998–1999, Fox Family Channel) and &quot;That&#x27;s Funny&quot; (2004–2006, syndication), two similar comedic home video series—both hosted by actor/comedian Rondell Sheridan, who succeeded original host Stephanie Miller on the former—that largely relied on repackaged clips from the video libraries of &quot;AFV&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;. Several local television stations, even those not affiliated with ABC, also developed special funny home video segments in their newscasts during the early 1990s, and or local spinoffs, inspired by the series. As noted in the closing credits of each episode, most of the videos have been edited for length due to time constraints. In addition, according to the contest plugs, family members (both immediate or relatives) of employees of Vin Di Bona Productions, ABC, Inc., its corporate parent The Walt Disney Company (and for the substantial majority of Saget&#x27;s hosting tenure, its legal predecessor, Capital Cities/ABC) and their related subsidiaries are ineligible for the show&#x27;s contests and prizes.

==Series overview==
==History==
===Development===
Series creator Vin Di Bona had previously developed a similar concept in &quot;Animal Crack-Ups&quot; (1987–1990), a celebrity game show that aired primarily as part of ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup and was based on the Japanese series &quot;Wakuwaku Dōbutsu Land&quot; (or “&quot;Waku Waku Animal World&quot;&quot;), a game in which contestants answered questions related to funny video clips involving animals (accompanied by narration that anthropomorphized the clips’ subjects). Di Bona—who decided to form his eponymous production company following his stint as a line producer on the first season (1985–1986) of the ABC action-adventure series &quot;MacGyver&quot;—partnered with former CBS News executive Joe Bellon, whose distribution company, Bellon Enterprises (founded after Bellon left CBS in 1985), at the time had been struggling in its efforts to sell the international rights to programming concepts—like &quot;Wakuwaku&quot;—based on shows originally aired by the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS). The two soon developed a pitch for an American version of &quot;Wakuwaku&quot;, using the licensed animal footage from the program, eventually selling it to ABC.

In the spring of 1989, while Di Bona and his then-wife, Gina, attended the Monte-Carlo Television Festival, the latter passed a booth for a distributor showcasing a segment from the TBS variety program &quot;Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen TV&quot; (or &quot;Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan&quot;), in which hosts Ken Shimura and Cha Kato presented and provided comedic narration over a package of funny caught-on-tape moments sent in by viewers; at the end of each show, audience members voted for their favorite clip among those featured. At Gina&#x27;s insistence, Di Bona contacted TBS about licensing the rights to the concept.

Di Bona, with Bellon&#x27;s assistance in acquiring the clips from TBS, put together a presentation reel featuring footage from the &quot;Gokigen TV&quot; home video segment; ABC executives, immediately after seeing the reel (Di Bona has claimed in interviews that the network decided to buy the proposed show four minutes into the pitch), decided to place an order for the concept that would become &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. However, the network intended for it to be a one-off special, unsure that a program showing other people&#x27;s home movies would work as a weekly series. Di Bona enlisted most of the staff from &quot;Animal Crack-Ups&quot;—including among others, writer Todd Thicke (whose older brother, actor/host/songwriter Alan Thicke, hosted &quot;Crack-Ups&quot; in addition to his starring role in the ABC sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;), producer Steve Paskay, creative consultant Gina Di Bona, coordinating producers Joe and (his son and business partner) Greg Bellon, and director Ron de Moraes—to work on the pilot special. Di Bona also borrowed the comedic narration style used in &quot;Gokigen TV&quot; and &quot;Wakuwaku&quot;, having the host provide voices to both humans and animals featured in the clips as well as exaggerated observational humor.

In the run-up to the special&#x27;s broadcast, during the fall of 1989, Vin Di Bona Productions took out ads in national magazines (such as &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;People&quot;) asking people to send in their home videos featuring funny or amazing moments. Around 1,800 tapes were submitted for inclusion in the pilot special.

John Ritter was Vin Di Bona&#x27;s first choice to host the program, but was unavailable (according to Di Bona, Ritter did not envision the hosting role as fitting in with his shifting career focus from sitcoms to feature films). Los Angeles sports reporter Fred Roggin was also approached to host, but due to his contract negotiations with NBC (and its O&amp;O station KNBC), he was unable to accept. (Roggin would eventually host a similar show of his own, &quot;Roggin&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which aired in syndication from 1991 to 1993.) Di Bona then approached actor/comedian Bob Saget (then starring as Danny Tanner in the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;), whom he remembered from the latter&#x27;s May 1989 guest appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, impressed by his comedic timing and storytelling during the interview; however, Di Bona was unaware of Saget&#x27;s existing ABC series role until he was informed by network executives when pitching Saget as host. Saget was initially reluctant to accept, but Di Bona ultimately convinced him to agree to do the gig, believing that it would showcase Saget&#x27;s general comedic talent, and make him known for that than merely for his role as the cleanliness-obsessed &quot;dorky dad&quot; on &quot;Full House&quot;.

=== 1989–1997: Bob Saget ===

The show debuted on November 26, 1989, as an hour-long special, produced by Di Bona and Steve Paskay, with Saget as host. Actress Kellie Martin, then the star of fellow ABC series &quot;Life Goes On&quot; (as Becca Thatcher), which would serve as the lead-in program to &quot;AFHV&quot; for the latter show&#x27;s first four seasons, and &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; (as the voice of Daphne Blake), served as a special guest and assisted Saget in hosting two segments during the special, including the announcement of the three grand prize finalists (for the special, the first-place winner was awarded a $5,000 cash prize, while the second and third-place winners each won an RCA camcorder). Married couple Helen and Bill Wholf of Thompson, Ohio were awarded the show&#x27;s first grand prize for a clip titled &quot;The Dishwasher Lady,&quot; in which Bill discovers Helen had gotten herself stuck inside their dishwasher after her hair became entangled in the machine&#x27;s spray arm while attempting to retrieve a dropped utensil. The clip, the Panasonic OmniMovie HQ 1FX8-CCD camcorder that Bill Wholf used to record the video, and other artifacts from the series—including an annotated pilot script, an audience voting machine, and a presentation reel created to pitch the proposed special to ABC executives—were donated to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History in 2008.
&quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; became an unexpected hit for ABC: the special&#x27;s initial broadcast was watched by 32.8 million viewers, roughly double the network&#x27;s average viewership in the Sunday 8:00 p.m. ET timeslot at the time. Ratings increased over the course of the show, with much of it coming from viewers in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. snowed in by a significant blizzard that hit those regions a few days earlier around the Thanksgiving holiday. Impressed by the viewer response to the special, ABC decided to turn it into a weekly prime time series and ordered 10 additional half-hour episodes (later increased to 15); it debuted as a regular series on January 14, 1990, serving as a replacement for the recently cancelled fantasy sitcom &quot;Free Spirit&quot;. Besides acting as host, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke (who stayed with the series until the 2014–15 season, and also served as a producer starting with its eighth season in 1996) and Bob Arnott.

Ernie Anderson, the longtime voice of ABC, was the program&#x27;s original announcer, although Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, then known mainly as the announcer for &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, occasionally substituted for him during some Season 1 episodes. Anderson also made an on-camera cameo appearance during the third season&#x27;s first grand prize episode, originally aired on November 17, 1991 (an excerpt from that episode—featuring Saget prodding Anderson into reciting the signature vocal delivery he used to promote &quot;The Love Boat&quot;—was featured during the March 9, 1997, episode in a brief segment paying tribute to Anderson, who died the previous month from lung cancer). He was replaced in 1995 by radio and television actor Gary Owens, who remained in that role until Saget&#x27;s departure, although Anderson would briefly return via archived recordings. The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Funny Things You Do&quot;, was performed by co-songwriter Jill Colucci (who also sung the themes for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Something&#x27;s Happening&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Watching&quot; promotional campaigns between 1987 and 1990) for most of the Saget run; this was replaced midway through Season 8 by a funk rock duet rendition by Peter Hix and Terry Wood. (Colucci would make a cameo appearance during the show&#x27;s second season to perform the song in the opening segment of the January 6, 1991 episode.) The set used throughout the Saget era was an open floorplan living room design (originally a papered three-wall design with a bay window for the first three seasons, then redesigned for the 1992–93 season as a translucent-walled flatter frame outline utilizing a similar floorplan, though the furniture from the original set remained), with two large video screens on either side of the main set.

Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget&#x27;s tenure as host of &quot;AFHV&quot;. The opening host segment of each episode was tied in with a skit featured in-between the transition from the opening title sequence and Saget&#x27;s introduction. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage, the setting within it changing each episode) pretending to get excited to watch the show. Sometimes, Saget would visit, attempt to interact with, and pretend to watch the show with the actors (with a pre-recording of Saget appearing on the TV set). These opening gags were scrapped after the fifth season. In Season 5, the show introduced an animated sidekick named &quot;Stretchy McGillicuddy&quot; (voiced by Danny Mann, and dropped after said season), who regularly teased Saget and did other bizarre things; one episode featured Stretchy—who often uttered the catchphrase, &quot;Don&#x27;t get a little touchy, Bob, I&#x27;m just a little stretchy!&quot;, in his appearances—appearing on the two large set monitors and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Saget ended each episode with the tagline, &quot;Keep those cameras safely rolling&quot;, followed by a message to his wife who was implied to be watching the show at home (the latter joke was phased out towards the end of the seventh season, in the midst of Saget&#x27;s deteriorating marital issues with first wife Sherri Kramer, whom he would divorce in 1997).

The success of &quot;AFHV&quot;—which regularly placed in the Nielsen Top 5 ratings during its first season (even temporarily unseating the CBS newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; as America&#x27;s most-watched network television series in March 1990), and finished in fifth place among all network programs for the 1989–90 season—quickly led ABC to order a pilot for a spin-off: &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest... Part II&quot; aired on May 13, 1990 as a half-hour special that was hosted by Saget&#x27;s &quot;Full House&quot; co-star, Dave Coulier (who played Joey Gladstone on the sitcom); as was the case with &quot;AFHV&quot; following its debut special, ABC immediately picked up &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest... Part II&quot; as a weekly series for its 1990–91 fall schedule. Retitled &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;, it debuted as a series on September 9, 1990, with actress/producer Arleen Sorkin joining Coulier as co-host. (Sorkin was replaced by model Tawny Kitaen for the show&#x27;s third and fourth seasons.) The series focused on videos featuring people &quot;intentionally&quot; trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.

For its first four seasons, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; aired on Sunday nights at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time; when the spin-off premiered in September 1990, &quot;AFHV&quot;—then entering its second season—was paired with &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; (following at 8:30 p.m.) to form an hour-long home video block. Beginning with their respective fifth and fourth seasons in September 1993, ABC made &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; the lead-off programs of its Sunday prime time lineup, moving them both an hour earlier (to 7:00 and 7:30 p.m., respectively) to replace &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, which ended its four-season run that May; this also gave both shows a formidable rival in &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which had regularly beaten its 7:00 competitors in the ratings since CBS permanently moved the newsmagazine to Sundays in 1975. In May 1994, ABC canceled &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; after four seasons due to declining ratings, and decided to put the freshman sitcom &quot;On Our Own&quot; (a co-production of Miller-Boyett Productions and Warner Bros. Television, both of which were also behind Saget&#x27;s other series, &quot;Full House&quot;) in its former timeslot for the 1994–95 fall schedule; after &quot;On Our Own&quot; was put on hiatus that December following an initial run of 13 episodes (it would return as part of the Friday TGIF comedy lineup in March 1995 to complete its abbreviated 20-episode season), the network chose to expand &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; to one hour with back-to-back episodes, with that week&#x27;s new episode occupying the first half-hour, followed by a repeat from a previous season to fill the remaining time.

On February 1, 1996, ABC debuted another spin-off of &quot;AFHV&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Funniest Videos&quot;; taped at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, this series—like &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot;—was also hosted by Coulier, alongside actress Eva LaRue (then playing on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; in the role of Dr. Maria Santos). Paired with a weekly version of the popular &quot;Before They Were Stars&quot; specials on Thursday nights, &quot;World&#x27;s Funniest Videos&quot; focused on funny and amazing home videos from around the world. However, due to low ratings, ABC put the series on hiatus a few weeks after its debut, before cancelling it outright after only one season and burning off the remaining episodes that summer. For Saget&#x27;s final season on &quot;AFHV&quot; (1996–97), two new episodes aired back-to-back for several weeks over the course of the season, which increased the episode order that year to 30.

Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget&#x27;s contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for &quot;AFV&quot; as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (longtime parent company Capital Cities/ABC had then recently completed the sale of its assets to current owner The Walt Disney Company). His former &quot;Full House&quot; castmates—except for Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen—appeared for the penultimate episode of Season 8 (airing on May 9, 1997, in a special Friday broadcast as part of ABC&#x27;s comedy-centered &quot;3D Week&quot; programming stunt), preceding Saget&#x27;s final episode as host, the season-ending $100,000 grand prize episode (aired in its regular slot on May 18). (The two final Saget episodes were rebroadcast on September 21, 1997, the day before production commenced on Season 9.)

Saget returned to &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; on three different occasions—first, to co-host a 20th anniversary special edition episode alongside then-host Tom Bergeron, which aired on November 29, 2009 (which was three days shy of &quot;AFV&quot;″s actual 20th anniversary date of its premiere on the air on November 26, 1989); a cameo appearance at the end of Bergeron&#x27;s final episode on May 17, 2015, where he was driving a golf cart and to co-host a 30th anniversary documentary special (&quot;AFV: America... This Is You!&quot;) alongside Bergeron and current host Ribeiro, which aired on December 8, 2019 (his last appearance prior to his death in early January 2022).

After Saget&#x27;s departure from the series, ABC sidelined &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; from the network&#x27;s 1997–98 fall schedule; in the late fall of 1997, ABC decided to put the series on its Monday lineup as a replacement for the TV adaptation of &quot;Timecop&quot;, which had been pulled from the schedule after five episodes due to persistently poor viewership. The first two episodes of the ninth season (the eighth and ninth to be taped in production order) aired as a &quot;sneak peek&quot; on November 21, 1997, as part of the &quot;TGIF&quot; lineup, before the remainder of the season began airing regularly in the show&#x27;s new Monday slot on January 5, 1998. This season featured new hosts, an overhauled look (including new full-title and abbreviated logos, which were later modified in Season 15 and partially overhauled in Season 26, and a new set augmented by a balcony-linked, double-flight bent staircase surrounding a large center-stage monitor, ditching the living room set-up used throughout the Saget era), and a new ska instrumental rendition of the &quot;Funny Things You Do&quot; theme song composed by Dan Slider (which remained in use for the 2000–01 specials and the entirety of Bergeron&#x27;s run as host as well as being featured in Alfonso Ribeiro&#x27;s 2015 hosting audition tape). The show began to be alternately called &quot;AFV&quot; at this point, with references to the abbreviated name being used in most on-air parlance going forward (though &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; remained the show&#x27;s official title).

Comedian John Fugelsang and model-turned-television personality Daisy Fuentes took over as co-hosts of the show. Three new writers—among them, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; alumni J. Elvis Weinstein and Trace Beaulieu—joined holdover scribe Thicke (assigned the newly created role of supervising writer) on the writing staff, replacing Saget and Arnott. Like Saget had done during his run in certain videos within clip packages, Fugelsang and Fuentes humorously narrated the clips shown (either observationally or by exaggerating certain circumstances leading to the comedic moment). Owens was succeeded by an unknown announcer, who was subsequently replaced for the tenth season by voice actor Jess Harnell, who still holds this position to this day. With ABC reserving the Sunday 7:00 p.m. ET slot for &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; beginning that season (ironically putting the anthology series—which returned to broadcast television after a six-year run on the Disney Channel—directly against Fox&#x27;s new &quot;AFV&quot;-inspired series &quot;The World&#x27;s Funniest!&quot;), the show changed timeslots several times over the next two seasons: after leading off ABC&#x27;s Monday night lineup (at 8:00 p.m. ET) for Season 9, the network moved &quot;AFV&quot; to Saturday nights at the start of Season 10 (1998–99); the show was later moved to Thursday nights in March 1999, opposite the first hour of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Must See TV&quot; comedy lineup and airing directly against the top-rated &quot;Friends&quot;.

Ratings for the show suffered during this period, due to both less-than-satisfactory reception to the new hosts and changes to the show&#x27;s format as well as the timeslot changes. Both Fuentes and Fugelsang left the show after two seasons in 1999. Their last original new episode—which aired on August 28, after a five-month delay (Season 10&#x27;s penultimate first-run episode had aired on April 29)—was taped at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California. Until the 2019 special &quot;AFV: America... This Is You!&quot;, showcasing footage from the tenures of the other AFV hosts, the only honorable mention of Fugelsang and Fuentes and segments showcasing their run was the two-part 300th episode &quot;AFV&quot; special in November 2003 (during the early years of the Bergeron run). While Fugelsang has not been seen in new recent never-before-seen footage on the road or in-studio on &quot;AFV&quot; since his and Fuentes’ departure, Fuentes was featured in interview segments discussing their time on the show for &quot;America... This Is You!&quot;, while both Fugelsang and Fuentes conducted further interviews for the &quot;America... This Is You!&quot; podcast.

===1999–2000: Specials===
In May 1999, ABC announced that it would discontinue &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; as a regular weekly series after its tenth season, but allowed the format to continue as a series of thematic specials hosted by various personalities, including ABC sitcom stars D. L. Hughley (of &quot;The Hughleys&quot;) and Richard Kind (of &quot;Spin City&quot;), and future &quot;AFV&quot; host Tom Bergeron. Concurrently, Vin di Bona Productions produced a season intended for selected international markets, with Kerri and Mike Kasem (both children of legendary radio DJ and voice actor Casey Kasem) as hosts. The show moved to a much smaller soundstage on a set that featured various video screens and monitors (resembling iMac computers) placed on shelves.

A home video-exclusive special, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: Deluxe Uncensored&quot;, was released on VHS and DVD in July 1999; hosted by Steve Carell and taped on the set used for the ninth and tenth seasons of the original series run, it featured somewhat more risqué content than that allowed on the television broadcasts (in a format similar to the 2019 &quot;Videos After Dark&quot; specials). A sports-themed special, &quot;AFV: The Sports Edition&quot;, hosted by ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, would later air on ABC in 2006 and was rebroadcast every New Year&#x27;s Day along with occasional broadcasts before NBA playoff games (with a post 8:30 p.m. ET) tip-off until 2008. These specials (except for the special sports edition) were not taped in front of a live studio audience, with pre-recorded applause and laugh tracks were used during commercial bumpers and just before, during, and after video packages being used instead.

===2001–2015: Tom Bergeron===
In October 2000, ABC announced that &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; would return as a regular weekly series, ordering an eleventh season consisting of 13 episodes. On February 3, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron (who was also hosting the syndicated &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; at the time) serving as host. Episodes were expanded to a full hour (instead of the back-to-back half-hour episodic structure used from 1995 to 1999), and aired on Friday nights at 8:00 p.m. ET; however, it went on hiatus for two months during the 2001-02 season due in part to the September 11 attacks and also because of ABC&#x27;s decision to fill the Friday lineup with specials and a new, but short-lived lineup of reality and drama series (&quot;The Mole II: The Next Betrayal&quot;, &quot;Thieves&quot; and &quot;Once and Again&quot;, of which &quot;Thieves&quot; was cancelled after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired); &quot;AFV&quot; returned to the schedule (via reruns of the previous season) in December 2001, and began its twelfth season as a midseason replacement in February 2002. A new set (with a studio audience) was introduced—featuring a pillar with several monitors—when Bergeron&#x27;s first season began.

With ABC moving &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; to Saturdays for the 2003-04 season, in September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00 p.m. Eastern timeslot, still in its hour-long format (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend comedic voiceovers similar to Saget&#x27;s style to some clips from time to time during the eleventh season. Changes to the set for that season included the replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, the pillars being recolored to blue (sometimes other colors), the addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, and lights under the center stage with return of the abbreviated &quot;AFV” logo.

For Season 18 (2007–08), the series began allowing viewers to upload their video submissions online at ABC.com; it would later direct viewers to submit their videos to a new standalone website, AFV.com, beginning with Season 23 (2012–13), in addition to the existing practice of submitting videos via standard mail. In Season 22 (2011–12), &quot;AFV&quot; released an iOS app on the App Store, allowing Apple mobile device users to record and directly upload videos for submission to the show; a version for Android devices was released the following season.

The final six seasons of Bergeron&#x27;s run as host fell during two major milestones in the series’ history. In 2009, in commemoration of its 20th season, the show started its &quot;Funny Since 1989&quot; campaign and broadcast a special 20th anniversary episode on November 29, featuring a guest appearance by Saget in his return to &quot;AFV&quot; for the first time since his 1997 departure. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; lightsaber fight scenes during the closing credits (Disney, owner of show co-producer ABC Entertainment and its namesake network, would coincidentally later acquire the franchise through its 2011 purchase of Lucasfilm), with the design of the pinatas resembling the two hosts.

On March 7, 2014, Bergeron announced on his Twitter account that he would step down as host of &quot;AFV&quot; at the conclusion of its 25th season. The series commemorated its silver anniversary for its 2014–15 season, and broadcast a 25th Anniversary Celebrity Celebration special on February 15, 2015, in which Bergeron and ABC sitcom stars Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross (both co-leads of &quot;Black-ish&quot;) and Cristela Alonzo (of &quot;Cristela&quot;) recounted memorable videos from the show&#x27;s history, with one of three nominees from the pool being awarded a Disney Cruise Line vacation grand prize. Bergeron&#x27;s penultimate episode (the last episode he hosted from the show&#x27;s soundstage and the final (and season 25&#x27;s second) $100,000 show of his tenure) aired on May 10, 2015, incorporating periodic montages of funny home videos that defined the show&#x27;s then-25-year run. His final episode as host, which was also the 25th season finale, aired the following week on May 17; taped on-location at Disneyland for that season&#x27;s edition of the annual &quot;Grand Prize Spectacular” (which utilized various formats since 2005, and featured one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season winning a Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, or in earlier seasons, an Adventures by Disney vacation package), &quot;AFV&quot;″s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort&#x27;s 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration (which began on May 22, 2015) featured an auto-tuned montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron&#x27;s run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near Sleeping Beauty Castle following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special cameo appearance. (Bergeron&#x27;s 15-year run is the longest hosting tenure for the series to date.)

Bergeron would later make an in-studio guest appearance alongside his successor, Alfonso Ribeiro, in the Season 26 &quot;Grand Prize Spectacular&quot; finale (aired on May 22, 2016), in which he played the show&#x27;s final audience participation game segment (&quot;Who Breaks It?&quot;) and won an Ribiero &quot;AFV&quot; pillow and socks. He was featured alongside fellow hosts Ribeiro, Saget and Fuentes in the 2019 special &quot;AFV: America...This Is You!&quot;.

===2015–present: Alfonso Ribeiro===
On May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron&#x27;s final episode aired, ABC announced that Alfonso Ribeiro (known for his role as Carlton Banks on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;) would take over as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; starting with its 26th season (premiering on October 11 of that year). Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro&#x27;s new role as host during the latter&#x27;s guest performance on the 20th season finale of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. (Ribeiro competed during and won the previous season; coincidentally, as Bergeron had done from the dance competition series’ 2005 debut until his 2015 departure from &quot;AFV&quot;, Ribeiro would later begin co-hosting &quot;DWTS&quot;, in addition to his existing &quot;AFV&quot; duties, in 2022.) Prior to becoming host, Ribeiro appeared on the show&#x27;s March 8, 2015 episode playing an audience participation game (called &quot;Who&#x27;s Makin&#x27; That Racket?&quot;) alongside then-host Bergeron.
Ribeiro continued Bergeron&#x27;s concept of humorously narrating clips, sometimes making extensive use of rhymes in his voiceovers. While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued into the first five years of Ribeiro&#x27;s hosting tenure, the stage was updated to feature a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a puzzle-style cube screen composed of smaller sized flat-panel TV screens, while new segments (developed especially for Ribiero&#x27;s run) were incorporated into the show. Audience participation games introduced during the Bergeron era were eliminated for the 27th season (2016–17). Additional set props such as arrow-styled flat-panel monitors and lit color-changing tables (where selected audience members not assigned to the bleacher areas sit) were added to the &quot;AFV&quot; set in 2019.

For its 28th season (premiering on October 8, 2017), &quot;AFV&quot; was displaced from its longtime 7:00 p.m. ET slot to make room for the reality competition series &quot;The Toy Box&quot; (which was in its second and final season), resulting in the former being moved to 8:00 p.m. ET. Periodically over the course of three months (between November 26, 2017 and February 4, 2018), the show employed a “repeat/new” episode scheduling format similar to that employed during the later Saget and Fugelsang/Fuentes eras, with new episodes in the 7:00 p.m. hour (occasionally reduced to a single hour block due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing in 8:00 p.m. slot during the holiday season), before permanently returning to the earlier slot on February 11, 2018. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed &quot;AFV&quot; for two more seasons, extending the series for its 30th and 31st seasons (premiering on September 29, 2019 and October 18, 2020, respectively). On December 8, 2019 (following a new episode in its regular slot), ABC broadcast &quot;AFV: America, This is You!&quot;, a retrospective documentary commemorating &quot;AFV&quot;″s 30th anniversary; the special featured appearances by creator/executive producer Vin di Bona and four of the five hosts—Ribeiro, Saget (in his final &quot;AFV&quot; appearance before his death in January 2022), Fuentes and Bergeron—and chronicled the show&#x27;s development and pop culture status.

Production was suspended before the completion of the 30th season due to the COVID-19 pandemic; in lieu of its standard “grand prize” season finale format, a quarantine themed special, &quot;AFV@Home&quot;, aired on May 17, 2020; similar in concept to CBS&#x27;s &quot;AFV&quot;-styled &quot;The Greatest AtHome Videos&quot; (which aired its initial special two days prior) and incorporating hosted segments recorded at Ribeiro&#x27;s Los Angeles home, the special featured humorous videos submitted to the program and culled from various social media platforms that were filmed mainly during stay-at-home isolation. The series returned to the studio for its 31st season (which premiered on October 18, 2020), however, studio segments utilized a virtual audience—a concept first used for the last three episodes of season 30 prior to the in-studio production shutdown—to comply with federal social distancing guidelines, consisting of audience members appearing and interviews with the grand prize nominees being conducted via videotelephony on the various set monitors. On June 11, 2021, the fourth offshoot of the franchise, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos: Animal Edition&quot;, premiered on Nat Geo Wild (which ABC acquired through its 2019 purchase of most of 21st Century Fox’s assets).

On January 9, 2022, during the 32nd season (which premiered on October 3, 2021), original host Bob Saget was found dead in his room at a Ritz Carlton hotel near Williamsburg, Florida, a day after his stand-up comedy performance in nearby Orlando. (Saget&#x27;s passing was announced during an ABC News special report that interrupted the end of a new episode airing that night.) The show paid tribute to him in the January 16, 2022 episode, which opened with a dedication to Saget by Alfonso Ribeiro, clips of Saget&#x27;s tenure as host, and a brief discussion between him and Bergeron from the 2009 20th anniversary special, along with a standard pre-credits dedication; a tribute segment featuring clips from the Saget era was featured in subsequent episodes for the remainder of Season 32. After two years of using a virtual audience, the 33rd season (which debuted on October 2, 2022) returned to using an in-person studio audience, although nominees for the weekly grand prize contest would continue to appear via remote; the cash amounts for the videos selected for the weekly prize contest were also increased for the first time since &quot;AFV&quot;s series debut, doubling the first place prize to $20,000 (from $10,000), second place to $6,000 (from $3,000), and third place to $4,000 (from $2,000). For Season 34, in addition to standard hour-long episodes in the show&#x27;s regular timeslot, ABC aired edited half-hour versions of &quot;AFV&quot; episodes from the previous season on selected Sundays during the early fall to fill airtime following &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; film presentations scheduled to end prior to the conclusion of the network&#x27;s Sunday lineup. (Although Ribeiro is a SAG-AFTRA member—being exempted from the strike under the separate Network Television Code contract—and co-executive producer/head writer Mike Palleschi and co-writer Erik Lohla are WGA members, the series was not affected by the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes, the latter having ended four days before Season 34&#x27;s October 1, 2023 premiere.)

==Seasonal contests==
===$100,000 show===
After every half of the season, the winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000 in the semifinals. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12–14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season&#x27;s final episode), though only one aired in the first and eleventh season. This format was used until 2002. Due to COVID-19, the 2020 season did not feature the traditional confetti, streamers, or live audience (although the virtual audience is shown instead; however a small amount of the live audience, now sitting in tables and not voting for the winner, and finalists standing up on the stage in a rock stone and gate, returned in Season 33), and the winner was chosen by remote video chat (the top three $20,000 winners in the $100,000 show, and the two $100,000 winners in the Grand Prize Spectacular are allowed to appear on stage in Season 33).

====Voting====
*1989–1997 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1989 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).
*1997–present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:
# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.
# Viewers log onto the show&#x27;s website to cast their votes.
# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 or the grand prize winning clip.

===Grand Prize Spectacular===
Beginning in Season 15, at the end of each season, the $100,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a grand prize contest in the grand finals to determine which video earns the title of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Video&quot;, serving as the season finale (except in Seasons 16 and 20, in which it is the episode before the finale). Starting in Season 17, it became known as the &quot;Grand Prize Spectacular&quot;.

==Ratings==
===Season averages===
&quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week. When it debuted as a weekly Sunday night series in January 1990, the show averaged an 18.0 rating/27 share, finishing at 16th place. It placed within Nielsen&#x27;s Top 5 highest-rated weekly series within weeks of its debut; by March 1990, &quot;AFHV&quot; became the No. 1 primetime series for a short time. &quot;AFHV&quot; finished the 1989–90 season in the Top 10 most watched shows, with an approximate average of 38 million viewers for each episode. &quot;AFHV&quot; finished the 2009–10 season in 55th place, with an approximate average of 7.52 million viewers, and finished in 69th in viewers 18–49, with 2.0/6. In 2016, a study by &quot;The New York Times&quot; of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that &quot;if you could pick a safe show that appeals to almost everyone, this might be it&quot;.

==Broadcast format==

Beginning with the show&#x27;s 21st-season premiere on October 3, 2010, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; began broadcasting in high definition. Many viewer-submitted videos were recorded in standard definition and were subsequently stretched horizontally to fit 16:9 screens. Since the 2012–13 season, videos recorded in 4:3 standard definition are carried in their original format with side pillarboxing. This continued to be the case for videos recorded on mobile devices recorded at a vertical angle. Since the conversion to HD, the series features advisories to viewers to tilt their mobile devices horizontally when recording in order for clip submissions to fit 16:9 screens without reformatting.

In 2014, all Tom Bergeron era episodes of the show originally produced in standard definition were remastered for widescreen and high definition broadcast compatibility, which involved cropping and stretching, with certain parts, such as the end credits switching to its original 4:3 aspect ratio after the first few seconds, and production logos, remaining in its original 4:3 aspect ratio. Video clips recorded in standard definition and airing since the show began broadcasting in high definition are also reformatted and stretched for widescreen compatibility.

==Syndication==
Repeats of the show began airing in broadcast syndication in September 1995.

The initial off-network syndication package consisted of the entirety of seasons 1-5, and the first 12 episodes of season 6, and was distributed by MTM Enterprises. This package aired on various local channels, TBS from October 2, 1995 – 1998, and USA Network from 1998 to 2001. 20th Television then assumed syndication rights from their purchase of MTM Enterprises in 1997, and continued on with the initial package, and issuing a new package with the remainder of seasons 6 through 8. Hallmark Channel notably aired both packages from August 5, 2001 to 2002, and various other channels carried the new package as well, but most stuck to the initial 5 1/2 season deal. Seasons 6–8 aired on ABC Family (now Freeform) from January 2002 to October 2007, usually on Tuesday through Saturday mornings, and occasionally on Sunday nights if a movie was not shown, being the last to air said seasons. After 2001, Buena Vista Television began distributing the show, and with it came two revamped packages: seasons 1-5 and 6-8. The first 5 seasons aired among networks such as PAX TV (now Ion Television) every Monday through Thursday night (later Monday through Friday night) from October 6, 2003 to April 11, 2005, and Nick at Nite for a short time from April 30 to October 12, 2007. The Saget era continued in local syndication for some time, finally ending up again on Hallmark Channel beginning on January 4, 2010. They were due to air all 8 seasons of the Saget run, but due to constantly changing timeslots, they never got past the tail end of season 5. The Saget era ceased its syndication run on February 25, 2010. Internationally, all 8 seasons aired on DTV in Russia, TVB Pearl in Hong Kong, and the 5 season package aired on networks including Omni 2, Sun TV, Omni British Columbia and TVTropolis in Canada.

The John and Daisy seasons (seasons 9-10) aired on WGN America (now NewsNation) from 2006 to 2014. The guest specials from the 1999-2001 period are known to have been syndicated on WGN as well. Both eras were never offered in off-network syndication, and the foreign market Kasem season was not syndicated abroad. Internationally, all 3 eras aired on various networks, including the Kasem season on TVNorge, and the John/Daisy seasons on DTV in Russia.

The Tom Bergeron seasons began airing on both WGN and ABC Family in fall 2004, with seasons 15-19 gradually being added to syndication as they completed their original runs on ABC. WGN continuing its run until 2018, and ABC Family replacing the Saget run with the Bergeron run in October 2007, airing it until 2014 on Tuesday through Saturday mornings, and occasionally on Sunday nights if a movie was not shown. Disney-ABC Domestic Television (the successor of Buena Vista Television) began offering seasons 11-19 in off-network syndication in 2009, airing on select Fox, MyNetworkTV, The CW, and various independent stations until 2013. Various local stations replaced the Saget run with this run as well. In 2014, after the introduction of the widescreen remasters, a new packaged was introduced, with all 15 seasons of the Bergeron run. WGN aired seasons 11-19 from this package, TBS began reairing the show with seasons 18-23 and 25 from 2014-2017, and UPtv then picked up seasons 20-25 in 2016, with its last airing on December 31, 2019, marking the end of the Bergeron years in syndication. Internationally, hour long episodes in the USA and Canada are split into two half hour parts, with a new opener and closing taped for each part. All references to the show being an hour long are also edited out. This practice continues into the Ribeiro years. This era has aired among networks such as RTL Klub in Hungary, TVB Pearl in Hong Kong, DTV in Russia, and it currently airs on PRVA Plus in Serbia, along with the Ribeiro era. In Canada, seasons 11–25 aired on ABC Spark, CMT, DejaView, YTV and Yes TV in some capacity until 2022. Since September 16, 2023, reruns of seasons 11-15 are now being shown on GameTV.

The Alfonso Ribeiro seasons (seasons 26–31) began airing on TeenNick on September 12, 2022, and finished airing in April 2023. The series returned to its schedule on November 20, 2023. The series returned to Nick At Nite on February 13, 2024, starting with season 31. This era aired internationally on TVB Pearl, and currently airs on PRVA Plus in Serbia, along with the Bergeron years.

Generally, a few to most &quot;AFV&quot; episodes from seasons 11-25 are available on Disney+ and Hulu, i.e., the Bergeron run in its remastered form, with availability varying at random based on platform&#x27;s publishing decisions.

<text>Entertainment! is the debut album by English post-punk band Gang of Four. It was released in September 1979 through EMI Records internationally and Warner Bros. Records in North America. Stylistically, it draws heavily on punk rock but also incorporates the influence of funk, reggae and dub. Its lyrics and artwork reflected the band&#x27;s left-wing political concerns. &quot;Entertainment!&quot; became a seminal album in the post-punk movement.

In 2020, &quot;Entertainment!&quot; was ranked at number 273 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Composition==
&quot;Entertainment!&quot; has been recognised as a seminal post-punk album, and an example of dance-punk, art punk and funk-punk. The album was co-produced by Jon King and Andy Gill along with Rob Warr, the band&#x27;s manager at the time. King&#x27;s lyrics were heavily influenced by Situationism, the work of philosophers Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan, feminism, and Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation; a unifying notion is that &quot;the personal is political&quot;. Topics include commodification (&quot;Natural&#x27;s Not in It&quot;, &quot;Return the Gift&quot;), proletarian life (&quot;At Home He&#x27;s a Tourist&quot;), great man theory (&quot;Not Great Men&quot;), the treatment of Special Category Status prisoners at Long Kesh during The Troubles (&quot;Ether&quot;), and the impact of media reporting on acts of terrorism and Maoist guerrilla warfare in Latin America (&quot;5.45&quot;). A number of songs apply these themes to subvert love song tropes, challenging traditional concepts of love (&quot;Anthrax&quot;, &quot;Contract&quot;) and sex (&quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, &quot;I Found That Essence Rare&quot;). In his 2014 monograph on the album, Kevin J. H. Dettmar likens the album to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, saying: &quot;both are concerned with the importance of narrative, of storytelling, as a mode of experiencing the world... that the stories we tell ourselves about &quot;the way things are&quot;—a body of stories that in another context we might call ideology—profoundly shape our experiences of the world.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover artwork, designed by King, shows the influence of the Situationist International, a left-wing organization which became famous for inspiring the events of May 68 in France. It depicts an &quot;Indian&quot; shaking hands with a &quot;cowboy&quot; in three heavily processed versions of the same image, based on a still from one of the Winnetou films starring Lex Barker and Pierre Brice, which had once been popular in East Germany as narratives critical of capitalism. Their faces are reduced to blobs of red and white: that is, to their stereotypical skin colours. A text that winds around the images reads: &quot;The Indian smiles, he thinks that the cowboy is his friend. The cowboy smiles, he is glad the Indian is fooled. Now he can exploit him.&quot; In this way, it approaches themes of exploitation, but may also criticize simplistic popular depictions of ethnic, social or political conflicts as &quot;cowboys and Indians&quot;.

The album&#x27;s back cover depicts a family whose father says, &quot;I spend most of our money on myself so that I can stay fat&quot;, while the mother and children declare, &quot;We&#x27;re grateful for his leftovers&quot;. On the album&#x27;s inner sleeve, designed by Gill, small photographs depicting scenes shown on television are interlaced with text illustrating what the band suggests are the misleading subtexts of media presentation: &quot;The facts are presented neutrally so that the public can make up its own mind&quot;; &quot;Men act heroically to defend their country&quot;; &quot;People are given what they want&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;At Home He&#x27;s a Tourist&quot; reached number 58 in the UK Singles Chart, the highest position of any Gang of Four song. The band were originally asked to perform the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. However, when the show&#x27;s producers heard the line &quot;And the rubbers you hide in your top left pocket&quot; they asked the group to change the word &quot;rubbers&quot; to &quot;rubbish&quot; for fear of causing offence; the band refused, and the appearance was cancelled.

In 2005, the band performed the album live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back concert series. In 2009, King wrote a track-by-track commentary on the album for &quot;Clash&quot;. Hugo Burnham&#x27;s memories of making the album were published in 2014, on the 35th anniversary of its release.

==Reception==
&quot;Entertainment!&quot; was ranked the fifth best album of 1979 by &quot;NME&quot;. Reviewing the album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1980, David Fricke regarded &quot;Entertainment!&quot; as &quot;the best debut album by a British band – punk or otherwise – since the original English release of &quot;The Clash&quot; in 1977&quot;. &quot;Creem&quot;″s RJ Smith, looking back on &quot;Entertainment!&quot; in 1984, found it to be &quot;the most difficult Gang album, because it&#x27;s so damn hard to find the front door to the thing. The ugly emotions &quot;Entertainment!&quot; dredges up are almost freakish, and all the more unsettling for the way they poke unexpectedly through the record&#x27;s detached, architectonic front.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;Entertainment!&quot; as the eighth best album of the 1970s. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 490 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, raising the album&#x27;s rank to number 483 in their 2012 update of the list, saying that its &quot;stiff, jerky aggression... invented a new style that influenced bands from the Minutemen to LCD Soundsystem&quot;. In their 2020 reboot of the list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 273. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; placed the track &quot;At Home He&#x27;s a Tourist&quot; at number 52 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Tracks&quot;. As of 2009, &quot;Entertainment!&quot; has sold more than 100,000 copies in the UK. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

The album has also attracted praise from rock musicians. Kurt Cobain of Nirvana listed it as one of his 50 favourite albums of all time. Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers stated that the first time he heard the record, &quot;It completely changed the way [he] looked at rock music and sent [him] on [his] trip as a bass player.&quot; Michael Stipe of R.E.M. has stated, &quot;Gang of Four could really swing. I stole a lot from them.&quot;

== Use in other media ==
&quot;Natural&#x27;s Not in It&quot; plays over the title sequence of the 2006 film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;. In 2010, Microsoft used it in advertisements for the Kinect.

&quot;Anthrax&quot; was used in the 2004 remake of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; and in the 1986 film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;, which featured Michael Hutchence in the lead role; Hutchence cited Gang of Four as a major influence on his band INXS. In 2016, Frank Ocean would sample the song on &quot;Futura Free&quot; from the album &quot;Blonde&quot;.

In 2014, Kevin J. H. Dettmar wrote a monograph on the album for Bloomsbury&#x27;s 33⅓ series.

<text>Menzoberranzan, the &quot;City of Spiders&quot;, is a fictional city-state in the world of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting. The city is located in the Upper Northdark, about two miles below the Surbrin Vale, between the Moonwood and the Frost Hills (north of the Evermoors and under the River Surbin). It is famed as the birthplace of Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, the protagonist of several series of best-selling novels by noted fantasy author R. A. Salvatore. Menzoberranzan has been developed into a video game (of the same name) and a tabletop RPG setting.

== Creative origins ==
In 1988, the character Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden was created by author R. A. Salvatore as a supporting character in the &quot;Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot; and referenced the character&#x27;s &quot;years in Menzoberranzan&quot;. The prequel series, &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot;, features the origin of Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden and the main setting is his home city of Menzoberranzan. Salvatore went through old &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure modules, such as &quot;Descent to the Depths of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Vault of the Drow&quot;, and &quot;Queen of the Demon Web Pits&quot;, for references on the Drow but the Drow were not defined outside of a matriarchal society in the Underdark. Salvatore was given carte blanche to create the entire society within the city. Mario Puzo&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; and the Five Families of New York greatly influenced Salvatore when he created the &quot;super-structure&quot; of the city and helped him create a &quot;logical consistency&quot; for the society.

In 2018, Salvatore said:Look, I grew up in a sexist, racist society. I grew up in an Italian neighborhood. Have you ever watched &quot;The Sopranos&quot;? That was my neighborhood. Only without the mob, but that was my neighborhood. It had the same attitudes about life. I grew up with five older sisters, and I saw what they had to endure. And they&#x27;re also where I got the idea for the bad matriarchal society of Menzoberranzan. [...] I love my sisters dearly. It&#x27;s funny, because they&#x27;ll always come up to me and say, &quot;I&#x27;m Vierna, right?&quot;

==Publication history==
=== &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; novels ===
==== &quot;The Icewind Dale&quot; trilogy ====
Menzoberranzan was introduced in &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (1988) as part of the background for Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden. Shannon Appelcline (author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;) wrote that &quot;from the time of that first book of Salvatore&#x27;s &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; trilogy, Drizzt was a breakout success, due in no small part to his mysterious origins and his &#x27;years in Menzoberranzan, or in the wilds of the Underdark . . .&#x27; With that one sentence, Salvatore ensured that the Underdark would rise up to unseat Deepearth as the collective name for D&amp;D&#x27;s underground realms—and that fans would want to know more about those realms&quot;.

==== &quot;The Dark Elf&quot; trilogy ====
In September 1990, Salvatore&#x27;s novel &quot;Homeland&quot; was released. This was the first novel in the prequel series and was followed by &quot;Exile&quot;, in December 1990, and then &quot;Sojurn&quot;, in May 1991. &quot;Homeland&quot; shows the life and society of Menzoberranzan as Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden grows up there. It explores the complex Drow house system in Menzoberranzan along with education system, called the Academy. Cindy Speer, for the &quot;SF Site&quot;, wrote that &quot;the city is beautifully rendered, a place of danger, as beautiful as a poisonous snake, and the rules of this society are chilling&quot;.

&quot;Pornokitsch&quot;, in their review of &quot;Homeland&quot;, wrote that &quot;Menzoberranzan is a stunning metropolis - svelte architecture, omnipresent magic and an atmosphere of choking paranoia. [...] It is important to note that the Forgotten Realms are a place of &quot;extremely&quot; high fantasy [...]. Menzoberranzan is high fantasy to another order of magnitude. Every drow can use magic and their city glows with eldritch power&quot;.

While at the end of &quot;Homeland&quot; Drizzt leaves Menzoberranzan, the city continues to be a secondary location in the trilogy and follows other characters still in the city.

==== &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; series ====
The &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; series, by R. A. Salvatore, was written after the Dark Elf trilogy but chronologically it follows the &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; trilogy. Menzoberranzan is a secondary location in the first novel, &quot;The Legacy&quot; (1992) and a major location in the second and third novels, &quot;Starless Night&quot; (1993) and &quot;Siege of Darkness&quot; (1994). In &quot;The Legacy&quot;, this &quot;is the first time Salvatore has &#x27;gone home&#x27; so to speak since Drizzt left the Underdark at the end of Exile. [...] The chaotic city of Menzoberranzan hosts part of the story with the unexpected return of a member (or two) of the Do&#x27;Urden family. This is the catalyst for the hunt for the blasphemous Ranger who turned his back on his family, race and the Spider Queen&quot;.

In &quot;Starless Night&quot;, Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to try to prevent an attack on Mithral Hall. In &quot;Siege of Darkness&quot;, while Menzoberranzan is heavily impacted by the Time of Troubles and magic going awry, the Drow still plan and then launch an attack on Mithral Hall.

====&quot;Starlight and Shadows&quot; trilogy ====
In September 1995, Elaine Cunningham&#x27;s novel &quot;Daughter of the Drow&quot; was released and it is set 21 years after Salvatore&#x27;s novel &quot;Sojurn&quot;. Unlike Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, the main character Liriel Baenre is prized member of the top house in Menzoberranzan. Similarly to &quot;Homeland&quot;, it follows Liriel Baenre&#x27;s early life and her process of escaping the city.

Menzoberranzan continues to be a secondary location in the rest of the trilogy, &quot;Tangled Webs&quot; (April 1996) and &quot;Windwalker&quot; (April 2003).

==== &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series ====
Menzoberranzan appears prominently in the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series, particularly as the setting of the first novel in the series &quot;Dissolution&quot; (2002), as well as &quot;Condemnation&quot; (2003), &quot;Extinction&quot; (2004), &quot;Annihilation&quot; (2004), and &quot;Resurrection&quot; (2005). The &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series is written by six authors with two editors; Philip Athans and R. A. Salvatore. The series &quot;returns to Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden&#x27;s homeland, the Underdark, to spin a tale of a ragged band of four dark elves on a desperate quest to find , drow goddess and the demon Queen of Spiders, and save their subterranean city of Menzoberranzan and the entire dark elf race&quot;.

==== &quot;Neverwinter Saga&quot; ====
Menzoberranzan appears as a secondary location in &quot;Charon&#x27;s Claw&quot; (2012), the third novel of the &quot;Neverwinter Saga&quot;, where &quot;at the beginning of the book, the Drow from Menzoberranzan are plotting to take Gauntylgyrm and the ancient fire being under their own power and have sent out forces to do just that&quot;. The release of this book was part of the Wizards of the Coast coordinated marketing campaign called &quot;Rise of the Underdark&quot;. A few weeks after &quot;Charon&#x27;s Claw&quot; was published, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; sourcebook on the city (&quot;&quot;) was also released as part of this campaign.

Salvatore said he came to understand that Artemis Entreri, a main character in the book, &quot;was who Drizzt might have become had he remained in Menzoberranzan. Entreri sees the surface world as wretched and evil as Drizzt viewed his homeland, except for Entreri, there was no escape. So he gave in to cynicism and hopelessness&quot;.

==== &quot;Companions Codex&quot; ====
Menzoberranzan appears prominently in the Companions Codex series by R. A. Salvatore, particularly in the first novel in the series &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot; (2014). The Drow of Menzoberranzan and Q&#x27;Xorlarrin, a settlement in Gauntylgyrm founded by the Menzoberranzan Drow from House Xorlarrin, are plotting war against the surface world because Menzoberranzan is on the brink of civil war and the Drow goddess Lolth is angry at the city. This leads to a conflict called the War of the Silver Marches which continues throughout the rest of the series, &quot;Rise of the King&quot; (2014) and &quot;Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf&quot; (2015).

Salvatore said that &quot;the War of the Silver Marches seems straightforward from afar - the orcs of Many Arrows, prodded by the drow, have decided to take on the alliance known as the Kingdoms of Luruar. Up close, however, it gets much more complicated, as the drow tease the frost giants to the side of the orcs, then throw in a couple of dragons (who have their own ulterior motives) for good measure. And of course, at a higher level, we&#x27;ve got a feud between a pair of goddesses, Lolth and Mielikki, kicking up the dust as well&quot;.

==== &quot;Homecoming&quot; trilogy ====
Menzoberranzan appears prominently in the &quot;Homecoming&quot; series by R. A. Salvatore, particularly in the first two novels &quot;Archmage&quot; (2015) and &quot;Maestro&quot; (2016). At the start of the series the War of the Silver Marches is over but the fate of Gauntylgyrm, a satellite settlement of Menzoberranzan, has yet to be decided and &quot;the dwarven kings and their allies are marching to reclaim Gauntlgrym, a dwarven stronghold lost some decades past. [...] Meanwhile, the drow of Menzoberranzan, led by their scheming Matron Mother, Quenthel Baenre, are planning the defence of Gauntlgrym, which they&#x27;ve claimed for their own. The first half of the book deals with what happens before the dwarfs reach Gauntlgrym, and the second half deals with what occurs when the two sides come into conflict. Weaving throughout this tale are a number of disaffected drow, of particular note are Jaraxle, of the Bregan D&#x27;aerthe mercenary company, and the eponymous Archmage, Gromph of House Baenre&quot;.

&quot;Archmage&quot; highlights the politics of Menzoberranzan with a focus on the Archmage Gromph Baenre. The events of the book setup the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;Rage of Demons&quot; storyline and the adventure &quot;Out of the Abyss&quot; (2015) as at the end of the novel, Archmage Gromph Baenre accidentally summons Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, to Menzoberranzan. The second book, &quot;Maestro&quot;, deals with the fallout of the &quot;Rage of Demons&quot; storyline in Menzoberranzan with a particular focus on Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden returning to the city and the story concludes in &quot;Hero&quot; (2016).

==== &quot;Generations&quot; trilogy ====
The &quot;Generations&quot; series by R. A. Salvatore follows the &quot;Homecoming&quot; trilogy. In the first novel, &quot;Timeless&quot; (2018), Menzoberranzan is one of the main locations and &quot;it follows the tumultuous life of Drizzt&#x27;s father, mentor figure, and idol Zaknafein, both in the past, when his friendship with the infamous mercenary captain Jarlaxle opened the door for his heresy, and in the present, after he is resurrected and reunited with his son&quot;. The series continues in &quot;Boundless&quot; (2019) and is concluded in &quot;Relentless&quot; (2020).

Salvatore said: &quot;I can tell you that for many years, and a lot of readers have agreed with me, I&#x27;ve said I really wanted to write a book about Zaknafein and Jarlaxle, but before Drizzt was born. How did they get to know each other? What was Menzoberranzan like? [...] So half the book takes place back before Drizzt was born, so I can reintroduce people to the dark elf city, through different eyes. Slightly different perspective on the dark elf city&quot;.

=== &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; ===
==== Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition ====
Ed Greenwood, Salvatore, and Douglas Niles collaborated to release a three-book box set in December 1992 called &quot;Menzoberranzan: The Famed City of the Drow&quot;. Ashe Collins, for &quot;Diehard Gamefan&quot;, wrote &quot;originally published by TSR in 1992, following the successful &quot;Homeland Trilogy&quot; by R. A. Salvatore, which featured the Drow city in great detail there, TSR sought to capitalize on it by providing far more detail to the actual city than they had before for GMs and players, and the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting&quot;.

The first two books cover the history of the fictional setting, while the final book serves as an adventure module:

* Book One: &quot;The City&quot;
* Book Two: &quot;The Houses&quot;
* Book Three: &quot;The Adventure&quot;

John ONeill, for &quot;Black Gate&quot;, wrote that &quot;one of my favorite RPG settings of all time is Menzoberranzan, the 1992 boxed set from TSR that drew liberally from R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s best-selling Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden novels. [...] Packed with 20,000 drow inhabitants, hundreds of thousands of humanoid slaves, and countless secrets and simmering rivalries, the home of the drow was an ideal adventure site for intrepid (and suitably high level) players&quot;.

Author Jeff LaSala, on the influence of Salvatore&#x27;s novels, wrote that at a signing he attended in the early 1990s &quot;with my hard-earned and very limited money I also bought the &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot; boxed set (ahh, back when they still made boxed sets regularly), which detailed the city of Drizzt’s origin. Now Dungeon Masters and players alike could fill their campaigns with feuding noble houses, evil matron mothers, and vile plots, but this time with actual maps of the city and ready-made NPCs. [...] Never mind that I was never able to use much of this stuff in my nerdy &quot;Stranger Things&quot;-but-in-the-90s D&amp;D group. But that&#x27;s okay—I still had innumerable hours of thinking up drow-based adventures ahead, whether I&#x27;d use them or not&quot;.

In November 1999, &quot;Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden&#x27;s Guide to the Underdark&quot; (1999), by Eric L. Boyd, was released. Appelcline wrote that it &quot;is the single-most comprehensive sourcebook on the realms of the Underdark that lie beneath the &quot;Sword Coast&quot;. It talks about the major peoples of the Underworld and details dozens of cities, including Menzoberranzan&quot; and that &quot;Boyd&#x27;s extensive research results in &quot;Underdark&quot; being full of tiny references. For example, drow cities are drawn from the list in &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; and from obscure references in &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot;&quot;.

A review for &quot;Pyramid&quot; identifies Menzoberranzan as one of &quot;the most famous pieces of the Realms&quot;.

==== 3rd Edition &amp; 3.5 ====
Menzoberranzan is briefly described in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (2001).

==== 4th Edition ====
In the 4th edition &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide&quot; (2008), Menzoberranzan is described as a key settlement in the Underdark and features an updated map.

In August 2012, &quot;&quot; (2012), by Brian R. James and Eric Menge, was published. This was an edition-neutral campaign setting book and was announced as part of the Rise of the Underdark event. Appelcline wrote that the book includes reprinted material from earlier sources &quot;covering the setting of Menzoberranzan, the houses of Menzoberranzan, and the drow of the Realms&quot; and it &quot;also advances the timeline of the city. This includes details on how the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; (2002–2005) changed the city and totally new material on the Spellplague. The result turns the system-neutral &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot; supplement into an era-neutral supplement that allows players to run Menzoberranzan in any era, from its 2e origins to the 4e present-day&quot;.

Ed Grabianowski, for &quot;Io9&quot;, wrote that &quot;the most famous of drow cities hasn&#x27;t received the splatbook treatment since 2nd Edition. [...] Plus, physically, Menzoberranzan is one of the coolest, most unique fantasy cities ever&quot;.

John ONeill, for &quot;Black Gate&quot;, wrote that after it was released &quot;nearly 20 years ago for second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, Menzoberranzan has not seen an update since and has been out of print for over 15 years. It was featured in the popular Menzoberranzan PC game from SSI/DreamForge, part of their &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; product line, in 1994, and very prominently in the six volume &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; novels, but it&#x27;s been far too long since my favorite underdark city-state appeared in a new edition&quot;.

Alex Lucard, for &quot;Diehard Gamefan&quot;, wrote that &quot;all in all, if you even remotely interested in the Drow as a race, &quot;Menzoberranzan: City of Intrigue&quot; is a book well worth picking up. It has a ton of helpful information, beautiful artwork and it strives to be friendly to all four versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. [...] I&#x27;m not the least bit interested in the Drow as a race, but I have to admit I was pretty impressed by this book. It may not be for me, but I can&#x27;t deny how well written and designed this campaign supplement is&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; included the book on a seasonal gift guide and wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s a wicked underground city packed full of scheming dark elves and their henchmen and slaves. The illustrations of the noble families are particularly excellent, and you really get a sense of the personalities of these houses. [...] This book is just the resource you need to run a campaign in the city or to inspire you to create your own evil city&quot;.

==== 5th Edition ====
In September 2015, Menzoberranzan received a dedicated chapter in the 5th edition book &quot;Out of the Abyss&quot; (2015). Henry Glasheen, for &quot;SLUG Magazine&quot;, wrote that the adventure &quot;leads through some of the most famous locations in The Underdark—if such places can be said to be famous. Many players will remember Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, but even lesser-known areas such as Blingdenstone and Gracklstugh are fully developed and ready to be explored&quot;.

== Fictional description ==
Menzoberranzan is an underground city populated by the drow, and ruled over by the priestesses of Lolth. The city has 20,000 drow inhabitants and hundreds of thousands of humanoid slaves such as goblins, kobolds, bugbears, duergar, svirfnebli, orcs, ogres, minotaurs, and giants, as well as herds of rothé kept as livestock. The city trades poisons, mushrooms, riding lizards, spell scrolls, wine, and water. The worship of Lolth is prevalent, and the city has the clerical academy Arach-Tinilith, a spider-shaped building where priestesses are trained. Arach-Tinilith is one of the three branches of the city&#x27;s Academy in the Tier Breche section of the city. Arach-Tinilith is neighbored by the warrior school Melee-Magthere, and Sorcere tower where arcane spellcasters are sent to study. These academies are the quarters of some of the most powerful clerics, fighters and wizards, respectively, and the title of master of an academy is coveted, since being the master of Sorcere or Melee-Magthere is as high as the power ladder goes for some houseless drow or even noble males.

On one edge of the city the family houses are located in their glory, while the edge near the lower level Drow houses there is a lake used to water the rothé. An island in the center is used to as an outlook post to help defend the city.

===Founding===
Menzoberranzan was founded by a priestess of Lolth named Menzoberra the Kinless in −3917 DR. It is ruled by a council of matrons from the eight greatest noble houses; the most powerful House in the city is House Baenre, until recently led by Matron Yvonnel Baenre—a drow cleric who was the single most powerful political figure in Menzoberranzan for about two thousand years. She has been succeeded by her daughter Triel. A separate council of mages deals with affairs of the arcane—but as its members are all male, it is wholly within the grip of the matrons.

===History===
Menzoberra the Kinless, a powerful priestess of Lolth, founded the city that bears her name in −3917 DR. By the wishes of Lady Lolth, she led seven drow families into the Northdark from the southerly drow holdings of Great Bhaerynden. The drow families, having no immediate external enemy, fell to attacking and undermining one another, as was drow nature, to the greater glory of their evil goddess, who so loved chaos. Only fifty years after the city&#x27;s founding, in −3864 DR, a great and terrible battle between the two most powerful Houses, House Nasadra and House S&#x27;sril, occurred. This battle led to the exile of House Nasadra (which later founded the city of Ched Nasad, and was the First House until the city&#x27;s recent destruction) and to the rise of House Baenre as the First House of Menzoberranzan.

The city&#x27;s internal machinations have continued unabated for millennia. The Houses that grow weak are destroyed, and newer Houses rise up to find Lolth&#x27;s favor. The full history of each House would constitute a nearly endless logbook of treachery, spite, and unceasing ambition. Within the last century, this pattern seems to have accelerated. House Do&#x27;Urden ascended from the Tenth House to the Ninth House by destroying the Fourth House, House DeVir. It then ascended to the Eighth House with the much-needed help of Jarlaxle&#x27;s mercenary band Bregan D&#x27;aerthe by destroying the Fifth House, House Hun&#x27;ett. House Do&#x27;Urden lost the favor of Lolth, however, when Matron Malice Do&#x27;Urden turned Zaknafein into a spirit-wraith by using Lolth&#x27;s dread &quot;Zin-Carla&quot; ritual and failed to kill Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden with him. This resulted in House Baenre utterly destroying House Do&#x27;Urden.

In 1359 DR, during the Time of Troubles, House Oblodra, the Third House, aspired to be the First House of Menzoberranzan. Menzoberranzan was caught in a magic dead zone, so magic did not work there. House Oblodra, however, was gifted in the rare art of psionics and seized upon this opportunity to strike at the other Houses. The matron of House Oblodra nearly reached her goal, but an avatar of Lolth answered Matron Baenre&#x27;s pleas for help and came to Menzoberranzan after the Time of Troubles had ended (the drow thought that she herself had restored all magic, but that is not true). Although she loved chaos, she did not wish to see a House that did not whisper prayer to her to rule the city. Foreseeing her temporary loss of power due to the Time of Troubles, Lolth had asked the demon Errtu to protect her worshippers, should she herself fail to do it. In return, Lolth gave Wulfgar over to Errtu as a prisoner, means by which the mighty demon could gain his revenge on Drizzt. She then opened a portal for Errtu and his host of demons to lay siege to House Oblodra. By the time the Time of Troubles had passed, Lolth was restored to full power and single-handedly crushed House Oblodra, the remains of their stronghold being pushed into a deep chasm known as the Clawrift, and Matron Oblodra&#x27;s spirit went to Errtu for eternal torment. Thus the ranks of the ruling Houses changed once again. All this she said was done for her greatest high priestess (although it was really done for herself), the two-thousand-year-old Matron Baenre. All Houses in the city witnessed this great miracle and knew that House Baenre was the most favored House of the goddess.

== Key factions ==
There are three types of factions in Menzoberranzan. At the top are the Houses with the eight greatest houses forming the Ruling Council of Menzoberranzan; &quot;the council determines the fate of the city, from the ranking of each house to whether an errant house must be destroyed. Drow factions that more or less uphold the social order of Menzoberranzan are the second category. These include the academy of Tier Breche and the mercenary company of Bregan D&#x27;aerthe. [...] The third group of factions consists of various internal and external forces opposed to the social order of Menzoberranzan&quot;.

=== Houses of Menzoberranzan ===
The Houses &quot;control all aspects of the city, from enforcing its few laws to dominating trade. Menzoberranzan has no standing army. Instead, the house guard of each of the noble houses provides the military might of the city. Their compounds are heavily fortified castles&quot;. Menzoberranzan has about 50 Houses which are all vying to increase their power and their ranking in the city as only the top eight Houses are part of the Ruling Council. The Houses all follow the same loose leadership structure: &quot;the house matron mother (the dictatorial ruling female head of the house), first priestess (typically the matron mother&#x27;s eldest daughter, who supervises the day-to-day operations of the house), house wizard (the leader of the house&#x27;s arcane spellcasters), house weapon master (who trains and leads the house warriors), and patron (the favored consort of the matron mother, who holds the highest rank possible for a male drow)&quot;.

The following are the topmost houses of Menzoberranzan:

# Baenre
# Barrison Del&#x27;Armgo
# Oblodra (destroyed by demons serving Yvonnel Baenre and, indirectly, Lolth in DR1358, described in &quot;Siege of Darkness&quot;)
# DeVir (destroyed by Do&#x27;Urden in DR1297, described in &quot;Homeland&quot;)
# Hun&#x27;ett (destroyed by Do&#x27;Urden in DR1338, described in &quot;Exile&quot;)
# Faen Tlabbar
# Xorlarrin
# Agrach Dyrr (became a vassal of House Baenre in DR1372 in the outcome of the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot;)
# Mizzrym
# Do&#x27;Urden (destroyed by Baenre in DR1340, described in &quot;Exile&quot;)
# Fey-Branche

=== The Academy ===
Tier Breche, the famed academy of the dark elves, sits on a high plateau at the western end of the city, protected by guardians and fell magics, the Academy consist of three structures, Arach-Tinilith (The School of Lolth) Sorcere (The School of Wizards) and Melee Magthere (The School of Fighters). Presided over by the Matron Mistress of the Academy, all drow both common and noble are required to attend the academy. Students&#x27; length of education is dependent on their sex and occupation. Male Fighters will spend 10 years, male wizards will spend 30, and female priestesses will spend 50 years learning their profession. The majority of time is spent within their specific school, but each student will spend a portion of their last year at each of the other schools, gaining a basic understanding of the strengths and weakness of the other classes.

;Melee Magthere
The School of Fighters is a pyramidal structure located on the east side of Tier Breche. Here males learn the art of swordplay, and individual and group fighting tactics. Beginning students spend their first sixty days unarmed under the instruction of The Master of Lore. Here they are indoctrinated against surface elves and non-drow. This racist propaganda provides a &#x27;safety valve&#x27;- extra aggression can be turned on the surface folk, rather than (completely) on the Drowish hierarchy. Their junior years are very harsh, but conditions improve as they grow older. Students in their 9th and final year serve as guards for Tier Breche, as well as participating in practice patrols within short distances outside of the city cavern. Each year, in order to establish a hierarchy within the class, the Grand Melee is held. During this event the students are set loose in a maze chamber outside the city cavern, wielding simple wooden poles as imitation weapons. The last male standing wins. In the tenth and final year, fighters will spend their first six months in Sorcere studying magic, and the final six months within Arach-Tinilith learning the precepts of Lolth - most importantly, the inferiority of males in her eyes.

;Sorcere
The School of Wizards is housed in a many spired stalagmite tower on the west of Tier Breche. Males will spend 30 years in study of the arcane arts, learning to channel the strange and unique magic of the drow that emanates from the Underdark. Acceptance as a student at Sorcere is highly coveted by young males as magic is the only path to any kind of real power in their matriarchal world. Masters of Sorcere are arguably the most powerful group of males within Menzoberranzan, headed by the city&#x27;s Archmage. Not only are they responsible for the training of future mages but also for regulating the use of arcane magic for all drow within Menzoberranzan.

;Arach-Tinilith
The School of Lolth is one of, if not the most important, holy sites within the church of Lolth. Standing at the center of Tier Breche, the school resembles a giant obsidian spider, sporting eight legs and a large central hall. Female clerics will spend 50 years in study under the Mistresses of Arach-Tinilith, learning the deeper codes, beliefs, and dogma of Lolth&#x27;s faith. Some of the most powerful holy artifacts of the drow are stored within the halls. It is here that students will undergo the graduation ceremony, often involving demon summoning and sexual orgies between the new clerics and male wizards or fighters, reinforcing the subservient role of drow males. The Matron Mistress of the Academy resides here and serves both as head instructor as well as the leader of the academy. Currently the Academy is presided over by Matron Mistress Quenthel Baenre, who succeeded her sister Matron Triel after the death of their mother.

===Bregan D&#x27;aerthe===
Bregan D&#x27;aerthe is a drow mercenary band based in the drow stronghold of Menzoberranzan and appears in many R. A. Salvatore novels. Founded by Jarlaxle Baenre as a means for houseless rogues to survive in Menzoberranzan, the group has thrived and expanded greatly since its inception. Due to its array of skilled soldiers and its many connections with the outside world, Bregan D&#x27;aerthe is a valued ally of many powerful drow houses. More than once in various novels, it has been remarked that Jarlaxle is one of the most protected drow in the Underdark due to the competent soldiers he surrounds himself with. This band of societal malcontents consists of approximately 150 members (though at times known to employ many more, having nearly one thousand agents at work with the Calimport initiative), mainly houseless males. Bregan D&#x27;aerthe has been very influential in the chaotic happenings of Menzoberranzan and has connections with Blingdenstone and has agents in Ched Nasad as well as major cities on the surface, most notably Luskan, Waterdeep, Calimport, and Heliogabalus. It was led by Jarlaxle Baenre, up until &quot;Servant of the Shard&quot; and is currently led by the drow psionicist Kimmuriel Oblodra. &quot;...no house desired conflict with Bregan D’aerthe. It was the most secretive of bands, few in the city could even guess at the numbers in the group, and its bases were tucked away in the many nooks and crannies of the wide cavern. The company&#x27;s reputation was widespread, though, tolerated by the ruling houses, and most in the city would name Jarlaxle among the most powerful of Menzoberranzan&#x27;s males&quot;. - &quot;Starless Night&quot;

&quot;...in Menzoberranzan, Jarlaxle and his spying network, Bregan D&#x27;aerthe, had no equal&quot;. - &quot;Starless Night&quot;

==Reception==
Menzoberranzan has been described as &quot;a perfect unjust state&quot; and compared to Glaucon&#x27;s vision of a state that is held together only by the fear of retribution.

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, in his review of &quot;Homeland&quot;, Rob Bricken says that &quot;where &quot;Homeland&quot; really shines—what hooked me as a kid, and what I still find fascinating now—is how thoroughly Salvatore examines drow society and the city of Menzoberranzan. From the cult of Lolth, the spider-goddess, to the matriarchal houses constantly scheming to destroy the others, to their equally Machiavellian education system, to the brutal class structure, Salvatore explores it all. He gives equal attention to the architecture and art of Menzoberranzan, and he&#x27;s gained enough skill to describe it with aplomb. What would look like utter darkness to us is a world of vivid color for the drow, whose nightvision (the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; term for being able to see the infrared spectrum) is unparalleled. It&#x27;s augmented by magic and the elves&#x27; ability to shape stone into works of art, ornate houses, and more&quot;.

==In other media==
=== Board games ===
* In 2011, the &quot;Legend of Drizzt Board Game&quot; was released. The adventure book in the game is inspired by the R. A. Salvatore novels and &quot;the first adventure, &quot;Exile&quot;, is inspired by the book of the same name and features Drizzt&#x27;s journey from Menzoberranzan to the surface&quot;.
* In 2016, the &quot;Tyrants of the Underdark&quot; board game was released. Players act as competing Drow houses trying to take control of locations in the Underdark such as Menzoberranzan and Blingdenstone.

=== Video games ===
* The city was the main location of the video game &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot; (1994). &quot;Dungeons and Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games&quot; said &quot;the last TSR-licensed game SSI published is the infamously wretched (and hard to spell) &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot;, which appeared in 1994 for DOS. [...] [It] had all the ingredients necessary for a hit. [...] Nevertheless, gamers quickly complained about the endless number of boring battles that drag out the game and ruin its pacing&quot;.
* In 2015, players in the MMO &quot;Neverwinter&quot; could accompany Drizzt to Menzoberranzan during its demonic assault in the Underdark Campaign. In 2023, the game&#x27;s &quot;Neverwinter: Menzoberranzan&quot; module featured the city as a new adventure zone and campaign.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* In 2014, Matt Hummel&#x27;s essay &quot;Menzoberranzan: A Perfect Unjust State&quot; appears in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Philosophy&quot;, a new volume in Wiley-Blackwell&#x27;s long running &quot;Philosophy and Pop Culture&quot; series. Hummel &quot;uses the infamous Drow city to discuss notions of justice and injustice&quot;.
* &quot;Sleep Sound&quot; (2021) is a poem by R. A. Salvatore which received an animated short to promote the &quot;Summer Of Drizzt&quot; marketing campaign. The short features Menzoberranzan; it was narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch and animated by The Sequence Group.
* &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot; (2023) producer Jeremy Latcham stated that the city seen at distance in the Underdark portion of the film was intended to be Menzoberranzan – Latcham commented that &quot;I don&#x27;t know if we actually ended up leaving it that on the map, but when we designed it originally, that was going to be Menzoberranzan. There was some controversy about it based on where we were with Dolblunde, which was kind of a made-up place&quot;.

<text>Bible Fellowship Church is a conservative pietistic Christian denomination with Mennonite roots centered in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Its denominational leader Donald T. Kirkwood described the denomination as &quot;reformed in theology, Presbyterian in polity, creedal immersionists.&quot;

==History==
===19th century===
Bible Fellowship Church (BFC) was founded as the Evangelische Mennoniten Gemeinschaft (Evangelical Mennonite Society) on September 24, 1858, in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.

Seven Mennonites influenced by revivalism, elder William Gehman, bishop William N. Shelly, preachers Henry Diehl and David Henning, and deacons David Gehman, Jacob Gottschall, and Joseph Schneider, refused to surrender to the pressure from their bishops to give up their evangelism. They responded by forming the new society, which combined Mennonite doctrine with enthusiastic evangelism.

In November 1879, the Evangelical Mennonites of Pennsylvania consolidated with the United Mennonites to become the Evangelical United Mennonites in November 1879.

In 1883, the Brethren in Christ Church in Ohio merged with the Evangelical United Mennonites to form the Mennonite Brethren in Christ.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, the Pennsylvania Conference of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ grew substantially. Membership doubled between 1900 and 1920 and again between 1920 and 1940. Since 1879, the Pennsylvania Conference held annual camp meetings. The first location was Chestnut Hill outside Coopersburg, Pennsylvania.

In 1910, the denomination purchased land near Allentown, Pennsylvania, called Mitzpah Grove. Located in East Allentown, the camp was located behind present-day Mosser Elementary School between Ellsworth Street at Walnut Street to Ellsworth Street and, inside the camp grounds, to Fairview Street. Between 1942 and 1945, during World War II, the annual camp meetings ceased but resumed again in 1946 following the war&#x27;s end.

In the 1940s, the relationship of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ Pennsylvania Conference with the other Mennonite Brethren in Christ conferences was strained. Disagreements existed over doctrine and ecclesiology, and these were intensified by personality differences.

In 1947, the General Conference of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ changed the name of the denomination to the United Missionary Church. The Pennsylvania Conference disagreed with the name change, and was allowed to continue under the old name.

Five years later, in 1952, the Pennsylvania Conference officially voted to separate themselves from the other conferences of the United Missionary Church and form their own denomination. The cause of the separation included differences of opinion over church government, the doctrine of holiness, education, foreign missions, and financial autonomy. The Pennsylvania Conference also objected to an expected merger with the Missionary Church Association—which would occur in 1969 creating a new consolidated denomination known as the Missionary Church.

In 1959, the Pennsylvania Conference of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ adopted its present name, &#x27;Bible Fellowship Church, and approved new articles of faith, which included dropping the practice of feet washing. The church government&#x27;s structure was gradually changed to a more Presbyterian style. Local elders rule individual Bible Fellowship churches, and each of the individual churches sends their elders and pastors to the annual conference.

In the mid-20th century, the denomination&#x27;s core soteriological viewpoint gradually changed from its early Anabaptist and Arminian perspective to its current Reformed Theology focus.

In 1968, the Bible Fellowship Church sold its Mizpah Grove property in Allentown, and acquired Pinebrook Bible Conference in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania as the site for its annual camp meeting.

In an address at the 1962 Annual Conference in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, Donald Kirkwood noted that, &quot;historically we were Arminian; gradually but progressively we became Dispensational; presently we are in transition. There are remnants of Arminianism, and Dispensationalism, also an active Calvinism.&quot;

===21st century===
In a departure from many other reformed churches, Bible Fellowship Churches continue the Anabaptist practice of believer&#x27;s baptism. It also holds to Premillennialism.

BFC maintains its headquarters in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania. Its ministries include the Bible Fellowship Board of Missions, Church Extension Ministries, Fellowship Community, a home for the aged, and Victory Valley Youth Camp. Most of BFC&#x27;s churches are located in eastern Pennsylvania. There are also churches in Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Virginia.

As of 2023, there were 6,687 members in 67 congregations with a total church family size of 14,412.

== Pinebrook Ministries ==

=== Pinebrook Junior College ===
In 1950, the Pennsylvania Conference of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ supported the opening of Berean Bible School in Allentown. When the Bible Fellowship Church purchased the Pinebrook Bible Conference in Stroudsburg in 1968, the Allentown campus of the Berean Bible School was sold. The next year, the school reopened as Pinebrook Junior College on the Stroudsburg property. It began granting associate degrees in 1970. In 1976, the college relocated to Coopersburg, Pennsylvania to a property that formerly housed a school and orphanage run by Sisters of the Sacred Heart that had closed in 1974. In 1992, the junior college ceased operations due to declining enrollment causing inadequate finances. In response, the Bible Fellowship Church created the Pinebrook Educational Foundation in 1994 to provide financial aid to Christian students studying at Christian post-secondary institutions. In 2014, the former Coopersburg property was destroyed to make way for a new residential condominium development.

===Pinebrook Bible Conference===
Pinebrook Bible Conference is a Christian camp and conference center in the Pocono Mountains in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1933 by Percy Crawford, an evangelist who led a radio ministry in Philadelphia, Pinebrook hosted prominent speakers and musicians, including Billy Graham, Jack Wyrtzen, 
J. Oliver Buswell, William Bell Riley, William Henry Houghton, Robert T. Ketcham, Cliff Barrows, and George Beverly Shea.

In 1968, Pinebrook came under the umbrella of Bible Fellowship Church. On October 17, 2018, Spruce Lake took over stewardship of Pinebrook, while Bible Fellowship Church continues to offer events, retreats, and conferences at the property.

<doc id="414908" wikidata="Q156710" url="?curid=414908" title="Fever (Kylie Minogue album)">
<text>Fever is the eighth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It was released on 1 October 2001, by Parlophone. Minogue worked with writers and producers such as Cathy Dennis, Rob Davis, Richard Stannard, Julian Gallagher, TommyD, Tom Nichols, Pascal Gabriel and others to create a disco and Europop-influenced dance-pop and nu-disco record. Other musical influences of the album range from synth-pop to club music.

&quot;Fever&quot; was well-received by critics upon its release, many of whom praised its production and commercial appeal. Over the years the album has received widespread critical acclaim and has been retrospectively declared the greatest album of Minogue&#x27;s career by publications such as &quot;NME&quot;. A global commercial success, it peaked at number one in Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Russia, and the UK. In the US, the album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Minogue&#x27;s best-selling album in the country; it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was also certified septuple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and quintuple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). At the 2002 Brit Awards, it won International Album.

&quot;Fever&quot; produced four singles. The lead single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; peaked atop the charts of 40 countries. Often recognised as Minogue&#x27;s signature song, it is her best-selling single with five million units sold worldwide. &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; also became international hits, while &quot;Come into My World&quot; won Minogue her first Grammy Award, for Best Dance Recording, in 2004. To further promote the album, Minogue embarked on her seventh concert tour, KylieFever2002. &quot;Fever&quot; has sold over six million copies worldwide as of 2021.

== Background and production ==
In 1998, Minogue was dropped from her label Deconstruction following the poor commercial performance of her sixth studio album &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;. She instead signed on to Parlophone and released her seventh studio album &quot;Light Years&quot;. The disco and Europop-inspired album was a critical and commercial success, and was later certified four times-platinum in Minogue&#x27;s native country Australia for shipment of 280,000 units, and platinum in the UK for shipment of 300,000 units. &quot;Spinning Around&quot; was released as the lead single off the album and was a commercial success, attaining a platinum certification in Australia for shipment of 70,000 units, and a silver certification in the United Kingdom for shipment of 200,000 units. She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour.

Soon after, Minogue began work on her eighth studio album &quot;Fever&quot;. On the album, she collaborated with producers and writers such as British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis, who co-wrote two songs out of the three she co-produced, Rob Davis, who co-produced and co-wrote three songs, and Richard Stannard and Julian Gallagher, who co-produced and co-wrote five songs (&quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Love Affair&quot;, &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous at Sunset&quot;). In the vein of &quot;Light Years&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot; is a disco and dance-pop album that contains elements of adult contemporary and club music. The album was recorded at studios such as the Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, Hutch Studios in Chicago, Olympic Studios in London and Stella Studios.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Fever&quot; is primarily a dance-pop album, with prominent elements of 1970s-influenced disco and Europop. Jacqueline Hodges from BBC Music wrote that the album is not &quot;pure pop&quot;, and is rather characterized by a more adventurous dance-oriented sound. &quot;NME&quot; critic Alex Needham identified a &quot;filter disco effect&quot;, described as &quot;the one that sounds like you&#x27;ve gone under water and then ecstatically come up for air,&quot; working on various songs on the album. Furthermore, Jaelani Turner-Williams of &quot;Stereogum&quot; retrospectively classified the record as a nu-disco album. Needham saw &quot;Fever&quot; as an &quot;update&quot; from the &quot;frothy disco&quot; of &quot;Light Years&quot;. Songs like the opening track &quot;More More More&quot; and closing track &quot;Burning Up&quot; are examples of the disco-influenced production of the album. The former is an uptempo song with a &quot;funky&quot; bassline, while the latter was described as a &quot;slow burn&quot; disco song. Teen pop elements appear on songs like &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, which begins with an electric piano intro, and the &quot;aggressive&quot; &quot;Give It to Me&quot;.

The lead single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; is a &quot;robotic&quot; midtempo dance and disco song. Many critics felt that various songs on the album, particularly &quot;Come into My World&quot;, are similar to &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. The title track and &quot;Dancefloor&quot; draw influences from synthpop and club music, respectively. &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; contains hints of disco and techno music. Minor influences of ambient music surface on the &quot;atmospheric&quot; &quot;Fragile&quot;. Minogue&#x27;s vocal delivery ranges from &quot;sensuous&quot; (in &quot;More More More&quot;) to &quot;sweet&quot; (in &quot;Your Love&quot;). The latter track contains instrumentation from an acoustic guitar. Jason Thompson from PopMatters commented that Minogue &quot;knows how to express herself through irresistible melodies and seductive emoting&quot;, such as on the title track, which makes use of &quot;suggestive panting&quot;. Unlike Minogue&#x27;s previous studio efforts, &quot;Fever&quot; does not contain any ballads.

The lyrical content of &quot;Fever&quot; chiefly focuses on themes of love and enjoyment. Thompson described the album to be &quot;all about dancing, fucking, and having a good time&quot;. In the song &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, Minogue describes how she fell in love with her partner at &quot;first sight&quot; and how it led to good things happening for her. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; was termed a &quot;mystery&quot; as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that Minogue refers to either &quot;a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn&#x27;t know she exists&quot; as her obsession. The production of &quot;Give It to Me&quot; contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to &quot;slow down,&quot; but the beat &quot;goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;Fragile&quot; are simple and aim directly at the &quot;[listener&#x27;s] heart&quot;. &quot;Come into My World&quot; is a &quot;plea for love&quot; as Minogue invites her partner into her life. On the other hand, &quot;Dancefloor&quot; focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by &quot;lose[ing] it in the music&quot;.

==Artwork and release==
Minogue&#x27;s close friend and stylist William Baker, collaborated with graphic designer Tony Hung to create the artwork&#x27;s concept of electro-minimalism. On the cover, which was photographed by Vincent Peters and inspired by the cover of Grace Jones&#x27; &quot;Island Life&quot; (1985), Minogue is seen &quot;bound by a microphone cord, literally tied to her craft&quot; and dressed in white leotard designed by Fee Doran, under the label of Mrs Jones, and shoes made by Manolo Blahnik. In her 2012 fashion retrospective book &quot;Kylie / Fashion&quot;, Minogue commented on the album&#x27;s theme, saying: &quot;The whole campaign was so strong, sure, ice cool. Willie&#x27;s [William&#x27;s] styling was incredible and [Peters&#x27;] photography made for a second amazing album cover with him.&quot; A new cover was issued for the US version of the album and features a close-up of Minogue biting on a bracelet. The US version cover also served as one of two CD single covers for second single of the album, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;.

&quot;Fever&quot; was released by Parlophone on 1 October 2001, in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. In the United States, the album was released by Capitol Records on 26 February 2002, and was Minogue&#x27;s first album to be released in the country since her second studio album &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; (1989). Thus, Minogue was reintroduced to the US after nearly 13 years of inactivity in the region. A special edition of the album, containing a previously unreleased track entitled &quot;Whenever You Feel Like It&quot;, was released on 19 November 2002.

== Promotion ==
=== Tour ===

Minogue launched the KylieFever2002 concert tour to promote the album. The tour was split in seven acts and &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, &quot;Come into My World&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot; were the songs from the album to be included on the setlist. For the performances, Minogue wore &quot;skimpy&quot; and skin-tight outfits, and was often seen wearing a glittering silver bikini and skirt coupled with silver boots. The outfits were designed by Italian luxury industry fashion house Dolce and Gabbana, and Minogue went through a total of eight costume changes during the tour. The performances that took place at the Manchester Evening News Arena, England, were filmed for inclusion in the live DVD for the concert tour entitled &quot;KylieFever2002: Live in Manchester&quot;, which was released on 18 November 2002. The DVD was certified platinum in Canada for sales of 10,000 units, gold in Germany for sales of 25,000 units, and double-platinum in the United Kingdom for shipments of 100,000 units.

=== Singles ===

&quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on 8 September 2001. The song was well received by music critics, many of whom complimented its vibe and danceability. Commercially, the single was a massive success and peaked at number one on the charts of every European country (except Finland) and Australia. The song was released in the United States on 18 February 2002 and managed to peak at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, becoming Minogue&#x27;s best selling single in the region since &quot;The Locomotion&quot;. It was certified triple-platinum in Australia for shipment of 210,000 units, platinum in the United Kingdom for shipment of 600,000 units, and gold in the United States for shipment of 500,000 units. An accompanying music video for the single was directed by Dawn Shadforth and features Minogue and a number of backup dancers dancing in various futuristic backdrops.
&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was released as the second single of the album on 21 January 2002, but in Europe, the release was delayed to 18 February due to the success of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. It received generally positive reviews from music critics and was praised for its house influences. It became the second consecutive single from the album to peak atop the Australian Singles Chart. The song was also commercially successful internationally and peaked in the top ten of charts in countries like Italy, Finland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It was certified gold in Australia for sales of 35,000 units, and silver in the United Kingdom for sales of 200,000 units. An accompanying music video for the song was again directed by Shadforth, and features Minogue performing a dance routine and striking various poses in a colourful neon-lighted room.

&quot;Love at First Sight&quot; was released as the third single from the album on 3 June 2002. It received positive reviews from music critics, with many favouring its production. The song was a commercial success and peaked in the top ten of charts in countries like Australia, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand and United Kingdom. The song was remixed by Ruff and Jam and this version was released in the United States, where it managed to chart at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It was certified gold in Australia for sales of 35,000 units and in New Zealand for sales of 7,500 units. An accompanying music video for the single was directed by Johan Renck and features Minogue dancing in a futuristic environment sporting cargo pants and teal eyeshadow. The song was later nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2003.

&quot;Come into My World&quot; was released as the fourth and final single off the album on 4 November 2002. Slightly remixed, the single version featured new vocals in the verses and chorus. It generated a favourable response from music critics, who enjoyed its lyrical content. Commercially, the single performed fairly well and peaked in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium (French-speaking Wallonia region), and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It received a gold certification in Australia for sales of 35,000 units. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Michel Gondry and features Minogue strolling around a busy street in Paris, France; every time she completes a full circle, a duplicate of her appears through one of the stores, and by the end of the video there are four Minogues present together. The song was later honoured with a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording during the 2004 ceremony.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Fever&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Fever&quot; received an average score of 68 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Jason Thompson from &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album an extremely positive review and praised the conception and production of the album, calling it a &quot;perfect album of gorgeous dance music&quot; and claiming that &quot;there probably won&#x27;t be a better album like it all year long&quot;. Chris True from AllMusic also gave it an acclaimed review and enjoyed the simple disco and dancepop music of the album, saying that there is &quot;not one weak track, not one misplaced syrupy ballad to ruin the groove&quot;. Alex Needham from &quot;NME&quot; positively reviewed the album and noted that while the album lacks depth, it is &quot;as effervescent as a foot spa&quot; and that through the album, Minogue &quot;shows the upstarts how it&#x27;s done&quot;. Dominique Leone from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave it a favourable review and praised its simple and &quot;comfortable&quot; composition, terming it a &quot;mature sound from a mature artist, and one that may very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation&quot;.

Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the commercial nature of the album and called it &quot;a mature pop album only in that it&#x27;s aimed at the boozy girl&#x27;s night out rather than the school disco&quot;. Jacqueline Hodges favoured the album&#x27;s consistency and complimented its commercial prospect, predicting that the album is &quot;going to sell bucket loads&quot;. Jim Farber from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; labelled the album &quot;the best guilty-pleasure retro-dance smash since Eiffel 65&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot;&quot;, but felt that Minogue &quot;milks the formula (of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;) dry on the album&quot;. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH enjoyed the fun nature of the album and said that &quot;if you want something to drive to, dance to, play at a house party or cheer your workmates up with, &quot;Fever&quot; is for you&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the album a negative review, criticizing Minogue&#x27;s &quot;painfully precise&quot; vocals and the album&#x27;s monotony.

==Accolades==
&quot;Fever&quot; also brought Minogue a number of accolades and award nominations. At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards ceremony, the album won the awards for Best Pop Release and Highest Selling Album, and garnered a nomination in the category of Album of the Year. At the same ceremony, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; won the awards for Single of the Year and Highest Selling Single, and Minogue won the Outstanding Achievement Award. At the 2002 Brit Awards ceremony, &quot;Fever&quot; won the award for Best International Album, while Minogue was nominated for Best International Female Solo Artist and Best Pop Act, winning the former. At the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony, the album was nominated for Best Album; Minogue was nominated for Best Female Act, Best Dance Act, and Best Pop Act, winning the latter two.

Minogue earned her first Grammy Award nomination when &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 2003 award ceremony, although it lost to British electronic band Dirty Vegas&#x27;s song &quot;Days Go By&quot;. She eventually won a Grammy Award when &quot;Come into My World&quot; was nominated in the same category at the 2004 award ceremony. It marked the first time an Australian music artist had won at the Grammy Awards show since Australian rock band Men at Work won the award for Best New Artist in 1982, as well as Minogue&#x27;s career-first Grammy win. In 2015, &quot;Fever&quot; was ranked 34th on &quot;The 99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time&quot; by &quot;Vice&quot; magazine. In December 2021, the album was listed at no. 10 in Rolling Stone Australia&#x27;s ‘200 Greatest Albums of All Time’ countdown.

==Legacy==
&quot;Fever&quot; is considered to be a prominent example of Minogue&#x27;s constant &quot;reinventions&quot;. The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as &quot;slick, minimalist and postmodern&quot;, and it was seen as a step forward from the &quot;camp-infused&quot; tone of &quot;Light Years&quot;. Larissa Dubecki from &quot;The Age&quot; used the term &quot;nu-disco diva&quot; to describe Minogue during this period. Andy Battaglia from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; opined that Minogue&#x27;s public image and her persona in her music videos &quot;presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal&quot;. He further remarked that the singer&#x27;s &quot;hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, tonguing the sweet-and-sour tang of a techno kiss&quot;.

Adrien Begrand from &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that the simplicity of the album made it a &quot;classy piece of work&quot; and commented that Minogue&#x27;s experience and choice of collaborators resulted in &quot;the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [Spears] and Christina [Aguilera]&quot;. Robbie Daw from &quot;Idolator&quot; pointed out that Britney Spears&#x27;s recording of her 2004 hit &quot;Toxic&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005), Paris Hilton&#x27;s musical debut &quot;Paris&quot; (2006), and radio stations&#x27; shift towards playing &quot;more groove-oriented sounds&quot; all followed the release of &quot;Fever&quot;, although he mentioned that &quot;we have no way of knowing whether [Fever] was directly responsible for these pop happenings&quot;. Nick Levine from &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Fever&quot; as the greatest album of Minogue&#x27;s career, noting &quot;the project’s effortless confidence and strength in depth.&quot;

Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; cemented her position as an international music icon, saying &quot;Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well&quot;. The lead single peaked atop charts in 40 countries and sold more than six million copies worldwide, becoming Minogue&#x27;s highest selling single to date and one of the best-selling singles of all time. The song is notable for being Minogue&#x27;s biggest and strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States, a region in which Minogue previously had managed to achieve little success. It is also considered to be Minogue&#x27;s signature song. Due to the single&#x27;s commercial impact, the album enjoyed similar success in the United States and earned Minogue her only platinum album certification in the region.

<text>Aerophilately is the branch of philately that specializes in the study of airmail. Philatelists have observed the development of mail transport by air from its beginning, and all aspects of airmail service have been extensively studied and documented by specialists.

== Scope ==
The scope of aerophilately includes:
*airmail postage stamps, both official and unofficial (see list of US airmail postage here)
*other types of labels (such as airmail etiquettes)
*postal documents transmitted by air
*postal markings related to air transport
*rates and routes, particularly first flights and other &quot;special&quot; flights
*mail recovered from aircraft accidents and other incidents (crash covers)

While most of the study of airmail assumes transport by fixed-wing aircraft, the fields of balloon mail, dirigible mail, zeppelin mail, missile mail, and rocket mail are active subspecialties. Astrophilately, the study of mail in space, is a related area.

==Organizations==
International Federation of Aerophilatelic Societies (FISA) is the umbrella organization for aerophilately though aerophilatelists have formed a number of organizations around the world; many of them put out a variety of specialized publications. Federation Internationale de Philatelie (FIP) also maintains a commission.

<doc id="414916" wikidata="Q244312" url="?curid=414916" title="Vince Cable">
<text>Sir John Vincent Cable (born 9 May 1943) is a British politician who was Leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2017 to 2019. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Twickenham from 1997 to 2015 and from 2017 to 2019. He also served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills from 2010 to 2015.

Cable studied Economics at Cambridge and Glasgow, before working as an economic adviser to the Government of Kenya in the 1960s, and for the Commonwealth Secretariat in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, he also lectured in economics at Glasgow. He later served as Chief Economist for Shell in the 1990s. Initially active in the Labour Party, Cable became a Labour councillor in Glasgow in the 1970s, during which time he also served as a special adviser to then-Trade Secretary John Smith. In 1982, however, he defected to the newly formed Social Democratic Party, which later amalgamated with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats.

After standing unsuccessfully for Parliament four times, Cable was elected for Twickenham in 1997. He was quickly appointed the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, and was later elected as Deputy Leader in 2006. Cable resigned from both of these positions in May 2010 after being appointed as Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in the coalition government. He lost his seat in 2015, although later regained it in 2017. Cable subsequently stood in the leadership election to replace Tim Farron, and was elected unopposed.

In May 2019, Cable led the Liberal Democrats to their best national electoral performance since the 2010 election, gaining fifteen seats in the European Parliament election. This followed a campaign in which the party ran on an anti-Brexit platform. He subsequently announced his intention to retire from politics, and stood down as leader on 22 July 2019, upon the election of Jo Swinson; he stood down from Parliament at the 2019 general election.

On 2 July 2022, Cable was announced as Vice President of the European Movement.

==Early life and education==
Cable was born in York, to a working class Conservative-supporting family. His father, Len, was a craftsman for Rowntree&#x27;s, and his mother, Edith, packed chocolates for Terry&#x27;s. Cable attended Nunthorpe Grammar School where he became Head Boy. He then attended Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he initially studied Natural Sciences and later switched to Economics. He was the President of the Cambridge Union in 1965. He was also a committee member and later President-elect of the Cambridge University Liberal Club, but he resigned from the Liberal Party before taking up the office of President. Whilst at Cambridge, he was a contemporary of the Cambridge Mafia.

In 1966, at the end of his studies at the University of Cambridge, Cable was appointed as an Overseas Development Institute Fellow (ODI Nuffield Fellow) working in Kenya.

He graduated in 1973 with a PhD in Economics from the University of Glasgow on economic integration and industrialisation.

==Economics career==
Cable lectured for a time at the University of Glasgow and was a visiting research fellow at the Centre for the Study of Global Governance at the London School of Economics, for a three-year period until 2004. In 2016, Cable was made Honorary Professor of Economics at the University of Nottingham.

From 1966 to 1968, he was a Treasury Finance Officer to the Kenyan government. In 1969, he visited Central America as a researcher on the recently formed Central American Common Market.

From the early to mid-1970s, Cable served as First Secretary under Hugh Carless in the Latin American department of the Foreign Office. He was involved in a CBI trade mission to South America at this time, engaging in six months of commercial diplomacy. In the late 1970s, he was special adviser to John Smith when the latter was Trade Secretary. He was an adviser to the UK Government and then to the Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath &quot;Sonny&quot; Ramphal in the 1970s and 1980s.

Cable served in an official capacity at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of 1983 in Delhi, witnessing &quot;private sessions at first hand&quot; involving Indira Gandhi, then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Lee Kuan Yew, and Bob Hawke among others. He was also present at the summits of 1985, 1987, and 1989. In the same period, he contributed to the Brandt Commission, the Palme Commission, and the UN&#x27;s Brundtland Commission.

From the 1980s onwards, Cable authored and co-wrote numerous publications in favour of globalisation, free trade, and economic integration such as &quot;Protectionism and Industrial Decline&quot;, &quot;The Commerce of Culture&quot;, and &quot;Developing with Foreign Investment&quot;.

Cable worked for the oil company Royal Dutch Shell from 1990 to 1997, serving as its Chief Economist between 1995 and 1997. His role at Shell came under scrutiny as the company was accused of playing a role in a turbulent era of Nigerian politics during the dictatorship of General Sani Abacha.

In 2017, Cable became a strategic advisor on the World Trade Board for the annual World Trade Symposium co-organised by Misys and FT Live.

==Political career==
===Early years===
At university, Cable was a member of the Liberal Party but then joined the Labour Party in 1966. In 1970, he contested Glasgow Hillhead for Labour, but failed to unseat the sitting Conservative MP, Tam Galbraith. The same year, Cable stood for election to the Corporation of Glasgow in the Partick West ward, but failed to be elected. He became a Labour councillor in 1971, representing Maryhill ward, and stood down in 1974. In 1979, he sought the Labour Party nomination for Hampstead, losing to Ken Livingstone, who was unsuccessful in taking the seat.

In February 1982, he defected to the recently created Social Democratic Party (SDP). He was the SDP–Liberal Alliance parliamentary candidate for his home city of York in both the 1983 and 1987 general elections. Following the 1988 merger of the SDP and the Liberal Party, he finished in second place at the 1992 general election to Conservative MP Toby Jessel in the Twickenham constituency, by 5,711 votes.

===Member of Parliament (1997–2015)===
Cable entered the House of Commons after defeating sitting Conservative MP Toby Jessel in the Twickenham constituency in his second attempt, at the 1997 general election. He subsequently increased his majority at the elections of 2001, 2005 and increased still further in 2010. He lost his seat in 2015, but regained it at the snap election in 2017.

In 2004, Cable was a contributor to the economically liberal &quot;Orange Book,&quot; which advocated for policies such as greater private sector involvement in higher education and healthcare. However, he has described himself as being a social democrat, as well as an &quot;open markets&quot; liberal, and stated his desire to reconcile &quot;economic liberalism with wider moral values and social justice&quot;.

Following the &quot;Orange Book&quot;, Cable was one of several Lib Dem MPs who oversaw the party&#x27;s shift towards economic liberalism with the adoption of a more free market approach, a development which was suggested by some as having helped lead to the 2010 coalition with the Conservatives. In 2005, as Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, he suggested the possibility of the party dropping its commitment to a 50p top rate of income tax, supported exempting people on low income from income tax completely, and explored the possibility of a flat tax, with the former two proposals later becoming party policy. Also in 2005, he said that there was no future for the Liberal Democrats to the left of New Labour. He was critical of what he considered the Labour government&#x27;s slow response to cutting government waste, later accusing Labour of allowing a &quot;writhing nest&quot; of quangos to develop.

Prior to the 2005 Liberal Democrat party conference, Cable did not rule out the possibility that the Lib Dems might form a coalition government with the Conservatives in the event of a hung parliament at the forthcoming general election. However, party leader Charles Kennedy said that the Lib Dems would remain an &quot;independent political force&quot;.

In late-2005 or early-2006, Cable presented Charles Kennedy a letter signed by eleven out of the twenty-three frontbenchers, including himself, expressing a lack of confidence in Kennedy&#x27;s leadership of the Liberal Democrats. On 5 January 2006, because of pressure from his frontbench team and an ITN News report documenting his alcoholism, Charles Kennedy announced a leadership election in which he pledged to stand for re-election. However, he resigned on 7 January. Cable did not run for the party leadership, instead supporting Menzies Campbell&#x27;s candidacy.

====Expenses====
A Twickenham resident, Cable commuted by train into Central London daily and so claimed the &quot;London Supplement&quot; instead of the Additional Costs Allowance. However, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported in May 2009 that he had been unaware that he was entitled to the London Supplement and so in 2004 wrote to the Fees Office to ask if he could receive retrospective payments for 2002–03 and 2003–04. The Fees Office refused the request, informing Cable that these accounts were already closed.

When overall MP allowances are ranked, Cable came in 568th for 2007–08 (out of 645 MPs). &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; also noted that he did not take a recent 2.33% salary rise.

===Deputy Leadership of the Liberal Democrats (2006–2010)===

Cable won plaudits for his repeated warnings and campaigns on the high level of personal debt in Britain. His was a significant voice of criticism during the Northern Rock crisis, calling for the nationalisation of the bank, capitalising on the claimed indecisiveness of both the Labour Government and Conservative Opposition on the issue.

In May 2010, Cable declared his resignation as Deputy Leader to dedicate more time to his Cabinet role as Business Secretary. His responsibilities and authority were somewhat reduced when it was revealed in December 2010 that he had boasted to &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reporters posing as constituents of his &quot;nuclear option&quot; to bring the government down by his resignation. Still worse, he claimed to the reporters that he had &quot;declared war&quot; on Rupert Murdoch of News Corporation despite having the responsibility to impartially arbitrate on the News Corporation bid to acquire the remaining 60.9% of BSkyB it did not already own. Amid cries for his resignation or sacking, all his responsibilities concerning the bid were removed. Cable did not resign.

====Acting leader of the Liberal Democrats (2007)====
Following the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell as Party Leader on 15 October 2007, Cable being Deputy Leader automatically succeeded him as Party Leader, pending a leadership election. He declined to stand for leader, reportedly fearing ageism (Campbell&#x27;s critics were accused of ageism, and Cable was only 2 years his junior).

Cable received significant acclaim during his tenure as Acting Party Leader, with particular praise for his strong performances at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. He was popular in the party and media for his attacks on the government&#x27;s record over Northern Rock, HMRC&#x27;s loss of 25,000,000 individuals&#x27; child benefit data and the party funding scandal surrounding David Abrahams&#x27; secret donations to the Labour Party. The latter attracted for Cable positive media attention for a joke at PMQs describing Gordon Brown&#x27;s &quot;remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from Stalin to Mr. Bean, creating chaos out of order rather than order out of chaos&quot;, called by &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;the single best line of Gordon Brown&#x27;s premiership&quot;.

====Views on the financial crisis====

Cable is credited by some with prescience of the global financial crisis of 2007–2010. In November 2003, Cable asked Gordon Brown, then-Chancellor, &quot;Is not the brutal truth that ... the growth of the British economy is sustained by consumer spending pinned against record levels of personal debt, which is secured, if at all, against house prices that the Bank of England describes as well above equilibrium level?&quot; Brown replied, &quot;As the Bank of England said yesterday, consumer spending is returning to trend. The Governor said,
&quot;there is no indication that the scale of debt problems have ... risen markedly in the last five years.&quot; He also said that the fraction of household income used up in debt service is lower than it was then.&quot;

In his book &quot;The Storm&quot;, Cable writes, &quot;The trigger for the current global financial crisis was the US mortgage market and, indeed, the scale of improvident and unscrupulous lending on that side of the Atlantic dwarfs into insignificance the escapades of our own banks.&quot; Cable commented that he had not warned about this: &quot;one of the problems of being a British MP is that you do tend to get rather parochial and I haven&#x27;t been to the States for years and years, so I wouldn&#x27;t claim to have any feel for what&#x27;s been going on there.&quot;

In September 2008, Cable praised the-then US President George W. Bush for his response to the financial crisis and for attempting to &quot;save Western capitalism.&quot; He compared this with Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s response which Cable claimed was to be like a &quot;Fairy Godmother&quot; to the banks, and a &quot;sideshow&quot;.

Cable has also been vocal over the bonus culture in the banking system. He has called for bonuses to all bank employees to be frozen.

However, Cable has been criticised by some, mostly Conservatives, for &quot;flip-flopping&quot; on issues in connection with the crisis. For example, he is accused of criticising the Government&#x27;s policy of Quantitative easing, when in January 2009 he used the phrase &quot;the Robert Mugabe school of economics&quot;, while in March 2009 he said, &quot;directly increasing the amount of money flowing into the economy is now the only clear option&quot;. The Liberal Democrats also have responded that he was making the point that QE &quot;needed to be managed with a great deal of care&quot;.

On the issue of fiscal stimulus, Cable said in October 2008, &quot;it is entirely wrong for the government to assume the economy should be stimulated by yet more public spending rather than tax cuts&quot;. In February 2009, however, he said, &quot;we believe – and the Government say that they believe – in the need for a fiscal stimulus. Despite the severe financial constraints on the public sector, we believe that such a stimulus is right and necessary&quot;.

On the principle of the independence of the Bank of England, Cable said at the 2008 Liberal Democrat party conference, &quot;The Government must not compromise the independence of the Bank of England by telling it to slash interest rates.&quot; The following month, though, he called on the Chancellor to urge the Governor of the Bank to make &quot;a large cut in interest rates&quot;. The Liberal Democrats have responded that this in no way changes their policy on Bank of England independence.

===Coalition government minister (2010–2015)===

At the 2010 general election Cable was again returned as MP for Twickenham. With the election resulting in a hung parliament, Cable was a key figure in coalition talks, particularly the unsuccessful negotiations with the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats entered a coalition agreement with the Conservative Party on 11 May 2010, and Cable was appointed Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills on 12 May. The Queen approved his appointment as a Privy Counsellor, and he formally joined the Privy council on 13 May 2010.

In May 2010, Cable insisted the coalition government was not split over planned increases to non-business Capital gains tax, which some thought would raise taxes on sales of second homes by 40% or 50%. Senior Conservative MPs attacked the rise as a tax on the middle-classes and a betrayal of Conservative values. Cable said that it was a &quot;key&quot; part of the coalition deal and there was no disagreement over it between the coalition partners. Cable said the changes to Capital Gains Tax would help to fulfill the Lib Dem aim of bringing more &quot;fairness&quot; to the tax system: &quot;It&#x27;s very important that we have wealth taxed in the same way as income.&quot; He continued,

In July 2010, Cable sought to reform credit lines amid a &quot;significant demand&quot; (according to the Forum of Private Business) of smaller firms finding it harder to secure loans. Among a range of proposals published in a green paper, Cable urged banks to limit bonus and dividend payments to &quot;pre-crisis and 2009 levels respectively&quot;, the green paper stating that such a move would enable banks to retain £10,000,000,000 of additional capital in 2010 could in turn sustain £50,000,000,000 of new lending. 

The left-leaning parts of the British press have been critical of his role in the Coalition Government, from &quot;The Guardian&quot; to the &quot;Morning Star&quot; describing him as &quot;the man who started off a Lib Dem and now looks more convincingly Tory than most of the Tory frontbench&quot; for his role in supporting public spending cuts.

Beginning in 2010 and continuing throughout the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition&#x27;s tenure in office, Cable led the drive for deregulation; notably the &quot;Red Tape Challenge&quot; to reduce existing regulation and the &quot;One In, One Out&quot; rule to limit any future regulation, Cable agreeing with the need for a &quot;bonfire of regulations&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; dubbed this as &quot;neoliberal&quot; while the response from the business community was largely positive.

In September 2010, during a speech at the Liberal Democrat conference, Cable said that bankers present more of a threat to Britain than trade unions.

After the interim report on banking by John Vickers was published in April 2011, Cable said: &quot;I was very impressed with the quality of the analysis. It does address head on the issue of banks that are too big to fail, the dependency on the government guarantee. It makes the case for separation,&quot; he added.

In June 2011, Cable said &quot;rewards for failure&quot; were unforgivable at a time when real wages were being squeezed across the country. Speaking at the Association of British Insurers biennial conference, Cable warned he planned to bring &quot;excessive and unjustified&quot; executive pay under control by launching a fresh consultation. He said that although &quot;Britain does have some world-class executives&quot;, investors had not seen a return &quot;since the turn of the century&quot; and claimed executive pay was 120 times that of the average UK employee, whereas it was only 45 in 1998. Cable later revealed Government plans that would require companies to publish &quot;more informative remuneration reports&quot; for shareholders. The plans also included binding votes by shareholders on executive pay as well as greater transparency and diversity on boards.

In November 2011, Cable announced the first of several reforms to employment laws. Beginning with changes to the tribunal system, he proposed the introduction of tribunal fees for employees making claims against employers, stating that the current system had become a &quot;major impediment&quot; to small businesses hiring people. The tribunal fees were later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court in 2017 after a court victory by trade union UNISON.

In an article in May 2012, Cable denounced the &quot;red tape factories&quot; of the European Union, calling for increased deregulation and labour market flexibility, as well as the expansion of the Single Market and scrapping of the Working Time Directive. He revealed that at a recent meeting of European economic ministers, a group of like-minded nations had formed in making these same demands.

In September 2012, Cable and his department colleague Michael Fallon announced a large package of deregulation for businesses, including scrapping 3,000 regulations and implementing exemptions from health and safety inspections for shops, pubs, and offices. Cable claimed that businesses should not be &quot;tied up in unnecessary red tape&quot;, but the move was criticised by trade unions. Days later Cable announced further deregulation involving changes to employment laws, proposing to reduce employee compensation for unfair dismissals and allowing employers and employees to agree to an out-of-court &#x27;pay off&#x27; for under-performance dismissals. This was also criticised by trade unions.

In January 2013, Cable rejected calls by Labour for the government to intervene in the high street crisis following the collapse of music retailer, HMV, he said: &quot;it is not the job of Government to sort out the problems of competition on the high street. Consumers make their choices and there are consequences.&quot; In December 2013, Cable supported the continuation of zero hours contracts after a government review, saying &quot;they have a place in today’s labour market&quot;, although admitting there had &quot;been evidence of abuse.&quot; His statements were met with negative responses from British trade unions.

In 2014, during the Israel-Gaza conflict, Cable received criticism for his involvement in the signing off of arms deals to Israel, primarily concerning component parts used in the assembly of Hermes drones. Shortly afterwards, he announced that arms exports to Israel would be suspended unless the recently declared ceasefire was upheld, a response which was condemned by Baroness Warsi, and by the CAAT who called it &quot;very weak&quot;.

In February 2015, Cable was reportedly a speaker at an event hosted by various arms companies at a London hotel.

In 2015, Cable refused to issue export licences for the sale of Paveway IV laser-guided bomb to the Royal Saudi Air Force over concern about how they might be used in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Cable came under pressure from then-Prime Minister David Cameron, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond for the immediate resumption of exports. Cable stated he was then given specific assurances by the Ministry of Defence that the UK would be given oversight of potential bombing targets to minimise the risk of civilian casualties, including involvement in decisions, to a similar level given to the United States. On this understanding, Cable agreed to issue export licences for a £200,000,000 order for the weapons. In 2016, it became apparent the Ministry of Defence did not have this level of oversight, to which Cable responded &quot;That is categorically contrary to what I was told was going to happen.&quot; The sale is being investigated by the Committees on Arms Export Controls.

====December 2010 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; comments====
In late-December 2010, undercover reporters from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, posing as constituents, set up a meeting with Cable, who expressed frustration with being in the coalition and compared it to &quot;fighting a war&quot;; he stated he had &quot;a nuclear option... if they push me too far then I can walk out and bring the government down and they know that&quot;, and had to &quot;pick&quot; his fights carefully. He also claimed the Liberal Democrats had pressed for a &quot;very tough approach&quot; to the UK&#x27;s banks, which had been opposed by the Conservatives. He described the coalition&#x27;s attempt at fast, widespread reforms (including the health service and local governments) as being a &quot;kind of Maoist revolution&quot;, and thought &quot;we [the Government] are trying to do too many things... a lot of it is Tory inspired. The problem is not that they are Tory-inspired, but that they haven’t thought them through. We should be putting a brake on them.&quot; When his comments appeared in the press, Cable stated, &quot;Naturally I am embarrassed by these comments and I regret them&quot;, before reaffirming his commitment to the Coalition Government, stating that &quot;I am proud of what it is achieving&quot;.

In part of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; transcript that it did not disclose, Cable stated in reference to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB, &quot;I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win.&quot; Following this revelation, Cable had his responsibility for media affairs – including ruling on Murdoch&#x27;s takeover plans – withdrawn from his role as Business Secretary. In May 2011, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint regarding the &quot;Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s use of subterfuge.

Cable&#x27;s stature in the Government grew since then, being dubbed &quot;the moral centre of this Coalition&quot; by Peter Oborne, chief political commentator at the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

====Royal Mail sale====
As Business Secretary, Cable oversaw the privatisation of the Royal Mail in 2013. The share price increased by 38% within a day and 70% in a year. The National Audit Office said that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was too cautious when setting the sale price, but that a planned postal workers&#x27; union strike also affected the government&#x27;s sale price. Cable refused to apologise, and said that the Government had been right to take a cautious approach, pointing out that the sale had raised £2,000,000,000 for the taxpayer, with a further £1,500,000,000 from the 30% stake in Royal Mail which it had retained. The NAO also noted that some &quot;priority investors&quot;, had made significant profits following the sale, having been allocated more shares in the belief that they would form part of a stable and supportive shareholder base. However, almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within a few weeks of the sale.

=== Post-ministerial career ===
Cable lost his seat, previously considered safe – with a majority of 12,140 – to the Conservative candidate Tania Mathias at the 2015 general election. Mathias won with a majority of 2,017 votes. Cable&#x27;s elimination from Parliament, combined with the Liberal Democrats&#x27; collective defeat at the election, and the formation of a Conservative majority government obliged him to resign as Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, a position which he held for the majority of its existence. He had also enjoyed the longest tenure as President of the Board of Trade since that of Peter Thorneycroft, which ended in 1957.

===Return to parliament===

Cable announced on 18 April 2017 his intention to stand for his former seat of Twickenham at the snap general election. In May 2017, Cable urged Liberal Democrat supporters to vote tactically for Ealing Central and Acton Labour candidate Rupa Huq. At the election, he was successful in winning back his former seat, with a majority of 9,762 votes.

In a cross-party effort shortly after the election, Cable along with former Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband and veteran Conservative MP Ken Clarke made a joint submission to Ofcom, opposing 21st Century Fox&#x27;s takeover bid of Sky.

Following Tim Farron&#x27;s resignation as leader of the Liberal Democrats, Cable announced his candidacy in the subsequent leadership election.

In July, he called for pro-EU MPs to support and &quot;rally around&quot; Chancellor Philip Hammond.

== Leader of the Liberal Democrats ==
On 20 July 2017, Cable became leader of the Liberal Democrats after facing no competition. He was the oldest leader of a major UK political party since Sir Winston Churchill.

===Policies===
In a manifesto released upon his ascent to leadership, Cable revealed his policy priorities as Liberal Democrat leader would include tackling inequality, improving public services, opposing Brexit, electoral reform and young people.

In late 2017 Cable revealed that he had become &quot;more interventionist&quot; economically due to experiences while in the Coalition government. Subsequently, Cable has called for the blocking of several foreign takeovers of UK companies in the technology sector, and for the reform of UK takeover laws in the form of the &#x27;Cadbury Clause&#x27; that had been suggested by figures within the Conservative Party. Following the leak of the Paradise Papers, Cable commented that direct rule of Crown Dependencies should be threatened if substantial progress was not made in curbing aggressive tax avoidance.

In September 2017 Cable echoed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in calling for greater taxation of foreign speculators in the housing market. He has also called for the reform of empty dwelling management orders.

In an 8 November 2017 pre-Budget speech at the City of London, Cable announced the Liberal Democrats under his leadership would seek to revive the fiscal Golden Rule of former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown.

In early 2018, Cable&#x27;s leadership saw former Conservative donors Peter J Stringfellow and Charlie Mullins switch and pledge their support to Cable and the Liberal Democrats over Brexit.

On education, Cable has rejected cutting or abolishing university tuition fees. He has instead announced that he would seek to implement lifelong learning accounts which would serve as endowments to all young people to help pay for education or training at any future date, and suggested this endowment could range from £5,000 to £10,000 per head (the average university student debt in England is £50,800 upon graduation as of 2017), costing around £10 billion a year. Cable claimed the policy could be funded from reform of capital gains, inheritance, and property taxes. Also on education, he proposes to abolish the Ofsted inspectorate and reform school league tables to focus on pupil well-being rather than exam results because a “change in emphasis” is needed away from competition. He supported the February 2018 USS strikes, calling for the government to underwrite lecturers&#x27; pensions, while refusing to cross a picket line at the Cass Business School.

On 22 March, Cable announced that at an earlier meeting of European liberal parties he had garnered the signed agreements of eight European ALDE Prime Ministers demanding another referendum on the terms of Britain&#x27;s exit from the European Union. Shortly after, however, in contradiction to Cable&#x27;s announcement ALDE issued a statement denying that there had been any joint agreement about backing another referendum.

In June, Cable set out plans to create a state land-buying agency to compulsorily purchase land at 40% below market value. Cable also unveiled a proposal to develop a sovereign wealth fund, totalling £100 billion of assets, to be paid for partly by a tax on gifts.

In response to both the 2017 and 2018 Autumn Budget announcements, Cable called for a large increase in public services spending and the end of austerity, attacking the Conservative government&#x27;s 2018 Autumn Budget for failing to meet his demands on increased spending. He criticised Labour for not voting against a package of Conservative tax cuts which included raising the personal income tax allowance and higher rate income tax threshold, money that he argued would be better used on reversing cuts to benefits.

===Commentary===

Electorally, Cable asserted that the Liberal Democrats under his leadership would win over substantial numbers of younger Labour voters &quot;when the penny drops&quot; about Labour&#x27;s stance on Brexit, and that &quot;young supporters will soon notice&quot;. Aside from Brexit, he claimed that adopting and pitching policies like higher taxation of wealth would also help in winning over Labour voters. Despite this, the Liberal Democrats under Cable&#x27;s leadership drew observations from numerous political commentators such as Stephen Bush of &quot;New Statesman&quot; and John Rentoul of &quot;The Independent&quot; who noted that Liberal Democrat national polling had remained static even with significantly negative public perceptions of both the Labour and Conservative parties. Rentoul, as well as politics historian Glen O&#x27;Hara pointed to traditional and once potential Liberal Democrat voters Cable might wish to target as now having become solidly Labour voters. &quot;The Times&quot; Red Box editor and columnist Matt Chorley, in assessing Cable&#x27;s leadership, wrote how there was already a &quot;grey-haired nasal leftie running an opposition party&quot; (in reference to Jeremy Corbyn) and therefore Cable was not needed.

Cable has received significant critical commentary surrounding his leadership of the Liberal Democrats in terms of policy proposals and stances. In particular, Cable&#x27;s support for a second referendum on membership of the European Union and his comment that older Brexit voters were driven by nostalgia were met with negative reactions from the likes of broadcaster Julia Hartley Brewer, government Cabinet member Sajid Javid, and others. However, some in the media have expressed agreement with Cable&#x27;s position on Brexit. Other policy, such as punitive taxation of foreign housing investors was criticised by the Adam Smith Institute think tank. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; considered Cable to be part of a &quot;coalition of anti-capitalists&quot; due to his calls for foreign takeovers of British companies to be blocked, and in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; his policies were likened unfavourably to those of the Labour Party. Political journalist Andrew Rawnsley of &quot;The Observer&quot; was critical of Cable&#x27;s general approach but conceded the possibility of Cable&#x27;s anti-Brexit policy paying off eventually.

On 7 September 2018, Cable announced his intention to resign as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He initially said he would resign once Brexit has been resolved or stopped, and when his proposed party reforms had been accepted, but in March 2019, he said that he would resign in May 2019 after the local elections. Following the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom, he confirmed on 24 May that he would stand down on 23 July 2019.

==Views==
Cable has compared himself to centrist French President Emmanuel Macron, saying that as Business Secretary he had worked with Macron (then an economy minister) personally and that they have a &quot;very similar&quot; approach. He believes his party should occupy the &quot;vast middle ground&quot;, likening the political conditions of the UK with those of France. Cable asserts that there is an &quot;appetite&quot; for &quot;middle-of-the-road politics&quot; which he claims he can provide, and has decried what he sees as the mistreatment of “middle-of-the-road Brownite type” politicians like Tom Watson by the &quot;hard left&quot; within the Labour Party.

He is a supporter of the Social Liberal Forum, a centre-left group within the Liberal Democrats.

===Trade===

He supported the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership trade agreement (TTIP), saying in 2014 that &quot;if you are a true believer in free trade then you want to trade more with the US.&quot; To critics such as trade unions he replied that he was &quot;genuinely baffled&quot; about their fears that TTIP would lead to the privatisation of the NHS, adding that TTIP had &quot;nothing to do with allowing the Americans to interfere with our NHS&quot;. In 2018, concerning the possibility of US-UK trade deal which might follow the United Kingdom&#x27;s future exit from the European Union, Cable warned that a trade deal in such circumstances might involve agreeing to open up the NHS to private American healthcare firms. Cable claimed this was unlike TTIP in which public services were to remain protected and therefore he argued the UK should remain in the EU. Cable also warned that a post-Brexit trade deal with the US might lead to accepting lower standards in farming produce, less food being produced in the UK and less employment for farmers.

Cable thinks free trade is not a zero-sum game and that it is mutually beneficial for nations, stating: &quot;Countries are better off when they participate in specialisation, with consumers benefiting from greater choice, higher quality products, and lower prices.&quot; He has condemned British and American politicians such as Donald Trump who he claims exploit the &quot;anger and fear&quot; over potential job losses which may result from foreign trade competition.

===Human rights===

In May 2018, Theresa May welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit. Erdoğan declared that the United Kingdom is &quot;an ally and a strategic partner, but also a real friend.&quot; Cable denounced the visit, saying that &quot;The UK has a strong, proud history of democracy and human rights, but our reputation on the world stage is in danger of being eroded by this Conservative government’s desire to woo world leaders like [Donald] Trump and Erdoğan. May’s administration appears to have substituted diplomacy for sycophancy in its pursuit of Brexit.&quot; Cable said that Erdoğan &quot;is responsible for alarming oppression and violence.&quot;

In response to the murder of the Saudi opposition journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Cable said: &quot;This situation gets murkier and murkier. The Government should have already suspended arms export licences to Saudi Arabia given the outrages in Yemen. This reinforces the argument for loosening the bonds to the regime.&quot;

===Taxation and economy===
As an economist, Cable considers Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes to be his heroes, recommending Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and Robert Skidelsky’s &quot;Life of John Maynard Keynes&quot; to novice economists.

He has been a proponent of greater capital spending, or borrowing to invest, and has made the case for this several times during and after the 2010-2015 coalition government.

Cable has called the demutualisation of building societies &quot;one of the greatest acts of economic vandalism in modern times&quot;.

Cable supports the continuation of the Liberal Democrat policy of a hypothecated 1p rise in income tax to pay for improved health and social care,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC9/7/2017&quot;&gt;Brexit may never happen – Sir Vince Cable &quot;BBC&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; along with proposals for replacing national insurance taxes with a likewise hypothecated new NHS and social care tax . He has also voiced support for a wealth tax to raise £15 billion or the equivalent of “less than one-third of 1pc of household wealth, net of debt” which would be used to address “intergenerational inequality.”

Cable has been critical of the National Living Wage (the UK system of minimum wage), arguing in 2015 that smaller businesses would struggle to pay employees higher rates.

He has called for companies Google, Amazon, and Facebook to be broken up, and supports the introduction of a digital services tax on technology companies.

===New party===
Cable has held differing views over time on the possibility of a new party emerging which could involve the Liberal Democrats. After the election of Jeremy Corbyn to the Labour leadership in 2015, Cable called on centre-left MPs from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to unite to prevent the Conservatives holding a “monopoly on power.” He made a similar suggestion in the lead up to the 2017 general election, predicting a new party in the event of Labour undergoing electoral collapse. After becoming leader of the Liberal Democrats, however, he rejected a proposal for a new anti-Brexit party by former government adviser James Chapman, insisting that anti-Brexit figures should join the Liberal Democrats instead.

=== Coalitions and electoral pacts ===
Cable has taken a sceptical approach to the question of potential coalitions with other parties since 2015. In April 2018, he said that the Liberal Democrats would never form a coalition government with Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn, and previously opposed the idea in 2015 as well where he said working with Labour was &quot;inconceivable&quot; because of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s economic policies. Cable claims he would not work with the Conservatives either, comparing a coalition with the Conservatives to &quot;mating with a praying mantis&quot; where &quot;You get eaten at the end of it.&quot; Rather than a coalition or propping up a government, he would prefer to work on &quot;issue-by-issue&quot; instead.

Cable ruled out the idea of electoral pacts in mid-April during the 2017 general election campaign. However, in early May, Cable was recorded suggesting that Liberal Democrat supporters vote for Labour candidates in certain seats where they could stop the Conservatives. Responding to the story on LBC radio, Cable restated that he would not work with Labour and said that the Liberal Democrats had more &quot;common ground&quot; with the Conservatives under David Cameron than with Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. Shortly after, Cable was due to appear and speak at a Compass event in support of a &#x27;progressive alliance&#x27; (a proposed electoral pact between the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats, and Labour) but backed out, stating it was &quot;too late&quot; for a progressive alliance because he couldn&#x27;t work with Labour &quot;in its current form.&quot; He had previously spoken at a progressive alliance event by Compass in 2016.

===Brexit===

In 2017, a year after the Brexit referendum, Cable believed Brexit might still never happen. He maintained that when people saw the economic costs they would turn against it and a cross-party coalition of opponents to Brexit might develop. Cable said, &quot;the whole question of continued membership will once again arise&quot; if people&#x27;s living standards worsened and unemployment rose.

Cable called for cross-border digital services and a single EU market for Netflix.

On 23 June 2018 Cable appeared at the People&#x27;s Vote march in London to mark the second anniversary of the referendum to leave the European Union.In his speech he said, &quot;keep fighting, keep hoping, we will win.&quot;

Cable maintained it &quot;beggars belief that the army and the police are now being asked to prepare for riots in the chaotic aftermath of a botched Brexit. (...) For the &#x27;true believers&#x27; - the fundamentalists - the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant. Years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union. Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it. (...) [Theresa May] is dutifully delivering a policy she doesn&#x27;t really believe in; failing in negotiations; losing public support; and all to appease a dwindling group of angry people in her party who will denounce her as a traitor, whatever she comes up with. (...) Our sympathy can only extend so far, while she puts the interests of the country second to the whims of the extremists in her party.&quot;

===Tuition fees===
In 2017, Cable defended the £9,000 per year university tuition fees cap, claiming it would be &quot;dangerous and stupid&quot; and a &quot;cheap populist gesture&quot; to abolish tuition fees, adding that the &quot;40% of students&quot; who go to university should not be subsidised by the &quot;60% who don&#x27;t&quot;. The comments were criticised on social media by figures on the left, while Conservative MP Jo Johnson voiced support for Cable&#x27;s stance.

===Housing===
On housing, he has backed building on green belts as a solution to the housing crisis. He proposes allowing councils to levy up to a 500% council tax on empty homes.

===The House of Lords===
In 2018, Cable wrote that he had opposed and still opposed the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, for being made up of unaccountable members. However, he expressed his appreciation for the Lords&#x27; &quot;capacity to defeat and embarrass the government&quot; over Brexit legislation, in which he argued the House of Lords were exercising more thorough oversight. Cable declined an offer to be seated in the House of Lords following the 2015 general election.

==Personal life==
Cable&#x27;s first wife was Olympia Rebelo, a Kenyan from a Goan Roman Catholic background, whom he met &quot;in the unromantic setting of a York mental hospital where we happened to be working as nurses during a summer holiday.&quot; They had three children together and she completed her PhD in history at Glasgow University in 1976. Olympia was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after the 1987 general election. After apparently successful treatment, the disease returned in the mid-1990s and before the 1997 general election. She died shortly after the 2001 general election.

In 2004, he married Rachel Wenban Smith. When appearing on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; programme in January 2009, Cable revealed that he wears the wedding rings from both of his marriages.

A keen ballroom dancer, Cable long expressed his desire to appear on the BBC&#x27;s hit television show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;; he appeared on the Christmas 2010 edition of the show, partnered by Erin Boag and dancing the Foxtrot. He performed well and scored 36/40 from the judges, including a mark of 10/10 from head judge Len Goodman. Cable was the second politician to appear on the show, after former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe.

Cable is a patron of MyBigCareer, a career guidance charity for young people, the Polycystic Kidney Disease Charity (PKD), the Changez Charity. and chair of HCT Group, a social enterprise transport operator.

Cable&#x27;s eldest grandson is social activist and entrepreneur Ayrton Cable.

Cable revealed that he had a minor stroke while leader of the Liberal Democrats in his memoir. The stroke occurred in May 2018.

==Honours==
* He was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 2010 upon his appointment as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and President of the Board of Trade in the coalition government. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* In David Cameron’s 2015 Dissolution Honours, Cable was appointed a Knight Bachelor for political and public service.

<text>Sir Sydney Brookes Chapman (17 October 1935 – 9 October 2014) was a British Conservative politician and architect who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Handsworth and Chipping Barnet.

==Life==
Chapman was educated at Rugby School and Manchester University, where he studied architecture, gaining his Diploma in 1958 and ARIBA in 1960. He was Chairman of the Young Conservatives from 1964 to 1966.

He married his first wife, Claire in 1976 (she was also his secretary when he was an MP), and they had three children. In 2005, he married his second wife, Teresa at Chelsea Town Hall.

After his retirement from politics, he moved from Barnet to Oxfordshire.
He was a vice-chairman of the Council of Christians and Jews and on the Council of the Royal Institute of British Architects for 2009–2012.

Chapman died on 9 October 2014 in Oxfordshire. A Service of Thanksgiving was organised by his family on 10 June 2015 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster. Attended by some 400 people including family, former colleagues, friends and constituents, the eulogies were read by Lord Ryder, Philip Porter and Chapman&#x27;s sister, Cllr Christine Bateson.

==Political career==
Chapman first stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, at Stalybridge and Hyde at the 1964 election, but was defeated by the incumbent Labour MP Fred Blackburn.

He was first elected to Parliament in 1970 as MP for Birmingham Handsworth, but lost his seat when Labour returned to power at the February 1974 general election. During this period he was notable for &quot;Plant A Tree In &#x27;73&quot;, an initiative which had the support of Edward Heath&#x27;s government and led to the formation of The Tree Council.

Five years later, at the 1979 election, Chapman was returned as MP for Chipping Barnet. The seat had previously been vacant, following the death of incumbent MP, former cabinet minister Reginald Maudling, three months before the election. He was briefly a whip during John Major&#x27;s administration, one of his principal tasks being to provide Queen Elizabeth II with daily reports of Parliamentary proceedings. His conscientious attention to this role led to his being knighted in 1995. Chapman was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1997 to 2005.

==Local achievements==
In the late 1980s, following the death of a horse rider crossing the A1 trunk road in Arkley, Chapman championed the campaign to have a bridge put in for walkers, riders and cyclists&#x27; use. This campaign was successful, and the bridge opened in 1991. In recognition of his work, he was presented with an award by the British Horse Society&#x27;s President at the bridge&#x27;s official opening ceremony.

<text>Patrick Thomas Cormack, Baron Cormack, (18 May 1939 – 25 February 2024) was a British politician, historian, journalist and author. He served as a member of Parliament (MP) for 40 years, from 1970 to 2010. Cormack was a member of the Conservative Party and was seen as a one-nation conservative.

Before entering Parliament, Cormack was a teacher. He was elected for Cannock at the 1970 general election. Following boundary changes he was elected for South West Staffordshire in 1974, renamed South Staffordshire in 1983. He was elected chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee in 2005. He was also twice a candidate for the speakership of the House of Commons. After standing down from the House of Commons in 2010, he served as an active life peer in the House of Lords.

==Early life and career==
Cormack was born to Thomas Charles Cormack, a local government officer and master mariner, and his wife Kathleen Mary Cormack in Grimsby just before the outbreak of the Second World War. He was educated locally at the St James&#x27;s Choir School and the Havelock School, before attending the University of Hull, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961.

Cormack was a teacher at his former school, St James&#x27;s Choir School, in 1961. Cormack contested the safe Labour parliamentary seat of Bolsover at the 1964 general election, where he lost to the sitting MP Harold Neal, who won with a majority of 23,103 votes. At the 1966 general election, Cormack contested his hometown seat of Grimsby, but again was defeated, this time by the secretary of state for education and science, Anthony Crosland, who had a majority of 8,126. Cormack became a training and education officer with Ross Ltd in 1966. In 1967, he was appointed an assistant house master at the Wrekin College in Wellington, Shropshire, for two years, after which he became the head of history at Brewood Grammar School in 1969.

Prior to 1970, Cormack was a member of the Bow Group and the Conservative Monday Club, resigning from both at the end of 1971.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1970 general election, Cormack stood for the seat of Cannock, and this time was elected, narrowly defeating the incumbent Labour MP Jennie Lee. Cormack won with a majority of 1,529.

From 1970 to 1973, Cormack served as a parliamentary private secretary at the Department of Health and Social Security. He moved constituencies at the February 1974 general election, leaving the marginal seat of Cannock and instead contesting the adjacent newly drawn seat of South West Staffordshire, which he won comfortably with a majority of 9,758.

Cormack became chairman of the editorial board of &quot;The House&quot; magazine in 1976, and editor of the magazine in 1979.

Cormack was a member of the Education Select Committee for the duration of the 1979–83 Parliament.

An opponent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s monetarist economic policies, in November 1981, with national unemployment approaching 3,000,000 (compared to 1,500,000 two years previously), Cormack urged Thatcher to change her government&#x27;s policies if Britain was to avoid economic disaster.

In the 1983 general election, Cormack was elected to the renamed seat of South Staffordshire, covering a similar area to the former South West Staffordshire seat. In 1997, after 27 years as an MP on the backbenches, he was promoted by the then leader of the Opposition, William Hague, to become the opposition&#x27;s Deputy Leader of the House of Commons.

Cormack resigned from this position in early 2000, standing later that year for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons (following the retirement of Betty Boothroyd). However, he was unsuccessful in his bid for the speakership, with the House instead choosing Labour MP Michael Martin for the role. Cormack became life president of &quot;The House&quot; magazine in 2005. During the 2005–10 parliament, Cormack was the chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee.

The vote in South Staffordshire was postponed at the 2005 general election due to the death of the Liberal Democrat candidate Jo Harrison. When the election did take place on 23 June 2005, Cormack won comfortably. In February 2007, it was announced that Cormack had failed to win the re-adoption of his constituency party for the next general election. This vote was later declared invalid, for the number of votes recorded exceeded the number of people present at the meeting. In July 2007, the South Staffordshire Conservatives&#x27; executive council voted on the matter, but it resulted in a tie. Consequently, a vote of all local party members was held to decide whether Cormack should remain the party&#x27;s candidate at the following general election. In the vote, held on 14 September, Cormack was readopted as the Conservative candidate, receiving the backing of over 75% of participating party members. Cormack expressed his gratitude and called the victory a &quot;great relief&quot;. Subsequently, on 1 December 2009, Cormack announced his intention to stand down at the 2010 general election.

Although having a reputation as a serious parliamentarian, on occasions he was known for asking light hearted questions in the House of Commons, once simply asking Prime Minister Gordon Brown at PMQ&#x27;s what he wanted for Christmas.

Cormack was created a life peer on 18 December 2010, as &quot;Baron Cormack&quot;, &quot;of Enville in the County of Staffordshire&quot;. He sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. Cormack opposed the Coalition&#x27;s plans to reform the House of Lords, speaking out against them numerous times in the chamber.

Cormack was seen as a One Nation Tory. He was a Heathite, and was a frequent rebel under Margaret Thatcher – one of the so-called &quot;wets&quot;.

==Other interests==
Cormack took an active interest in historical issues, particularly those related to English Heritage. He was also a knowledgeable Parliamentary historian. He wrote many books on subjects ranging from the history of Parliament, British castles, English cathedrals, and a book on William Wilberforce.

Cormack was a trustee of the Churches Preservation Trust from 1972 until his death. He was a council member of British Archaeology since 1979, and was also a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass for the same length of time. From 1983 to 1993, he was Trustee on the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust. He was a consultant and adviser to FIRST, an international affairs organisation, since 1985. He was a vice-president of the Royal Stuart Society and the Heritage Crafts Association.

A committed Christian, Cormack was a rector&#x27;s warden at Parliament&#x27;s parish church, St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, from 1978 to 1990.

Cormack served as president of the British Association of Friends of Museums from 2023 until his death in 2024.

Cormack was a longstanding Vice President of the National Churches Trust.

Cormack was President of the Prayer Book Society for many years

==Personal life and death==
Cormack married Kathleen Mary MacDonald in 1967. They had two sons. He listed his recreations in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; as &quot;fighting philistines, walking, visiting old churches, avoiding sitting on fences&quot;. He was a member of the Athenaeum and Lincolnshire clubs. He was a longtime resident of Lincoln, living near its famed cathedral. 

Cormack died on 25 February 2024, at the age of 84. Among those who paid tribute to him were Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer.

<text>Francis Anthony Aylmer Maude, Baron Maude of Horsham, (born 4 July 1953) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General from 2010 to 2015. He also served in several posts while the Conservatives were in opposition, notably as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Shadow Foreign Secretary and Chairman of the Conservative Party. Maude was Member of Parliament (MP) for North Warwickshire from 1983 to 1992 and then for Horsham from 1997 to 2015.

Having served over 25 years on the frontbench in the House of Commons, he stepped down at the 2015 general election and became a life peer. He served as Minister of State for Trade and Investment from 2015 to 2016, before stepping down from government service to run his own business; Francis Maude Associates, or FMA, a consultancy specialising in government efficiency.

==Early life==

Maude is the son of Angus Maude (1912–1993), a life peer and one-time Conservative cabinet minister. He spent part of his childhood in Sydney, Australia, while his father edited &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. On the family&#x27;s return to the UK, he was educated at Abingdon School, at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and at the College of Law. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1977, and practised criminal law. He served as a member of Westminster City Council from 1978 to 1984.

==Political career==

===In government, 1983–1992===
Maude was first elected to the House of Commons to represent the constituency of North Warwickshire in the Conservative Party&#x27;s landslide victory at the 1983 general election. In 1984, he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Employment Peter Morrison. Maude then became an assistant government whip (1985–87) and Minister for Corporate and Consumer Affairs (1987–89), then part of the DTI. A Thatcherite, Maude was appointed in 1989 the Minister for Europe in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to spearhead the policy outlined in the Bruges Speech, attacking the Delors Plan in order to exclude Britain from an economic and political Union of Europe. In 1992 he acted as deputy for Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont and was one of the two UK signatories to the Maastricht Treaty.

Maude was one of the first &quot;men in grey suits&quot; to hold discussions with Margaret Thatcher in November 1990 after she failed to win the first round of a leadership election. He told Thatcher that he would support her as long as she went on, but he did not believe she could win the leadership contest.

After John Major became prime minister, Maude was made the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. However, in the 1992 general election he lost his seat to the Labour Party candidate, Mike O&#x27;Brien, and was thus forced to vacate his ministerial roles. According to Daniel Finkelstein of &quot;The Times&quot; the loss came as a &#x27;terrible blow&#x27; to Maude; all his peers had managed to cling on and were together forming a government. In the Dissolution Honours that year, he was made a member of the Privy Council.

In a 2006 interview, Maude stated that the introduction of Section 28 legislation whilst he was in Government (which banned Councils from promoting homosexuality and led to the closure of gay support groups) was &quot;a mistake&quot;, adding it might have even contributed to the AIDS death of his brother Charles, who was homosexual, among others. In 2012 he expanded further on his views on Section 28, saying &quot;in hindsight, it was very wrong — very wrong. It was a legislative provision that came out of honourable motives. It took me some time to realise what an emblem of intolerance Section 28 had become for gay people. It was the tip of a deep iceberg — the iceberg below the surface being a host of anti-gay social attitudes.&quot;

===Out of Parliament, 1992–1997===
Out of Parliament after the 1992 general election, Maude began a series of business roles. He worked in banking as managing director at Morgan Stanley from 1993 to 1997. He was also appointed a non-executive director of ASDA Group plc in July 1992, and served as a director of Salomon Brothers from 1992 to 1993. He also chaired the government&#x27;s Deregulation Task Force from 1994 to 1997. This was preparation as Cabinet Office Minister from 2010, when he was required to highlight areas of expenditure where savings could be made from streamlining the delivery and implementation of policy goals.

===Shadow Cabinet, 1997–2010===
In the 1997 general election Maude was elected MP for Horsham. Almost immediately he was re-appointed to the Conservative front bench, now the opposition in Parliament. He served as Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Shadow Foreign Secretary until 2001.

Maude managed Michael Portillo&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the Conservative leadership in 2001, after which he declined a front bench role under the new Party Leader Iain Duncan Smith. He was considered to be a &#x27;moderniser&#x27; and on the centre-left of the party, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (24 June 2002), he said that the Conservative Party&#x27;s electoral problems had been caused by its failure to &quot;look and sound like modern Britain&quot;. Norman Tebbit&#x27;s secretary, Beryl Goldsmith, criticised Maude after this, asking: Outside the Shadow Cabinet, Maude founded Conservatives for Change, &quot;CChange&quot;, becoming its first chairman. &quot;CChange&quot; was designed to promote the modernisation of the Conservative Party. Around the same point he also founded Policy Exchange.

Following the 2005 general election, Maude returned to the Shadow Cabinet as Chairman of the Conservative Party. As the so-called Holy Spirit of Conservative modernisation, Maude set the Tory Party on the path to reform which saw David Cameron selected as Party Leader. In his first speech to the Conservative Conference as Party Chairman, Maude presented what he calls his &quot;killer slide&quot;. The slide revealed that &quot;voters confronted with the party’s immigration policy neutrally supported it by two to one, but when told that it was a Conservative policy the proportions reversed&quot;. The point he was making was not that sound conservative ideas damaged the Conservative Party but that &#x27;The Conservative Party, as it was then seen, was damaging good Conservative policies&quot;. During his tenure, alongside newly elected Leader David Cameron, the Conservatives adopted the A-List of parliamentary candidates, with priority being given to women and people from ethnic minorities.

In July 2007, Maude was made Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office and Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with responsibility for preparing the Conservatives for government, with some dubbing him the Party&#x27;s &quot;enforcer&quot;. At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2007 he said: &quot;David (Cameron) has asked me to lead an implementation team that will ensure that we are as well-prepared as any incoming government has ever been. Our priorities rigorously sorted. Our teams armed with the knowledge and capabilities that will enable new ministers to start making a difference from day one.&quot; Ahead of the 2010 general election, Maude led attempts by the then-Conservative Opposition to work with the UK Civil Service to prepare for government.

Maude supported Republican John McCain in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. He led the Conservative Party delegation to the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

===Return to Government, 2010–2016===

Maude was appointed Paymaster General and Minister for the Cabinet Office, with the right to attend Cabinet, on 12 May 2010, following the formation of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition. As Cabinet Office Minister, Maude was responsible for: public service efficiency and reform groups, Civil Service issues, industrial relations strategy in the public sector, transparency, civil contingencies, civil society and cyber-security.

====Efficiency and Reform====

In 2010 Maude set up the Efficiency and Reform Group (ERG), in the Cabinet Office to work with HM Treasury with the aim of making government departments more efficient. This work includes stopping wasteful spending; improving the way government buys goods and services; reducing losses from fraud, error and debt; raising money by selling empty buildings and underused properties; and reviewing and reshaping large scale projects.

Savings are difficult to measure, but the work of ERG claims to have contributed to £3.75 billion of savings in 2010–11, £5.5 billion in 2011–12 and an &quot;unprecedented&quot; £10 billion in 2012–13. ERG claims to achieve savings of at least £20 billion in the financial year 2014 to 2015. Cumulatively, by 2015 Maude had delivered more than £50 billion of audited savings during the Cameron–Clegg coalition government.

These savings included include £3.4 billion by reducing the size of the Civil Service and reforming Civil Service pensions; £3.8 billion by linking together departments to buy goods and services and enforcing controls on recruitment and use of consultants; and £0.6 billion by exiting 500,000 square metres of property. In December 2014 Francis Maude set out plans to make a further £10 billion of efficiency savings between 2017 and 2018 and an additional £15 to £20 billion for 2019 to 2020.

====Civil Service reform====
In June 2012 Maude laid out his plans for reforming the Civil Service. The Reform programme was endorsed by leadership of the Civil Service, the Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service. The document laid out a series of practical actions including steps to improve the skills, abilities and performance of civil servants; introduce a sharper performance management system; create a modern employment offer for staff; improve IT and flexible working across departments; and tighten the delivery of major projects. A year after the publication of the initial plan, Maude updated Parliament with a One Year On document, setting out successes and failures. This document included various further steps: establishing the principle of Extended Ministerial Offices, and introducing Functional Leadership across Whitehall. However, in November 2013, former Cabinet secretary Lord Butler of Brockwell told the BBC that &quot;Mr Maude and some of his colleagues don&#x27;t understand leadership.&quot; Butler said the relationship between ministers and the Civil Service worked best when there was loyalty on both side and public criticism showed something was wrong. A spokesman for Maude said good leadership required issues to be addressed, not swept under the carpet.

====Transparency====
Maude oversaw the Government&#x27;s groundbreaking transparency policy. This work includes making sure that departments include specific open data commitments in their business plans, regularly publishing open data sets on all central and local government spending over £25,000, senior staff salary details and how the government is performing against objectives. Data.gov.uk contains over 9,000 datasets including local crime statistics, sentencing rates, hospital infection rates and GP performance.

Maude also led the UK Government&#x27;s work with the Open Government Partnership. This work helped make the British government the most open in the world at the time, and led directly to the creation of services such as the Citymapper app and challenger banks like Monzo.

Following Maude&#x27;s reforms the United Nations rated the UK government as the most open in world.

====Government Digital Service and GOV.UK====
Maude was responsible for the creation of the Government Digital Service, with the aim to consolidate internal IT and replace government 1,700 various websites with a single web hub, gov.uk. The new consolidated website won Design of the Year 2013 at the Design Museum awards, beating The Shard and the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron. Its revolutionary single source model inspired government websites around the world, including in the United States, New Zealand and Australia.

The Government Digital Strategy also committed Departments to redesigning all existing government services that serve more than 100,000 users each year. Maude&#x27;s office estimated that moving services from offline to digital channels could save approximately £1.8 billion a year; at the time digital transactions cost 20 pence each compared to £3 for a phone call and £7 for a physical letter.
In June 2014 Maude warned that elderly people would have to apply for key benefits including Carer&#x27;s Allowance online. His remarks were criticized by organizations who work with the elderly partly on the grounds that poorer people may not be able to afford computer facilities and, partly because even computer literate people may lose their skills in old age. Whilst critics estimated that over 5 million pensioners have never used the internet, Maude said that &#x27;refuseniks&#x27; could be offered a one-off lesson.

==== Elevation to the Lords ====
In February 2015, Maude announced he would be standing down at the general election three months later. Following the election, on 14 May 2015 Maude was elevated to the House of Lords and he was created, by letters patent, Baron Maude of Horsham, &quot;of Shipley in the County of West Sussex&quot; on 26 May 2015. This allowed him to be appointed as Minister of State for Trade and Investment jointly at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, replacing Lord Livingston of Parkhead. Nine months later, Maude announced his resignation from this post on 10 February 2016, to be replaced by Mark Price.

==Career outside of Parliament: 2016–present==

Since leaving his role as Minister for Trade and Investment in March 2016, Maude has begun a number of new business roles, including serving as an advisory board member at OakNorth Bank which deals with business and property finance, and specialises in supporting the UK&#x27;s growth businesses since September 2016. He has been an advisory board member at Anvest Partners, a real estate investment company since May 2016, and a Senior Adviser with Covington &amp; Burling LLP, a business and corporate law firm since November 2016. He has also been a Non Executive Chairman at Cogent Elliott Group Ltd, an advertising agency, since November 2016.

Maude&#x27;s primary occupation since leaving politics is his role as the co-founder and chairman of Francis Maude Associates, which he runs with his former special advisor Simone Finn, Baroness Finn. It is a consulting firm specialising in government efficiency and reform around the world, with its work based on Maude&#x27;s experience as Minister for the Cabinet Office.

Following the resignation of Dominic Raab, Lord Maude suggested the UK Civil Service should alter its rules on impartiality and continuity under different governments.

Lord Maude endorsed the campaign of Kemi Badenoch in the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election.

==Controversies==

While in the Shadow Cabinet, Maude was accused of hypocrisy by Oliver Marre in the Guardian for promoting a &quot;family-friendly&quot; image while being the non-executive chairman of Jubilee Investment Trust plc, which held 21% of American pornographic actress Jill Kelly&#x27;s adult DVD business, and chairman of the Mission Marketing Group, which has advertised for WKD drinks and Playboy. Maude, &quot;who has railed against irresponsible lending by banks and mortgage companies&quot;, was accused of hypocrisy for receiving more than £100,000 as a director of a company that has profited from sub-prime mortgages. His annual salary was £25,000 from 2002 to 2005, for attending around six meetings a year for the company, and £12,000 a year 2006 to 2008. The company went into liquidation in April 2009.

Maude faced criticism during the expenses scandal. However the Legg Report made no complaint against him and found that he had &quot;no issues&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; had argued that two years after the Fees Office rejected a claim for mortgage interest on Maude&#x27;s Sussex home, Maude purchased a flat in London, close to another house he already owned. He rented out the London house and claimed £35,000 mortgage interest on this flat.

During a discussion on &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 22 October 2010 Maude stated that ministerial salaries had been reduced by 5% under the new Government. He was accused of comparing this cut to the &#x27;pain&#x27; suffered by Britain&#x27;s poor.

===Fuel crisis===

On 28 March 2012, during the 2012 United Kingdom fuel crisis, Maude advised people to fill up their vehicles and to store fuel in garages in jerrycans. His remarks were widely criticised, queues up to half a mile long formed outside petrol stations and petrol retailers criticised the Government for causing panic. Matt Wrack, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union said that Maude&#x27;s advice was dangerous and illegal, and could be disastrous in the event of a fire. Brian Madderson, the petrol chairman of the Retail Motor Industry Federation said that the Government appeared to be &quot;intent on creating a crisis out of a serious concern and that drivers should ignore &quot;dangerous advice&quot;. Maude denied that it would increase the risk of explosions, however the following day Transport Minister Mike Penning, a former firefighter, confirmed the advice was wrong, saying he did not think Maude understood how big jerrycans were. On 30 March 2012, the Labour Peer Lord Harris called for Maude&#x27;s resignation, after a woman suffered severe burns during an attempt to decant petrol next to a lit gas cooker. Harris believed that Maude&#x27;s advice helped cause the incident.

==Personal life==
Maude married Christina Jane Hadfield in 1984, and they have five children. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1988 to 2006 and was Chairman of the Governors from 1995 to 2003.

<text>is a Japanese food manufacturer. Its main products and services include soy sauce, food seasoning and flavoring, mirin, , and sake, juice and other beverages, pharmaceuticals, and restaurant management services. As of 2002, the company was the world&#x27;s largest producer of soy sauce. As of 2024, the company&#x27;s motto is &quot;To promote the international exchange of food culture.&quot;

As of 2002, Kikkoman has production facilities in Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Taiwan; additional facilities have been reported in China and Canada. Kikkoman is the most popular brand of soy sauce in Japan and the United States. The city of Düsseldorf, Germany, is the European headquarters of the company. A plant in Sappemeer, Netherlands, began operations in 1997 and now produces over 400 million litres of soy sauce per year.

==History==

West Japanese-style soy sauce, called , has been a well-known condiment for over 300 years. Kikkoman is the largest manufacturing company in the world, and &quot;the one most responsible for introducing to the West&quot;.

Founded contemporarily in 1917 in Noda, with the merger of eight family-owned companies. Those companies were founded as early as 1603 by the Mogi and Takanashi families. Kikkoman was originally known as the &quot;Noda Shoyu Corporation&quot; before 1940, when they adopted a single nationwide brand name.

==Operations==
As of 2002, the firm had five main divisions:

* soy sauce
* soy sauce-related products
* wine and liquor
* Del Monte products
* biotechnology

=== Services ===
As of 2002, the company owned and operated several secondary service organizations, among them being:

* the Colza restaurant chain
* the Nakanakaya pub chain
* a Tokyo city wine garden

=== Products ===
According to a 2002 source, products produced beyond those described in sections below:

* Mann&#x27;s Wine, a major Japanese label
* brown rice (Del Monte brand)
* luciferase, among other biotechnology-relate products

===Soy sauce===
Kikkoman soy sauce is produced using a traditional method of natural brewing. The process begins with soaking soybeans in water and then steaming them at high temperatures. These soybeans are mixed with crushed roasted wheat. Salt is added as an anti-bacterial agent and preservative. A type of the &quot;Aspergillus&quot; fungus is introduced to the mixture for three days to create , the base for the soy sauce. This base is then transferred to a tank and mixed with a saline solution, forming a mash known as . The mixture undergoes several months of aging, allowing for various fermentation processes that develop the flavors. The is mechanically pressed through fabric layers for about ten hours to extract the raw soy sauce.

The raw soy sauce is left to settle for 3–4 days and then pasteurized using steam, which stops enzymatic activity. The final product is then inspected and bottled. Kikkoman&#x27;s soy sauce bottle was designed by Kenji Ekuan in 1961.

===Soy milk===
Kikkoman produces soy milk using selected soybeans and methods aimed at ensuring product freshness. The company offers a range of soymilk products. Kikkoman Soy milk is a leading brand in Japan and began expanding internationally in 2018, providing products to the Asia and Oceania regions.

===Tomato juice and ketchup===
Kikkoman started producing tomato juice and ketchup in 1962. The plant in Gunma focuses on tomato seasonings, while the Nagano plant specializes in beverages. In August 2013, Kikkoman launched the &quot;Lycopene Rich&quot; tomato ketchup, made with ripe tomatoes. This product line includes tomato sauce, puree, pizza sauce, and tomato beverages. The Nippon Del Monte Agri Company, established in 2013, focuses on the production and sales of fresh tomatoes and vegetable seedlings. The company has increased harvest yields by incorporating advanced technology from the Netherlands and optimizing farming methods for Japan.

<text>The  (), Noldorin for &quot;account of tongues&quot;, is a work of fictional sociolinguistics, written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937, and published in the 1987 &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;, volume five of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; series.

Tolkien, a philologist, became fascinated by constructed languages, and invented stories to provide his languages with a suitable world, Middle-earth. This resulted in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. He peopled Middle-earth with Elves and other races, and in the presented the theory that all Middle-earth&#x27;s languages had a shared origin. In the document, he diagrammed the resulting &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot; and described the fictional history of the evolution of some 30 Elvish languages. 

Scholars have noted the realism of Tolkien&#x27;s family of Elvish languages, analogous to the Indo-European family, as well as his changing views of their linguistic history, which he shifted radically soon after creating the . The result was that the Noldorin language described in the document and in the contemporaneous &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, soon became the Sindarin found in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, while the new Noldorin became just a dialect of Quenya; Tolkien redrew his &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot; accordingly.

== Context ==

=== Tolkien&#x27;s philology ===

From his schooldays, J. R. R. Tolkien was in his biographer John Garth&#x27;s words &quot;effusive about philology&quot;; his schoolfriend Rob Gilson called him &quot;quite a great authority on etymology&quot;. Tolkien was a professional philologist, a scholar of comparative and historical linguistics. He was especially familiar with Old English and related languages. He remarked to the poet and &quot;The New York Times&quot; book reviewer Harvey Breit that &quot;I am a philologist and all my work is philological&quot;; he explained to his American publisher Houghton Mifflin that this was meant to imply that his work was 

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes that 

In other words, Flieger writes, Tolkien &quot;did not keep his knowledge in compartments; his scholarly expertise informs his creative work.&quot; This expertise was founded, in her view, on the belief that one knows a text only by &quot;properly understanding [its] words, their literal meaning and their historical development.&quot;

=== Middle-earth ===

Tolkien is best known as the author of the high fantasy works &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, both set in Middle-earth. He created a family of invented languages for Elves, carefully designing the differences between them to reflect their distance from their imaginary common origin. He stated that his languages led him to create the invented mythology of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, to provide a world in which his languages could have existed. In that world, the splintering of the Elvish peoples mirrored the fragmentation of their languages.

== Text ==

The was written in 1937. It exists in three versions. The two long versions, A and B, are closely similar, so Christopher Tolkien published B in &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;, annotating it with A&#x27;s minor variations on the text. The third, latest, and much the shortest version is the .

=== Theory of Middle-earth languages ===

The as published presents the theory that all the languages of Middle-earth descend from the language of the angelic beings or Valar, Valarin, and were divided into three branches:

* Oromëan, named after Oromë, who taught the first Elves to speak. All languages of Elves and most languages of Men are Oromëan.
* Aulëan, named after Aulë, maker of the Dwarves, is the origin of the Khuzdul language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men.
* Melkian, named after the rebellious Melkor or Morgoth, is the origin in the First Age of the many tongues used by the Orcs and other evil beings. (This tongue is unrelated to the Black Speech of Sauron.)


The Elves developed the language they were taught into the language of the Laiquendi (Green-Elves) and Eldarin, the shared language of the Eldar. This in turn gave rise to the languages of the three divisions of the Eldar, Lindarin, Noldorin, and Telerin. What Tolkien called &#x27;Elf-Latin&#x27;, Qenya, the classical and ancient language of the Eldar, derived from Lindarin with influence from Noldorin.

=== &quot;Ósanwe-kenta&quot; ===

The , or &quot;Enquiry into the Communication of Thought&quot;, was written as a typescript of eight pages, probably in 1960, and was first published in (39) in 1998. Within its fictional context, a frame story, the text is presented as a summary by an unnamed editor of the last chapter of the . The subject-matter is &quot;direct thought-transmission&quot; (telepathy), or &quot;thought-opening&quot; in Quenya. Pengolodh included it as last chapter to the Lhammas because of the implications of spoken language on thought-transmission, and since the Incarnates (Elves, and Men) use a spoken language, telepathy can become more difficult with time (cf. hröa).

== Analysis == 

=== Frame story ===

Tolkien later revised the internal history of the Elvish languages, stating that the Elves were capable of constructing their own languages, but did not update the to be coherent with this. The essay as it stands in &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; can be thus seen as an interpolated manuscript, badly translated by Men in the Fourth Age or even later: &quot;For many thousands of years have passed since the fall of Gondolin.&quot; In Tolkien&#x27;s frame story, no autograph manuscripts of the of Pengolodh remained; the three surviving manuscripts came from the original manuscript through an unknown number of intermediate copies. A tradition of philological study of Elvish languages exists within the fiction; Tolkien mentions that &quot;The older stages of Quenya were, and doubtless still are, known to the loremasters of the Eldar. It appears from these notices that besides certain ancient songs and compilations of lore that were orally preserved, there existed also some books and many ancient inscriptions.&quot;

=== Realistic language family ===

The and related writings like &quot;The Etymologies&quot; illustrate Tolkien&#x27;s conception of the languages of Middle-earth as a language family analogous to Indo-European, with diverging branches and sub-branches — though for the immortal Elves the proto-language is remembered rather than reconstructed. This &quot;concept of increasing separation&quot; was also employed for the Sundering of the Elves in Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium.
The indicates on Tolkien&#x27;s diagrams of the &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot; that there were at various times some thirty Elvish languages and dialects.

=== Changing views of Elvish linguistic history ===

After he had written the contemporaneous and &quot;The Etymologies&quot; (also published in &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;), Tolkien decided to make Sindarin the major language of the Elves in exile in Beleriand. As such, it largely replaced Noldorin; eventually Tolkien settled on the explanation that after the Noldor returned to Beleriand from Valinor, they adopted the language used by the Sindar (Grey Elves) already settled there. The thus represents a stage in Tolkien&#x27;s development of his Elvish languages (and of the Silmarillion legendarium), documented also in &quot;The Etymologies&quot; and an essay, &quot;The Feanorian Alphabet&quot;.

Bill Welden, writing in &quot;Arda Philology&quot;, comments that &quot;the High-elven tongue of the Noldor&quot;, mentioned by the Tolkienesque character Faramir in a draft of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, sounds, and looks from the &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot; in the , as if it must be Quenya &quot;as we would expect&quot;. But, Welden writes, it&#x27;s actually &quot;almost exactly&quot; Sindarin, which Tolkien derived from Welsh. Further, the version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; that he submitted to his publisher relied on &quot;pretty much&quot; the same conception of the Elvish language family, with Noldorin instead of Sindarin as the language of Gondor. Tolkien tried several schemes to make the change to Sindarin work in terms of rates of linguistic change. Because the Noldor&#x27;s use of Sindarin was rather sudden, he settled on a radically new scheme: when the Noldor arrived back in Middle-earth from Valinor, they adopted the native language of Beleriand where they settled. The Elves of Beleriand were Sindar, Silvan Elves who had never gone to Valinor. The Noldor had been speaking Noldorin, a dialect of the ancient language of Quenya, and it had changed little, unlike Sindarin. The and &quot;The Etymologies&quot; had been describing Sindarin (but calling it Noldorin). Tolkien hastened to redraw the &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot;, in a version recorded in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; 18, to accommodate this restructuring.

<text>William Michael Hardy Spicer, Baron Spicer, (22 January 1943 – 29 May 2019) was a British politician and life peer who was a Conservative member of the House of Lords from 2010 until 2019. He served as Member of Parliament for West Worcestershire from 1974 to 2010 and was a minister from 1984 to 1990. He later served as chairman of the 1922 Committee from 2001 to 2010.

==Early life==
He was born in Bath, Somerset, to Lt. Col. (later Brigadier) Leslie Hardy Spicer and Muriel, daughter of Wallis G. Carter of Bath. Spicer was educated in Vienna, at Gaunts House Preparatory School and Wellington College, and received a degree in economics from Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After graduation, he worked as a financial journalist for &quot;The Statist&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He was Director of Conservative Systems Research Centre from 1968 to 1970, and managing director of Economic Models Ltd from 1970 to 1980.

==Parliamentary career==
Spicer joined the Conservative Party, and at the 1966 general election, he challenged Manny Shinwell in the safe Labour Easington constituency as the youngest parliamentary candidate in the country against the eldest. He stood in Easington again at the 1970 general election before he was elected at the February 1974 general election for South Worcestershire. He represented South Worcestershire until 1997. When boundary changes abolished the constituency; he then moved to the West Worcestershire seat, which he represented until his retirement from the Commons.

After the 1979 general election, which swept the Conservatives to power, he became a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department of Trade. He was later made a Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party. He became a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Transport in 1984 and served until 1987 with specific responsibility for aviation.

In 1987, he moved to the Department of Energy, again as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary, this time with responsibility for electricity and coal. In January 1990, he was promoted to become a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, but after the ousting of Margaret Thatcher in November 1990, he left the government payroll over his opposition to British participation in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.

On leaving the government, he became the chairman of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee in the House of Commons. In 1993, he founded the eurosceptic European Research Group within the Conservative Party.
In the 1996 New Year Honours he received a knighthood, with the honour conferred by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 February 1996. After the 1997 general election he became a member of the Treasury Select Committee.

He was an author and had a number of books published, including &quot;The Spicer Diaries&quot;.

His majority declined in 1997 in keeping with the general trend across the country, but he kept his seat which had become West Worcestershire after boundary changes that year. His majority almost doubled four years later, at the 2001 general election. However, unlike most other Conservative MPs, he failed to increase his majority in 2005; instead, it was more than halved, and he held one of the Conservatives&#x27; most marginal seats against the Liberal Democrats.

Following the 2001 general election, Spicer was elected Chairman of the 1922 Committee, a position that he held until he stood down in 2010.

As chairman of the 1922 Committee, he had the distinction of presiding over more leadership elections than any of his predecessors since Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and David Cameron were all elected during his tenure. This record has now been surpassed by Graham Brady.

In the Commons, he became known for asking short questions, usually of one-sentence questions to government ministers and at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions and once simply asking Gordon Brown, &quot;Will the Prime Minister confirm that he will soldier on to the bitter end?&quot; On another occasion, he asked Brown, &quot;Why are there always so many strikes at the end of a Labour government?&quot;

On 26 March 2006, Spicer announced that he would not contest the Worcestershire West seat at the 2010 election and that he would retire as an MP.

==Later life==
He was created a life peer on 8 July 2010 as Baron Spicer, of Cropthorne in the County of Worcestershire.

He was sworn of the Privy Council on 15 May 2013 at Buckingham Palace; he thus acquired the post-nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.

==Death==
Spicer died at the Cromwell Hospital in Kensington, London, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and leukaemia on 29 May 2019.

<doc id="414942" wikidata="Q36734" url="?curid=414942" title="Phoenician language">
<text>Phoenician ( ; ) is an extinct Canaanite Semitic language originally spoken in the region surrounding the cities of Tyre and Sidon. Extensive Tyro-Sidonian trade and commercial dominance led to Phoenician becoming a lingua franca of the maritime Mediterranean during the Iron Age. The Phoenician alphabet spread to Greece during this period, where it became the source of all modern European scripts.

Phoenician belongs to the Canaanite languages and as such is quite similar to Biblical Hebrew and other languages of the group, at least in its early stages, and is therefore mutually intelligible with them.

The area in which Phoenician was spoken, which the Phoenicians called &quot;Pūt&quot;, includes the northern Levant, specifically the areas now including Syria, Lebanon, the Western Galilee, parts of Cyprus, some adjacent areas of Anatolia, and, at least as a prestige language, the rest of Anatolia. Phoenician was also spoken in the Phoenician colonies along the coasts of the southwestern Mediterranean Sea, including those of modern Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and Algeria as well as Malta, the west of Sicily, southwest Sardinia, the Balearic Islands and southernmost Spain.

In modern times, the language was first decoded by Jean-Jacques Barthélemy in 1758, who noted that the name &quot;Phoenician&quot; was first given to the language by Samuel Bochart in his &quot;Geographia Sacra seu Phaleg et Canaan&quot;.

==History==
The Phoenicians were the first state-level society to make extensive use of the Semitic alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet is one of the oldest verified consonantal alphabet, or &quot;abjad.&quot; It has become conventional to refer to the script as &quot;Proto-Canaanite&quot; until the mid-11th century BC, when it is first attested on inscribed bronze arrowheads, and as &quot;Phoenician&quot; only after 1050 BC. The Phoenician phonetic alphabet is generally believed to be at least the partial ancestor of almost all modern alphabets.
From a traditional linguistic perspective, Phoenician was composed of a variety of dialects. According to some sources, Phoenician developed into distinct Tyro-Sidonian and Byblian dialects. By this account, the Tyro-Sidonian dialect, from which the Punic language eventually emerged, spread across the Mediterranean through trade and colonisation, whereas the ancient dialect of Byblos, known from a corpus of only a few dozen extant inscriptions, played no expansionary role. However, the very slight differences in language and the insufficient records of the time make it unclear whether Phoenician formed a separate and united dialect or was merely a superficially defined part of a broader language continuum. Through their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to the Maghreb and Europe, where it was adopted by the Greeks. Later, the Etruscans adopted a modified version for their own use, which, in turn, was modified and adopted by the Romans and became the Latin alphabet. In the east of the Mediterranean region, the language was in use as late as the 1st century BC, when it seems to have gone extinct there.

Punic colonisation spread Phoenician to the western Mediterranean, where the distinct Punic language developed. Punic also died out, but it seems to have survived far longer than Phoenician, until the sixth century, perhaps even into the ninth century.

==Writing system==
Phoenician was written with the Phoenician script, an abjad (consonantary) originating from the Proto-Canaanite alphabet that also became the basis for the Greek alphabet and, via an Etruscan adaptation, the Latin alphabet. The Punic form of the script gradually developed somewhat different and more cursive letter shapes; in the 3rd century BC, it also began to exhibit a tendency to mark the presence of vowels, especially final vowels, with an aleph or sometimes an ayin. Furthermore, around the time of the Second Punic War, an even more cursive form began to develop, which gave rise to a variety referred to as Neo-Punic and existed alongside the more conservative form and became predominant some time after the destruction of Carthage (c. 149 BC). Neo-Punic, in turn, tended to designate vowels with matres lectionis (&quot;consonantal letters&quot;) more frequently than the previous systems had and also began to systematically use different letters for different vowels, in the way explained in more detail below. Finally, a number of late inscriptions from what is now Constantine, Algeria dated to the first century BC make use of the Greek alphabet to write Punic, and many inscriptions from Tripolitania, in the third and fourth centuries AD use the Latin alphabet for that purpose.

In Phoenician writing, unlike that of abjads such as those of Aramaic, Biblical Hebrew and Arabic, even long vowels remained generally unexpressed, regardless of their origin (even if they originated from diphthongs, as in bt &#x27;house&#x27;, for earlier &quot;*bayt-&quot;; Hebrew spelling has byt). Eventually, Punic writers began to implement systems of marking of vowels by means of &quot;matres lectionis&quot;. In the 3rd century BC appeared the practice of using final &#x27;ālep to mark the presence of any final vowel and, occasionally, of yōd to mark a final long .

Later, mostly after the destruction of Carthage in the so-called &quot;Neo-Punic&quot; inscriptions, that was supplemented by a system in which wāw denoted , yōd denoted , &#x27;ālep denoted and , ʿayin denoted and hē and  could also be used to signify . This latter system was used first with foreign words and was then extended to many native words as well.

A third practice reported in the literature is the use of the consonantal letters for vowels in the same way as had occurred in the original adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet to Greek and Latin, which was apparently still transparent to Punic writers: hē for and &#x27;ālep for .

Later, Punic inscriptions began to be written in the Latin alphabet, which also indicated the vowels. Those later inscriptions, in addition with some inscriptions in Greek letters and transcriptions of Phoenician names into other languages, represent the main source of knowledge about Phoenician vowels.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The following table presents the consonant phonemes of the Phoenician language as represented in the Phoenician alphabet, alongside their standard Semiticist transliteration and reconstructed phonetic values in the International Phonetic Alphabet:

The system reflected in the abjad above is the product of several mergers. From Proto-Northwest Semitic to Canaanite, and have merged into , and have merged into , and , and have merged into . Next, from Canaanite to Phoenician, the sibilants and were merged as , and were merged as , and * and * were merged as *. For the phonetic values of the sibilants, see below. These latter developments also occurred in Biblical Hebrew at one point or another, except that merged into there.

==== Sibilants ====
The original value of the Proto-Semitic sibilants, and accordingly of their Phoenician counterparts, is disputed. While the traditional sound values are for , for , for , and for , recent scholarship argues that was , was , was , and was , as transcribed in the consonant table above. Krahmalkov, too, suggests that Phoenician *z may have been [dz] or even [zd] based on Latin transcriptions such as &quot;esde&quot; for the demonstrative &quot;z.&quot;

On the other hand, it is debated whether šīn and sāmek , which are mostly well distinguished by the Phoenician orthography, also eventually merged at some point, either in Classical Phoenician or in Late Punic.

==== Postvelars ====
In later Punic, the laryngeals and pharyngeals seem to have been entirely lost. Neither these nor the emphatics could be adequately represented by the Latin alphabet, but there is also evidence to that effect from Punic script transcriptions.

==== Lenition ====
There is no consensus on whether Phoenician-Punic ever underwent the lenition of stop consonants that happened in most other Northwest Semitic languages such as Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (cf. Hackett vs Segert and Lyavdansky). The consonant may have been &quot;generally&quot; transformed into in Punic and in late Phoenician, as it was in Proto-Arabic. Certainly, Latin-script renditions of late Punic include many spirantised transcriptions with &quot;ph&quot;, &quot;th&quot; and &quot;kh&quot; in various positions (although the interpretation of these spellings is not entirely clear) as well as the letter &quot;f&quot; for the original *p. However, in Neo-Punic, *b lenited to /v/ contiguous to a following consonant, as in the Latin transcription &quot;lifnim&quot; for *lbnm &quot;for his son&quot;.

===Vowels===
Knowledge of the vowel system is very imperfect because of the characteristics of the writing system. During most of its existence, Phoenician writing showed no vowels at all, and even as vowel notation systems did eventually arise late in its history, they never came to be applied consistently to native vocabulary. It is thought that Phoenician had the short vowels , , and the long vowels , , , , . The Proto-Semitic diphthongs and are realised as and . That must have happened earlier than in Biblical Hebrew since the resultant long vowels are not marked with the semivowel letters (&quot;bēt&quot; &quot;house&quot; was written bt, in contrast to Biblical Hebrew byt).

The most conspicuous vocalic development in Phoenician is the so-called Canaanite shift, shared by Biblical Hebrew, but going further in Phoenician. The Proto-Northwest Semitic and became not merely as in Tiberian Hebrew, but . Stressed Proto-Semitic became Tiberian Hebrew ( in other traditions), but Phoenician . The shift is proved by Latin and Greek transcriptions like &quot;rūs/ρους&quot; for &quot;head, cape&quot; 𐤓𐤀𐤔 /ruːʃ/ (Tiberian Hebrew &quot;rōš&quot; /roːʃ/, ); similarly notice stressed (corresponding to Tiberian Hebrew ) &quot;samō/σαμω&quot; for &quot;he heard&quot; 𐤔𐤌𐤏 /ʃaˈmoʕ/ (Tiberian Hebrew &quot;šāmaʻ&quot; /ʃɔːˈmaʕ/, ); similarly the word for &quot;eternity&quot; is known from Greek transcriptions to have been &quot;ūlōm/ουλομ&quot; 𐤏𐤋𐤌 /ʕuːˈloːm/, corresponding to Biblical Hebrew &quot;ʻōlām&quot; עולם /ʕoːlɔːm/ and Proto-Semitic &quot;ʻālam&quot; /ˈʕaːlam/ (in Arabic: &quot;ʻālam&quot; عالم /ˈʕaːlam/). The letter Y used for words such as 𐤀𐤔 /ʔəʃ/ &quot;ys/υς&quot; &quot;which&quot; and 𐤀𐤕 /ʔət/ &quot;yth/υθ&quot; (definite accusative marker) in Greek and Latin alphabet inscriptions can be interpreted as denoting a reduced schwa vowel that occurred in pre-stress syllables in verbs and two syllables before stress in nouns and adjectives, while other instances of Y as in &quot;chyl/χυλ&quot; and even &quot;chil/χιλ&quot; for 𐤊𐤋 /kull/ &quot;all&quot; in &quot;Poenulus&quot; can be interpreted as a further stage in the vowel shift resulting in fronting () and even subsequent delabialisation of and . Short in originally-open syllables was lowered to and was also lengthened if it was accented.

===Suprasegmentals===

Stress-dependent vowel changes indicate that stress was probably mostly final, as in Biblical Hebrew. Long vowels probably occurred only in open syllables.

==Grammar==
As is typical for the Semitic languages, Phoenician words are usually built around consonantal roots and vowel changes are used extensively to express morphological distinctions. However, unlike most Semitic languages, Phoenician preserved (or, possibly, re-introduced) numerous uniconsonantal and biconsonantal roots seen in Proto-Afro-Asiatic: compare the verbs 𐤊𐤍 kn &quot;to be&quot; vs Arabic كون kwn, 𐤌𐤕 mt &quot;to die&quot; vs Hebrew and Arabic מות/موت mwt and 𐤎𐤓 sr &quot;to remove&quot; vs Hebrew סרר srr.

===Nominal morphology===
Nouns are marked for gender (masculine and feminine), number (singular, plural and vestiges of the dual) and state (absolute and construct, the latter being nouns that are followed by their possessors) and also have the category definiteness. There is some evidence for remains of the Proto-Semitic genitive grammatical case as well. While many of the endings coalesce in the standard orthography, inscriptions in the Latin and Greek alphabet permit the reconstruction of the noun endings, which are also the adjective endings, as follows:

In late Punic, the final of the feminine was apparently dropped: &#x27; &quot;son of the queen&quot; or &#x27; &quot;brother of the queen&quot; rendered in Latin as HIMILCO. was also assimilated to following consonants: e.g. 𐤔𐤕 &quot;year&quot; for earlier 𐤔𐤍𐤕 .

The case endings in general must have been lost between the 9th century BC and the 7th century BC: the personal name rendered in Akkadian as ma-ti-nu-ba-a-li &quot;Gift of Baal&quot;, with the case endings -u and -i, was written ma-ta-an-baa-al (likely Phoenician spelling *𐤌𐤕𐤍𐤁𐤏𐤋) two centuries later. However, evidence has been found for a retention of the genitive case in the form of the first-singular possessive suffix: 𐤀𐤁𐤉 &#x27; /abiya/ &quot;of my father&quot; vs 𐤀𐤁 &#x27; /abī/ &quot;my father&quot;. If true, this may suggest that cases were still distinguished to some degree in other forms as well.

The written forms and the reconstructed pronunciations of the personal pronouns are as follows:

Singular: &lt;br&gt;
1st: // 𐤀𐤍𐤊 &#x27; (Punic sometimes 𐤀𐤍𐤊𐤉 &#x27;), also attested as //&lt;br&gt;
2nd masc. // 𐤀𐤕 &lt;br&gt;
2nd fem. // 𐤀𐤕 &lt;br&gt;
3rd masc. // 𐤄𐤀 &#x27;, also [] (?) 𐤄𐤉 &#x27; and // 𐤄𐤀𐤕 &lt;br&gt;
3rd fem. // 𐤄𐤀 

Plural: &lt;br&gt;
1st: // 𐤀𐤍𐤇𐤍 &lt;br&gt;
2nd masc. // 𐤀𐤕𐤌 &lt;br&gt;
2nd fem. unattested, perhaps // 𐤀𐤕𐤍 &lt;br&gt;
3rd masc. and feminine // 𐤄𐤌𐤕 

Enclitic personal pronouns were added to nouns (to encode possession) and to prepositions, as shown below for &quot;Standard Phoenician&quot; (the predominant dialect, as distinct from the Byblian and the late Punic varieties). They appear in a slightly different form depending on whether or not they follow plural-form masculine nouns (and so are added after a vowel). The former is given in brackets with the abbreviation a.V.

Singular: &lt;br&gt;
1st: // &#x27;, also 𐤉 &#x27; (a.V. // ) &lt;br&gt;
2nd masc. // 𐤊 &lt;br&gt;
2nd fem. // 𐤊 &lt;br&gt;
3rd masc. // &#x27;, Punic 𐤀 , (a.V. // &#x27;) &lt;br&gt;
3rd fem. // &#x27;, Punic 𐤀 (a.V. // &#x27;)

Plural: &lt;br&gt;
1st: // 𐤍 &lt;br&gt;
2nd masc. // 𐤊𐤌 &lt;br&gt;
2nd fem. unattested, perhaps // 𐤊𐤍 &lt;br&gt;
3rd masc. // 𐤌 &#x27; (a.V. // 𐤍𐤌 &#x27;) &lt;br&gt;
3rd fem. // 𐤌 &#x27; (a.V. // 𐤍𐤌 &#x27;)

In addition, according to some research, the same written forms of the enclitics that are attested after vowels are also found after a singular noun in what must have been the genitive case (which ended in , whereas the plural version ended in ). Their pronunciation can then be reconstructed somewhat differently: first-person singular // 𐤉 &#x27;, third-person singular masculine and feminine // 𐤉 &#x27; and // 𐤉 &#x27;. The third-person plural singular and feminine must have pronounced the same in both cases, i.e. // 𐤍𐤌 &#x27; and // 𐤍𐤌 .

These enclitic forms vary between the dialects. In the archaic Byblian dialect, the third person forms are 𐤄 h and 𐤅 w // for the masculine singular (a.V. 𐤅 w //), 𐤄 h // for the feminine singular and 𐤅𐤌 hm // for the masculine plural. In late Punic, the 3rd masculine singular is usually // 𐤌 .

The same enclitic pronouns are also attached to verbs to denote direct objects. In that function, some of them have slightly divergent forms: first singular // 𐤍 and probably first plural //.

The near demonstrative pronouns (&quot;this&quot;) are written, in standard Phoenician, 𐤆 z [za] for the singular and 𐤀𐤋 &#x27; [ʔilːa] for the plural. Cypriot Phoenician displays 𐤀𐤆 &#x27; [ʔizːa] instead of 𐤆 z [za]. Byblian still distinguishes, in the singular, a masculine &#x27; [zan] / &#x27; [za] from a feminine 𐤆𐤕 &#x27; [zuːt] / 𐤆𐤀 &#x27; [zuː]. There are also many variations in Punic, including 𐤎𐤕 st [suːt] and 𐤆𐤕 zt [zuːt] for both genders in the singular. The far demonstrative pronouns (&quot;that&quot;) are identical to the independent third-person pronouns. The interrogative pronouns are or perhaps 𐤌𐤉 &#x27; &quot;who&quot; and 𐤌 &#x27; &quot;what&quot;. Indefinite pronouns are &quot;anything&quot; is written 𐤌𐤍𐤌 mnm (possibly pronounced [miːnumːa], similar to Akkadian [miːnumːeː]) and 𐤌𐤍𐤊 mnk (possibly pronounced [miːnukːa]). The relative pronoun is a 𐤔 [ʃi], either followed or preceded by a vowel.

The definite article was , and the first consonant of the following word was doubled. It was written 𐤄 h but in late Punic also 𐤀 &#x27; and 𐤏 &#x27; because of the weakening and coalescence of the gutturals. Much as in Biblical Hebrew, the initial consonant of the article is dropped after the prepositions 𐤁 b-, 𐤋 l- and 𐤊 k-; it could also be lost after various other particles and function words, such the direct object marker 𐤀𐤉𐤕 and the conjunction 𐤅 w- &quot;and&quot;.

Of the cardinal numerals from 1 to 10, 1 is an adjective, 2 is formally a noun in the dual and the rest are nouns in the singular. They all distinguish gender: 𐤀𐤇𐤃 &#x27;, 𐤀𐤔𐤍𐤌/𐤔𐤍𐤌 &#x27; (construct state 𐤀𐤔𐤍/𐤔𐤍 &#x27;), 𐤔𐤋𐤔 &#x27;, 𐤀𐤓𐤁𐤏 &#x27;, 𐤇𐤌𐤔 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤔 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤁𐤏 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤌𐤍/𐤔𐤌𐤍𐤄 &#x27;, 𐤕𐤔𐤏 &#x27;, 𐤏𐤔𐤓/𐤏𐤎𐤓 &#x27; vs 𐤀𐤇𐤕 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤕𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤋𐤔𐤕 &#x27;, 𐤀𐤓𐤁𐤏𐤕 &#x27;, 𐤇𐤌𐤔𐤕 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤔𐤕 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤁𐤏𐤕 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤌𐤍𐤕 &#x27;, unattested, 𐤏𐤔𐤓𐤕 &#x27;. The tens are morphologically masculine plurals of the ones: 𐤏𐤔𐤓𐤌/𐤏𐤎𐤓𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤋𐤔𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤀𐤓𐤁𐤏𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤇𐤌𐤔𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤔𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤁𐤏𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤔𐤌𐤍𐤌 &#x27;, 𐤕𐤔𐤏𐤌 &#x27;. &quot;One hundred&quot; is 𐤌𐤀𐤕 &#x27;, two hundred is its dual form 𐤌𐤀𐤕𐤌 &#x27;, whereas the rest are formed as in 𐤔𐤋𐤔 𐤌𐤀𐤕 &#x27; (three hundred). One thousand is 𐤀𐤋𐤐 &#x27;. Ordinal numerals are formed by the addition of *ij 𐤉 &#x27;. Composite numerals are formed with w- 𐤅 &quot;and&quot;, e.g. 𐤏𐤔𐤓 𐤅𐤔𐤍𐤌 &#x27; for &quot;twelve&quot;.

===Verbal morphology===
The verb inflects for person, number, gender, tense and mood. Like for other Semitic languages, Phoenician verbs have different &quot;verbal patterns&quot; or &quot;stems&quot;, expressing manner of action, level of transitivity and voice.
The perfect or suffix-conjugation, which expresses the past tense, is exemplified below with the root 𐤐𐤏𐤋 p-ʻ-l &quot;to do&quot; (a &quot;neutral&quot;, G-stem).

Singular: 
*1st: // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕𐤉 
*2nd masc. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 
*2nd fem. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 
*3rd masc. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋 
*3rd fem. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 &#x27;, also 𐤐𐤏𐤋 &#x27;, Punic 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤀 

Plural: 
*1st: // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤍 
*2nd masc. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕𐤌 
*2nd fem. unattested, perhaps // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕𐤍 
*3rd masc. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋 &#x27;, Punic 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤀 &#x27;
*3rd fem. // 𐤐𐤏𐤋 &#x27;, Punic 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤀 &#x27;

The imperfect or prefix-conjugation, which expresses the present and future tense (and which is not distinguishable from the descendant of the Proto-Semitic jussive expressing wishes), is exemplified below, again with the root p-ʻ-l.

*1st: // 𐤀𐤐𐤏𐤋 
*2nd masc. // 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋 
*2nd fem. // 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤉 
*3rd masc. // 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 
*3rd fem. // 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋 
Plural:
*1st: // 𐤍𐤐𐤏𐤋 
*2nd masc. // 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋 &#x27;, Punic 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤀 &#x27;
*2nd fem. // 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤍 
*3rd masc. // 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 
*3rd fem. *// 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤍 

The imperative endings were presumably , and for the second-person singular masculine, second-person singular feminine and second-person plural masculine respectively, but all three forms surface in the orthography as // 𐤐𐤏𐤋 &#x27;: &#x27;. The old Semitic jussive, which originally differed slightly from the prefix conjugation, is no longer possible to separate from it in Phoenician with the present data.

The non-finite forms are the infinitive construct, the infinitive absolute and the active and passive participles. In the G-stem, the infinitive construct is usually combined with the preposition 𐤋 l- &quot;to&quot;, as in 𐤋𐤐𐤏𐤋 &quot;to do&quot;; in contrast, the infinitive absolute 𐤐𐤏𐤋 (paʻōl) is mostly used to strengthen the meaning of a subsequent finite verb with the same root: 𐤐𐤕𐤇 𐤕𐤐𐤕𐤇 &quot;you will indeed open!&quot;, accordingly /𐤐𐤏𐤋 𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋 / &quot;you will indeed do!&quot;.

The participles had, in the G-stem, the following forms: 

Active: 
*Masculine singular &quot;//&quot; later &quot;//&quot; 𐤐𐤏𐤋 , plural &quot;//&quot; or &quot;//&quot; 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤌 
*Feminine singular 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 , plural 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 

Passive: 
*Masculine singular // or // 𐤐𐤏𐤋 , plural // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤌 
*Feminine singular // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 , plural // 𐤐𐤏𐤋𐤕 

The missing forms above can be inferred from the correspondences between the Proto-Northwest Semitic ancestral forms and the attested Phoenician counterparts: the PNWS participle forms are *.

The derived stems are:
* the N-stem (functioning as a passive), e.g. // 𐤍𐤐𐤏𐤋 npʻl, the N-formant being lost in the prefix conjugation while assimilating and doubling the first root consonant 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 (ypʻl).
* the D-stem (functioning as a factitive): the forms must have been 𐤐𐤏𐤋 /piʻʻil/ in the suffix conjugation, 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 /yapaʻʻil/ in the prefix conjugation, 𐤐𐤏𐤋 /paʻʻil/ in the imperative and the infinitive construct, 𐤐𐤏𐤋 /paʻʻōl/ in the infinitive absolute and 𐤌𐤐𐤏𐤋 /mapaʻʻil/ in the participle. The characteristic doubling of the middle consonant is only identifiable in foreign alphabet transcriptions.
* the C-stem (functioning as a causative): the original 𐤄 *ha- prefix has produced 𐤉 *yi- rather than the Hebrew ה *hi-. The forms were apparently 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 /yipʻil/ in the suffix conjugation 𐤀𐤐𐤏𐤋(/ in late Punic), 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 /yapʻil/ in the prefix conjugation, and the infinitive is also 𐤉𐤐𐤏𐤋 /yapʻil/, while the participle was probably 𐤌𐤐𐤏𐤋 /mapʻil/ or, in late Punic at least, 𐤌𐤐𐤏𐤋 /mipʻil/.

Most of the stems apparently also had passive and reflexive counterparts, the former differing through vowels, the latter also through the infix 𐤕 -t-. The G stem passive is attested as 𐤐𐤉𐤏𐤋 pyʻl, &lt; *; t-stems can be reconstructed as 𐤉𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋 ytpʻl /yitpaʻil/ (tG) and 𐤉𐤕𐤐𐤏𐤋 yptʻʻl /yiptaʻʻil/ (Dt).

===Prepositions and particles===
Some prepositions are always prefixed to nouns, deleting, if present, the initial of the definite article: such are 𐤁 b- &quot;in&quot;, 𐤋 l- &quot;to, for&quot;, 𐤊 k- &quot;as&quot; and 𐤌 m- // &quot;from&quot;. They are sometimes found in forms extended through the addition of 𐤍 -n or 𐤕 -t. Other prepositions are not like that: 𐤀𐤋 &quot;upon&quot;, .𐤏𐤃 &quot;until&quot;, 𐤀𐤇𐤓 &quot;after&quot;, 𐤕𐤇𐤕 &quot;under&quot;, 𐤁𐤉𐤍, 𐤁𐤍 &quot;between&quot;. New prepositions are formed with nouns: 𐤋𐤐𐤍 lpn &quot;in front of&quot;, from 𐤋 l- &quot;to&quot; and 𐤐𐤍 pn &quot;face&quot;. There is a special preposited marker of a definite object 𐤀𐤉𐤕 (//?), which, unlike Hebrew, is clearly distinct from the preposition את (//).

The most common negative marker is 𐤁𐤋 (//), negating verbs but sometimes also nouns; another one is 𐤀𐤉 (//), expressing both nonexistence and the negation of verbs. Negative commands or prohibitions are expressed with 𐤀𐤋 (//). &quot;Lest&quot; is 𐤋𐤌 . Some common conjunctions are 𐤅 (originally perhaps //, but certainly // in Late Punic), &quot;and&quot; 𐤀𐤌 (), &quot;when&quot;, and 𐤊 (), &quot;that; because; when&quot;. There was also a conjunction 𐤀𐤐/𐤐 (&quot;also&quot;. 𐤋 (//) could (rarely) be used to introduce desiderative constructions (&quot;may he do X!&quot;). 𐤋 could also introduce vocatives. Both prepositions and conjunctions could form compounds.

==Syntax==
The basic word order is verb-subject-object. There is no verb &quot;to be&quot; in the present tense; in clauses that would have used a copula, the subject may come before the predicate. Nouns precede their modifiers, such as adjectives and possessors.

==Vocabulary and word formation==
Most nouns are formed by a combination of consonantal roots and vocalic patterns, but they can be formed also with prefixes (𐤌 , expressing actions or their results, and rarely 𐤕 ) and suffixes . Abstracts can be formed with the suffix 𐤕 -t (probably , ). Adjectives can be formed following the familiar Semitic nisba suffix 𐤉 y 𐤑𐤃𐤍𐤉 (e.g. ṣdny &quot;Sidonian&quot;).

Like the grammar, the vocabulary is very close to Biblical Hebrew, but some peculiarities attract attention. For example, the copula verb &quot;to be&quot; is 𐤊𐤍 kn (as in Arabic, as opposed to Hebrew and Aramaic היה hyh) and the verb &quot;to do&quot; is 𐤐𐤏𐤋 pʿl (as in Aramaic פעל pʿl and Arabic فعل fʿl, as opposed to Hebrew עשה ʿśh, though in Hebrew פעל pʿl has the similar meaning &quot;to act&quot;).

==Survival and influences of Punic==

The significantly divergent later form of the language that was spoken in the Tyrian Phoenician colony of Carthage is known as Punic and remained in use there for considerably longer than Phoenician did in Phoenicia itself by arguably surviving into Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s time. Throughout its existence, Punic co-existed with the Berber languages, which were then native to Tunisia (including Carthage) and North Africa. It is possible that Punic may have survived the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in some small isolated area: the geographer al-Bakri describes a people speaking a language that was not Berber, Latin or Coptic in the city of Sirte in rural Ifriqiya, a region in which spoken Punic survived well past its written use. However, it is likely that arabisation of the Punics was facilitated by their language belonging to the same group (both being Semitic languages) as that of the conquerors and thus having many grammatical and lexical similarities.

The ancient Libyco-Berber alphabet that is still in irregular use by modern Berber groups such as the Tuareg is known by the native name Tifinagh, possibly a derived form of a cognate of the name &quot;Punic&quot;. Still, a direct derivation from the Phoenician-Punic script is debated and far from established since the two writing systems are very different. As far as language (not the script) is concerned, some borrowings from Punic appear in modern Berber dialects: one interesting example is &quot;agadir&quot; &quot;wall&quot; from Punic &quot;gader&quot;.

Perhaps the most interesting case of Punic influence is that of the name of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising Portugal and Spain), which, according to one of the theories, is derived from the Punic &quot;I-Shaphan&quot; meaning &quot;coast of hyraxes&quot;, in turn a misidentification on the part of Phoenician explorers of its numerous rabbits as hyraxes. Another case is the name of a tribe of hostile &quot;hairy people&quot; that Hanno the Navigator found in the Gulf of Guinea. The name given to those people by Hanno the Navigator&#x27;s interpreters was transmitted from Punic into Greek as &quot;gorillai&quot; and was applied in 1847 by Thomas S. Savage to the western gorilla.

==Surviving examples==
Phoenician, together with Punic, is primarily known from approximately 10,000 surviving inscriptions, supplemented by occasional glosses in books written in other languages. In addition to their many inscriptions, the Phoenicians are believed to have left numerous other types of written sources, but most have not survived.

Roman authors, such as Sallust, allude to some books written in the Punic language, but none have survived except occasionally in translation (e.g., Mago&#x27;s treatise) or in snippets (e.g., in Plautus&#x27; plays). The Cippi of Melqart, a bilingual inscription in Ancient Greek and Carthaginian discovered in Malta in 1694, was the key which allowed French scholar Jean-Jacques Barthélemy to decipher and reconstruct the alphabet in 1758. Even as late as 1837 only 70 Phoenician inscriptions were known to scholars. These were compiled in Wilhelm Gesenius&#x27;s &quot;Scripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae monumenta&quot;, which comprised all that was known of Phoenician by scholars at that time.
Some key surviving inscriptions of Phoenician are:

*Ahiram sarcophagus
*Bodashtart inscriptions
*Çineköy inscription
*Cippi of Melqart
*Mdina Steles
*Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II
*Karatepe bilingual
*Kilamuwa Stela
*Nora Stone
*Pyrgi Tablets
*Temple of Eshmun

Since the bilingual Pyrgi Tablets were found in 1964 with inscriptions in both Etruscan and Phoenician dating from around 500 BC, more Etruscan has been deciphered through comparison to the more fully understood Phoenician.

<doc id="414947" wikidata="Q1362053" url="?curid=414947" title="Battle of Mantinea (418 BC)">
<text>The first Battle of Mantinea was fought in 418 BC during the Peloponnesian War. In this battle, Sparta and its Peloponnesian allies defeated an allied army of Argos, Athens, Mantinea and several others.

==Background==
In 421 BC, after ten years of war, Athens and Sparta made peace; the Peace of Nicias. Several years later an alliance of democraties arose in the Peloponnese, threatening Sparta&#x27;s hegemony over the peninsula. After the alliance between the Argives, Achaeans, Eleans, and Athens, the Spartans were defeated in the Olympic Games of 420 BC After the invasion of Epidaurus by Athens and its allies, Sparta chose to retaliate, fearing their potential alliance with Corinth. The army that was amassed was, according to Thucydides, &quot;the best army ever assembled in Greece to that time&quot;. The Spartan king Agis concluded the first campaign with a truce, without explaining his actions to the army or his allies. Soon after the Argives denounced the truce and resumed the war, capturing the key town of Orchomenus. As a result, Spartans directed their anger towards Agis, who avoided a 10,000 drachmas fine and the destruction of his house, by promising to redeem himself with a victory. The ephors placed Agis under the supervision of ten &quot;symbouloi&quot; (advisers), whose consent was required for whatever military action he wished to take.

==Prelude==
Late in 418, the Argives and their allies marched against Tegea, where a faction was prepared to turn the city over to the Argive alliance. Tegea controlled the exit from Laconia. Enemy control of the town would mean that the Spartans would be unable to move out of their home city and would result in the demise of the Peloponnesian coalition that fought the Archidamian War.

Agis marched the whole of the Spartan army, including neodamodes and everyone who was able to fight in Sparta into Tegea where he was joined by his allies from Arcadia. Agis sent for help from his northern allies, Corinth, Boeotia, Phocis, and Locris. However, the northern army could not arrive at the scene in time, as they had not expected the call and would have to pass through enemy territory (Argos and Orchomenus). On the whole, the army of the allies of Sparta would have numbered around 9,000 hoplites.

In the meantime, the Eleans wanted to attack Lepreum, a contested border town with Sparta. They chose to withdraw their contingent of 3,000 hoplites and march for Lepreum. Agis took advantage of the withdrawal and sent a sixth of his army, with the youngest and the oldest hoplites home to guard Sparta proper. They were called back soon after, as Agis or the symbouloi realized that the Eleans would soon be back on the side of the Argives, but did not arrive in time for the battle.

Agis could have bided his time inside the walls of Tegea, waiting for his northern allies. However, he was already discredited and could not show the slightest sign of shying away from the battle. So he invaded the territory around Mantinea, about 15 km north of Tegea and a member of the Argive alliance, to force a pitched battle with the Argives and their allies. The Argive army, however, was situated on the ground &quot;steep and hard to get at&quot; and would not be drawn into battle, probably because the grain harvest had already been stored (the battle probably took place at the end of September 418). Agis, who was desperate for a victory to redeem his embarrassment at Argos, charged ahead; but according to Thucydides, when the armies had closed to a stone&#x27;s throw, &quot;one of the elder Spartans&quot; (the symboulos Pharax, according to Diodorus) advised him not to try to correct one error (his former defeat) with another. The Spartans therefore retreated and went off to find a way to draw out the Argive army to a battle. So they diverted the Sarandapotamos River to the bed of the smaller Zanovistas river, or, they just filled up the sinkholes in which Zanovistas flowed, in order to flood the Mantinean territory.

Instead of allowing Mantinea to be flooded, the Argive army moved quicker than the Spartans anticipated, as the Argive hoplites were angry at their generals for not pursuing the Spartan army and accused them of treason. They surprised their enemies by drawing up as the Spartans emerged from a nearby wood. The Spartans quickly organized themselves, with no time to wait for their other allies. Brasidas&#x27; veterans (Brasidas himself had been killed at the Battle of Amphipolis), and the Sciritae formed the left wing, the Spartans, Arcadians, Heraeans, and Maenalians in the centre, and the Tegeans, who were fighting for their homeland took the position of honour on the right wing. The Argive lines were formed by the Mantineans on the right, the Argives in the centre, and the Athenians on the left.

==Opposing forces==
Thucydides, the main contemporary source on the battle, did not know the exact numbers of men on each side but estimated that there were about 9,000 men on the Spartan side with somewhat fewer men on the Argive coalition&#x27;s side, about 8,000 according to Donald Kagan. Other scholars, such as Victor Davis Hanson, give slightly bigger numbers.

The Spartan army of around 9,000 men must have included about 3,600 Spartans (Thucydides mentions six Spartan morea), around 2,000 Brasidian veterans and recently recruited Neodamodes, 600 Sciritae, and 3,000 Arcadians (including 1,500 Tegeans).

The Argive coalition&#x27;s army had 4,000–5,000 Argives, 2,000–3,000 Arcadians (Mantineans, Cleoneans, Orneaens) and 1,000 Athenian hoplites and 300 Athenian horsemen.

==Battle==
As the battle began, each side&#x27;s right wing began to outflank the other&#x27;s left, due to the erratic movements of each hoplite trying to cover himself with the shield of the man beside him. Agis tried to strengthen the line by ordering the Sciritae and his left to break off contact with the rest of the army and match the length of the Argive line. To cover the void created, he ordered the companies of Hipponoidas and Aristocles to leave their positions in the center and cover the line. This however was not achieved, for the two captains were unable, or unwilling to complete these maneuvers on such short notice. Donald Kagan considers it an ill-advised move and gives credit to the two captains for disobeying orders that could have lost the battle for the Spartans. Others considered that the original move could have succeeded.

In any case, the Mantineans and the right part of the Argives, the elite Argive Thousand, entered the gap and routed the Brasideans and the Sciritae, and pursued them for a long distance. In the meantime, the Tegeans and the regular Spartan army routed the Argives and Arcadians in the center. Most of them did not stand to fight, but they fled as the Spartans approached; some were trampled in their hurry to get away before the enemy reached them. While the Argive-Arcadian center was being chased off the field, the Athenians who formed the left were beginning to get encircled. Their cavalry prevented a rout, allowing the Athenian infantry to retreat in good order. Agis did not pursue the Athenians but turned the center and right around and marched to give support to his hard-pressed left. The Mantineans were chased off the field with heavy losses while the Spartans allowed the Argive Thousand to escape virtually unharmed.

The Spartans did not pursue the enemy for long after the battle was won.

==Aftermath==
The Argive side lost about 1,100 men (700 Argives and Arcadians, 200 Athenians and 200 Mantineans), and the Spartans about 300.

The Spartans sent an embassy to Argos and the Argives accepted a truce by the terms of which they gave up Orchomenus, and all their hostages and joined up with the Spartans in evicting the Athenians from Epidaurus. They also renounced their alliance with Elis and Athens. After deposing the democratic government of Sicyon, the Argive Thousand staged a coup against the democratic rule of Argos. The democrats&#x27; morale was low because of the bad performance of the common army and the Athenians in the battle. 

In more general terms, the battle was a considerable boost to the Lacedaemonians&#x27; morale and prestige, because after the disaster at Pylos they had been considered cowardly and incompetent in battle. Their success at Mantinea marked a reversal of the trend.

<doc id="414949" wikidata="Q536307" url="?curid=414949" title="Anne of Burgundy">
<text>Anne of Burgundy, Duchess of Bedford () (30 September 1404 – 13 November 1432) was a daughter of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (1371–1419), and his wife Margaret of Bavaria (1363–1423).

==Duchess of Bedford==
In June 1423 at Troyes, Anne married John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, son of Henry IV of England, a marriage agreed by the terms of the 1423 Treaty of Amiens. The marriage was meant to cement relations between England and Anne&#x27;s brother Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. This alliance was vital for continued English success in France as, in 1422, John had been appointed Regent of France, during the minority of his nephew, Henry VI of England, who was seven months old at the death of his father on 31 August 1422. Burgundy&#x27;s antagonism towards the House of Valois (which caused the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War) had been one of the leading factors in the losses faced by the French at the hands of the English. While John and Anne were happily married, their union remained childless. 

Anne was present during the trial against Joan of Arc. She herself, or the women of her household on her behalf, examined the virginity of Joan of Arc and confirmed her to be a virgin. Anne was reportedly impressed by Joan of Arc, and gave orders that no man, guards or men or high rank, was to touch Joan during her imprisonment. Anne attended the execution of Joan of Arc in Rouen in 1431.

==Death and legacy==
Anne died on 13 November 1432 in Paris, at the &quot;Hôtel de Bourbon&quot;, adjoining the Louvre Palace. She was buried at the &quot;couvent des Célestins&quot;, while her heart was deposited at the &quot;couvent des Grands-Augustins&quot;. Her tomb was designed by Guillaume Vluten and, according to one historian, &quot;ranks among the most important Parisian effigies of the first half of the fifteenth century&quot;. Of the original funerary monument at the &quot;couvent des Célestins&quot; (which was destroyed in 1849), two pieces have survived: the &quot;gisant&quot; (recumbent statue), which is at the Louvre museum, and the &quot;pleurants&quot; (mourning statue), at the Musée de Cluny, the Middle Ages museum in Paris. Bones and other remains, found during archeological exploration of the &quot;couvent des Célestins&quot; in 1847, were identified as being those of Anne, thanks to a plaque bearing her name. In 1853, these remains were re-buried in the grave of her grandfather, Philip the Bold, in Saint Bégnine cathedral in Dijon.

Anne&#x27;s death signified the beginning of one of two disastrous trends in Lancastrian history. The next year, John remarried to Jacquetta of Luxembourg. For various political reasons, this alienated Anne&#x27;s brother, Duke Philip. Relations between John and Philip became cool, leading to the 1435 peace negotiations between Burgundy and Charles VII, the exiled king of France. Later that year, Philip formally broke the alliance with England.

<text>Riley
was a British motorcar and bicycle manufacturer from 1890. Riley became part of the Nuffield Organization in 1938 and was merged into the British Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968. In July 1969 British Leyland announced the immediate end of Riley production, although 1969 was a difficult year for the UK automotive industry and many cars from Riley&#x27;s inventory may have been first registered in 1970.

Today, the Riley trademark is owned by BMW.

==Riley Cycle Company==

The business began as the Bonnick Cycle Company of Coventry, England. In 1890 during the pedal cycle craze that swept Britain at the end of the 19th century William Riley Jr. who had interests in the textile industry purchased the business and in 1896 incorporated a company to own it named The Riley Cycle Company Limited. Later, cycle gear maker Sturmey Archer was added to the portfolio. Riley&#x27;s middle son, Percy, left school in the same year and soon began to dabble in automobiles. He built his first car at 16, in 1898, secretly, because his father did not approve. It featured the first mechanically operated inlet valve. By 1899, Percy Riley had moved from producing motorcycles to his first prototype four-wheeled quadricycle. Little is known about Percy Riley&#x27;s first motor car. It is, however, well attested that the engine featured mechanically operated cylinder valves at a time when other engines depended on the vacuum effect of the descending piston to suck the inlet valve(s) open. That was demonstrated some years later when Benz developed and patented a mechanically operated inlet valve process of their own but were unable to collect royalties on their system from British companies; the courts were persuaded that the system used by British auto-makers was based on the one pioneered by Percy, which had comfortably anticipated equivalent developments in Germany. In 1900, Riley sold a single three-wheeled automobile. Meanwhile, the elder of the Riley brothers, Victor Riley, although supportive of his brother&#x27;s embryonic motor-car enterprise, devoted his energies to the core bicycle business.

Riley&#x27;s founder William Riley remained resolutely opposed to diverting the resources of his bicycle business into motor cars, and in 1902 three of his sons, Victor, Percy and younger brother Allan Riley pooled resources, borrowed a necessary balancing amount from their mother and in 1903 established the separate Riley Engine Company, also in Coventry. A few years later the other two Riley brothers, Stanley and Cecil, having left school joined their elder brothers in the business. At first, the Riley Engine Company simply supplied engines for Riley motorcycles and also to Singer, a newly emerging motorcycle manufacturer in the area, but the Riley Engine Company soon began to focus on four-wheeled automobiles. Their Vee-Twin Tourer prototype, produced in 1905, can be considered the first proper Riley car. The Riley Engine Company expanded the next year. William Riley reversed his former opposition to his sons&#x27; preference for motorised vehicles and Riley Cycle halted motorcycle production in 1907 to focus on automobiles. Bicycle production also ceased in 1911.

In 1912, the Riley Cycle Company changed its name to Riley (Coventry) Limited as William Riley focused it on becoming a wire-spoked wheel supplier for the burgeoning motor industry, the detachable wheel having been invented (and patented) by Percy and distributed to over 180 motor manufacturers, and by 1912 the father&#x27;s business had also dropped automobile manufacture in order to concentrate capacity and resources on the wheels. Exploitation of this new and rapidly expanding lucrative business sector made commercial sense for William Riley, but the abandonment of his motorcycle and then of his automobile business which had been the principal customer for his sons&#x27; Riley Engine Company enforced a rethink on the engine business.

==Riley (Coventry) Limited==

In early 1913, Percy was joined by three of his brothers (Victor, Stanley, and Allan) to focus on manufacturing entire automobiles. The works was located near Percy&#x27;s Riley Engine Company. The first new model, the 17/30, was introduced at the London Motor Show that year. Soon afterwards, Stanley Riley founded yet another business, the Nero Engine Company, to produce his own 4-cylinder 10 hp (7.5 kW) car. Riley also began manufacturing aeroplane engines and became a key supplier in Britain&#x27;s buildup for World War I.

In 1918, after the war, the Riley companies were restructured. Nero joined Riley (Coventry) as the sole producer of automobiles. Riley Motor Manufacturing under the control of Allan Riley became Midland Motor Bodies, a coachbuilder for Riley. Riley Engine Company continued under Percy as the engine supplier. At this time, Riley&#x27;s blue diamond badge, designed by Harry Rush, also appeared. The motto was &quot;As old as the industry, as modern as the hour.&quot;

Riley grew rapidly through the 1920s and 1930s. The Riley Engine Company produced 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder engines, while Midland built more than a dozen different bodies. Riley models at this time included:
*Saloons: Adelphi, &#x27;Continental&#x27;(Close-coupled Touring Saloon), Deauville, Falcon, Kestrel, Mentone, Merlin, Monaco, Stelvio, Victor
*Coupes: Ascot, Lincock
*Tourers: Alpine, Lynx, Gamecock
*Sports: Brooklands, Imp, MPH, Sprite
*Limousines: Edinburgh, Winchester

Introduced in 1926 in a modest but innovatively-designed fabric bodied saloon, Percy Riley&#x27;s small capacity Riley 9 engine was a high revving unit; ground-breaking and ahead of its time in many respects. It has been called the most significant engine development of the 1920s. It has hemispherical combustion chambers and inclined overhead valves, with twin camshafts set high in the cylinder block, and valves operated by short pushrods. This provided power and efficiency without the servicing complexity of an overhead camshaft layout. It soon attracted the attention of tuners and builders of &#x27;specials&#x27; for sporting purposes. One such was engineer and driver J.G. Parry-Thomas, who conceived the Riley &#x27;Brooklands&#x27; (at first called the &#x27;9&#x27; Speed Model) in his workshops at the Brooklands racing circuit in Surrey. After Parry-Thomas was killed during a land speed record attempt in 1927, his close collaborator Reid Railton stepped in to finish the job. Officially backed by Riley, the Brooklands, along with later developments and variations such as the &#x27;Ulster&#x27; Imp, MPH, and Sprite, proved some of the most successful works and privateer racing cars of the late 1920s and early 1930s. At Le Mans in 1934, Rileys finished 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 12th, winning the Rudge-Whitworth Cup, the Team Prize, two class awards, and the Ladies&#x27; Prize. Rileys also distinguished themselves at the Ulster TT, at Brooklands itself, and at smaller events like hill climbs, while providing a platform for the success of motorsports&#x27; first women racing drivers such as Kay Petre, Dorothy Champney and Joan Richmond. Another engineer and driver, Freddie Dixon, was responsible for extensive improvements to engine and chassis tuning, creating a number of &#x27;specials&#x27; that exploited the basic Riley design still further, and contributed greatly to its success on the track.

For series production, the engine configuration was extended into a larger 12 horsepower &#x27;4&#x27;, six-cylinder and even V8 versions, powering an increasingly confusing range of touring and sports cars. The soundness and longevity of the engine design is illustrated by Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s early racing success after WW2 in pre-war Rileys, in particular his father&#x27;s Sprite. By about 1936, however, the business had overextended, with too many models and few common parts, and the emergence of SS Cars at Coventry was a direct challenge. Disagreements between the Riley brothers about the future direction of the enterprise grew. Victor Riley had set up a new ultra-luxury concern, Autovia, to produce a V8 saloon and limousine to compete with Rolls-Royce. By contrast, Percy, however, did not favour an entry into the luxury market, and the Riley Engine Company had been renamed PR Motors to be a high-volume supplier of engines and components. The rest of the Riley companies later became part of Nuffield and then BMC, but PR Motors remained independent. After the death of Percy Riley in 1941, his business began producing transmission components. It still exists today, producing marine and off-highway vehicle applications, as PRM Newage Limited based in Aldermans Green, Coventry. Percy&#x27;s widow Norah ran his business for many years, and was Britain&#x27;s businesswoman of the year in 1960.


==Nuffield Organization==


By 1937 Riley began to look to other manufacturers for partnerships. A contract with Briggs Motor Bodies of Dagenham to provide all-steel bodies for a cheaper, more mass-market saloon had already turned sour, with dozens of unsold bodies littering the factory. It had withdrawn from works racing after its most successful year, 1934, although it continued to supply engines for the ERA, a voiturette (Formula 2) racing car based on the supercharged 6-cylinder &#x27;White Riley&#x27;, developed by ERA founder Raymond Mays in the mid-thirties. BMW of Munich, Germany was interested in expanding its range into England. The Riley brothers were more interested in a larger British concern, and looked to Triumph Motor Company, also of Coventry, as a natural fit. However, in February 1938 negotiations were suspended. On 24 February the directors placed Riley (Coventry) Limited and Autovia in voluntary receivership. On 10 March the Triumph board announced merger negotiations had been dropped.

It was announced on 9 September 1938 that Lord Nuffield had bought the assets and goodwill of Riley Motors (Coventry) Limited from the receiver, and that on completion he would transfer ownership to Morris Motors Limited &quot;on terms which will show very considerable financial advantage to the company, resulting in further consolidation of its financial position&quot;. Mr Victor Riley then said this did not mean that the company would cease its activities. On 30 September, Victor Riley announced that Riley (Coventry) Limited would be wound up but it would appear that the proceeds of liquidation would be insufficient to meet the amount due to debenture holders. Nuffield paid £143,000 for the business, and formed a new company, Riley Motors Limited. However, in spite of the announced intention to be wound up, Riley (Coventry) Limited, perhaps for tax reasons, continued under the management of Victor Riley presumably with the necessary consents of debenture holders (part paid), creditors (nothing) and former shareholders (nothing). Nuffield passed ownership to his Morris Motors Limited for £100. Along with other Morris Motors subsidiaries Wolseley and MG, Riley was later promoted as a member of the Nuffield Organization. Riley Motors Limited seems to have begun trading at the end of the 1940s when Riley (Coventry) Limited disappeared.

Nuffield quickly took measures to firm up the Riley business. Autovia was discontinued, having built only 35 cars. Riley refocused on the 4-cylinder market with two engines: A 1.5-litre 12 hp engine and the &quot;Big Four&quot;, a 2.5-litre 16 hp unit (The hp figures are RAC Rating, and bear no relationship to bhp or kW). Only a few bodies were made before the Second World War began in 1939, and some components were shared with Morris for economies of scale. They incorporated a number of mechanical improvements – notably a Nuffield synchromesh gearbox – but were essentially interim models, and had less of a Riley character. The new management responded to the concerns of the marque&#x27;s loyal customers by re-introducing the Kestrel 2.5 litre Sports Saloon in updated form, but as the factory was turned over to wartime production, this was a short-lived development.

After the war, Riley installed the old engines in new models, based in concept on the 1936–38 &#x27;Continental&#x27;, a fashionable &#x27;notchback&#x27; design whose name had been changed prior to release to &#x27;Close-Coupled Touring Saloon&#x27; owing to feared objections from Rolls-Royce. The 1.5-litre engine was installed in the RMA, and the Big Four was installed in the RMB. Both engines, being derived from pre-war models, lent themselves as power units for specials and new specialist manufacturers, such as Donald Healey. The RM series, sold under the &quot;Magnificent Motoring&quot; slogan, became a re-affirmation of Riley values in both road behaviour and appearance. &#x27;Torsionic&#x27; front independent suspension and steering design inspired by the Citroën &quot;Traction Avant&quot; provided precise handling. Their flowing lines were particularly well-balanced, combining pre-war coachbuilt elegance with more modern features, such as headlamps faired into the front wings. The RMC, a 3-seater roadster, was an unsuccessful attempt to break into the US market. The RMD was an elegant 4/5-seater two-door drophead, of which few were made. The 1.5-litre RME and 2.5-litre RMF were later developments of the saloon versions, which continued in production into the mid-1950s.

Nuffield removed Victor Riley in 1947. In early 1949 the Coventry works were made an extension of Morris Motors&#x27; engine branch. Riley production was consolidated with MG at Abingdon. Wolseley production was moved to Cowley. Nuffield&#x27;s marques were then organised in a similar way to those of General Motors: Morris was the economy, mass-market brand, and Wolseley the luxury marque. Aside from their small saloons, MG largely offered performance cars, especially with their open sportsters, while Riley sought to be both sporty and luxurious. With Wolseley also competing for the top position, however, the range was crowded and confused.

==British Motor Corporation==

The confusion became more acute in 1952 with the merger of Nuffield and Austin as the British Motor Corporation. Now, Riley was positioned between MG and Wolseley and most Riley models became, like those, little more than badge-engineered versions of Austin / Morris designs.

However, the first all-new Riley under BMC was designated the RMH, and because of its distinctive engine and suspension design, it has been called &#x27;the last real Riley&#x27;. This was the Pathfinder, with Riley&#x27;s familiar 2.5-litre four developed to produce 110 bhp. (The RMG &#x27;Wayfarer&#x27;, a projected 1.5-litre version, was rejected as underpowered). The Pathfinder body was later reworked and, with a different engine and rear suspension, sold as the Wolseley 6/90. The Riley lost its distinct (though externally subtle) differences in 1958, and the 6/90 of that year was available badge engineered as a Riley Two-Point-Six. Although this was the only postwar 6-cylinder Riley, its C-Series engine was actually less powerful than the Riley Big Four that it replaced. This was to be the last large Riley, with the model dropped in May 1959 and Riley refocusing on the under-2-litre market segment.

Riley and Wolseley were linked in small cars as well. Launched in 1957, the Riley One-Point-Five and Wolseley 1500 were based on the unused but intended replacement for the Morris Minor. They shared their exteriors, but the Riley was marketed as the more performance-oriented option, having an uprated engine, twin SU carburettors, and a close-ratio gearbox. With its good handling, compact, sports-saloon styling and well-appointed interior, the One-Point-Five quite successfully recaptured the character of the 1930s light saloons.

At the top of the Riley range for April 1959 was the new Riley 4/Sixty-Eight saloon. Again, it was a badge-engineered version of other BMC models. The steering was perhaps the worst feature of the car, being Austin-derived cam and peg rather than the rack and pinion of the One-Point-Five. Overall, it could not provide the sharp and positive drive associated with previous Rileys, being based on the modest Austin Cambridge and Morris Oxford. Sharing many features with the similarly upmarket MG Magnette Mark III and Wolseley 15/60, it was the most luxurious of the versions, which were all comfortable and spacious, and (nominally) styled by Farina. In 1961 the car was refreshed, along with its siblings, and rebadged as the 4/Seventy-Two.

1961 saw the introduction of the Riley Elf based on the original Mini. Again, a Wolseley model, the Hornet, was introduced simultaneously. This time, the Riley and Wolseley versions differed visually by their grilles, but were mechanically identical.

The final Riley of the BMC era was the Kestrel 1100/1300, based on the Austin/Morris 1100/1300 saloon (BMC ADO16). This also had siblings in Wolseley and MG versions. After objections from Riley enthusiasts, the Kestrel name was dropped for the last facelift in 1968, the Riley 1300.

Between 1966 and 1968, a series of mergers took place in the British motor industry, ultimately creating the British Leyland Motor Corporation, whose management embarked on a programme of rationalisation, in which the Riley marque was an early casualty. The badge began to be discontinued in many export markets almost immediately. A BLMC press release was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; of 9 July 1969: &quot;British Leyland will stop making Riley cars from today. &quot;With less than 1 per cent of the home market, they are not viable&quot; the company said last night. The decision will end 60 years of motoring history. No other marques in the British Leyland stable are likely to suffer the same fate &quot;in the foreseeable future&quot;. The last Riley badged car was produced in 1969, and the marque became dormant.

For many enthusiasts, the name of Riley still resonates in the 21st century. In spite of the decline of the marque under BMC and British Leyland, surviving Rileys of the period are now popular, with the Riley &#x27;face&#x27; and badge lending a distinctive character. Three owners&#x27; clubs cater for enthusiasts: the Riley Motor Club, which was founded in 1925 and caters for all Rileys; the Riley Register, which is exclusively for Rileys built up until 1940; and the Riley RM Club, which is exclusively for the RM series, built between 1946 and 1957. Many original racing Rileys compete regularly in VSCC (Vintage Sports Car Club) events, and pre-war racing &#x27;specials&#x27; continue to be created from tired or derelict saloons.

==Current ownership and possible revival==
After buying Rover Group in 1994, BMW planned to revive Riley. At a dinner hosted by the Association of Riley Clubs celebrating the centenary of Riley, BMW Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder, who was an enthusiast for many historical British marques, announced that the Riley name was to return. He stated that development of a new model was to begin immediately, with Rover engineering director Nick Stephenson in charge of the project. It was later revealed that BMW had developed a three-door concept car based on the Rover 75, named the Riley Coupe. The project was later cancelled after Pischetsrieder&#x27;s removal in 1999, and BMW&#x27;s subsequent divestment of the MG Rover Group in 2000. The rights to the Triumph and Riley marques, along with Mini, were retained by BMW.

In 2007 William Riley, who claims to be a descendant of the Riley family (although this has been disputed), formed MG Sports and Racing Europe Ltd. This new business acquired assets relating to the MG XPower SV sports car from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the administrators of the defunct MG Rover Group, and intended to continue production of the model as the MG XPower WR. Production never began.

In September 2010, &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine reported that BMW was considering reviving the Riley brand as a variant of the redesigned MINI. This would most likely be a luxury version, inspired by the Elf of 1961–9, with a &#x27;notchback&#x27; (booted) body, and the interior trimmed in wood and leather in the manner of earlier Rileys. No sources were quoted, however, and in the absence of any statement from BMW reports of the possible resurrection of Riley must be regarded as highly speculative. &quot;Autocar&quot; reiterated this information in April 2016.
