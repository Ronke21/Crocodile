<text>Operation Adler was the code name designated by the Luftwaffe for their air offensive against Great Britain in the summer of 1940. The defensive side of this operation was known as the Battle of Britain. This offensive was part of an ambitious campaign, namely the amphibious invasion of England. The Luftwaffe bore the responsibility of neutralizing the Royal Air Force (RAF) and its capability to thwart the planned invasion. Operational planners were tasked with developing a plan to systematically destroy Great Britain&#x27;s ability to wage war. This strategic air offensive was only one part of the overall campaign for the eventual invasion of England. The first step in this operation would be attaining air superiority for the invading force. Hermann Göring, the Luftwaffe Commander, violated all seven &#x27;principles of war&#x27; as stated in U.S. Army Manual FM 100-5, but still came very close to defeating the RAF. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s targeting of London was seen by the British as a fatal mistake. Adlertag (Eagle Day) was the Goring designated code name for the first day of German offensive air operations aimed at destroying the RAF.

<doc id="414455" wikidata="Q3444160" url="?curid=414455" title="Bomberman">
<text>is a video game franchise created by Shinichi Nakamoto and Shigeki Fujiwara, originally developed by Hudson Soft and currently owned by Konami. The original game, also known as Bakudan Otoko (爆弾男, &quot;Bomb Man&quot;), was released in Japan in July 1983 and has since spawned multiple sequels and spin-offs released on numerous platforms, as well as several anime and manga adaptations.

As of 2023, the series has sold approximately 16 million physical copies, and 7.2 million paid mobile downloads for a total of 23.2 million.

==Gameplay==

Most games in the &quot;Bomberman&quot; franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb&#x27;s explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement. In addition to the main maze-based &quot;Bomberman&quot; games, some spin-off titles involve adventure, platformer, puzzle, and kart racing gameplay.

== Story ==

===Plot===
Several games in the series are loosely connected through recurring characters and settings.

The 1985 game for Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment System (and &quot;Atomic Punk&quot; for Game Boy) begins with &quot;Bomberman&quot; (the eponymous character of the game) who worked day in and day out making bombs in an underground compound, but he dreamed of liberty, so he plotted his escape. After hearing a rumor that robots reaching the surface become human, he decides to escape. He was aided by the only skill he knew, bomb making. He uses the bombs to destroy the enemies preventing his escape and to clear blocked walls. When he reaches the surface, he transforms into an organic human being and becomes known as the &quot;Runner&quot;. This storyline is not present in some versions, such as &quot;Bomberman Party Edition&quot;, and this setting was largely abandoned but used for connections with Hudson&#x27;s &quot;Lode Runner&quot; games and &quot;&quot;.

In the &quot;Bomberman&quot; for the TurboGrafx-16, Bomberman is used as a prototype for further Bomberman robots by Dr. Mitsumori. To distinguish him from other Bombermen, the main character is given the name White Bomberman (or White Bomber). In earlier appearances, the second Bomberman model (known as Black Bomberman) was usually the rival or the main antagonist.

In the &quot;Super Bomberman&quot; series, the two characters would regularly join forces to handle bigger threats, most notably the evil alien Professor Bagura and the Five Dastardly Bombers, the Hige Hige Bandits (led by Mujoe and Dr. Mechado), as well as a mysterious rival known as Regulus.

=== Characters ===
* Bomberman, also referred to as &quot;White Bomberman&quot;, &quot;White Bomber&quot;, &quot;Cheerful White&quot; (in &quot;Bomberman Land Touch!&quot;), &quot;Bomber John&quot; (in &quot;Bomberman Touch&quot;), and (in Japan) &quot;Shirobon&quot;, is the hero of the series. In the standard games, he is the protagonist and player-character. He is usually portrayed as the heroic yet cheerful type, often saving his home planet from disaster. Like all Bombermen, he has the ability to generate bombs in his hands. In later games, such as &quot;Bomberman Max&quot; and &quot;Bomberman Tournament&quot;, he is shown to be part of an interplanetary police force stationed at Bomber Base. The White Bomberman also made appearances in other games, such as &quot;Wario Blast: Featuring Bomberman!&quot;, a Bomberman game featuring Bomberman alongside Nintendo mascot Mario&#x27;s rival, Wario (although that was not the case in Japan). He also appears in &quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&quot;—a Hudson fighting game with characters from Hudson Soft, Konami, and Takara, and in the Nintendo fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a non-playable Assist Trophy and as a Mii Fighter outfit. He even makes a giant playable appearance in &quot;Star Parodier&quot;, a spoof of the &quot;Star Soldier&quot; series, which is also developed by Hudson Soft. He has been featured in three anime series; &quot;Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden&quot; and &quot;Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden V&quot; are based on the marble shooting game B-Daman, while &quot;Bomberman Jetters&quot; inspired the video game of the same name. In the anime &quot;Bomberman Jetters&quot;, he had an older brother named Mighty. and he also made a cameo appearance in the 2015 film, Pixels.
* Black Bomberman (&quot;Cool Black&quot; in &quot;Bomberman Land Touch!&quot;) looks identical to Bomberman, only he is colored black and doesn&#x27;t have white pants. In many of his first appearances, he was shown to be the main rival of Bomberman, often performing acts such as robbing banks to fight him. He eventually becomes a gradual friend of Bomberman, and acts as the second player in the two-player story modes of the games. Hudson has given him a cool and collected personality in the later games. In his first appearance, he also led Red Bomber, Blue Bomber, Green Bomber, and Yellow Bomber.
* Max first appears in &quot;Bomberman Max&quot; as one of the main characters. He is somewhat competitive and arrogant, as shown in his first appearance that despite the urgency of the mission, he challenges Bomberman to a contest to see who can gather the most Charaboms. Max wears a black suit of armor with a helmet that completely hides his face. He is also a playable character in the game &quot;Bomberman Jetters&quot;, where he joins Bomberman in the fight against the Hige Hige Bandits again, and he is an unlockable character for the battle mode of &quot;Bomberman Generation&quot;. He is also unlockable in &quot;Bomberman 2&quot; for Nintendo DS. His backstory is greatly expanded upon in &quot;Bomberman Tournament&quot;, revealing him to be a native of the planet Phantarion who became a cyborg due to injuries sustained during the first invasion attempt of the Five Dastardly Bombers.
* Dr. Ein (also known as Professor Ein) is a scientist who assists Bomberman. He is eccentric and doesn&#x27;t seem to show many emotions. He is fat, has white spiky hair, and glasses with spirals covering the lenses. Despite never having a playable appearance, one of the customization sets in &quot;Bomberman Live&quot; lets Bomberman wear Dr. Ein&#x27;s lab coat and glasses.
* Charabon (also known as Karabon) are small creatures that help Bomberman progress by granting him abilities. First appearing in &quot;Bomberman Max&quot;, each game featuring Charabon features a unique set of them. Bomberman often finds Charabon trapped in cages, and he can partner with one to use its ability. He can also fuse them together and battle them against others. Pommy is a recurring Charabon, who first appears in &quot;Bomberman 64: The Second Attack&quot;, where he is a loyal, but cowardly sidekick and a mimic. He is capable of shooting lightning and taking on many different forms. In &quot;Bomberman Tournament&quot;, he can teleport. Charabons have four possible elemental attributes, of which they can have up to three: Fire, represented by dinosaurs and dragons; Water, represented by fish and mollusks; Earth, represented by beasts; and Electric, represented by Pommy&#x27;s various forms. The elemental attributes have a simple rock-paper-scissors relationship, with Water being strong against Fire, Fire being strong against Earth, Earth being strong against Electric, and Electric being strong against Water (Water and Earth are neutral against each other and usually don&#x27;t harm each other; the same is true of Fire and Electric).
* Louie (also known as Rooi) are kangaroo-like animals with rabbit ears who help Bomberman by letting him ride on their backs. In &quot;Super Bomberman 4&quot;, they were replaced by various animals, and in &quot;Saturn Bomberman&quot; by the dinosaur-like Tyra / Tirra.
* The Bad Bombers (a.k.a. the Five Dastardly Bombers) are a gang of five recurring boss enemies in several games of the series. They were produced by Professor Bagura. Magnet Bomber sports a scarf-like cape, has a magnet shape attached to his helmet, and uses bombs that are attracted to his enemies. Golem Bomber is much larger than the others and he utilizes fire bombs. Pretty Bomber is distinguished from her male counterparts by her pink skirt, yellow neckerchief, and the large yellow heart attached to her helmet. She also appears as a close friend to Bomberman in several games, where both White and Black Bomber are attracted to her. Brain Bomber(known as Phantom Bomber in &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot;) is the engineer of the group, who wears a cloak and has the symbol of a crown on his helmet. He is shorter than the other characters and sometimes floats above the group. Plasma Bomber is the leader. Plasma Bomber wears a neckerchief and has a lightning bolt attached to his helmet that can create electric currents.
* Professor Bagura (also known as Bagular, Burglar or Bugler) is the main villain in many of the games. He resembles a blue and white, large, elderly man with a bushy white beard, a monocle, and a cape. He first appears as the main villain of &quot;Bomberman &#x27;94&quot;, in which he attempts to run a comet-disguised ship into Planet Bomber after throwing it into chaos. He later appears in several games, including &quot;Super Bomberman 3&quot;, &quot;Super Bomberman 4&quot;, &quot;Bomberman Hero&quot;, &quot;Bomberman World&quot;, and &quot;Neo Bomberman&quot;. In some odd appearances, he is reduced to a brain that wants to rebuild an empire and wants revenge on Bomberman. In the anime, he is the true leader of the Hige Hige Bandits, with Mujoe as his second-in-command. Dr. Mechado also serves the group by creating technology, such as the Hige-Hige Bandits, small robotic minions who are very weak and serve under Mujoe.

<doc id="414457" wikidata="Q264477" url="?curid=414457" title="Peter Bottomley">
<text>Sir Peter James Bottomley (born 30 July 1944) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1975 until 2024, last representing Worthing West. First elected at a by-election in the former constituency of Woolwich West, he served as its MP until its abolition at the 1983 general election, and then for the Eltham constituency which replaced it, until 1997. He moved to his last constituency at the 1997 general election, winning seven times before losing to Labour&#x27;s Beccy Cooper in the 2024 general election.

Following the 2019 general election, Bottomley became the longest-serving MP and therefore Father of the House until the next general election. He was also the first Father to be unseated rather than retire or die in the position.

==Early life and career==
Peter Bottomley was born in Newport, Shropshire, the son of Sir James Bottomley, classical scholar and a wartime army officer who later joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and Barbara, &quot;née&quot; Vardon, a social worker. He was baptised at St Swithun&#x27;s Parish Church at Cheswardine in Shropshire, where his parents had married. After seven school changes before the age of 11, he was educated at a junior high school in Washington, D.C., and then privately educated at Westminster School before gaining an economics degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, following his father, grandfather, father-in-law and father-in-law&#x27;s father to the college. His supervisor was James Mirrlees, who later gained the Nobel Prize for Economics.

Before university, he worked around Australia, including three weeks teaching at Geelong Grammar School deputising for the explorer and teacher John Béchervaise, and unloading trucks in Melbourne docks. In between, he spent a week walking in Mount Field National Park with Tenzing Norgay. After university, he became a lorry driver and joined the Transport and General Workers Union, before moving on to industrial sales and industrial relations. In the early 1970s, he co-founded the Neighbourhood Council in South Lambeth, resulting in the creation of football pitches and other facilities at Larkhall Park. His last job before entering Parliament was putting lights outside theatres and cinemas in London&#x27;s West End. Bottomley joined the Conservative Party in 1972, at the age of 28.

==Member of Parliament==

===On the backbenches===
Bottomley contested the Vauxhall constituency in the 1973 GLC election and Woolwich West parliamentary seat in the February and October general elections of 1974, failing to defeat the sitting Labour MP William Hamling. Hamling died on 20 March 1975, and in the space of 18 months, Bottomley faced the electors of Woolwich West for a third time at the by-election on 26 June 1975. At this by-election he was elected as MP for Woolwich West with 48.8% of the vote and a majority of 2,382.

In 1978 he became the President of the Conservative Trade Unionists for two years. Bottomley became a trustee with Christian Aid in 1978 until 1984. In 1978, as a member of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, he campaigned to prevent or to delay the anticipated assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero and represented the British Council of Churches at the Saint’s funeral in El Salvador in 1980 when 14 people died around him. In 1979, days before the fall of the Labour Government, he made a visit to Washington, D.C., to indicate that Margaret Thatcher, if she became Prime Minister, would not lift sanctions on Southern Rhodesia nor recognise the government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa. He was for some years a member of the Conservative Monday Club as well as a member of the Bow Group and Tory Reform Group.

At the 1979 general election, Bottomley was re-elected as MP for Woolwich West with a decreased vote share of 47.3% and an increased majority of 2,609.

He has been chairman of the Church of England&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Society, a trustee of Mind and of Nacro and on the policy committee of One Parent Families. He served with John Sentamu on the successor committee to the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s commission that produced the report &quot;Faith in the City&quot;, and chaired the churches&#x27; review group on the Churches Main Committee. He was a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee and served as the Parliamentary Warden at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster. He led the United Kingdom delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). He is an Hon. Vice President of WATCH, Women and the Church, supporting full equal acceptance of females.

In 1982, he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Cranley Onslow. At the 1983 general election, Bottomley&#x27;s constituency of Woolwich West was subject to boundary changes and was renamed Eltham; he won the new seat with 47.9% of the vote and a majority of 7,592. Following the election, Peter Bottomley became the PPS to the Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Security, Norman Fowler.

===Member of the Thatcher Government===
Bottomley became a member of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government when he was appointed as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Employment (industrial relations, health and safety, European issues) in 1984, moving sideways to the Department of Transport in 1986 to become the Minister of Roads and Traffic. He opened many news roads as Minister, including the Bulwick A43 Bypass in April 1986. In 1989 he moved sideways again to the Northern Ireland Office (environment and agriculture). He was dropped by Thatcher in 1990, when he briefly became PPS to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke.

At the 1987 general election, Bottomley was re-elected as MP for Eltham with a decreased vote share of 47.5% and a decreased majority of 6,460.

===Return to the backbenches===
Since 1990, Bottomley was a backbencher, described as a maverick, &quot;supporting a range of seemingly perverse causes&quot;.

At the 1992 general election, Bottomley was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 46% and a decreased majority of 1,666. Bottomley decided not to re-contest Eltham after major boundary changes. He sought nomination elsewhere. At the 1997 general election, Bottomley contested the newly formed constituency of Worthing West, where he was elected with 46.1% of the vote and a majority of 7,713.

Bottomley was re-elected as MP for Worthing West at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 47.5% and an increased majority of 9,037. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 47.6% and an increased majority of 9,379.

In 2009, Bottomley was the vice-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Flag Group. In 2011, he was in more Parliamentary groups than any other MP. He was vice-chairman of All-Party United Nations Group and vice-chairman of All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Transport Safety.

At the 2010 general election, Bottomley was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 51.7% and an increased majority of 11,729. He was again re-elected at the 2015 general election with a decreased vote share of 51.5% and an increased majority of 16,855.

At the 2016 referendum, Bottomley was in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union.

Bottomley was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with an increased vote share of 55.4% and a decreased majority of 12,090.

An advocate for reducing the voting age to 16, Bottomley was a co-founder and Vice Chair of the APPG on Votes at 16 and a supporter of the Votes at 16 campaign.

Bottomley co-chaired the APPG on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood, campaigning to get justice for those affected by the tainted blood scandal. During a debate in Parliament on 24 November 2016, he urged Prime Minister Theresa May to look at the issue. Bottomley was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with an increased vote share of 55.8% and an increased majority of 14,823, becoming the longest continuous-serving MP and thus Father of the House. Two MPs had served continuously since the 1970 general election. They left Parliament in 2019: Kenneth Clarke, the previous Father, retired and Dennis Skinner lost re-election.

==Personal life==

In 1967, Bottomley married Virginia Garnett who later became a Cabinet Minister (Health Secretary), and a life peer in 2005 as Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone.

His brother was a Labour Lambeth councillor; his brother-in-law was Conservative Mayor of Cambridge. His niece is Kitty Ussher, the economist, former Labour MP and Minister. His nephew is Crown Court Judge Silas James Reid, known for sentencing climate protestors. His great-grandfather Sir Richard Robinson led the Municipal Reformers to victory in the 1907 London County Council election.

In 1989, Bottomley successfully sued &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;News of the World&quot; for allegations connected with his support of the union membership of a social worker in his constituency accused of misbehaviour in a children&#x27;s home. In 1995, he was awarded £40,000 against the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; for an article which accused him of betraying the paratrooper Private Lee Clegg, who was in jail for the murder of a joyrider in Northern Ireland, by appearing at a meeting with Martin McGuinness.

In 2002–2003, Bottomley was Master of the Worshipful Company of Drapers.

In November 2003, Bottomley was banned from driving for six months following several speeding offences. The local newspaper organised an electric bike for him.

Bottomley was knighted in the 2011 New Year Honours for public service.

<text>David Bruce Vitter (born May 3, 1961) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Louisiana from 2005 to 2017. A member of the Republican Party, Vitter served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1992 to 1999 and in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1999 to 2005.

Vitter was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. He was the first Republican to represent Louisiana in the Senate since the Reconstruction Era, and the first ever Republican to be popularly elected. In 2007, Vitter admitted to and apologized for past involvement with prostitution as part of a Washington, D.C. escort service which gained much notoriety and while not affecting his 2010 election, is believed to have played a part in his loss of the 2015 gubernatorial election. In 2010, Vitter won a second Senate term by defeating Democratic U.S. Representative Charlie Melançon.

Vitter unsuccessfully ran for governor to succeed the term-limited Bobby Jindal in the 2015 gubernatorial election. He lost the general election to Democrat John Bel Edwards. While conceding defeat to Edwards, Vitter announced that he would not seek reelection to his Senate seat in 2016 and would retire from office at the completion of his term. Following the conclusion of his second Senate term, Vitter became a lobbyist.

==Early life and education==

David Bruce Vitter was born on May 3, 1961, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is the son of Audrey Malvina (née St. Raymond) and Albert Leopold Vitter. Vitter graduated in 1979 from De La Salle High School in New Orleans. While a student at De La Salle, Vitter participated in the Close Up Washington civic education program. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard College in 1983; a second B.A. from Magdalen College, Oxford in 1985, as a Rhodes Scholar; and a Juris Doctor degree in 1988 from the Tulane University Law School in New Orleans. He was a practicing lawyer, and adjunct law professor at Tulane and Loyola University New Orleans.

Vitter and his wife Wendy, a former prosecutor, have four children. Vitter&#x27;s brother Jeffrey is a computer scientist who has served as chancellor of the University of Mississippi from January 2016 to January 2019.

==Early political career==
===Louisiana House of Representatives===
Vitter was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1992 to 1999.

Vitter has argued for ethics reform and term limits since he was in the Louisiana Legislature in the early 1990s. As a Louisiana state legislator, Vitter successfully pushed through a term limits amendment to the state constitution to oust the largely Democratic legislature. The first election legislators affected by the reform occurred in 2007. In order to leverage the term limits advantage in that election, Vitter formed a Political Action Committee with the goal of winning a legislative Republican majority. While the Republicans saw gains, the Democrats maintained majority control.

Vitter opposed gambling during his tenure in the Louisiana House.

===United States House of Representatives===
Vitter won a special election to Louisiana&#x27;s 1st congressional district in 1999, succeeding Republican U.S. Representative Bob Livingston, who resigned after disclosure that he had committed adultery. In the initial vote on May 1, 1999, former Congressman and Governor David C. Treen finished first with 36,719 votes (25 percent). Vitter was second, with 31,741 (22 percent), and white nationalist David Duke finished third with 28,055 votes (19 percent). Monica L. Monica, a Republican ophthalmologist, had 16 percent; State Representative Bill Strain, a conservative Democrat, finished fifth with 11 percent; and Rob Couhig, a Republican lawyer and the owner of New Orleans&#x27;s minor league baseball team, garnered 6 percent. In the runoff, Vitter defeated Treen 51–49 percent.

In 2000 and 2002, Vitter was re-elected with more than 80 percent of the vote in what had become a safe Republican district.

In 2001, Vitter co-authored legislation to restrict the number of physicians allowed to prescribe RU-486, a drug used in medical abortions. The bill died in committee.

In 2003, Vitter proposed to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In 2004, he said, &quot;This is a real outrage. The Hollywood left is redefining the most basic institution in human history...We need a U.S. Senator who will stand up for Louisiana values, not Massachusetts values.&quot;

===2003 gubernatorial election===
In 2002, Vitter was preparing to run for governor in 2003, with the incumbent, Republican Mike Foster, prevented by term limits from running again. But in June 2002, shortly before the &quot;Louisiana Weekly&quot; reported on a claim from Vincent Bruno, a campaign worker for Treen in 1999, about Vitter&#x27;s alleged relationship with a prostitute, Vitter dropped out of the governor&#x27;s race, saying he and his wife were dealing with marital problems.

Bruno said on a New Orleans–based radio show that he had been told by a prostitute that she had interactions with Vitter. However, Treen and his campaign decided to not publicize this information during the election.

==United States Senate==
===2004 election===

In 2004, Vitter ran to replace Democrat John Breaux in the U.S. Senate.

During the campaign, Vitter was accused by a member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee of having had a lengthy affair with a prostitute in New Orleans. Vitter responded that the allegation was &quot;absolutely and completely untrue&quot; and that it was &quot;just crass Louisiana politics.&quot;

On November 2, 2004, Vitter won the jungle primary, garnering a majority of the vote, while the rest of the vote was mostly split among the Democratic contenders.

Vitter was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. Senator. The previous Republican Senator, William Pitt Kellogg, was chosen by the state legislature in 1876, in accordance with the process used before the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution went into effect in 1914.

===2010 election===
Vitter began fundraising for his 2010 reelection run in December 2008. He raised $731,000 in the first quarter of 2009 and $2.5 million for his 2010 campaign. He had wide leads against potential Democratic opponents in aggregate general election polling. He faced intraparty opposition from Chet D. Traylor of Monroe, a former associate justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, in the August 28 Republican primary election and defeated him.

He faced the Democratic U.S. Representative Charlie Melançon of Napoleonville in the November 2 general election. State Representative Ernest Wooton of Belle Chasse in Plaquemines Parish, an Independent, also ran. On November 4, 2010, Vitter was re-elected as Louisiana Senator, defeating his Democratic rival, Melancon. Vitter got 715,304 votes while Melancon got 476,423 votes. Vitter received about 57% of the total vote while Melancon got 38%. The Independent candidate Wooton finished with 8,167 votes, or 1 percent of the total cast.

===Tenure===
Vitter has identified himself as a political conservative throughout his political career. His legislative agenda includes positions ranging from anti-abortion to pro-gun rights while legislating against gambling, same-sex marriage, civil unions, federal funding for abortion providers, increases in the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, the United Nations, and amnesty for America&#x27;s illegal immigrants. Vitter&#x27;s stated positions include a balanced budget constitutional amendment, abolishing the federal and state estate tax, increasing local police forces, and an assortment of health care, tax and national defense reforms.

After conceding defeat to John Bel Edwards in the 2015 Louisiana gubernatorial election, Vitter announced that he would not seek reelection to his Senate seat in 2016 and would retire from office at the completion of his term.

====Abortion====
In October 2007, Vitter introduced an amendment barring all federal public funds to health care providers and Planned Parenthood that provide services that include abortion. Federal law bars any funding to directly finance elective abortions in accordance with the Hyde amendment. Vitter argued that the funds are used for overhead costs that benefit the abortion services. The amendment failed to pass. Following the rejection, Vitter and others urged
the Senate to pass a similar bill introduced by Vitter in
January 2007. The bill failed to pass.

In January 2008, Vitter proposed an amendment to prohibit the funding of abortions with Indian Health Service funds except in the case of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is at risk. The amendment would have held future presidential administrations to an executive principle first crafted in 1982 by the Ronald Reagan White House. Vitter&#x27;s amendment passed the Senate but later was stalled in the House.

Later that year, Vitter co-sponsored the Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act which – along with other oversight regulations – required doctors performing abortions to have the authority granted by a nearby hospital to admit patients. The bill was never reported to committee.

====Abstinence education====
Vitter advocated abstinence-only sex education, emphasizing abstinence over sex education that includes information about birth control, drawing criticism from Planned Parenthood. He said, &quot;Abstinence education is a public health strategy focused on risk avoidance that aims to help young people avoid exposure to harm...by teaching teenagers that saving sex until marriage and remaining faithful afterwards is the best choice for health and happiness.&quot;

====Automotive industry bailout====
Vitter was one of 35 Senators to vote against the Big 3 Bailout bill. The financial bailout package was for GM, Chrysler, and Ford, but failed to pass on December 11, 2008. During the Senate debate Vitter referred to the approach of giving the automotive industry a financial package before they restructured as &quot;ass-backwards&quot;. He soon apologized for the phrasing of the comment, which did not appear in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.

====BP Horizon oil spill====
In response to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill at an offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico threatening the coast of Louisiana, Vitter introduced legislation along with Jeff Sessions of Alabama to increase the liability cap of an oil company from $75 million to its most recent annual profits (or $150 million if greater). In the case of BP, the owner of the oil lease, its liability would be $20 billion. Vitter later introduced an amendment that would remove the cap entirely for this particular spill. Competing Democratic proposals would have raised the liability to $10 billion regardless of profits or removed the cap altogether. Sessions argued that large caps unrelated to company profits would harm smaller companies.

====Chemical safety====
In May 2013, Vitter introduced the Chemical Safety Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act, which would have regulated the introduction of new or already existing chemicals. The bill would have given additional authority to the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate chemicals and streamline the patchwork of state laws on chemicals under federal authority.

====Child protection====
In April 2008, Vitter introduced an amendment to continue funding the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act which was excluded from the 2008/2009 budget. The federal program maintains a national sex offender registry, provides resources for tracking down unregistered sex offenders and increases penalties for the sexual assault of children. His amendment received bipartisan support.

====Children&#x27;s health insurance program====
In September 2007, Vitter opposed an increase of $35 billion for the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the national program to provide health care for children from families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance. He said he preferred that private health insurance provide the needed care and deemed the bill as &quot;Hillarycare&quot;, a reference to the 1993 Clinton health care plan created by Hillary Clinton which proposed universal health care.

====Ethics and term limits====
Vitter refused to pledge to a voluntary term limit when running for the U.S. Congress in 1999. His opponent characterized this stance as hypocritical, and Vitter countered that unless it were universally applied, the loss of seniority would disadvantage his district. As a Senator, he has proposed term limit constitutional amendments for members of Congress three times. Vitter eventually decided to retire from the Senate in 2016 after serving two terms.

In 2007, in response to lobbying scandals involving, among others, Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham, Congress passed a lobbying and ethics reform package to which Vitter proposed a package of five amendments. The Senate approved three that limited which legislators&#x27; spouses could lobby the Senate, created criminal penalties for legislators and executive branch officials who falsify financial reports, and doubled the penalties for lobbyists who failed to comply with disclosure requirements. The Senate rejected prohibiting legislators from paying their families with campaign funds with some saying it was unrelated to the current legislation and others that the payments were not a problem. Additionally, they tabled his proposal to define Indian tribes as corporations and its members as shareholders so that they are required to contribute to candidates through political action committees instead of their tribal treasury. Senators objected saying that they are already subjected to campaign laws for unincorporated entities and individuals and that the proposal was singling them out unfairly. The reform package became law in September 2007.

In 2009, Vitter and Democratic former Senator Russ Feingold announced an effort to end automatic pay raises for members of Congress.

====Franken Amendment====

In October 2009, the Senate passed Democratic Senator Al Franken&#x27;s amendment to the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that would forbid federal contractors from forcing victims of sexual assault, battery and discrimination to submit to binding arbitration (where a third-party typically chosen by the contractor adjudicates) and thereby prohibiting them from going to court. The impetus for the amendment came from the story of Jamie Leigh Jones who alleged that she was drugged and gang-raped by employees of Halliburton/KBR, a federal contractor.

The amendment passed 68 to 30 with all opposition coming from Republicans including Vitter (all four female Republicans, six other Republicans and all present Democrats voted for passage). Vitter&#x27;s 2010 Democratic Senatorial opponent Charlie Melancon criticized Vitter for his vote saying, &quot;David Vitter has refused to explain why he voted to allow taxpayer-funded companies to sweep rape charges under the rug. We can only guess what his reasons were.&quot; However, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Kathleen Parker argued that the 30 senators were being &quot;unfairly smeared for doing the harder thing, maybe even for the right reasons.&quot;

Republican senators said they voted against it because it was unenforceable, a position also taken by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Obama administration. However, the DOD and the White House stated they agreed with the intent of the legislation and suggested it would be better if it was broadened to prohibit the use of arbitration in cases of sexual assault for any business contract, not just federal contractors. Senators explained their vote against the legislation by saying it was a political attack on Halliburton and that the Senate shouldn&#x27;t regulate contracts. The latter argument is countered with many examples of similar restrictions on contractors such as discrimination, bonuses and health care. Others felt it was unconstitutional and that arbitration is useful in resolving disputes, often faster, privately and cheaper.

Later, a Baton Rouge rape survivor confronted Vitter at a town hall meeting saying, &quot;[it] meant everything to me that I was able to put the person who attacked me behind bars ... How can you support a law that tells a rape victim that she does not have the right to defend herself?&quot; Vitter replied, &quot;The language in question did not say that in any way shape or form.&quot;

====Gambling====
Vitter opposed a bid by the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians to build a casino in Louisiana, arguing that the build site was not historically part of their tribal lands. He lobbied the Interior Department and included language in an appropriations bill to stop the casino. Although the Interior Department gave its approval, the casino has not yet been approved by the state. The Jena chief accused Vitter of ties with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who simultaneously lobbied against the casino. The chairman of the Senate committee investigating the lobbyist said, &quot;The committee has seen absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Senator Vitter&#x27;s opposition to (the proposed casino) had to do with anything other than his long-standing opposition to gambling.&quot; In 2007 and 2008, Vitter introduced a bill to prohibit Indian casinos such as Jena&#x27;s. Neither bill became law.

====Gun rights====
Rated &quot;A&quot; by the NRA Political Victory Fund, Vitter has been a consistent defender of gun rights. In April 2006, in response to firearm confiscations in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Vitter was the Senate sponsor of the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act, to prohibit federal funding for the confiscation of legally held firearms during a disaster. Later, Vitter included the provisions of the act in an amendment to an appropriation bill for the Department Of Homeland Security. The bill became law in September 2006, with the amendment modified to allow for the temporary surrender of a firearm as a condition for entering a rescue or evacuation vehicle.

On April 17, 2013, Vitter voted against the Toomey-Manchin Gun Control Amendment. The amendment failed to reach the sixty senatorial votes necessary to overcome a Republican-led filibuster. The Toomey-Manchin Gun Control Amendment is a bipartisan deal on gun background checks. Under the proposal, federal background checks would be expanded to include gun shows and online sales. All such sales would be channeled through licensed firearm dealers who would be charged for keeping record of transactions. The proposal does not require background checks for private sales between individuals.

In February 2008, Vitter – along with Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo of Idaho – blocked the confirmation of Michael J. Sullivan as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) saying Sullivan supports &quot;burdensome regulations&quot; on gun owners and dealers and is &quot;overly aggressive&quot; enforcing gun laws. An editorial writer for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that Vitter&#x27;s position was &quot;unreasonable&quot; because the guns Sullivan sought to control are those commonly used in crimes: those stolen or purchased on the black market. On the other hand, gun rights advocates say that many gun dealers have lost their licenses for harmless bureaucratic errors. Sullivan stayed on as acting head of the ATF until January 2009 to make way for President Barack Obama to name his own nominee.

====Hurricane Katrina====

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Vitter and the rest of the Louisiana congressional delegation worked to bring aid to the Gulf Coast region to rebuild broken levees, schools and hospitals, restore coastal wetlands, and provide assistance for its many victims.

In early September, Vitter said that he would give &quot;the entire big government organized relief effort a failing grade, across the board.&quot; He said that state and local governments shared in the blame as well. Vitter&#x27;s actions during Hurricane Katrina are described in historian Douglas Brinkley&#x27;s May 2006 book, &quot;The Great Deluge&quot;.

In September 2007, Vitter announced that he got &quot;a critical concession&quot; from the White House that decreased Louisiana&#x27;s obligations for hurricane recovery by $1 billion. However, the White House said that was false.

====Immigration====
Vitter has been actively involved with legislation concerning illegal immigrants. In June 2007, he led a group of conservative Senators in blocking the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, a piece of federal legislation that would have granted a pathway to legal residence to 12 million illegal immigrants coupled with increased border enforcement. The bill&#x27;s defeat won Vitter national attention as the bill was supported by President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Ted Kennedy, among others. Vitter characterized the bill as amnesty, which supporters denied. Bush accused the bill&#x27;s opponents of fear mongering.

In October 2007, Vitter introduced an amendment withholding Community Oriented Policing Services funds from any sanctuary city which bans city employees and police officers from asking people about their immigration status in violation of the Illegal Immigration Act. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, in opposition to the amendment, said these cities do not want to inquire about someone&#x27;s status if they report a crime, are a victim of domestic violence or get vaccinations for their children. The amendment was defeated.

In November 2007, Vitter introduced a bill requiring banks to verify that no customer was an illegal immigrant before issuing banking or credit cards. The bill never made it out of committee.

In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced the latter two proposals and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills in a Republican package of tough immigration enforcement measures including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies); additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007.

In April 2008, Vitter introduced a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that a child born in the United States is not a citizen unless a parent is a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien serving in the military. Currently the Constitution grants citizenship to children born within the U.S. regardless of the legal status of the parents. The bill never made it out of the Democratic-led committee.

==== Louisiana Family Forum earmark ====

In September 2007, Vitter earmarked $100,000 in federal money for a Christian group, the Louisiana Family Forum, known for challenging evolution by means of &quot;teaching the controversy&quot; which promotes intelligent design. According to Vitter, the earmark was &quot;to develop a plan to promote better science education&quot;. &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; alleged the group had close ties with Vitter. However, they have criticized Vitter for his support of Rudy Giuliani.

On October 17, 2007, the liberal organization People For the American Way, along with several other groups asked the Senate to remove the earmark. Vitter later withdrew it.

====Military====
In May 2008, Vitter voted with the majority, despite the opposition of Bush and other Republicans, for the passage of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 to expand educational benefits for veterans similar to the level provided for returning World War II veterans in the G.I. Bill.

====Network neutrality====
Vitter was one of six senate Republicans to propose an amendment to a bill which would stop the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from enforcing network neutrality which they allege is a violation of the First Amendment.

==== New Orleans public housing ====
In September 2007, &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; reported that Vitter and the Bush administration opposed a provision of The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery bill which required that every public housing apartment torn down be replaced with another form of low-income housing on a one-for-one basis. The administration testified that there was not sufficient demand for public housing units, a position contested by several senators. Vitter stated it would recreate &quot;housing projects exactly as they were&quot;, isolated and riddled with crime. However, Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democratic Senator, said the intent was to make certain there were affordable places for working-class people who returned. The bill requires that demolished housing projects be replaced with mixed income communities which local housing advocates say is different from the massive public housing developments that Vitter is referring to. However, the bill does not include a ban on large-scale projects. The city housing authority is planning on replacing 4,000 low-income units with mixed-income projects providing a smaller inventory of low-income units. In December 2007, Vitter prevented the bill from leaving the committee.

====Obama nominations====
Vitter and Jim DeMint were the only two Senators that voted against Hillary Clinton&#x27;s confirmation for the position of Secretary of State under the new Obama administration, on January 21, 2009.

He blocked President Obama&#x27;s nominee for the new Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator until he received a written commitment on flood control issues from the nominee and FEMA. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, along with some Republican Senators, criticized Vitter for what it characterized as political posturing, given that the hurricane season was quickly approaching. He lifted his hold on May 12, 2009.

====Affordable Care Act====
Vitter opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

====Same-sex marriage====
Vitter opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions. In June 2006, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any issue that&#x27;s more important than this one ... I think this debate is very healthy, and it&#x27;s winning a lot of hearts and minds. I think we&#x27;re going to show real progress.&quot; In 2006, he told &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a conservative who opposes radically redefining marriage, the most important social institution in human history.&quot;

In October 2005, at a Lafayette Parish Republican Executive Committee luncheon, Vitter compared gay marriage to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which came through the same geographical areas. Vitter said &quot;It&#x27;s the crossroads where Katrina meets Rita. I always knew I was against same-sex unions.&quot;

====School board prayer====
In 2005 Vitter introduced a resolution supporting prayer at school board meetings in response to an earlier district court decision that the Louisiana&#x27;s Tangipahoa Parish practice of opening meetings with Christian prayers was unconstitutional. The bill died in committee after receiving little support from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Vitter later reintroduced the resolution in January 2007 after a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court concluded that Christian prayers were unconstitutional but was undecided whether nonsectarian prayers were allowed. In July 2007, the full Fifth Circuit dismissed the case because of a lack of standing. The school board subsequently resumed prayer evocations but opened it to diverse community religions. Vitter&#x27;s bill died in committee.

====Tea Party movement====
In recognition of the Tea Party protests opposing President Barack Obama&#x27;s policies, Vitter proposed Senate Resolution 98, which would designate April 15 in years both 2009 and 2010 as &quot;National TEA Party Day&quot;. As of April 2009, the bill has no cosponsors and has been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary with no scheduled action.

In September 2010, Vitter signed a candidate pledge from the North Central Louisiana TEA Party Patriots. It included a promise to &quot;Conduct myself personally and professionally in a moral and socially appropriate manner.&quot;

====United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea====
In September 2007, during hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vitter expressed serious doubts about the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty concerning issues of U.S. sovereignty echoing an array of conservative groups against the treaty including the National Center for Public Policy Research, The Heritage Foundation and the Center for Security Policy. The treaty, which sets up countries&#x27; jurisdiction over their coasts and ocean including exploration and navigation rights, was supported by the Bush administration, a majority of the United States Senate, the Pentagon, the State Department and Navy as do a coalition of business and environmental groups. The committee approved the treaty 17–4, with Vitter voting no.

==== Water Resources and Development Act ====
Vitter helped write the Water Resources and Development Act for flood-control, hurricane-protection and coastal-restoration projects including $3.6 billion for Louisiana. He called it the &quot;single most important&quot; legislation for assisting Louisiana with its recovery from hurricane Katrina. President George W. Bush vetoed the act, objecting to its cost. Congress overrode his veto, enacting the bill.

==2007 prostitution scandal==
In early July 2007, Vitter&#x27;s phone number was included in a published list of phone records of Pamela Martin and Associates, a company owned and run by Deborah Jeane Palfrey, also known as the &quot;D.C. Madam&quot;, who was convicted by the U.S. government for running a prostitution service. &quot;Hustler&quot; identified the phone number and contacted Vitter&#x27;s office to ask about his connection to Palfrey. The following day, Vitter issued a written statement in which he took responsibility for his &quot;sin&quot; and asked for forgiveness. On July 16, 2007, after a week of self-imposed seclusion, Vitter emerged and called a news conference. As his wife stood next to him, Vitter asked the public for forgiveness. Following Vitter&#x27;s remarks, his wife Wendy Vitter spoke, but both refused to answer any questions. In 2004, Vitter had denied allegations that he had patronized prostitutes.

While the Louisiana state Republican Party offered guarded support, national Republicans offered forgiveness. &quot;The Nation&quot; predicted that the Republican Party would be in a &quot;forgiving mood&quot;, because if he were to resign, Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco, a Democrat, would likely appoint a Democrat to take Vitter&#x27;s place until a special election could be held, thus increasing Democratic control over the US Senate.

On September 8, 2015, reporter Derek Myers was fired from WVLA-TV after asking Vitter, who was running for governor, about allegations that the senator had frequented prostitutes. After Myers&#x27;s question, Myers said an unnamed coworker overheard a conversation about the Vitter campaign&#x27;s ad spending at the station, possibly with a threat from the campaign to pull the ads. Democrat John Bel Edwards released an ad about the prostitution scandal two weeks before the run-off election and won by more than 12%.

==2015 gubernatorial election==

Vitter announced on January 21, 2014, that he would run for governor of Louisiana in the 2015 election. Then-Governor Bobby Jindal was ineligible to seek re-election due to term limits. Vitter was the first sitting or ex-U.S. Senator to launch a gubernatorial bid in Louisiana since 1904, when Democrat Newton Blanchard was elected. Vitter&#x27;s major opponents were Republicans Scott Angelle, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner and former lieutenant governor, and Jay Dardenne, the current lieutenant governor; and Democrat John Bel Edwards, Minority Leader of the Louisiana House of Representatives.

In the November 21 runoff election, Edwards defeated Vitter by 56% to 44%.

==Other political involvement==
In 2016, Vitter succeeded after a five-year battle in passing through the Senate landmark legislation to reform the country&#x27;s chemical safety laws. Vitter called the legislation a &quot;big accomplishment. This is an area of federal law that everybody, every stakeholder, every group, whether it&#x27;s some far-left environmental group or industry, said needed to be updated. The trick was getting agreement on doing that.&quot; Democratic colleague Richard Durbin of Illinois, a frequent critic of Vitter, said that if the bill is enacted with President Obama&#x27;s signature &quot;it&#x27;s quite an accomplishment for him and for Congress to pass historic legislation.&quot;

==Post-Senate career==
After his Senate term ended, Vitter joined the Washington, D.C. lobbying firm Mercury LLC. As of October 2019, Vitter had lobbied for sanctioned Chinese surveillance company Hikvision as well as for the Libyan Government of National Accord and the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. He also lobbied for the sanctioned Russian bank Sovcombank.

<text>The , also known as the Upheaval of Ōnin and Ōnin-Bunmei war, was a civil war that lasted from 1467 to 1477, during the Muromachi period in Japan. &quot;Ōnin&quot; refers to the Japanese era during which the war started; the war ended during the Bunmei era. A dispute between a high official, Hosokawa Katsumoto, and a regional lord, Yamana Sōzen, escalated into a nationwide civil war involving the Ashikaga shogunate and a number of in many regions of Japan.

The war initiated the Sengoku period, &quot;the Warring States period.&quot; This period was a long, drawn-out struggle for domination by individual &quot;daimyō&quot;, resulting in a mass power-struggle between the various houses to dominate the whole of Japan.

==Origin==
The &quot;Ōnin&quot; conflict began as a controversy over who would succeed &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimasa. In 1464, Yoshimasa had no heir. He persuaded his younger brother, Ashikaga Yoshimi, to abandon the life of a monk, and named him heir. In 1465, the unanticipated birth of a son to Yoshimasa put these plans in question. The infant, Yoshihisa, led to a succession crisis with two competing factions. On one side was the &quot;shōgun&quot; and his brother, together with the &quot;shōgun&#x27;s&quot; deputy, Hosokawa. On the other side was Yoshihisa&#x27;s mother, Hino Tomiko, and her ally Yamana, who was the governor of several provinces.

Tomiko sought political and military support to rule as regent until the maturity of her son, the future shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa. She secured the support of Yamana Sōzen and other leaders of powerful samurai clans. In contrast to Tomiko and Yamana, Yoshimi had the support of the Hosokawa clan, a powerful clan that had a great influence on the shogunate court. 

The cause of the war is often attributed to the struggle to succeed the 8th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, but in fact there were multiple causes. The real power of the Ashikaga shogunate was vested in a council of powerful daimyo, but the deaths of a number of influential daimyo and the intervention in politics of women close to the shogun&#x27;s entourage led to chaos in the shogunate, and from 1441 on, the masses demanded a virtue decree every few years and destroyed the sake stores and warehouses that were the source of the shogunate&#x27;s funding. Under these circumstances, in addition to the conflicts over the succession of the shogun, conflicts over the succession of the Hatakeyama clan and conflicts over the succession of the Shiba clan occurred simultaneously, all of which contributed to the war. According to the most popular theory, the main cause of the war was the struggle for succession between Hatakeyama Yoshinari and Hatakeyama Masanaga within the Hatakeyama clan, with the participation of Hosokawa Katsumoto, Yamana Sōzen and other daimyo from various regions.

In 1467, these conflicts finally led to the Ōnin War between the Eastern Army, led by Hosokawa Katsumoto and including Hatakeyama Masanaga, Shiba Yoshitoshi, and Ashikaga Yoshimi, and the Western Army, led by Yamana Sōzen and including Hatakeyama Yoshinari, Shiba Yoshikado, and Ashikaga Yoshihisa.

At first, the Eastern Army supported Ashikaga Yoshimi and the Western Army supported Ashikaga Yoshihisa as the next 9th shogun. However, Ashikaga Yoshimi, who disliked war, fled to Ise to seek refuge with the Kitabatake clan, and Ashikaga Yoshimi fell out with Ashikaga Yoshimasa, the 8th shogun. When the Western Army received Ashikaga Yoshimi in 1468, the Eastern Army came to support Ashikaga Yoshihisa. In other words, the successors supported by the Eastern and Western armies reversed within a year.

==Battles==


Hosokawa&#x27;s Eastern Army of about 85,000 and Yamana&#x27;s Western Army of about 80,000 were almost evenly matched when mobilized near Kyoto. The fighting started in March when a Hosokawa mansion was burned. Then in May 1467, a Yamana mansion was attacked. In July, according to Sansom, Yoshimasa appointed Hosokawa commanding general in an attempt to &quot;chastise the rebel&quot; Yamana. Sansom states &quot;heavy fighting continued throughout July&quot; and &quot;several hundred large buildings were destroyed, and destruction continued day after day&quot;. Hosokawa was soon cornered in the northeast portion of Kyoto around his mansion, while Yamana controlled the south and west. Yamana received 20,000 reinforcements under Ōuchi Masahiro in September. However, Sansom states Hosokawa was able to bring the &quot;sovereign and the abdicated Emperor&quot; to the Bakufu from the Emperor&#x27;s Palace, before it was seized by Yamana with 50,000 men. Hosokawa then received Akamatsu troops as reinforcements. On 1 November, Yamana was able to capture the Shōkoku-ji after bribing a monk. Sansom states &quot;The chronicles of the time paint a dreadful picture of the carnage&quot;, and &quot;the two adversaries faced one another without action for the rest of the year&quot;.

Hosokawa attempted an attack on New Years Day, and then again in April, but for the most part &quot;the two armies now remained glaring at one another month after month&quot;. A central trench ten feet deep and twenty feet wide separated the two armies. Several monasteries were burned, including the Tenryū-ji. Finally, Yoshimi went to the side of Yamana, forcing the &quot;shōgun&quot; to name his son Yoshihisa as his heir in 1469. In a strange switch of allegiances, the war became one of brother against brother. The Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado stripped &quot;Yoshimi of his court ranks&quot; and declared him a rebel.

Both Yamana Sōzen and Hosokawa Katsumoto died in 1473, and even then the war continued on, with neither side able to figure out how to end it. However, eventually the Yamana clan lost heart as the label of &quot;rebel&quot; was at last having some effect. Ōuchi Masahiro, one of the Yamana generals, eventually burnt down his section of Kyoto and left the area on 17 December 1477.

By 1477, ten years after the fighting had begun, Kyoto was nothing more than a place for mobs to loot and move in to take what was left. Neither the Yamana clan nor the Hosokawa clan had achieved its aims, other than to whittle down the numbers of the opposing clan.

During this ordeal, the &quot;shōgun&quot; was not instrumental in alleviating the situation. While Kyoto was burning, Ashikaga Yoshimasa spent his time in poetry readings and other cultural activities, and in planning Ginkaku-ji, a Silver Pavilion to rival Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion that his grandfather, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, had built.

The Ōnin War, and the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s complacent attitude towards it, &quot;sanctioned&quot; private wars and skirmishes between the other &quot;daimyō&quot;. No part of Japan escaped the violence. Although the battles in Kyoto had been abandoned, the war had spread to the rest of Japan. In Yamashiro Province, the Hatakeyama clan had split into two parts that fought each other to a standstill. This stalemate was to have serious consequences. In 1485, the peasantry and jizamurai (lesser samurai – mostly armed peasants) had had enough, and revolted. They organized the Yamashiro ikki and forced the clan armies to leave the province. The ikki became a powerful force, much more than simply an armed mob. By 1486 they had even set up a provisional government for Yamashiro province.

Other ikki would form and appear throughout other parts of Japan, such as Kaga Province, where a sect of the Jōdo Shinshū Buddhists, the Ikkō, started their own revolt during the Ōnin War after being enlisted by one of Kaga&#x27;s most prominent warlords, Togashi Masachika. The Ikkō, who had a complex relationship with the Jōdo Shinshō leader Rennyo, appealed to the common peasants in their region, and inevitably formed the Ikkō-ikki. By 1488 the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga Province overthrew Masachika and took control of the province. After this they began building a fortified castle-cathedral along the Yodo River and used it as their headquarters.

The uprising of the Ikkō-ikki and the Yamashiro-ikki formed part of the general outbreak of civil war. Sansom states some refer to this as &quot;gekokujō&quot; (roughly &quot;the low oppress the high&quot;), or a &quot;disturbed social order&quot;. Sansom further states, &quot;The frequent risings of the fifteenth century were expressions of popular discontent in which peasants took part&quot;.

==Aftermath==
After the Ōnin War, the Ashikaga &quot;bakufu&quot; completely fell apart; for all practical purposes, the Hosokawa family was in charge and the Ashikaga &quot;shōguns&quot; became their puppets. When Yoshimi&#x27;s son Yoshitane was made &quot;shōgun&quot; in 1490, the Hosokawa Kanrei (deputy) soon put him to flight in 1493 and declared another Ashikaga, Yoshizumi, to be &quot;shōgun&quot;. In 1499, Yoshitane arrived at Yamaguchi, the capital of the Ōuchi, and this powerful family threw its military support behind Yoshitane.

In 1507, the Kanrei Hosokawa Masamoto was assassinated and in 1508, Yoshizumi left Kyoto and the Ōuchi restored the shogunate to Yoshitane. Thence began a series of strange conflicts over control of the puppet government of the shogunate. After the death of Hosokawa Masamoto, his adopted sons Takakuni and Sumimoto began to fight over the succession to the Kanrei, but Sumimoto himself was a puppet of one of his vassals. This would characterize the wars following the Ōnin War; these wars were more about control over puppet governments than they were about high ideals or simply greed for territory.

The Hosokawa family controlled the shogunate until 1558 when they were betrayed by a vassal family, the Miyoshi. The powerful Ōuchi were also destroyed by a vassal, Mōri Motonari, in 1551.

By the end of the Warring States period only a dozen or so warlord families remained. The most important development to come out of the Ōnin War was the ceaseless civil war that ignited outside the capital city. Hosokawa tried to foment civil strife in the Ōuchi domains, for instance, and this civil strife would eventually force Ōuchi to submit and leave. From the close of the Ōnin War, this type of civil strife, either vassals striving to conquer their &quot;daimyō&quot; or succession disputes drawing in outside &quot;daimyō&quot;, was endemic all throughout Japan.

Scholars disagree on the appropriateness of the term &quot;Warring States period&quot; (which is the Chinese term borrowed by the Japanese in calling this period &quot;sengoku jidai&quot;). Many argue that since Japan was essentially intact, the Emperor and shogunate remaining at least nominally in command of the whole country, and that it really wasn&#x27;t a &quot;warring states&quot; period at all, but a &quot;warring warlords&quot; period. Others such as Mark Ravina, Mary Elizabeth Berry, and Conrad Totman argue that the &quot;kuni&quot; (provinces) were not unlike quasi-independent states, and that the term is thus more or less appropriate.

The cost for the individual &quot;daimyō&quot; was tremendous, and a century of conflict so weakened the bulk of Japanese warlords that the three great figures of Japanese unification, beginning with Oda Nobunaga, found it easier to militarily assert a single, unified military government.

===Kyoto===
Kyoto was devastated by the war, not really recovering until the mid-16th century. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since, being spared the strategic bombing of Japanese cities during World War II. In Kyoto, &quot;pre-war&quot; refers to the Ōnin War, rather than World War II.

==&quot;Ōnin Ki&quot;==
The &quot;Ōnin Ki&quot; (応仁記) is a document written sometime from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 16th century (i.e. some 20 to 80 years after the conflict), which describes the causes and effects of the &quot;Ōnin&quot; War. It illustrates in detail the strategies involved in the fighting, and its chief instigators, Yamana Sōzen and Hosokawa Katsumoto, along with accounts of how the Onin War affected the city and its citizens:
&quot;The flowery capitol which we thought would last forever to our surprise is to become a lair of wolves and foxes. Even the North Field of Toji has fallen to ash ... Lamenting the plight of the many fallen acolytes, Ii-o Hikorokusaemon-No-Jou read a passage:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;ja-Latn&quot;&gt;&quot;Nare ya shiru&quot;
&quot;Miyako wa nobe no&quot;
&quot;Yū-hibari&quot;
&quot;Agaru wo mite mo&quot;
&quot;Ochiru na-mida wa&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Now the city that you knew
Has become an empty moor,
From which the evening skylark rises
While your tears fall.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
==Chronology==
The origins of the &quot;Ōnin&quot; conflict are manifold. To say that the war began with a quarrel between angry warlords is too simplistic. The initial phase of this decade-long struggle &quot;was only a spark which set fire to a broader conflagration&quot;. Without fully anticipating the consequences, the Muromachi government had loosened the restraints of tradition in Japanese society, which meant that &quot;new energies were released, new classes were formed, and new wealth was created&quot;. As the shogunate&#x27;s powerful figures competed for influence in Kyoto, the leading families in the provinces were amassing resources and growing more independent of centralized controls.

<text>Sir Alan James Carter Duncan (born 31 March 1957) is a British former politician who served as Minister of State for International Development from 2010 to 2014 and Minister of State for Europe and the Americas from 2016 to 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rutland and Melton from 1992 to 2019.

He began his career in the oil industry with Royal Dutch Shell, and was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1992 general election. After gaining several minor positions in the government of John Major, he played a key role in William Hague&#x27;s successful bid for the Conservative leadership in 1997. Duncan received several promotions to the Conservative front bench, and eventually joined the Shadow Cabinet after the 2005 general election. He stood for the Conservative leadership in 2005, but withdrew early on because of a lack of support. Eventual winner David Cameron appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in December 2005; the name of the department he shadowed was changed to Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform in July 2007.

Following the 2010 general election, the new Conservative Prime Minister Cameron appointed Duncan as Minister of State for International Development. He left this post following the government reshuffle in July 2014, and was subsequently appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in September 2014, for services to international development and to UK–Middle East relations. While on the backbenches, Duncan served on the Intelligence and Security Committee between 2015 and 2016.

After two years out of government, he returned to frontline politics when new Prime Minister Theresa May appointed him as Minister for Europe and the Americas, and effective deputy to then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in July 2016. Duncan resigned as Minister of State on 22 July 2019 citing Johnson&#x27;s election to the Tory leadership and, hence, the UK&#x27;s premiership.

He became the first openly gay Conservative Member of Parliament, publicly coming out in 2002.

==Early life==
Duncan was born in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, the second son of James Grant Duncan, an RAF wing commander, and his wife Anne Duncan (née Carter), a teacher. The family travelled much, following Duncan&#x27;s father on NATO postings, including in Gibraltar, Italy, and Norway.

==Education==
Duncan was educated at two independent schools: Beechwood Park School in Markyate, and Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in Northwood, at both of which he was &#x27;Head Monitor&#x27; (head boy). He had two brothers, who also attended Beechwood Park School. Their family supported the Liberal Party, and Duncan ran (and lost) as a Liberal at a school mock election in 1970; two years later he joined the Young Conservatives.

He then attended St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he coxed the college&#x27;s first eight, and was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1979. Whilst there, he formed a friendship with Benazir Bhutto, and ran her successful campaign to become the President of the Oxford Union. He gained a Kennedy Scholarship to study at Harvard University between 1981 and 1982.

==Business career==
After graduating from Oxford, Duncan worked as a trader of oil and refined products, first with Royal Dutch Shell (1979–81) and then for Marc Rich from 1982 to 1988 (Rich became a fugitive from justice in 1983). He worked for Rich in London and Singapore. Duncan used the connections he had built up to be self-employed from 1988 to 1992, acting as a consultant and adviser to foreign governments on oil supplies, shipping and refining.

In 1989, Duncan set up the independent Harcourt Consultants, which advises on oil and gas matters. He made over £1 million after helping fill the need to supply oil to Pakistan after supplies from Kuwait had been disrupted in the Gulf War.

==Political career==
Duncan was an active member of the Battersea Conservative Association from 1979 until 1984, when he moved to live in Singapore, from which he returned in 1986. After Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher resigned in November 1990, he offered his home in Westminster as the headquarters of John Major&#x27;s leadership campaign.

===Member of Parliament===
Duncan first stood for Parliament as a Conservative candidate in the 1987 general election, unsuccessfully contesting the safe Labour seat of Barnsley West and Penistone. For the 1992 general election he was selected as the Conservative candidate for Rutland and Melton, a safe Conservative seat, which he retained with a 59% share of the votes cast. In the Labour landslide of 1997, his proportion of the vote was reduced to 46% but increased at subsequent elections to a high of 62.8% in 2017.

From 1993 to 1995, Duncan was a member of the Social Security Select Committee. His first governmental position was as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Health, a position he obtained in December 1993. He resigned from the position within a month, after it emerged that he had used the Right to Buy programme to make profits on property deals. It emerged that he had lent his elderly next-door neighbour money to buy his home under the Right to Buy legislation. The neighbour bought an 18th-century council house at a significant discount and sold it to Duncan just over three years later. Gyles Brandreth describes this event in his diary: &quot;little Alan Duncan has fallen on his sword. He did it swiftly and with good grace.&quot;

After returning to the backbenches, he became Chairman of the Conservative Backbench Constitutional Affairs Committee. He returned to government in July 1995, when he was again appointed a Parliamentary Private Secretary, this time to the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Brian Mawhinney. In November 1995, Duncan performed a citizen&#x27;s arrest on an Asylum Bill protester who threw paint and flour at Mawhinney on College Green.

Duncan was involved in the 1997 leadership contest, being the right-hand man of William Hague, the eventual winner. In this capacity, he was called &quot;the closest thing [the Conservatives] have to Peter Mandelson&quot;. Duncan and Hague had both been at Oxford, both been Presidents of the Oxford Union, and had been close friends since at least the early 1980s.

===Front-bench career===
As a reward for his loyalty to Hague during the leadership contest, in June 1997, Duncan was entrusted with the positions of Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party and Parliamentary Political Secretary to the Party Leader. He became Shadow Health Minister in June 1998. A year later he was made Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman, and he was appointed a front-bench spokesman on Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in September 2001.

When Michael Howard became Conservative Party leader in November 2003, Duncan became Shadow Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, but as Howard had significantly reduced the size of the Shadow Cabinet, Duncan was not promoted to the top table. This continued to be the case when he was moved to become Shadow Secretary of State for International Development in September 2004. However, following the 2005 general election, the Shadow Cabinet was expanded to its original size once more, and Duncan joined it as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport.

He held this position for just seven months, becoming Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 7 December 2005, after David Cameron&#x27;s election to the party leadership the previous day. On 2 July 2007, he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, as new prime minister Gordon Brown had abolished the Department of Trade and Industry the previous week, replacing it with the aforementioned new department. In January 2009, Duncan became Shadow Leader of the House of Commons.

===Failed leadership bid===
Before the 2005 general election, he was rumoured to be planning a leadership campaign in the event that then-leader Michael Howard stepped down after a (then-likely and later actual) election defeat. On 10 June 2005, Duncan publicly declared his intention of standing in the 2005 leadership election. However, on 18 July 2005, he withdrew from the race, admitting in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that his withdrawal was due to a lack of &#x27;active lieutenants&#x27;, and urged the party to abandon those that he dubbed the &#x27;Tory Taliban&#x27;:
===MPs&#x27; expenses 2009===

On 15 May 2009, the satirical BBC programme &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; showed footage of Duncan&#x27;s previous appearance on the show in which he boasted about his second home allowance, denied that he should pay any of the money back and stated it was &quot;a great system&quot;. The show then cut to footage of David Cameron announcing that Duncan would return money to the fees office, followed by Duncan&#x27;s personal apology, in which he called for the system to be changed.

On 14 August, Duncan said (whilst being filmed without his knowledge by &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot;), that MPs, who were at the time paid around £64,000 a year, were having &quot;to live on rations and are treated like shit. I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fraction on what is proper. And I could claim the whole lot, but I don&#x27;t.&quot; These remarks attracted the attention of the press, and were criticised by commentators from all sides. Duncan apologised once more, and Cameron, though critical of Duncan&#x27;s comments, denied that he would sack him from the Shadow Cabinet. Despite these assurances, on 7 September 2009, Duncan was &quot;demoted&quot; from the Shadow Cabinet, to become Shadow Minister for Prisons, after he and Cameron came to an agreement that his position was untenable.

===Political funding===
The Rutland and Melton Constituency Association has received £12,166.66 in donations since 2006. Duncan has received corporate donations from The Biz Club (£6,000, 2006–09), Midland Software Holdings (£8,000, 2007–09), and ABM Holdings (£1,500, 2009). Duncan has also had tens of thousands of pounds from private individual donors.

===WikiLeaks 2010===
According to a US diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks and reported on by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, US Intelligence drew up a dossier on several members of the Conservative party, including Duncan, in order to assess the possible policies of a future Conservative government. US intelligence compiled details of Duncan&#x27;s political associations with leading Conservatives, including William Hague. The cable called for further intelligence of &quot;Duncan&#x27;s relationship with Conservative party leader David Cameron and William Hague&quot;, and asked: &quot;What role would Duncan play if the Conservatives form a government? What are Duncan&#x27;s political ambitions?&quot;

===Nuclear power===
As shadow business secretary in 2008, Duncan stated, referring to the Hinkley Point C project, that &quot;on no account should there be any kind of subsidy for nuclear power.&quot;

===Middle East===
In August 2011, Duncan found himself under pressure to remove a video of himself accusing Israel of a &quot;land grab&quot; in the occupied territories. In an October 2014 speech to the Royal United Services Institute, Duncan said: &quot;Indeed just as we rightly judge someone as unfit for public office if they refuse to recognise Israel, so we should shun anyone who refuses to recognise settlements are illegal. No settlement endorsers should be regarded as fit to stand for public office, remain a member of a mainstream political party or sit in a parliament. How can we accept lawmakers in our country or any other country when they support lawbreakers in another?&quot; In a BBC Radio interview linked to that speech and another given during a House of Commons debate on Palestinian statehood he said: &quot;All know that the United States is in hock to a very powerful financial lobby which dominates its politics.&quot; Commenting on Duncan&#x27;s statements, a spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews called him &quot;breathtakingly one-sided&quot;.
===Libyan oil cell===
In August 2011, it was reported that Duncan had played an instrumental role in blocking fuel supplies to Tripoli, Libya, during the Libyan conflict. In April 2011, the former oil trader convinced the UK prime minister to establish the so-called &#x27;Libyan oil cell&#x27;, which was run out of the Foreign Office.

The cell advised NATO to blockade the port of Zawiya to stifle Gaddafi&#x27;s war effort. They also helped identify other passages the smugglers were using to get fuel into Libya via Tunisia and Algeria.

London-based oil traders were encouraged to sell fuel to rebels in Benghazi, with communication being established between traders and the rebels to route the fuel.

One Whitehall source commented: &#x27;The energy noose tightened around Tripoli&#x27;s neck. It was much more effective and easier to repair than bombs. It is like taking the key of the car away. You can&#x27;t move. The great thing is you can switch it all back on again if Gaddafi goes. It is not the same as if you have bombed the whole city to bits.

===Appointment to Privy Council===
On 28 May 2010, he was appointed to the Privy Council, upon the formation of the Coalition government. He was sworn into the Privy Council on 9 June 2010 at Buckingham Palace. This entitled him to the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

===Comments by Israeli embassy official===

In January 2017, Al Jazeera aired a series entitled &quot;The Lobby&quot;. The last episode showed Shai Masot, the political officer at the Israeli embassy in London, proposing an attempt to &quot;take down&quot; British &quot;pro-Palestinian&quot; politicians, including Duncan. The leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn wrote an open letter to Theresa May objecting to what he called an &quot;improper interference in this country&#x27;s democratic process&quot; and urging the prime minister to launch an inquiry on the basis that &quot;[t]his is clearly a national security issue&quot;. The Israeli ambassador Mark Regev apologised to Duncan for the &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; comments made in the video. A Foreign Office spokesman, effectively rejecting Corbyn&#x27;s comments, said it &quot;is clear these comments do not reflect the views of the embassy or government of Israel&quot;. Masot resigned shortly after the recordings were made public. Pro-Israel British activists and a former Israel embassy employee complained to Ofcom about &quot;The Lobby&quot;, but Ofcom dismissed all charges.

==Political views==

Duncan was described by the BBC in 2002 as a right-wing libertarian. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has described him in &#x27;economically libertarian&#x27; (2008) and &#x27;socially libertarian&#x27; (2004). The LGBT journal &quot;PinkNews&quot; called him in 2005 the &#x27;liberal, urbane face of the Conservative Party&#x27;, naming him as one of the then &#x27;50 most powerful LGBT people in British politics&#x27;. He was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2008 as a &quot;moderniser&quot;.

One of the chapters in his book &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot; is devoted to an explanation of his support for the legalisation of all drugs. This chapter was removed when the paperback edition was published to prevent embarrassment to the party leadership; however, Duncan had, at one time, posted the chapter on his website, &quot;for the benefit of the enquiring student&quot;. Duncan believes in minimising the size of government, and in &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot; advocated limiting government responsibility to essential services such as defence, policing and health.

In 2002, Duncan was described by the BBC as a &quot;staunch&quot; Eurosceptic. However, he declared for the &#x27;Remain&#x27; camp in the run-up to the UK&#x27;s referendum on EU membership. On 2 October 2017, Duncan spoke at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. In his speech he attributed Britain&#x27;s majority vote to leave the EU to a &quot;blue-collar tantrum against immigration&quot;.

He is on the council of the Conservative Way Forward (CWF) group. He is one of the leading British members of Le Cercle, a secretive foreign policy discussion forum. In contrast to most members of both CWF and Le Cercle, who hold pro-Republican Atlanticist views, he actively supported John Kerry in the US 2004 presidential election. This surprised some, but Duncan is a friend of Kerry, having met him while at Harvard.

Following the release of the Panama Papers, which contained revelations about David Cameron&#x27;s income from overseas funds set up by his father, Duncan defended the Prime Minister. He urged Cameron&#x27;s critics, especially MPs, to &quot;admit that their real point is that they hate anyone who has got a hint of wealth in them&quot; from whose viewpoint it followed that &quot;we risk seeing a House of Commons which is stuffed full of low-achievers&quot;. Michael Deacon wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;There are two inferences to draw from Sir Alan&#x27;s outburst. One is that he thinks the Commons should only be &#x27;stuffed with&#x27; the rich. The second is that he thinks the vast majority of his constituents, not being rich, are &#x27;low-achievers&#x27;. Probably not a view to advertise in his next election leaflet&quot;.

During the Israel-Hamas war, Duncan criticised Conservative Friends of Israel. Speaking on LBC in April 2024, he said that they had &quot;been doing the bidding of Netanyahu, bypassing all proper processes of government to exercise undue influence at the top of government.&quot; Duncan added, &quot;What you have is a lot of people now sitting around Rishi Sunak who are giving him appalling advice. Let&#x27;s start with the head of CFI, who has been for many years Lord Polak. In my view, I think he should be removed from the Lords because he is exercising the interests of another country, not that of the parliament in which he sits, joined, I have to say, by Lord Pickles. They&#x27;re the sort of the Laurel and Hardy who should be pushed out together.&quot; Polak, CFI&#x27;s honorary president, is Jewish, while Pickles, the group&#x27;s parliamentary chair, is not Jewish. The Jewish Leadership Council accused Duncan of sharing &quot;antisemitic tropes&quot;, and the Board of Deputies of British Jews labelled his comments &quot;disgraceful&quot;. The Conservative Party consequently began investigating him. On 16 July 2024, he was cleared of wrongdoing following an internal investigation. The Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) investigation, which Duncan termed a &quot;McCarthyite witch-hunt&quot;, found his comments were within political debate and not anti-semitic.

==Personal life==
Duncan was the first sitting Conservative MP voluntarily to acknowledge that he is gay; he did this in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; on 29 July 2002, although he has said that this came as no surprise to friends. Indeed, in an editorial published on the news of Duncan&#x27;s coming out, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported, &quot;The news that Alan Duncan is gay will come as a surprise only to those who have never met him. The bantam Tory frontbencher can hardly be accused of having hidden his homosexuality.&quot;

On 3 March 2008, it was announced in the Court &amp; Social page of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Duncan would be entering into a civil partnership with his partner James Dunseath, which would make him the first member of either the Cabinet or the Shadow Cabinet to enter into a civil partnership. The two were joined as civil partners on 24 July 2008 at Merchant Taylors&#x27; Hall in the City of London.

Duncan had a following in the gay community and was active in speaking up for gay rights. He was responsible for formulating the Conservatives&#x27; policy response to the introduction of civil partnership legislation in 2004, which he considered his proudest achievement of the Parliament between 2001 and 2005. He was among those who rebelled against his party by voting for an equal age of consent between heterosexuals and homosexuals on numerous occasions between 1998 and 2000. He voted against same-sex adoption in 2001.

==Works and appearances==

===Books===
Duncan is the author of three published nonfiction books:
* (economics)
* (political science)
* (political memoir of 2016–2020)

His pamphlet &quot;An End to Illusions&quot; proposed an independent Bank of England, the break-up of clearing banks, reduction of implicit tax subsidies given to owner-occupiers, curtailment of pension fund tax privileges, and new forms of corporate ownership.

&quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot; presents a detailed case regarding the history and consequences of government control over institutions and activities which were historically private, to the extent that many citizens assume that privately or communally developed municipal facilities and universities are creations of the state, and that prohibitions on drug use, sex, and personal defence have always existed.

&quot;In the Thick of It&quot; is Duncan&#x27;s diary from the eve of the Brexit referendum in 2016 to the UK&#x27;s eventual exit from the EU. The book was serialised in the Daily Mail.

===Television and radio===
Duncan appeared four times on the satirical news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;: first appearing on 28 October 2005,
then 20 October 2006,
and again on 2 May 2008
and 24 April 2009.
His 2009 appearance featured a badly received ironic joke about murdering the latest Miss California, who stated that she opposed same-sex marriages.
He appeared on many occasions as a panellist on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions?&quot; In 2006, he took part in a documentary entitled &quot;How to beat Jeremy Paxman&quot;.

<doc id="414467" wikidata="Q2029521" url="?curid=414467" title="1994 Oregon Ballot Measure 16">
<text>Measure 16 of 1994 established the U.S. state of Oregon&#x27;s Death with Dignity Act (ORS 127.800–995), which legalizes medical aid in dying (commonly referred to as physician-assisted suicide) with certain restrictions. Passage of this initiative made Oregon the first U.S. state and one of the first jurisdictions in the world to permit some terminally ill patients to determine the time of their own death.

The measure was approved in the November 8, 1994, general election. 627,980 votes (51.3%) were cast in favor, 596,018 votes (48.7%) against. An injunction delayed implementation of the Act until it was lifted on October 27, 1997. Measure 51, referred in the wake of the US Supreme Court&#x27;s 1997 ruling in &quot;Washington v. Glucksberg&quot; by the state legislature in November 1997, sought to repeal the Death with Dignity Act, but was rejected by 60% of voters. The act was challenged by the George W. Bush administration, but was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Gonzales v. Oregon&quot; in 2006.

== The law ==
Under the law, any competent adult who has been diagnosed, by a physician, with a terminal illness that will kill the patient within six months may request in writing, from his or her physician, a prescription for a lethal dose of medication for the purpose of ending the patient&#x27;s life. Exercise of the option under this law is voluntary and the patient must initiate the request. Any physician, pharmacist, or other healthcare provider who has moral objections has the right to refuse to participate.

The request must be confirmed by two witnesses, at least one of whom is not related to the patient, is not entitled to any portion of the patient&#x27;s estate, is not the patient&#x27;s physician, and is not employed by a health care facility caring for the patient. After the request is made, another physician must examine the patient&#x27;s medical records and confirm the diagnosis. The patient must be determined to be free of a mental condition impairing judgment. If the request is authorized, the patient must wait at least fifteen days and make a second oral request before the prescription may be written. The patient has a right to rescind the request at any time. Should either physician have concerns about the patient&#x27;s ability to make an informed decision, or feel the patient&#x27;s request may be motivated by depression or coercion, the patient must be referred for a psychological evaluation.

The law protects doctors from liability for providing a lethal prescription for a terminally ill, competent adult in compliance with the statute&#x27;s restrictions. Participation by physicians, pharmacists, and health care providers is voluntary. The law also specifies a patient&#x27;s decision to end his or her life shall not &quot;have an effect upon a life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policy.&quot;

==Impact==
From the beginning of 1999 through the end of 2015, a total of 1,545 people have had prescriptions written and 991 patients have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the act.

The median age of the 991 patients who died from ingesting medication was 71; 77.1 percent of patients had malignant neoplasms (cancer). Of the 991, 51.4% were male (48.6% female); 45.5% had a Baccalaureate degree or higher; 45.3% were married; primary end of life concerns were loss of autonomy (91.6%), inability to make life enjoyable (89.7%), and loss of dignity (78.7%).

An independent study published in the October 2007 issue of the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; reports there was &quot;no evidence of heightened risk for the elderly, women, the uninsured, people with low educational status, the poor, the physically disabled or chronically ill, minors, people with psychiatric illnesses including depression, or racial or ethnic minorities, compared with background populations.&quot;

The Death with Dignity Act was the basis of the Washington Death with Dignity Act in 2008. In 2011 the documentary film &quot;How to Die in Oregon&quot; was released. It won the Grand Jury prize for documentary film at the 27th Sundance Film Festival.

According to Dignity in Dying, Lord Falconer&#x27;s Assisted Dying Bill, first tabled in the House of Lords in June 2014, &quot;draws on the experience&quot; of the Death with Dignity Act.

==Attempts to repeal==
In addition to arguments against physician-assisted dying, opponents feared that terminally ill people throughout the nation would flock to Oregon to take advantage of the law. This fear has not been realized, largely because drafters of the law limited its use to Oregon residents.
Despite the measure&#x27;s passage, implementation was tied up in the courts for several years.

In 1997, the Oregon Legislative Assembly referred Measure 51, which would have repealed the act, to the ballot.

Proponents of Measure 51 argued that the Death with Dignity Act lacked a mandatory counseling provision, a family notification provision, strong reporting requirements, or a strong residency requirement. Measure 51 opponents argued that sending the measure back to voters was disrespectful considering they had already passed Measure 16 via the initiative process. They also felt that the safeguards in the Death with Dignity Act were adequate.

Measure 51 was defeated in the November 4, 1997, special election with 445,830 votes in favor, and 666,275 votes against.

Some members of the United States Congress, notably Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, tried to block implementation of Measure 16, but failed.

In 2002, federal judge Robert E. Jones blocked a move by United States Attorney General John Ashcroft to suspend the license for prescribing drugs covered in the Controlled Substances Act of doctors who prescribed life-ending medications under the Oregon law. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the block, stating that the &quot;Attorney General lacked Congress&#x27; requisite authorization&quot;.

In October 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Oregon&quot; to determine the fate of the Death with Dignity law. Arguing on behalf of the state was Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Robert Atkinson. Oregon&#x27;s five Democratic members of Congress also filed a brief in support of the State&#x27;s position. United States Solicitor General Paul Clement argued on behalf of the Bush administration, which challenged Oregon&#x27;s right to regulate the practice of medicine when that practice entails prescribing federally controlled substances. On January 17, 2006, the court ruled 6–3 in favor of Oregon, upholding the law.

<doc id="414468" wikidata="Q983443" url="?curid=414468" title="William Jefferson (politician)">
<text>William Jennings Jefferson (born March 14, 1947) is an American former politician from Louisiana whose career ended after his corruption scandal and conviction. He served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for nine terms from 1991 to 2009 as a member of the Democratic Party. He represented , which includes much of the greater New Orleans area. He was elected as the state&#x27;s first black congressman since the end of Reconstruction.

On November 13, 2009, Jefferson was sentenced to thirteen years in federal prison for bribery after a corruption investigation, the longest sentence ever given to a congressman. He began serving that sentence in May 2012 at a Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facility in Beaumont, Texas.

He appealed his case after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on similar issues. In light of these findings, on October 5, 2017, Jefferson was ordered released, pending sentencing or other action, after a U.S. District judge threw out seven of ten charges against him. On December 1, 2017, Judge T. S. Ellis III accepted his plea deal and sentenced Jefferson to time served.

==Early life and family==
Jefferson was born on March 14, 1947, in Lake Providence, the parish seat of East Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana. He and his eight brothers and sisters worked alongside their father on their farm, and Jefferson was also a heavy-equipment operator for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Jeffersons were among the few African-American families in the area who in the mid-20th century owned their land (as opposed to sharecropping). They were regarded with respect, but the family struggled in poverty.

Jefferson graduated from G. W. Griffin High School in Lake Providence. In 1969, Jefferson received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Southern University, a historically black college in Baton Rouge, where he had participated in Army ROTC. In 1969 he led a protest against substandard campus facilities and negotiated a resolution of the complaint with then-Governor John J. McKeithen. On graduation from Southern University, Jefferson was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army; he served in a reserve capacity until 1975. In 1972, he earned a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School. In 1996, he received a LLM in taxation from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C.

In 1972 and 1973 Jefferson began the practice of law, having initially served as a clerk for Judge Alvin Benjamin Rubin of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.

Jefferson is the brother of Betty Jefferson, who became assessor for New Orleans and a Democratic field operative; Mose Jefferson, Archie Jefferson, and Brenda Jefferson Foster. He is the uncle of Angela Coleman.

Jefferson and his wife, Andrea Jefferson, have five daughters: Jamila Jefferson-Jones, Jalila Jefferson-Bullock (a former Louisiana State Representative), Jelani Jefferson Exum (a professor of law at the University of Toledo), Nailah Jefferson (a documentary filmmaker), and Akilah Jefferson. Jamila, Jalila, and Jelani are all graduates of Harvard College and Harvard Law School. Nailah is a graduate of Boston University and Emerson College. Akilah, a graduate of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, attends the Tulane University School of Medicine.

==Political career in New Orleans==
From 1973 to 1975, Jefferson was a legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. Jefferson moved to New Orleans in 1976 and was elected to the Louisiana Senate in 1979, where he served until 1990. He twice unsuccessfully ran for New Orleans mayor, having, along with Ron Faucheux, first challenged Dutch Morial in the election of 1982. He was defeated by Sidney Barthelemy in the mayoral runoff of 1986. During the 1982 mayoral race, Morial attacked Jefferson by calling him &quot;Dollar Bill&quot;. Jefferson was considered a rising star in Louisiana politics, with some suggesting he would be his state&#x27;s second African-American governor.

In 1990, midway through his third term in the state senate, Jefferson ran in the nonpartisan blanket primary for Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district seat after 10-term incumbent Lindy Boggs announced her retirement. He finished first in the seven-candidate field with 24 percent of the vote. In the runoff, he defeated Marc Morial, the son of Dutch Morial, with 52 percent of the vote. He was reelected seven times.

In the House, Jefferson joined the Congressional Black Caucus. He considered running for governor in 1995 but did not do so.

Jefferson ran for governor of Louisiana in the 1999 Louisiana gubernatorial election, and was the de facto &quot;official&quot; Democratic candidate. However, he lost badly to incumbent Republican Mike Foster, having tallied 29.5 percent of the vote and carrying only New Orleans (coextensive with Orleans Parish) and his native East Carroll Parish, whose seat is Lake Providence.

==Local influence==
Jefferson and his family controlled one of the most sophisticated and effective get-out-the-vote organizations in South Louisiana – the Progressive Democrats. Journalist Laura Maggi has described Mose Jefferson, a brother of William, as &quot;the man responsible for running the Progressive Democrats street operation&quot; in New Orleans.

His opponents, Ken Carter and Jim Singleton, founded the Black Organization for Leadership Development as an alternative group. In 2002, the Progressive Democrats&#x27; support helped elect Jefferson&#x27;s protégée Renée Gill Pratt to the New Orleans City Council. Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Jalila was defeated by Rosalind Peychaud in a special election for Gill Pratt&#x27;s District 91 seat in the Louisiana State House. She defeated Peychaud in the next regular election. Jefferson&#x27;s Progressive Democrats organization also contributed to the election of Jefferson&#x27;s sister Betty, as a municipal assessor, in 1998, 2002 and 2006.

New Orleans politics substantially changed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as many former residents have never returned to the city, changing the demographics of voters. A few days after Hurricane Katrina, Jefferson was reported to have used a Louisiana National Guard detachment to recover personal effects and belongings from his home. After the truck in which he and the detachment traveled became stuck, the Guard helicopter aided Jefferson&#x27;s party while rescue operations in the city were still underway.

==2006 election==
In the ensuing 2006 election cycle for Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, eight Democrats, three Republicans, and one Libertarian challengers stood for election against Jefferson. Jefferson had been named as a subject in a corruption probe.

None of the candidates obtained more than 50% of the vote on the first ballot (November 7, 2006), forcing a runoff. The two candidates who survived the first ballot were both African-American Democrats: Jefferson got 30% of the vote, and State Representative Karen Carter, who enjoyed support from the Louisiana Democratic Party’s establishment, picked up nearly all endorsements from local politicians and the local press; she gathered 22% of the vote. Carter was Jefferson&#x27;s first credible challenger since his initial run for Congress.

Political commentators predicted an easy victory for Carter on the second ballot (to be held on December 9, 2006). In the last week of campaign, however, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee, a law and order Democrat, urged voters against Carter. She had criticized the conduct of Gretna police officers and Jefferson Parish deputies in the aftermath of Katrina, as they had prevented evacuees from fleeing New Orleans. Lee mailed out 25,000 fliers and made public statements attacking Carter. The campaign generated much controversy, highlighting racial differences between the parishes.

Voter turnout dwindled from 24.15% to 16.25%. While residents of the city of New Orleans gave Jefferson a slight majority over Carter, (51% to 49%); the Jefferson Parish share of the district voted for Jefferson by a staggering 71% to 29%, clearly swinging the election in his favor.

Following Jefferson&#x27;s reelection, Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi announced that Jefferson would not regain his seat on the Ways and Means Committee as long as he is not &quot;cleared of wrongdoing in an ongoing federal corruption probe&quot;.

==2008 campaign==
In 2008, Jefferson sought re-election while under indictment for bribery. Six Democrats challenged him for the seat in the Democratic primary. The voting was delayed due to Hurricane Gustav.

In the October 4, 2008 Democratic primary, opposition to Jefferson was split among seven contenders. Some of the challengers made strong showings in their base neighborhoods but failed to garner much support in other parts of the district. Jefferson ran second, third, or even fourth in many precincts, but his 25% total was enough to give him a plurality and to send him into the runoff primary, where he faced Helena Moreno, a former TV newscaster, on November 4. Aided by overwhelming support from African-American voters on the same date as the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama drew them to the polls in unprecedented numbers, Jefferson won the Democratic nomination in the congressional party primary, which barred the district&#x27;s 41,000 Republicans and many of its 84,000 other voters not registered as Democrats. Jefferson won the November 4 Democratic runoff.

The general election round occurred on December 6, 2008. Jefferson faced Republican candidate Anh &quot;Joseph&quot; Cao, Green Party candidate Malik Rahim, and Libertarian Party candidate Gregory Kahn. An earlier candidate, independent Jerry Jacobs, withdrew.

Jefferson was defeated in the general election on December 6, 2008 in a major upset by Republican nominee Cao, who had endorsements from several prominent Democrats including Moreno and City Councilwomen Jackie Clarkson and Stacy Head. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin endorsed Jefferson. Cao won by three percentage points. Jefferson was the third Democratic incumbent since the end of Reconstruction to lose to a Republican at the federal level in Louisiana. (But in Louisiana as in other parts of the South, many conservative whites left the Democratic Party for the Republican Party, and alliances have shifted.)

Jefferson&#x27;s loss evoked a sensation because of the overwhelmingly Democratic nature of the district; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+28, it is the third-most Democratic district in the South. Democrats usually win local and state races in landslides. Barack Obama carried the district with 72 percent of the vote in the 2008 presidential election.

Jefferson became the third African-American incumbent Congressman to be unseated in a general election.

==Corruption case==
In mid-2005, an investor in the Louisville, Kentucky-based IT firm iGate pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery and the payment of $400,000 in bribes to a public official — a then-unnamed member of the U.S. House of Representatives later alleged to be Jefferson. In return for these bribes, the public official was alleged to have agreed to persuading the U.S. Army to test iGate&#x27;s broadband two-way technology and other iGate products; influencing high-ranking officials in Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon; and meeting with personnel of the Export-Import Bank of the United States in order to facilitate potential financing for iGate business deals in those countries.

Based on these allegations, the FBI raided Jefferson&#x27;s Congressional offices in May 2006. On June 4, 2007, a federal grand jury indicted Jefferson on sixteen felony charges related to corruption, including bribery, racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering, obstruction of justice and other offenses. Jefferson was defeated by Republican Joseph Cao on December 6, 2008, and became the most senior Democrat to lose re-election that year.

In 2009, he was tried in Virginia on federal corruption charges. On August 5, 2009, he was found guilty of eleven of the sixteen corruption counts. On November 13, 2009, Jefferson was sentenced to thirteen years, the longest sentence given to a congressman for bribery or any other crime.

On March 26, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed Jefferson&#x27;s conviction and sentence on ten of the eleven counts on which he was convicted. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the conviction on one count of the indictment, involving alleged wire fraud, holding that venue on that count was improper in the federal court in Virginia.

On April 20, 2012, U.S. District Court judge T. S. Ellis III revoked Jefferson&#x27;s bail and ordered that he report to prison by May 4, 2012 to begin serving his thirteen-year sentence. He reported as ordered at the BOP facility in Beaumont, Texas. He was scheduled for release on August 30, 2023.

Jefferson owed $5 million in legal fees and filed for bankruptcy. On May 1, 2015, Jefferson was permanently disbarred by the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

In the 2016 US Supreme Court case of &quot;McDonnell v. United States&quot;, the Court remanded the case to the lower court based on issues with the corruption charges against former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. The Justice Department has since dropped the case and will not prosecute again. Jefferson appealed and U.S. District Judge T. S. Ellis of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia threw out 7 of the most substantive of 10 charges against him on October 5, 2017: dropping convictions for &quot;two counts of soliciting bribes, two counts of wire fraud, and three counts of money laundering.&quot;

The judge ordered him released while the government determined the sentence or plans for a retrial. On December 1, the government and Jefferson agreed that (1) given Judge Ellis&#x27; ruling dismissing some of the counts, one of the three remaining counts also had to be dismissed; and (2) given the time Jefferson already served in prison as well as the expense involved in continued litigation, the parties agreed that if on resentencing Judge Ellis imposed a sentence of time-served, neither party would take any further appeals from Judge Ellis&#x27; decision in which he dismissed most, but not all, of the counts against Jefferson. Judge Ellis subsequently sentenced the former congressman to time served, having spent five and a half years of his initial thirteen-year sentence in federal prison.

==Charges against relatives==
On May 22, 2009, Betty Jefferson, Mose Jefferson, Angela Coleman, and Mose&#x27;s longtime companion, former New Orleans City Councilwoman Renée Gill Pratt, were indicted for violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. On June 5, 2009, all the defendants pleaded not guilty. Their sister Brenda Jefferson Foster was serving as a witness in the government&#x27;s case against them. Mose Jefferson is also facing a separate trial on charges of bribing Orleans Parish School Board president Ellenese Brooks-Simms. On July 28, 2009, United States federal judge Ivan L. R. Lemelle delayed the start of the racketeering trial to January 25, 2010.

On January 10, 2010, Mose Jefferson was convicted of bribery and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. On February 26, 2010, Betty Jefferson and Angela Coleman pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy. They were expected to testify for the government in the fraud and corruption trial against Mose Jefferson and Pratt.

During these respective periods of marriage, both men were Oona King&#x27;s uncles. On her father&#x27;s side, she comes from a line of American civil rights activists and successful entrepreneurs. Her paternal grandfather, civil rights activist Clennon Washington King Sr., and his wife had a daughter and seven sons, including her uncle C. B. King, a pioneering civil rights attorney in Albany, Georgia. King&#x27;s maternal grandfather was born Jewish, and her maternal grandmother converted to Judaism. Through her maternal grandmother, King is a first cousin, once removed, of Ted Graham, Baron Graham of Edmonton.

King was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive Secondary School on Crogsland Road in Chalk Farm (borough of Camden), London. She was a contemporary of fellow Labour politicians David Miliband and his younger brother Ed.

In her first year as an undergraduate at University of York, King was briefly a member of the Socialist Workers Party. During her second year (1988–89), she gained a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley and graduated with a first class honours degree in politics in 1990.

==Political career==
Before becoming a member of parliament, King was a researcher for the European Parliament. She also worked as a political assistant to Glyn Ford MEP, the Labour Party Leader in the European Parliament, and later Glenys Kinnock MEP. In 1995–97, she was a political organiser for the GMB Southern Region.

She was selected to represent the seat of Bethnal Green and Bow early in 1997. Peter Shore had announced his retirement early, but factional fighting in the constituency Labour Party led to party headquarters delaying the selection and imposing its own shortlist. Some leading candidates from the local Bangladeshi community were not included.

===Parliamentary career===
Winning the seat in 1997, King became the second black woman to be elected as a member of parliament, the first having been Diane Abbott. In her &quot;truly first-class maiden speech&quot;, King described the racial abuse she and her family had suffered as a child. She referred to herself as &quot;multi-ethnic&quot;, representing &quot;a truly multicultural constituency where hardship and deprivation gave birth to Britain&#x27;s greatest social reforms.&quot; She described William Beveridge and Clement Attlee as &quot;surrounded by an East End infant mortality rate of 55%&quot; and said this led to social reforms, including the NHS. She emphasised a need for coherence in the strategy for eradicating poverty, and the importance of education in its elimination.

King served on the international development select committee, and as the vice-chair of the All-Parliamentary Group on Bangladesh. She was selected to second the Queen&#x27;s Speech debate in November 2002, where she also discussed her views on genocide and a visit to Rwanda. King served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister for e-commerce. In 2003 she was selected as one of &quot;100 Great Black Britons&quot;.

King supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was controversial for her constituency&#x27;s large Muslim population. In 2007, King said that she does not regret voting for the war in Iraq, &quot;I could never have voted against getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He was responsible for the deaths of one million people.&quot; She had said in September 2005, after seeing how poorly the United States had handled the crisis of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in New Orleans, that:

it shows that America has no grasp whatever on the activity needed to rebuild a destroyed city. And if they can&#x27;t do that in their own country, then it&#x27;s obvious why they can&#x27;t do it in Iraq. So ... I regret that we went to war with a country that has shown itself to be incapable of the very basic actions required to deal with post-conflict reconstruction.

===2005 general election===
Bethnal Green and Bow, with a population of approximately 45,000 Muslim residents, was seen as George Galloway&#x27;s best chance to defeat a Labour candidate in what became a &quot;bitter single issue campaign&quot; over King&#x27;s support for the Iraq War. King described the contest as &quot;one of the dirtiest ... we have ever seen in British politics&quot; and complained of &quot;quite disturbing&quot; anti-semitic and racial abuse. Galloway said Labour&#x27;s postal vote strategy in the seat was &quot;close to illegal, if not illegal&quot;.

Both candidates were given police protection, King after her car tyres were slashed and Galloway after receiving a death threat. King lost the seat by 823 votes, a 26.2% swing from King to Galloway. King said that, whilst her support for the war in Iraq had been a major issue, false claims in the Bangladeshi press that she wanted to get rid of halal meat had played a part in her defeat.

===2005–2009===
King had said that she would remain in Bethnal Green and Bow with her constituency office funded from the GMB trade union, attempting to act as an unofficial MP. However, later in 2005, she began a career in the media, saying &quot;I wanted to be an MP all my life, and when it didn&#x27;t work, I thought, well then, I&#x27;ll just have to go down a different path.&quot; In 2007, King published her autobiography, &quot;The Oona King Diaries: House Music&quot;.

In 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed her to act as his Senior Policy Adviser on Equalities and Diversity and Faith. In January 2009, King was appointed head of diversity at Channel 4. Before relocating to the United States she lived in Mile End, in a converted pub, in the East End of London.

===2010 London mayoral campaign===
In 2010, King unsuccessfully challenged Ken Livingstone for the Labour Party nomination in the 2012 election for Mayor of London. King&#x27;s first campaign speech, at Haverstock school, focused on &quot;engagement with young people&quot; as a way of reducing knife crime and helping them achieve their potential. In June 2010, she was shortlisted for the nomination. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, King emphasised both her experience of &quot;pushing and pulling the levers of power&quot;, i.e. her experience of negotiating with top ministers, and also her willingness to work with political opponents.

Her opponent, Ken Livingstone, accused her of using inappropriate methods of obtaining email addresses of Labour Party supporters; King denied the allegation. King had the backing of Neil Kinnock, Ben Bradshaw, and Alan Johnson. On 24 September 2010, Livingstone won the nomination.

===Peerage===
On 26 January 2011, King was created a life peer as Baroness King of Bow, &quot;of Bow in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&quot;. She was introduced in the House of Lords on 31 January 2011, where she sat on the Labour benches. When her appointment was announced in November 2010, she resigned as a constituency representative to the Labour National Executive Committee, to which she had recently been elected, before attending her first meeting. Upon taking her seat in the Lords, King stood down from her Diversity Officer role with Channel 4. In 2012, King was elected to the Progress strategy board as a parliamentarian.

In 2016, she took a leave of absence from the Lords to take a role as YouTube Diversity Director. In 2019, she left Google to join Snap, Inc. as their first VP of diversity and inclusion. King was also listed in the annual &quot;Powerlist&quot; as one of the most influential people of African/African-Caribbean descent in the UK.

In January 2024, King announced that she has left Snap, Inc. to join Uber as Chief Diversity And Inclusion Officer. She retired from the House of Lords on 9 July 2024.

==Media work==
King has made appearances on television shows such as &quot;This Week&quot;, &quot;The Daily Politics&quot;, &quot;The All Star Talent Show&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. She hosted a BBC Two documentary on Martin Luther King Jr. and the deep South entitled &quot;American Prophet&quot;, aired on 29 March 2008. She made appearances on the new comedic show &quot;Jews at Ten&quot; on Channel 4, 9 October 2012. In January 2013, she appeared on the ITV skating show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, being voted off on 20 January.

==Personal life==
In 1994, King married Italian Tiberio Santomarco, while working for an MEP in Brussels. The couple have adopted three children, and have a fourth child born to a surrogate mother in 2013. She speaks Italian and French fluently.

<doc id="414471" wikidata="Q334128" url="?curid=414471" title="Helen Liddell">
<text>Helen Lawrie Liddell, Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke PC (&#x27;Reilly; born 6 December 1950) is a British politician and life peer who served as Secretary of State for Scotland from 2001 to 2003 and British High Commissioner to Australia from 2005 to 2009. A member of the Labour Party, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Airdrie and Shotts, previously Monklands East, from 1994 to 2005.

==Early life==
Liddell was born to Hugh Reilly, a Catholic, and Bridget Lawrie Reilly, a Protestant. She was educated at St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic High School in Coatbridge, attending at the same time as John Reid, and graduated from the University of Strathclyde with a BA in Economics.

==Early career==
Liddell worked as a BBC Scotland economics journalist from 1976 to 1977. At the age of 26, she served as the first female General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party from 1977 to 1988. She was subsequently public affairs director of the &quot;Daily Record&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, working for media proprietor Robert Maxwell.

== Business Interests ==
Appointed Director of Annington Limited, 1 April 2017. The British Ministry of Defence, as of November 2022, are trying to regain ownership of the housing stock that was sold off to Annington in 1996. As Chair of Annington, Baroness Liddell defended Annington via a letter to the British Defence Secretary saying she was &quot;shocked&quot; by the Government&#x27;s approach.

==Parliamentary career==
She first contested the Parliamentary constituency of East Fife at the October 1974 general election.

=== House of Commons ===
Liddell was first elected to Parliament in 1994, at the closely contested Monklands East by-election following John Smith&#x27;s death. She was appointed a Privy Councillor on 27 October 1998.

She was Secretary of State for Scotland from 2001 to 2003, a position whose powers had been transferred to the Scottish Executive after devolution in 1999. In addition, she angered the monks of Buckfast Abbey when she called on them to stop selling Buckfast in Scotland. She was dubbed &quot;Minister for Monarch of the Glen&quot; after several visits to the set of the hit BBC series.

The disclosure that she was able to work French lessons into her ministerial diary, raised questions about the relevance of Scottish Secretary&#x27;s job post-devolution. The role was abolished as a full-time position in 2003, when the Scotland Office was rolled into the Department for Constitutional Affairs.

She took up appointment as British High Commissioner to Australia in the summer of 2005, and was succeeded in the role by Baroness Amos in October 2009.

=== House of Lords ===
On 28 May 2010, it was announced in the Dissolution Honours List that she would be created a life peer. On 7 July, she took the title &quot;Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke, of Airdrie in the County of Lanarkshire&quot;, six days later becoming a House of Lords member. She is a member of Labour Friends of Israel. In 2010–11 Liddell was a member of the independent Philips inquiry into the 1994 Scotland RAF Chinook crash on the Mull of Kintyre, established by the Secretary of State for Defence.

==Personal life==
She married Alistair Liddell in 1972; they have one son and one daughter.

<doc id="414473" wikidata="Q863238" url="?curid=414473" title="Billy Tauzin">
<text>Wilbert Joseph Tauzin II (; born June 14, 1943) is an American lobbyist and politician. He served as the President and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a pharmaceutical company lobby group, from 2005 to 2010.

After serving four terms in the State House, Tauzin won a special election to the United States House of Representatives, and served from 1980 to 2005. He was consistently re-elected as a Democrat representing Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district until 1995, when he joined the Republican Party and continued to be re-elected to his seat for another decade.

==Personal life==
Of Cajun descent, Wilbert Joseph Tauzin II is a lifelong resident of Chackbay, a small town just outside Thibodaux. He graduated from Nicholls State University in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and earned a J.D. degree from Louisiana State University in 1967. While attending law school, he served as a legislative aide in the Louisiana state Senate.

Wilbert Joseph Tauzin II is married to Cecile Tauzin and has five children from a previous marriage.

==Political career==
Tauzin began his elective career in 1972 when he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives, serving four full terms as a Democratic Rep. In his first term, he served alongside fellow Democrats Dick Guidry and Leonard J. Chabert.

In 1979, David C. Treen, the U.S. representative from Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, was elected as the state&#x27;s first Republican governor in more than a century. He had served as the first Republican representative from Louisiana since Reconstruction.

Treen resigned his House seat on March 10, 1980. Tauzin won a special election for the seat on May 17 and was sworn into office on May 22, just five months after winning a fifth term in the state house. He won the congressional race by seven points, defeating Democratic State Senator Anthony Guarisco Jr., of Morgan City and Jim Donelon, of Jefferson Parish, who had left the Democratic Party for the Republican one.

Tauzin won a full term in November 1980, with 85 percent of the vote against minimal opposition. For 15 years, he was known as one of the more conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives. Even though he eventually rose to become an assistant majority whip, he felt shut out by some of his more liberal colleagues and sometimes had to ask the Republicans for floor time. When the Democrats lost control of the House after the 1994 elections, Tauzin was one of the co-founders of the House Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate-to-conservative Democrats.

In 1987, Tauzin ran for governor of Louisiana but lost to colleague Buddy Roemer, also a Congressman. The incumbent, Edwin Edwards, had a weakened second-place showing and withdrew from a runoff election. Others in the race were Republican U.S. Representative Bob Livingston of the New Orleans suburbs and two other Democrats: former U.S. Representative Speedy Long and Louisiana Secretary of State James H. &quot;Jim&quot; Brown.

Finally on August 8, 1995, Tauzin himself became a Republican, claiming that conservatives were no longer welcome in the Democratic Party. He soon became a deputy majority whip. He was the first representative to have been part of the leadership of each party in the House. Regardless of party, Tauzin remained popular at home. After 1980, he was re-elected twelve more times without major-party opposition; the first nine times he was completely unopposed.

Tauzin served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2001 to February 4, 2004, when he announced that he would not run for a 13th full term. He has five children from his first marriage and backed his son, Billy Tauzin III, as his replacement. He appeared in ads that were criticized for blurring the lines on which man was actually running for Congress. In spite of his father&#x27;s support, the younger Tauzin was defeated by 569 votes by a Democrat, Charlie Melancon.

During his tenure, Wilbert Joseph Tauzin II left his mark on issues ranging from natural gas, airline, trucking, and electricity deregulation to the Clean Air Act, Superfund, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In addition, he was an original author of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Cable Act, both of which became law despite a Presidential veto.

In 2003, he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

==Lobbyist==
In January 2005, the day after his term in Congress ended, he began work as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). a powerful trade group for pharmaceutical companies. Tauzin was hired at a salary outsiders estimated at $2 million a year. Five years later, he announced his retirement from the association (as of the end of June 2010).

Two months before resigning as chair of the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees the drug industry, Tauzin had played a key role in shepherding through Congress the Medicare Prescription Drug Bill. Democrats said that the bill was &quot;a give-away to the drugmakers&quot; because it prohibited the government from negotiating lower drug prices and bans the importation of identical cheaper drugs from Canada and elsewhere.

The Veterans Affairs agency, which can negotiate drug prices, pays much less than Medicare. The bill was passed in an unusual congressional session at 3 a.m. under strong pressure from the drug companies.

As head of PhRMA, Tauzin was a key figure in 2009 health care reform negotiations that produced pharmaceutical industry support for White House and Senate efforts.

Tauzin received $11.6 million from PhRMA in 2010, making him the highest-paid health law lobbyist. Since 2005, Tauzin has been on the Board of Directors at LHC Group.

==Controversies==
===Jerome Schneider===
Tauzin endorsed Jerome Schneider&#x27;s book &quot;The Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens&quot; by dubbing the book, &quot;A serious contender for the best book on offshore banking I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Tauzin also spoke at one of Schneider&#x27;s tax conferences. After Schneider pleaded guilty in 2004 to assisting hundreds of people to avoid taxes through sham offshore banks, a spokesperson for Tauzin called his endorsement &quot;a stupid mistake.&quot;

===Connections to pharmaceutical industry===
In his capacity as chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Tauzin &quot;was one of the chief architects of the Medicare bill&quot;. Tauzin&#x27;s appointment shortly afterward (the day after retiring from Congress) as chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade association and lobby group for the drug industry, drew criticism from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which claimed that Tauzin &quot;may have been negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation&quot;.

 The Obama-Biden 2008 election campaign criticised Tauzin and other like-minded politicians.

<doc id="414474" wikidata="Q19397" url="?curid=414474" title="Alun Michael">
<text>Alun Edward Michael (born 22 August 1943) is a Welsh Labour and Co-operative retired politician. He served as Secretary of State for Wales from 1998 to 1999 and then as the first First Secretary of Wales (later known as First Minister) and Leader of Welsh Labour from 1999 to 2000. He went on to serve as South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner from 2012 to 2024.

Born on the island of Anglesey, Michael attended Colwyn Bay Grammar School and graduated from the University of Keele in 1966 with a degree in Philosophy and English. He worked as a reporter for the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; until 1971 and then as a youth and community worker until 1987. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1972 and served on the Cardiff City Council from 1973 to 1989. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1987, succeeding former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan for the constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth.

In opposition, he was a Shadow Home Affairs Minister and then when Labour came to power in 1997 he served as a Minister of State for Home Affairs until 1998. In October of that year, Ron Davies resigned as Secretary of State for Wales and Leader of Welsh Labour following the &quot;Moment of Madness&quot; scandal and Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed Michael to succeed him in the former role. In May 1999, following the first elections to the National Assembly for Wales, Michael defeated Rhodri Morgan to become the new Welsh Labour leader and thus the inaugural First Secretary of Wales. The position was later renamed First Minister of Wales under the tenure of his successor.

Michael resigned as Leader of Welsh Labour and First Secretary nine months later to avoid a vote of no confidence. He resigned from the Welsh Assembly shortly after and served in various junior ministerial positions in the Labour government at Westminster. He resigned from the House of Commons in October 2012 to stand for the newly created position of Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales, to which he was elected in November 2012 and re-elected in 2016 and 2021. In June 2023 it was announced he would not contest the 2024 election; he was succeeded by his deputy Emma Wools on 8 May 2024, after her electoral victory the previous week.

==Background and family life==
Michael was born at Bryngwran, Anglesey, the son of Leslie and Betty Michael. He attended Colwyn Bay Grammar School and studied at Keele University for four years from 1962 to 1966 obtaining a BA degree in Philosophy and English.

==Professional career==
He was a reporter for the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot;, a Cardiff-based evening newspaper, where he was a contemporary of Michael Buerk (later to become a distinguished BBC correspondent) and of Sue Lawley (later to become presenter of the BBC magazine programme Nationwide). In his autobiography Michael Buerk wrote &quot;Alun Michael with his ginger toothbrush-moustache and battered corduroy jacket, was a rather Pooterish character for the Sixties. He did not stay in journalism, which was no surprise, but went into politics, which certainly was&quot;. Michael in fact left journalism in 1971 and spent 16 years until 1987 as a &quot;youth and community worker&quot; before entering Parliament. In 1972 he was appointed a justice of the peace, chairing the Cardiff Juvenile Bench.

==Political career==
Michael was a member of Cardiff City Council for the Rumney ward, subsequently the Trowbridge ward from 1973 until 1989.

He became an MP at the 1987 general election, inheriting a safe Labour seat from former prime minister James Callaghan. Michael retained this seat in 1992, 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2010 although with declining majorities at each election from 1997 onwards.

===Home Office===
Michael was a Shadow Home Affairs Minister while in opposition, prior to becoming a Minister of State in the Home Office (he likes to describe himself as having been &quot;Deputy Home Secretary&quot;) following Labour&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1997 general election. His rhetoric when coming to office differed from the eventual delivery. As Home Office minister, he pledged there would be &quot;no hiding place for paedophiles&quot; as there would &quot;be cases where the public will have to be told directly that a paedophile is in their area. Several frightening cases in recent months have hammered it home that we must act.&quot; This policy was not realised, and following the case of eight-year-old Sarah Payne and calls for his original policy to be introduced, Michael agreed with the approach being taken by then Dyfed Powys Chief Constable Terence Grange, who said such a plan would drive paedophiles underground. He said &quot;(Grange) warned of the dangers of having open access leading to paedophiles disappearing and therefore posing an even greater risk&quot;. Michael defended his decision not to introduce &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Law&quot; saying, &quot;These are extremely difficult issues and people are understandably very upset, but there is a danger of serious mistakes being made and this has been shown on a number occasions.&quot;.

Michael was however responsible for steering the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 through the House of Commons. Amongst other things, this Act introduced ASBOs or Anti-social Behaviour Orders and statutory crime reduction partnerships. He was also responsible for the Government policy on the voluntary and community sector, and introduced the &quot;compact&quot; process to achieve partnership between Government and that sector. Michael later became a member of the Justice Select Committee from November 2007 to May 2010. While on the committee he took part in enquiries into restorative justice, devolution ten years on, the role of the prison officer, and the work of the Crown Prosecution Service.

===Wales career===
In May 1997 Ron Davies was appointed by Tony Blair to the cabinet position of Secretary of State for Wales and then, in September 1998, narrowly defeated Rhodri Morgan in an internal contest for the Labour leadership in Wales. The first election for the National Assembly of Wales was due to be held in May 1999. Should Labour form a government, the Welsh Labour leader would then become what was to be called &quot;First Secretary&quot; – potentially giving Davies a role in both the UK and Welsh legislatures.

However, on 27 October 1998, Davies abruptly resigned as Secretary of State for Wales after adverse publicity about his personal life. Tony Blair overlooked Morgan (then MP for Cardiff West) and appointed Michael as the new Secretary of State for Wales.

Two days later, on 29 October 1998, Davies also resigned the Labour Leadership in Wales, thus relinquishing his ambition to become First Secretary and initiating another leadership contest. Blair again overlooked Morgan and opted to back Michael for the position. According to Neath MP Peter Hain &quot;Rhodri was the party&#x27;s favourite and feelings ran very high&quot; but nevertheless, in a volte-face, Hain agreed to run the campaign for Michael who he described as &quot;the establishment candidate&quot;. Although Morgan had the overwhelming support of individual Labour Party members, Michael, backed by Blair and by the trade unions, won the election. This episode led to Michael being described as a &quot;famously tetchy Millbank-backed candidate&quot;. The affair was described by Peter Kellner as &quot;another fix&quot; in order &quot;to ensure Alun Michael became Labour&#x27;s leader in Wales&quot; which Kellner said &quot;offended so many voters that it lost some of its safest seats, including Rhondda, to Plaid Cymru&quot;. Tony Blair&#x27;s favourable treatment of Michael was later described by Kellner as a &quot;determination to foist Alun Michael on the people of Wales&quot;, which &quot;produced a spectacular collapse of support&quot;. Michael stressed his Welsh credentials, as someone who had grown up in North Wales, lived for 30 years in South Wales and was a speaker of Welsh. He had approached Blair at a very early stage to suggest he stood for the Welsh Assembly elections.

The first Assembly election resulted in the Welsh Labour Party winning less than half of the available seats. In the first plenary on 12 May 1999 Michael was elected First Secretary. 

Rather than form a coalition, Michael took the unconventional route of forming a minority government, believing that this offered the potential for a more collaborative and democratic approach to the work of the Assembly.

However, this was to lead to the very outcome Tony Blair had wanted to prevent, the election of Rhodri Morgan as leader of the Welsh Assembly. On 9 February 2000, after less than nine months in office, Michael resigned in an attempt to avoid a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; over the availability of Objective 1 funding from the European Union. Blair was in the House of Commons taking Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions when Michael resigned; his Parliamentary Private Secretary had not been notified of this yet, and moments later Conservative leader William Hague asked: “Will the Prime Minister comment on the fact that within moments of his expressing full confidence in the First Secretary in Wales five or 10 minutes ago, news came through to the House that the First Secretary had resigned, before the vote of confidence had taken place?“ This led to an exchange that proved humiliating for Blair as he had not been given any notice of Michael&#x27;s impending resignation. In his resignation Michael also expressed a desire to avoid a debacle resulting from his inevitable re-appointment (and potential repeated removal) arising from an inconsistency in the Assembly&#x27;s brand-new rules.

Michael sat on the Welsh Affairs Select Committee from November 2007 to May 2010 and resigned as an MP on 22 October 2012.

===Environment career===
In 2001, he was appointed Minister of State for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality, a post within DEFRA. He was the minister most closely connected with a ban on hunting with dogs, for which he attracted much criticism from hunt supporters. Michael was criticised for citing the research of Sir Patrick Bateson as &quot;incontrovertible proof&quot; of the need for a total ban. Sir Patrick said, &quot;Only somebody who was scientifically illiterate could argue that evidence from a new area of research was &#x27;incontrovertible&#x27;&quot; but Michael claimed that Bateson had misunderstood the way his work had been cited.

====Hunting Act====

In 2004, he presided over the enactment of the Hunting Act which banned hare coursing, beagling, fox hunting, mink and stag hunting in the UK from February 2005. At the time this law was being debated, and immediately after it was passed, Michael maintained his visits to rural areas despite threats and protest, but withdrew from the event to launch the &quot;Right to Roam&quot; stating that access to the countryside was too important to be interrupted by pro-hunt protestors whose plans could put the public at risk. Michael maintained that hunting was a &quot;peripheral issue&quot; citing social and economic issues in rural areas as &quot;the day job&quot;. In 2004, he formally approved the order designating the New Forest as a National Park.

====Trade and Business====
In 2005 Michael was moved to a ministerial post in the Department of Trade and Industry as Minister of State for Industry and the Regions, where he served only one year before he was returned to the backbenches in the Cabinet reshuffle of May 2006.

In 2005 the Freedom of Information Act came into force allowing members of the public to request disclosure of information from public bodies. On 18 May 2007 Alun Michael was among the majority of MPs who voted in favour of exempting MPs from having to disclose information under the act.

===Votes for 14-year-olds===
In his newspaper column in the &quot;Penarth Times&quot; of 10 May 2010, Michael proposed giving the vote to 14-year-olds as a way of improving turn-out at UK elections. He said: &quot;My first suggestion is to reduce the voting age to 14 – an age which I find young people far better informed and sensibly engaged than was the case in the past – so that everybody takes place in the voting process once before leaving full-time education. They will then know how to vote when they come to engage with political issues later in life&quot;. This was going much further than official Labour Party policy, which only promised a free vote in Parliament on reducing the voting age to 16 in their 2010 manifesto. 

==Controversies==

===Parliamentary expenses claims===
Michael was one of the MPs who was investigated by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in its probe into MPs Expenses Claims in 2009. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;Alun Michael claims £4,800 for food in one year, and £2,600 for repairs to his roof at his constituency home in Penarth. Claims for £1,250 cost of repairing a wall and building a 13ft chain link fence.&quot; Subsequently, it was reported he was among 390 MPs required by Sir Thomas Legg to repay taxpayers&#x27; money which allegedly they had wrongly-claimed. An audit of claims dating back to 2004 revealed that Michael should repay £18,889.56 for mortgage interest on additional loans &quot;not shown to have been for an eligible purpose&quot;. He had also been paid £280 more than he was entitled to claim for council tax in the year 2004/05 – claiming expenses for 12 installments when he had only had to pay 10 to the local authority. Michael blamed a &quot;clerical error&quot; for the inflated claim. He said &quot;The council tax payment came at a time when I was under a lot of stress politically&quot;. Michael repaid £19,169.56 although later in a 2010 Election Hustings meeting in Splott he said press reports of his having been forced to pay back £20,000 were &quot;untrue&quot; and asserted he had &quot;voluntarily&quot; paid back the money.

===Investigated by IPSA===
In 2011, Michael was investigated by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) over his website. IPSA found he had contravened the rules of the MPs&#x27; Expenses Scheme which prohibit MPs from claiming parliamentary expenses for websites which include party logos. Michael had claimed – and been paid – £346.71 which he was not entitled to. He was given 20 days to amend his website but was not required to pay back the money he had been paid.

==Police and Crime Commissioner==

On 18 June 2012, Michael was chosen as the Labour Party candidate for the inaugural election for Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales.

On 13 July 2012 the &quot;Western Mail&quot; reported that Michael had been &quot;interfering inappropriately&quot; in the selection process for his replacement in Cardiff South and Penarth, to ensure his preferred candidate (Stephen Doughty) was included on the shortlist. Michael responded that he did speak to Ed Miliband, to the party&#x27;s general secretary Iain McNicol and members of the National Executive Committee, with the purpose to stop a candidate from outside being imposed on the local party.

Having stood down as an MP, Michael was declared the winner of the first-ever election for Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales on 16 November 2012 (the election having taken place the previous day). The PCC elections used the supplementary vote system. In the first round Michael failed to gain an outright majority against two Independents and a Conservative candidate. In the second-round however Michael garnered 72,751 votes beating the runner-up, Independent candidate and former lawyer Michael Barker, by 11,967 votes.

In a Parliamentary written answer on 11 December 2012, Damian Green, Minister of State for Police and Criminal Justice, reported that Michael&#x27;s salary as PCC for South Wales is £85,000 per annum.

On 9 November 2017 Michael asked Carwyn Jones to define the allegations made against Carl Sargeant, the former Welsh assembly member who apparently took his own life.

On 23 May 2023, and in reference to the deaths of two boys in a collision in Cardiff, Michael said &quot;It would appear that there were rumours, and those rumours became rife, of a police chase, which wasn&#x27;t the case and I think it illustrates the speed with which rumours can run around with the activity that goes on social media nowadays, and that events can get out of hand.&quot; Later the same day this was apparently contradicted by the emergence of household CCTV footage of a police van closely following two people on an electric bike 900 metres from the crash site. In response, Jane Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said, &quot;This footage raises serious questions over the version of events provided by South Wales Police and PCC Alun Michael. We now need an immediate, impartial investigation. Should Alun Michael be found to have misled the public he should resign.&quot;

In 2023, it was announced that Michael would not contest the 2024 South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner elections. His former deputy, Emma Wools was elected following his retirement in 2024.

<doc id="414475" wikidata="Q1055918" url="?curid=414475" title="Lembit Öpik">
<text>Lembit Öpik (, ; born 2 March 1965) is a former British politician. A former member of the Liberal Democrats, he served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Montgomeryshire in Wales from 1997 until he lost his seat at the 2010 general election. He was the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats from 2001 to 2007.

Öpik stood unsuccessfully for the position of President of the party in 2004 and 2008. He was also unsuccessful in a bid to become the Liberal Democrats&#x27; nominee in the 2012 London mayoral election.

Beyond his political work, Öpik has also been in the public eye through his appearances on several television shows and as a result of his personal relationships with ITV weather presenter Siân Lloyd and with pop star Gabriela Irimia of the Cheeky Girls, which drew considerable media attention.

==Early life==
Öpik&#x27;s parents were from Estonia, but after the Soviet occupation under Joseph Stalin, they fled to Northern Ireland. Öpik was born in Bangor, County Down, the elder son of Liivi Öpik (née Vedo) and physicist Uuno Öpik (19 October 1926 – 6 May 2005), and grew up there with sister Urve Öpik (born 1960, a psychotherapist) and brother Endel &quot;Tal&quot; Öpik (12 April 1968 – 21 November 2005, a musician). His grandfather was Ernst Öpik, an Estonian astronomer who worked at Armagh Observatory.

Öpik was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution before going on to the University of Bristol, where he completed a degree in philosophy. He served as the President of the University of Bristol Union (1985–86) and as a member of the National Executive of the National Union of Students (1987–88).

In 1988, Öpik joined Procter &amp; Gamble in Newcastle upon Tyne as a brand assistant. He became corporate training and organisation development manager in 1991 and was promoted to be global human resources training manager in 1996. Öpik was elected to the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Federal Executive Committee in 1991. He was elected as a councillor on Newcastle City Council in 1992.

Öpik stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for Newcastle upon Tyne Central in the 1992 general election and for Northumbria in the 1994 European Parliament elections.

==Parliamentary and party career==

===Member of Parliament===
At the 1997 general election, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire, Alex Carlile, retired and Öpik successfully stood as the Lib Dem candidate. He retained the seat at the 2001 general election and at the 2005 general election, increasing his share of the vote by 3.5% in 2001 and by a further 1.8% in 2005, giving him a majority of 7,173 over the Conservative candidate. However, he lost his seat to the Conservative Glyn Davies following a 13.2% swing in Montgomeryshire at the 2010 general election.

Öpik served as the Liberal Democrat spokesman on education (1997), Northern Ireland (1997–2007), Wales (2001–07), business (2007), and housing (2007–08).

During the 2001–05 Parliament, Öpik was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons. He was the joint chair of the Middle Way Group, a cross-party parliamentary group which supported the regulation, rather than the banning, of fox hunting.

===Welsh party leadership===
Öpik became leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats in 2001 following the retirement of Richard Livsey. He stood down in 2007 and was succeeded by Mike German.

===Campaigns for party presidency===
In September 2004, Öpik stood for the position of President of the Liberal Democrats but was defeated by Simon Hughes. The party president chairs a number of party committees and also represents the party at official functions.

In 2008, a campaign amongst grassroots party members backing him as a successor to Hughes, under the slogan &quot;I Pick Öpik&quot;, emerged at the party&#x27;s 2008 spring conference in Liverpool. On 24 September, Öpik announced that he was standing down as the party&#x27;s housing spokesman to concentrate on a campaign for party president. However, in the party ballot in November, Öpik was defeated by Baroness Scott of Needham Market by 20,736 votes to 6,247.

===Support for party leadership candidates===
In successive Liberal Democrat leadership contests, Öpik gained a reputation for backing campaigns that soon collapsed, leading some to talk of the &quot;curse of Lembit&quot; making his backing undesirable. In 1999, he was one of only two of the party&#x27;s 46 MPs to back the abortive leadership campaign of Don Foster. Foster abandoned his campaign before nominations even closed, and backed Charles Kennedy, the eventual winner, instead.

During the 2006 leadership contest, Öpik was initially a strong supporter of Kennedy, who then stood down. Öpik subsequently became campaign manager for Mark Oaten. However, Oaten quickly withdrew from the contest, having failed to attract enough support from within the parliamentary party; his only backers were Öpik and Baroness Ludford. In the 2007 leadership election, Öpik declared his backing for Nick Clegg, and when Clegg won the election Öpik said &quot;My man won, so the curse of Öpik has at last become a blessing&quot;.

Öpik supported Jenny Randerson in the 2008 contest for leadership of the Welsh Liberal Democrats. Randerson lost to Kirsty Williams. Öpik supported Tim Farron in the 2015 Liberal Democrat leadership election, who eventually won with a margin of 13%.

===Expenses row and criticism===
In May 2009 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published details of Öpik&#x27;s parliamentary expenses claims. It showed that in 2008–2009 he claimed £23,083 in second home allowances out of public funds, including various items of furniture and a £40 summons charge for non-payment of Council Tax. Öpik told &quot;The Telegraph&quot; &quot;I am willing to pay back the £40&quot; but did not offer to repay anything else. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; also outlined a rejected expense claim he had attempted to make for £2,499 for a plasma screen television, after which he bought one costing £750.

==2010 and beyond==
Öpik lost his seat in parliament at the 2010 general election when he was defeated in his constituency of Montgomeryshire by Glyn Davies of the Conservative Party by 13,976 votes to 12,792. This represented a swing of 12.5% against Öpik and a swing of 13.8% in favour of the Conservatives in the constituency. Öpik put himself forward to be the Liberal Democrats&#x27; nominee for mayor of London in the 2012 mayoral election, but in the first round of the party&#x27;s selection ballot, he came fourth with 252 votes and was eliminated from the process.

Öpik was a candidate for the Liberal Democrats&#x27; federal executive committee in 2012 but was not elected. He also expressed an interest in becoming the Liberal Democrats&#x27; candidate for the position of Police and crime commissioner for Northumbria Police in 2012. However, he was ruled ineligible because he did not have a residence in the region.

Late in 2012, he joined Leadenhall Consulting, a human resources consulting firm specialising in the insurance and financial sectors, as an associate director responsible for developing training. On joining the firm, Opik explained that training is his &quot;first love&quot;. Öpik is a long-time supporter of the Motorcycle Action Group (MAG UK) and a keen motorcyclist. On 23 November 2013, it was announced that Öpik had joined MAG as director of communications and public affairs. In the post, he will work on behalf of motorcyclists in the UK and Europe.

He presents programmes on BBC Radio Kent every Friday morning from 9:00 where he hosts the topical Kent Midmorning phone-in, and every Sunday from 11:00 where he presents a news panel format, digesting the week&#x27;s local, national and international stories, looking at the newspapers, welcoming expert guests and politicians for discussions as well as taking calls from listeners. He also regularly stands in for Julia George on other weekday mornings. Since 2010, he has broadcast for Press TV, including hosting a news satire show and a number of political news programmes. He currently hosts &quot;A Simple Question&quot;.

On 24 June 2018, Öpik was elected as the chairman of the self-proclaimed and unrecognised parliament of the micronation Asgardia during the first parliamentary session in Vienna, Austria. &quot;The birth of the new space nation Asgardia&quot; was announced in a press conference in Paris, France, on 12 October 2016 Öpik was elected for a second term as &quot;Chair of Asgardian Parliament&quot; on 25 August 2023.

In the autumn of 2018, Öpik considered participating in Estonian elections. He said he had been asked to consider being either a member of the Estonian parliament, or to consider running as president. &quot;One position is just to be a member of parliament, which I would not mind doing&quot;, he said. &quot;The other position is president of Estonia. It is more than just a non-executive role—I could make quite a big splash. I have not got a campaign plan but I have said I would be interested. It&#x27;s not an appointed job, I would have to stand for it.&quot;

In 2021, Öpik was reported to have been expelled from the Liberal Democrats following his appearance at a Conservative Party meeting as the sole speaker in an event called &quot;How to Stop the Lib Dems, an insiders guide on how the Lib Dems plan their campaigns.&quot;

In September 2022 he was announced as an upcoming speaker at the 2022 UKIP conference. and addressed the conference on &quot;wokeness&quot; in October.

==Journalism and media appearances==
===Public appearances===
Öpik has appeared several times on the BBC satirical current affairs quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, including an appearance on the day after he lost his parliamentary seat. He has also appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;Any Questions?&quot; Away from politics, he has also appeared on &quot;Stand Up for the Week&quot;, &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot;, &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;, &quot;Loose Women&quot;, &quot;Bargain Hunt Famous Finds&quot;, &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; and &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

In June 2010, he made his debut as a comedian at the Backstage Comedy Club in London&#x27;s West End. It was described by one audience member as &quot;not fantastic, but not completely awful&quot;.

Öpik also gained media attention for his part in a music video by unsigned band The Good Suns. The video featured the politician dancing and miming lyrics to their debut song &quot;Pop Wound&quot;.

In March 2012, Öpik began collaborating with rock band Adam and the Asbos on their action/adventure sci-fi film &quot;Adam and the Asbos: The Movie&quot;. In April and May 2012, he made appearances in a professional wrestling promotion, appearing from the audience to confront wrestler Kade Callous for cheating; Öpik was in turn challenged to appear in a later tag team match, which ended with Öpik &quot;black and blue&quot;.

In August 2016, Öpik performed in the comedy &quot;Rocking Your Vote&quot;, in which he played himself. The play, performed for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, starred 2015 parliamentary candidate for West Bromwich Will Goodhand.

Since 2021, Öpik has been a contributor to &quot;GB News&quot;.

===Writings and journalism===
In 2009 Lembit Öpik published an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; named &quot;We need a cosmic plan&quot; about risks of asteroid impact on Earth. Earlier, in 1999, he called on the government to invest between £500,000 and £1m annually in tracking asteroids to avert catastrophe. He wrote a column in the (now defunct) &quot;Daily Sport&quot; newspaper earning him up to £5,000 a year.

With Hilary Bird and Ulvi Mustmaa, he is the author of the &quot;Xenophobe&#x27;s Guide to the Estonians&quot;, published by Oval Books in June 2010. In March 2012, Öpik released his first collaborative work with Edward Joyce, &quot;The Alternative View&quot;, a book discussing the future of the Liberal Democrats in the UK, including a call for the then party leader Nick Clegg to step down as Leader of The Liberal Democrats, but to remain deputy prime minister in the coalition government. The book&#x27;s cover pays tribute to The Orange Book, although Öpik has often been considered a member of the &#x27;social liberal&#x27;, left wing of the party. His book &quot;All at Sea&quot;, a tale about a curious cruise, was published in 2015.

==Personal life and charity work==

Lembit Öpik is the son of atomic physicist Uuno Öpik and the grandson of astronomer Ernst Öpik. He speaks fluent English, Estonian and German. Talking about the 2004 Parliamentary Language Challenge, he said that he could &quot;get by&quot; in French and Welsh and was intending to become fluent in the Welsh language. In 2003 he was a &quot;day president&quot; at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, held at Meifod within his constituency; this required him to make a speech in Welsh, for which he was coached by his then girlfriend, Siân Lloyd.

On 13 April 1998 Öpik came close to death in a paragliding accident. He fell onto a Welsh mountain in his constituency and broke his back in 12 places, as well as his ribs, sternum and jaw. This experience caused him to take a keen interest in the Spinal Injuries Association, of which he is a member. He later underwent a series of surgical procedures to correct the damage to the bones in his face.

Despite the accident, he continued with his interest in aviation. He talked about the accident to the July 2010 edition of Flaps Podcast, where he recounted his accident and its aftermath. He has since become a glider pilot at the Midland Gliding Club in Shropshire. He holds a pilot&#x27;s licence and spoke for British gliding in the House of Commons.

Öpik also rides motorcycles (he was the chair of the all-party parliamentary motorcycling group when he was an MP), and since November 2013, he has been employed as the campaigns and communications director for the Motorcycle Action Group. Öpik supports the English football club Leicester City. His mother lives in the city of Leicester.

He participated in a celebrity edition of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; to raise money for charity. &quot;Sport Relief Does The Apprentice&quot; was part of Sport Relief, the Comic Relief/BBC charity initiative that aired on 12 and 14 March 2008. In 2006 he became president of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, following his father&#x27;s death from the disease the previous year.

He and ITV weather presenter Siân Lloyd appeared on &quot;Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; on 15 April 2006, winning £64,000 for the Motor Neurone Disease Association and Action for Children. The couple came close to marrying, but she ended the relationship in October 2006 and made unflattering comments about Öpik in her autobiography, &quot;A Funny Kind of Love&quot;. According to Lynn Barber, the author&#x27;s &quot;main purpose seems to have been demolishing love-rat Lembit&quot;.

Öpik later became involved with then-24-year-old Gabriela Irimia of pop music double-act The Cheeky Girls. They split up in July 2008 after a &quot;difficult period&quot; in the relationship.

At the age of 52 he had a daughter, born in June 2017, with his partner Sabina Vankova. Later that year his partner was reported to have left him. The couple had a second daughter in November 2020.

<text>George Samuel Knatchbull Young, Baron Young of Cookham, (born 16 July 1941), known as Sir George Young, 6th Baronet from 1960 to 2015, is a British Conservative Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 2015, having represented Ealing Acton from 1974 to 1997 and North West Hampshire from 1997. He has served in Cabinet on three occasions: as Secretary of State for Transport from 1995 to 1997; as the Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal from 2010 to 2012; and as Conservative Chief Whip from 2012 to 2014.

He stood down from the Commons at the 2015 election and was created a life peer, as Baron Young of Cookham, &quot;of Cookham in the Royal County of Berkshire&quot;, on 29 September 2015. He sits on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords, where he served as a junior whip from July 2016 to August 2019. Young resigned from this position on 29 August in protest at Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s decision to prorogue parliament. He served as a minister under five Conservative prime ministers (Margaret Thatcher, John Major, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson).

==Early life==
Young was born in Oxford in 1941 into a prominent English family, the elder son of Sir George Peregrine &quot;Gerry&quot; Young, 5th Baronet and Elisabeth Knatchbull-Hugessen. His paternal ancestors and cousins include Admiral Sir George Young, an admiral in the Royal Navy and father of the first Baronet; civil servant Sir William Mackworth Young; colonial governors Sir Hubert Winthrop Young and Sir Mark Aitchison Young; mountaineer Geoffrey Winthrop Young, and Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet. Sir Brian Young (1922–2017), director-general of the Independent Television Authority, was his cousin.

Young&#x27;s father was a diplomat who met Elisabeth while serving in Beijing (where her father, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, was British Ambassador). He had saved his future wife&#x27;s life during an aerial shooting attack in 1937. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1960, George succeeded to the baronetcy created in 1813. Young is a great-great-grandson of Frederick Lygon, 6th Earl Beauchamp.

==Education and early career==
Young was educated at St. Aubyns Preparatory School in Rottingdean, Eton College, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 1963 (and later proceeding to MA). He was active in student politics while at Oxford, holding various offices in the Oxford University Conservative Association and being elected to the Standing Committee of the Oxford Union.

After graduating, he worked for a while at the merchant bank Hill Samuel, and then at the National Economic Development Office from 1966 to 1967. He then spent two years as Kobler Research Fellow at the University of Surrey, where he completed an MPhil. From 1969 to 1974, Young was an economic advisor to the Post Office Corporation.

==Career in local politics==
Young was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Lambeth from 1968 to 1971 together with his wife and also the future British Prime Minister John Major. He represented the ward of Clapham Town, and served on the Housing Committee. He and other Lambeth councillors worked as refuse collectors at weekends during a strike. Young lost his seat on Lambeth Council in 1971.

In 1970, Young was elected to the Greater London Council (GLC) as one of four members for the Ealing. He served on the GLC from 1970 to 1973, where he was vice-chairman of the Strategic Planning Authority. He did not seek re-election to the GLC in 1973, having been selected as the Conservative candidate for the Acton constituency. He was later one of the local government ministers who abolished the GLC in 1986.

==Parliamentary career==

===Member of Parliament===
Young was elected to parliament at the February 1974 general election as MP for Acton with a majority of 1,300, defeating the sitting Labour Party MP, Nigel Spearing (who was returned to Parliament a few weeks later after winning a by-election in Newham South). Young was re-elected as MP for Acton at the October 1974 general election with a majority of 808. He continued to represent Acton (renamed Ealing Acton in 1983) for the next 23 years, until the seat was abolished in boundary changes. He was selected for the safe Conservative seat of North West Hampshire prior to the 1997 general election to replace the retiring MP Sir David Mitchell (the father of Andrew Mitchell whom Young would, in 2012, succeed as Chief Whip). Young was elected with a majority of 11,551, and served as the MP for North West Hampshire until his retirement in 2015.

====Posts====
From 1976 to 1979 Young served as an opposition whip. When the Conservative Party won the 1979 general election, he was appointed Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Health and Social Security. From 1981 to 1986, Young served as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the department for the Environment.

On the backbenches from 1986 to 1990, Young was among the leaders of the rebellion within the Conservative Party against the implementation of the poll tax. Shortly before leaving office in 1990, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher brought Young back into government as a whip (Comptroller of the Household) as part of her attempts to reunite the party.

When John Major became prime minister in November 1990, he gave Young the role of Minister for Housing and Planning. Shortly after, during an interview for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme in June 1991, Young described the homeless as &quot;the people you step over when you come out of the opera&quot;. In 1992 when asked during parliamentary discussions of the Armley Asbestos Disaster for financial assistance in surveying local housing in the Armley area for residual asbestos, Young responded that the government would not provide financial assistance to the home owners or the council to pay for decontamination as this &quot;would not be a justifiable use of public funds&quot;.

Young then served as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1994 to 1995, and in Cabinet as Secretary of State for Transport from 1995 to 1997. He was appointed a privy counsellor in 1993. Following the Conservative Party&#x27;s defeat in 1997, Young was appointed Shadow Defence Secretary by the new party leader, William Hague. In 1998, Young became Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. In 1999, he was given additional responsibilities as Spokesman for Constitutional Affairs. He was a member of the Modernisation Select Committee and of the House of Commons Commission from 1998 to 2000.

Young resigned from the Shadow cabinet in September 2000 in order to stand for election as Speaker of the House of Commons. Fourteen MPs put their names forward to succeed the retiring Betty Boothroyd, and many observers considered Young to be the favourite. He had support from both the Conservative and Labour leadership; however, many backbench MPs, particularly those from the Labour Party (who held a large majority in the House at the time), viewed Young as someone who had too recently been a member of his party&#x27;s front bench team and was thus not sufficiently in touch with ordinary MPs. In the end, Young was not elected as Speaker, the members of the House choosing instead Labour MP Michael Martin.

From 2000 to 2009, Young remained on the backbenches. He was elected chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges in 2001, and was re-elected to that role in 2005.

Young stood again for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons in 2009, finishing second in the ballot of MPs to fellow Conservative MP John Bercow. In the first ever secret ballot of MPs to choose the new Speaker, Bercow defeated Young in the final round of voting by a margin of 322 to 271.

On 8 September 2009, Conservative party leader David Cameron appointed Young to the front bench again, taking up his former role of Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, replacing Alan Duncan who had held the post since January 2009. He became Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal on 12 May 2010 after the Conservative Party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats following the 2010 general election. In this role, he attended Cabinet meetings, but not as a full member.

Young left government in the reshuffle of September 2012, and David Cameron recommended his appointment as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. However, his return to the backbenches was short-lived, as following Andrew Mitchell&#x27;s resignation as Chief Whip the following month, Cameron chose Young to replace him.

Young is Patron of the Tory Reform Group and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cycling.
In October 2012 it was reported that Young supported a new group of Conservative MPs established to reconnect the Tories with working class voters. The Blue Collar Conservatism group aims to develop policies to attract &quot;aspirational&quot; voters on average incomes whose support is &quot;vital&quot; to winning a Commons majority.

On 29 November 2013 Young announced he would stand down as an MP at the 2015 general election. He again retired from the cabinet at the 2014 reshuffle, replaced as Chief Whip by Michael Gove. Gove described Young as &#x27;distinguished&#x27; and &#x27;honourable&#x27;.

====Tower block housing====
Young was a vocal critic of tower block housing, saying in 1974: &quot;Nearly all local authorities have now stopped building this type of accommodation, as it is generally recognized they provide an inadequate environment for those who have to live in them. But it is no consolation to the many thousands who will have to live on these estates for the foreseeable future to know that the mistake will not recur.&quot; One measure proposed by Young was to make grants and subsidies available to minimize &quot;some of the disadvantages of living on estates containing tower blocks.&quot; He described tower block housing as &quot;an economic and social disaster&quot; and said he would &quot;like an assurance that loan sanction would not be given for any more.&quot;

====Domestic violence====
In February 1975 Young was appointed to the newly formed select committee on Violence in the Family. The committee&#x27;s terms of reference were &quot;To consider the extent, nature and causes of the problems of families where there is violence between the partners or where children suffer non-accidental injury: and to make recommendations.&quot; The committee issued an interim report in September 1975 and was instrumental in setting up several government research reports into domestic violence. In 1976 he sponsored the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill which allowed victims of rape to remain anonymous.

====Cycling====
In 1982 Young and his children appeared on a British Rail poster alongside Jimmy Savile to promote new measures to allow people to take their bicycles on trains more easily. Young had made a critical speech in Parliament about the provisions for cyclists to take their bikes on trains, and when British Rail implemented new measures they invited Young to appear on the publicity poster. An ever-enthusiastic cyclist, the British media nicknamed Young the &quot;Bicycling Baronet&quot;.

===House of Lords===

Young was created a life peer as Baron Young of Cookham, of Cookham in the County of Berkshire, on 29 September 2015. He sits on the Conservative benches of the House of Lords.

In July 2016, he was appointed as Lord in Waiting (i.e. government whip). In September 2016, he was named to serve as Treasury spokesman in the House of Lords. On 29 August 2019, Young resigned as a whip in the House of Lords in protest at Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s decision to suspend parliament.

==Personal and family life==
Young succeeded as 6th baronet in 1960 and married Aurelia Nemon-Stuart, daughter of the sculptor Oscar Nemon, at Oxford in 1964. 
They have four children: Sophia (b. 23 May 1965), George (b. 11 October 1966), Hugo Patrick (b. 23 September 1970) and Camilla (b. 1975). His elder son, the Hon. George &quot;Gerry&quot; Young, is heir apparent to the family baronetcy. The family grew up in Cookham, attending Holy Trinity Primary School in Cookham and Furze Platt secondary school in Maidenhead.

Lord Young supports the west London football club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) and has served as a churchwarden and a member of a diocesan synod in the Church of England.

<doc id="414482" wikidata="Q1689150" url="?curid=414482" title="Jim McCrery">
<text>James Otis McCrery III (born September 18, 1949) is an American lawyer, politician and lobbyist who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1988 to 2009. He represented the 4th District of Louisiana, based in the northwestern quadrant of the state.

McCrery was a ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee. Had the Republicans maintained control of the U.S. House in 2007, he would have been in line to chair the Ways and Means Committee. Instead, the slot went to the veteran Democrat Charles Rangel of Harlem in New York City. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group of Moderate Republicans.

McCrery did not seek reelection in 2008 and was succeeded as Representative by John C. Fleming, a fellow Republican.

==Early life and career==
McCrery was born in Shreveport and reared in Leesville, the seat of Vernon Parish in western Louisiana. He graduated in 1967 from Leesville High School. In 1971, McCrery earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in both English and history from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston in Lincoln Parish. Thereafter in 1975, he obtained a degree from the Louisiana State University Paul M. Hebert Law Center in Baton Rouge. McCrery joined the law firm of Jackson, Smith &amp; Ford in Leesville, where he worked from 1975 to 1978.

From January through August 1979, he was a staff member of U.S. Representative Buddy Leach, a Leesville native. McCrery resigned from Rep. Leach&#x27;s staff in August 1979 to join the staff of the Shreveport City Attorney&#x27;s office. After Leach was unseated in 1980 by Buddy Roemer of Bossier City, McCrery was hired as district manager and later legislative director for Representative Roemer. In 1984, McCrery returned to Louisiana to work for Georgia Pacific Corporation, a forest products company. He remained there until his election to Congress four years later.

==Congressional career==
After Roemer resigned from Congress to become governor, McCrery ran for his former boss&#x27;s seat as a Republican.

In 1992, Louisiana lost a district as a result of sluggish population growth during the 1980s. Also, the state was ordered, temporarily, to draw a second black-majority district by the Justice Department. The legislature responded by shifting most of Shreveport and Bossier City&#x27;s black voters into a new 4th District that stretched in roughly a &quot;Z&quot; shape all the way to Baton Rouge. Most of McCrery&#x27;s former territory was merged with the 5th District, represented by 16-year incumbent Democrat Jerry Huckaby, who is now retired in Lincoln Parish. On paper, McCrery was in serious danger, since Huckaby retained nearly all of his former territory. However, the new Fifth was significantly more urbanized than its predecessor because of the presence of Shreveport. McCrery retained 55 percent of his former constituents. Also, since the new 4th had absorbed most of the old 5th&#x27;s blacks as well, the new 5th District was only 16 percent African American; the old 5th was 30 percent black. McCrery was thus such a heavy favorite that national Democratic leaders wrote off the seat as a loss and urged Huckaby to retire. Huckaby chose to stay in the race and was heavily defeated, carrying only one parish in the district. McCrery thus became the first Louisiana Republican to unseat a Democratic incumbent at the federal level.

McCrery was reelected seven more times with no substantive opposition and was completely unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2004. His district was renumbered as the 4th again in 1997, after the United States Supreme Court ruled the 4th was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

In the mid-term election of 2006, McCrery defeated Democratic challengers Patti Cox and Artis Cash and Republican Chester T. &quot;Catfish&quot; Kelley.

From 2007 to 2009, McCrery was the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee.

In 2007, in the early stages of the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination for 2008, McCrery announced his endorsement of candidate Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts for the party&#x27;s nomination, a designation Romney won in 2012, not 2008.

On December 7, 2007, McCrery announced his decision not to seek reelection in 2008. Closed primaries were held by both parties in the fall of 2008 to begin the process of choosing a successor to McCrery. In the Republican primary, physician John C. Fleming of Minden in Webster Parish, beat McCrery&#x27;s preferred successor, Jeff R. Thompson, a Bossier City attorney.

==Subcommittees and laws==
Congressman McCrery sat on the following House Ways and Means subcommittees:
* Health Select Revenue Measures (Chairman)
* Human Resources
* Social Security (chairman)

McCrery sponsored or cosponsored six public bills in the 109th Congress that have been signed into law by the president, all of which involved disaster mitigation and assistance in response to 2005 hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.

==Post-Congressional career==
In January 2009, McCrery joined a top lobbying firm, Capitol Counsel in Washington, D.C.
He is the lead Republican in the company. Among his clients is General Electric.

==Family and personal life==
On August 3, 1991, McCrery married the former Mary Johnette Hawkins (born December 1966), a Republican, a former television newswoman and communications specialist from Shreveport. The couple has two sons, Scott and Otis McCrery. The McCrerys subsequently divorced.

McCrery is a United Methodist.

In August 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal, who once worked as a summer intern on McCrery&#x27;s congressional staff, appointed McCrery to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of John George, a Shreveport physician, to the influential Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors.

==Political controversies==

===Chinese vice-premier gaffe===
During the China–U.S trade talks of March 2007, McCrery and New York Democrat Charles Rangel committed a gaffe when they accidentally insulted Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi by referring to her as the Vice Premier of the &quot;Republic of China&quot; in a letter. The Republic of China is a name for the self-ruling government on the island of Taiwan, which the PRC considers a rogue province.

<doc id="414485" wikidata="Q337590" url="?curid=414485" title="Alan Williams (Swansea West MP)">
<text>Alan John Williams (14 October 1930 – 21 December 2014) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Swansea West for over 45 years, from 1964 to 2010. He was the longest serving MP for a Welsh constituency since David Lloyd George and built a reputation for his detailed scrutiny of the ways in which public money was spent.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Caerphilly, the son of Emlyn, a former miner who became a local government officer, and Violet (née Ross). He was educated at Cardiff High School for Boys (a state grammar school) then Cardiff College of Technology and Commerce when he gained a BSc in economics in 1954 (awarded by the University of London). At University College, Oxford, he studied PPE. He became an economics lecturer at the Welsh College of Advanced Technology then a broadcaster and journalist.

==Member of Parliament for Swansea West==
He unsuccessfully contested Poole in 1959, coming second to Conservative incumbent Richard Pilkington. Shortly afterwards he was selected as the candidate for Swansea West, which the Conservatives had won by a narrow majority of 403 votes.

The constituency, containing the city centre, the university and the relatively prosperous western suburbs, had historically been a marginal one for Labour, in contrast to the more working-class Swansea East. Percy Morris, elected in the Labour landslide of 1945, had seen his majority cut to just over a thousand votes in 1955 before the Conservative Hugh Rees unseated him four years later. Williams recaptured the seat in 1964, and held it for nearly 46 years. However, it was never entirely safe, and Rees tried unsuccessfully to recapture the seat in 1966 and 1970.

Williams had a very tight contest at the 1979 election, in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and divisions in Welsh Labour over devolution. He held on by only 401 votes, only two fewer than the Tory majority he had overturned in 1964. His majorities thereafter were more secure but the fact that the Liberal Democrats came close to winning the seat after his retirement in 2010 suggests that he had a substantial personal vote.

==Parliamentary career==
Williams served under Prime Minister Harold Wilson as Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs from 1967 until 1969 and then as a Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Technology until 1970, when Labour lost power and Conservative leader Edward Heath replaced Wilson as prime minister. When Labour were returned to power at the February 1974 general election, Williams was made Minister of State at the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, serving until Wilson left office in 1976. The new prime minister, James Callaghan, then appointed him as Minister of State at the Department of Industry in which post he served until Labour lost power to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives in the 1979 general election.

Williams was made a Privy Counsellor in 1977. He was a backbencher from 1989 to 2010, and chairman of the Liaison Committee from 2001 to 2010. He was a Eurosceptic and was opposed to the devolution settlement that established the National Assembly for Wales.

In 2003, he abstained on the parliamentary approval for the invasion of Iraq.

===Father of the House===
Following the retirement of Tam Dalyell at the 2005 general election, Williams became the MP with the longest continuous service in the House, earning him the title of Father of the House.

He was the last MP to question Prime Minister Tony Blair at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 27 June 2007. He congratulated Blair for giving the Labour Party ten years of government, called him one of the outstanding prime ministers of his time, and thanked him for making the Labour Party once again the &quot;natural party of government&quot;.

Williams was the last parliamentary survivor of those who were elected in Wilson&#x27;s 1964 election win. As Father of the House, Williams presided over the Commons Speaker election on 22 June 2009, in which MPs chose John Bercow as Speaker. He stood down from the Commons at the 2010 general election.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Patricia Rees, who used her middle name in everyday life, in June 1957 in Bedwellty. They had two sons and a daughter, Sian.

==Death==
He died at the age of 84 on 21 December 2014. He was in a nursing home in London after having a stroke six months prior to his death.

Previously he was the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2013. First elected as a Democrat, he changed parties in 2004 to run as a Republican and was re-elected five times.

==Background==
Alexander was born in the village of Bienville in Bienville Parish to the former Mary Crawford and James Earl Alexander. In 1964, he graduated from Jonesboro-Hodge High School in Jonesboro in Jackson Parish, which is often cited as his hometown. He then attended Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, but he left college to work for his family construction company.

Alexander left the police jury to represent District 13 in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1988 until his election to Congress in 2002. While in the state House, he served as the chairman of the House Health and Welfare Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2002
Alexander won his seat in 2002 as a Democrat, but ran in 2004 as a Republican, changing parties on 6 August 2004, only three months before the election and only 30 minutes before the filing deadline. The move was derided by Democrats Robert Matsui and Mary Landrieu as being &quot;cowardly&quot;.

;2004
On August 4, 2004, he registered to run as a Democrat, but changed his registration to Republican two days later. He then defeated a fellow Republican, the late Jock Scott of Alexandria in the open primary that November. In 2006, he defeated the Democrat Gloria Williams Hearn, wife of the psychologist George E. Hearn of Pineville, Louisiana. His party switch became official on August 9, 2004.

;2010

Alexander defeated Richard Todd Slavant of Monroe in the Republican closed primary by a margin of nearly 9–1. He faced Independent Tom Gibbs, Jr., of Ouachita Parish in the November 2 general election and won easily. No Democratic candidate had filed for the position, once held by such long-serving party members as Jerry Huckaby and Otto Passman. During this election, he joined the Tea Party Caucus.

;2012
Alexander drew two last-minute challengers in his successful 2012 bid for a sixth term in the U.S. House. Alexander handily prevailed with 202,531 votes (77.8 percent). The Libertarian Clay Steven Grant received 20,194 votes (7.8 percent), and the No-Party candidate, Ron Caesar, polled 37,486 votes (14.4 percent).

During the 2012 election Alexander&#x27;s campaign raised a total of $1,235,114. $942,083 were spent leaving the campaign with a surplus of $295,079 and no debt. Major contributors to Alexander&#x27;s campaign came from a variety of business interests including the crop production industry, the oil and gas industry, commercial banks, and general contractors. Top individual contributors include Adams and Reese, the Livingston Group, O&#x27;Neal Gas, and Kadav Inc.

His speeches include &quot;Party of Paychecks&quot; in which he speaks on the nations food-stamp necessity increase and speaks against &quot;out-of-control government spending&quot; and unemployment. Many of Alexander&#x27;s other speeches include warning against tax increases and supporting religious freedom and public prayer.

Alexander&#x27;s voting record shows a history of voting against tax law amendments on a variety of matters. He has also voted &quot;Nay&quot; on many extensions for relief or aid, regulations, and has voted &quot;Yay&quot; to prohibition of tax increase. In 2012, he voted for several pro-business, anti-environmental bills such as the Stop the War on Coal Act and the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act.

<doc id="414488" wikidata="Q12899736" url="?curid=414488" title="Teddy Taylor">
<text>Sir Edward MacMillan Taylor (18 April 1937 – 20 September 2017), known as Teddy Taylor, was a British Conservative Party politician who was a Member of Parliament (MP) for forty years, from 1964 to 1979 for Glasgow Cathcart and from 1980 to 2005 for Southend East.

He professed Euroscepticism all his life and was a leading member and vice-president of the Conservative Monday Club.

==Early life and career==
Taylor was born in Glasgow. After being educated at the High School of Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, which he attended with future Labour leader John Smith, he worked as a journalist on the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; and served on Glasgow City Council from 1960. He fought Glasgow Springburn at the 1959 general election, but he lost to Labour&#x27;s John Forman.

==Parliamentary career==
He first entered Parliament in the 1964 election as MP for Glasgow Cathcart, following John Henderson&#x27;s retirement. At the time he was the Baby of the House, as at 27 he was the youngest MP, although not for long as Liberal David Steel entered Parliament five months later at the age of 26. Having served as an opposition MP until 1970, he became a Scottish Office minister in Prime Minister Edward Heath&#x27;s government. He resigned from this position in July 1971 in protest at the UK joining the European Economic Community, which Heath enthusiastically supported. Because of his strong personal following, he held on to the working-class constituency of Glasgow Cathcart, one of only two Conservative seats in Glasgow in the 1970s, the other being the more affluent Glasgow Hillhead.

As Opposition Front Bench Spokesman on Scottish Affairs, Taylor said in November 1974 that a general directive to the National Coal Board should follow the guidelines of the Social Contract in any wage settlement. He called the Harold Wilson-led Labour government &quot;thoroughly cowardly and hypocritical over the Social Contract&quot; and asked the government spokesman in the House of Commons whether it was &quot;just a sick joke&quot;. He was politically close to Margaret Thatcher and served in her shadow cabinet, as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland.

Whilst he was Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, the Conservatives stood on a policy staunchly against Scottish devolution. Although Taylor strongly agreed with this, he knew and warned Thatcher that by standing on a platform against devolution, which Labour were promising at the next election, that moderate SNP voters who favoured devolution but not necessarily independence would switch to Labour, hence endangering Taylor&#x27;s marginal seat, which he had held by 1,757 votes in October 1974. He was expected to become Thatcher&#x27;s Secretary of State for Scotland if he had held his seat at the 1979 election. Twenty years later, during a Commons debate on devolution in 1999 at the prelude of the Scottish Parliament, he said: &quot;Unfortunately, as I warned Lady Thatcher, making the SNP vote disappear meant that the then Member of Parliament for Glasgow, Cathcart had to disappear as well. However, it was a good bargain for Scotland to get rid of the SNP and devolution, even if it meant that I had to go as well.&quot; In any case, he was back in Parliament within a year of his defeat, although he would never serve in government.

===Monday Club===
He was a leading and early (pre-1966) young member of the old Conservative Monday Club, and was on the platform at the Club&#x27;s very successful rally at the Scottish Conservative Party&#x27;s annual conference at Perth on 17 May 1968. He was first co-opted onto the Club&#x27;s Executive Council on 9 September 1968. He is listed in a Club circular as one of its members standing for Parliament in the General Election on 9 June 1983, for Southend East, and was elected deputy Chairman of the Club on 23 June that year. He consistently opposed the EEC and the EU and campaigned for the UK to leave. He was a leading campaigner against joining the euro and had also campaigned against metrication. Throughout his career he fought hard for the interests of British fishermen.

Taylor sought leave to introduce a bill in parliament in October 1974 to restore capital punishment. The following January, referring to the murder of a London policeman by a Provisional Irish Republican Army gunman, he said that &quot;the answer was return of capital punishment&quot; and added that &quot;if the police want arms, no government could now refuse&quot;. He was on the editorial board that prepared the Club&#x27;s October 1985 Conservative Party Conference issue of their newspaper, &quot;Right Ahead&quot;, to which he contributed a lengthy article entitled &quot;How Tories Are Subsidising the Soviet War Machine.&quot; In the mid-1980s he said, &quot;Nelson Mandela should be shot.&quot; On 30 March 1990, he was the guest speaker at the Club&#x27;s Surrey branch 21st Anniversary Dinner and was still a Vice-President in 1992. He was guest-of-honour at the South East Essex Monday Club&#x27;s Annual Dinner on 4 July 1997.

===Change of seats===
At the 1979 election, Scotland bucked the British trend by showing a slight swing from Conservative to Labour, and Taylor lost his seat, the only Conservative MP at that election (other than by-election victors) to do so. He had been widely expected to become the Secretary of State for Scotland. Taylor re-entered Parliament at a 1980 by-election for Southend East following the death of Stephen McAdden and, from the 1997 general election, represented Rochford and Southend East. He did not serve in government after his return but received a knighthood in 1991.

Prior to being selected to fight the Southend by-election, Taylor had been a candidate for the Rectorship of the University of Dundee. He was a favourite to win but pulled out of the election at the last minute to contest the parliamentary seat.

During John Major&#x27;s government, he was one of the Maastricht Rebels and was temporarily expelled from the parliamentary party, although he was later reinstated. Taylor stood down at the 2005 general election.

==Later life==
Taylor was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project. Taylor campaigned for a &#x27;leave&#x27; vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

In 1996 the US industrial metal band Ministry released the album &quot;Filth Pig&quot;, which derives its name from Taylor describing the band&#x27;s singer Al Jourgensen as a &quot;filthy pig&quot; in the Houses of Parliament.

==Personal life and death==
In 1970, Taylor married Sheila Duncan, and they had three children.

Taylor was a fan of Bob Marley.

Taylor&#x27;s health declined at the end of his life due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was a heavy smoker. He died from complications of pneumonia and septicaemia at Southend University Hospital on 20 September 2017, at the age of 80.

<text>The University of Alabama System is a public university system in Alabama that coordinates and oversees three research universities: University of Alabama (UA), University of Alabama at Birmingham, and University of Alabama in Huntsville. These universities enroll more than 70,000 students. The system employs more than 45,000 employees at its three campuses and health system making it one of the largest employers in the state. The System is known to heavily favor the Tuscaloosa University over the other two.

==Campuses==
The University of Alabama was founded in 1831 in Tuscaloosa and is the state of Alabama&#x27;s oldest public university. In 1936, UA established an extension center in Birmingham, and the University of Alabama School of Medicine moved there in the same year. In 1950, another extension center was set up in Huntsville.

In 1966, the Birmingham extension center and the School of Medicine merged as the University of Alabama in Birmingham. However, it was still treated as an offsite department of the main campus in Tuscaloosa. With the creation of the UA system in 1969, UAB became a fully autonomous institution, and the Huntsville extension center also became an autonomous four-year campus as the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

;Notes:
===The University of Alabama===
Founded in 1831 and located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, The University of Alabama (also known as Alabama, or colloquially as &#x27;Bama) was established by constitutional provision under statutory mandates and authorizations. Its mission is to advance the intellectual and social condition of the people of the state through quality programs of teaching, research and service. Within Alabama, it is often called the Capstone and UA. Outside the state, it is well known for its athletic teams being nicknamed the &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (crimson is the primary color of the state flag of Alabama and one of the school colors).

===University of Alabama at Birmingham===

The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a public research university covering 83 blocks in Alabama&#x27;s largest city Birmingham. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. UAB is a vital economic engine of the state of Alabama with an estimated $7.15 billion annual impact. UAB is currently the state&#x27;s largest employer with more than 24,000 faculty and staff and over 64,000 jobs at the university and in the health system. Almost 10% of the jobs in the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Area are related to UAB.

===University of Alabama in Huntsville===
The University of Alabama in Huntsville (also known as UAH) is located in Huntsville, Alabama and it was founded in 1950. UAH is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctorates. This university is organized into five colleges: business, engineering, the liberal arts, nursing, and the sciences.

UAH is known for its programs in engineering and the physical sciences, such as geophysics (the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere) and the physics of interplanetary space. UAH is a Space Grant university, and it has a history of cooperation with both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (See: Marshall Space Flight Center) and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command. The National Space Science and Technology Center is on the campus of UAH.

==Governance==
The Board of Trustees executes its governance responsibilities through a chancellor, who serves as the chief executive officer of the System. A president heads each campus with responsibility for campus administration and reports directly to the Chancellor and through the Chancellor to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees and the Chancellor delegate certain administrative functions and maintain such offices as deemed appropriate to meet the administrative needs of the System. The Chancellor also provides linkage between the System and various components of state and federal governments, as well as other educational groups and organizations.

===Board of trustees===
The Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama is a self-nominating board composed of 15 elected members and one ex officio member. The makeup of the board is dictated by the Constitution of the State of Alabama which requires that the board be made up of three members from the congressional district that contains the Tuscaloosa campus and two members from every other congressional district in Alabama. The Governor of Alabama is a member of the board by virtue of the office. Elected board members are nominated by the board and are confirmed by the Alabama State Senate. Board members may serve three consecutive six-year terms.

<doc id="414491" wikidata="Q332843" url="?curid=414491" title="Ann Taylor, Baroness Taylor of Bolton">
<text>Winifred Ann Taylor, Baroness Taylor of Bolton, (born 2 July 1947) is a British politician and life peer who served in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2001. A member of the Labour Party, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton West from 1974 to 1983, and Dewsbury from 1987 to 2005.

==Early life and education==
Winifred Ann Taylor (nee Walker) was born on 2 July 1947 in London. Her mother, Doreen Bowling, was born in Lancashire and her father and grandfather hailed from Motherwell, Scotland. Her father was a Post Office engineer and Labour Party councillor in Bolton, and her grandfather served as chairman of Motherwell Labour Party.

Taylor was educated at Bolton School, where she was head girl. She studied at the University of Bradford, where she graduated with a BSc in Politics and History in 1969.

==Political career==
Taylor contested the marginal Bolton West constituency at the February 1974 general election, but lost to incumbent Conservative Robert Redmond by a majority of 603 votes. However, she was elected to represent the same constituency in October 1974, defeating Redmond with a majority of 903.

During her first term in Parliament, she served in the Callaghan government as an assistant whip from 1977 to 1979. Notably the first female whip in the UK Parliament, she was later depicted in the 2012 play &quot;This House&quot;.

Re-elected at the 1979 general election with a reduced majority of 600 votes, she unsuccessfully contested the new Bolton North East seat in 1983, defeated by Conservative Peter Thurnham. Taylor returned to Parliament upon her election to the Dewsbury constituency at the 1987 general election, representing the seat until her retirement in 2005.

When she returned to the House of Commons in 1987, Taylor became a shadow minister under Labour leader Neil Kinnock; covering education and science from 1979 to 1981 and the environment from 1981 to 1992. She then served in the Shadow Cabinets of John Smith and Tony Blair as Shadow Secretary of State for Education from 1992 to 1994, Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1994 to 1995 and Shadow Leader of the House of Commons from 1994 to 1997.

In the first Blair ministry, Taylor became the first woman to serve as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Privy Council in 1997. After a 1998 cabinet reshuffle, she went on to become the first woman to serve as Government Chief Whip (Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury).

As a backbencher, Taylor served as chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee from 2001 to 2005. Her appointment to this post was criticised by opposition Liberal Democrats. She also sponsored a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, the &#x27;Succession to the Crown (no 2)&#x27; Bill, which sought to eliminate gender and religious discrimination in the royal succession.

On 13 May 2005 it was announced that Taylor was to be given a life peerage, and she was created Baroness Taylor of Bolton, &quot;of Bolton in the County of Greater Manchester&quot;, on 13 June 2005. She was made Minister for Defence Procurement on 7 November 2007, following Lord Drayson&#x27;s decision to resign to compete in the American Le Mans Series; unlike her predecessor, she was paid. Following the Brown reshuffle of October 2008, she was moved to a new post at both the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as Minister for International Defence and Security.

In September 2022 she became a member of the House of Lords Appointments Commission, filling the quota for the Labour Party.

In January 2024 she became Chair of the Industry and Regulators Committee, where she had been a member since 2022.

<doc id="414493" wikidata="Q727361" url="?curid=414493" title="Richard Baker (American politician)">
<text>Richard Hugh Baker (born May 22, 1948) is an American politician and lobbyist. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2008, representing the 6th District of Louisiana as a Republican.

==Early life and career==
The son of a Methodist minister, Baker was born in New Orleans and graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He stayed in Baton Rouge after graduation and founded a real estate agency there. In 1971, just a year out of school, he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives as a Democrat from a predominantly blue-collar district in Baton Rouge and served eight terms. He became chairman of the Transportation Committee.

==Congressional career==
In 1986, Baker switched to the Republicans because of a long-running feud with Governor Edwin Edwards. Soon afterwards, 6th District Republican congressman Henson Moore, announced that he was running for the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Russell B. Long. (Moore was defeated in that race by 7th District Democratic congressman John Breaux). Moore encouraged Baker to run for the seat, which is based in Baton Rouge and includes most of that city&#x27;s suburbs. Baker (51 percent) defeated Democrats Thomas H. Hudson (45 percent) and Willis Blackwell, Sr.(4 percent). He became the fourth Republican to represent Louisiana in Congress since Reconstruction and the second to win an undisputed victory in a contested election. He was reelected without opposition in 1988 and 1990. Baker quickly compiled a standard Republican voting record, in marked contrast to his Democratic roots, as evidenced by Baker&#x27;s lifetime rating of 0.5 from Americans for Democratic Action, a progressive think tank.

In 1992, however, Louisiana lost a congressional seat as a result of reapportionment after the 1990 Census. Clyde C. Holloway of Forest Hill in Rapides Parish, who had represented the Alexandria-based 8th District, was placed into Baker&#x27;s district. Holloway had been elected along with Baker in 1986. Holloway led in the jungle primary with 37 percent. Baker received 33 percent and Democrat Ned Randolph, then the mayor of Alexandria, received 30 percent. In the November general election, Holloway won 15 of the district&#x27;s 17 parishes. Baker, however, crushed Holloway in the two largest parishes, Livingston Parish and his home base, East Baton Rouge Parish. This was enough to defeat Holloway by some 2,700 votes overall.

After being unopposed in 1994 and 1996, in 1998 Baker faced Marjorie McKeithen, daughter of longtime Republican Louisiana secretary of state W. Fox McKeithen and granddaughter of Democratic former governor John McKeithen. Court-ordered redistricting before the 1996 elections had drawn considerably more blacks into the district than Baker had previously represented. Amid a nationwide backlash against Republicans for what was seen as overzealous behavior during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Baker just barely held onto his seat by about one thousand votes, narrowly avoiding a runoff. He had a much easier time in 2000, winning 68 percent of the vote. Redistricting took some Democratic voters out of his district, including part of Pointe Coupee Parish, which helped Baker win against no major-party opposition in 2002 and two weak Democrats in 2004. In 2006, his only challenger was Libertarian Richard M. Fontanesi, and Baker won with 82 percent of the vote.

Baker was a former chairman of the House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee, and served as its ranking Republican from 2007 to 2008. He was also a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and United States House Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs.

===Hurricane Katrina===
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Baker caused some controversy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when he was overheard telling lobbyists: &quot;We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn&#x27;t do it, but God did.&quot; Baker, a longtime critic of the Housing Authority of New Orleans and the living conditions in New Orleans public housing, confirmed the quote and explained that his comment reflected his hope that the storm will provide an opportunity to move New Orleans&#x27;s poor from decrepit public housing and into clean and safe housing.

In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Baker proposed a plan to rebuild Louisiana. Commonly known as &quot;The Baker Plan,&quot; Baker introduced legislation to create the Louisiana Recovery Corporation. The LRC would have been initially financed by the issuance of federal government bonds and would use the funds to buy properties from homeowners and business in the most devastated areas of the state. The LRC would then clean the property and sell clean titles to developers, who would then redevelop the properties in accordance with plans developed by the local governments and civic groups. The proceeds of the sales to the developers would have been used to repay the bonds used to initial finance the LRC, paying the government back for their initial loan. The homeowners would have had the option to accept the buyout and walk away, accept the buyout and retain an option to return, or refuse to sell and repair their property themselves. On the advice of Recovery Tsar Donald E. Powell, President Bush killed the LRC when he publicly announced his opposition to the bill.

===Resignation===
On January 15, 2008, Baker announced his intention to resign from Congress to take a lobbying position with the Managed Funds Association. He left office on February 2, 2008. This triggered a special election, won by Democrat Don Cazayoux, who defeated Republican and former Democrat Woody Jenkins. Cazayoux was defeated in the regular election later in 2008 by Republican Bill Cassidy, who later became the state&#x27;s senior U.S. senator.

<text>Gavin Steel Strang (born 10 July 1943) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh East from 1970 until 2010 (including two terms for Edinburgh East and Musselburgh). He served as a minister in the 1974–79 Labour government under Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, as well as in the Cabinet under Tony Blair. By the time of his retirement at the 2010 general election, he was the longest-serving Scottish MP.

==Early life==
A farmer&#x27;s son, Strang grew up in Perthshire and attended the independent Morrison&#x27;s Academy in Crieff. After gaining a BSc in Genetics from the University of Edinburgh in 1964, he gained a Diploma in Agricultural Science from Churchill College, Cambridge and a PhD in Agricultural Science from Edinburgh, presenting the thesis &quot;The genetic aspects of litter productivity in British pigs&quot;. From 1966 to 1968, he was a member of the Tayside Economic Planning Consultative Group and, from 1968 to 1970, was a scientist at the Agricultural and Food Research Council and Animal Breeding Research Organisation in Edinburgh.

==Parliamentary career==
Strang was first elected in the 1970 general election after Labour MP George Willis, who had represented Edinburgh East since a 1954 by-election, retired. Strang was a minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, serving as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Energy in 1974 and then at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food until 1979. In 1990, he was the last person to ask Margaret Thatcher a question at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, which he used to criticise her impact on communities and the poor during her time in office.

Following the 1997 general election, Strang was made Minister of State for Transport with a seat in the Cabinet. However, he was sacked in June 1998. After becoming a backbencher, he was sometimes critical of government policy. He campaigned against the privatisation of National Air Traffic Services, and on 31 October 2006, was one of twelve Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War. From 1997 to the 2005 general election, his seat was named Edinburgh East and Musselburgh.

Strang was a member of the Tribune Group of MPs and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. He was Chairman of the All-Party Group for World Government and served on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. In November 2007, he announced he would stand down at the next general election, but later reversed the decision. On 27 June 2008, Strang again changed his mind, and announced that he would indeed stand down at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Strang married Bettina in 1973. They have a son, and he has two step sons. His wife has been the chair of the arm of the advocacy organisation Europa Donna. Bettina died in 2016.

<doc id="414498" wikidata="Q389109" url="?curid=414498" title="John Stanley (Tonbridge and Malling MP)">
<text>Sir John Paul Stanley (born 19 January 1942) is a British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tonbridge and Malling from 1974 to 2015.

==Education==

Stanley was educated at two independent schools: at Copthorne Preparatory School near Crawley in West Sussex and Repton School in the village of Repton in Derbyshire, followed by Lincoln College at the University of Oxford, where he read Modern History. He also studied at Syracuse University.

==Early career==
Stanley was at the Institute for Strategic Studies from 1968 to 1969. He worked for Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Ltd (RTZ) from 1969 to 1979. He is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

==Parliamentary career==
Stanley contested the Newton seat in 1970. He was first elected to Parliament at the February 1974 election, prior to which he had worked for the Conservative Research Department as an advisor on housing policy. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher from 1976 to 1979, during her time as Leader of the Opposition.

He was made Minister of State with responsibility for housing at the Department of the Environment following the Conservative victory at the 1979 general election. Four years later he was moved to become Minister of State for the Armed Forces in the Ministry of Defence. Following the 1987 general election Stanley was moved to the Northern Ireland Office, once again as Minister of State, but left the government front bench in 1988 and remained on the back benches thereafter. He was mainly interested in defence and foreign policy, having sat on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee from 1992 onwards. 

He was re-adopted as the Conservative party candidate for his constituency in 2008 for the 2010 general election. In March 2012, Stanley announced that he would stand down at the next general election.

In May 2014, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Stanley had received fees worth thousands of pounds for consultancy work for one of the big City investors who were granted priority access to shares in Royal Mail plc, which the Coalition government had decided to privatise.

In July 2023, declassified UK government documents from the period after the September 11 2001 attacks in the USA showed that Stanley had warned the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, that there was a high risk of terrorist attacks in the UK, possibly even using a &#x27;dirty bomb&#x27; or other acquired weapon of mass destruction. Stanley urged Blair to strengthen domestic UK security and improve civil defence preparedness.

==Personal life==
He married Susan Giles on 21 December 1968 in the City of London; they later divorced. The couple had two sons and one daughter.

==Honours==
* He was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council on 16 June 1984. This was announced in the 1984 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List. This gave him the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for Life.
* He was knighted on 13 December 1988. This allowed him to be referred to as &quot;Sir John Stanley&quot;.

<text>Christopher Charles John (born January 5, 1960) is an American politician and lobbyist who from 1997 to 2005 served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana&#x27;s 7th congressional district, since disbanded and merged into the 3rd district.

==Early life==

Chris John was born in Crowley in Acadia Parish, one of six children, and reared as a Roman Catholic. He is of Lebanese, French, and German extraction. He attended Notre Dame Catholic High School in Crowley and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He was a page while his father, John N. John, III, was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. In the early 1980s, he was elected to the Crowley City Council.

==Terms in Congress: Representative, and run for Senate==
In 1996, John was elected to Congress. He defeated fellow Democrat Hunter Lundy in a runoff for the 7th district seat. In 2004, John surrendered his House seat to run for the seat in the U.S. Senate being vacated by popular Democrat and fellow Crowley native John Breaux, who endorsed him.

John, however, was defeated by Republican David Vitter of the New Orleans suburbs in the primary, Vitter garnered 51 percent of the vote, compared to 29 percent for John. The remainder of the ballots was split between then State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy and the African-American then-state senator Arthur Morrell, both Democrats. John&#x27;s seat in the House fell into Republican hands, as Charles Boustany won the 7th district with 55 percent of the vote against Democrat Willie Landry Mount. Kennedy later switched parties and succeeded Vitter as senator in 2017.

==Post-political career==
John is married to Payton Smith of Leesville, whose father, John R. Smith, is a member of the Louisiana State Senate and a former state House member. The Johns have two sons, who are twins. After his House career ended, John worked for two years as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Since August 2007, he has made his home in Lafayette, where he is chief lobbyist for the United States Oil and Gas Association. (&quot;Morning Advocate&quot;).

In 2009, John was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

==Electoral history==

*No vote totals were recorded in 1998. Section 511 of Title 18 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, as amended, provides that a candidate who is unopposed is declared elected by the people and his/her name shall not appear on the ballot in either the Primary or General Election.

<doc id="414504" wikidata="Q1175443" url="?curid=414504" title="David Maclean, Baron Blencathra">
<text>David John Maclean, Baron Blencathra, (born 16 May 1953) is a Conservative Party life peer. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Penrith and The Border from 1983 to 2010.

==Early and later life==
Born in Scotland, Maclean was educated at Fortrose Academy, Fortrose, and at the University of Aberdeen.

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully contesting Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber at the 1983 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election seven weeks later, following the ennoblement of William Whitelaw. He took his seat when the House returned from summer recess in October.

In Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government, Maclean served as a government whip from 1987 to 1989, when he was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, retaining the position when John Major took over as Prime Minister in 1990.

Following the 1992 general election, he was promoted to Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, and in 1993, he was moved to the post of Minister of State at the Home Office, a position he held until the Conservative Party&#x27;s defeat at the 1997 general election. He turned down an offer to join the Cabinet, probably as Minister for Agriculture, in 1995, stating that he was &#x27;a round peg in a round hole&#x27;.

Under William Hague&#x27;s leadership in opposition, he returned to the backbenches until 2001, when the new leader Iain Duncan Smith promoted him to opposition Chief Whip. When Duncan Smith lost a vote of confidence in 2003, Maclean tendered his resignation but was reappointed to the position under new leader Michael Howard. He returned to the back benches when David Cameron was elected as leader in 2005.

During the 2005 general election and since, he has worked extensively with the pro hunting group Vote-OK, with the aim of returning a Conservative Government in order to have the Hunting Act 2004 repealed.

Maclean made the headlines in 2007, when he proposed a private members bill that would have exempted the Houses of Parliament from the Freedom of Information Act. The bill proved controversial, with the government unofficially supporting the bill.

Maclean said that &quot;My bill is necessary to give an absolute guarantee that the correspondence of members of parliament, on behalf of our constituents and others, to a public authority remains confidential.&quot; The Bill was passed by the House of Commons on 18 May 2007, but has so far failed to find a sponsor in the House of Lords.

A report by the House of Lords &quot;Select Committee on the Constitution&quot;, published on 20 June 2007, said the Bill &quot;does not meet the requirements of caution and proportionality in enacting legislation of constitutional importance.&quot;

In its report the Constitutional Affairs Committee in the Commons said &quot;we have been sent no evidence indicating a need for such an exemption or that existing protections for constituents&#x27; correspondence were inadequate.&quot; Gordon Brown&#x27;s green paper on constitutional reform, &#x27;The Governance of Britain&#x27;, says &quot;It is right that Parliament should be covered by the Act&quot;, indicating that the Bill&#x27;s main proposal will not become law.

On 26 June 2009, Maclean told his constituency Conservative Association that he would not stand at the following election, because of worsening multiple sclerosis.

===Expenses claims===

Maclean was reported in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as having spent more than £20,000 improving his farmhouse under the Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) scheme before selling it for £750,000. He claimed the money by designating the property as his &quot;second home&quot; with the Commons authorities, yet Maclean did not pay capital gains tax on the sale because the taxman accepted it was his main home.

Maclean was one of 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.

==House of Lords==
On 28 February 2011, Maclean was created a life peer, as Baron Blencathra, &quot;of Penrith in the County of Cumbria&quot;, and he was introduced in the House of Lords on 10 March 2011, where he sits as a Conservative. In 2010, Maclean was played by Sam Graham, in the television film &quot;On Expenses&quot;. Four years later he was found to have breached the Code of Conduct of the Lords in his dealings with the government of the Cayman Islands.

Lord Blencathra returned to the frontbenches for the first time in 19 years on 1 September 2024 as Shadow Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

== Personal life ==
In 2003, at the age of 49, Maclean revealed he had been living with multiple sclerosis for the previous five years.

<doc id="414506" wikidata="Q4757838" url="?curid=414506" title="Andrew MacKay (British politician)">
<text>Andrew James MacKay (born 27 August 1949) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Stechford from 1977 to 1979, East Berkshire from 1983 to 1997 and for Bracknell in Berkshire from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
MacKay attended Solihull School, an independent school in Solihull, West Midlands. After leaving school he chaired the Solihull Young Conservatives. He has worked as a car salesman, estate agent and company director. 

==Parliamentary career==
MacKay first entered parliament in 1977, after taking Birmingham Stechford from Labour at the Birmingham Stechford by-election. He lost the seat at the 1979 general election, but re-entered parliament in 1983 as MP for East Berkshire. He was deputy Chief Whip under John Major, and was Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1997 to September 2001 during the leadership of William Hague. He was on the backbenches subsequently, but was appointed a Conservative Deputy Chairman in September 2004 with responsibility for candidates, and, after David Cameron&#x27;s election in November 2005 as Leader of the Conservative Party, MacKay became a Senior Parliamentary/Political Adviser to the new Conservative leader.

===Expenses claims===

MacKay and his wife (and fellow MP) Julie Kirkbride own two homes: one in her constituency; and a flat close to Parliament in Westminster. In a case of so-called &quot;double-dipping,&quot; according to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, MacKay had used his Additional Costs Allowance to claim more than £1,000 a month in mortgage interest payments on their joint Westminster flat. His wife used her Additional Costs Allowance to claim over £900 a month on paying off the mortgage for their family home near her constituency. This means they effectively had no main home but two second homes – and were using public funds to pay for both of them. During 2008–9, MacKay claimed a total of £23,083 under Additional Costs Allowance, while Kirkbride claimed £22,575. They also claimed for each other&#x27;s travel costs, with Kirkbride claiming £1,392 to meet spouse travel, while MacKay claimed £408. On 14 May 2009, he resigned from his position as parliamentary aide to Cameron in the wake of the furore over Parliamentary expenses after what was described as an &quot;unacceptable&quot; expenses claim.

At a public meeting in his constituency on 22 May he had been heckled, and called a &quot;thieving toad&quot; according to &quot;The Independent&quot;.

In an interview with Matthew Amroliwala on BBC News the following morning, MacKay apologised for his error of judgement. In what he claimed was an agreed procedure with the Parliamentary Claims office, he had designated their Westminster home as his secondary home, while Kirkbride has designated the Bromsgrove house as her second home. MacKay announced that the procedure had been ongoing for eight or nine years, and that he would be repaying the monies after taking advice from the Conservatives scrutiny committee.

On 23 May 2009, after a telephone call from Cameron, it was announced that MacKay would stand down at the 2010 general election.

==Personal life==
In 1974 MacKay married Diana Joy Kinchin; they had two children, but divorced in 1996. The following year, MacKay married Julie Kirkbride, a fellow Conservative MP; the couple have a son who attended Westminster School.

<text>Michael Nicholson Lord, Baron Framlingham (born 17 October 1938) is a British politician, and was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich between 1997 and 2010. He was first elected for the predecessor seat of Central Suffolk in 1983.

He was the Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, one of the Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons, from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
He attended Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he gained an MA in agriculture in 1962 and a blue for rugby union as a centre. He also played club rugby for Bedford. He is a former president of the Arboricultural Association.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested Manchester Gorton in 1979 and was first elected as an MP for Central Suffolk in 1983.

He was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons from 1997, and therefore did not take political stances or vote in the Chamber. Before his position, he was a eurosceptic who was one of the Maastricht Rebels. He was knighted in the 2001 Birthday Honours.

He stood down as an MP at the 2010 general election. On 19 November 2010, it was announced that he would be created a life peer and sit as a Conservative in the House of Lords. Created on 14 January 2011 and introduced into the House of Lords on 18 January 2011, he took the title Baron Framlingham, of Eye in the County of Suffolk. Though life peers usually use their surname in their title, Framlingham was advised he could not become &quot;Lord Lord&quot;; though this nickname has since been used occasionally in jest.

==Personal life==
He married Jennifer Margaret Childs in 1965 and they have a son, Tim Lord, and a daughter.

<text>Sir Gregory Knight (born 4 April 1949) is a British politician, author and musician. He served as the Conservative MP for East Yorkshire from 2001 to 2024, having previously served as the MP for Derby North from 1983 to 1997. He also served as a minister in the governments of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron.

==Education and professional life==

Born in Blaby, Leicestershire, Knight was educated at Alderman Newton&#x27;s Grammar School, Leicester, and the College of Law Guildford, qualifying as a solicitor in 1973.

==Political career==

Knight served as a Leicester City Councillor for Castle Ward and Leicestershire County Councillor for Evington Division from 1976 to 1981.

He was MP for Derby North from 1983 until the 1997 election, when he lost his seat. He returned to the House of Commons in 2001 after successfully contesting the East Yorkshire seat.

As a backbencher, in the 1980s, he succeeded in amending licensing law in England and Wales by doubling &#x27;drinking up time&#x27; on licensed premises from ten to twenty minutes, a concession that was welcomed by the industry and drinkers alike. However the 2003 Licensing Act ended standard permitted hours and provides for an unspecified drinking up time determined by the licensee&#x27;s discretion.

He is in favour of bringing back capital punishment and spoke out against the apartheid government of South Africa during the 1980s.

He was deputy Chief Whip under John Major between 1993 and 1996 and Minister of State for Industry at the Department of Trade and Industry from 1996 until the Conservative defeat at the 1997 election. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1995, entitling him to the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;.

He served under Michael Howard as a shadow minister for Environment and Transport until 2005. In the 2005–10 Parliament, he was chairman of the House of Commons Procedure Committee and on four other House of Commons select committees: the Liaison Committee, Administration Committee, the Committee on Modernisation of the House and the Standards and Privileges Committee. He was re-elected unopposed to the chair of the Procedure Committee in 2010.

In 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Knight had claimed £2,600 in expenses for &quot;driveway repairs&quot; at his constituency home, though Knight stated that his cars were kept separately and paid for out of his own pocket.

Knight has successfully piloted two of his Private Members Bills into law. In 2011, he was successful in taking through Parliament the Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011, a bill to make the distribution of estates fairer.

He rejoined the government in September 2012 as a senior whip and Vice Chamberlain of the Royal Household, a position he held until October 2013.

Knight is a Eurosceptic and is in favour of Brexit.

In 2018, he introduced his second Private Member&#x27;s Bill, the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill, which mandates the Government to introduce a statutory code of practice for the operators of private car parks, to require transparency and good practice to ensure that motorists are not treated unreasonably. The bill was passed by Parliament and became an Act in March 2019.

Knight has argued in Parliament for &quot;double summertime&quot;, which would see the clocks go forward by two hours during summer.

He is Secretary of the British American Parliamentary Group, one of the largest and most active all-party groups at Westminster.
An avid motorist, he is critical of initiatives seen as &#x27;anti-car&#x27;, such as congestion charging, pedestrianisation schemes, speed humps and some &#x27;park and ride&#x27; proposals. He is chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Historic Vehicles Group and successfully called on the Government to exempt historic vehicles from MOT tests.

In 2011, he was shortlisted as the &#x27;Industry Champion of the Year&#x27; by the International Historic Motoring Awards, for his work in supporting the historic and classic car movement.

Knight announced in June 2023 that he would stand down at the 2024 general election.

==Personal life==
He plays the drums and is a founder member of MP4—the world&#x27;s only parliamentary rock group. The others are fellow former MPs Kevin Brennan and Ian Cawsey and Peter Wishart MP. Whilst he was a Leicester councillor, he co-wrote and played on &quot;It&#x27;s a Leicester Fiesta&quot; (1979).

He has backed several other artists on the drums in live shows including George McCrae and Fergal Sharkey and, in the studio, he played drums backing KT Tunstall, Steve Harley, Ricky Wilson and David Gray on the charity single &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; released in December 2016 by Chrysalis Records.

==Honours==
* In 1995, he was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* In October 2013, he was awarded a Knighthood for political service. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;Sir&quot; for life.

<text>Olivier Jean Denis Marie Panis (; born 2 September 1966) is a French former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Panis won the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix with Ligier.

Panis competed in Formula One for Ligier, Prost, BAR and Toyota, winning the in with the former, amongst five podiums. Panis moved into sportscar racing after Formula One, and is a race-winner in the FFSA GT Championship and the Le Mans Series. He competed in four editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing fifth in and with Oreca.

==Early and personal life==

Olivier Jean Denis Marie Panis was born on 2 September 1966 in Oullins, Lyon. Panis started his career in karting.

Panis is the father of racing driver Aurélien Panis.

==Career==

After graduating from karts, Olivier raced several years in a number of junior series, including before French Formula 3. He won a championship in Formula Renault in 1989 and finished second in French Formula 3 in 1991. He eventually found himself in Formula 3000, and he won the series&#x27; championship there in 1993.

===Formula One===

The 27-year-old Panis earned an F1 drive in 1994 for the French-based Ligier team. He made his debut at Brazil, finishing eleventh. He earned a surprise second place that season at Hockenheim ahead of teammate Éric Bernard, and finished 11th in the standings for the marque. He finished every race except France. He was however disqualified in Portugal for illegal skid block wear.

He earned another surprise second place at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, in spite of being two laps behind the leader Damon Hill, and he also added a handful of fourths to his resume, giving him an 8th-place finish in the championship.

Panis took a shock win in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix. Starting 14th on a wet track, Panis passed other rivals on the narrow circuit, including Martin Brundle, Mika Häkkinen and Johnny Herbert, and timed his change onto slick tyres perfectly. He overtook Eddie Irvine at the Lowes Hairpin and was running in third place before the Williams-Renault of Damon Hill and Benetton-Renault of Jean Alesi both hit terminal technical difficulties. One of only three to finish the race, British drivers David Coulthard and Johnny Herbert being the other two, Panis held off a late charge from Coulthard to win. The race finished on 75 of the 78 scheduled laps due to the two-hour time limit being reached. Panis&#x27; victory was the Ligier team&#x27;s first victory in 15 years (and their last), and it was the first French victory in a French car at Monaco in 66 years. However, it was the only highlight to his season, and he otherwise failed to do any better than 5th place in Hungary.

Panis had the potential for a big season in while driving for Alain Prost, who had purchased Ligier. On Bridgestone tyres, he took the tyre company&#x27;s first podium at Brazil. He was running second in Argentina before retirement. After 6 races, he stood third in the championship thanks to another podium finish with second place in Spain. A win could have been possible in that race had he not been held up lapping backmarkers for seven laps, losing him a total of 6 seconds to leader Jacques Villeneuve. At the 1997 Canadian Grand Prix, he broke both legs in a high-speed accident, causing him to miss the next seven races of the season. His place in the team was taken by Jarno Trulli, until he returned for the final three races of the season. He achieved sixth place at Luxembourg and appeared to show that he had fully recovered from his accident, as he drove as well as he had done before the crash. Despite missing half of the year, he still managed 9th in the championship with 16 points.

1998 would prove to be a difficult season for Panis. He failed to score a single point for the Prost team, primarily due to a poor quality car. However, his full potential was restricted by the pins which remained in his legs, a legacy of the surgery following his crash in 1997. The highlight of the season was a ninth-place finish in Australia, although he also ran strongly at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix until car failure intervened. An indicator of the team&#x27;s problems in 1998 was the solitary point scored by Panis&#x27; team-mate Jarno Trulli at Spa-Francorchamps.

The following year saw an improvement for the partnership. A stronger car, and unusual circumstances, saw an irregular return to form for the Frenchman. After a troubled race he still claimed 6th in Brazil, a feat he repeated at Hockenheim. He began to qualify much more strongly, with a third place in France, fifth at the Nurburgring, and sixth at Suzuka, where he spent the first stages of the race in third. Despite the signs of a return to form in 1999, strategical errors and misfortune restricted his points tally. Irrespective of the improvements, Panis ended his relationship with the Prost team.

Panis was a consideration to drive for Williams, a team that was in a state of flux at the time, but turned it down to test for McLaren. This helped showcase Panis to other top teams in F1, where he would regularly match the testing times of regular drivers David Coulthard and double World Champion Mika Häkkinen. He was rumoured to replace David Coulthard for the 2000 Spanish Grand Prix after his plane crash, however Coulthard was cleared to race. Due to this he landed a drive with BAR for 2001. BAR wasn&#x27;t the top team he had hoped, and he finished in 14th place during both of the years he was there, scoring a total of 8 points. His highest finish for BAR was in Brazil with fourth position. He had been fourth at his debut race for the team in Australia but was penalised for a yellow flag infringement which added twenty five seconds to his race time and put him seventh, and enabled Kimi Räikkönen to score a debut point.

Panis left for Toyota&#x27;s racing team in 2003. He was signed to drive and provide the second-year team his knowledge, as well as help his new Brazilian teammate, Cristiano da Matta, learn the ropes of F1. Early results were an improvement, in part because he handled the new one-lap qualifying well, but the end result wasn&#x27;t much different from previous seasons, as he was 15th with 6 points.

Panis remained with Toyota for 2004, his tenth season in Formula One. In early October 2004 he announced his intention to retire from racing following the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix; he planned to continue at Toyota as a test driver in 2005 and 2006. Before his retirement, he was the oldest active driver in F1 at the age of 37. 2004 saw him again score only 6 points, before being replaced for Brazil by his Brazilian teammate test driver Ricardo Zonta.

He was the nominated third driver for Toyota in France in 2005, but this was the last time he participated competitively at a Grand Prix weekend. On 18 September 2006, Panis announced his complete retirement from F1 in order to race in other disciplines. His final outing as a Formula 1 test driver took place at Jerez, Spain on 14 December 2006.

Panis was highly regarded for his racecraft. He was also considered by the likes of Häkkinen, who was particularly upset when Panis left the McLaren testing team to return to full-time driving, to be one of the best test-drivers in the field.

===Sports cars===

He returned to racing in 2008 with the Oreca Courage team in the Le Mans Series. He has also worked as a consultant for the French A1 Grand Prix team and participated in the Andros Trophy ice race. He had an appearance in an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, facing the team in an ice race, where he was jokingly referred to in the intro as &#x27;France&#x27;s second-best racing driver&#x27;, presumably to Alain Prost.

In 2016 Panis formed his own sports car racing team, Panis Barthez Competition, alongside professional footballer turned racing driver Fabien Barthez. The pair entered cars in the European Le Mans Series and the Blancpain GT Series, overseen by Tech 1 Racing, before Barthez stepped down at the end of 2019. Panis Racing subsequently picked up two consecutive podiums in the LMP2 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 2020 and 2021. TDS Racing took over from Tech 1 as operational partner in 2024, a year that also saw the team strike a sponsorship deal with Marc VDS.

<text>Thomas Hodge Allen (born April 16, 1945) is an American author and former politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing , and the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2008 against Republican incumbent senator Susan Collins. Allen lost to Collins 61.5% to 38.5%.

Allen was first elected in 1996, defeating Republican incumbent James Longley, Jr. with 55 percent of votes cast to Longley&#x27;s 45 percent. Allen was re-elected five times, receiving over 55 percent of the vote each time in his district, until his defeat in his 2008 run for the U.S. Senate. After, Allen was appointed president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers and began his term on May 1, 2009. His book &quot;Dangerous Convictions: What&#x27;s Really Wrong with the U.S. Congress&quot; came out in 2013.

==Early life==

Allen was born in Portland, Maine, to Genevieve (&quot;Sukey&quot;) Lahee and Charles W. Allen. His grandfather, Neal W. Allen, was a civic leader who served as chairman (mayor) of Portland from 1925-26. He graduated from Deering High School. He went on to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, before winning a Rhodes Scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford. During this time he became friends with fellow Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton. After Oxford he went on to Harvard Law School and practiced as a lawyer.

==Early political career==
He entered the field of politics when he became a staff member for Governor Kenneth M. Curtis and later for Senator Edmund S. Muskie. Allen was elected to the city council of Portland, Maine, in 1989 and served as the city&#x27;s mayor between 1991 and 1992 before winning election to the House. Allen ran for governor in 1994, losing to Joe Brennan in the Democratic primary.

==U.S. House==

===Tenure===
Allen fought Republican efforts to weaken environmental rollbacks between 1996 and 2007. Allen called for a pay-as-you-go system that would require offsets to pay for new tax cuts and new spending while on the Budget Committee, much like the system Democrats enacted in their first 100 hours of Congressional control in the 110th Congress.

Allen has made health care, campaign finance reform, and small business his legislative priorities.

**Subcommittee on Health
**Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee

<text>Adam Paterson Ingram (born 1 February 1947) is a retired British Labour Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Kilbride, then East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, from 1987 to 2010.

==Early life==
Ingram attended Cranhill Senior Secondary School in Cranhill, Glasgow, a year below Archy Kirkwood, Baron Kirkwood of Kirkhope and is a graduate of the Open University. He became a trade union official with NALGO from 1977 to 1987 after several years working as a computer programmer/analyst from 1967 to 1977. A Justice of the Peace and former chairman of East Kilbride Constituency Labour Party, Ingram was an East Kilbride District Councillor from 1980 to 1987 and leader of the District Council from 1984 to 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
Ingram was the Labour candidate for Strathkelvin and Bearsden in 1983. After coming third in a contest won by Michael Hirst of the Conservatives, he entered the Commons following the 1987 election and during this parliamentary term acted as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Neil Kinnock. After Labour&#x27;s landslide election victory in 1997, Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed him as Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office with responsibilities including Security.

In 2001 he became Armed Forces Minister at the Ministry of Defence, a position he held until Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in 2007. He was the longest serving Defence Minister in British history and is a member of the Privy Council.

On 27 March 2009, Ingram announced that he would stand down at the next general election.

==Controversies==
Ingram applied for an interim interdict to prevent the publication of Labour turned Respect politician George Galloway&#x27;s book &quot;I&#x27;m Not the Only One&quot; (2004). Galloway wrote that Ingram &quot;played the flute in a sectarian, anti-Catholic, Protestant-supremacist Orange Order band&quot;. Ingram opinied that this was in bad faith and defamatory, although Ingram&#x27;s lawyers conceded that for a year as a teenager he had been a member of a junior Orange Lodge in Barlanark, Glasgow, and had attended three parades. The Judge, Lord Kingarth, decided to refuse an interim interdict, that the balance of the arguments favoured Galloway&#x27;s publisher, and that the phrase &quot;sectarian, anti-Catholic, Protestant-supremacist&quot; was fair comment on that organisation. Although Ingram was not and never had been a flute-player, the defending advocate observed that &quot;playing the flute carries no obvious defamatory imputation ... it is not to the discredit of anyone that he plays the flute.&quot; The judge ruled that Ingram should pay the full court costs of the hearing.

In 2009 Ingram declared outside earnings of £170,000, the most of any Scottish MP. In the same year it was shown that letters in the local press defending these earnings were forged.

In June 2010 at the public inquiry into the beating to death of Baha Mousa in custody he conceded that he had misled MPs when he was Armed Forces Minister over British troops&#x27; hooding of Iraqi prisoners. He had assured the then head of the Parliamentary joint committee on human rights, Jean Corston in June 2004, that prisoners were only hooded during transportation but had received documents in September 2003 that showed that Mousa had been hooded, on the advice of interrogation experts for nearly 24 of the 36 hours that he spent in custody.

In December 2010 he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the Standards and Privileges Committee after the Cash for Influence Scandal, but criticised for bad judgement.

==Personal life==
Ingram married Maureen McMahon in 1970.

==In popular culture==
Ingram was a prominent character in the 2010 Mo Mowlam biopic &quot;Mo&quot;, in which Gary Lewis portrayed him. Ingram called the film &quot;powerful to watch&quot;, adding that it &quot;brought home the essence of Mo&quot; and that the film had moved him to tears.

<text>Wayne Thomas Gilchrest (born April 15, 1946) is an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives representing . In 2008, Gilchrest was defeated in the Republican primary by State Senator Andy Harris. Following his departure from politics he has worked on environmental education. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. In 2019, Gilchrest became a registered Democrat.

==Early life and education==
Born in Rahway, New Jersey, Gilchrest was the fourth child of Elizabeth and Arthur Gilchrest&#x27;s six boys. After graduating high school in 1964, he joined the United States Marine Corps. His tour of duty saw action during the invasion of the Dominican Republic, and later the Vietnam War. He earned the rank of Sergeant in Vietnam where, as a platoon leader, he was wounded in the chest. Gilchrest was decorated with the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Navy Commendation Medal. He is a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Military Order of the Purple Heart.

In 1969, he received an associate&#x27;s degree from Wesley College in Dover, Delaware. He then spent a semester in Kentucky studying rural poverty in Appalachia. He went on to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Delaware State College in 1973. Since then, he has done some work towards a master&#x27;s degree at Loyola College in Baltimore.

==Career==
While teaching at Kent County High School on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Gilchrest ran against four-term 1st District Democratic incumbent Roy Dyson in 1988. Dyson was plagued by allegations of improper contributions from defense contractors, questions about his sexual orientation, and the suicide of his top staffer. Despite being badly outspent, Gilchrest lost narrowly to Dyson. He sought a rematch in 1990; this time soundly beating Dyson by 14%. In 1992, he survived a close contest against Tom McMillen, who had represented the 4th District before being drawn into the 1st District. Gilchrest won by only 3%, largely by swamping McMillen on the Eastern Shore. He wouldn&#x27;t face serious opposition again for over a decade.

Gilchrest broke ranks with his party more often than any other House member in 2007. While Democrats and Republicans were nearly tied in registration in 2006 (183,332 Democrats to 180,856 Republicans), the district had a strong tinge of social conservatism that usually favored Republicans. The 1st had a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+13, indicating that it was a strongly Republican district, and supported President Bush&#x27;s re-election with over 60% of the vote.

Gilchrest was a member of many moderate Republican groups such as the Republican Main Street Partnership, Republicans for Environmental Protection, and the Republican Majority For Choice. He was also the co-chairman of the Congressional Climate Change Caucus together with Democrat John Olver (MA-1). Gilchrest was a Republican co-sponsor of Rep. Marty Meehan&#x27;s &quot;Military Readiness Enhancement Act&quot; which would have repealed the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy. Gilchrest also spoke in favor of same-sex marriage while the Maryland Legislature was considering legalizing it, calling same-sex marriage a matter of &quot;social justice, civil rights and a more viable democracy.&quot;

In 1993, Gilchrest was the lone Republican vote in support of a bill that would have created DC Statehood. Aside from his socially liberal stance, Gilchrest has drawn attention for his stance on the Iraq War. Though he initially supported the war, Gilchrest&#x27;s support waned as the occupation became increasingly violent, expressing his support for the Iraq Study Group Report and called on setting a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. Gilchrest also joined 16 Republicans and 229 Democrats voting in favor of House Concurrent Resolution (H.CON.RES) 63, a non-binding resolution expressing disapproval for the Iraq War troop surge of 2007.

===2008 election===

Gilchrest&#x27;s moderate voting record resulted in vigorous primary challenges from Republicans who considered him a Republican in Name Only. However, none were successful until 2008. That year, State Senator Andrew Harris, State Senator E. J. Pipkin, Joe Arminio, and Robert Banks challenged Gilchrest in the 2008 Republican primary. Harris was strongly supported by the Club for Growth.

Harris defeated Gilchrest in the Republican primary, with Pipkin finishing third. After Gilchrest&#x27;s loss in the primary, he broke with his party and endorsed Queen Anne&#x27;s County State&#x27;s Attorney Frank Kratovil, the Democratic nominee, in the general election, being quoted as saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s see, the Republican Party, or my eternal soul?&quot; and &quot;Party loyalty, or integrity?&quot; when questioned. Kratovil won the election.

On September 18, 2008, Gilchrest made radio comments praising the Democratic Presidential ticket of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, causing some media outlets to claim his endorsement of the Democratic ticket. However, Gilchrest quickly clarified these comments, saying that they did not amount to an endorsement. Despite the fact that he did not officially endorse Obama, in an October 2 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, Gilchrest sharply criticized his own party and their presidential nominee, fellow Vietnam veteran John McCain. Gilchrest said that the Republican party &quot;has become more narrow, more self-serving, more centered around &#x27;I want, I want, I want.&#x27;&quot; and said that McCain &quot;recites memorized pieces of information in a narrow way, whereas Barack Obama is constantly evaluating information, using his judgment. One guy just recites what&#x27;s in front of him, and the other has initiative and reason and prudence and wisdom.&quot; Gilchrest later told WBAL-TV that he voted for Obama in the November election.

Gilchrest was ranked as the House&#x27;s most liberal Republican in 2008 (his final term) by the &quot;National Journal&quot;, placing him to the left of 8 House Democrats.

<doc id="414530" wikidata="Q609337" url="?curid=414530" title="Flag of Chechnya">
<text>The flag of Chechnya () is a rectangle with sides in the ratio 2:3 representing the Chechen Republic, a republic of Russia. The flag is composed of three horizontal bars of, from top to bottom: green, representing Islam; white; and red; superimposed on them is a narrow vertical white band at the hoist, containing the national ornament, a design of four golden scroll shapes.

This flag, introduced in 1982, is primarily used by the government of Chechnya while the pro-independence flags are commonly used by opposition forces.

==Historic flags==
From 1957 to 1978, the Soviet flag of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was based on the flag of the Russian SFSR with the addition of a blue vertical bar on the hoist side and the abbreviated name of the Republic (&quot;НГӀАССР&quot; in Chechen and Ingush, and &quot;ЧИАССР&quot; in Russian).

In 1978, these abbreviated names were replaced with the full versions: &quot;ЧЕЧЕНО-ИНГУШСКАЯ АССР&quot; in Russian, &quot;НОХЧ-ГӀАЛГӀАЙН АССР&quot; in Chechen, and &quot;НОХЧ-ГӀАЛГӀАЙ АССР&quot; in Ingush.

===1991–2000===
Several flags have been used by the supporters of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. The most common of these is the green flag with the red and white stripes. Its proportions are approximately 7:11. The color scheme is green, white, red, white, green, with the upper two-thirds of the flag in green and the remaining one third in white, red, white and green stripes of equal width, the width ratio of which is 8:1:1:1:1. Another well-known example is similar to this flag but has the country&#x27;s coat of arms incorporated into the design. Each color is meant to symbolize an aspect of the Chechen national character. Green is the color of life, red symbolizes the bloodshed in the struggle for freedom and white represents the road to a bright future. These flags were mainly used by supporters of Dzhokhar Dudayev, Aslan Maskhadov and their successors. Apart from these several other designs have been used by different factions of the independentist movement, and even single sides used different flags at the same time.
====Loyalist opposition====
The pro-Moscow opposition to Dudayev used a flag of similar design with the main difference being the inversion of the red and white stripes. It has not been used since it was replaced by the current flag of the Chechen Republic.

<doc id="414531" wikidata="Q981559" url="?curid=414531" title="Dutch Ruppersberger">
<text>Charles Albert &quot;Dutch&quot; Ruppersberger III ( ; born January 31, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as an assistant state attorney of Maryland from 1972 to 1980, a Baltimore County councilman from 1985 to 1994, and Baltimore County Executive from 1994 until 2002. He was the ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015.

He announced in January 2024 that he would retire from the United States House of Representatives at the conclusion of the 118th United States Congress.

==Early life, education and career==
Ruppersberger was born in Baltimore, the son of Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; (née Wilson) and Charles Albert &quot;Al&quot; Ruppersberger, Jr. He is of part German descent. He graduated from Baltimore City College and attended the University of Maryland, College Park, where he played lacrosse. He earned his Juris Doctor (JD) from the University of Baltimore School of Law.

Ruppersberger began his career as a Baltimore County Assistant State&#x27;s Attorney. He was soon promoted to chief of the State&#x27;s Attorney Office Investigative Division, pursuing organized crime, political corruption, and drug trafficking. He was elected to the Baltimore County Council in 1985 and again in 1989, chosen twice as council chairman. In 1994 and 1998, he was elected Baltimore County Executive.

Ruppersberger decided to run for office after a near-fatal car crash while investigating a drug trafficking case. He served as vice chairman on the board of visitors for the hospital that saved his life. He also served on the United States Naval Academy Board of Visitors.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Defense
**Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs

;Previous
*Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (Ranking Member, 113th and 114th Congresses)

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Rare Disease Caucus
* United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* U.S.-Japan Caucus
* United States–China Working Group

===Party leadership===

Ruppersberger was the first Democrat freshman to be appointed to the House Intelligence Committee. He was named to this committee because his district is home to the National Security Agency. From 2011 to 2015, he served as the committee&#x27;s ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;, the chairs and ranking members of the U.S. House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, House Speaker and House Minority Leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country&#x27;s most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.

=== Agriculture ===
In September 2019, Ruppersberger was one of nine lawmakers who signed a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue urging him to reconsider a proposed rule change that would affect the number of Americans that qualified for SNAP, noting that it would be &quot;Maryland’s most vulnerable residents, including children, seniors, and people with disabilities, who would suffer the painful consequences of unnecessary and preventable hunger.&quot;

===Operation Hero Miles===
In 2003, Ruppersberger created the national &quot;Hero Miles&quot; program to allow Americans to donate their frequent flyer miles to wounded warriors recovering at military or Veterans Administration medical centers as well as to friends and family visiting them. In 2012, he authored legislation expanding the program to enable Americans to donate their hotel reward points to military families. Both the Hero Miles and Hotels for Heroes programs are administered by Fisher House, a nonprofit organization that opens its homes to military families visiting their injured loved ones at hospitals across the country. He won a Charles Dick Medal of Merit in 2004 for this initiative, becoming the last Marylander to win this award, which was previously awarded to U.S. Representative Beverly Byron (1992), State Senator John Astle (1993), U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski (1994), U.S. Representative Roscoe Bartlett (1998) and State Delegate Peter Franchot (1999).

===Municipal finance===
Ruppersberger is an advocate of municipal finance and tax-exempt municipal bonds. In 2013, he and Representative Randy Hultgren secured the signatures of 137 other House members in a letter to congressional leaders asking that they &quot;reject any proposal to cap or eliminate the deduction on tax-exempt municipal bonds used to finance the vast majority of infrastructure projects in America&#x27;s communities.&quot; They circulated a similar letter in 2015 and formed the Municipal Finance Caucus in 2016.

===Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act===
Ruppersberger and Representative Mike Rogers co-sponsored the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, designed to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies. More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT&amp;T, IBM and Intel. Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have criticized the act for lacking civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, thereby creating a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012. It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18 by a bipartisan vote of 288–127. Of the 92 Democrats who supported the bill, many of them cited significant privacy improvements over the 2012 version.

=== Biosecurity ===
On October 19, 2017, at the Emergent Biosolutions manufacturing facility in Maryland, Ruppersberger received the Congressional Biosecurity Champion Award from the Alliance for Biosecurity, a D.C.-based public-interest organization, for &quot;his leadership and actions taken in Congress to improve U.S. national security, preparedness and response for biosecurity threats.&quot; He was one of eight members of Congress to receive the award.

=== Syria ===
After President Donald Trump launched an airstrike on Syria in April 2017, Ruppersberger expressed hope that &quot;Russia and Iran stand by the international community in condemning Assad&#x27;s use of chemical weapons and cooperate in finding an appropriate way forward&quot;, and said the U.S. needed &quot;a larger, thoughtful strategy to address the situation in Syria, including the defeat of ISIS.&quot;

In October 2019, Ruppersberger said he was concerned &quot;about the instability now in the entire Middle East, and now we&#x27;re really helping to make Russia even stronger in the Middle East&quot;, and that American troops were expressing concern and embarrassment over leaving behind the Kurds.

=== Yemeni civil war ===
In December 2018, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; reported that Ruppersberger, &quot;one of five Democrats who joined the majority of House Republicans to block debate on the war in Yemen, had met with Saudi officials and foreign agents representing them on numerous occasions&quot;.

In February 2019, Ruppersberger voted for Ro Khanna&#x27;s resolution to direct the removal of U.S. armed forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.

=== Retirement ===
Ruppersberger announced on January 26, 2024, that he would not run for reelection, thus retiring from the House at the conclusion of the 118th United States Congress. He stated that it was &quot;time to pass the torch to a younger generation of leaders and I am looking forward to spending more time with my family&quot;.

== Political positions ==
Ruppersberger has voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

==Political campaigns==

Barred from a third term as county executive, Ruppersberger opted to run for Congress in 2002 after 2nd district Congressman Bob Ehrlich ran for governor. The Maryland General Assembly significantly altered the 2nd by shifting most of its share of heavily Republican Harford County to the already Republican-leaning 1st and 6th districts, respectively based on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland. In its place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic portion of Baltimore City that had previously been in the 1st district. This made the district significantly friendlier to Democrats than its predecessor.

Before running for Congress, Ruppersberger legally changed his name so that his lifelong nickname, &quot;Dutch,&quot; could appear on the ballot. He defeated Republican nominee Helen Delich Bentley, who had represented the 2nd district from 1985 to 1995, with 55% of the vote. He has never faced another close contest and has been reelected ten times.

An August 2011 editorial by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the 2nd district&#x27;s configuration as &quot;curlicue territories strung together by impossibly delicate tendrils of land&quot; and &quot;a crazy-quilt confection drawn for the express purpose of ousting the incumbent at the time, Rep. (and later Gov.) Robert L. &quot;Bob&quot; Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, and installing C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat who still holds the job.&quot;

==Electoral history==
==Personal life==
Ruppersberger married his high school sweetheart Kay Murphy in 1971 and has two children and five grandchildren.

<text>Benjamin Louis Cardin (born October 5, 1943) is an American lawyer and former politician who served as a United States senator from Maryland from 2007 until 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the U.S. representative for from 1987 to 2007. Cardin served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1967 to 1987 and as its speaker from 1979 to 1987. Cardin has never lost an election in his entire political career.

Cardin was elected as U.S. senator to succeed Paul Sarbanes in 2006, defeating Republican Michael Steele, the lieutenant governor of Maryland. He became Maryland&#x27;s senior U.S. senator on January 3, 2017, upon Barbara Mikulski&#x27;s retirement. Cardin won reelection in 2012 and 2018, and retired on January 3, 2025.
==Early life and career==
Benjamin Louis Cardin was born in Baltimore, Maryland. The family name was originally &quot;Kardonsky&quot;, before it was changed to &quot;Cardin&quot;. Cardin&#x27;s grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. His maternal grandfather, Benjamin Green, operated a neighborhood grocery store that later turned into a wholesale food distribution company. His mother Dora was a schoolteacher and his father, Meyer Cardin, served in the Maryland House of Delegates (1935–1937) and later sat on the Baltimore City Supreme Bench (1961–1977).

Cardin and his family attended the Modern Orthodox Beth Tfiloh Congregation near their home, with which the family had been affiliated for three generations. Cardin attended Baltimore City College, graduating in 1961. In 1964, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;cum laude&quot; from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1967, graduating first in his class. Cardin was admitted to the Maryland Bar that same year, and joined the private practice of Rosen and Esterson until 1978.

==Early political career==

===Maryland House of Delegates===
While still in law school, Cardin was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in November 1966. He held the seat once held by his uncle, Maurice Cardin, who had decided to not run for re-election so that his nephew could instead pursue the seat. He was chairman of the Ways &amp; Means Committee from 1974 to 1979, then served as the 103rd Speaker of the House until he left office. At age 35, he was the youngest Speaker in Maryland history at the time. As Speaker, he was involved with reform efforts involving Maryland&#x27;s property tax system, school financing formula, and ethical standards for elected officials.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
Cardin served as one of the House impeachment managers that successfully prosecuted the case in the 1989 impeachment trial of Judge Walter Nixon.

In the House, Cardin was involved with fiscal issues, pension reform, and health care. His legislation to increase the amount individuals can store in their 401k plans and IRAs was passed in 2001. His bill to expand Medicare to include preventive benefits such as colorectal, prostate, mammogram, and osteoporosis screening was also enacted. He also authored legislation to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit for chronic illnesses; fund graduate medical education; and guarantee coverage for emergency services.

Cardin has also advocated, via proposed legislation, welfare reform. His bill to increase education and support services for foster children between ages 18 and 21 was signed into law in 1999. He authored bills to expand child support, improve the welfare-to-work program, and increase the child care tax credit.

Cardin has been commended for his work with fiscal policy. He has been honored by &quot;Worth&quot; magazine and by &quot;Treasury and Risk Management&quot; for his work protecting retirement plans and government-supported medical care for the elderly. He has also received scores of 100 percent from the League of Conservation Voters and the NAACP, indicating stances that are in favor of environmental protection and civil rights. Cardin was also one of 133 members of Congress to vote against the 2002 Iraq Resolution. In 2023, Cardin voted with a bipartisan majority to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Iraq.

=== House committee assignments ===
, Cardin served on the following House committees:
* Member of the Ways and Means Committee.
** Ranking member of the Trade Subcommittee.
** Member of the Human Resources Subcommittee.
* Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.

== U.S. Senate ==

=== Elections ===

==== 2006 ====

On April 26, 2005, Cardin announced that he would seek the U.S. Senate seat of long-standing senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), following the announcement by Sarbanes that he would not be running for re-election in 2006. On September 12, 2006, Cardin faced a challenging primary battle with other Maryland Democrats, including Allan Lichtman, Josh Rales, Dennis F. Rasmussen, and his former House colleague Kweisi Mfume. Cardin won, however, with 44 percent of the vote, compared to 40 percent for Mfume, five percent for Rales, and two percent for Rasmussen.

Cardin won election on November 7, 2006, defeating Republican challenger Michael Steele 54 percent to 44 percent.

==== 2012 ====

In the general election, he faced Republican Dan Bongino, a former United States Secret Service agent, Independent Rob Sobhani, an economist and businessman, and Libertarian Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, President of the Minaret of Freedom Institute. Cardin easily won the election, taking 56% of the vote to Bongino&#x27;s 26.3%, Sobhani&#x27;s 16.4% and Ahmad&#x27;s 1%.

==== 2018 ====

Cardin was re-elected for a third term in 2018.
==== 2024 ====
On May 1, 2023, Cardin announced that he would retire and not seek re-election in 2024.

=== Tenure ===
Cardin was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when the January 6 United States Capitol attack happened. Cardin was on the Senate chamber floor when the rioters breached the Capitol. He was &quot;ushered quickly — and I do mean quickly — away from the Capitol&quot; after Vice President Mike Pence was removed from the chambers. During the attack, while Cardin hid with other senators in a safe location, he tweeted, blaming President Donald Trump for encouraging the rioters. He called for Trump to stop the protestors so the event would end &quot;peacefully.&quot; Cardin also compared the police involvement during the attack to that seen during Black Lives Matter protests, calling it a &quot;stark contrast.&quot; After the Capitol was secure, Cardin joined Congress to certify the count. After, he said that Trump should be held accountable for the insurrection and called for Republican leaders to tell Trump that he needs to resign. Two days later, on January 8, Cardin called for the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment to remove Trump.

In 2024, Cardin advocated for the federal government to fund the reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore after it collapsed when a ship crashed into it.

He subsequently served two terms as co-chair of the commission, from 2007 to 2008, and 2011 to 2012; and also two terms as chair, from 2009 to 2010, and 2013 to 2014.

Cardin has been awarded the following foreign honor:

* Commander of the Order of the Star of Romania, Romania (June 8, 2017)

==Political positions==

On a list by &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; of the members of Congress who were most supportive of President Barack Obama&#x27;s legislative agenda in 2009, Cardin was tied for fifth most supportive senator with five other senators. In 2013, &quot;National Journal&quot; rated him as tied with six other Democratic senators for fifth most liberal senator. The American Conservative Union gave him a 4% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.

=== Agriculture ===
In June 2019, Cardin and eighteen other Democratic senators sent a letter to USDA Inspector General (IG) Phyllis K. Fong with the request that the IG investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserted that not conducting an investigation would mean these &quot;actions could be perceived as a part of this administration&#x27;s broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists.&quot;

===Death penalty===

Senator Cardin is a supporter of the death penalty but says it should only be applied to the &quot;worst of the worst&quot;.

=== Economy ===
In March 2019, Cardin was one of six senators to sign a letter to the Federal Trade Commission requesting it &quot;use its rulemaking authority, along with other tools, in order to combat the scourge of non-compete clauses rigging our economy against workers&quot; and espousing the view that such provisions &quot;harm employees by limiting their ability to find alternate work, which leaves them with little leverage to bargain for better wages or working conditions with their immediate employer.&quot; The senators furthered that the FTC had the responsibility of protecting both consumers and workers and needed to &quot;act decisively&quot; to address their concerns over &quot;serious anti-competitive harms from the proliferation of non-competes in the economy.&quot;

===Education===

In 2007, Cardin supported the United States Public Service Academy Act. The Act would serve to create &quot;an undergraduate institution devoted to developing civilian leaders.&quot; Like the Military Academies, this would give students 4 years of tuition-free education in exchange for 5 years of public service upon graduation.

===Environment===

Liberal environmentalists criticized Cardin for compromising too much while working with conservative James Inhofe on an amendment to Cardin&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay legislation. Josh Saks, senior legislative representative for water resources campaigns with the National Wildlife Federation, praised Cardin as &quot;the lead voice for clean water and the restoration of America&#x27;s great waters in Congress.&quot;

In November 2018, Cardin was one of twenty-five Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution specifying key findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators&#x27; acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action toward addressing climate change.

In March 2019, Cardin was one of eleven senators to sponsor the Climate Security Act of 2019, legislation forming a new group within the State Department that would have the responsibility for developing strategies to integrate climate science and data into operations of national security as well as restoring the post of special envoy for the Arctic, which had been dismantled by President Trump in 2017. The proposed envoy would advise the president and the administration on the potential effects of climate on national security and be responsible for facilitating all interagency communication between federal science and security agencies.

===Elections===

In October 2018, Cardin cosponsored, together with Chris Van Hollen and Susan Collins, a bipartisan bill that if passed would block &quot;any persons from foreign adversaries from owning or having control over vendors administering U.S. elections.&quot; Protect Our Elections Act would make companies involved in administering elections reveal foreign owners, and informing local, state and federal authorities if said ownership changes. Companies failing to comply would face fines of $100,000.

=== Equal Rights Amendment ===
Cardin has sponsored legislation in support of the Equal Rights Amendment.

===Gun control===
Cardin has an &quot;F&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.

In 2013, he co-sponsored the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act in an effort to ban large-capacity ammunition.

In response to the Orlando nightclub shooting, Cardin questioned the legality of military style assault weapons stating that &quot;in my observations in Maryland, I don&#x27;t know too many people who need to have that type of weapon in order to do hunting in my state or to keep themselves safe.&quot;

Cardin opposed the 2016 sale of approximately 26,000 assault rifles to the national police of the Philippines. His opposition led to the U.S. State Department halting the sale.

In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Cardin stated that thoughts and prayers were not going to save more people from dying in mass shootings. He also made a call for action to change gun laws, stating on Twitter that &quot;Automatic weapons aren&#x27;t needed to hunt deer or ducks; they&#x27;re meant to kill people.&quot; In response to the shooting, Cardin sponsored Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s proposal to ban bump stocks, which were used by the shooter to kill 58 individuals and injure over 500.

=== Journalism ===
In July 2019, Cardin and Rob Portman introduced the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill that would create a new memorial that would be privately funded and constructed on federal lands within Washington, D.C. in order to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters that have died in the line of duty.

===Healthcare===

In the 111th Congress, Cardin helped secure dental benefits in the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Plan.

In August 2019, Cardin was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to aid in the comprehension of states and Congress on potential consequences in the event that the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act (ACA) lawsuit prevailed in courts, citing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form &quot;an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets&quot;.

In October 2019, Cardin was one of twenty-seven senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating for the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it &quot;would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.&quot;

=== Housing ===
In April 2019, Cardin was one of forty-one senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that President Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

===International policy===

On October 31, 2011, Cardin endorsed the proposal for the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA). He is one of only six persons who served as members of the United States Congress ever to do so and is the only one who did so while in office.

Cardin has often supported positions that aim to strengthen America&#x27;s relationship with Israel. In 2017, Cardin sponsored a bill, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), that would penalize commercial businesses that wanted to aid International NGOs and/or organizations in boycotting Israel. Cardin has argued that Israel&#x27;s human rights record should not be considered in regard to sending U.S. military aid to Israel.

He supported civilian nuclear cooperation with India.

Weeks after the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement broke out which demands genuine universal suffrage among other goals, Cardin among bipartisan colleagues joined U.S. senator Sherrod Brown and Rep. Chris Smith&#x27;s effort to introduce Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act which would update the United States–Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and U.S. commitment to Hong Kong&#x27;s freedom and democracy. &quot;Civil society and democratic freedoms are under attack around the world and Hong Kong is on the front lines. The United States has a responsibility to protect human rights and defend against these threats,&quot; Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee said.

In July 2017, Cardin voted in favor of the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that placed sanctions on Iran together with Russia and North Korea. On October 11, 2017, in a joint statement, Cardin and Senator John McCain questioned the Trump administration&#x27;s commitment to the sanctions bill.
In October 2017, Cardin condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.

In August 2018, Cardin and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China&#x27;s Xinjiang region. They wrote: &quot;The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in &#x27;political reeducation&#x27; centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.&quot;

Cardin condemned President Erdoğan&#x27;s wide-ranging crackdown on dissent following a failed July 2016 coup in America&#x27;s NATO ally Turkey.

In April 2019, Cardin was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to President Trump encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding&#x27;s helping to improve conditions in those countries.

In 2023 Senator Cardin became the chair of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. According to &quot;Jewish Insider&quot;, Cardin&#x27;s office communicated to some activists that it does not have a plan to move the Mahsa Amini Human rights and Security Accountability Act (MAHSA Act) forward through the committee, likely killing the bipartisan Iran sanctions bill.

=== LGBTQ+ rights ===
In 2022, Cardin voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation intended to codify same-sex marriage rights into federal law.

===Online privacy===
Cardin supports Net Neutrality, as shown by his vote during the 109th Congress in favor of the Markey Amendment to H.R. 5252 which would add Net Neutrality provisions to the federal telecommunications code. Cardin also supports Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, which gives DOJ the tools to target those site owners who are engaged in illegal digital piracy.

===Taxes===

Cardin is opposed to eliminating the tax deduction for charitable donations and supports raising taxes on higher-income earners. During a December 20, 2012, interview with Maria Bartiromo on CNBC, Cardin stated, &quot;We&#x27;re now a few days away from Christmas. The easiest way to get the revenues is to get the rates from the higher income, uh, taxpayers.&quot; In response to the question, &quot;Are you prepared to vote to limit the loophole of charitable deductions?&quot; Cardin responded, &quot;No.&quot;

Cardin has, on multiple occasions, introduced a bill to adopt a &quot;Progressive Consumption Tax&quot;, which is a variation of Michael J. Graetz&#x27;s Competitive Tax Plan.

Cardin spoke out after the Pandora Papers were revealed in 2021. Cardin said, &quot;The Pandora Papers are a wake-up call to all who care about the future of democracy. Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, it is time for democracies to band together and demand an end to the unprecedented corruption that has come to be the defining feature of the global order. We must purge the dirty money from our systems and deny kleptocrats safe haven.&quot;

===Whistleblowers===

In November 2011, Cardin&#x27;s intended update of the 1917 Espionage Act upset some public disclosure advocates. They complained that it &quot;would make it harder for federal employees to expose government fraud and abuse.&quot;

=== Israel ===

Cardin is a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law. Cardin said that &quot;Congress will take action against efforts at the UN, or beyond, that use Resolution 2334 to target Israel.&quot;

Cardin supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. He stated: &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel and the location of the US Embassy should reflect this fact.&quot;

Cardin and Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) proposed the Israel Anti-Boycott Act in late 2018 which would make it illegal for companies to engage in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories. The bill would expand the Export Administration Act (EAA) to foreign boycotts imposed by international organizations like the European Union, Arab League and the United Nations. Cardin and Portman were strongly in promotion of the bill, and worked to integrate it into larger spending legislation to be signed by then-President Trump.

In January 2024, Cardin rejected Bernie Sanders&#x27; resolution that would have required the State Department to report to Congress on any evidence of human rights violations by Israel in Gaza. In May 2024, Cardin stated that &quot;Israel has not violated International Humanitarian Law&quot; and &quot;military assistance to support Israel&#x27;s security remains in the U.S. interest and should continue.&quot;

==Personal life==
Cardin married high school sweetheart Myrna Edelman, a teacher, on November 24, 1964. They have a daughter, Deborah. Their son Michael (born ) died of suicide on March 24, 1998, at age 30.

In 2002, Cardin&#x27;s 32-year-old nephew, Jon S. Cardin, was elected as a Delegate representing the 11th district of western Baltimore County. With the 11th legislative district overlapping the 3rd congressional district, there were two Cardins on the ticket in this area in 2002. Present at Jon&#x27;s swearing in was the oldest living former member of the House of Delegates at 95 years of age, Meyer Cardin, Jon&#x27;s grandfather and Ben&#x27;s father. Also in attendance was Cardin, who remarked, &quot;The next generation&#x27;s taking over.&quot;

<text>This is a list of the members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, along with the roles they fulfil and the date when they were sworn of the council. , there are 745 members on the council. The prefix &quot;The Rt Hon.&quot; is omitted here, because every counsellor bears it, as is the postnominal &quot;PC&quot;, as every counsellor who is also a peer uses it.

The council is composed mostly of politicians (both members of the UK government and parliament, and members of the devolved governments and legislatures) and civil servants, both serving and retired (since membership is for life). Among those politicians generally sworn of the council are ministers of the Crown, the few most senior figures of the Loyal Opposition, the UK parliamentary leader of the third-largest party, the first ministers of the devolved governments (including, in the case of Northern Ireland, the deputy first minister), and the speakers or presiding officers of the UK parliament and the devolved legislatures. Besides these, the council includes a few members of the Royal family (usually the consort and heir apparent only), more than two hundred senior UK judges (the Supreme Court justices, the senior judges of England and Wales, as well as the senators of the College of Justice of the Inner House in Scotland) and a few clergy (the three most senior Church of England bishops, namely the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London).

<doc id="414538" wikidata="Q1619372" url="?curid=414538" title="Albert Wynn">
<text>Albert Russell Wynn (born September 10, 1951) is an American lobbyist and former politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing the 4th district of Maryland from 1993 to 2008. On February 13, 2008, Wynn was defeated in the Democratic primary by Donna Edwards, and resigned his office effective May 31, 2008.

==Early life and education==
Wynn was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He was educated at the University of Pittsburgh, Howard University, and Georgetown University Law Center. While attending the University of Pittsburgh, Wynn was initiated as a member of the Beta Epsilon chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

Soon after graduating, Wynn became director of the Prince George&#x27;s County Consumer Protection Commission. In 1982, he founded his own law firm. He then spent a decade in the Maryland General Assembly, serving in the state house from 1983 to 1987 and in the state senate from 1987 to 1993.

==Career==
Wynn entered the Democratic primary for the 4th District in 1992. The 4th had been reconfigured as a black-majority district after the 1990 Census, and the previous incumbent, three-term Democrat Tom McMillen, had been drawn out of the district. Wynn won a crowded seven-way primary by 1,300 votes, all but assuring him of election in the heavily Democratic district. He won the general election in November with 75 percent of the vote and was reelected seven times, never dropping below 75 percent of the vote.

Wynn was a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where he chaired the Subcommittee on the Environment and Hazardous Materials. Wynn placed a high priority on economic issues. Wynn also supported the energy bill promoted by Vice President and former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney.

During the 105th Congress, Wynn sponsored legislation passed to improve federal contracting opportunities for small and minority businesses. He has twice received the Small Business Administration &quot;Administrator&#x27;s Leadership Award&quot; for his efforts on behalf of small businesses.

His 2000 re-election race made headlines, when the Congressman&#x27;s estranged wife, Jessie Wynn, served as the campaign manager for his Republican opponent, John B. Kimble. In radio spots for Kimble&#x27;s campaign, Mrs. Wynn stated &quot;Albert Wynn does not respect black women. He left me for the white woman.&quot;

During the 107th Congress, Wynn was one of only four of 36 Congressional Black Caucus members who voted on October 10, 2002 for the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War. The other three Congressional Black Caucus members who voted for the resolution authorizing the Iraq War were Bill Jefferson of Louisiana, Sanford Bishop of Georgia, and Harold Ford, Jr. of Tennessee. Wynn also served on the Congressional Black Caucus&#x27; Political Action Committee and its Minority Business Task Force.

Wynn has issued statements of support for integrating illegal aliens into society, so long as strong border security provisions are included. He spoke at the Washington, D.C. Immigration Rally in April 2006, condemning H. R. 4437 and other bills that aim to deport all illegal immigrants. On Wynn&#x27;s official website, he says &quot;Now that they are in this country, we owe them respect and fair treatment.&quot;

===2006 congressional elections===

In 2006, he was challenged in the Democratic primary by community activist Donna Edwards, most recently executive director of the Arca Foundation. Edwards, who had clerked for Wynn in the 1980s while he served in the state legislature, criticized Wynn for his votes to support the Iraq war, repeal of the estate tax, support of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005, and of the Bush Administration&#x27;s energy bill, arguing that he was too conservative and too closely allied with Republicans. While Wynn was initially heavily favored, Edwards showed surprising strength. Two weeks before the primary, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; endorsed Edwards.

The primary was held on September 12, and when all the votes had been counted, Wynn defeated Edwards by 49.7 percent to 46.4 percent — by 2,725 votes out of more than 82,000 cast. George McDermott, a little-known candidate, took 3.9 percent. The final tally of the primary was unclear for nearly two weeks because of widespread voting problems on new electronic voting machines in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.

===2008 congressional elections===

Edwards sought a rematch in 2008. This time, Edwards won the backing of the influential MoveOn.org. Edwards also had the support of many progressive community organizations, and many influential netroots organizations such as Daily Kos and OpenLeft.

In the primary, Edwards routed Wynn, 60 percent to 36 percent.

===Resignation ===

On March 27, 2008, Wynn announced his resignation from Congress effective in June.

Edwards was elected in a special election to finish out the rest of Wynn&#x27;s term, defeating anti-war Republican primary winner Peter James in the general election in November 2008.

===Post-congressional career===

He became a partner of Dickstein Shapiro, a large lobbying firm whose clients include the tobacco, entertainment, energy, and software industries as well as the Teamsters. Because House rules prohibit former members from lobbying current members of Congress for one year after departing, Wynn began lobbying Congress in June 2009 instead of in January 2010 due to his early resignation.

<doc id="414545" wikidata="Q1173181" url="?curid=414545" title="Dave Dudley">
<text>Dave Dudley (born David Darwin Pedruska; May 3, 1928 – December 22, 2003) was an American country music singer best known for his truck-driving country anthems of the 1960s and 1970s and his semi-slurred bass. His signature song was &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot;, and he is also remembered for &quot;Vietnam Blues&quot;, &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Son-of-a-Gun&quot;, and &quot;Me and ol&#x27; C.B.&quot;. Other recordings included Dudley&#x27;s duet with Tom T. Hall, &quot;Day Drinking&quot;, and his own Top 10 hit, &quot;Fireball Rolled A Seven&quot;, supposedly based on the career and death of Edward Glenn &quot;Fireball&quot; Roberts.

==Biography==
===Early life and rise to fame===
Born in Spencer, Wisconsin, United States, Dudley&#x27;s grandparents came from Königsberg in East Prussia, Germany. At the age of 11, he was given a guitar by his grandfather and learned to play the chords.

He had a short career as a semi-professional baseball player. After he suffered an arm injury, he was no longer able to play baseball. He then decided to pursue a career in country music. He was one of the earliest artists to record for the National Recording Corporation, with &quot;Where&#x27;s There&#x27;s A Will&quot; (1959).

Dudley was injured once again in 1960, this time in a car accident, setting back his career in music. He first appeared on the Country charts in 1961 with &quot;Maybe I Do&quot;, released by Vee Records. He later moved to Golden Wing Records.

===Height of his career===
In 1963, &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot; became a hit for Dudley. The song was written by Earl Green and Peanutt Montgomery. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

In the original version of the song as recorded by Dudley the lyrics include the words &quot;...I&#x27;m taking little white pills and my eyes are open wide...&quot; a reference to the stimulants some truckers used to keep driving (and make their delivery times) when they needed sleep. Some remakes of the song replace these words with a reference to looking at the white lines on the road.

In 1963, Dudley moved on to Mercury Records. By the end of 1963, he released his first single from the label, &quot;Last Day in the Mines&quot;. Dudley scored more big hits in the 1960s, including &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Son-of-a-Gun&quot;, &quot;Trucker&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and &quot;Anything Leaving Town Today&quot;. &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot; was subsequently recorded by several other artists including George Thorogood and the Destroyers, Steve Earle, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Sawyer Brown.

Dudley continued to have success into the 1970s, while continuing to record for Mercury Records. He had some country Top 10s in the 1970s, including &quot;Comin&#x27; Down&quot; and &quot;Fly Away Again&quot;. By the late 1970s, his success on the charts was beginning to fade, although Dudley amassed thirty-three Top 40 Country hits.

In 1978, Dudley&#x27;s name became known to the audience in Germany after the German country band Truck Stop had a single Top 10 hit in Germany, titled &quot;Ich möcht’ so gern Dave Dudley hör’n&quot; (&quot;I would like to listen to Dave Dudley so much, to Hank Snow and Charley Pride&quot;).

===Late career and death===
In the 1980s, Dudley continued to record sporadically, and remained popular in concert. During this time, he was elected to the &#x27;Nashville Teamsters Truck Drivers Union&#x27;, receiving a solid gold membership card from the union. During this time, he also found out that he had a big fan base in Europe, and he decided to try to appeal more to this market. Dudley purchased Staples Lake Resort in the mid 1970s and ran a successful business/resort there until the mid to late 1980s with wife, Marie. During his ownership he also sponsored multiple country music festivals on the property.

In total, Dudley recorded more than 70 albums. However, he did not manage to reclaim his past success, and neither his single &quot;Where&#x27;s That Truck?&quot;, recorded with disc jockey Charlie Douglas, nor the track &quot;Dave Dudley, American Trucker&quot;, recorded in 2002 in the wake of the September 11 attacks, helped revive his career. Few of his hits have made it onto CDs and albums, creating a market for his vintage vinyl recordings.

Dudley died on December 22, 2003, aged 75, after suffering a heart attack in his car in a parking lot in Danbury, Wisconsin.

<doc id="414548" wikidata="Q1680843" url="?curid=414548" title="James Molyneaux, Baron Molyneaux of Killead">
<text>James Henry Molyneaux, Baron Molyneaux of Killead, KBE, PC (27 August 1920 – 9 March 2015), often known as Jim Molyneaux, was a unionist politician from Northern Ireland who served as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from 1979 to 1995, and as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Antrim from 1970 to 1983, and later Lagan Valley from 1983 to 1997. An Orangeman, he was also Sovereign Grand Master of the Royal Black Institution from 1971 to 1995, and a leading member of the Conservative Monday Club.

==Early life==
Born in Killead, a small village in County Antrim, to Sarah (née Gilmore) and William Molyneaux, James Molyneaux was educated at a nearby school in Aldergrove. Although he was a member of the Church of Ireland, he briefly attended a local Roman Catholic primary school.

==Military service==
Molyneaux served in the Royal Air Force between 1941 and 1946, including most of the Second World War. He took part in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and occasionally gave interviews about what he saw there. On 1 April 1947, he was promoted to flying officer.

==Political career==
From 1964 until the 1970s, Molyneaux served on Antrim County Council. At the 1970 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for South Antrim, succeeding Sir Knox Cunningham, with whom he had worked closely as honorary secretary of the South Antrim Unionist Association.

South Antrim had one of the largest electorates of any parliamentary constituency, and it consistently returned Unionist MPs with large majorities. Cunningham&#x27;s 1959 majority of 50,041 was the largest in the United Kingdom, achieved with 95.1% of the votes. Molyneaux won over 60% of the votes in each of the four elections he contested in South Antrim, and at the 1979 general election his 69.0% share of the votes gave him a majority of 38,868 votes, the largest in the United Kingdom.

Molyneaux&#x27;s maiden speech, made on 15 February 1971, focused on the security situation in Northern Ireland at that time, and concluded: &quot;The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are keen to make their contribution to the greater unit of the United Kingdom, just as we, their representatives in this House, try to play our part. Collectively, Ulstermen and women will do what is asked of them, as they have done in the past, both in peace and in war.&quot;

In October 1974, Molyneaux became leader of the Ulster Unionists in the House of Commons. From 1982 to 1986, he sat as a UUP member for South Antrim in the Northern Ireland Assembly which was unable to deliver devolution at that time. Molyneaux was admitted to the Privy Council in 1982, and in October that year he survived two Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) assassination attempts.

With then UUP leader Harry West, Molyneaux had played a significant role in negotiations with James Callaghan&#x27;s minority Labour government which led to Northern Ireland&#x27;s representation in the Commons being increased from 12 to 17 seats, under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1979. The extra seats were added for the 1983 general election, when the resulting boundary changes divided South Antrim, and Molyneaux was elected for the new seat of Lagan Valley.

=== UUP leadership ===
Harry West had lost his Westminster seat in the October 1974 general election, and did not stand in the subsequent general election in May 1979. Then in the European Parliament election held in June of that year, West stood in the new three-seat Northern Ireland constituency. He was not only out-polled by almost three-to-one by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley but was beaten to the third seat by his own party colleague John Taylor. West resigned the leadership shortly after his defeat, and was succeeded by Molyneaux.

After a decade of turmoil in which the UUP had four leaders and many splits, Molyneaux was seen as a steadying influence. He was a traditional right-wing Orangeman with a quiet style which contrasted with the flamboyance of Ian Paisley&#x27;s leadership of the DUP. His reticence was both innate and tactical; as his party was united around a constitutional stance rather than a socio-economic programme, he regarded his task as more like that of a manager than a leader, and his successor David Trimble said that Molyneaux &quot;did things quietly and consensually&quot;. He was so deeply loyal to the Conservative-turned-Ulster Unionist MP Enoch Powell that Northern Ireland Secretary Jim Prior said that Powell worked James Molyneaux with his foot. In his memoirs, Prior wrote that &quot;at Westminster he was Enoch&#x27;s puppet&quot; while Molyneaux had called Prior &quot;pig-headed and stupid&quot; in 1983, unsuccessfully demanding Prior&#x27;s replacement.

Molyneaux was generally regarded as a member of the integrationist wing within the UUP (favouring direct rule from Westminster with some extension of local government powers, as opposed to the devolutionist preference for a revived Northern Ireland Parliament or a new regional Assembly). This preference was widely attributed to the influence of Enoch Powell. Critics within Molyneaux&#x27;s party saw Molyneaux as a do-nothing leader, with undue deference to the Conservative Party. Molyneaux&#x27;s defenders argue that his primary concern was party unity, and that the UUP was so divided that only a minimalist policy could hold it together. His ability to accommodate the various factions of unionism was enhanced by his leadership of the Royal Black Institution and his senior role in the Orange Order. Under his leadership, there was no repetition of the splits of 1970s, and the slide in the party&#x27;s vote share was halted. He was, however, the last UUP leader to avoid those perils.

During the 1980s, Molyneaux was an active member of the Conservative Monday Club. Molyneaux was co-opted onto the club&#x27;s Executive Council on 23 June 1983. and later became a vice-president of the club. In the October 1985 Conservative Party Conference issue of the club&#x27;s tabloid newspaper, &quot;Right Ahead&quot;, just before the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, he contributed a lengthy article entitled &#x27;Northern Ireland – Ulster belongs to Britain NOT to the Irish Republic&#x27;. Molyneaux was present at an Executive Council meeting in December 1990 which accepted a decision to stop employing salaried staff at the Club because of its financial deficit. He subsequently left the Monday Club in February 1991.

In March 2016, gay Conservative Party activist Christopher Luke claimed that he had had a long-term platonic ‘David and Jonathan’ relationship with Molyneaux until the latter&#x27;s death. Luke had claimed to have met Molyneaux at a Monday Club event in 1984. However, Molyneaux&#x27;s relatives and former colleagues questioned the truthfulness of Luke&#x27;s claims, which were not verified by others. Luke died at the age of 50 in December 2017. 

Former member of Belfast City Council Jeff Dudgeon, who is openly gay, stated that Molyneaux had &quot;some sort of homosexual sensibilities&quot;.

According to the book &quot;Angels with Blue Faces&quot;, by the journalist Lyra McKee, Molyneaux was interviewed by a senior RUC detective in relation to the Kincora Boys&#x27; Home abuse scandal but not arrested or charged, although McKee alleged that he and others were involved in a conspiracy relating to the case:

Politically, under Molyneaux&#x27;s leadership, the UUP gained the newly created seats of East Antrim, Lagan Valley, Londonderry East, Newry and Armagh, Strangford, and Upper Bann in the 1983 general election, as well as gaining North Belfast (from the DUP) and Fermanagh and South Tyrone (from Sinn Féin). It also held South Belfast and his former constituency of South Antrim throughout his time as party leader; the more conservative DUP did not increase its number of (three) MPs over that time and by 1992, several unionist majorities were secured by electoral pacts between the two parties.

The party lost Newry and Armagh in 1986 and South Down in 1987 but maintained its number of (nine) MPs in the 1992 general election, including future leader David Trimble following his success in the 1990 Upper Bann by-election. Two life peers representing the party were also appointed in the early 1990s - Lord Cooke and Lord McConnell. The UUP was the largest party in the 1982-1986 Northern Ireland Assembly and increased its number of councillors in each local government election between 1981 and 1993.

Former &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist Chris Ryder reflected that Molyneaux was &quot;at heart a shire Conservative&quot; and an &quot;intensely private and discreet man&quot;. Molyneaux had led an UUP delegation to hold talks with the Irish Government in Dublin in 1992, a significant development at that time, and his support for the Downing Street Declaration by John Major and Albert Reynolds in 1993 was &quot;crucial, for it helped calm deep unionist fears&quot;.

=== Anglo-Irish Agreement ===
Molyneaux&#x27;s loyalty to the Conservatives led to him being taken by surprise by the November 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, and overshadowed by Ian Paisley.

On 17 December 1985, Molyneaux resigned his seat, along with his fourteen unionist colleagues in the House of Commons, in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The fifteen Unionist MPs hoped that the by-elections could be portrayed as referendum on the agreement. He was re-elected in the resulting January 1986 by-election, along with all but one of the fourteen other unionists: the UUP&#x27;s Jim Nicholson, who was defeated in Newry and Armagh by Seamus Mallon of the SDLP.

He felt most at home in Westminster, and believed that behind-the-scenes influence in London was the most effective path for unionist influence. He opposed formal power-sharing between unionists and nationalists, and routinely dismissed political initiatives, criticising SDLP leader John Hume for “grubbing around the back-streets of Belfast&quot; to open dialogue with Sinn Féin while the IRA&#x27;s violent campaign continued.

=== Peace process ===
In August 1994, the Provisional IRA called a ceasefire, which Molyneaux described as &quot;the most destabilising event since partition&quot; and &quot;the worst thing that has ever happened to us&quot;.

In March 1995, Molyneaux was challenged for the leadership of the UUP by a 21-year-old student and, although he won easily, the election saw a strong protest vote against Molyneaux&#x27;s leadership registered. Following the UUP&#x27;s poor showing in the 1995 North Down by-election, Molyneaux yielded to renewed pressure to retire as leader in September of that year; he had also just turned 75 years of age. After retiring as UUP leader, Molyneaux was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1996. After standing down as an MP at the 1997 general election, Molyneaux was created a life peer on 10 June 1997 as Baron Molyneaux of Killead, of Killead in the County of Antrim.

When a Roman Catholic church near his home was burnt down by loyalist arsonists in the late 1990s, Molyneaux helped raise funds to rebuild it.

His last speech as a Member of Parliament, on 19 March 1997, recognised the Callaghan Government&#x27;s role in &quot;granting Northern Ireland free and equal representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.&quot;

=== Retirement ===
Molyneaux&#x27;s maiden speech in the House of Lords, on 3 July 1997, was critical of the peace process and noted &quot;the necessity calmly to consider the impact of current events on the long-term interests of Ulster and to give absolute priority to draining the lake of bitterness in which the terrorists have been permitted to swim for far too long.&quot;

On several occasions in his retirement, Molyneaux was publicly critical of his successor, David Trimble. He fiercely opposed the Good Friday Agreement, and in 2003 supported three Ulster Unionist MPs (David Burnside, Jeffrey Donaldson and Martin Smyth) when they resigned the party whip in protest against Trimble&#x27;s leadership and the party&#x27;s support for the Agreement.

In the 2005 general election, Molyneaux caused controversy within unionism when he and Smyth endorsed the Democratic Unionist Party candidate Jimmy Spratt over the UUP candidate Michael McGimpsey in Smyth&#x27;s former constituency of South Belfast. Molyneaux also endorsed Donaldson, his own successor as MP for Lagan Valley, even after Donaldson had defected to the DUP, as well as anti-Trimble UUP candidates such as Burnside. In the election, Donaldson held Lagan Valley by a large majority, while Spratt outpolled McGimpsey (although losing to the SDLP candidate Alasdair McDonnell on a split vote); many claimed that Molyneaux and Smyth&#x27;s endorsements had contributed to the UUP&#x27;s disastrous showing. However, Burnside lost his seat.

Molyneaux made his last speech to the House of Lords in February 2006, expressing concern for families affected by poor service from the Child Support Agency. He continued to regularly vote in the House of Lords until his last vote on the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 in October 2008.

==Death==
Molyneaux died at the age of 94 in Antrim, Northern Ireland, on 9 March 2015, Commonwealth Day.

Tributes were formally paid in the Northern Ireland Assembly and led by then UUP party leader, Mike Nesbitt, who remarked: &quot;The sight of Lord Molyneaux as Ulster Unionist leader wearing his medals as he laid the wreath on behalf of the party at the Cenotaph every Remembrance Sunday in London was a powerful image that epitomised the ideals of dignity and service, which he embodied.&quot;

<text>Steny Hamilton Hoyer ( ; born June 14, 1939) is an American politician and retired attorney who has served as the U.S. representative for since 1981. He also served as House Majority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. Hoyer first attained office through a special election on May 19, 1981, and is in his 23rd House term. His district includes a large swath of rural and suburban territory southeast of Washington, D.C. Hoyer is the dean of the Maryland congressional delegation and the most senior Democrat in the House.

From 2003 to 2023, Hoyer was the second-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives behind Nancy Pelosi. He is a two-time House majority leader, having served in the post from 2007 to 2011 under Speaker Pelosi. During two periods of Republican House control (2003–2007 and 2011–2019), Hoyer served as House minority whip, both times under Minority Leader Pelosi. Following the 2018 midterm elections in which the Democrats took control of the House, Hoyer was reelected majority leader in 2019 for the 116th Congress; he remained the number two House Democrat behind Speaker Pelosi. He announced on November 17, 2022, that he, along with Pelosi, would not seek a leadership position in the 118th Congress, though he would remain a member of the House.

==Early life and education==
Hoyer was born in New York City but grew up in Mitchellville, Maryland, the son of Jean (née Baldwin) and Steen Theilgaard Høyer. His father was Danish and a native of Copenhagen; &quot;Steny&quot; is a variant of his father&#x27;s name, &quot;Steen&quot;. His mother was an American with Scottish, German, and English ancestry and a descendant of John Hart, a signer of the US Declaration of Independence.

Steny Hoyer graduated from Suitland High School in Suitland, Maryland. In 1963, Hoyer received his B.A. degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and graduated Omicron Delta Kappa from the University of Maryland, College Park. He was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He earned his J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1966.

==Early political career==
From 1962 to 1966, Hoyer was a member of the staff of U.S. Senator Daniel Brewster; also on Brewster&#x27;s staff at that time was Nancy Pelosi.

In 1966, Hoyer won a newly created seat in the Maryland State Senate, representing Prince George&#x27;s County–based Senate district 4C. The district, created in the aftermath of &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, was renumbered as the 26th in 1975, the same year that Hoyer was elected president of the Maryland State Senate, the youngest in state history.

From 1969 to 1971, Hoyer served as the first vice president of the Young Democrats of America.

In 1978, Hoyer sought the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Maryland as the running mate of then acting Governor Blair Lee III, but lost to Samuel Bogley, 37%–34%. The same year, Hoyer was appointed to the Maryland Board of Higher Education, a position he held until 1981.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Fifth district Congresswoman Gladys Spellman fell into a coma shortly before the 1980 election. She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, beating Spellman&#x27;s husband, Reuben, by only 1,600 votes. He defeated a better-funded Republican, Bowie Mayor Audrey Scott, in the May 19 special election. 56%–44%, earning himself the nickname &quot;boy wonder&quot;. In the 1982 general election, Hoyer was reelected to a full term with 80% of the vote. He has faced only one relatively close contest since then, when he defeated future Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan with 53% of the vote in 1992. His second-lowest margin of victory was his 1996 race against Republican State Delegate John Morgan, when he received 57% of the vote. Hoyer has been reelected 14 times with no substantive opposition and is the longest-serving House member ever from Maryland.

===Tenure===

====Domestic issues====
Hoyer supports and has led the &quot;Make It In America&quot; plan linking the domestic manufacturing industry and overall U.S. economic success.

Hoyer is pro-choice on abortion rights. He voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. (However, at the height of national polarization after the Supreme Court&#x27;s intention to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; leaked, Hoyer controversially endorsed a pro-life incumbent House member over his pro-choice primary challenger.) Hoyer supports affirmative action and LGBT rights. He is rated &quot;F&quot; by the NRA Political Victory Fund, indicating that he tends to vote in favor of gun control.

In 2008, Hoyer said he opposed providing immunity to telecom companies, but then negotiated a bill, which Senators Patrick Leahy and Russ Feingold called a &quot;capitulation&quot;, that would provide immunity to any telecom company that had been told by the George W. Bush administration that its actions were legal. &quot;No matter how they spin it, this is still immunity&quot;, said Kevin Bankston, a senior lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights group that sued over Bush&#x27;s wiretapping program. &quot;It&#x27;s not compromise, it&#x27;s pure theater.&quot;

In June 2010, Hoyer brought up the idea that Congress could temporarily extend middle-class tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, suggesting that making them permanent would cost too much. President Obama wanted to extend them permanently for people making less than $200,000 a year and families making less than $250,000.

Hoyer voted against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1999. In 2019 and 2021, Hoyer voted to impeach President Donald Trump.

In February 2021, Hoyer made a speech in Congress that has been viewed online more than two million times, criticizing a Facebook post by U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. The post featured a gun-toting Greene next to three members of the &quot;Squad&quot;—Representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Rashida Tlaib—with the caption &quot;Democrats&#x27; Worst Nightmare&quot;. In his speech, Hoyer compared Greene&#x27;s words with those of Representative Steve King, who was removed from the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees in 2019 after comments he made to &quot;The New York Times&quot; questioning why white supremacy was considered offensive. Hoyer said that, in both posts, Greene had promoted baseless conspiracy theories far more offensive and incendiary than the comment that led Republicans to strip King of his committee roles. He asked his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to &quot;do the decent thing&quot; and strip Greene of her committee roles. The vote succeeded, with 11 Republicans joining Democrats to pass the motion to remove.

====Foreign issues====
Hoyer supports civilian nuclear cooperation with India.

Hoyer initially supported the Iraq War and was recognized by the DLC for his vocal leadership on this issue. After the war became publicly unpopular, he said he favored a &quot;responsible redeployment&quot;. But he repeatedly supported legislation to continue funding the war without deadlines for troop withdrawal, most recently in return for increased funding of domestic projects.

Hoyer is a supporter of Israel, and has often been allied with American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). In September 2007, he criticized Representative Jim Moran for suggesting that AIPAC &quot;has pushed [the Iraq] war from the beginning&quot;, calling the comment &quot;factually inaccurate&quot;. In January 2017, he voted for a House resolution condemning UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories a flagrant violation of international law and a major obstacle to peace.

Hoyer supported President Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. In 2023, he voted with an overwhelming bipartisan majority to provide Israel with whatever support is necessary in the &quot;barbaric war&quot; in Gaza started by Hamas and other terrorists following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.

Hoyer has said that a nuclear Iran is &quot;unacceptable&quot; and that the use of force remains an option.

In January 2019, Hoyer opposed Trump&#x27;s planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan as &quot;impulsive, irresponsible, and dangerous&quot;. He supports former President Obama&#x27;s call for authorizing limited but decisive military action in response to the Assad regime&#x27;s alleged use of chemical weapons.

Hoyer is a former chair of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.

====Legislation====
On February 28, 2014, Hoyer introduced the bill to amend the National Law Enforcement Museum Act to extend the termination date (H.R. 4120; 113th Congress). The bill would extend until November 9, 2016, the authority of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization, to construct a museum on federal lands in the District of Columbia honoring law enforcement officers.

====Fundraising====
Hoyer is a prolific fundraiser for House Democrats. He has been the top giver to fellow party members in the House. In the 2008 election cycle, he contributed more than $1 million to the party and individual candidates as of July 14, 2008.

===Party leadership===
Hoyer served as chair of the Democratic Caucus, the fourth-ranking position among House Democrats, from 1989 to 1994; a former co-chair of the Democratic Steering Committee; and as the chief candidate recruiter for House Democrats from 1995 to 2000. He also served as Deputy Majority Whip from 1987 to 1989.

When David E. Bonior resigned as minority whip in early 2002, Hoyer ran in the race to succeed him but lost to Nancy Pelosi. After the 2002 midterm elections, Pelosi ran to succeed Dick Gephardt as minority leader, leaving the minority whip post open again. On November 14, 2002, Hoyer&#x27;s colleagues in the Democratic Caucus unanimously elected him minority whip, the second-highest-ranking position among House Democrats.

Pelosi became the Speaker of the House in January 2007. Hoyer was elected by his colleagues to be House Majority Leader for the 110th Congress, defeating John Murtha of Pennsylvania by a vote of 149–86 within the caucus, despite Pelosi&#x27;s endorsement of Murtha. Hoyer was the first Marylander to become Majority Leader and became the highest-ranking federal lawmaker in Maryland history. In this post, Hoyer was the House Democrats&#x27; floor leader and ranked second in the leadership, after the Speaker.

The day after the 2010 midterm elections, in which the Democrats lost control of the House, Hoyer had a private conversation with Pelosi and said he would not challenge her for minority leader. He ran for minority whip, but was challenged by outgoing Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (the top House Democrats wanted to remain in the leadership, but the minority party in the House has one less position). Hoyer is moderate while Pelosi and Clyburn are more liberal, and a significant number of Hoyer&#x27;s would-be supporters in the House who were moderate and conservative Democrats had been defeated for reelection. The Congressional Black Caucus backed Clyburn, while 30 House Democrats have supported Hoyer. Hoyer received further support from outgoing Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard L. Berman, Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, and outgoing Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman Pelosi intervened in the contest by supporting Hoyer as Minority Whip, while creating an &quot;Assistant Leader&quot; position for Clyburn, which would keep him as the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind Pelosi and Hoyer (the existing &quot;Assistant to the Leader&quot; post formerly held by Chris Van Hollen is not officially part of the House leadership and was directly appointed by the Minority Leader).

Hoyer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) have been criticized for picking their preferred candidates through an undemocratic process. In 2018, it was reported that Hoyer sought to influence the primary race in Colorado&#x27;s 6th congressional district. He was recorded urging progressive candidate Levi Tillemann to drop out of the race. Hoyer acknowledged that the DCCC had already identified its preferred candidate and discouraged a candid discussion about his weaknesses. On November 28, 2018, Hoyer was selected to return as House Majority Leader.

==Personal life==

Hoyer has three daughters from his marriage to Judy Pickett Hoyer, who died of cancer in February 1997. In June 2012, after Hoyer announced his support of same-sex marriage, his daughter Stefany Hoyer Hemmer came out as a lesbian in an interview with the &quot;Washington Blade&quot;. A widower for 26 years, Hoyer married Elaine Kamarck, a Clinton administration official and the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, in June 2023.

Judy Hoyer was an advocate of early childhood education, and child development learning centers in Maryland have been named in her honor (&quot;Judy Centers&quot;). She also suffered from epilepsy, and the Epilepsy Foundation of America sponsors an annual public lecture in her name. Steny Hoyer, too, has been an advocate for research in this area, and in 2002 the Epilepsy Foundation gave him its Congressional Leadership Award.

Hoyer serves on the board of trustees for St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland and is a member of the board of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a nonprofit that supports international elections. He is also an Advisory Board Member for the Center for the Study of Democracy.

Hoyer is a member of a Baptist church.

On August 13, 2024 it was reported that Hoyer suffered a mild stroke.

<text>Robert Norman Waddell (born 7 January 1975) is a New Zealand Olympic Gold Medalist and double World Champion Single sculler rower, and America&#x27;s Cup yachtsman. He is a triple New Zealand Supreme &#x27;Halberg Awards&#x27; Sportsperson of the year winner, 1998 to 2000. He holds the third fastest 2000 metre indoor rowing machine time in the world, clocking a time of 5 mins 36.6 secs (5:36.6), which was the previous world record for 19 years before the time was improved by Joshua Dunkley-Smith. He also held the record for 5000m on the rowing machine with a time of 14min 58sec. This made him the first person to go below 15 min for this distance. He holds a black belt in judo. He played rugby union for Waikato. Waddell was Chef de Mission of the 2014 and 2018 New Zealand Commonwealth Games teams, and the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==

Waddell was born in 1975 in Te Kūiti. He went to school at Kings College. He studied at the University of Waikato, graduating in 1998 and being recognised as one of three distinguished alumni in a 2015 ceremony. In the 2001 New Year Honours, Waddell was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rowing.

In 1998, he married fellow rower Sonia Scown, the daughter of a former All Black, Alistair Scown.

==2003 Team New Zealand America&#x27;s Cup defence==

Rob Waddell switched to sailing for the Team New Zealand 2003 America&#x27;s Cup defence. He trained as a grinder.

==2007 America&#x27;s Cup==

He participated again in the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup. Following this, Waddell returned to rowing representing New Zealand in rowing at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the double sculls at the Beijing Olympics.

==2008 Olympics==

In 2008 he made a comeback to rowing after leaving the sport after the 2000 Sydney Olympics, in pursuit of a sailing career as a grinder. With 8 years out of the sport he broke the 2000 m and 5000 m world records on the rowing machine and defeated Mahé Drysdale, the world champion in the single sculls, who was also a New Zealander. As it was an Olympic year and only one crew can be sent to the Olympics in each boat class the stage was set for a battle to see who would fill the Olympic single sculls spot. Despite Waddell getting the better of Drysdale in the domestic regattas the selectors created a three-race trial to decide who would go. With the wins for each sculler tied at 1–1 it came down to a final race which Drysdale won.

Waddell was then selected into the double sculls with the young Nathan Cohen, world champion at the 2006 World University Games in single sculls, in early 2008. At the 2008 Olympic Games in Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park, Shunyi, Beijing in August 2008, the two finished fourth in the double sculls final.

Waddell retired from rowing to take up sailing again. Cohen went on to win the gold medal in double sculls at the next Olympic Games in 2012, with rowing partner Joseph Sullivan as Waddell&#x27;s replacement.

==2013 Team New Zealand America&#x27;s Cup challenge==

In the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup, which Team New Zealand won over Prada Luna Rossa, Waddell was a key grinder and member of the team that eventually went on to challenge Team Oracle USA for the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup.

<text>Nicholas Benton Alexander III (June 27, 1911 – July 5, 1969) was an American motion picture actor, who started out as a child actor in 1916. He is best remembered for his role as Officer Frank Smith in the &quot;Dragnet&quot; franchise.

==Early life and career==
A native of Goldfield, Nevada, Alexander was the son of Nicholas Benton Alexander Jr. and Elizabeth Hinkley.

After a number of silent films, he retired from screen work, but came back for the World War I classic, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), in which Alexander received good notices as an adult actor as &quot;Kemmerich&quot;, the tragic amputation victim. Earnings from the film allowed him to attend Stanford University; however, three years later, in the midst of the Great Depression, he was forced to leave school for lack of funds.

He found a new career as a successful radio announcer in the late 1940s, including a stint on &quot;The Martin and Lewis Show&quot;. Alexander also acted on radio, playing Philip West in the 1939–40 soap opera &quot;Brenthouse&quot; on the Blue Network.

From October 1950 to January 1951, Alexander hosted &quot;Party Time at Club Roma&quot;, a nightly late-night television show on NBC described as &quot;part &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;-type stunt show and part talent contest&quot;.

In 1952, Jack Webb, actor-producer-director of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, needed a replacement for Barton Yarborough, who had played Detective Romero opposite Webb&#x27;s Sgt. Joe Friday. Webb selected Alexander, but had to wait until he was available. A few actors filled in as Friday&#x27;s partners until Alexander appeared in the newly created role of Officer Frank Smith, first in the radio series, then reprised the role in film and on television. The popular series ran until 1959. When Webb revived it in 1966, he wanted Alexander to rejoin him, but Alexander had just signed to play the role of Sgt. Dan Briggs on the weekly ABC series &quot;Felony Squad&quot;.

==Other==

Alexander owned and operated the Ben Alexander Ford car dealership in the Highland Park neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles, from around 1953 until his death in 1969, along with the Ben Alexander Ford car dealership in San Francisco, which was formed in 1959.

In the mid-1950s, Ben Alexander&#x27;s Dream House Motel was located in Hollywood, near the corner of Yucca Street and Cahuenga Boulevard.
In 1960, Alexander was a semi-regular panelist on Ernie Kovacs&#x27; offbeat game show &quot;Take a Good Look&quot;, which he affectionately dubbed &quot;as unrigged and unrehearsed and un-produced a show as ever hit the air.&#x27;&quot; On April 19, 1960, and for roughly four years thereafter, he produced and hosted &quot;The Ben Alexander Show&quot;, a talent show airing on Oakland&#x27;s KTVU TV. What made this program especially noteworthy—and profitable for its creator/host—was the fact that Alexander was also the sponsor, via his auto dealership. &quot;Broadcast Magazine&quot; highlighted this seeming anomaly in its August 29 issue, exactly four months after the show&#x27;s debut.When a successful actor is also a successful businessman, that&#x27;s unusual. When, as a businessman, he sponsors himself as a tv performer, that&#x27;s rare. And when, the day after the opening broadcast, his business does three times its normal volume, that&#x27;s news.

==Death==
On July 5, 1969, Alexander was found dead as the result of a massive heart attack in his Los Angeles home when his wife and children returned from a camping trip.

He was cremated.

For his contributions to the entertainment industry, Ben Alexander was awarded three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television, radio, and movies.

<doc id="414562" wikidata="Q350927" url="?curid=414562" title="Adam Smith Institute">
<text>The Adam Smith Institute (ASI) is a UK-based neoliberal think tank and lobbying group, named after Adam Smith, a Scottish moral philosopher and classical economist. The Institute advocates free market and classical liberal ideas, primarily via the formation of policy options with regard to public choice theory, which political decision makers seek to develop upon. ASI President Madsen Pirie has sought to describe the activity of the organisation as &quot;[w]e propose things which people regard as being on the edge of lunacy. The next thing you know, they&#x27;re on the edge of policy&quot;.

The ASI formed the primary intellectual force behind the privatisation of state-owned industries during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, and alongside the Centre for Policy Studies and Institute of Economic Affairs advanced a neoliberal approach toward public policy on privatisation, taxation, education and healthcare. A number of the policies presented by organisation were adopted by the administrations of John Major and Tony Blair and members of the ASI have also advised non-United Kingdom governments. Beyond policy development, the organisation advocates free market ideas through the publication and distribution of literature, the promotion of Tax Freedom Day, the hosting of speaker events for students and young people, media appearances and blogging.

The ASI is rated as one of the least transparent think tanks in the United Kingdom in relation to funding and received 3% of its funding from the tobacco industry in 2011.

==History==
===Foundation===

Madsen Pirie and brothers Eamonn and Stuart Butler were students together at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Pirie left in 1974 to work for the Republican Study Committee in Washington, D.C., and then took up a professorship in Philosophy at Hillsdale College. He was joined there by Stuart Butler while Eamonn Butler went to work with Edwin Feulner, who became co-founder and director of the free-market think tank The Heritage Foundation.

After their experience in the United States, they returned to the United Kingdom in 1977 to found their own think tank, called the Adam Smith Institute. After a year, Stuart Butler returned to the United States as Vice President of the Heritage in charge of domestic policy while Eamonn Butler remained with Madsen Pirie as co-directors of the institute.

One of their St Andrews friends, Douglas Mason, who had been active in the university&#x27;s Conservative Association, did his most influential research and writing for the institute. Mason became one of its regular authors.

The ASI&#x27;s Omega Project (1981–1983) led by Peter Young produced a series of 19 papers shadowing each Department of State and advocated such things as the compulsory contracting-out of most local services such as refuse collection, the replacement of much of the welfare state by private insurance and further privatisation of public sector services and industries, including aspects of police services.

===Thatcher&#x27;s inner circle===
The Margaret Thatcher era saw the think tank movement come of age and achieve influence and with the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) and the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the ASI was one of three relied upon by the Thatcher government for policy. Unlike the CPS, which had been established by Thatcher and Keith Joseph; and the IEA, which focused on more theoretical matters, the ASI was well-placed to produce bold and direct policies. Despite this role, the Institute developed an iconoclastic reputation, cynical about politicians, but enthusiastic to engage with them. The institute&#x27;s relationship with Thatcher was not without troubles. Although Madsen Pirie was the architect of much of the privatisation policy, he had no emotional ties to Thatcher, nor did the ASI propose policies on a range of social issues despite its Thatcherite reputation.

The ASI took the view that the market was &quot;more genuinely democratic than the public sector, involving the decisions of far more individuals and at much more frequent intervals&quot;. The Institute published Douglas Mason&#x27;s recommendation that local government rates (the local government tax) should be replaced by a per-capita charge. A version of this was later implemented by the Conservative government introducing the Community Charge in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales in 1990. It brought unpopularity for the Thatcher government and was seen by some as being one of the things that weakened her political hand ahead of her departure from office.

Other policy recommendations which Douglas Mason published with the ASI included the privatisation of the Royal Mail (&quot;The Last Post&quot; − 1991); the introduction of charges in British public libraries (&quot;Ex Libris&quot; – 1986); the privatisation of the Forestry Commission; the complete removal of arts subsidies (&quot;Expounding The Arts&quot; – 1987); and the abolition of restrictions on drinking (&quot;Time To Call Time&quot; – 1986).

===After Thatcher===
In November 1994, the Institute began a review of welfare reform called Operation Underclass, aimed at methods of creating jobs for the long-term unemployed. Some elements of the programme were adopted by the government within months.

The ejection of the Conservative government in 1997 did not have as dramatic an effect on the ASI as some had anticipated. The Institute praised the Blair government&#x27;s welfare-to-work programmes, describing it as &quot;the most successful policy initiative of this century&quot;. The ASI publicly welcomed the news that Labour had implemented the long-held ASI aim of an independent Bank of England, Madsen Pirie gave it a nine out of ten for performance. Eamonn Butler has ascribed this flexibility to who is in power to their role not being &quot;to be political or shout slogans&quot;, but to be &quot;policy engineers&quot;.

The ASI then collaborated with the MORI organisation on a series of opinion polls to measure such things as the goals of young people and students, and public attitudes to state services.

The ASI&#x27;s libertarian label was officially changed to neoliberal on 10 October 2016.

In February 2022, the ASI wrote a paper arguing that the Moon should be privatized to eliminate poverty on Earth. The paper argued that the Moon&#x27;s land should be divided and given to different countries that would then be rented to companies in order to increase economic growth through space tourism and exploration. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prohibits individuals and countries from owning property in space. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the report received an &quot;outraged online reaction&quot;.

=== International work ===
In 1992, the Institute founded a consulting company, Adam Smith International Ltd, which was &quot;charged with overseeing the overseas work of the institute [in] an attempt to capitalise on the growing international trend towards economic liberalization and marketization&quot;. While Eamonn Butler and Madsen Pirie were as of 1998 members of the management board of both organisations, the management teams of Adam Smith International and the Institute are now separate.

== Funding ==
Think tank Transparify ranked the Institute as one of the four least transparent think tanks in the United Kingdom in relation to funding. Transparify&#x27;s report &quot;How Transparent are Think Tanks about Who Funds Them 2016?&quot; rated them as &quot;highly opaque&quot;, one of &quot;a handful of think tanks that refuse to reveal even the identities of their donors&quot;. In 2022, the website Who Funds You? rated the Institute as E, the lowest transparency rating (rating goes from A to E). TobaccoTactics, the website of the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath, details the institute&#x27;s funding by the tobacco industry. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the Institute received three percent of its funding from the tobacco industry in 2011.

=== Investigated for breaches of charities rules ===
In December 2018, the institute, which consists of at least three different legal entities (a British company, a British charity and an American non-profit foundation), was reported to be under investigation by the Charity Commission for improper use of funds. Charities in England and Wales are required to be genuinely independent from other entities, and cannot perform political campaigning. Contributors giving £1,000 a year were offered &quot;opportunities to attend power lunches and patrons dinners with influential figures, including politicians, ministers, journalists and academics.&quot;

== Activities ==
=== Tax Freedom Day ===
The institute publishes the British version of Tax Freedom Day, the day in the year when the average person has earned enough to pay his or her annual tax bill. The Institute calculates the figure by expressing the government&#x27;s take of the economy as a percentage of the year, including all forms of taxation, direct and indirect, national and local.

=== The Next Generation ===
The Liberty League was a United Kingdom student organisation in the early 2010s, was founded by members of the Next Generation Committee (James Lawson, William Hamilton and Anton Howes). It aimed to support classical liberalism. Its annual Freedom Forum conference was transferred to the institute.

== Influence ==

In January 2009, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; and the University of Pennsylvania named the Institute among the top 10 think-tanks in the world outside of the United States. The institute is highly influential in United Kingdom public policy and was &quot;a pioneer of privatisation&quot; in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Early Institute papers proposed the outsourcing of local government services (1980), the fundamentals of the poll tax (1981–1985) and the deregulation and privatisation of transportation (1980). Other influences include the United Kingdom&#x27;s cutting of the highest rate of income tax from 83% to 40% in the late 1980s and its liberalisation of alcohol licensing laws.

The institute has released a series of Roadmap to Reform papers, calling for shifts in public policy in Health, Deregulation and Europe. In 2006, the Institute released a paper calling for a rethink of Britain&#x27;s countryside policy.

According to the &quot;2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), the ASI is ranked number 69 (of 150) of the &quot;Top Think Tanks Worldwide&quot;.

=== Tax reform ===
A 2005 paper by the Institute proposed a flat-rate income tax of 22% for United Kingdom taxpayers, with the above-referenced tax-free personal allowance of £12,000. &quot;City A.M.&quot; editor Allister Heath said of this report that &quot;rarely has a think-tank publication been this influential so quickly. Its arguments have been dissected by the UK Treasury, are well known among the Shadow Treasury Team, have had an influence on some parts of the Liberal Democrats and were even adopted by several minor political parties&quot;. The ASI continues to campaign for a flat tax.

=== Public sector reform ===
==== Education ====
The Education Reform Act 1988 reflected many policy changes proposed by the institute, including increasing representation of parents on state school governing boards, shifting control of state schools from the local authority to the board and head teachers and abolishing fixed school catchment areas.

==== Rail privatisation ====

With its author Kenneth Irvine, the ASI says it pioneered the privatisation of British Rail with private companies competing for franchises on a separately owned national network (The Right Lines – 1987). This policy was enacted by John Major&#x27;s government.

==== Immigration ====
The institute is one of the strongest defenders of immigration.

== Current viewpoints ==
=== Green belt ===
The ASI has written extensively about the effect the green belt has had on house prices by restricting where houses can be built. In its paper &quot;The Green Noose&quot;, the Institute wrote that &quot;simply removing restrictions on land 10 minutes’ walk of a railway station would allow the development of 1 million more homes within the Green Belt surrounding London alone&quot;. The ASI believes that instead of simply putting a blanket ban on building in the areas surrounding cities, planning permission should be granted based on the environmental, historic and scientific value of the land.

=== Rail policy ===
Amid ongoing debate about the railways, the ASI has been an advocate of the privatised system, writing that much of the rise in passenger numbers since privatisation cannot be attributed to other factors. It has called for increased competition through the use of open access operators or having two operators sharing a franchise and competing with each other.

<text>Roscoe Gardner Bartlett Jr. (born June 3, 1926) is an American politician who served a member of the United States House of Representative from 1993 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party and was a member of the Tea Party Caucus. At the end of his tenure in Congress, Bartlett was the second-oldest serving member of the House of Representatives, behind fellow Republican Ralph Hall of Texas.

==Early life and education==
Bartlett was born in Moorland, Kentucky, to Martha Minnick and Roscoe Gardner Bartlett. He completed his early education in a one-room schoolhouse. He attended Columbia Union College (now Washington Adventist University) in Takoma Park, Maryland, affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and graduated in 1947 with a Bachelor of Science in theology and biology and a minor in chemistry. He had intended to be a Seventh-day Adventist minister, but he was considered too young for the ministry after receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the age of 21.

Bartlett was encouraged to attend postgraduate education at the University of Maryland, College Park. He studied anatomy, physiology, and zoology, earning a master&#x27;s degree in physiology in 1948. Bartlett was then hired as a faculty member of the university and taught anatomy, physiology and zoology while working towards his Doctor of Philosophy in physiology, which he earned in 1952. His academic career included lecturing at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, also affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, in Loma Linda, California (1952–1954), and serving as an assistant professor at Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C. from 1954 to 1956.

==Political career==
===Elections===
;1980
In 1980, Bartlett ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate. In the Republican primary, he ranked fourth with 7% of the vote, losing to incumbent Charles Mathias, who won the primary with 55% of the vote.

;1982
In 1982, Bartlett ran for Congress in Maryland&#x27;s 6th congressional district against incumbent Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Beverly Byron. He won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote. In the general election, Byron defeated him 74%–26%.

;1992
Bartlett ran again in the newly redrawn 6th congressional district and won the Republican primary with 42% of the vote. Byron was upset by a somewhat more liberal Democrat, State Delegate Thomas Hattery, in the Democratic primary. Many conservative Democrats switched their support to Bartlett in November, as he defeated Hattery 54%–46%.

;1994–2006
During this time period, Bartlett repeatedly won re-election with at least 56% of the vote.

;2008

According to the &quot;Frederick News-Post&quot;, Bartlett had under-reported property sales by over $1 million since 2004 on his official financial disclosure forms, and made $299,000 in unreported loans in order to sell his daughter&#x27;s home, over which he exercised power of attorney. Bartlett said that the under-reporting was an oversight and that he was a &quot;bit player&quot; in the real estate transactions.

;2010

As the lone Republican in Maryland&#x27;s congressional delegation, Bartlett won reelection in 2010 at the age of 84. On June 1, 2009, Democrat and Iraq war veteran Andrew Duck formally announced a campaign for Congressman Bartlett&#x27;s seat.

;2012

Bartlett&#x27;s district was significantly altered in redistricting plans released in October 2011, which was described as gerrymandering. The new district lines shifted the district slightly to the south, adding some heavily Democratic territory closer to Washington DC.

Specifically, the redistricting plan shifted a mostly Republican section of Frederick County and an even more heavily Republican section of Carroll County to the heavily Democratic 8th district. It also lost heavily Republican sections of Harford and Baltimore counties, as well as another section of Carroll, to the already heavily Republican 1st district. In their place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic section of Montgomery County. While John McCain carried the old 6th with 57 percent of the vote, Barack Obama would have carried the reconfigured 6th with 56 percent of the vote.

Bartlett faced Democrat John Delaney and Libertarian Nickolaus Mueller in his bid for reelection.

In 2012, the Federal Election Commission fined Bartlett $5,000 for repeatedly failing to submit accurate campaign finance disclosure reports. Bartlett hired an accountant to address any outstanding disclosure issues.

When fellow Congressman Todd Akin made inappropriate comments about female biology, Bartlett immediately repudiated them, adding &quot;There is no room in politics for these types of statements...As a human physiologist I know there is no scientific backing to Todd&#x27;s claims.&quot; He said his view on abortion exceptions has been &quot;the same for twenty years. I&#x27;m pro-life, with exceptions for the life of the mother, rape and incest...I&#x27;m so avidly pro-life I&#x27;m against corporal punishment&quot;, later adding that a very small proportion of abortions are a result of rape; however, in 2001 Bartlett had supported a constitutional amendment which did not include the rape and incest exceptions. &quot;The Maryland Democratic Party went after Bartlett&quot;, trying to connect Todd Akin&#x27;s comments to Bartlett.

Bartlett was heavily defeated in the general election by Delaney, taking only 38 percent of the vote to Delaney&#x27;s 59 percent.

===Tenure===

In November 1997, Bartlett was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, which ultimately lead to the impeachment of Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Bartlett voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Bartlett voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (two of which received the needed majority of votes to pass).

In 1993, Bartlett voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.

In August 2011, Bartlett wrote an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling for an end to invasive research on primates. Bartlett, who had previously conducted research on primates in connection with the U.S. space program, joined with Senator Maria Cantwell in introducing the Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act. It is estimated to save the federal government $300 million over the next 10 years, if passed.

Press reports indicate that Bartlett&#x27;s Political Action Committee is named Because All Responsible Taxpayers Like Every Truth Told PAC, or BARTLETT PAC for short.

Press reports indicate Bartlett was instrumental in arranging House hearings on the dangers of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the United States.

Bartlett is against the Senate bill to fund the United States Postal Service with an additional 33 billion dollars, calling it an &quot;irresponsible bailout&quot;—though he does claim to support &quot;... maintaining next day delivery standards in rural areas that would keep the Cumberland mail processing facility open.&quot;

Bartlett believes in the geologic theory of Peak Oil, and predicts that &quot;the end of cheap oil and natural gas is coming and coming fast&quot; as increasing global demand for energy overwhelms production. In 2005, Bartlett established the Congressional Peak Oil Caucus with Rep. Tom Udall of New Mexico. Bartlett has argued that federal revenues from offshore oil and gas production should be invested in developing renewable energies.

At a town hall meeting in September 2012, Bartlett claimed that federal student loans were unconstitutional and that disregarding the Constitution was a &quot;very slippery slope&quot; towards an event like the Holocaust. Bartlett later apologized for his remarks.

<doc id="414565" wikidata="Q972568" url="?curid=414565" title="Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)">
<text>Nicholas Aloysius Adamshock (July 10, 1931 – February 7, 1968), better known as Nick Adams, was an American film and television actor and screenwriter. He was noted for his roles in several Hollywood films during the 1950s and 1960s, including &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;Giant&quot; along with his starring role in the ABC television series &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1959–1961). He also led the cast of several Japanese productions, including &quot;Frankenstein Conquers the World&quot;, &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot;, and &quot;The Killing Bottle&quot;.

Decades after his death from a prescription drug overdose at the age of 36, his widely publicized friendships with James Dean and Elvis Presley would stir speculation about both his private life and the circumstances of his death. In an &quot;AllMovie&quot; synopsis for Adams&#x27;s last film, reviewer Dan Pavlides wrote, &quot;Plagued by personal excesses, he will be remembered just as much for what he could have done in cinema as what he left behind.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Adams was born as Nicholas Aloysius Adamshock in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania to Catherine (Kutz) and Peter Adamshock, an anthracite coal miner; both his parents were of Ukrainian ancestry. In 1958, he told columnist Hedda Hopper, &quot;We lived in those little company houses — they were terrible. We had to buy from the company store and were always in debt and could never leave.&quot; After a mining accident, Adamshock&#x27;s father quit his job as a miner and the family moved to Jersey City.

Although a successful athlete at Henry Snyder High School, Adamschock failed to get a part in the school play when he was a senior. Adamshock&#x27;s friends teased him about his acting ambitions. &quot;Everybody thought I was crazy,&quot; he recalled. &quot;My father said, &#x27;Nick, get a trade, be a barber or something.&#x27; I said, &#x27;But, Pop, I want to do something where I can make lots of money. You can&#x27;t make lots of money with just a trade.&#x27;&quot; After a year of unpaid acting in New York, he hitchhiked to Los Angeles.

==Hollywood career==
===Struggling actor===

Adamshock&#x27;s earliest reported paid acting job in Los Angeles under the name &quot;Nick Adams&quot; was a stage role at the Las Palmas Theater in a comedy called &quot;Mr. Big Shot&quot;. Although he was paid about $60 a week, Adams had to pay $175 for membership in Actors&#x27; Equity Association. He also earned $25 one night at the Mocambo nightclub, filling in for Pearl Bailey who had fallen ill. Eight years later, Hedda Hopper told Adams she recalled writing about him at the time; and he replied by reciting back to her, &quot;Nick Adams, gas station attendant from New Jersey, did an impersonation of Jimmy Cagney and a scene from &quot;Glass Menagerie&quot;.&quot; 

After three years of struggle and optimistic self-promotion, his first film role came in 1951, an uncredited one-liner as a Western Union delivery boy in George Seaton&#x27;s &quot;Somebody Loves Me&quot; (1952). This allowed him to join the Screen Actors Guild, but he was unable to find steady acting work, even when &quot;creatively&quot; claiming he had appeared with Jack Palance in &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot; in New York. Undaunted, Adams joined a theater workshop run by Arthur Kennedy. In January 1952, Adams enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard during the Korean War, serving as an Electrician&#x27;s Mate. He served until 1955, attaining the rank of Petty Officer Second Class and was awarded the National Defense and Korean War Service Medals.

===Supporting actor===
About two years later, in June 1954, his ship docked in Long Beach harbor and, after a brash audition for director John Ford during which Adams did impressions of James Cagney and other celebrities while dressed in his Coast Guard uniform, he took his accumulated leave and appeared as Seaman Reber in the 1955 film version of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. Adams then completed his military service, returned to Los Angeles and, at the age of 23, based on his work in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, secured a powerful agent, and signed with Warner Bros.

Adams had a small role (as Chick) in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). Also that year Adams played the role of &quot;Bomber&quot; the paper boy in the widely popular film adaptation of &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), which was mostly filmed on location in Kansas, and starred William Holden, Kim Novak, and Susan Strasberg. He was not perceived by casting directors as tall or handsome enough for leading roles, but during the late 1950s, Adams had supporting roles in several successful television productions, including one episode of &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; (1958) starring Steve McQueen, and films such as &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; (1956), &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (1958), &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958), and &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959).

===James Dean===
Adams initially may have met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams spent three years in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, &quot;Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together — almost like the gang we portrayed — but Jimmy and Corey Allen ... were not a part of that.&quot; When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, &quot;I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends ... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon.&quot; Following Dean&#x27;s 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean&#x27;s lines for the film &quot;Giant&quot; (these are in Jett Rink&#x27;s speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean&#x27;s fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean&#x27;s grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean&#x27;s affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, &quot;I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but I kept on racing ... nowhere.&quot;

===Elvis Presley===
Adams&#x27;s widely publicized friendship with Elvis Presley began in 1956 on the set of Presley&#x27;s film &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; during the second day of shooting. Presley had admired James Dean, and when the singer arrived in Hollywood, he was encouraged by studio executives to be seen with some of the &quot;hip&quot; new young actors there. Meanwhile, his manager Colonel Tom Parker was worried that Elvis&#x27; new Hollywood acquaintances might influence Presley and even tell him what they were paying their managers and agents (a fraction of what Presley was paying Parker). Elaine Dundy called Parker a &quot;master manipulator&quot; who used Nick Adams and others in the entourage (including Parker&#x27;s own brother-in-law Bitsy Mott) to counter possible subversion against him and control Elvis&#x27; movements. She later wrote a scathing characterization of Adams:
... Brash struggling young actor whose main scheme to further his career was to hitch his wagon to a star, the first being James Dean, about whose friendship he was noisily boastful ... this made it easy for Parker to suggest that Nick be invited to join Elvis&#x27; growing entourage of paid companions, and for Nick to accept ... following Adams&#x27; hiring, there appeared a newspaper item stating that Nick and Parker were writing a book on Elvis together.

Dundy also wrote, &quot;Of all Elvis&#x27; new friends, Nick Adams, by background and temperament the most insecure, was also his closest.&quot; Adams was Dennis Hopper&#x27;s roommate during this period, and the three reportedly socialized together, with Presley &quot;hanging out more and more with Nick and his friends&quot; and glad his manager &quot;liked Nick&quot;. Decades later, Kathleen Tracy recalled Adams often met Presley backstage or at Graceland, where Elvis often asked Adams &quot;to stay over on nights&quot;: &quot;He and Elvis would go motorcycle riding late at night and stay up until all hours talking about the pain of celebrity&quot; and enjoying prescription drugs.

Almost 40 years later, writer Peter Guralnick wrote that Presley found it &quot;good running around with Nick ... there was always something happening, and the hotel suite was like a private clubhouse where you needed to know the secret password to get in and he got to change the password every day.&quot; Presley&#x27;s girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was always talking about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis&#x27; attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley&#x27;s own mother even commented about Adams, &quot;He sure is a pushy little fellow&quot;.

As with Dean, Adams capitalized on his association with Presley, publishing an account of their friendship in May 1957. In August 1958, after the death of Elvis&#x27;s mother Gladys, Parker wrote in a letter, &quot;Nicky came out to be with Elvis last Week was so very kind of him to be there with his friend.&quot;

&quot;The Rebel and the King&quot; by Nick Adams is a first-person account written by Adams about his friendship with Presley. The manuscript was written in 1956 by Nick during Presley&#x27;s eight days in Memphis when the singer returned home for his big Tupelo homecoming. The manuscript was discovered 45 years later by Adams&#x27;s daughter and initially published in 2012.

===&quot;The Rebel&quot;===

In 1959, Adams starred in the ABC series &quot;The Rebel&quot; playing the character Johnny Yuma, a wandering, ex-Confederate, journal-keeping, sawed-off shotgun toting &quot;trouble-shooter&quot; in the old American west. He is credited as a co-creator of &quot;The Rebel&quot;, but he had no role in writing the pilot or any of the series&#x27; episodes. Adams had asked his friend Andrew J. Fenady to write the pilot as a starring vehicle for him. The series&#x27; only recurring character, publicized as a &quot;Reconstruction beatnik&quot;, was played by Adams. He reportedly consulted with John Wayne for tips on how to play the role. Adams wanted Presley to sing the theme song for &quot;The Rebel&quot;, but the show&#x27;s producer wanted Johnny Cash. Adams recorded the song &quot;Tired And Lonely Rebel&quot; in 1960. Guest stars appearing on the series during its two-year run included Dan Blocker, Johnny Cash, Leonard Nimoy, Tex Ritter, and Robert Vaughn. A total of 76 half-hour episodes were filmed before the series was cancelled in 1961. Reruns were syndicated for several years. Adams went back to TV and film work, along with a role in the short-lived but critically successful television series &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;.

===&quot;Twilight of Honor&quot;===
Adams was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as an unlikable murder suspect in the film &quot;Twilight of Honor&quot; (1963), which featured the film debuts of both Linda Evans and Joey Heatherton. He campaigned heavily for the award, spending over $8,000 on ads in trade magazines, but many of his strongest scenes had been cut from the movie, and he lost to Melvyn Douglas.

===Toho Studios and career decline===
In 1964, Adams had a leading role opposite Nancy Malone in an episode (&quot;Fun and Games&quot;) of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. A review of this episode written over three decades later would characterize him as an &quot;underrated actor&quot;. By this time Adams&#x27;s career was stalling. He had high hopes his co-starring performance with Robert Conrad in &quot;Young Dillinger&quot; (1964) would be critically acclaimed, but the project had low production values, and both critics and audiences rejected the film. Also that year, Adams guest-starred in an episode of the short-lived CBS drama &quot;The Reporter&quot;.

In 1965, after publicly insisting he would never work in films produced outside the U.S., Adams began accepting parts in Japanese science fiction monster movies (&quot;kaiju eiga&quot;). He landed major roles in two science fiction epics from Toho Studios in Chiyoda, Tokyo. His first Japanese movie was &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot;, in which he played Dr. James Bowen, a radiologist working in Hiroshima who encounters a new incarnation of the Frankenstein monster. Adams next starred in the sixth Godzilla film, &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; (known in the U.S. as &quot;Monster Zero&quot;), in which he played Astronaut Glenn, journeying to the newly discovered Planet X. In both films, his character had a love interest with characters portrayed by actress Kumi Mizuno. On the set of &quot;Monster Zero&quot;, Adams and co-star Yoshio Tsuchiya (who played the villainous Controller of Planet X) reportedly got along well and played jokes on each other. Adams made three films in Japan between 1965 and 1966. Adams&#x27; final film for Toho was the fifth and final film in the &quot;International Secret Police&quot; Series which included &quot;Key of Keys&quot; Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (国際秘密警察 鍵の鍵, International Secret Police: Key of Keys), which was the basis for the Woody Allen scripted spoof &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot; (1966). The English title for this final film was &quot;The Killing Bottle&quot;, Toho shot the film in Japanese with Adams doing his lines in English as in the previous films. An English dub was commissioned by Henry G. Saperstein, and produced by Titra Studios. This English version was never released in the U.S., but there were rumors of the English dub being released in Yugoslavia. The most interesting aspect of this film, is that Adams actually performed his own fights scenes using Kenpo, a style he had been learning under Senior Grand Master Ed Parker in the States. Previous to this time, he also co-starred with Boris Karloff in &quot;Die, Monster, Die!&quot; (1965), a Gothic horror–sci fi movie filmed in England.

===1967: TV episodes and low-budget films===

In early 1967, Disney released &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, a Civil War drama told from a southern perspective with Adams in the role of a cruel Union army sergeant. Adams guest-starred in five episodes of four TV series that year, including an installment of his friend Robert Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, an appearance in &quot;Combat!&quot; and two episodes of &quot;Hondo&quot; (a short-lived western which also had an ex-Confederate theme). Throughout 1967 and early 1968, he also worked in three low-budget films. One of these was &quot;Mission Mars&quot; (1968) which has been described as &quot;rarely seen, and utterly dreadful.&quot; Adams&#x27;s costume for this movie included an off-the-shelf motorcycle helmet. Reacting to &quot;Mission Mars&quot; over 30 years later, SciFi reviewer Gary Westfahl wrote, &quot;The only quality that Adams could persuasively project on film was a desperate desire to be popular, to be liked ... which helps to explain why Adams got his foot in many doors.&quot; Adams&#x27;s last U.S. production was a movie filmed in Iowa called &quot;Fever Heat&quot;. His last film appearance was in the little-seen Spanish-language western &quot;Los Asesinos&quot;, filmed in Mexico City, Mexico.

==Marriage and children==

Adams married former child actress Carol Nugent in 1959. Nugent had appeared in an episode of &quot;The Rebel&quot;. They had two children, Allyson and Jeb Stuart Adams. Jeb was a child actor, then gave up acting, and is now a successful realtor in Ventura County, California. Allyson was a film director, but is now a costume designer and activist. 

Sometimes acrimonious marital problems reportedly interfered with his ability to get lucrative acting parts after 1963. While promoting &quot;Young Dillinger&quot; during a television appearance on &quot;The Les Crane Show&quot; in early 1965, Adams &quot;shocked&quot; the viewing audience with an announcement that he was leaving his wife, seemingly without telling her first. The couple publicly announced a reconciliation a week later, but his career and personal life following this episode have been characterized as a &quot;tragic freefall&quot;.

Adams and actress Kumi Mizuno may have had a short affair while he was working in Japan. &quot;That&#x27;s one of the reasons my parents were divorced,&quot; his daughter, playwright Allyson Lee Adams, later said. &quot;My dad had a penchant for becoming infatuated with his leading ladies. It was a way for him to take on the role he was playing at the time.&quot; Rumors of a romance between the two were common occurrence until Mizuno denied it during an interview in 1996.

By July 1965, Adams and Nugent were legally separated; Nugent filed for divorce in September. The following month, while Adams was in Japan, Nugent was granted a divorce and custody of the children. In January 1966, Adams and Nugent announced another reconciliation on &quot;Bill John&#x27;s Hollywood Star Notebook&quot;, a local television show. However, in November 1966, Nugent resumed the divorce proceedings and obtained a restraining order against him, alleging Adams was &quot;prone to fits of temper&quot;, and in an affidavit, charged he had &quot;choked her, struck her and threatened to kill her during the past few weeks.&quot; On January 20, 1967, Adams was waiting for a court hearing to start when he was served with a $110,000 defamation suit by Nugent&#x27;s boyfriend, Paul Rapp, who later married Nugent. Nevertheless, nine days later he was granted temporary custody of the children. His son Jeb Adams later recalled, &quot;He saw it as a competition, basically, more than anything of getting custody of us. But, a matter of a week or two later, he gave us back to my mom.&quot; Nugent later regained legal custody of the children.

==Death==

After finishing &quot;Los Asesinos&quot; (1968), produced by Luis Enrique Vergara and filmed in Mexico, Adams bought a plane ticket with his own money and flew to Rome, Italy, to co-star with Aldo Ray in a science fiction/horror movie called &quot;Murder in the Third Dimension&quot;, but when he got there, he found the project had been dropped. Susan Strasberg, who had worked with him 13 years earlier on the hit film &quot;Picnic&quot; and was living in Italy, encountered a thoroughly demoralized Adams in a Rome bar.

On the night of February 7, 1968, his lawyer and friend, ex-LAPD officer Ervin Roeder, drove to the actor&#x27;s house at 2126 El Roble Lane in Beverly Hills to check on him after a missed dinner appointment. Seeing a light on and his car in the garage, Roeder broke through a window and discovered Adams in his upstairs bedroom, slumped dead against a wall.

During the autopsy Dr. Thomas Noguchi found enough paraldehyde, sedatives and other drugs in the body &quot;to cause instant unconsciousness.&quot; The death certificate lists &quot;paraldehyde and promazine intoxication&quot; as the immediate cause of death, along with the notation &quot;accident; suicide; undetermined.&quot; During the 1960s, drug interaction warnings were not so prominent as they later would be, and the American Medical Association has subsequently warned these two types of drugs should never be taken together.

The death of Nick Adams has been cited in articles and books about Hollywood&#x27;s unsolved mysteries along with speculation by a few of his acquaintances that he was murdered (according to author David Kulczyk, Adams was apparently planning to write a tell-all book revealing many sexual secrets of Hollywood names) and claims no trace of paraldehyde (a liquid sedative often given to alcoholics at the time and one of two drugs attributed to his death) was ever found in his home. However, Adams&#x27;s brother Andrew had become a medical doctor and prescribed the sedative to him. Moreover, a story in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported stoppered bottles with prescription labels were found in the medicine cabinet near the upstairs bedroom where Adams&#x27;s body was discovered. Through the years, his children offered speculation ranging from murder to accidental death, the latter perhaps caused by Roeder while trying to calm the actor&#x27;s nerves with an unintentionally lethal combination of alcohol and prescription drugs (although the autopsy found no alcohol in Adams&#x27;s blood). Actor Robert Conrad, Adams&#x27;s best friend, consistently maintained that the death was accidental.

Carol Adams is listed as Adams&#x27;s spouse on his death certificate, evidence the divorce had not become final when the actor died. She and the children were living only a few blocks from his recently-rented house on El Roble Lane.

Adams&#x27;s remains were interred at Saints Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic Cemetery in Berwick, Pennsylvania. The backside of his gravestone, which bears a silhouette of Adams wearing the Civil War-era cap from his television series, is inscribed &quot;Nick Adams — The Rebel — Actor of Hollywood Screens&quot;.

Decades later, Adams&#x27;s highly publicized life and death at a young age, his friendships with cultural icons such as James Dean and Elvis Presley, and his reported drug consumption made his private life the subject of many reports and assertions by some writers who have claimed Adams may have been gay or bisexual. One of the earliest published mentions on this overall topic was made by gossip columnist Rona Barrett in her 1974 autobiography, in which she made no assertion Adams was homosexual or bisexual but claimed Adams had told her, along with a &quot;whole roomful of people,&quot; that he wasn&#x27;t making it because no one in Hollywood&#x27;s upper stratosphere would accept his wife. Barrett called it &quot;untrue. She was one of the most refreshing wives in the entire community&quot; and went on to say Adams &quot;had become the companion to a group of salacious homosexuals&quot; who flattered the actor, which affected his judgment and caused him to blame Carol. Hollywood biographer Lawrence J. Quirk claimed Mike Connolly (a gay gossip columnist for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; from 1951 to 1966) &quot;would put the make on the most prominent young actors, including Robert Francis, Guy Madison, Anthony Perkins, Nick Adams, and James Dean.&quot; According to &quot;American Film&quot; (1986), &quot;Nick Adams, who was ...gay, was the butt of anti-gay humor in &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;&quot;.

Some writers later called Adams a &quot;Hollywood hustler&quot; or a &quot;street hustler&quot;. One journalist also refers to Adams as a &quot;pool hustler&quot; who made money in pool halls when he was a teenager in New Jersey and later while struggling to make ends meet during his early years in Hollywood.

===Friendship with Dean and Presley===
It is uncertain whether James Dean and Adams met before his service in the United States Coast Guard (1952–1955) and subsequent role in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). In his 1986 gossip book about gay Hollywood, &quot;Conversations with My Elders&quot;, Boze Hadleigh claimed actor Sal Mineo told him in 1972, &quot;I didn&#x27;t hear it from Jimmy (James Dean), who was sort of awesome to me when we did Rebel, but Nick told me they had a big affair.&quot; According to Presley biographer Albert Goldman, &quot;Nick Adams ingratiated himself with James Dean precisely as he would do a year or so later with Elvis. He offered himself to the shy, emotionally contorted and rebellious Dean, as a friend, a guide, a boon companion, a homosexual lover – whatever role or service Dean required.&quot; Journalist, screenwriter and author of books about Hollywood, John Gregory Dunne wrote that &quot;James Dean was bisexual, as were Nick Adams and Sal Mineo.&quot; According to Eric Braun, &quot;Elvis was attracted by Adams&#x27; outgoing personality and the young actors caused quite a stir, cruising round Los Angeles with Natalie Wood, Russ Tamblyn and others on their Hondas.&quot; In 2005, Byron Raphael and Presley biographer Alanna Nash wrote that Adams may have &quot;swung both ways&quot; like &quot;Adams&#x27;s good pal (and Elvis&#x27;s idol) James Dean. Tongues wagged that Elvis and Adams were getting it on.&quot;

===Studio-arranged dates===
Adams regularly dated actresses with whom he made movies. During the mid-1950s, photographs of him with actress Natalie Wood were widely publicized in fan magazines. &quot;Modern Screen&quot; wrote at the time &quot;their relationship has been mostly for fun&quot; and they shared &quot;a tendency toward moodiness and unpredictability.&quot; The magazine also reported they had given joint interviews &quot;in which they admitted they adored each other&quot; and &quot;they even came terribly close to getting married&quot; in Las Vegas. The same article also remarked that on one of their trips they &quot;posed for innumerable publicity photographs — that was the real reason for the trip — &quot; and &quot;Right now, both Nick and Natalie are inclined to deny the whole Las Vegas episode.&quot; In his 2004 biography &quot;Natalie Wood: A Life&quot; biographer and screenwriter Gavin Lambert wrote in passing, Wood&#x27;s &quot;first studio-arranged date with a gay or bisexual actor had been with Nick Adams.&quot; In his biography of gay Hollywood agent Henry Willson, Robert Hofler deals with the rise of the studio star system, in which several actors spent time on the homosexual casting couch and dated girls or even entered into sham marriages in order to cover their homosexuality. &quot;In the Henry Willson date pool,&quot; the author says, &quot;Nick Adams was one client, among many, who glommed on to Natalie Wood to get his picture taken.&quot; Suzanne Finstad cites actor Jack Grinnage, one of the gang members in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, about Nick Adams&#x27;s and Dennis Hopper&#x27;s reasons &quot;for getting close to Natalie. &#x27;I remember being in Dennis&#x27; dressing room with Nick and Natalie ... I don&#x27;t know which one of them said this — it was Nick or Dennis — but he said, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna hang on to her bra straps.&quot; Meaning up the career ladder.&#x27; Natalie&#x27;s tutor, who knew Hopper and Adams off set, said, &#x27;Both of those two guys were all over her ... because they could see that this movie was going to be a big thing for Natalie ... they were game for anything in order to be noticed and to get ahead in the business.&#x27; &quot;

Actress Olive Sturgess relates: &quot;When Nick and I went out, it was a casual thing —no great love or anything like that ... I thought he was very troubled ... You could feel he was troubled. It was the manner he had —that was the way he was in real life, always brooding ... When we went out, it was never on his motorcycle! That&#x27;s one trick he couldn&#x27;t pull on me. We always went in a car!&quot;

===Lack of confirmation===
Because of morality clauses in studio contracts, along with practical marketing concerns, most homosexual actors during the 1950s and 1960s were forced to be discreet about their sexuality. However, Adams was known in Hollywood for embellishing and inventing stories about his show business experiences and long tried to capitalize on his associations with James Dean and Elvis Presley. In a brief biographical article, journalist Bill Kelly wrote Adams &quot;became James Dean&#x27;s closest pal, although Nick was straight and Dean was bisexual.&quot; Moreover, there are neither court documents (such as from the long and drawn-out divorce and child custody proceedings between him and his wife), nor personal letters from Adams, nor directly attributable statements by any alleged male lovers, to support the assertions.

<text>New Milton is a market town and civil parish in the New Forest district, in southwest Hampshire, England. To the north is in the New Forest and to the south the coast at Barton-on-Sea. The town is equidistant between Lymington and Christchurch, away. In 2011 it had a population of 19,969.

==History==
New Milton dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, and encompasses Old Milton, Barton on Sea, Ashley, Bashley, and Wootton. It is recorded as having a population of 25,717 in the 2011 census.

===Milton===
The manor of (&quot;Mildeltune&quot;) is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 and literally means &quot;Middle farm.&quot; It was part of the lands belonging to Hugh de Port, and the estate was held from him by William Chernet. The Chernet family maintained possession of Milton into the 13th century, although lesser families were managing the estate on their behalf. The most important of these were the Chaucombe (or Chalcombe) family, who were probably the first people to build a church in Milton in the mid 13th century. In 1303, Thomas de Chaucombe was given permission to hold a weekly market on Tuesdays at Milton, as well as an annual fair on the feast day of Mary Magdalene, but this attempt to create a market town seems to have failed.

From 1365 to 1565, the manor was in the possession of the Tyrrell family. The manor passed through various hands in subsequent centuries. The last significant owners were the Bursey family in the 19th century, and in the 1890s the remaining lands of the estate were subdivided and sold. In close proximity to Milton was the manor of Fernhill. In the Domesday book, it was held by Nigel from Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. In the 15th century, John Fromond, the owner of this scattered estate, willed the lands to Winchester College, in whose hands the estate remained down to the 19th century. Another estate called &quot;Gore&quot; appeared by the 15th century, and still survives (partially) as a farm to the west of the town.
The traditional village centre of Milton was just south of the church. Up to the 1960s, moated earthworks were still visible next to the road known as Moat Lane. Excavations of these earthworks in 1956 revealed a series of peasant enclosures and hut remains dating from the 9th to the 12th century, but no evidence of a manorial farmstead was found. The parish church of Milton is dedicated to Mary Magdalene and consists of a chancel with vestry, a nave and a western tower. The medieval church was pulled down and replaced around 1830, although the tower is of an earlier 17th century date. In 1835, a Church of England National School was founded on an island of land near the village green, where children were taught until just after World War I. In 1881, the population of the entire Milton parish was only 1489 people, and Milton was still a small village. The location of the village on the main Christchurch to Lymington road (now the A337) meant that there were two coaching inns - &quot;The Wheatsheaf&quot; and &quot;The George&quot; - the former of which is still operating.

===New Milton===
In March 1888 New Milton railway station was opened, which is still in operation today. A new town developed, which expanded rapidly with the coming of the railway and the name New Milton was used for the first time and can originally be traced back to the Post Office that stood opposite the railway station. In 1895, the owner of the Post Office, Emma Newhook, commissioned a sign, which read - &quot;New Milton Sub Post Office&quot; to differentiate it from the post office in Old Milton. This was officially accepted in 1896, and so the name New Milton caught on. Much of the local farmland has been developed, first in the 1960s for commuter housing and again in the 1970s for small industrial/trade units. There is a mix of housing from cottages on the outskirts to more modern, urban housing in the central area. Milton village subsequently became known as Old Milton (renamed on Ordnance Survey maps by 1970) and lies between New Milton and Barton on Sea.

There are few notable architectural points of interest in the local area. However, a distinctive row of Coast Guard Cottages is to be found in Barton Lane, Barton on Sea; these were built at the end of the nineteenth century by the Government of the day to house armed guards to try to stop the smuggling that was rife at the time. The Barton on Sea-to-Mudeford coastline was renowned for smuggling with many of the offshore seaways and routes to shore being named after well known local smuggling families. It was in this context that Frederick Marryat, author of &quot;The Children of the New Forest&quot;, was sent on patrol here as a young naval lieutenant in 1821, to watch over traffic from the sheltered Christchurch Bay area. Britain&#x27;s first reinforced concrete bridge was built in 1901 just outside New Milton at Chewton. There was an earlier experiment in building with this material in its unreinforced form at Sway (Sway Tower). Also built in 1900 was the Tudor style water tower, in Osborne Road. It has a staircase, a turret, slit windows and battlements. It is an orange-red colour, from locally cut and finished bricks.

The Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Lourdes was completed in 1927 and expanded in 1951.
On 23 August 1940, 8 August 1942 and 22 January 1943 bombing raids were carried out upon New Milton by the German Luftwaffe. The town&#x27;s water tower was suggested as the target. During the Second World War, New Milton housed evacuees and was a transit station for soldiers going to the battlefields. It also had an army hospital which co-served unwell American airmen based at the nearby airfields at Lymington and Holmsley.

The Memorial Centre in Whitefield Road commemorates those who died in the raids, as well as townspeople who have died more recently. Bricks can be purchased for inscription and insertion into the wall of the Memorial Room, which stands to the left of the front door and contains mementos saved from the original building, which was destroyed by fire in the 1970s.

==Barton on Sea==

Once a coastal village, Barton on Sea is today in the civil parish. During the First World War, Barton Court Hotel became a convalescent home for Indian servicemen and this is commemorated by an obelisk in the village.

While Barton is a common English place-name, the etymology of &quot;Barton-on-Sea&quot; is unique. It means &quot;Beorma&#x27;s Farm&quot;, and appears twice in the Domesday Book, as &quot;Bermintune&quot; and as &quot;Burmintune&quot;.

The coast at Barton on Sea is well known for its geological content, being home to many fossils in the Barton geological beds. The cliff tops are home to a golf course. A cliff-top path runs between Barton and the village of Milford on Sea. From there, the Solent Way stretches to Emsworth, on the West Sussex border.

==Ashley==

To the east of New Milton is the village of Ashley, which also has a history dating back to the Domesday Book. Today Ashley is effectively a suburb of New Milton, albeit with its own shops, churches, and primary schools. In the late 15th century, the manor of Ashley was joined with part of another manor northeast of the parish called Arnewood, and the combined estate became known as Ashley Arnewood. The estate of Ashley Arnewood has long since disappeared, but the name Arnewood still lives on in the name of New Milton&#x27;s secondary school (The Arnewood School), and the name of one of the health centres.

==Activities==
Tourist attractions include the Sammy Miller Motorcycle Museum on the corner of Stem Lane, a prominent collection of motorcycles and accompanying memorabilia.

The Forest Arts Centre is at the end of Old Milton Road. It comprises several exhibition and activity rooms, a bar area and the main 150-seat studio theatre. It hosts a wide range of performances, including multi-genre music, theatre, comedy, dance, films, literature - as well as putting on an array of activities and workshops for people in the community of all ages.

The Memorial Centre also hosts various activities, including painting, dancing, indoor bowls, yoga, model car racing, and the Decorative and Fine Arts Society. It contains a large function rooms, seating 350, with a raised stage. It also has two further rooms for hire upstairs, and a platform lift for disabled access. The 2010s formed Friends group is promoting involvement of local schools and businesses and is currently refurbishing the centre to make it more attractive to hirers.

<text>Haroun Tazieff (11 May 1914 – 2 February 1998) was a Franco-Belgian volcanologist and geologist. He was a famous cinematographer of volcanic eruptions and lava flows, and the author of several books on volcanoes. He was also a government adviser and French cabinet minister. He also served in the Belgian resistance during World War II.

==Early life==
His parents met and married in 1906 while they were both students in Brussels. They later returned to Warsaw, where their first son, Salvator, died at two months and where Haroun was born. His father, Sabir, was a Muslim medical doctor, of Tatar descent and his mother, Zenita Iliyasovna Klupta, was a Polish Jewish chemist and doctor of natural science and holder of a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science. His father was conscripted into the Russian Army and died during the First World War, a fact that did not reach the family until 1919. In 1917 Haroun emigrated to Brussels with his widowed mother.

Haroun received a degree in agronomy in Gembloux in 1938, and another degree in geology at the University of Liège in 1944.

==Career==
Haroun Tazieff participated in the first detailed exploration of the &quot;Saint-Martin&quot; La Verna cave system in the French Pyrenees. In 1952, while he was filming Marcel Loubens&#x27; ascent of the Pierre-Saint-Martin rock face, the cable of the hoist broke and Loubens fell over 80 meters. Loubens died 36 hours later but his body could only be recovered from the cave in 1954.
He became famous in France after publishing a book entitled, &quot;Le Gouffre de la Pierre Saint-Martin&quot; in 1952.

He directed the documentary movie &quot;Le volcan interdit&quot; (1966) about the Nyiragongo Mountain in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which he was the first to climb in 1948.

The &quot;National Geographic&quot; film, &quot;The Violent Earth&quot;, was based on Tazieff&#x27;s expeditions to the volcanoes Mount Etna on Sicily in 1971 and Mount Nyiragongo in 1972. In these expeditions he attempted, unsuccessfully, to descend into the active lava lake in order to collect samples — something he had managed to achieve on a previous expedition in 1959.

He was a Secretary of state in France in the 1980s, in charge of protection against major risks.

Tazieff died in 1998 and was buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris.

<text>Elijah Eugene Cummings (January 18, 1951October 17, 2019) was an American politician and civil rights advocate who served in the United States House of Representatives for from 1996 until his death in 2019, when he was succeeded by his predecessor Kweisi Mfume. The district he represented included over half of the city of Baltimore, including most of the majority-black precincts of Baltimore County, and most of Howard County, Maryland. A member of the Democratic Party, Cummings previously served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1983 to 1996.

Cummings served as the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform from January 2019 until his death in October of the same year.

== Early life, education, and career ==
Cummings was born on January 18, 1951, in Baltimore, son of Ruth Elma () and Robert Cummings. His parents were sharecroppers. He was the third child of seven. When he was 11 years old, Cummings and some friends worked to integrate a segregated swimming pool in South Baltimore.

Cummings graduated with honors from Baltimore City College high school in 1969. He then attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he served in the student government as sophomore class president, student government treasurer, and later student government president. He became a member of the Phi Beta Kappa society and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science.

Cummings graduated from law school at the University of Maryland School of Law, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1976, and was admitted to the bar in Maryland later that year. He practiced law for 19 years before first being elected to the United States House of Representatives in the 1996 election.

For 14 years, Cummings served in the Maryland House of Delegates. His predecessor, Lena King Lee, raised funds and campaigned for him; years later, Cummings credited her with launching his political career. In the Maryland General Assembly, he served as Chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and was the first African American in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tempore.

Cummings also served on several boards and commissions, both in and out of Baltimore. Those include SEED Schools of Maryland Board of Directors and the University of Maryland Law School Board of Advisors. He served on numerous Maryland boards and commissions including the Board of Visitors to the United States Naval Academy and the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel. He was an honorary member of the Baltimore Zoo Board of Trustees.

In addition to his speaking engagements, he wrote a biweekly column for the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; newspaper.

Elijah Cummings was a member of Phi Beta Sigma and a Prince Hall Mason.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
** Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials
* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (Chair)
** Subcommittee on Domestic Policy.
** Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Post Office, and District of Columbia.
* Select Committee on Benghazi (Ranking Minority Member 114th Congress)

In December 2010, Edolphus Towns announced that he would not seek the position of ranking minority member of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress, even though his seniority and service as chair would typically result in his filling this post. Reportedly, Towns withdrew because of a lack of support from Nancy Pelosi who feared that he would not be a sufficiently aggressive leader of Democrats in an anticipated struggle with incoming committee chair Republican Darrell Issa. Reportedly, the White House also wanted Towns to be replaced. Cummings defeated Carolyn Maloney in a vote of the House Democratic Caucus.

In his role as chair of the Oversight Committee, Cummings presided over the first public testimony by President Trump&#x27;s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and was a leading figure in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Carolyn Maloney was named acting chair by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and won the subsequent election in the Democratic caucus to serve as permanent chair.

=== Caucus memberships ===
* Task Force on Health Care Reform
* Co-founder and Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Drug Policy
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Afterschool Caucuses

Cummings was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 108th United States Congress.

Cummings received praise following the congressional panel hearings on steroids in 2008. While investigating the use of steroids in sports, the panel called numerous baseball players to testify, including former single season home run record holder Mark McGwire. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was &quot;taking the Fifth&quot;, referring to the Fifth Amendment. McGwire responded by saying, &quot;I am here to talk about the future, not about the past.&quot; The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.

=== Legislation ===
Cummings introduced the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, a bipartisan bill signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in December 2014. The bill, which Cummings co-sponsored with Representative Darrell Issa, (R-California), is a set of amendments to the Federal Records Act and Presidential Records Act. Among other provisions, the bill modernizes the definition of a federal record to expressly include electronic documents.

He supported the Smart Savings Act, a bill that would make the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target date asset allocation investment fund (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund). Cummings called the bill a &quot;commonsense change&quot; and argued that the bill &quot;will enable workers to take full advantage of a diversified fund designed to yield higher returns&quot;.

He introduced the All Circuit Review Extension Act, a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any U.S. circuit court of appeals, instead of only the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Cummings said that this program is important to extend because it &quot;allows whistleblowers to file appeals where they live rather than being limited to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals&quot;. He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has &quot;an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases&quot;.

In remarks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Cummings declared: &quot;Our party does not just believe, but understands, that Black Lives Matter. But we also recognize that our community and our law enforcement work best when they work together.&quot;

===Tenure===

Rep. Cummings was shown to be very passionate and dedicated in his beliefs, and could often be seen becoming emotional in public as a result. Cummings was seemingly very agreeable as well. According to many, Cummings would often befriend members of the Republican Party, and was highly respected by both sides of the aisle.

== Political campaigns ==

The five-term Congressman for Maryland&#x27;s 7th congressional district, Kweisi Mfume, resigned in February 1996 to take the presidency of the NAACP. Cummings won a crowded twenty-seven-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district—with 37.5% of the vote. In the special election, he defeated Republican Kenneth Kondner with over 80 percent of the vote. He defeated Kondner again in November by a similar margin to win the seat in his own right.

He was reelected 11 more times in the contests which followed, never dropping below 69 percent of the vote. He ran unopposed in 2006.
===Obama campaign===
Early in 2007, Cummings began campaigning for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential bid, attempting to solidify Obama&#x27;s support in the African American community. Early in 2008, Obama remained relatively unknown and Congressional Black Caucus support was split with Hillary Clinton. Cummings traveled extensively to campaign for Obama.

== Electoral history ==
: Results 1996–2018
== Personal life ==
Cummings lived in the Madison Park community in Baltimore and was an active member of the New Psalmist Baptist Church. He married Joyce Matthews, with whom he had a daughter, Jennifer J. Cummings. He had a son and a daughter, Adia Cummings, from other relationships. He married Maya Rockeymoore Cummings in 2009, who was elected chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party in December 2018.

In June 2011, his nephew Christopher Cummings, son of his brother James, was murdered at his off-campus house near Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, where he was a student. On August 12, 2021, Norfolk Police charged four men with the murder.

Cummings underwent surgery to repair his aortic valve in May 2017 and was absent from Capitol Hill for two months. In July 2017, he developed a surgery-related infection but returned to work. Cummings was later hospitalized for a knee infection.

Cummings was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called thymic carcinoma in 1994 while serving as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. It was revealed in November 2019 that Cummings had lived with the cancer for 25 years, though it was not stated as the cause of death.

=== Death ===
Elijah Cummings died on October 17, 2019, at Johns Hopkins Hospital at the age of 68 from &quot;complications concerning longstanding health challenges&quot;, his spokeswoman stated. Before his funeral service on October 25 at Baltimore&#x27;s New Psalmist Baptist Church, where he was a member for 40 years, Cummings lay in state at the U.S. Capitol Building&#x27;s Statuary Hall on October 24.

Cummings is the first African American lawmaker to achieve the honor of lying in state at the nation&#x27;s Capitol. Prior to his death, the most recent people to lie in state were former Senator John McCain and former President George H. W. Bush. Following a state funeral which was attended by family and members of Congress, thousands of public mourners were seen entering the U.S. Capitol to see his casket and received greetings from his widow, Maya Rockeymoore-Cummings. His casket departed from the U.S. Capitol at around 8:35 p.m.

On October 25, 2019, the official funeral for Cummings was held at the New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore. Many political figures of the Democratic Party, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, John Lewis, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and his predecessor Kweisi Mfume (who then became his successor) attended the funeral service. His friend and colleague Mark Meadows performed the eulogy.

==Political positions==

===Healthcare===
Cummings was in favor of single-payer healthcare. While he supported The Affordable Care Act, he believed the legislation should have added a public option.

===Marijuana===
Cummings believed that marijuana should be legalized and taxed at the same rate as alcohol.

==Honors and awards==
Cummings was awarded many honors and awards in recognition of his political career. These include:

===Honorary degrees===
* Cummings received 13 honorary doctoral degrees from universities across the United States, most recently an honorary doctorate of public service from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2017.

<doc id="414579" wikidata="Q1077819" url="?curid=414579" title="Chris Van Hollen">
<text>Christopher Van Hollen, Jr. ( ; born January 10, 1959) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Maryland, a seat he has held since 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the U.S. representative for Maryland&#x27;s 8th congressional district from 2003 to 2017 and as a Maryland state senator from 1995 to 2003.

In 2007, Van Hollen became the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). In this post, he was responsible for leading efforts to defend vulnerable Democrats and get more Democrats elected to Congress in 2008, which he did. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. He was elected ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010. Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to the 12-member bipartisan Committee on Deficit Reduction with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013, Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.

Van Hollen ran for the United States Senate in 2016 to replace retiring Senator Barbara Mikulski. He defeated U.S. Representative Donna Edwards in the Democratic primary and won the general election with 61% of the vote to Republican nominee Kathy Szeliga&#x27;s 36%. He was reelected in 2022 with nearly 66% of the vote to Republican nominee Chris Chaffee&#x27;s 34%. Van Hollen chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) from 2017 to 2019. Van Hollen became Maryland&#x27;s senior senator when Ben Cardin retired from the Senate in 2025.
==Early life, education, and career==
Van Hollen was born in Karachi, Pakistan, the eldest of three children of American parents, Edith Eliza (née Farnsworth) and Christopher Van Hollen. His father was a Foreign Service officer who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs (1969–1972) and U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives (1972–1976); his mother worked in the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department, where she served as chief of the intelligence bureau for South Asia. He spent parts of his early life in Pakistan, Turkey, India, and Sri Lanka. He returned to the United States for his junior year of high school, and attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where his grandfather had once taught.

He is an alumnus of the Kodaikanal International School (in Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu, India). In 1982, Van Hollen graduated from Swarthmore College with a BA in philosophy. He continued his studies at Harvard University, where he earned a master of public policy, concentrating in national security studies, from the John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1985. He earned a JD from Georgetown University Law Center in 1990.

==Early political career==
Van Hollen worked as a legislative assistant for defense and foreign policy to U.S. Senator Charles Mathias, a Republican from Maryland, from 1985 to 1987. He was also a staff member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (1987–1989), and a legislative advisor for federal affairs to Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer (1989–1991). He was admitted to the Maryland bar in 1990, and joined the law firm of Arent Fox.

==Maryland State Legislature (1991–2003)==
Van Hollen served in the Maryland General Assembly from 1991 to 2003, first in the House of Delegates (1991–1995) and then in the State Senate (1995–2003). In the Senate, he served on the Budget and Taxation Committee and the Health and Human Services Subcommittee. He led successful efforts to raise the tobacco tax, prohibit oil drilling in the Chesapeake Bay, mandate trigger locks for guns, and increase funding for education and healthcare. In 2002, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Van Hollen &quot;one of the most accomplished members of the General Assembly.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives (2003–2017)==
===Elections===
Before Van Hollen&#x27;s election, incumbent Connie Morella had won eight elections in the district, despite being a Republican in a district that had swung heavily Democratic. Morella&#x27;s success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively liberal voting record, including support for abortion rights, gay rights, gun control and increased environmental protections.

After Morella&#x27;s reelection in 2000, Democratic Maryland Senate President Thomas V. Miller, Jr. made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one redistricting plan after the 2000 census divided the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate Mark Kennedy Shriver. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic than its predecessor. It absorbed nine heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring Prince George&#x27;s County, an area Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting. Van Hollen defeated Morella in the 2002 general election in part, according to some analysts, because of this redistricting.

In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic primary against Shriver and former Clinton administration aide Ira Shapiro. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver, 43.5% to 40.6%.

During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept Tom DeLay and the rest of her party&#x27;s more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, HMO reform, trigger locks for handguns, and protecting the Chesapeake Bay from oil drilling. Van Hollen defeated Morella, 51.7% to 48.2%. He crushed Morella in Prince George&#x27;s County while narrowly winning Montgomery County. Morella won most of the precincts she had previously represented.

Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district with over 70% of the vote.

After the 2010 census, Van Hollen&#x27;s district was made slightly less Democratic. He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring 6th district, and lost his share of Prince George&#x27;s County to the 4th district. In their place, the 8th absorbed a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County, as well as the southern part of even more Republican Carroll County. Nonetheless, his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick Counties combined, and Van Hollen won a sixth term over Republican Ken Timmerman with 63% of the vote. He lost in Carroll and Frederick, but swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.

===Tenure===
In 2003, the Committee for Education Funding, a nonpartisan education coalition founded in 1969, named Van Hollen its Outstanding New Member of the Year. The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America&#x27;s Children and Teachers (Keep Our PACT) Act, which would fully fund No Child Left Behind and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. He introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in student loans that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.

Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to outsource federal jobs.
Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local homeland security efforts, education programs and community development projects. He and Adam Schiff (D-CA) often discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House in tandem, with particular commentary on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a congressional caucus on the Netherlands with Dutch-born Republican U.S. Representative Pete Hoekstra from Michigan. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the Netherlands and remember the Dutch role in establishing the State of New York and the United States.
In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the Bush administration to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the 2006 Lebanon War. He was criticized by elements of the Jewish and pro-Israel community, a large part of his constituency, for criticizing U.S. and Israeli policy in the Lebanon conflict. In follow-up comments, Van Hollen indicated that his original comments were meant as a critique of Bush administration policy but did not retract his position, and other members of the local Jewish and pro-Israel community defended him.

In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes, saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress. In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a green bank to catalyze the financing of clean energy and energy efficiency projects. He reintroduced the same bill again in 2014.

In March 2010, when Charles Rangel was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having Sander Levin succeed to the Chairmanship over Pete Stark. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark&#x27;s past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.

On April 29, 2010, Van Hollen introduced the campaign finance DISCLOSE Act. He reintroduced the bill for the 113th Congress on February 9, 2012.

In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the Federal Election Commission, charging it with regulatory capture and the creation of a loophole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election season. According to Van Hollen, had it not been for the loophole, &quot;much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed.&quot;

During the 2012 Obama reelection campaign, Van Hollen participated in one-on-one debate prep with vice president Joe Biden, impersonating the Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan.

===Tenure===
;115th Congress (2017–2019)
Shortly after the 2016 elections, Van Hollen was selected as the Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) for the 2018 cycle.

;117th Congress (2021–present)

Van Hollen was walking to the Senate chambers to speak during the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when he was stopped by U.S. Capitol Police telling him that the building was on lockdown due to the attack on the Capitol. He returned to his office, where he remained for the duration of the attack. In the immediate wake of the insurrection, Van Hollen called Trump a &quot;political arsonist&quot; and said &quot;I never thought we would live to see the day that violent mobs seized control of the Capitol. I cry for our country.&quot; As Van Hollen waited for the Capitol to be secured, he said he wanted an immediate investigation, calling the perpetrators &quot;a violent mob.&quot; He also contrasted the police&#x27;s treatment of the rioters with events that led to the use of tear gas on peaceful demonstrators, such as Black Lives Matter protests. After Congress returned to session to count the electoral votes, he voted against objections raised by some Republican senators. Van Hollen also called for Trump&#x27;s &quot;immediate removal&quot; via the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and said, &quot;we should have looked at that option much earlier.&quot;

==Political positions==

===Conservation===
In 2023 Van Hollen received a 100% score from the League of Conservation Voters.

===Economy===
According to his campaign website, Van Hollen supports an increase in the minimum wage, paid sick leave, an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, equal pay for women, an increase in the child care tax credit, and a financial transactions tax.

===Elections===
In October 2018, Van Hollen and Susan Collins cosponsored the Protect Our Elections Act, legislation that would block &quot;any persons from foreign adversaries from owning or having control over vendors administering U.S. elections&quot; and would make companies involved in administering elections reveal foreign owners and inform local, state and federal authorities if said ownership changes. Companies failing to comply would face fines of $100,000.

===Gun control===
Van Hollen has been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that lobbies for more regulation of guns. In September 2008, he voted against repealing parts of the Washington, D.C., firearm ban. He supports a national assault weapon ban.

In 2015, Van Hollen introduced legislation for increased handgun licensing, specifically the requirement for permit-to-purchase licenses. The proposal was based on a similar law in Maryland. Of his proposal, Van Hollen said, &quot;States require licenses to drive a car or even to fish in local rivers, so requiring a license to buy a deadly handgun is a commonsense step that could save countless lives.&quot;

In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Van Hollen co-sponsored a bill to ban bump stocks.

===Health===
Van Hollen supports Obamacare and has defended it many times. He is also pro-choice and he was an original co-sponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021.

===Israel===
In May 2020, Van Hollen voiced his opposition to Israel&#x27;s plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

In January 2024, Van Hollen voted for a resolution, proposed by Bernie Sanders, to apply the Foreign Assistance Act&#x27;s human rights provisions to U.S. aid to Israel&#x27;s military. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11. After the Israeli military shot and killed an American activist in the West Bank, Van Hollen urged the Biden administration to hold Israel accountable for its actions, saying &quot;If the Netanyahu government will not pursue justice for Americans, the U.S. Department of Justice must.&quot; In November 2024, Van Hollen criticized Biden for what he views as Biden&#x27;s &quot;inaction&quot; in holding Israel accountable for not letting aid into Gaza, calling Biden&#x27;s conduct &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot;.

===Journalism===
In July 2019 Van Hollen cosponsored the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a privately funded memorial to be constructed on federal lands in Washington, D.C. to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters who died in the line of duty.

===LGBTQ rights===
Van Hollen supports transgender rights, having signed a letter in July 2017 in opposition to an announced military ban.

===Taxes===
Van Hollen received a 0% rating for the Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW), and the National Taxpayers Union (NTU), in 2010. Both these organizations advocate for lower taxes for everyone including the wealthy. In 2006, Van Hollen received a 100% rating from Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), a group that calls for higher taxes on the wealthy. Van Hollen opposes eliminating the federal estate tax.

==Personal life==
Van Hollen and his wife Katherine have three children: Anna, Nicholas, and Alexander. Van Hollen is of Dutch descent and is Episcopalian.

===Health===
On May 15, 2022, Van Hollen announced that he had a minor stroke over that weekend and would stay at George Washington University Hospital for a few days. He further said he was expected to make a full recovery with no long-term effects and would return to his work in the Senate later in the week.

<text>Mary Catherine Bateson (December 8, 1939 – January 2, 2021) was an American writer and cultural anthropologist.

The daughter of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, Bateson was a noted author in her field with many published monographs. Among her books was &quot;With a Daughter&#x27;s Eye: A Memoir of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson&quot;, a recounting of her upbringing by two famous parents. She taught at Harvard, Amherst, and George Mason University.

== Early life and education ==
Bateson was a graduate of the Brearley School and received her B.A. from Radcliffe in 1960 and her Ph.D. in linguistics and Middle Eastern Studies from Harvard in 1963. Her dissertation examined linguistic patterns in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry.

==Career==
In the mid-1960s, Bateson became a visiting assistant professor of anthropology at the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines, studying Tagalog and helping organize a sociology seminar with businessman Sixto K. Roxas in 1968 to better address housing needs for the SSS Village then being built in the town of Marikina, Rizal.

Bateson considered herself an &quot;activist for peace and justice&quot; and stressed the importance in the years of “unanticipated longevity” of continuing to be willing to learn. Because of her work on aging and the changing role of women in modern society, Bateson has been referred to as one of the most original thinkers of our time. Lectures by Bateson have encouraged adults to become a lot more engaged in the world and not to retire.

At the beginning of her career, she was a linguist and studied Arabic poetry. Then, she shifted her focus from a professional interest in human patterns of communication to highly-formalistic studies, which started her career as an anthropologist. Changing focus in topics, Bateson began to use her own life experience to write.

Bateson was a fellow of the International Leadership Forum and was president of the Institute for Intercultural Studies in New York until 2010.

==Personal life and death==
Bateson was married to Barkev Kassarjian, a professor of management at Babson College, from 1960 to her death. As graduate students, the young couple purchased, for a sum of $15,000, an 18th-century farmhouse on a wooded 100-acre New Hampshire property that served, in addition to a Cambridge, Massachusetts apartment, as their home for over 50 years. They had one daughter, Sevanne Margaret (born 1969), an actress who works professionally under the name Sevanne Martin, and two grandsons. 

Through her mother&#x27;s side of the family, Bateson was also the cousin of Jeremy Steig as well as a niece of William Steig and Leo Rosten. Toward the end of Bateson&#x27;s residence in Iran in 1979, Catherine&#x27;s mother who was paying a visit to her family in Iran died in New York. Her father then died a year later in 1980.

Bateson died on January 2, 2021, at a hospice near her home in Hancock, New Hampshire, aged 81. She had suffered from brain damage from a fall a few months earlier.

== Works ==
===Style===
Bateson used her own experience as a woman, daughter, mother, scholar, and anthropologist, who went through many different situations, as a guide for her writings. Bateson liked to keep her readers engaged by having them question her ideology and entertain the readings own provoking thoughts with questions. She wrote in a similar style to journaling and often used personal examples or quotes for ideas and observations. She also used cross-cultural experiences of other individuals incorporated into her writings.

One of Bateson&#x27;s first books was her memoir &quot;With a Daughter&#x27;s Eye&quot; in which she reflected on her earlier life with her parents: Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson. The memoir created a path for self-discovery and enablement of the experiences that she incorporated into her writings, such as her next book, &quot;Composing a Life&quot;. That book showed how deeply connected Bateson&#x27;s own journey as a scholar as parallel was to a world in which she and other women faced overt sexism and female inferiority.

<text>Billingsgate is one of the 25 Wards of the City of London. This small City Ward is situated on the north bank of the River Thames between London Bridge and Tower Bridge in the south-east of the Square Mile.

The modern Ward extends south to the Thames, west to Lovat Lane and Rood Lane, north to Fenchurch Street and Dunster Court, and east to Mark Lane and St Dunstan&#x27;s Hill.

==History==
===Legendary origin===
Billingsgate&#x27;s most ancient historical reference is as a water gate to the city of Trinovantum (the name given to London in medieval British legend), as mentioned in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (Eng: &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;) written 1136 by Geoffrey of Monmouth. This work describes how Belinus, a legendary king of Britain said to have held the throne from about 390 BC, erected London&#x27;s first fortified water gate:
===Historical origin===
Originally known as &quot;Blynesgate&quot; and &quot;Byllynsgate&quot;, its name apparently derives from its origins as a water gate on the Thames, where goods were landed, becoming Billingsgate Wharf, part of London&#x27;s docks close to Lower Thames Street.

Historian John Stow records that Billingsgate Market was a general market for corn, coal, iron, wine, salt, pottery, fish and miscellaneous goods until the 16th century, when neighbouring streets became a specialist fish market. By the late 16th century, most merchant vessels had become too large to pass under London Bridge, and so Billingsgate, with its deeply recessed harbour, replaced Queenhithe as the most important landing place in the city.

===Great Fire of London===
Until boundary changes in 2003, the Ward included Pudding Lane, where in 1666 the Great Fire of London started. A sign was erected over the property where the Great Fire began:

===After the Great Fire===
After the Great Fire of London, shops and stalls set up trade forming arcades on the harbour&#x27;s west side, whilst on the main quay, an open market soon developed, called &quot;Roomland&quot;.

===Fish market===

Billingsgate Fish Market was formally established by an act of Parliament in 1699, the Billingsgate, etc. Act 1698 (10 Will. 3. c. 13), to be &quot;a free and open market for all sorts of fish whatsoever&quot;. Oranges, lemons, and Spanish onions were also landed there, alongside the other main commodities, coal and salt. In 1849, the fish market was moved off the streets into its own riverside building, which was subsequently demolished (c. 1873) and replaced by an arcaded-market hall (designed by City architect Horace Jones, built by John Mowlem) in 1875.

In 1982, Billingsgate Fish Market was relocated to its present location close to Canary Wharf in east London. The original riverside market building was then refurbished by the architect Richard Rogers to provide office accommodation and an entertainment venue.

The raucous cries of the fish vendors gave rise to the word &quot;Billingsgate&quot; as a synonym for profanity or offensive language.

Within the ward are the Custom House and the Watermen&#x27;s Hall, built in 1780 and the city&#x27;s only surviving Georgian livery company hall. Centennium House in Lower Thames Street has Roman baths within its basement foundations.

==Churches==
Within the Ward remain two churches: St Mary-at-Hill and St Margaret Pattens, after the demolition of St George Botolph Lane in 1904.

==Politics==
Billingsgate is one of the City&#x27;s 25 Wards returning an Alderman and two Common Councilmen (the City equivalent of a Councillor) to the City of London Corporation, the elected in March 2022 were Luis Felipe Tilleria and Nighat Qureishi.

==In popular culture==

Lord Blackadder, the titular hero of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, is said to have resided at Billingsgate, and in Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair (Ch. 3)&quot;, Mr. Sedley has &quot;brought home the best turbot in Billingsgate&quot;.

Billingsgate is also referred to in the song &quot;Sister Suffragette&quot; in the 1964 version of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.

Due to the real and perceived vulgar language used by the fishmongers, which Francis Grose referred to in his &quot;Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot;, Billingsgate came to be used as a noun——referring to coarse or foul language.

<text>Jonathan Christopher &quot;Jon&quot; Porter (born May 16, 1955) is an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, the first representative elected from the 3rd congressional district of Nevada.

He won re-election in the 2006 midterm election against Tessa Hafen by a 48%–47% margin. On November 4, 2008, after three consecutive terms, he was defeated by Nevada State Senator Dina Titus, a Democrat and professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

== Early life, education, and early political career ==
Porter was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and graduated from Humboldt High School in Humboldt, Iowa. He attended Briar Cliff College and worked in his family business for several years before moving to Boulder City, Nevada, a suburb of Las Vegas.

He began his political career in 1983 when he was elected to the Boulder City Council. That year he also became an agent for Farmers Insurance. Porter was elected mayor of Boulder City in 1987 and served in that capacity until 1991. He served in the Nevada Senate from 1994 until 2002.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In December, 2005, he joined with several other congressmen to form the Second Amendments, a bipartisan rock and country band set to play for United States troops stationed overseas over the holiday season.

===Elections===
;2000
Porter lost the race for U.S. Congress in Nevada&#x27;s 1st congressional district against Democratic incumbent Shelley Berkley. Berkley won 52% to 44%.

;2002
However, this immediately made him the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the newly created 3rd District. The district had been created due to a population explosion in the Las Vegas area. Porter easily won the Republican nomination and faced Clark County Commissioner Dario Herrera. The race was considered one of the hottest in the nation, in part because the district had been created as a &quot;fair fight&quot; district. However, Herrera&#x27;s campaign foundered due to ethical problems, most notably when he was paid $50,000 by the Las Vegas Housing Authority for &quot;public relations work.&quot; Porter won 56% to 37%.

;2004
Porter defeated Tom Gallagher by a wider-than-expected 14-point margin (54% to 40%).

;2006
Porter won re-election over his opponent Tessa Hafen, former press secretary for U.S. Senator Harry Reid, with 48% to 47%.

;2008
The closeness of the 2006 race, combined with the marginal nature of the district, led Democrats to target Porter for defeat in 2008. After their initial choice, Clark County District Attorney Robert Daskas, dropped out for family reasons, the Democrats quickly recruited State Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for governor in 2006. In the November 2008 election, Porter lost only the second general election of his career, taking 42 percent of the vote to Titus&#x27; 47 percent. Porter was likely hampered by a sharp increase in Democratic registration, as well as Barack Obama carrying the district with 55 percent of the vote. Additionally, Porter was seen as a potentially strong challenger to Harry Reid, the Democratic Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate who was up for reelection in 2010, so it was thought that Reid targeted Porter for defeat in order to eliminate him as a possible opponent.

===Committee assignments===
Porter was a member of the Ways and Means Committee and the Budget Committee.

== Post-congressional career ==

=== Lobbying ===
Since 2008, Porter leads Porter Group, a political lobbying and business consulting firm in Washington, D.C.

<text>Erich Julius Eberhard von dem Bach-Zelewski (born Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski; 1 March 1899 – 8 March 1972) was a German politician, military officer and high-ranking SS commander. During World War II, he was in charge of the Nazi security warfare against those designated by the regime as ideological enemies and any other persons deemed to present danger to the Nazi rule or &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s rear security in the occupied territories of Eastern Europe. It mostly involved atrocities against the civilian population. In 1944, he led the brutal suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. Despite his responsibility for numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity, Bach-Zelewski did not stand trial in the Nuremberg trials, and instead appeared as a witness for the prosecution. He was later convicted for politically motivated murders committed before the war and died in prison in 1972.

==Biography==
=== Origins and family ===
Erich Julius Eberhard von dem Bach-Zelewski was born as Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski in Lauenburg on 1 March 1899 to Kashubian parents, Otto Johannes von Zelewski (1859–1911) and Amalia Maria Eveline Schimanski (born 1862). His father, an officer and farmer, was of an impoverished Kashubian family of landed gentry with roots in Seelau. His uncle, Emil von Zelewski, died in 1891 as commanding officer of the Schutztruppe of German East Africa while fighting the Hehe. The Zelewski family had originally spoken Kashubian and Polish at home and for generations was connected with the Roman Catholic church in Linde, but as an adult Zelewski joined a Protestant church. Since his father had to pay off several siblings, he sold the manor he inherited and became a traveling salesman. Zelewski and his six siblings therefore grew up in relative poverty in Bialla in East Prussia, where he attended an elementary school. When he was twelve, his father died, and the children were placed in foster families. Zelewski was taken in as the foster son of a landowner named Schickfuss in Trebnig. Zelewski attended several high schools, in Neustadt, Strasburg, and Konitz.

=== First World War===
The outbreak of the First World War came during the school summer holidays of 1914, while Zelewski was staying with his mother in Bialla. He was only fifteen, but in December 1914 he succeeded in enlisting in the Prussian Army, gaining some notoriety as its youngest volunteer. He served throughout the First World War. In 1915, he was wounded by a bullet in the shoulder and in 1918 suffered a poison gas attack. He was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class, and later First Class. By the end of the war he had been promoted to &quot;Leutnant&quot;. 

===Between the wars===
Following the armistice of November 1918, Zelewski remained in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and fought against the Polish Silesian Uprisings. In 1924, he resigned his army commission (or was discharged) and returned to his farm in Düringshof (now Bogdaniec in the Gorzów Wielkopolski county of Poland). He became a member of the German veterans&#x27; organization &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and also joined the &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund&quot;, the largest, most active and most influential anti-Semitic organization in the Weimar Republic. Zelewski enrolled with the border guards (&quot;Grenzschutz&quot;) the same year.

Zelewski legally added &quot;von dem Bach&quot; to his family name on 23 October 1925. On 28 November 1940, he removed the &quot;Zelewski&quot; part of his surname because of its Polish-sounding origin. Bach-Zelewski manipulated his genealogy numerous times in his career to impress his superiors.

In July 1930, Bach-Zelewski left the &quot;Grenzschutz&quot;, and joined the Nazi Party. Bach-Zelewski joined the SS on 15 February 1931. He achieved the rank of SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; on 15 December 1933. During this period he reportedly quarreled with his staff officer, Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald, and had him killed during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 (for which he was convicted of manslaughter in 1961).

A source of considerable embarrassment for him was the fact that all three of his sisters had married Jewish men. After the war, he claimed under interrogation that this had ruined his reputation in the army, forcing him to leave the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. 

A Nazi Party member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from 1932–44, Bach-Zelewski participated in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, using the opportunity to have his rival Buchwald murdered. From 1934 on he served as leader of SS main districts (&quot;SS-Oberabschnitten&quot;), initially in East Prussia and after 1936 in Silesia. In 1937, he was named Senior SS and Police Leader (HSSPF, or &quot;Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;) in Silesia, and also served as Commander of SS main district South East (&quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Südost&quot;). 

===World War II===
In November 1939, SS chief Heinrich Himmler offered Bach-Zelewski the post of &quot;Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germandom&quot; in East-Silesia (the Polish territories incorporated into Silesia in 1939). His duties included mass resettlement and the confiscation of Polish private property. By August 1940, some 18,000–20,000 Poles from Żywiec County were forced to leave their homes in what became known as the Action Saybusch (German name for Żywiec).

Bach-Zelewski provided the initial impetus for the building of Auschwitz concentration camp at the former Austrian and later Polish military barracks in the Zasole suburb of Oświęcim due to overcrowding of prisons. The location was scouted by his subordinate &quot;Oberführer&quot; Arpad Wigand. The first transport arrived at KL Auschwitz on 14 June 1940, and two weeks later Bach-Zelewski personally visited the camp. In June 1941, he resumed his duties as HSSPF in Silesia.

====Occupied Soviet Union====
During Operation Barbarossa, Bach-Zelewski served as HSSPF in the territory of Belarus. From July to September 1941, he oversaw the murder of Jews in Riga and Minsk by the &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot;, led by Arthur Nebe, also visiting other sites of mass killings such as Bialystok, Grodno, Baranovichi, Mogilev, and Pinsk. Bach-Zelewski regularly cabled to headquarters on the extermination progress; for example, the 22 August message stated: &quot;Thus the figure in my area now exceeds the thirty thousand mark&quot;. At the end of 1941 the forces under von dem Bach numbered 14,953 Germans, mostly officers and &quot;unteroffiziere&quot;, and 238,105 local &quot;volunteers&quot; (most war crime victims were murdered by local collaborators under German command).

In February 1942, he was hospitalized in Berlin for treatment of &quot;intestinal ailments&quot; stemming from opium abuse, and was described as suffering from &quot;hallucinations connected with the shooting of Jews&quot;. Before resuming his post in July, Bach-Zelewski petitioned Himmler for reassignment to anti-partisan warfare duty. Von dem Bach was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and General of Police on 9 November 1941.

In June 1942, Reinhard Heydrich, acting Reich-Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, was assassinated in Prague. Hitler chose Bach-Zelewski as his replacement, but Himmler protested that he could not be spared due to the prevailing military situation. Hitler relented and appointed Kurt Daluege to the position. Through 1943, Bach-Zelewski remained in command of &quot;anti-partisan&quot; units on the central front, a special command created by Hitler. He was the only HSSPF in the occupied Soviet territories to retain genuine authority over the police after Hans-Adolf Prützmann and Friedrich Jeckeln lost theirs to the civil administration. 
====Genocidal tactics====
At some time in June 1943, Himmler issued the &quot;Bandenbekämpfung&quot; (bandit fighting) order, simultaneously announcing the existence of the &quot;Bandenkampfverbände&quot; (bandit fighting formations), with Bach-Zelewski as its chief. Employing troops primarily from the SS police and Waffen-SS, the &quot;Bandenkampfverbände&quot; had four principal operational components: propaganda, centralized control and coordination of security operations, training of troops, and battle operations. Once the Wehrmacht had secured territorial objectives, the &quot;Bandenkampfverbände&quot; first secured communications facilities, roads, railways, and waterways. Thereafter, they secured rural communities and economic installations such as factories and administrative buildings. An additional priority was securing agricultural and forestry resources. The SS oversaw the collection of the harvest, which was deemed critical to strategic operations. Any Jews in the area were rounded up and murdered. Communists and people of Asian descent were murdered presumptively under the assumption that they were Soviet agents. Under Bach-Zelewski, the formations were responsible for the mass murder of 35,000 civilians in Riga and more than 200,000 in Belarus and eastern Poland.

Bach-Zelewski&#x27;s methods produced a high civilian death toll and relatively minor military gains. In fighting irregular battles with the partisans, his units slaughtered civilians in order to inflate the figures of &quot;enemy losses&quot;; indeed, far more fatalities were usually reported than weapons captured. The German troops would encircle areas controlled by the partisans in a time-consuming manner, allowing real partisans to slip away. After an operation was completed, no permanent military presence was maintained, which gave the partisans a chance to resume where they had left off. Even when successful in pacification actions, Bach-Zelewski usually accomplished little more than to force the real enemy to relocate and multiply their numbers with civilians enraged by the massacres.

Bach-Zelewski told Leo Alexander:


In July 1943, Bach-Zelewski received command of all anti-partisan actions in Belgium, Belarus, France, the General Government, the Netherlands, Norway, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and parts of the Bezirk Bialystok. In practice, his activities remained confined to Belarus and contiguous parts of Russia. 

In early 1944, he took part in front-line fighting in the Kovel area, but in March he had to return to Germany for medical treatment. Himmler assumed all his posts. 

==== Warsaw Uprising ====

On 2 August 1944, Bach-Zelewski took command of all German troops fighting Bor-Komorowski&#x27;s Home Army that had staged the Warsaw Uprising. The German forces were made up of 17,000 men arranged in two battle groups: under , and under Heinz Reinefarth – the latter included the Dirlewanger Brigade of convicted criminals. This command group was named after Bach-Zelewski, as &quot;Korpsgruppe Bach&quot;. Units under his command murdered approximately 200,000 civilians (more than 65,000 in mass executions) and an unknown number of prisoners of war, in numerous atrocities throughout the city.

After more than two months of heavy fighting and the almost total destruction of Warsaw, Bach-Zelewski managed to take control of the city, committing atrocities in the process, notably the Wola massacre. Bach-Zelewski was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1944. On 4 October 1944, he accepted the surrender of General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski. Incidentally, during the slaughter and razing of Warsaw, he is alleged to have personally saved Fryderyk Chopin&#x27;s heart, by taking it for his own collection of curiosities. The recovered heart is held at Warsaw&#x27;s Holy Cross Church.

=== Last months of the War ===

In October 1944, he was sent by Hitler to the Hungarian capital Budapest, where he participated in the fall of Regent Miklós Horthy and his government, and its replacement by the fascist and highly anti-Semitic Arrow Cross Party with their leader Ferenc Szálasi. In particular, he was involved in the persecution of the Hungarian Jews.

In December 1944 he became commander of the XIV SS Corps in the Baden-Baden region and between 26 January and 10 February 1945 of the X SS Corps in Pomerania, where his unit was annihilated after less than two weeks. He then commanded from 17 February 1945, the Oder Corps under Army Group Vistula.

===After the war===
After the war in Europe ended, Bach-Zelewski went into hiding and tried to leave the country. US military police arrested him on 1 August 1945. In exchange for his testimony against his former superiors at the Nuremberg trials, Bach-Zelewski never faced trial for any war crimes. Similarly, he never faced extradition to Poland or to the USSR. During his testimony at the Nuremberg trials, Bach-Zelewski stated that he disapproved of Himmler&#x27;s aim to exterminate 30 million Slavs, but explained it thus: &quot;when, for years, for decades, the doctrine is preached that the Slav is a member of an inferior race and that the Jew is not even human, then such an explosion is inevitable.&quot; In saying so, Bach-Zelewski effectively linked the facts of mass murder on the ground to Nazi ideology, and established the connection between the Wehrmacht and the actions of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in the Soviet Union, which turned out to be of great value to interrogators and prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials. 

Bach-Zelewski left prison in 1949. In 1951, Bach-Zelewski claimed that he helped Hermann Göring commit suicide in 1946. As evidence, he produced cyanide capsules to the authorities with serial numbers not far removed from the one used by Göring. The authorities never verified Bach-Zelewski&#x27;s claim, and did not charge him with aiding Göring&#x27;s death. Most modern historians dismiss Bach-Zelewski&#x27;s claim and agree that a U.S. Army contact within the Palace of Justice&#x27;s prison at Nuremberg most likely aided Göring in his suicide.

===Trials and convictions===
In 1951, Bach-Zelewski was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp for the murder of political opponents in the early 1930s; however, he did not serve prison time until February 1961, when he was convicted of the manslaughter of Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald, an SS officer, during the Night of the Long Knives. He was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months imprisonment. In November 1961, he was sentenced to another six months in prison for perjury.

In 1962, Bach-Zelewski was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of seven German Communists in the early 1930s. None of the sentences referred to his role in Poland, in the Soviet Union, or his participation in the Holocaust, although he openly denounced himself as a mass murderer. He had at the same time &quot;denounced Himmler&#x27;s racism in strong terms, as well as incitement to ‘exterminate &quot;inferior races&quot;, possibly to curry favor with prosecutors. Bach-Zelewski died in Harlaching Hospital after transfer from Stadelheim Prison due to illness in Munich on 8 March 1972, a week after his 73rd birthday.

Bach-Zelewski gave evidence for the defence at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Israel in May 1961. His evidence was to the effect that operations in Russia and parts of Poland were conducted by Operations Units of the Security Police and were not subject to the orders of Eichmann&#x27;s office, nor was Eichmann able to give orders to the officers in charge of these units, who were responsible for the murder of Jews and Gypsies. The evidence was provided at a hearing in Nuremberg in May 1961.

==Family life==
He married Ruth Apfeld in 1922, had three daughters (Giesele, Ines, Ilse) and three sons (Heinrich, Ludolf, Eberhard). In 1947, while being a prisoner in Nuremberg, he took a Catholic church wedding with his wife. In 1957, Erich&#x27;s two sons, Heinrich and Eberhard, emigrated to the United States. Eberhard joined the U.S. Army, where he worked as an organizational commissioner.
