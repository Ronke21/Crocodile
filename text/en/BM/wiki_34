<text>The Pearl District is an area of Portland, Oregon, formerly occupied by warehouses, light industry and railroad classification yards and now noted for its art galleries, upscale businesses and residences. The area has been undergoing significant urban renewal since the mid-1980s when it was reclassified as mixed use from industrial, including the arrival of artists, the removal of a viaduct and construction of the Portland Streetcar. It now consists of industrial building conversion to offices, high-rise condominiums and warehouse-to-loft conversions.

The increase of high-rise condominiums and warehouse-to-loft conversions was made evident with the construction of the Cosmopolitan on the Park building, which opened in Summer 2016. The Cosmopolitan on the Park residential building is now the tallest building in the Pearl District and the 8th tallest building in Portland, contributing to the changing Portland skyline.

==Geography and features==
The area is located just northwest of downtown between West Burnside Street on the south, the Willamette River on the north, NW Broadway on the east and the Interstate 405 freeway which crosses Fremont Bridge (Portland, Oregon) on the west.

The area is home to several Portland icons, including Powell&#x27;s City of Books. The former Weinhard Brewery, which operated continuously from 1864 to September 1999, was shut down by Stroh&#x27;s upon the purchase of the Weinhard&#x27;s brand by Miller Brewing and sold for redevelopment as the Brewery Blocks.

There are art galleries and institutions such as the Elizabeth Leach Gallery and Blue Sky Gallery (many who stage monthly receptions), boutiques, and restaurants abound, and also a number of small clubs and bars, a combination that has led to Pearl District being named one of the 15 coolest neighborhoods in the world in 2016.

The United States Post Office main processing facility for all of Oregon and southwestern Washington was built in the Pearl District in 1964, next to Union Station. This location was chosen in order for the post office to be able to better serve towns outside the Portland metro area.

The region is part of Portland’s 4th City Council District, Multnomah County&#x27;s District 1, Oregon Metro&#x27;s 5th district, Oregon&#x27;s 33rd House district, Oregon&#x27;s 17th Senate district and Oregon&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

===Parks===
The district includes most of the historic North Park Blocks (1869), as well as three public plazas:
*Jamison Square (2002) is built around a fountain which simulates a tidal pool that is periodically filled by artificial waterfalls and then drained into grating.
*Tanner Springs Park (2005) is a re-created natural area featuring wetlands, a walking trail, and creek.
*The Fields Park (2013) is a Neighborhood and Dog Park in the Northern part of the Pearl. The Park provides space for visual or performing arts, for community-building activities and has a large paved walking loop.

Once completed, it will also contain a section of the Green Loop.

===Public Art===
*Memory 99, a steel sculpture in the North Park Blocks commemorating the opening of the Pacific Northwest College of Art in 2012
*Never Look Away (mural)
*Dog Bowl (sculpture)
*Tikitotmoniki Totems
*Lovejoy Columns
*Nepenthes (sculpture)
*Artwall

==Demographics==
In 2020 it was reported that 11,019 people lived in the Pearl District, comprising 7,191 households. This was an 84% increase from the 5,993 people reported living in the neighborhood in 2010. Of the 74% of people who identified as white on the 2020 census, 71% did not mark down an additional race. On the same census, 10.8% of people identified as Asian, 8.3% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 5.8% identified as Black or African American, 2.8% identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.5% identified as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 6.5% indicated some other race. 

Of all Pearl District residents surveyed in 2020, 22% had moved to Portland over the past year, 100% had completed high school or a GED, 82% had broadband access, 8% reported experiencing a disability, and 18% struggled to put food on the table. It was also reported that 8% of the area was covered by tree canopy.

==History==


The area was formerly used for warehousing, light industrial purposes and a railroad yard.

The Pearl District was first named in print in March 1987, in an article titled “The Pearl District” by Terry Hammond in &quot;The Rose Arts Magazine&quot;, a free local periodical in Portland. Marty Smith uncovered the origin story and corrected rumors in his humorous Dr. Know column in &quot;Willamette Week&quot; in January 2014. “Hammond says he wrote it with the express purpose of getting the name to stick.” He “stumped hard” for the name in the neighborhood while selling ads and distributing the paper.

At the time, the city was calling the area the Triangle, though the NW Triangle Planning District explicitly referred only to the railroad yards on the far side of NW Lovejoy Street. The NW Triangle Business Association for the area was calling it the Triangle, too, but found the name unsatisfactory, and recognized other options, like the Brewery District and others. An article in &quot;The Rose Arts Magazine&quot; presented the alternate names, and argued &quot;The Pearl District&quot; was best to refer to the treasury of art and artists inhabiting the interiors of so many of the crusty warehouses. The article included photos of the area and a map, and profiled individual artists with studios in several of the warehouses, including photographer Hiroshi Iwaya, glass artist Liz Mapelli, sculptor Martin Eichinger, ceramic artist Geoffrey Pagen, and silkscreen printers Elizabeth Harris and Russ Mahler.

Terry Hammond acknowledged in an endnote that the name &quot;the Pearl&quot; originated from Thomas Augustine of the Augustine Gallery, then located at NW 13th &amp; Hoyt St. He tracked the progress of the name over the next two years, and reported in October 1989 the identity of the Pearl District “is now firmly established,” when he found investors adopted the name. The second &quot;Rose Arts&quot; article reported a brochure for the newly remodeled Irving Street Lofts, formerly the McKesson Building, named the area “Portland’s emerging Pearl District.” The building was the first converted warehouse up to code for residences.

The second news story showed another map of the district with 37 numbered locations indicating special events organized by local artists and businesses for the third annual Pearl Arts Festival. The editor gave the following series of Pearl landmarks: (a) Victoria Frey of Quartersaw Gallery, 528 NW 12th Ave., was enthusiastic about the name, and organized the first annual Pearl Arts Festival in September 1987, six months after the initial article; like others, she had not heard the name before, (b) &quot;Sunset Magazine&quot; picked up the story in January 1988, and adopted the name in quotation marks in the title as the &quot;Pearl District,&quot; (c) &quot;The Oregonian&quot; daily newspaper first adopted the name in September 1988, at the time of the second annual Pearl Arts Festival, following the original Pearl District article in &quot;The Rose Arts Magazine&quot; with a map and profiles of some of the same artists, (d) Investors adopted the name in promotional materials as converted warehouses turned residential, starting in 1989.

In the 1990s, the Lovejoy Viaduct, an elevated portion of NW Lovejoy Street from the Broadway Bridge past NW 10th Avenue was demolished, opening dozens of surrounding blocks (including some brownfield sites) for development, which peaked in the 2000s. The viaduct was notable for the Lovejoy Columns, painted by a railroad watchman who worked below; two of them have been saved. The increasing density has attracted a mix of restaurants, brewpubs, shops, and art galleries. The movie &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; (1989), by Gus Van Sant, has several scenes shot in the neighborhood.

==Covid-19 Health and Safety Response==

An employee of the Pearl District Whole Foods Market was reported to have died of Covid-19 in April 2020. On June 3, 2020, seven employees at the same location participated in a walk out calling for stricter safety measures. 

In August 2021, Daniel Shoemaker, owner of the Teardrop Lounge bar coordinated an effort of 15-25 local bars and restaurants including Andina (restaurant) to require diners to show proof of vaccination prior to entry. This followed a six week period during the summer of 2021 in which the Oregon indoor mask mandate was temporarily lifted. The mandate otherwise ran from July 2020 to March 2022. Another Pearl District establishment requiring proof of vaccination during this time included longstanding resident theater company Portland Center Stage. 

Some retailers, such as Powell&#x27;s Books, organized curbside pickup to facilitate social distancing.

<doc id="415981" wikidata="Q4416302" url="?curid=415981" title="St. Johns Bridge">
<text>The St. Johns Bridge is a steel suspension bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States, between the Cathedral Park neighborhood in North Portland and the Linnton and Northwest Industrial neighborhoods in Northwest Portland. It carries the U.S. Route 30 Bypass. It is the only suspension bridge in the Willamette Valley and one of three public highway suspension bridges in Oregon.

The bridge has a center span and a total length of . It is the tallest bridge in Portland, with two towers and a navigational clearance. The adjacent park and neighborhood of Cathedral Park are named after the Gothic arch design of the bridge&#x27;s towers and supports.

==History==

=== Design and construction ===

Designed by consulting engineers David B. Steinman (1886–1960) and Holton D. Robinson, of New York, the St. Johns was the longest suspension-type bridge west of the Mississippi River at the time of construction. It is the only major highway suspension bridge in the Willamette Valley and one of only three major highway suspension bridges in Oregon.

At the time of the proposal to build the bridge, the area was served by a ferry that carried 1,000 vehicles a day. The proposal for a bridge was initially met with skepticism in Multnomah County, since St. Johns and Linnton were over five miles (8 km) from the heart of the city, and local business owners had minimal political clout. But after a lobbying effort that included a vaudeville-style show performed at grange halls and schools throughout the county, voters approved a $4.25 million bond for the bridge in the November 1928 elections. Initially, a cantilever bridge was proposed, but a suspension bridge was selected due to an estimated $640,000 savings in construction costs.

The construction of the bridge began a month before the stock market crash of 1929 and provided many county residents with employment during the Great Depression. Because of its proximity to the Swan Island Municipal Airport, some government officials wanted the bridge painted yellow with black stripes. County officials waited until St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 1931 to announce that it would be painted green.

Dedication of the bridge was put off for one month in order to make it the centerpiece of the 23rd annual Rose Festival. It was dedicated on June 13, 1931, and during the ceremony, the bridge engineer, David B. Steinman, said: 
The bridge was built within 21 months and one million dollars under budget. At the time of its completion, the bridge had:
* the highest clearance in the nation,
* the longest prefabricated steel cable rope strands,
* the tallest steel frame piers of reinforced concrete,
* the first application of aviation clearance lights to the towers, and
* longest suspension span west of Detroit, Michigan.

=== 1949 murder case ===
Eighteen years after the opening, the St. John&#x27;s Bridge became a site of an infamous murder in 1949, when a 15-year-old high school student Thelma Taylor was abducted and held by her captor, Morris Leland, near the east side of the bridge (which was undeveloped at the time, now near the location of Cathedral Park), and was eventually murdered there. The crime shocked the city and, after her captor was apprehended and later found guilty of first-degree murder, he was executed in January 1953.

=== Deterioration and present-day maintenance ===

By the 1970s, the bridge had been allowed to deteriorate, and cash-strapped Multnomah County asked the state to take over maintenance. Initially, the state declined, since it was also suffering from a lack of funds. But pressure from an association of county governments forced the state government to take it over on August 31, 1975. A county official estimated the move saved them $10 million during the first ten years of state maintenance.

Portions of the east approaches and east span were repainted beginning in 1987 and completed in 1994.

In 1999, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced a $27 million rehabilitation project that began in March 2003 and was completed in the fall of 2005. Included in the project was replacement of the deck, repainting of the towers, waterproofing the main cables, lighting upgrades, and improving access for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. By November 2004, renovation costs soared to $38 million, due mostly to the need to replace nearly half of the 210 vertical suspender cables. During the project, the bridge sidewalks were closed at all times. In addition, the entire bridge was closed at night and continuously for a month. The newly refurbished bridge was rededicated on September 17, 2006.

In July 2015, a group of protesters affiliated with Greenpeace rappelled from the bridge to prevent the icebreaker MSV &quot;Fennica&quot; from leaving Portland, because it was destined to help Shell Oil Company drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea. They stayed there for forty hours, prompting the icebreaker to turn around after an initial departure attempt a few hours into the blockade. The vessel did eventually get through after three climbers came down, although it was met by dozens of kayakers in the water who joined the effort to slow or stop the ship from moving forward.

In March 2019, an illegally constructed and partially finished skate park was discovered in the bridge&#x27;s western cable house. Following ODOT&#x27;s concerns about the skatepark&#x27;s impacts on the bridge&#x27;s cable house, it was torn down in 2020.

<text>The University of Portland (UP) is a private Catholic university in Portland, Oregon, United States. It was founded in 1901 and is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross, which also founded UP&#x27;s sister school, the University of Notre Dame. UP enrolls approximately 3,730 students.

The campus is in the University Park neighborhood near St. Johns, on a bluff overlooking the Willamette River. With a college of arts and sciences, a graduate school, and schools of business, education, engineering, and nursing and health innovations, it is Oregon&#x27;s only comprehensive Catholic university. UP is North Portland&#x27;s largest corporation and has an annual economic impact on Portland of $170 million. More than 13,000 alumni live in the Portland metropolitan area.

==History==

The first institution located on Waud&#x27;s Bluff was Portland University, which was established by the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1891. Amid financial setbacks following the Panic of 1893, Portland University vacated the Bluff Campus to hold classes from 1896 to 1897 in East Portland, where it was joined temporarily by the recently insolvent College of Puget Sound.

According to University of Portland tradition, Archbishop Alexander Christie, the head of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon, saw a large building on the bluff from aboard a ship on the nearby Willamette River. He learned that it was called West Hall and had been unoccupied for several years since the closure of Portland University.

The Archdiocese purchased West Hall (renamed Waldschmidt Hall in 1992) and the surrounding campus with financial assistance from the Congregation of Holy Cross, and named the new institution Columbia University after the nearby Columbia River. The university opened its doors to 52 young men on September 5, 1901, with eight Catholic priests from the local archdiocese serving as professors. At the request of the archbishop, the Congregation of the Holy Cross assumed ownership of the university in 1902.

After two decades, Columbia University achieved junior college status. In 1925, the university&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences was founded, and in 1929, a class of seven men were awarded the university&#x27;s first bachelor&#x27;s degrees. In 1935, the school took on its present name, the University of Portland. The 1930s also saw the St. Vincent Hospital school incorporated to the university as the School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations, and the creation of the School of Business.

In 1948 the school of Engineering was founded, followed by the Graduate School in 1950 and the School of Education in 1962. University of Portland admitted women to all courses of study in 1951. Prior to this transition, Marylhurst University had been the only Catholic institution of higher learning to serve the educational needs of Oregon women. The building housing the library was completed in 1957. In 1967 ownership of the school was transferred from the Congregation of Holy Cross to a board of Regents. Multnomah College became part of the University of Portland (UP) in 1969.

==Rankings==
The University of Portland was ranked as the second-best Western Regional University by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for 2022. The University ranked third for Best Undergraduate Teaching and sixth for Best Value.

==Admissions==
Admission to UP is rated as &quot;selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

For the Fall of 2022 Portland had an acceptance rate of 93%. Half the applicants admitted to University of Portland have an SAT score between 1160 and 1360 or an ACT score between 26 and 31. However, a standardized test score is not required as a part of the application. 

==Academics==
UP has six divisions of study: the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Pamplin School of Business Administration, the School of Education, the Shiley School of Engineering, the School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations, and the Graduate School. The most popular majors for undergraduates are Nursing, Biology, Marketing &amp; Management, Finance, Elementary Education, Organizational Communication, Psychology, and Spanish.

===College of Arts &amp; Sciences===
The College of Arts &amp; Sciences is the liberal arts core of the university and has seventeen departments: Biology, Chemistry, Communication Studies, English, Environmental Studies, International Languages &amp; Cultures, History, Mathematics, Performing &amp; Fine Arts, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, Social Work, Sociology, and Theology.

Several of the departments offer graduate programs in addition to their undergraduate majors, and these programs dual report to the Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Dean of the Graduate School. The Communication Studies department offers a M.A. in communication and a M.S. in Management Communication. The Performing &amp; Fine Arts department offers the M.F.A. in Directing. This program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre. The Theology department offers a three-year Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry. The M.A.P.M. program was started in 2000 in collaboration with Gonzaga University, but in 2010 the partnership ended and the University of Portland continues to offer the program independently.

===Pamplin School of Business Administration===
The Pamplin School of Business Administration is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Its undergraduate program ranked as among the &quot;Best Undergraduate Business Programs&quot; by &quot;U.S. News&quot; and its Part-Time MBA is placed highly in &quot;U.S. News&quot;″ Best Grad School rankings.

The undergraduate program offers a BA in economics and a BBA in five different areas: Accounting, Finance, Economics, Marketing and Sustainability, and Operations and Technology Management.

At the graduate level the PSOB offers a MS in finance, a MS in Operations &amp; Technology Management, an MBA, an MBA in Nonprofit Administration, a technology entrepreneurship certificate, and a post-MBA certificate. The graduate degrees are accountable to both the Dean of the PSOBA and the Dean of the Graduate School. The MBA program is noted for its diversity within the context of Oregon. Among the five AACSB MBA programs in Oregon, Pamplin School of Business has the highest percentage of women, minorities, and international students.

===School of Education===
The University of Portland School of Education is an undergraduate and graduate program which provides graduates with a teaching license in some, but not all U.S. states. The program is characterized by an emphasis on field experience, and inclusion, with first classroom placements beginning almost immediately. It received the 2002 Model of Excellence Award from the Association of Independent Colleges for Teacher Education (AILACTE).

The PACE (Pacific Alliance for Catholic Education) program allows 15–25 teachers to earn a graduate degree during summer school, while gaining in-classroom teaching experience during the academic year at a Catholic school over a three-year period. PACE students live in community with other PACE students in Draper, Ogden, and Salt Lake City, Utah; Seattle, and Tri-Cities, Washington; Redding and Red Bluff, and Sacramento, California; Fairbanks, Alaska; and Portland, Oregon.

At the graduate level, the school of education offers a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) degree, a Master of Arts, a Master of Arts in Teaching, a Master of Education, and post-Master&#x27;s certificate programs in neuroeducation, reading, special education, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), and educational administration.

===Shiley School of Engineering===
The school of engineering was founded in 1948 and grew substantially in 1969 when UP absorbed Multnomah College. Multnomah College had been established in 1897 as the Educational Department of the YMCA in downtown Portland, Oregon,
and in 1969 was the oldest fully accredited two-year college in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Multnomah College was noted for its engineering program and as a result of the merger UP renamed its school the Multnomah School of Engineering. University of Portland&#x27;s School of Engineering is a perennially top-40 school among the nation&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees-granting institutions, according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In 2012, it ranked 35th.

In 2007 the University of Portland was given a $12 million gift (the largest in UP&#x27;s history at that time) toward the School of Engineering by Donald and Darlene Shiley of San Diego. Donald Shiley arrived at UP the year the school of engineering was founded. Graduating in 1951 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in general engineering, he would later invent a heart valve and various medical devices that have been credited with saving thousands of lives. Shiley Hall is now the largest building on the UP campus and has won several awards for sustainable design and construction. The Shileys later gave an additional $8 million gift to the engineering school, which was then renamed the Donald P. Shiley School of Engineering.

The school offers accredited Bachelor of Science degrees in mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering, as well as a Bachelor of Science in computer science. A Master of Engineering degree, in collaboration with the Pamplin School of Business Administration, is offered at the graduate level.

===School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations===
The School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations was established as the St. Vincent Hospital School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations in 1892, two years after the northwest region&#x27;s first nurse training program was founded at nearby Good Samaritan Hospital. Throughout the 20th century many nursing education programs relocated from hospitals to institutions of higher learning; the St. Vincent school became part of this national trend when it joined the University of Portland in 1934 and began granting a four-year degree in 1938. Today most clinical practice still takes place at St. Vincent Hospital and other hospitals associated with Providence Health &amp; Services, a not-for-profit Catholic health care ministry.

The School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations awards the BS in Nursing baccalaureate degree and the MS in Nursing graduate degree. The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) is a professional doctorate program initiated in 2008. The master&#x27;s entry program (AEM-UP) enables individuals who possess a non-nursing bachelor&#x27;s degree to enter nursing at the graduate level. In collaboration with practice partners, the clinical nurse leader Master of Science degree prepares generalists for leadership at the point of care. In 2007, the School of Nursing &amp; Health Innovations was ranked 72nd in the nation by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. American Assembly for Men in Nursing named the University of Portland the nation&#x27;s Best Nursing School for Men.

===Graduate school===
The Graduate School oversees the post-bachelor&#x27;s degree programs that are embedded within the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and the four professional schools. The Dean of the Graduate School reports to the Provost and collaborates with the deans of the various schools to ensure academic standards are enforced for their respective graduate-level courses of study.

==Campus==

The University of Portland sits on top of Waud&#x27;s Bluff overlooking the industrialized Swan Island and the Willamette River. The university is located in the University Park neighborhood of North Portland, a primarily residential area of the city. The university campus is bordered by Willamette Boulevard to the east, the Willamette River to the west and south and private residences to the north.

The campus itself is a traditional college campus with three residential quads, East Quad, Villa Quad, and North Quad, as well as an Academic Quad. The main academic building on campus is Franz Hall. Located at the center of the university across from the Chapel of Christ the Teacher, it houses the Pamplin School of Business and the School of Education. Other academic buildings include Buckley Center, Swindells Hall, Shiley Hall, Romanaggi Hall, Mago Hunt Center, and the Clark Library.

There are ten main residence hall communities on campus: Mehling Hall, Corrado Hall, Villa Maria, Shipstad Hall, Kenna Hall, Christie Hall, Haggerty and Tyson Halls, Fields Hall, Schoenfeldt Hall, and Lund Family Hall. They are divided into three residential quads: Villa Quad, East Quad, and North Quad. Mehling, Corrado, and Villa Maria are situated around the Villa Quad, and Shipstad, Kenna, and Christie are situated around the East Quad. The North Quad comprises Fields, Schoenfeldt, Haggerty &amp; Tyson, and Lund Family Hall.

==Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps==
The University of Portland currently host two detachments of the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps: the Air Force Reserve Officer&#x27;s Training Corps and the Army Reserve Officer&#x27;s Training Corps.

The Air Force ROTC program at the University of Portland is one of the oldest programs on campus, established in 1951. The AFROTC unit on the campus, known as Detachment 695, is also one of the largest in the country, with its membership numbering nearly 4% of the campus undergraduate student population. In 2004, Detachment 695 was recognized as the top large detachment in the nation, receiving AFROTC&#x27;s prestigious Right of Line Award. In 2011, the detachment received recognition as the top unit of 34 in the AFROTC Northwest Region. In 2012, Detachment 695 again won AFROTC&#x27;s Right of Line Award, this time as the best medium-sized detachment in the nation. The offices for Detachment 695 are located in the basement of Kenna Hall.

Since 1996, the university has hosted an Army ROTC program which has grown to include over 70 cadets and a cadre of seven faculty and staff. Offices for the University of Portland Pilot Battalion of the Army ROTC are located in Villa Maria.

==Athletics==
UP&#x27;s NCAA soccer program became well known after Clive Charles, who started coaching the men&#x27;s team in 1986, added the women&#x27;s head coaching job in 1989, heading both teams until his death in 2003. The women&#x27;s team won the NCAA Division I National Championship in 2002 and 2005, led both years by current Canadian international star Christine Sinclair. Home matches are played at 4,892-seat Merlo Field, part of the Clive Charles Soccer Complex on campus. The University of Portland&#x27;s soccer team is one of the oldest college programs in the U.S., going back to 1910, and was played as a club sport almost continually until 1977, when it gained full varsity status.

Beyond soccer, UP also boasts one of the nation&#x27;s top NCAA Division I men&#x27;s cross country teams. The Pilots won 31 straight West Coast Conference Championships through 2010, one of the longest conference championship streaks in the NCAA. On the national level, UP has finished in the top ten at the NCAA Championships five times. In 2008, the Pilots placed seventh in the nation, matching their finish from 2001, and later in 2013. In 2014 the Pilots placed third at the Division 1 national cross country Championships. In 2017 the Pilots cross country program placed second at the Division 1 national cross country championships for their highest ever finish.

Other intercollegiate sports at UP include basketball, baseball, volleyball, track and field, tennis, and rowing. In November 2010, the school announced it would add Women&#x27;s Rowing effective with the 2011–12 academic year, while dropping both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf. In 2017 Beach Volleyball was added as the 16th varsity sport. In November 2005, the University of Portland stood at 25th in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s College All Sport rankings. UP&#x27;s previously sponsored football program was disbanded in 1950 due to lack of funding.

Students participate in club level sports such as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, ultimate frisbee, crew, and water polo, as well as a variety of intramural sports.

==Expansion and development==

The school is undergoing expansion and renovations for both its campus housing facilities, academic buildings, and recreation facilities. For housing, a new residence hall (Lund Family) was built for the 2016–2017 school year. The university also renovated the existing dining facility known as The Commons, which was renamed the Bauccio Commons in honor of alumnus Fedele Bauccio, who founded the Bon Appetit Management Company which provides food services to the campus.

In academics, the Engineering Building was renovated using a $12 million gift for its expansion and improvement from Donald and Darlene Shiley. Additionally, the university has completely renovated the Clark Library. Elsewhere, a bell tower located adjacent to the Christ the Teacher Chapel was completed in September 2009. At 100 feet, it is the tallest structure on campus, as well as in North Portland, a title that Mehling Hall held previously.

In athletics and recreation, in May 2014, the university began construction on the Beauchamp Recreation and Wellness Center, named after the university&#x27;s 19th president, Rev. E. William Beauchamp. It will feature state of the art strength and cardio training facilities, 3 gymnasiums, a suspended track, a bike shop, classrooms, and an outdoor pursuits office. It was scheduled to be completed by May 2015. Additionally, in June 2014, renovations began on Joe Etzel Baseball field to include improved lighting, fencing, and artificial turf.

Plans for a $30 million, three-story academic building were announced in March 2017. The building encompasses 65,616 square feet with 17 classrooms, 35 faculty offices, 12 informal and formal gathering spaces, including 4 conference rooms, and the 146-seat Brian J. Doyle Auditorium. Construction began September 2017, delayed a few months while the university was raising $15 million. The hall is named the Dundon-Berchtold Hall, and was completed before the start of the 2019–2020 academic year.

The School recently completed the Shiley-Marcos Center for Design and Innovation. The project cost $40 million and was assisted by a $10 million gift from Darlene Marcos Shiley.

<doc id="415983" wikidata="Q5685577" url="?curid=415983" title="Hawthorne Bridge">
<text>The Hawthorne Bridge is a truss bridge with a vertical lift that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, joining Hawthorne Boulevard and Madison Street. It is the oldest vertical-lift bridge in operation in the United States and the oldest highway bridge in Portland. It is also the busiest bicycle bridge in Oregon, with over 8,000 cyclists and 800 TriMet buses (carrying about 17,400 riders) daily. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

== Statistics ==
The bridge consists of five fixed spans and one vertical-lift span. It is in total length. The bridge was originally wide, including two five-foot sidewalks, but the sidewalks were widened to 10 feet in 1998, increasing the structure&#x27;s overall width to . The counterweights are suspended from the two towers. It is operated by a pair of 150-horsepower motors. On average, the lift span is raised for river traffic 120 times per month. While the river is at low level, the bridge is above the water, causing it to be raised an average of 200 times per month. As of 2001, the average daily traffic was 30,500 vehicles. The bridge was designed by Waddell &amp; Harrington, which also designed the Steel and Interstate bridges. John Alexander Low Waddell invented the modern-day vertical-lift bridge.

== History ==
The current bridge was built to replace the second Madison Street Bridge, a wooden bridge built in 1900. It cost $511,000 to build and was opened on December 19, 1910. Hawthorne Boulevard (and thus the bridge) was named after Dr. J.C. Hawthorne, the cofounder of Oregon&#x27;s first mental hospital and early proponent for the first Morrison Bridge.

The streetcar tracks across the bridge were originally in the outer lanes, but were relocated to the center lanes in 1931. The deck was changed from wood to steel grating in 1945.
In 1985, the lift span sheaves, the grooved wheels that guide the counterweight cables, were replaced. The bridge went through a $21 million renovation from 1998 to 1999, which included replacing the steel grated deck and repainting. The original lead-based paint was completely removed and replaced with 3 layers of new paint that is estimated to last 30 years. During this upgrade, the sidewalks were widened to , making it a thoroughfare for bicycle commuters. Due to the replacement of the steel deck during this project, the channels which used to carry the rails for streetcars and interurban trains were also removed. The bridge was closed for one year to permit the renovation to be carried out.

The original color of the bridge was black, lasting until 1964, when it was repainted yellow-gold ochre. During the 1998–99 renovation, the color was changed to green with red trim.

In 2001, the sidewalks were connected to the Eastbank Esplanade. In 2005, the estimated cost to replace the bridge was $189.3 million.

The 2003 film, &quot;The Hunted&quot;, included a scene set on MAX on the Hawthorne Bridge. Since MAX does not cross the bridge, the movie company connected two articulated buses remodeled to resemble a MAX train, complete with fake overhead lines and a sprinkler system to simulate rain. Light-rail (interurban) service did cross the Hawthorne Bridge until 1956.

The new deck put in place in the outer lanes during the 1998–99 renovation was designed to be strong enough for possible use by modern, heavier streetcars or light rail trains in the future, which was proposed at that time, and TriMet was still considering a Hawthorne Bridge routing for its future MAX Orange Line, to Milwaukie, in 2002. However, following the transit agency&#x27;s later decision to build the Tilikum Crossing for the Milwaukie MAX line, which bridge could also be used by the Portland Streetcar, it became unlikely that rail cars will ever again cross the Hawthorne Bridge.

The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

=== Bicycle counter ===
In August 2012, an automated real-time bicycle counter was installed on the bridge, the first such counter to be installed in a U.S. city. It was purchased by the non-profit group Cycle Oregon for $20,000 and donated to the city. The city paid $5,000 for its installation. The millionth rider was counted in July 2013. The counter was broken in 2018 and has not been repaired; no data has been recorded since.

<doc id="416005" wikidata="Q876695" url="?curid=416005" title="Indeterminism">
<text>Indeterminism is the idea that (or certain events, or events of certain types) are not caused, or are not caused deterministically.

It is the opposite of determinism and related to chance. It is highly relevant to the philosophical problem of free will, particularly in the form of metaphysical libertarianism. In science, most specifically quantum theory in physics, indeterminism is the belief that no event is certain and the entire outcome of anything is probabilistic. Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle and the &quot;Born rule&quot;, proposed by Max Born, are often starting points in support of the indeterministic nature of the universe. Indeterminism is also asserted by Sir Arthur Eddington, and Murray Gell-Mann. Indeterminism has been promoted by the French biologist Jacques Monod&#x27;s essay &quot;Chance and Necessity&quot;.
The physicist-chemist Ilya Prigogine argued for indeterminism in complex systems.
==Necessary but insufficient causation==
Indeterminists do not have to deny that causes exist. Instead, they can maintain that the only causes that exist are of a type that do not constrain the future to a single course; for instance, they can maintain that only necessary and not sufficient causes exist. The necessary/sufficient distinction works as follows:

If &quot;x&quot; is a necessary cause of &quot;y&quot;; then the presence of &quot;y&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; definitely preceded it. The presence of &quot;x&quot;, however, does not imply that &quot;y&quot; will occur.

If &quot;x&quot; is a sufficient cause of &quot;y&quot;, then the presence of &quot;y&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; may have preceded it. (However, another cause &quot;z&quot; may alternatively cause &quot;y&quot;. Thus the presence of &quot;y&quot; does not imply the presence of &quot;x&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;, or any other suspect.)

It is possible for everything to have a necessary cause, even while indeterminism holds and the future is open, because a necessary condition does not lead to a single inevitable effect. Indeterministic (or probabilistic) causation is a proposed possibility, such that &quot;everything has a cause&quot; is not a clear statement of indeterminism.

==Probabilistic causation==

Interpreting causation as a deterministic relation means that if &quot;A&quot; causes &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; must always be followed by &quot;B&quot;. In this sense, however, war does not always cause deaths (see Cyberwarfare), nor does a singular moment of smoking always cause cancer. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, &quot;A&quot; probabilistically causes &quot;B&quot; if &quot;A&quot;&#x27;s occurrence increases the probability of &quot;B&quot;. This is sometimes interpreted to reflect the imperfect knowledge of a deterministic system but other times interpreted to mean that the causal system under study has an inherently indeterministic nature. (Propensity probability is an analogous idea, according to which probabilities have an objective existence and are not just limitations in a subject&#x27;s knowledge).

It can be proved that realizations of any probability distribution other than the uniform one are mathematically equal to applying a (deterministic) function (namely, an inverse distribution function) on a random variable following the latter (i.e. an &quot;absolutely random&quot; one); the probabilities are contained in the deterministic element. A simple form of demonstrating it would be shooting randomly within a square and then (deterministically) interpreting a relatively large subsquare as the more probable outcome.

==Intrinsic indeterminism versus unpredictability==

A distinction is generally made between indeterminism and the mere inability to measure the variables (limits of precision). This is especially the case for physical indeterminism (as proposed by various interpretations of quantum mechanics). Yet some philosophers have argued that indeterminism and unpredictability are synonymous.

==Philosophy==
===Ancient Greek philosophy===

====Leucippus====
The oldest mention of the concept of chance is by the earliest philosopher of atomism, Leucippus, who said:
&quot;The cosmos, then, became like a spherical form in this way: the atoms being submitted to a casual and unpredictable movement, quickly and incessantly&quot;.

====Aristotle====

Aristotle described four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle&#x27;s word for these causes was αἰτίαι (&quot;aitiai&quot;, as in &quot;&quot;), which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic &quot;every event has a (single) cause&quot; idea that was to come later.

In his &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, Aristotle said there were accidents (συμβεβηκός, &quot;sumbebekos&quot;) caused by nothing but chance (τύχη, &quot;tukhe&quot;). He noted that he and the early physicists found no place for chance among their causes.

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:

 Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.
 It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.
====Pyrrhonism====
The philosopher Sextus Empiricus described the Pyrrhonist position on causes as follows:

...we show the existence of causes are plausible, and if those, too, are plausible which prove that it is incorrect to assert the existence of a cause, and if there is no way to give preference to any of these over others – since we have no agreed-upon sign, criterion, or proof, as has been pointed out earlier – then, if we go by the statements of the Dogmatists, it is necessary to suspend judgment about the existence of causes, too, saying that they are no more existent than non-existent

====Epicureanism====
Epicurus argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would &quot;swerve&quot; (&quot;clinamen&quot;) from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions, something impossible if every action was deterministically caused. For Epicureanism, the occasional interventions of arbitrary gods would be preferable to strict determinism.

===Early modern philosophy===
In 1729 the&quot;Testament&quot; of Jean Meslier states:

&quot;The matter, by virtue of its own active force, moves and acts in blind manner&quot;. 

Soon after Julien Offroy de la Mettrie in his &quot;L&#x27;Homme Machine.&quot; (1748, anon.) wrote:

&quot;Perhaps, the cause of man&#x27;s existence is just in existence itself? Perhaps he is by chance thrown in some point of this terrestrial surface without any &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;&quot;. 

In his &quot;Anti-Sénèque&quot; [&quot;Traité de la vie heureuse, par Sénèque, avec un Discours du traducteur sur le même sujet&quot;, 1750] we read:

&quot;Then, the chance has thrown us in life&quot;.

In the 19th century the French Philosopher Antoine-Augustin Cournot theorized &quot;chance&quot; in a new way, as series of not-linear causes. He wrote in &quot;Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances&quot; (1851):

&quot;It is not because of rarity that the chance is actual. On the contrary, it is because of chance they produce many possible others.&quot; 

===Modern philosophy===

====Charles Peirce====
Tychism ( &quot;chance&quot;) is a thesis proposed by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in the 1890s. It holds that absolute chance, also called spontaneity, is a real factor operative in the universe. It may be considered both the direct opposite of Albert Einstein&#x27;s oft quoted dictum that: &quot;God does not play dice with the universe&quot; and an early philosophical anticipation of Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle.

Peirce does not, of course, assert that there is &quot;no&quot; law in the universe. On the contrary, he maintains that an absolutely chance world would be a contradiction and thus impossible.
Complete lack of order is itself a sort of order. The position he advocates is rather that there are in the universe both regularities and irregularities.

Karl Popper comments that Peirce&#x27;s theory received little contemporary attention, and that other philosophers did not adopt indeterminism until the rise of quantum mechanics.

====Arthur Holly Compton====
In 1931, Arthur Holly Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat paradox.

Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of our actions, Compton clarified the two-stage nature of his idea in an &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of choice.

A set of known physical conditions is not adequate to specify precisely what a forthcoming event will be. These conditions, insofar as they can be known, define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will occur. When one exercises freedom, by his act of choice he is himself adding a factor not supplied by the physical conditions and is thus himself determining what will occur. That he does so is known only to the person himself. From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law. It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the actor himself that he is free.
Compton welcomed the rise of indeterminism in 20th century science, writing:
In my own thinking on this vital subject I am in a much more satisfied state of mind than I could have been at any earlier stage of science. If the statements of the laws of physics were assumed correct, one would have had to suppose (as did most philosophers) that the feeling of freedom is illusory, or if [free] choice were considered effective, that the laws of physics ... [were] unreliable. The dilemma has been an uncomfortable one.
Together with Arthur Eddington in Britain, Compton was one of those rare distinguished physicists in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s arguing for the “liberation of free will” with the help of Heisenberg’s indeterminacy principle, but their efforts had been met not only with physical and philosophical criticism but most primarily with fierce political and ideological campaigns.

====Karl Popper====
In his essay &quot;Of Clouds and Clocks&quot;, included in his book &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot;, Popper
contrasted &quot;clouds&quot;, his metaphor for indeterministic systems, with &quot;clocks&quot;, meaning deterministic ones.
He sided with indeterminism, writing

I believe Peirce was right in holding that all clocks are clouds to some considerable degree — even the most precise of clocks. This, I think, is the most important inversion of the mistaken determinist view that all clouds are clocks
Popper was also a promoter of propensity probability.

====Robert Kane====
Kane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on free will. Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles &quot;libertarian freedom&quot;, Kane argues that &quot;(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent&#x27;s power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)&quot;. It is important to note that the crux of Kane&#x27;s position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR). Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will. It is necessary that there be (metaphysically) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control. The control is found in &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot;.

What allows for ultimate responsibility of creation in Kane&#x27;s picture are what he refers to as &quot;self-forming actions&quot; or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills. These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR. UR does not require that &quot;every&quot; act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs. These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action. If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.

====Mark Balaguer====
Mark Balaguer, in his book &quot;Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem&quot; argues similarly to Kane. He believes that, conceptually, free will requires indeterminism, and the question of whether the brain behaves indeterministically is open to further empirical research. He has also written on this matter &quot;A Scientifically Reputable Version of Indeterministic Libertarian Free Will&quot;.

==Science==
===Mathematics===
In probability theory, a stochastic process, or sometimes random process, is the counterpart to a deterministic process (or deterministic system). Instead of dealing with only one possible reality of how the process might evolve over time (as is the case, for example, for solutions of an ordinary differential equation), in a stochastic or random process there is some indeterminacy in its future evolution described by probability distributions. This means that even if the initial condition (or starting point) is known, there are many possibilities the process might go to, but some paths may be more probable and others less so.

===Classical and relativistic physics===
The idea that Newtonian physics proved causal determinism was highly influential in the early modern period.
&quot;Thus physical determinism [..] became the ruling faith among enlightened men; and everybody who did not embrace this new faith was held to be an obscurantist and a reactionary&quot;. However: &quot;Newton himself may be counted among the few dissenters, for he regarded the solar system as &quot;imperfect&quot;, and consequently as likely to perish&quot;.

Classical chaos is not usually considered an example of indeterminism, as it can occur in deterministic systems such as the three-body problem.

John Earman has argued that most physical theories are indeterministic. For instance, Newtonian physics admits solutions where particles accelerate continuously, heading out towards infinity. By the time reversibility of the laws in question, particles could also head inwards, unprompted by any pre-existing state. He calls such hypothetical particles &quot;space invaders&quot;.

John D. Norton has suggested another indeterministic scenario, known as Norton&#x27;s Dome, where a particle is initially situated on the exact apex of a dome.

Branching space-time is a theory uniting indeterminism and the special theory of relativity. The idea was originated by Nuel Belnap. The equations of general relativity admit of both indeterministic and deterministic solutions.

===Boltzmann===

Ludwig Boltzmann was one of the founders of statistical mechanics and the modern atomic theory of matter. He is remembered for his discovery that the second law of thermodynamics is a statistical law stemming from disorder. He also speculated that the ordered universe is only a small bubble in a larger sea of chaos. The Boltzmann brain is a similar idea.

===Evolution and biology===
Darwinian evolution has an enhanced reliance on the chance element of random mutation compared to the earlier evolutionary theory of Herbert Spencer. However, the question of whether evolution requires genuine ontological indeterminism is open to debate

In the essay &quot;Chance and Necessity&quot; (1970) Jacques Monod rejected the role of final causation in biology, instead arguing that a mixture of efficient causation and &quot;pure chance&quot; lead to teleonomy, or merely &quot;apparent&quot; purposefulness.

The Japanese theoretical population geneticist Motoo Kimura emphasises the role of indeterminism in evolution. According to neutral theory of molecular evolution: &quot;at the molecular level most evolutionary change is caused by random drift of gene mutants that are equivalent in the face of selection.

===Prigogine===

In his 1997 book, &quot;The End of Certainty&quot;, Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief. &quot;The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism.&quot; This is a major departure from the approach of Newton, Einstein and Schrödinger, all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of irreversibility and instability.

Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to Darwin, whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles. This led to the field of statistical mechanics and the realization that gases undergo irreversible processes. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the arrow of time. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the &quot;present,&quot; which follows a determined &quot;past&quot; and precedes an undetermined &quot;future.&quot; All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including diffusion, radioactive decay, solar radiation, weather and the emergence and evolution of life. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of probability.

Prigogine asserts that Newtonian physics has now been &quot;extended&quot; three times, first with the use of the wave function in quantum mechanics, then with the introduction of spacetime in general relativity and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems.

===Quantum mechanics===

At one time, it was assumed in the physical sciences that if the behavior observed in a system cannot be predicted, the problem is due to lack of fine-grained information, so that a sufficiently detailed investigation would eventually result in a deterministic theory (&quot;If you knew exactly all the forces acting on the dice, you would be able to predict which number comes up&quot;).

However, the advent of quantum mechanics removed the underpinning from that approach, with the claim that (at least according to the Copenhagen interpretation) the most basic constituents of matter at times behave indeterministically. This comes from the collapse of the wave function, in which the state of a system upon measurement cannot in general be predicted. Quantum mechanics only predicts the probabilities of possible outcomes, which are given by the Born rule. Non-deterministic behavior in wave function collapse is not only a feature of the Copenhagen interpretation, with its observer-dependence, but also of objective collapse and other theories.

Opponents of quantum indeterminism suggested that determinism could be restored by formulating a new theory in which additional information, so-called hidden variables, would allow definite outcomes to be determined. For instance, in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper titled &quot;Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?&quot; arguing that such a theory was in fact necessary to preserve the principle of locality.
In 1964, John S. Bell was able to define a theoretical test for these local hidden variable theories, which was reformulated as a workable experimental test through the work of Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt. The negative result of the 1980s tests by Alain Aspect ruled such theories out, provided certain assumptions about the experiment hold. Thus any interpretation of quantum mechanics, including deterministic reformulations, must either reject locality or reject counterfactual definiteness altogether. David Bohm&#x27;s theory is the main example of a non-local deterministic quantum theory.

The many-worlds interpretation is said to be deterministic, but experimental results still cannot be predicted: experimenters do not know which &#x27;world&#x27; they will end up in. Technically, counterfactual definiteness is lacking.

A notable consequence of quantum indeterminism is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which prevents the simultaneous accurate measurement of all a particle&#x27;s properties.

===Cosmology===
Primordial fluctuations are density variations in the early universe which are considered the seeds of all structure in the universe. Currently, the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of cosmic inflation. According to the inflationary paradigm, the exponential growth of the scale factor during inflation caused quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field to be stretched to macroscopic scales, and, upon leaving the horizon, to &quot;freeze in&quot;.
At the later stages of radiation- and matter-domination, these fluctuations re-entered the horizon, and thus set the initial conditions for structure formation.

===Neuroscience===
Neuroscientists such as Björn Brembs and Christof Koch believe thermodynamically stochastic processes in the brain are the basis of free will, and that even very simple organisms such as flies have a form of free will. Similar ideas are put forward by some philosophers such as Robert Kane.

Despite recognizing indeterminism to be a very low-level, necessary prerequisite, Björn Brembs says that it&#x27;s not even close to being sufficient for addressing things like morality and responsibility.

===Other views===
Against Einstein and others who advocated determinism, indeterminism—as championed by the English astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington—says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists&#x27; understanding. The uncertainty principle, then, would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself.

Determinism and indeterminism are examined in &quot;Causality and Chance in Modern Physics&quot; by David Bohm. He speculates that, since determinism can emerge from underlying indeterminism (via the law of large numbers), and that indeterminism can emerge from determinism (for instance, from classical chaos), the universe could be conceived of as having alternating layers of causality and chaos.

<doc id="416007" wikidata="Q952371" url="?curid=416007" title="Power take-off">
<text>A power take-off or power takeoff (PTO) is one of several methods for taking power from a power source, such as a running engine, and transmitting it to an application such as an attached implement or separate machine.

Most commonly, it is a splined drive shaft installed on a tractor or truck allowing implements with mating fittings to be powered directly by the engine.

Semi-permanently mounted power take-offs can also be found on industrial and marine engines. These applications typically use a drive shaft and bolted joint to transmit power to a secondary implement or accessory. In the case of a marine application, such as shafts may be used to power fire pumps.

In aircraft applications, such an accessory drive may be used in conjunction with a constant speed drive. Jet aircraft have four types of PTO units: internal gearbox, external gearbox, radial drive shaft, and bleed air, which are used to power engine accessories. In some cases, aircraft power take-off systems also provide for putting power &quot;into&quot; the engine during engine start. See also Coffman starter.

==History==

Various power transmission methods were available before power take-offs became common, but there were applications which would benefit more from some of the attributes that PTOs would provide. Flat belts were generally only useful for applications where the engine was stationary, such as factory steam engines, portable stationary engines, or traction engines parked in front of the work. For moving vehicles such as a traction engine or early tractor towing a farm implement, the implement could receive rotary power by taking it from one of its own wheels (whose turning was imparted by the towing) and distributing it via roller chains (to a sickle bar&#x27;s crank, for example), but such a transmission ceases if the vehicle stops traveling, and the workload&#x27;s resistance tends to make the wheel skid rather than turn, even if cleated. The concept of a shaft drive with easily connected and disconnected couplings, and flexibility for driving at changing angles (such as when an articulated tractor-and-trailer combination turns), was a goal to pursue.

Experimental power take-offs were tried as early as 1878, and various homemade versions were constructed over the subsequent decades. 
International Harvester Company (IHC) was first to market with a PTO on a production tractor, with its model 8-16, introduced in 1918. Edward A. Johnston, an IHC engineer, had been impressed by a homemade PTO that he saw in France about a decade before, improvised by a French farmer and mechanic surnamed Gougis. He and his IHC colleagues incorporated the idea into the 8-16, and designed a family of implements to take advantage of the feature. IHC was not alone in the market for long, as within a year PTOs were appearing on other production tractors, such as some Case models. In 1920, IHC offered the PTO option on their 15-30 tractor, and it was the first PTO-equipped tractor to be submitted for a Nebraska tractor test. The PTO was a competitive advantage for IHC in the 1920s, and other companies eventually caught up with PTO implementation.

Inside the transmission, the exact point along the gear train where the power is taken off determines whether the PTO can be run independently of vehicle travel (ground speed). Early PTOs were often taken off the main output shaft, meaning that the vehicle had to be &quot;in gear&quot; in order to run the PTO. Later this was improved by so-called live PTO (LPTO) designs, which allow control of the PTO rotation independently of the tractor motion. This is an advantage when the load driven by the PTO requires the tractor motion to slow or stop running to allow the PTO driven equipment to catch up. It also allows operations where the tractor remains parked, such as silo-filling or unloading a manure spreader to a pile or lagoon rather than across a field. In 1945, Cockshutt Farm Equipment Ltd of Brantford, Ontario, Canada, introduced the Cockshutt Model 30 tractor with LPTO. Live PTOs eventually became a widespread norm for new equipment; in modern tractors, LPTO is often controlled by push-button or selector switch. This increases safety of operators who need to get close to the PTO shaft.

==Safety==
The PTO, as well as its associated shafts and universal joints, are a common cause of incidents and injury in farming and industry. According to the National Safety Council, six percent of tractor related fatalities in 1997 in the United States involved the PTO. Incidents can occur when loose clothing is pulled into the shaft, often resulting in bone fractures, loss of limbs, other permanent disabilities, or death to its wearer. On April 13, 2009, former Major League Baseball star Mark Fidrych died as a result of a PTO related accident; &quot;He appeared to have been working on his truck when his clothes became tangled in the truck&#x27;s power take-off shaft&quot;, District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement. Despite much work to reduce the frequency and severity of agricultural injuries, these events still occur.

Some implements employ light free-spinning protective plastic guards to enshroud the PTO shaft;
these are mandatory in some countries. 
In the UK, Health and Safety Executive guidance is contained in a leaflet.

==Technical standardization==
Agricultural PTOs are standardized in dimensions and speed. The ISO standard for PTOs is &quot;ISO 500&quot;, which as of the 2004 edition was split into three parts:
#&quot;ISO 500-1&quot; General specifications, safety requirements, dimensions for master shield and clearance zone
#&quot;ISO 500-2&quot; Narrow-track tractors, dimensions for master shield and clearance zone
#&quot;ISO 500-3&quot; Main PTO dimensions and spline dimensions, location of PTO.

The original type (designated as Type 1) calls for operation at 540 revolutions per minute (rpm). A shaft that rotates at 540 rpm has six splines on it, and a diameter of .

Two newer types, supporting higher power applications, operate at 1000 rpm and differ in shaft size. Farmers typically differentiate these two types by calling them &quot;large 1000&quot; or &quot;small 1000&quot; as compared to the Type 1 which is commonly referred to as the &quot;540&quot;. All new types (2, 3, and 4) use involute splines, whereas Type 1 uses straight splines.

Inch-denominated shafts are round, rectangular, square, or splined; metric shafts are star, bell, or football-shaped.

Due to ever-increasing horsepower requirements from farm implements, and higher horsepower engines being installed in farm tractors, a still larger type (designated as Type 4) has been added to ISO 500. It operates at a higher rotational speed of 1300 rpm in order to allow for power transfer at reduced levels of torque. The shaft has 22 splines with a major diameter of 57.5 millimeters (mm). It is meant to handle PTO powers up to 450 kilowatts (kW), or roughly 600 horsepower (hp).

All four types rotate counterclockwise when viewed looking back from inside the tractor&#x27;s cab; when standing behind the tractor and looking directly at the shaft, it turns clockwise.
A 10-spline type was used with some early equipment such as the 1948 Land Rover. A six-spline adapter was usually supplied. It is customary for agricultural machines manufacturers to provide the nominal PTO power specification, an indication of the available instantaneous power at the shaft. Newer tractors may come equipped with 540/540E and/or 1000/1000E options that allow the tractor to power certain low-power-demand implements like hay rakes or tedders using lower engine speeds to maintain the revolutions per minute needed, using less fuel and placing less stress on the engine – thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs. 

The first industry standard for PTO design was adopted by ASAE (the American Society of Agricultural Engineers) in April 1927. The PTO rotational speed was specified as 536 ± 10 rpm; the direction was clockwise. The speed was later changed to 540 rpm.

==Use on commercial vehicles==
Truck transmissions have one or more locations which allow for a PTO to be mounted. The PTO must be purchased separately and care is required to match the physical interface of the transmission with a compatible PTO. PTO suppliers will usually require details of the make, model and even serial number of the transmission. Care is also needed to ensure that the physical space around the transmission allows for installation of the PTO. The PTO is engaged and disengaged using the main transmission clutch and a remote control mechanism which operates on the PTO itself. Typically, an air valve is used to engage the PTO, but a mechanical linkage, electric or hydraulic mechanism are also options.

Most Unimogs come with front and/or rear PTOs and hydraulics as well as three point hitch systems.

Units will be rated according to the continuous and intermittent torque that can be applied through them and different models will offer different &quot;PTO shaft rotation to engine RPM&quot; ratios.

In the majority of cases, the PTO will connect directly to a hydraulic pump. This allows for transmission of mechanical force through the hydraulic fluid system to any location around the vehicle where a hydraulic motor will convert it back into rotary or linear mechanical force. Typical applications include:
* Running a water pump on a fire engine or water truck
* Running a truck mounted hot water extraction machine for carpet cleaning (driving vacuum blower and high-pressure solution pumps)
* Powering a blower system used to move dry materials such as cement
*Powering a vehicle-integrated air compressor system
* Raising a dump truck bed
* Operating the mechanical arm on a bucket truck used by electrical maintenance personnel or cable TV maintenance crews
* Operating a winch on a tow truck
* Operating the compactor on a garbage truck
* Operating a Boom/Grapple truck
* Operating a truck mounted tree spade and lift-mast assembly

===Split shaft ===
A split shaft PTO is mounted to the truck&#x27;s drive shaft to provide power to the PTO. Such a unit is an additional gearbox that separates the vehicle&#x27;s drive shaft into two parts:
* The gearbox-facing shaft which will transmit the power of the engine to the split shaft PTO;
* The axle-facing shaft which transmit the propelling power to the axle.
The unit itself is designed to independently divert the engine&#x27;s power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches, which can be operated at total driveline standstill only. Because the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear, the PTO cannot be operated while the vehicle is moving.

On 4x4 vehicles, only the rear drive shaft is used by the split shaft PTO gearbox, requiring the vehicle&#x27;s 4x4 drive scheme to be of the &quot;selectable 4WD&quot; type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.

It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO: for example, fire truck pumps.

===&quot;Sandwich&quot; split shaft===
A &quot;sandwich&quot; type split shaft unit is mounted between engine and transmission and used on road maintenance vehicles, fire fighting vehicles and off-road vehicles. This unit gets the drive directly from the engine shaft and can be capable of delivering up to the complete engine power to the PTO. Usually these units come with their own lubricating system. Due to the sandwich mounting style, the gearbox will be moved away from the engine, requiring the driveline to accommodate the installation.

<text>These United States submarines were lost either to enemy action or to &quot;storm or perils of the sea.&quot;

==Before World War II==
Additionally:
*, decommissioned as a target, flooded and sank unexpectedly 30 July 1919 in Two Tree Channel near Niantic, Connecticut with the loss of three crew.
* foundered 7 December 1921 in of water on a pre-commissioning dive. She was raised and commissioned 14 October 1922.
*, decommissioned on 2 May 1931, she was berthed at Philadelphia until 26 February 1936 when she sank at her mooring. Later raised, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 May 1936 and on 19 August she was used as a target vessel for an aerial bombing test.

=== American submarine losses ===

During World War II, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s submarine service suffered one of the highest casualty percentage of all the American armed forces, losing one in five submariners. Some 16,000 submariners served during the war, of whom 375 officers and 3,131 enlisted men were killed, resulting in a total fatality rate of around 22%.

Fifty-two submarines of the United States Navy were lost during World War II, all but one, , were lost in the Pacific theater of operations. Two – &quot;Dorado&quot; (SS-248) and – were lost to friendly fire (though there is speculation that the &quot;Dorado&quot; may have struck a German mine), at least three more – &quot;Tulibee&quot;, &quot;Tang&quot;, and &quot;Grunion&quot; – to defective torpedoes, and six to accident or grounding.

Another eight submarines went missing while on patrol and are presumed to have been sunk by Japanese mines, as there are no known Japanese anti-submarine attacks in their patrol areas. The other thirty-three lost submarines are known to have been sunk by the Japanese.

===Additional casualties===

There are two additional casualties to submarines in World War II that are sometimes considered as effectively two additional losses.

 was damaged by Japanese air and surface forces on 14 November 1944. She was able to reach Saipan and later Pearl Harbor on 1 December, departing San Francisco for Portsmouth Navy Yard on 16 February 1945. There it was determined that she was a constructive total loss and beyond economical repair, but might be useful as a school ship, similar to the postwar immobile pierside training submarines. However, her career in this capacity was brief, and &quot;Halibut&quot; was decommissioned at Portsmouth Navy Yard 18 July 1945 and sold for scrap in January 1947.

 was commissioned on 12 February 1945 and sank at pier 8 at the Boston Navy Yard on 15 March 1945, apparently without loss of life and reportedly still incomplete. She was raised eight days later, decommissioned on 24 March 1945, and never completed or fully repaired. Postwar, she was listed as a Reserve Fleet submarine until stricken in 1958 and scrapped in 1959, having never gone to sea.

===Additional incidents===

The former was transferred to the Royal Navy 9 March 1942 and renamed as HMS &quot;P.514&quot;. On 21 June 1942 she was rammed by the Royal Canadian Navy minesweeper and sank with all hands after the submarine was mistaken for a German U-boat.

The former was sold in 1931 to a private owner for use as a tourist attraction, with the hulk reacquired by the U.S. Navy for &quot;experimental purposes&quot; in 1941. She foundered and sank in the Patuxent River 16 December 1942.

The former was transferred to the Royal Navy 4 November 1941 and renamed as RMS &quot;P.551&quot; then transferred to the Polish Navy in exile and renamed . On 2 May 1942 she was attacked in a friendly fire incident by a Royal Navy minesweeper and destroyer and sank with all hands.

, originally commissioned on 16 December 1918 and decommissioned after more than 12 years of service, was recommissioned and served for five additional years during World War II. &quot;R-1&quot; was decommissioned at Key West on 20 September 1945 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 November. Still at Key West awaiting disposal on 21 February 1946, the submarine sank in of water. Raised three days later, she was sold for scrap on 13 March 1946.

 was decommissioned on 6 February 1945, was stripped, and her hulk was supposed to be expended as a target for aerial bombing off San Diego, California, but she broke her tow cable and sank, coming to rest in some of water, on 20 February 1945. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register three days later. Salvagers unsuccessfully tried to retrieve the wreck of &quot;S-37&quot; for her scrap value, but lost her again off Imperial Beach, California, in of water at , where she remains to this day.

== After World War II ==

=== Additional incidents ===
 was decommissioned on 15 November 1945 and sold for scrap 8 June 1957. The &quot;Tarpon&quot; foundered in deep water, south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on 26 August 1957, while under tow to the scrap yard.

 flooded and sank pier-side prior to commissioning at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 15 May 1969. Two shipyard teams, apparently unaware of each other&#x27;s efforts, were conducting work involving filling tanks in both the forward and aft portions of the submarine. Eventually the lack of coordination led to flooding through the bow hatch. The submarine was raised, but completion was delayed 32 months. &quot;Guitarro&quot; was commissioned on 9 September 1972.

 was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register 1 October 1970. On 1 June 1971, while under tow near Cape Flattery, Washington state, &quot;Bugara&quot; swamped and sank accidentally.

 was not repaired after a fire near Florida on 24 April 1988 that killed three crewmembers. She was decommissioned 28 September 1988 and hulked 17 August 1989. The hull was later purchased by Northrop Grumman for testing.

 experienced a fire during overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 23 May 2012 that caused significant damage, though with no loss of life. A civilian shipyard worker confessed to arson. Although repairs were considered, using components from the decommissioned , the estimated cost of $700 million was considered uneconomical in a time of reduced budgets. &quot;Miami&quot; was decommissioned on 28 March 2014, to be disposed of via the nuclear Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.

<doc id="416038" wikidata="Q1057522" url="?curid=416038" title="Plush">
<text>Plush (from French ) is a textile having a cut nap or pile the same as fustian or velvet. Its softness of feel gave rise to the adjective &quot;plush&quot; to describe something soft or luxurious, which was extended to describe luxury accommodation, or something rich and full. This has also been known to be described as früh, or middlefrüh in more affordable varieties.

Originally the pile of plush consisted of mohair or worsted yarn, but now silk by itself or with a cotton backing is used for plush, the distinction from velvet being found in the longer and less dense pile of plush. The soft material is largely used for upholstery and furniture purposes, and is also much employed in dress and millinery.

Modern plush are commonly manufactured from synthetic fibres such as polyester. One of the largest uses of this fabric is in the production of stuffed toys, with small plush toys made from plush fabric, such as teddy bears, to the point these are often addressed as &quot;plush toys&quot; or &quot;plushies&quot; in North American English. Plush is also one of the main materials for the construction of designer toys.

<doc id="416040" wikidata="Q2707030" url="?curid=416040" title="Island night lizard">
<text>The island night lizard (Xantusia riversiana) is a species of lizard in the family Xantusiidae. The species is native to three of the Channel Islands of California: San Nicolas Island, Santa Barbara Island, and San Clemente Island. A small population of the island night lizard also lives on Sutil Island, near Santa Barbara Island.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;riversiana&quot;, is in honor of (1824–1913), a London-born physician and naturalist, who was Curator of Natural History at the University of California.

==Subspecies==
The San Clemente Island population is a subspecies which is recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Xantusia riversiana reticulata&quot; – San Clemente night lizard

==Conservation status==
The island night lizard was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the United States since 1977; the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as vulnerable. In 2006, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the administrating agency for the ESA, removed the San Clemente subspecies from the ESA. Better control of munitions-sparked wildfires may have been a reason. In March 2014, The US Fish and Wildlife Service removed the species from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife. This removal was attributed to the removal of non-native animals such as cats and goats from the islands and partnering between the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the US Navy.

==Habitat==
The island night lizard&#x27;s preferred habitat is coastal scrub made up of dense boxthorn and cacti thickets.

==Reproduction==
Like other night lizards of the family Xantisiidae, the island night lizard is ovoviviparous, bearing live young rather than laying eggs. 

==Description==
The island night lizard is much larger than another species in the genus &quot;Xantusia&quot;, the desert night lizard (&quot;Xantusia vigilis&quot;) of southern California. The island night lizard is typically between in length, not including the tail. It typically lives between 11 and 13 years, but some individuals are estimated to have lived 30 years or more. Its color varies from pale ash gray and beige to brown and black. It may have a uniform, mottled, or striped pattern.

<text>A pocket is a bag- or envelope-like receptacle either fastened to or inserted in an article of clothing to hold small items. Pockets are also attached to luggage, backpacks, and similar items. In older usage, a pocket was a separate small bag or pouch.

==Origins==
Ancient people used leather or cloth pouches to hold valuables. Ötzi (also called the &quot;Iceman&quot;), who lived around 3,300 BCE, had a belt with a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, drill, flint flake, bone awl, and a dried tinder fungus.

In European clothing, fitchets, resembling modern day pockets, appeared in the 13th century. Vertical slits were cut in the super tunic, which did not have any side openings, to allow access to purse or keys slung from the girdle of the tunic. According to historian Rebecca Unsworth, it was in the late 15th century that pockets became more noticeable. During the 16th century, pockets increased in popularity and prevalence.

In slightly later European clothing, pockets began by being hung like purses from a belt, which could be concealed beneath a coat or jerkin to discourage pickpocketing and reached through a slit in the outer garment.

In the 17th century, pockets began to be sewn into men&#x27;s clothing, but not women&#x27;s, which continued to be tied on and hidden under the large skirts popular at the time. 
The word appears in Middle English as &quot;pocket&quot;, and is taken from a Norman diminutive of Old French &quot;poke&quot;, &quot;pouque&quot;, modern &quot;poche&quot;, cf. pouch. The form &quot;poke&quot; is now only used in dialect, or in such proverbial sayings as &quot;a pig in a poke&quot;.

Historically, the term &quot;pocket&quot; referred to a pouch worn around the waist by women in the 17th to 19th centuries, mentioned in the rhyme &quot;Lucy Locket&quot;. In these pockets, women would carry items needed in their daily lives, such as scissors, pins and needles, and keys.

In more modern clothing, while men&#x27;s clothes generally have pockets, those designed to be worn by women often do not - and sometimes have what are called Potemkin pockets (from Potemkin village), a fake slit sewn shut. If there are pockets they are often much smaller than in men&#x27;s clothes. Journalists at the Pudding found less than half of women’s front pockets could fit a thin wallet, let alone a phone and keys.

==Types==
A watch pocket or fob pocket is a small pocket designed to hold a pocket watch, sometimes found in men&#x27;s trousers and waistcoats and in traditional blue jeans. However, due to the decline in popularity of pocket watches, these pockets are rarely used for their original intended purpose.

A besom pocket or slit pocket is a pocket cut into a garment instead of being sewn on. These pockets often have reinforced piping along the slit of the pocket, appearing perhaps as an extra piece of fabric or stitching. Besom pockets are found on a tuxedo jacket or trousers and may be accented with a flap or button closure.

Camp pockets or cargo pockets are pockets which have been sewn to the outside of the garment. They are usually squared off and are characterized by seaming.

A beer pocket is a small pocket within a jacket or vest sized specifically for transporting a bottle of beer. It came into fashion in the 1910s in select areas of the American midwest, prior to Prohibition, after which it faded into relative obscurity before experiencing minor revivals in the 1980s and early 2000s.

<text>Arthur Nicholas Winston Soames, Baron Soames of Fletching, (born 12 February 1948) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Sussex from 1997 to 2019, having previously served as the MP for Crawley from 1983 to 1997.

Soames was Minister of State for the Armed Forces from 1994 to 1997 in the government of John Major. He had the whip removed on 3 September 2019, for voting against the government, before it was restored on 29 October. His main political interests are defence, international relations, rural affairs and industry. He is a grandson of former prime minister Winston Churchill.

==Early life, education and military service==
Soames was born in 1948 in Croydon, Surrey, the eldest son of Sir Christopher Soames and Dame Mary (née Spencer-Churchill) Soames. He is a grandson of the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and a grandnephew of Lady Baden-Powell, World Chief Guide, the wife of the founder of the Scout movement, Lord Baden-Powell. Industrialist Rupert Soames is Soames&#x27;s brother, and journalist Emma Soames is a sister.

Simon Hoggart, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, related an anecdote of Soames&#x27; childhood: &quot;He gave me the true version of what I had always suspected was an apocryphal story. In or around 1953, when Soames was five, he didn&#x27;t know how important his grandfather was until someone told him. So he walked up to the old man&#x27;s bedroom, managed to get past the valets and the secretaries, and found him sitting up in bed.
&#x27;Is it true, grandpapa, that you are the greatest man in the world?&#x27; he asked.
&#x27;Yes, I am,&#x27; said Churchill. &#x27;Now bugger off.&#x27;&quot;

After attending St. Aubyns Preparatory School in Sussex, Soames received his secondary education at Eton College. Later he studied at Mons Officer Cadet School before being commissioned into the 11th Hussars on 5 August 1967 on a Short Service Commission before serving in West Germany and Britain with the 11th Hussars and later the Royal Hussars. Soames was transferred to Regular Army Reserve of Officers on 9 March 1970 before resigning his commission on 5 August 1975.

==Early career==
In 1970, he was appointed equerry to Charles, Prince of Wales (now Charles III); he has remained a close friend of the King ever since, and publicly criticised Diana, Princess of Wales, during the couple&#x27;s estrangement. When Diana first accused the Prince of Wales of adultery with Camilla Parker Bowles, Soames told the BBC that the accusation, and Diana&#x27;s fear of being slandered by her husband&#x27;s courtiers, stemmed merely from Diana&#x27;s mental illness, and &quot;the advanced stages of paranoia&quot;. Charles later admitted his adultery and Soames apologised.

In 1972, he left Kensington Palace and the army to work as a stockbroker. In 1974, he became a personal assistant; first to Sir James Goldsmith and then in 1976 to United States Senator Mark Hatfield, whose employ he left in 1978 to become a director of Bland Welch, Lloyd&#x27;s Brokers. Between 1979 and 1981, he was an assistant director of the Sedgwick Group. He fought Central Dunbartonshire in Scotland in 1979, where Labour&#x27;s Hugh McCartney defeated him by 12,003 votes.

==Parliamentary career==
Soames was elected as the MP for Crawley at the 1983 general election. He sat for Crawley until the 1997 general election (when Labour defeated the Conservatives in Crawley). In the 1997 election, he retained the constituency of Mid Sussex for the Conservatives after Tim Renton stood down at the election, and Soames remained the seat&#x27;s MP from then until Parliament was dissolved in November 2019.

He served as a Parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food between 1992 and 1994, as Minister of State for the Armed Forces at the Ministry of Defence under Prime Minister John Major between 1994 and 1997, and later as the Shadow Secretary of State for Defence from 2003 to 2005.

In 2002 he was appointed to the parliamentary committee considering the future Hunting Act 2004 that banned hunting with dogs, a policy which he opposed.

On 9 May 2005, shortly after Michael Howard announced his intention to resign as leader of the Conservative Party, Soames resigned from the shadow cabinet.

With Frank Field he is a co-chairman of the Cross-Party Group on Balanced Migration, and has advocated in parliament and in the media that immigration to and emigration from the UK should be brought into balance. In parliament he has also spoken in favour of the introduction of a national identity card scheme and advocated them in the national media.

Soames was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 EU membership referendum. In an interview before the referendum he described himself as a One Nation Tory on the soft right of the party, and compared Brexiteers to &#x27;a growling Alsatian that must be kicked really hard in the balls&#x27;.

In April 2019, Soames condemned the United States for recognizing Israel&#x27;s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights. Soames said it was &quot;a matter of the greatest regret that our allies, the United States, are in clear contravention of UN Resolution 497&quot;, adding that &quot;annexation of territory is prohibited under international law.&quot;

Soames endorsed Rory Stewart during the 2019 Conservative leadership election.

===Allegations of sexism===

According to the book &quot;Women in Parliament&quot; published in 2005, Soames has been named as the most prolific source of vulgar and sexist comments in the Houses of Parliament, with several female MPs stating that he has made vulgar comments to them. Soames regarded the claims as &#x27;nonsense&#x27;. Barbara Follett said in 2007 that Soames was the worst of the sexist MPs in parliament.

On 31 January 2017, Soames made &#x27;woofing&#x27; noises at Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh when she was asking the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, a question in the House of Commons. Ahmed-Sheikh called a point of order to bring the speaker&#x27;s attention to the noises. John Bercow, the speaker, described the noises as &quot;discourteous and that expression should not be used&quot;, and Soames was asked to apologise. He did so, saying he was only offering her a &quot;friendly canine salute&quot; in reply to her &quot;snapped&quot; question.

===Removal and restoration of whip===

On 3 September 2019, Soames joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson and pass a motion allowing backbenchers to take control of the House of Commons timetable in order to pass a bill to stop a no-deal exit from the EU without parliamentary approval. Effectively, they helped block Johnson&#x27;s Brexit plan from proceeding on 31 October. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs, requiring them to sit as independents. If Soames had decided to stand for re-election in a future election, the party would have blocked his selection as a Conservative candidate.

Soames announced that he would not be standing in the 2019 general election. On 29 October, Boris Johnson restored the whip for him and 9 other MPs.

==Inheritance tax relief==
In one edition of &quot;The Mark Thomas Comedy Product&quot;, Mark Thomas investigated the practice of avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Soames was claiming tax relief on a &quot;three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports&quot; on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a &#x27;National Soames Day&#x27; on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. In 2015, Thomas told &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Adam Jacques: &quot;I try to find the good in my enemies. It&#x27;s not unusual to be able to get on with people despite what they are doing being awful. The only person I have met who I considered to be without any redeeming features was [...] Nicholas Soames. [...] He was such a pantomime baddie.&quot;

==Aegis Defence Services==
Soames was chairman of the private security contractor Aegis Defence Services which was bought in 2015 by GardaWorld, for whom he now acts as a member of the International Advisory Board. Aegis had a series of contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to provide guards to protect US military bases in Iraq from 2004 onwards. From 2011, the company broadened its recruitment to take in African countries, having previously employed people from the UK, the US and Nepal.

Contract documents say that the soldiers from Sierra Leone were paid $16 (£11) a day. A documentary, &quot;The Child Soldier&#x27;s New Job&quot;, broadcast in Denmark, alleges that the estimated 2,500 Sierra Leonean personnel who were recruited by Aegis and other private security companies to work in Iraq included former child soldiers.

==Other outside interests==
He was a director of the liquidated company Framlington Second Dual Trust plc.

Soames is listed as a director of The Amber Foundation.

He was invited to ride in the King&#x27;s procession at Royal Ascot 2023.

Soames also has a position as a senior advisor at Francis Maude Associates, a consultancy set up by Francis Maude.

He was an honorary colonel of the C (Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry) Squadron The Royal Yeomanry until 5 October 2023.

==Political funding==
Mid Sussex Conservative Constituency Association has received over £1 million in donations, with Soames receiving well over £100,000 from private military company Aegis Defence Services Ltd from 2010 onwards. US multinational professional services, risk management and insurance brokerage firm Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc has given Soames £518,069 since 2010 in remunerations for his services as an MP. Soames has also received private donations from a variety of people, including £5,749 from Majlis As Shura, £10,000 from David Rowland, and £20,000 from Ann R. Said.

==Meeting with Robert Mugabe==
In October 2017, Soames was criticised by Labour MP Kate Hoey following a meeting with President Robert Mugabe while visiting Zimbabwe (formerly Southern Rhodesia). Zimbabwean media reported that the visit was &quot;part of a private initiative of friends of Zimbabwe in the British establishment&quot; to normalise relations between the two countries. Hoey, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Zimbabwe, said that Soames&#x27; visit &quot;pander[ed] to the vanity of a wily and ruthless dictator. [...] You can&#x27;t have a private visit which is then front page of the newspapers in Zimbabwe.&quot; In response, Soames maintained that he had met Mugabe in a personal capacity, rather than as a representative of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government. He said that his father, Lord Soames, who had overseen Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s transition to independence as Zimbabwe, would not have forgiven him if he had not tried to meet the President.

==Peerage==
It was announced on 14 October 2022, that as part of the 2022 Political Honours, Soames would be appointed a life peer. On 28 October 2022, he was created Baron Soames of Fletching, &quot;of Fletching in the County of East Sussex&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Soames has been married twice. On 4 June 1981, he married Catherine Weatherall (sister of Percy Weatherall and Isobel, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne) at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. The Prince of Wales served as best man and the wedding was attended by The Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and Lady Diana Spencer. They had one son before divorcing in 1988:
* Arthur Harry David Soames (b. May 1985)

His second marriage was on 21 December 1993 to Serena Smith (a niece of The Duchess of Grafton and daughter of Sir John Smith). They have two children:
* Isabella Soames (b. 28 November 1996)
* Christopher Soames (b. 11 January 2001)

His brother, Rupert Soames, is the CEO of outsourcing company Serco.

===Driving offences===
On 15 May 2008, Soames pleaded guilty to riding a quad bike on a public road without motor insurance. Since he had several previous offences on his licence, he was disqualified from driving for two months, fined £200, and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and costs of £35 by magistrates.

In 2012, he was disqualified from driving for a fortnight for speeding at 51 mph in a 30 mph residential area. Soames was also fined £666, plus £85 court costs and a £15 victim surcharge. According to &quot;The Argus&quot;, a Sussex paper, it was &quot;the third time he has been caught flouting traffic laws in four years&quot;.

==Honours==

* On 13 July 2011, Soames was sworn of the Privy Council. This gave him the honorific prefix &quot;the Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* He was knighted in the 2014 Birthday Honours for political service.

<text>Sir Nicholas Raymond Winterton (born 31 March 1938) is a retired British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Macclesfield from 1971 until he retired from the House of Commons at the 2010 general election.

His wife, Ann Winterton, also served as a Member of Parliament, representing the neighbouring Congleton constituency from 1983 to 2010.

==Early life==
Winterton was born in Rugeley, Staffordshire and was educated at Bilton Grange, a prep school in Rugby, then Rugby School. He undertook his National Service from 1957 to 1959 and was commissioned into the 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars serving in Germany before leaving to work as a trainee sales executive with Shell-Mex and BP.

In 1960, he became a Sales and General Manager of a construction machinery company, a job he retained until he was elected to Parliament. He served as a member of the West Midlands Conservative Council from 1967 to 1971 and was a Warwickshire County Councillor representing a coal mining and industrial division in North Warwickshire from 1967 to 1972. In 1969 he contested a by-election in Newcastle-under-Lyme but was unsuccessful; he stood again for the same seat at the 1970 general election but again was unsuccessful.

==Member of Parliament==
Winterton was elected to the House of Commons at the third attempt, winning a by-election in Macclesfield in September 1971. He is considered a right-wing Conservative, opposing the reduction of the age of consent for same-sex sexual relations to 16, the ban on fox hunting and supporting Section 28 and the reintroduction of capital punishment.

For some years he was a member of the Conservative Monday Club and on 26 January 1981, he was the Guest-of-Honour at the club&#x27;s Africa Group Dinner at St Stephen&#x27;s Club, Westminster, where Harold Soref was in the chair. He is also a signatory to The Freedom Association&#x27;s Better Off Out campaign, opposing Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Union. He wears a small badge in the design of the pound sterling symbol to signify his opposition to any plans for the Euro being adopted as Britain&#x27;s national currency. In the late 1980s he was with several other MPs a member of the parliamentary advisory board of the Western Goals Institute.

Although never promoted to a ministerial or shadow role, he served as a member of the Social services Select committee between 1979 and 1990 and was then chairman of the Health Select Committee (1990–92). Winterton was a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen. He was also a member of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons and served as a vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee. Winterton was one of the few MPs to ask a question at Tony Blair&#x27;s last Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions: he demanded a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. He was knighted by Elizabeth II in the 2002 Birthday Honours for services to Parliament.

The Wintertons were investigated by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner and he concluded that they misused their MPs&#x27; expenses to pay rent for a flat that they had already bought outright. Once the mortgage had been fully repaid, the Wintertons transferred the ownership of the flat into a family trust. Since 2002 they had paid the rent to their trust for living in the flat from their MPs&#x27; expenditure. The Committee accepted that the Wintertons had &quot;at no stage attempted to conceal their arrangements&quot;. Winterton said of his expenses: &quot;I try to tackle matters of expenses in a responsible way, I don&#x27;t spend any more money than is absolutely necessary&quot;. This was at odds with his party&#x27;s leader, David Cameron, who described them as &quot;indefensible&quot;. On 25 May 2009 it was announced that both the Wintertons would stand down as MPs at the next general election.

Winterton was accused of slapping Labour MP Natascha Engel&#x27;s bottom. When asked if the accusation was true, Winterton replied: &quot;I&#x27;m quite a normal person. Will I slap a colleague on the back, Will I slap a colleague in friendship? The answer is – it is certainly possible.&quot;

On 18 February 2010 during a BBC Radio 5 Live interview he defended MPs travelling first class by saying that people who travelled in standard class on trains were a &quot;totally different type of people.&quot; Commenting to a BBC reporter, a Conservative spokesman stated that these remarks &quot;...do not in any way represent the views of [...] the Conservative Party.&quot;

==Affiliations==
Sir Nicholas Winterton has been involved in a wide range of organisations and interests. Local charities he supports include the Macclesfield Access Group, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Riding for the Disabled, Macclesfield Handicapped Social Club and the Rossendale Trust. He is a vice president of the East Cheshire Hospice and a patron of the local branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. For 30 years he has been a patron of the Macclesfield &amp; District Sheep Dog Trials Association. He also helps local organisations such as Age Concern and Macmillan Cancer Care and is an honorary member of the Macclesfield &amp; District Lions Club. He is a supporter of Macclesfield Town F.C. and Macclesfield R.U.F.C.

Winterton is also actively involved with local Scouting and Guiding. He is a vice president of Cheshire Scout County and Macclesfield and Congleton District Scout Council. He is an ambassador for Guiding by Girlguiding UK. In recognition of his contribution to Scouting he has been awarded the Medal of Merit for Outstanding Services to the Scout Movement.

For 26 years he was on The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award Scheme National Advisory Committee. He is an honorary Vice-President of the Royal College of Midwives and a freeman of the City of London. He is also a Past Upper Bailiff and Member of Court of the Worshipful Company of Weavers. As a result of many years supporting St John Ambulance Winterton is a Serving Brother of the Venerable Order of Saint John. He is Patron/Chairman of the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia Relief Fund, a registered charity.

==Personal life==
Winterton is married to Ann Winterton. In the 1983 general election she became the Member of Parliament for Congleton, adjacent to his Macclesfield constituency. They have two children, including one daughter, Sarah.

==Honors==
In 2009 Winterton was made a Freeman of the Borough of Macclesfield.

<text>Jane Ann, Lady Winterton (&quot;née&quot; Hodgson; born 6 March 1941 in Sutton Coldfield) is a retired British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Congleton from 1983 to 2010. She is married to Sir Nicholas Winterton, also a former Conservative MP.

== Parliamentary career ==
Winterton was educated at Erdington Grammar School for Girls. Following her election to represent Congleton in 1983, she was a member of several select committees, including Agriculture (1987–1997), the chairman&#x27;s panel (1992–1998) and the National Drug Strategy (1998–2001), Social Security (2000–2001) and the Unopposed Bills Panel from 1997. She is a representative of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and a patron of Cheshire National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. She is also president of the Congleton Pantomime Society.

===Racism===
Winterton became Shadow Minister for Agriculture in 2001, and was later sacked from that position after she told the following joke at a dinner at Congleton rugby club on 3 May 2002:

:An Englishman, a Cuban, a Japanese man and a Pakistani were all on a train.
:The Cuban threw a fine Havana cigar out the window. When he was asked why, he replied: &quot;They are ten a penny in my country.&quot;
:The Japanese man threw an expensive Nikon camera out of the carriage, adding: &quot;These are ten a penny in my country.&quot;
:The Englishman then picked up the Pakistani and threw him out of the train window.
:When the other travellers asked him to account for his actions, he said: &quot;They are ten a penny in my country.&quot;&#x27;

In February 2004 she had the Conservative whip removed for telling the following joke (which alluded to the recent death of twenty-three illegal immigrant Chinese cockle-pickers in Morecambe Bay) at a Whitehall private dinner party to improve Denmark–United Kingdom relations and declining to apologise:

:One shark turned to the other to say he was fed up chasing tuna and the other said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we go to Morecambe Bay and get some Chinese?&quot;

A month later, Winterton apologised for the joke, and had the whip restored. Lord Taylor of Warwick, the only black Conservative peer in the House of Lords, criticised the decision to restore the whip and said she was not fit to be an MP.

Nick Palmer, then Labour MP for Broxtowe, who was at the dinner, criticised the joke and told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;People were a bit stunned really. It was a very low-key friendly dinner. I was very sorry for the host – it was just a group of people discussing Danish issues.&quot;

Michael Howard, leader of the Conservatives, said, &quot;Ann Winterton&#x27;s remarks about the tragic deaths in Morecambe Bay were completely unacceptable. Such sentiments have no place in the Conservative Party. I deplore them and I apologise for them on behalf of my party.&quot;

In September 2005 (following the May general election), Winterton said she felt that Britain is a country where:

:&quot;Crime is out of control ... and where thousands of illegal immigrants are waved in with no checks on whether they are criminals or potential terrorists. [...] We live in times of tremendous change, but the United Kingdom is still, thankfully, a predominantly white, Christian country. [...] Some might say we are now paying the price for the so-called &#x27;benefits&#x27; of the multicultural society, the product of almost uncontrolled immigration and the abuse of asylum.&quot;

Along with her husband, she managed to ask questions at Tony Blair&#x27;s last Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in 2007.

== MPs&#x27; misuse of expenses ==

Together with Nicholas Winterton, Ann Winterton was investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who concluded that they had misused their MPs&#x27; expenses to pay rent for a flat that they had already bought outright. The Wintertons transferred the ownership of the flat into a family trust to avoid the inheritance tax threshold. Since 2002, they had paid the rent for living in the flat from their MPs&#x27; expenditure. The Wintertons had declared their intentions to the Commons&#x27; Fees Office. On 25 May 2009, it was announced that both the Wintertons would stand down as MPs at the following general election. Winterton was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs&#x27; expense details secret.

<doc id="416058" wikidata="Q2088170" url="?curid=416058" title="Expedition of Tabuk">
<text>The Expedition of Tabuk, also known as the Expedition of Usra, was a military expedition that was initiated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in October 630 CE (AH 9). He led a force of as many as 30,000 north to Tabuk, near the Gulf of Aqaba, in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia.

==Preparations==
Following rumours of a Byzantine invasion, the Muslims and allies of Muhammad received an urgent call to join the campaign, but the Arabs of the desert showed little interest. Many came up with excuses not to participate. Muhammad provided incentives to persuade the Arabs to join and provided many with gifts.

==Expedition==
Muhammad and his forces marched northwards to Tabuk, near the Gulf of Aqaba in October 630 (Rajab AH 9). It was his largest and last military expedition. Ali ibn Abi Talib, who participated in several other expeditions of Muhammad, did not participate in Muhammad&#x27;s Tabuk expedition upon Muhammad&#x27;s instructions, as he held command at Medina. Muhammad spent twenty days at Tabuk, scouting the area, making alliances with local chiefs. With no sign of the Byzantine army, he decided to return to Medina. Though Muhammad did not encounter a Byzantine army at Tabuk, according to the &quot;Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World&quot;, &quot;this show of force demonstrated his intention to challenge the Byzantines for control of the northern part of the caravan route from Mecca to Syria&quot;.

<doc id="416059" wikidata="Q7324235" url="?curid=416059" title="Richard Body">
<text>Sir Richard Bernard Frank Stewart Body (18 May 1927 – 26 February 2018) was an English politician. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Billericay from 1955 to 1959, for Holland with Boston from 1966 to 1997, and for Boston and Skegness from 1997 until he stood down at the 2001 general election. He was a long-standing member of the Conservative Monday Club, and came second in its 1972 election for chairman. A prominent eurosceptic, Body also served as president of the Anti-Common Market League.

==Family background and early life==
Sir Richard was born in Datchet, then in Buckinghamshire, in 1927, the son of Bernard Richard Body and his wife, Daphne (formerly Corbett). His father was from a Berkshire family resident in Shinfield since the 1720s. Through his paternal grandmother, he was a third cousin of theatre director Val May. He attended the Reading School, and later the Inns of Court School of Law. He married the former Marion Graham in 1959, and they had a son and a daughter. Lady Body was a friend and Bletchley Park colleague of Valerie Middleton, the grandmother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. He served in the Royal Air Force towards the end of World War II.

==Career==
Before finally gaining election at Billericay in 1955, Body had fought several elections across the country without success. He was the Conservative candidate for Deptford at the 1949 London County Council election, then Rotherham in the 1950 United Kingdom general election, Abertillery in a by-election that same year, and then Leek in 1951.

In January 1973, Body was an opponent of Prime Minister Edward Heath&#x27;s Counter-Inflation Bill, stating that the real cause of inflation was too much government spending. Within the Tory party his doubts were shared by Enoch Powell, Ronald Bell and Nicholas Ridley, the last of whom complained that what was needed was a &quot;proper economic policy&quot;.

Rural Buckinghamshire-born, and representing fertile South Holland, Body was an early supporter of environmental causes within the Conservative Party. Coming from a British agriculture perspective, he was highly critical of many aspects associated with the heavily subsidised agriculture associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Economic Community (EEC). His &quot;Agriculture: The Triumph and the Shame&quot;, a non-fictional agricultural book exposing, it asserted, its folly, was published in 1983, followed by &quot;Farming in the Clouds&quot; (1984). He was also critical over the use of pesticides in agriculture, and led an inquiry on the issue in 1986–87. The enquiry produced a draft report which contained 45 recommendations, mostly influenced by his support for organic farming and use of such methods on his own farms. The report was ignored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which made no response and did not attempt to alter its own favoured methods. Between 1984 and 1993, Body (under the pseudonym &quot;Old Muckspreader&quot;) also wrote the &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; column in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, in which he regularly criticised both CAP and environmental mismanagement of farms.

He was knighted in 1986.

Body was generally regarded as of the &quot;Old Right&quot; of the party, and often found himself at odds with the John Major government and its predecessor, including those influenced by it, who had come to dominate the parliamentary Conservative Party by the mid-1990s. He made such views clear in March 2001, shortly before he retired as an MP, writing in the parliamentary magazine &quot;The House&quot; that the rural and, specifically, the agricultural communities of Britain were the victims of major changes to the culture at Westminster in his time in the Commons, as the number of Tory MPs from landowning or farming backgrounds had declined and the number of self-made men from the suburbs on the Tory benches had increased.

In 1993, Body was tricked into believing he was speaking on the telephone with John Major by the impressionist-comedian Rory Bremner. The incident prompted Cabinet Secretary Robin Butler to warn Channel 4 head Michael Grade against any further calls for fear that state secrets could be inadvertently leaked.

In his later years as an MP, Body clearly distanced himself from an increasingly economic-rationalist and internationalist Tory party by associating himself with a number of environmentalist groups who disapproved of large national or free trade groupings and supported smaller, more &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; communities. He has been associated with such long-standing figures of the green movement such as Edward Goldsmith, John Seymour, and John Papworth. Unlike the vast majority of Conservative MPs, Body voted to equalise the age of consent for homosexuals, and also supported the legalisation of cannabis. He called for an English Parliament in his book &quot;England for the English&quot;, published in April 2001.

Body&#x27;s fervent euroscepticism led to him being numbered amongst the rebellious &quot;bastards&quot; condemned by John Major in 1993. His actions regarding Europe eventually led to his resigning the Conservative whip for a temporary period. He authored multiple eurosceptic books, including &quot;A Europe of Many Circles&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Breakdown of Europe&quot; (1998) (which deliberately echoed the title of Leopold Kohr&#x27;s book &quot;The Breakdown of Nations&quot;).

On 10 November 1999, Body put forward an Early Day Motion in support of the writer Robert Henderson, who believed that the security services had interfered with his mail and telephone line after he had written allegedly threatening letters to Prime Minister Tony Blair, his wife Cherie, and various Labour MPs. This followed an article by Henderson in &quot;Wisden Cricket Monthly&quot; in 1995 entitled &quot;Is it in the blood?&quot; which suggested that only &quot;unequivocal Englishmen&quot; should play cricket for England. Body&#x27;s motion not only defended Henderson and accused Blair of interfering with Henderson&#x27;s activities, but referred to &quot;publicly reported incidents of racism within the Labour Party&quot;.

==Later life==
Body joined the UK Independence Party in 2004, but left UKIP for the English Democrats by 2008. He was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

Body died at his home in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, on 26 February 2018 at the age of 90.

<doc id="416063" wikidata="Q7702150" url="?curid=416063" title="Teresa Gorman">
<text>Teresa Ellen Gorman (; 30 September 1931 – 28 August 2015) was a British politician. She was Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Billericay, in the county of Essex, from 1987 to 2001 when she stood down. She was a leading figure in the rebellions over the Maastricht Treaty that nearly brought down John Major&#x27;s government. She worked in both education and business.

== Early life ==
Gorman was born Teresa Ellen Moore in Putney, London, England. Her father was a demolition contractor, her mother a waitress. She was educated at Fulham County School in London, leaving the all-girls grammar school at 16, at her parents&#x27; insistence to start work. She then trained to teach at Brighton Teacher Training College, qualifying in 1951. While working as a teacher, she studied biology and zoology part-time at University College London, graduating with first class honours.

After marrying her first husband, James Gorman, whose surname she would keep throughout her life, she worked on an exchange programme in New York City. Besides teaching she ran a business selling teaching aids, Banta, and was involved in property development with her first husband.

== Political career ==
Under her maiden name Moore, Gorman attempted to enter the House of Commons as an Independent candidate for the Conservative-held seat of Streatham in the October 1974 general election, polling 210 votes. In the same year she founded (and later chaired) the Alliance of Small Firms &amp; Self-Employed People. She later sat as an elected member of Westminster City Council from 1982 to 1986.

Gorman was elected to the House of Commons in the 1987 election. When she sought the candidature for Billericay in 1986, she claimed to have been born in 1941, aged 45, rather than 1931, aged 55, believing this would increase her chances. The night after she was elected she appeared on a notable edition of the Channel 4 late-night discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; when she &quot;stormed off the set&quot;.

In the 1990 party leadership election she voted for John Major to succeed Margaret Thatcher but four years later she was one of the Maastricht Rebels, who nearly brought down Major&#x27;s government over the Maastricht Treaty.

In 1992, Gorman introduced an amendment to the Representation of the People Act under the Ten Minute Rule to give two seats to each constituency, one for a male MP and one for a female. The amendment received only a first reading. She was a prominent figure in the group of Conservative rebels over European issues. In 1994, she had the Conservative whip withdrawn for refusing to back the EC Finance Bill.

At the 1997 general election, there was a massive swing towards her opponent, but she remained an MP, with a much-reduced majority of 1,356. Surprisingly she backed pro-Euro Kenneth Clarke in the 1997 Conservative Party leadership election when she was expected to back William Hague or John Redwood who she backed two years earlier for the party leadership, describing him as &quot;a bad-mannered, insensitive snob whose remarks on single mothers were a disaster&quot;.

She tried to stand for the Conservative Mayor of London candidacy for the 2000 London mayoral election, but was blocked by the party leadership.

In February 2000, she was suspended from the House of Commons for a month for failing to disclose on the Register of Members Interests between 1987 and 1994 three rented properties in south London and for her failure to register two rented-out properties in Portugal from 1987 to 1999. The Commons&#x27; Standards and Privileges Committee also found she should not have introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill in 1990 proposing the repeal of the Rent Acts without registering and declaring a financial interest.

Considered an able but maverick politician, Gorman was known for her public endorsement of hormone replacement therapy her tattooed eyebrows (she shaved them off as a teenager and they never grew back) and her belief that rapists should be castrated.

During the 2012 Local elections, it was reported that Gorman was supporting the UK Independence Party in her home area of Thurrock.

Gorman was a council member of the Freedom Association. She was interviewed about her membership of the association and the rise of Thatcherism for the BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot; (2006).

=== Censure by the House of Commons Standards &amp; Privileges Committee ===
Gorman was censured by the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee for a failure to declare a relevant interest and other breaches of the code of conduct.

The committee found that she failed to declare that her husband Jim Gorman owned three properties in London when she proposed the repeal of the Rents Act. Moreover, during its investigation the privileges committee MPs found she gave &quot;seriously misleading and inaccurate information&quot;, breached the code of conduct for members and improperly contacted witnesses. She subsequently announced her resignation from Parliament, although her retirement was also influenced by caring for her husband Jim, who had cancer.

== Personal life ==

Teresa and James Gorman were married on 18 October 1952. He died of cancer in 2008. On her birthday in 2010, she married Peter Clarke, a Scottish widower, who survived her until January 2017. Clarke was a columnist for &quot;Private Eye&quot; and a wildlife activist.

She had no children. In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (2014) she did not detail her marital status beyond &quot;married&quot;.

Gorman had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She died from end-stage dementia on 28 August 2015 at a nursing home in Grays, Essex, England.

<doc id="416074" wikidata="Q1255067" url="?curid=416074" title="Tarasios of Constantinople">
<text>Tarasios of Constantinople (also &quot;Saint Tarasius&quot; and &quot;Saint Tarasios&quot;; ; 730 – 25 February 806) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 25 December 784 until his death on 25 February 806.

== Background ==
Tarasios was born and raised in the city of Constantinople. A son of a high-ranking judge, Tarasios was related to important families, including that of the later Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople. He had an elder brother, Sisinnios, who was captured during the invasion of Calabria in 788–789.

Tarasios had embarked on a career in the secular administration and had attained the rank of senator, eventually becoming imperial secretary (&quot;asekretis&quot;) to the Emperor Constantine VI and his mother, the Empress Irene of Athens. When Patriarch Paul IV of Constantinople retired to a monastery, he recommended the lay administrator Tarasios as his successor.

Since Tarasios exhibited both Iconodule sympathies and the willingness to follow imperial commands when they were not contrary to the faith, he was selected as Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople by Empress Irene in 784, even though he was a layman at the time. Nevertheless, like all educated Byzantines, he was well versed in theology, and the election of qualified laymen as bishops was not unheard of in the history of the Church.

He reluctantly accepted, on condition that church unity would be restored with Rome and the Oriental Patriarchs, and a council be called to address the iconoclast controversy. To make him eligible for the office of patriarch, Tarasios was duly ordained to the deaconate and then the priesthood, prior to his consecration as bishop.

== Second Council of Nicaea ==
Before accepting the dignity of Patriarch, Tarasios had demanded and obtained the promise that the veneration of icons would be restored in the church. As a part of his policy of improving relations with Rome, he persuaded Empress Irene to write to Pope Adrian I, inviting him to send delegates to Constantinople for a new council, to repudiate heresy. The Pope agreed to send delegates, although he disapproved of the appointment of a layman to the patriarchate. The council convened in the Church of the Holy Apostles on 17 August 786. Mutinous troops burst into the church and dispersed the delegates. The shaken papal legates at once took ship for Rome. The mutinous troops were removed from the city, and the legates reassembled at Nicaea in September 787. The Patriarch served as acting chairman (Christ was considered the true chairman). The council, known as the Second Council of Nicaea, condemned Iconoclasm and formally approved the veneration of icons. The patriarch assumed a moderate policy towards former Iconoclasts, which incurred the opposition of Theodore the Studite and his partisans.

== Divorce of Constantine VI ==
About a decade later, Tarasios became involved in a new controversy. In January 795, Emperor Constantine VI divorced his wife, Maria of Amnia, and Tarasios reluctantly condoned the divorce. The monks were scandalised by the patriarch&#x27;s consent. The leaders of the protest, Abbot Plato of Sakkoudion and his nephew Theodore the Studite, were exiled, but the uproar continued. Much of the anger was directed at Tarasios for allowing the subsequent marriage of the emperor to Theodote to take place, although he had refused to officiate. Under severe pressure from Theodore the Studite, Tarasios excommunicated the priest who had conducted Constantine&#x27;s second marriage.

== End of Patriarchate ==
Tarasios continued to loyally serve the subsequent imperial regimes of Irene and Nikephoros I. The patriarch&#x27;s reputation suffered from criticism of his alleged tolerance of simony. On the other hand, his pliability proved most welcome to three very different monarchs and accounts for Tarasios&#x27; continuation in office until his death. The later selections of the laymen Nikephoros I of Constantinople and Photios I of Constantinople as patriarchs may have been in part inspired by the example set by Tarasios.

== Sainthood ==
Though some later scholars have been critical of what they perceive as Tarasios&#x27; weakness before imperial power, he continues to be revered in the Eastern Orthodox Churches for his defence of the use of icons, and his struggle for the peace and unity of the Church. His feast day is celebrated on 25 February by the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches (This date on the Julian Calendar at present corresponds to 10 March in common years and 9 March in leap years on the Gregorian Calendar) and on 18 February by Latin Church Catholics.

<doc id="416081" wikidata="Q3328739" url="?curid=416081" title="Music of Palestine">
<text>The music of Palestine () is one of many regional subgenres of Arabic music. While it shares much in common with Arabic music, both structurally and instrumentally, there are musical forms and subject matter that are distinctively Palestinian.

==Pre-1948==
In the areas now controlled by both Israel and Palestine, multiple ethnic groups and religions have long held on to a diversity of cultures. Mandatory Palestine population with Arabs (including urban and rural Muslim classes, Arab Christians, Druze and Muslim Bedouin) constituted the largest group, followed by Jews (including Sephardim, Mizrahim and Ashkenazim), Samaritans, Circassians, Armenians, Dom and others. Wasif Jawhariyyeh was one oud player, famous for his post-1904 diary.

===Folk music===
Early in the 20th century, Palestinian Arabs lived in cities and in rural areas, either as farmers or as nomads. The fellahin (farmers) sang a variety of work songs, used for tasks like fishing, shepherding, harvesting and making olive oil. Traveling storytellers and musicians called &quot;zajaleen&quot; were also common, known for their epic tales. Weddings were also home to distinctive music, especially the dabke. Popular songs made use of widely varying forms, particularly the mejana and dal&#x27;ona.

==Post-1948==
===Folk music===
After the creation of Israel in 1948, large numbers of Arab Palestinians fled to, or were forced into, refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The most popular recorded musicians at the time were the superstars of Arab classical music, especially Umm Kulthum and Sayed Darwish. The centers for Palestinian music were in the Palestinian towns of Nazareth and Haifa, where performers composed in the classical styles of Cairo and Damascus. A shared Palestinian identity was reflected in a new wave of performers who emerged with distinctively Palestinian themes, relating to the dreams of statehood and the burgeoning nationalist sentiment.

In the 1970s, a new wave of popular Palestinian stars emerged, including Sabreen, Mustafa Al-Kurd and Al Ashiqeen. After the First Intifada (1987), a more hard-edged group of performers and songwriters emerged, such as al- Funoun, songwriter Suhail Khoury, songwriter Jameel al-Sayih, Thaer Barghouti&#x27;s &quot;Doleh&quot; and Sabreen&#x27;s &quot;Mawt a&#x27;nabi&quot;.

In the 1990s, the Palestinian National Authority was established, and Palestinian cultural expression began to stabilize. Wedding bands, which had all but disappeared during the fighting, reappeared to perform popular Egyptian and Lebanese songs. Other performers to emerge later in the 90s included Yuad, Washem, Mohsen Subhi, Adel Salameh, Issa Boulos, Wissam Joubran, Samir Joubran, and Basel Zayed with his new sound of Palestine and Turab group founded in 2004 with the CD &quot;Hada Liel&quot;.
The Diaspora Palestinian Reem Kelani is one of the foremost present day researchers and performers of music with a specifically Palestinian narrative and heritage. Her 2006 debut solo album &quot;Sprinting Gazelle – Palestinian Songs from the Motherland and the Diaspora&quot; comprised Kelani&#x27;s research and arrangement of five traditional Palestinian songs, whilst the other five songs were her own musical settings of popular and resistance poetry by the likes of Mahmoud Darwish, Salma Khadra Jayyusi, Rashid Husain and Mahmoud Salim al-Hout. All the songs on the album relate to pre-1948 Palestine.

A large part of Palestinian music comprises wedding songs and dances. Due to the large amount of weddings in Palestinian culture, wedding singers have been able to maintain the tradition of Palestinian songs whilst incorporating modern vocals and rhythms. Wedding singers draw from a repertoire of ceremonial material including henna songs sung at the henna ceremony, wedding processionals (zeffat), and popular debkah and dance songs.

===Classical music===
Before 1948, the Palestinians formed a part of the Arab cultural mosaic in the Levant, and it was difficult to separate them from the cultural and musical composition of the Syrian people. Although the popular music was limited to the genre of folk music that served the needs of ritual and social events varied, but the beginnings of a serious musical phenomenon began to form in Palestine with the presence of profound composers of the first generation, such as Augustin Lama, Yousef Khasho, Salvador Arnita and others. the second generation of composers included among others: Patrick Lama, Amin Nasser, Nasri Fernando Dueri, and Saleem Zoughbi. The third generation includes younger musicians such as Habib Touma, Mounir Anastas, Bichara El Khail and Sam Gebran, etc.. The Israeli occupation, the transfer of the identity of the Palestinian society from the sphere of integration and near-total identification with the Syrian identity within what was called Greater Syria to the formation of the Palestinian identity within the context of confrontation existential and cultural and political with the Zionists.
From this confrontation with the occupation emerged the movement of the poetry of the resistance, and with it emerged national Palestinian song against the occupation.
During the occupation, Palestinian classical music continued to rise, with new names in the realm of classical music along with the founding of many symphony orchestras (such as the Palestinian Youth Orchestra, and West-Eastern Divan, founded by Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said) as well as string quartets and quintets, which gave the Palestinian Territories the highest number of orchestras among Arab countries.

Names of Palestinian composers:
Salvador Arnita (1914–1985), Habib Hasan Touma (born in Nazareth, 1934, died in Berlin 1998), Nasri Fernando Dueri (born 1932), François Nicodeme (born in Jerusalem 1935) and his brother William Nicodeme, Amin Nasser in Ramleh 1935, Patrick Lama, Abdel-Hamid Hamam, Saleem Zoughbi.

=== War songs ===
Palestinian war songs prominently feature references to resistance against the occupation of Palestine, calling on Palestinians to fight the occupation and stay in their land, and describing historic events.

== Music and identity ==

Palestinian music reflects Palestinian experience. As might be expected, much of it deals with the struggle of living under Israeli occupation, the longing for peace, and the love of the land of Palestine. A typical example of such a song is &quot;Baladi, Baladi&quot; (My Country, My Country), which has become the unofficial Palestinian national anthem:
Palestine, Land of the fathers,
To you, I do not doubt, I will return.
Struggle, revolution, do not die,
For the storm is on the land.
&quot;Zareef et Tool&quot; is one of the most popular Palestinian songs of today and can be traced back decades. The song encourages Palestinians not to leave their homeland:

يا زريف الطول وقّف تاقلك ... رايح عالغربة و بلادك أحسنلك 
خايف يا زريف تروح و تتملك .. و تعاشر الغير و تنساني أنا 

O, elegant and tall one stop so I can tell you
You are going abroad and your country is better for you
I am afraid you will get established there
And find someone else and forget me

One of the biggest moments in Palestinian music is when Mohammad Assaf (born 1989) won the competition Arab Idol in 2013. With one of the biggest voter turn outs of all time he earned support from Palestinians and the Arab world. He would go on to make huge records such as &quot;Ana Dame falasteenee&quot; (my blood is Palestinian) a national and international treasure.

Mohammad Assaf would go on to be one of the highest selling Palestinian artists of all time.

==Forms of traditional Palestinian songs==

Unlike many other cultures, traditional Palestinian songs have no set lyrics but rather a set rhythm. The singers are usually family members or close friends who make up the lyrics on the spot. At modern Palestinian events there may be a professional singer, but the forms mentioned below, still very popular today, were created before the popularization of professional singers. Therefore, the song lyrics differ from city to city. Many types of Palestinian songs, including Atab/Mejana and Dal&#x27;ona, have transcended time. Due to the relevance of the subject matter and the need to maintain tradition and culture, traditional types of Palestinian songs can still be heard at events of today, such as weddings or gatherings. They still remain extremely popular throughout the Palestinian culture. Among the forms:

* Ataaba is the most popular type of song in Palestine. It is often sung by farmers, workers, and shepherds as a work song. However, weddings are the main environment for the songs. As with the other forms of songs, Mejana is based on poetry. Usually the singer starts with the long sound of &quot;Ooaaaff&quot;. Then the verses of ataba follow. Ataba is composed of four verses of poetry. The first three end with the same word in sound but different meanings. The fourth verse ends with a word that usually ends with a sound like &quot;Aab or Aywa!&quot;
* Dal&#x27;ona is the second most popular type of song in Palestine. It is easier to compose than ataba because it does not require the similar sound of the ends of the first three verses. However, like ataba, dal&#x27;na has four verses of poetry, where the first three have similar endings and the fourth usually ends with a sound like &quot;Oana&quot;. Dal&#x27;ona is the sound of the Palestinian popular dance, dabka, where the dancers sing it along with the sound of the shubbabah (flute), yarghool or mijwiz.
* The Sahja is another popular form of Palestinian song usually sung at weddings. It may be done by men or women and involves clapping to the rhythm of the song that is being sung to the bride by women, or groom by men. The men gather in two lines facing each other, or surround the groom. Then the zajal leads the sahja. The zajal is a talented singer or close family member who sings the sahja on the spot. The zajal leads the sahja with a verse, and the entire group repeats. The sahja done by women carries out the same process but with many women leading (usually older women) while the young women repeat. Also, the women may add a loud, &quot;Lolololeey&quot; during and at the end of the sahja. There is no female zajal.
* Zaghareet (pl), one of the oldest forms of Palestinian song, is another important form of song during Palestinian weddings. The zaghreet is traditionally sung by women at weddings or important events. One woman starts the zaghroot with a loud &quot;Heeey Hee...&quot; or &quot;Aweeha...&quot;. She then continues with a short poem or few rhyming words. After the women are done, they all join with a loud, &quot;Lolololoolololoeeeey&quot; sound. Unlike the women&#x27;s sahja, the zaghroot involves no clapping, and only one woman must take turns to offer a zaghareet.

==Palestinian hip hop==
Beginning in the late 1990s, Palestinian youth forged a new Palestinian musical subgenre – Palestinian rap or hip hop – which blends Arabic melodies and Western beats, with lyrics in Arabic, English and even Hebrew.

Borrowing from traditional rap music that first emerged in the ghettos of Los Angeles and New York in the 1970s, &quot;young Palestinian musicians have tailored the style to express their own grievances with the social and political climate in which they live and work.&quot;

DAM were pioneers in forging this blend. As Arab citizens of Israel, they rap in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, often challenging stereotypes about Palestinians and Arabs head-on in songs like &quot;Meen Erhabe?&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;s a terrorist?&quot;)

More peculiar is the West Bank group Ramallah Underground, found by the two brothers Boikutt and Stormtrap. Their sound is a mix of hip hop, trip hop, and downtempo alongside traditional Arab music. There are many rappers who defend Palestinian nationalism, an example being, Ortega (Alhasan) who caused a sensation in the Israeli media in 2012 because of his songs&#x27; hostility to Israel. Ortega (Alhasan) is considered a better performer of Palestinian rap in the Persian Gulf region, because he was born in the United Arab Emirates.

In the diaspora are the Abu-Ghaben brothers, who founded Jaffa Phonix in Cairo, Egypt. They blended big-beat, hip hop, and vocal punk elements.

==Opposition to music==
According to the human rights organization Freemuse, Palestinian musicians feared what was going to happen in the Palestinian territories where Islamic fundamentalists have become increasingly assertive since the militant Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005.

In 2005 an outdoor music and dance performance in Qalqiliya was suddenly banned by the Hamas led municipality, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by Islam. The municipality also ordered that music no longer be played in the Qalqiliya zoo, and mufti Akrameh Sabri issued a religious edict affirming the municipality&#x27;s decision. In response, the Palestinian national poet Mahmoud Darwish warned that &quot;There are Taliban-type elements in our society, and this is a very dangerous sign&quot;.

The Palestinian columnist Mohammed Abd Al-Hamid, a resident of Ramallah, warned that this religious coercion could cause the migration of artists, and said &quot;The religious fanatics in Algeria destroyed every cultural symbol, shattered statues and rare works of art and liquidated intellectuals and artists, reporters and authors, ballet dancers and singers – are we going to imitate the Algerian and Afghani examples?&quot;

==Courthouse==

William Buell granted the land for construction of the Brockville Courthouse atop a hill rising from the Saint Lawrence River. A broad boulevard extends to the main street. One of the oldest courthouses in Ontario, it was erected in 1842. The original plan had been to build one in Johnstown Township, but the land there was too swampy. Instead, it was built in Elizabethtown Township.

The figure of Themis, a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice, was made by master carver William Holmes in 1844. This statue was named &quot;Sally Grant&quot; by Paul Glasford, the chair of the building committee, in honour of the woman who posed as the model. It was erected in 1845, damaged by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 and rotting by 1956. The original is on display at a Westport museum. A replica carved by Robert Kerr of Smiths Falls was placed atop the courthouse in 1982.

<doc id="416090" wikidata="Q740758" url="?curid=416090" title="Hirokazu Kore-eda">
<text>is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, and editor. He began his career in television and has since directed more than a dozen feature films, including &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; (2004), &quot;Still Walking&quot; (2008), and &quot;After the Storm&quot; (2016). He won the Jury Prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;, and won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Shoplifters&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Kore-eda&#x27;s father was born in Taiwan before being conscripted into the Japanese military during World War II and detained in Siberia for three years after the end of the war. His paternal grandparents could not marry under Japanese law at the time as they had the same last name, so they eloped to Taiwan where they could, which was then under Japanese colonial rule. He has cited this as a reason for his affinity toward Taiwan.

Hirokazu Kore-eda was born on 6 June 1962 in Nerima, Tokyo, Japan. He is the youngest of three children, with two older sisters. From a young age, Kore-eda would spend time watching movies with his mother. He said through an interpreter, &quot;My mother loved films! She adored Ingrid Bergman, Joan Fontaine, Vivien Leigh. We couldn&#x27;t afford to go together to the cinema, but she was always watching their movies on TV. She stopped all family business or discussions to watch these movies. We would watch together. So I adored film – like her.&quot;

After seeing Japan win the gold medal in men&#x27;s volleyball at the 1972 Munich Olympics, he started playing in middle school. He rose to team captain in high school as a setter.

He initially failed his entrance exams, but was accepted into Waseda University a year later. He graduated from Waseda University&#x27;s Graduate School of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1987.

== Career ==
Before embarking on a career as a film director, Kore-eda worked as an assistant director on documentaries for television. He eventually transitioned into directing, and directed his first television documentary, &quot;Lessons from a Calf&quot;, in 1991. He directed several other documentary films thereafter.

One of his Documentaries, released in 1994, followed his friendship with AIDS sufferer Hirata Yutaka. The documentary, titled “August without him”, followed Kore-eda as he met with Yutaka and filmed his life between 1992 and 1994. During this period, he speaks openly on his condition, as well as being the first Japanese to admit he contracted the disease via homosexual contact. The film ends with Yutaka&#x27;s condition having deteriorated, and he died of AIDS Complications on May 29, 1994.

In 1995, at the Venice Film Festival, his first fiction feature film &quot;Maborosi&quot; won a Golden Osella Award for Best Cinematography. At the first Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema in 1999, he won awards for Best Film and Best Screenplay for his film &quot;After Life.&quot;

In 2005, he won the Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Film and Best Director for his film &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;. His 2008 film, &quot;Still Walking&quot;, also earned accolades, including Best Director at the 2009 Asian Film Awards, and the Golden Ástor for Best Film at the 2008 Mar del Plata International Film Festival.

His 2013 film, &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;, premiered and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. It eventually did not win, but it won the Jury Prize, as well as a commendation from the Ecumenical Jury. In October 2013, the film won the Rogers People&#x27;s Choice Award at the 2013 Vancouver International Film Festival.

Kore-eda&#x27;s 2015 film, &quot;Our Little Sister&quot;, was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, though it did not win. His 2016 film, &quot;After the Storm&quot;, debuted to critical acclaim at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard category. For his work on the film, he won the award for Best Director at the Yokohama Film Festival. Kore-eda won Best Film and Best Director Japan Academy Prizes for his film &quot;The Third Murder&quot; (2017), which also screened in the main competition of the 74th Venice International Film Festival.

In 2018, his film, titled &quot;Shoplifters&quot;, about a young girl who is welcomed in by a family of shoplifters, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d&#x27;Or. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

In 2018, he won the Donostia Award for his lifetime achievement at San Sebastián International Film Festival.

In 2019, Kore-eda directed &quot;The Truth&quot;, starring Catherine Deneuve, Juliette Binoche and Ethan Hawke. It is his first film shot in Europe and not in his native language.

In 2021, Kore-eda directed &quot;Broker&quot;. The film was shot in South Korea, featuring a predominantly South Korean cast and crew. It was first released on 8 June 2022. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2022 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.

In January 2022, it was announced that Kore-eda would be working with a team of directors including Megumi Tsuno, Hiroshi Okuyama, and Takuma Sato on a nine-episode series called &quot;The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House&quot;, adapted from the manga &quot;Kiyo in Kyoto&quot;.

In November 2022, Kore-eda disclosed that he had already completed shooting his next Japanese film, titled &quot;Monster&quot;. With post-production underway, &quot;Monster&quot; was scheduled for release in Japan on 2 June 2023. This release date positioned the film for a potential world premiere in May at the Cannes Film Festival, a customary platform for Kore-eda. The film won the Queer Palm and the Best Screenplay Award at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

in 2025, Kore-eda&#x27;s series &quot;Asura&quot; was released by Netflix. It is based on Kuniko Mukōda&#x27;s novel of the same name.

==Style and influences==
According to the Harvard Film Archive, Kore-eda&#x27;s works &quot;reflect the contemplative style and pacing of such luminaries as Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang&quot;.

Kore-eda is often compared to Yasujirō Ozu; however, he has stated he feels more influenced by British director Ken Loach and Japanese director Mikio Naruse.

In a 2009 interview, Kore-eda revealed that &quot;Still Walking&quot; is based on his own family.

== Personal life ==
Kore-eda was married in 2002 and has one daughter, born in 2007.

<doc id="416095" wikidata="Q7256276" url="?curid=416095" title="Psychic detective">
<text>A psychic detective is a person who purports to investigate crimes using paranormal psychic abilities. Claimed techniques and abilities have included postcognition (paranormal perception of the past), psychometry (information psychically gained from objects), telepathy, dowsing, clairvoyance, and remote viewing. In murder cases, psychic detectives may purport to be in communication with the spirits of the murder victims.

Individuals claiming psychic abilities have stated they have helped police departments to solve crimes, however, there is a lack of police corroboration of their claims. Many police departments around the world have released official statements saying that they do not regard psychics as credible or useful on cases.

== Prominent cases ==
Many prominent police cases, often involving missing persons, have received the attention of alleged psychics. In November 2004, purported psychic Sylvia Browne told the mother of kidnapping victim Amanda Berry, who had disappeared 19 months earlier: &quot;She&#x27;s not alive, honey.&quot; Browne also claimed to have had a vision of Berry&#x27;s jacket in the garbage with &quot;DNA on it&quot;. Berry&#x27;s mother died two years later believing that her daughter had been killed; Berry was found alive in May 2013 having been a kidnapping victim of Ariel Castro along with Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus. After Berry was found alive, Browne received criticism for the false declaration that Berry was dead. Browne also became involved in the case of Shawn Hornbeck, which received the attention of psychics after the eleven-year-old went missing on 6 October 2002. Browne appeared on &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; and provided the parents of Shawn Hornbeck a detailed description of the abductor and where Hornbeck could be found. Browne responded &quot;No&quot; when asked if he was still alive. When Hornbeck was found alive more than four years later, few of the details given by Browne were correct. Shawn Hornbeck&#x27;s father, Craig Akers, has stated that Browne&#x27;s declaration was &quot;one of the hardest things that we&#x27;ve ever had to hear&quot;, and that her misinformation diverted investigators wasting precious police time.

When Washington, D.C. intern Chandra Levy went missing on 1 May 2001, psychics from around the world provided tips suggesting that her body would be found in places such as the basement of a Smithsonian storage building, in the Potomac River, and buried in the Nevada desert among many other possible locations. Each tip led nowhere. A little more than a year after her disappearance, Levy&#x27;s body was accidentally discovered by a man walking his dog in a remote section of Rock Creek Park.

Following the disappearance of Elizabeth Smart on 5 June 2002, the police received as many as 9,000 tips from psychics (and others crediting visions and dreams as their source). Responding to these tips took &quot;many police hours&quot;, according to Salt Lake City Police Chief Lieutenant Chris Burbank. Yet, Elizabeth Smart&#x27;s father, Ed Smart, concluded that: &quot;the family didn&#x27;t get any valuable information from psychics&quot;. Smart was located by observant witnesses who recognized her abductor from a police photograph. No psychic was ever credited with finding Elizabeth Smart.

In the case of the Long Island serial killer, the psychic said the body would be found in a shallow grave, near water and a sign with a G in it would be nearby. Despite the vagueness of this claim (the body was not in a shallow grave, water is everywhere in Long Island, and no sign with a G was nearby) the &quot;New York Post&quot; stated that the &quot;Psychic Nailed it!&quot;. Describing the case, skeptic and author Benjamin Radford wrote: &quot;more surprising than the psychic&#x27;s failure is the fact that this information was described as an amazing success on over 70,000 websites without anyone realizing that she was completely wrong&quot;.

A body was located in the US by psychic Annette Martin. Dennis Prado, a retired US paratrooper, had gone missing from his apartment and police had been unable to locate his whereabouts. With no further leads, the chief investigating officer, Fernando Realyvasquez, a sergeant with the Pacifica (California) Police, contacted psychic detective Annette Martin. Prado had lived near a large forest, some 2000 square miles. Martin was given a map, she circled a small spot on the map, about the size of two city blocks. She said that Prado had struggled for breath, had died, and his body would be there within the indicated area. She described the path he took, and where the body would be found. Although the area had been searched before and Prado had not been found, a search and rescue officer initiated a new search with the help of a search dog, as Martin suggested &quot;A search dog is going to find him.&quot; They found the body covered with dirt at the location, as Martin had indicated. While the body had deteriorated, there was no evidence that he had been attacked and it is thought that he had likely died of natural causes, as she also indicated. However, when Joe Nickell, a columnist for Skeptical Inquirer magazine, was shown tapes of Martin at work, he stated he was &quot;underwhelmed&quot;. Regarding the Prado case, he noted that &quot;What she did was very shrewdly ask all kinds of questions of that police officer, who helped her even further and told her all kinds of things. It&#x27;s probably perfectly sincere, not an act. But it&#x27;s just the facility of a highly imaginative and emotional person and doesn&#x27;t mean anything scientifically&quot;.

In August 2010, Aboriginal elder Cheryl Carroll-Lagerwey claimed to have seen the location of a missing child, Kiesha Abrahams, in her dream. The missing child&#x27;s disappearance was being investigated by police. She took them to a location where a dead body was found, however it was of an adult woman and not the body of the child.

In Sydney, Australia, in 1996, a Belgian-born Sydney psychic, Phillipe Durant was approached by the fiancé of missing Paula Brown to help locate her. Durante told police the location of the body of Brown. She was found less than two kilometres from the spot he had indicated in Port Botany, New South Wales, by a lorry driver who came across the body. &quot;Even though the body was discovered purely by chance, the speculation by a clairvoyant appears to have been uncannily accurate&quot;, a police spokeswoman conceded. Durant had used a plumb bob and a grid map, combined with some hair from the victim.

In 2001, the body of Thomas Braun was located by Perth-based Aboriginal clairvoyant Leanna Adams in Western Australia. Police had initially been unable to find the body. The family of Braun had been told to contact Adams, an Aboriginal psychic who lived in Perth. The Braun family had requested police to do a search based on Adams&#x27;s directions but they had not assisted. Adams went to Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, which was 3600 kilometres away from her home in Perth. She took the family members directly to Braun&#x27;s remains, a spot high on a ridge west of the town, some 20 kilometres out. The remains were not immediately identifiable. Police later confirmed the remains to be his using DNA testing.

Noreen Renier claimed to have solved the murder of Kimberly McAndrew, who disappeared on August 12, 1989. Six years after McAndrew went missing, in October 1995 the Halifax Regional Police hired Renier to help. Renier gave the police three interviews which were recorded and years later obtained for review by Tampa Bay Skeptics founder Gary P. Posner. Using psychometry, Renier claimed to channel the murder victim. After a long analysis of the tapes, Posner states that Renier took the detectives on a &quot;wild goose chase&quot;. Renier&#x27;s clues were misleading, vague or incoherent, leading to nothing solid that could be verified. Renier assured the police that the body would be found soon, before Christmas of that year (1995), saying it would be &quot;a nice Christmas present for everybody&quot;. But decades later it has yet to be located, and the Government of the Province of Nova Scotia is still offering rewards of up to $150,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person(s) responsible for Kimberly&#x27;s disappearance.

In 2023, Charlotte Sena was reported missing from a campground in Moreau Lake State Park in Saratoga County, New York resulting in a huge search effort involving over 400 people, including teams from the New York State Police, New York State Park Police, Forest Rangers, the FBI, and other agencies. Suspecting a possible abduction case, the State Police put the family&#x27;s home under surveillance, and after a suspicious vehicle drew attention of the police, a ransom note was found in the family&#x27;s mailbox. Forensic evidence was soon matched to Ballston Spa resident Craig Nelson Ross Jr. (born March 17, 1977), who had a previous criminal history and was living about eighteen miles away from the campground where Sena was found safe and Ross was arrested. A segment from WNYT NewsChannel 13 called &quot;Psychic helps police, family of a kidnapped girl&quot; featured Christine Seebold-Walrath, a self-styled psychic medium. In the segment, journalist Dan Levy claimed that Seebold-Walrath was in touch with the New York State Police and the victim&#x27;s family during the ordeal, implying she helped with the investigation. However, skeptic Kenny Biddle, chief investigator at the Center For Inquiry, contacted the Saratoga office of the New York State Police and spoke to Officer Stephanie O&#x27;Neil who explained whenever information pertaining to a kidnapping, missing person, or homicide is released, they always receive many calls from alleged psychics and that police must follow up on every tip. When asked directly by Biddle, O&#x27;Neil said that Seebold-Walrath did not provide any information that helped with the case. Ross was later sentenced to 47 years in prison the following year, and was currently confining his sentence at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica.

==Official police responses==
Many police departments around the world have released official statements saying that they do not regard psychics as credible or useful on cases.

===In Australia===
Australian police, officially, in general have said that they do not accept assistance from psychics. This was in response to an Australian TV show &quot;Sensing Murder&quot; in which psychics attempt to crack unsolved murders.
Western Australian Police have a policy that they do not contact psychics for assistance with investigations, however they will accept information contributed by psychics.
An unnamed Australian federal police officer was suspended following his seeking the aid of a clairvoyant in regard to death threats made against Prime Minister John Howard. A federal police spokesman said they do &quot;not condone the use of psychics in security matters&quot;.
There are still cases of psychics professing to have trained with the Australian police and failing to provide credible evidence to support qualifications or evidence of being a psychic profiler or intuitive profiler with the Australian police.

While official policy for police forces in Australia does not advocate the use of psychics for investigations, one former Detective Senior Constable, Jeffrey Little, has said police do use them &quot;even though they officially say they don&#x27;t&quot;. Additionally, police in NSW have used psychic Debbie Malone on a number of cases. While no evidence she has supplied has solved murders or missing investigations on their own, her evidence had been used to corroborate theories, and in one case, included in a coroner&#x27;s brief on a case. Little, in reference to one case she assisted on, felt her description of what happened was &quot;exceptional&quot;, other officers also had been impressed by her assistance, while yet other NSW officers felt she had not helped solve any cases. Sergeant Gae Crea and Detective Sergeant Damian Loone, state that she did not give them anything the police and the public didn&#x27;t already know. Crea recounts &quot;I&#x27;ve dealt with a lot of psychics, but no one has ever said, &#x27;I can see where the body is buried and I&#x27;ll take you there.

=== In New Zealand ===
New Zealand police have said &quot;spiritual communications were not considered a creditable foundation for investigation&quot;.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
In 2006, 28 British police forces responded to a query from the Association for Rational Inquiry to say that they did not and have never used psychics, one force saying &quot;We are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium.&quot; In 2009, when the Metropolitan Police had denied the use of psychics and were then presented with emails suggesting the use of a psychic they made a press statement authorized by the senior investigating officer that was much more ambiguous: &quot;We do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with inquiries. We are not prepared to discuss this further.&quot;

=== In the United States ===
A 1993 survey of police departments in the 50 largest cities in the United States revealed that a third of them had accepted predictions from psychic detectives in the past, although only 7 departments treated such information any differently from information from ordinary sources. No police department reported any instances of a psychic investigator providing information that was more helpful than other information received during the course of a case; since any information has to be proved, only information matching other evidence could be used. A follow-up study looking at small and medium-sized cities in the United States, found that psychics were called upon by the police departments of those cities even less frequently than large cities. A former senior investigator for the FBI has stated that psychics may be used &quot;as a last resort [and] as an investigative tool with caution&quot; for providing clues not directly admissible in the court of law such as a criminal&#x27;s character, or the location of dead bodies.

==Scientific studies==
A number of tests have been conducted on psychics detectives, using control groups, to try to establish any psychic ability relating to crime solving. One of the earliest was carried out by Dutch Police officer, Filippus Brink in 1960. He conducted a year-long study of psychics, but found no evidence of any crime-solving abilities. Another study was conducted in 1982 where evidence from four crimes was given to three groups: psychic detectives, students and police detectives. The clues related to four crimes, two crimes that had been solved, and two that had not been. The study found no difference between the three groups in ability to indicate what crimes had been committed by looking at the evidence. Some flaws in the scientific method were apparent in these two tests. A further test was conducted in 1997, this test focusing on improving on the scientific methods used in the previous tests. This study used two groups, one consisting of three students from the University of Hertfordshire, the other group consisting of three psychics (two psychic detectives and a non-detective psychic who had a media profile and had been endorsed by police due to his abilities). The two groups were shown three objects associated with three serious crimes. They then advocated theories, but once again, no difference was found in terms of the accuracy between the two groups.

To assess the claims of psychic crime-solving, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) established a task force of investigators. The group recorded many failures by psychics to provide useful information to criminal investigators, and felt that psychics may use &quot;retrofitting&quot; (or after-the-fact matching), offering vague clues, and then trying to retroactively fit them to details that are only discovered later. In addition to cases of retrofitting, the apparent use of cold reading (a psychic&#x27;s fishing for information while appearing to gain it paranormally), exaggeration, and examples where the psychic has used non-psychic sources of information, were also reviewed.

In 2008, while being interviewed for the &quot;Skeptiko&quot; podcast, managing editor of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, Ben Radford challenged the host, Alex Tsakiris, to give him the best case for evidence of a psychic solving a crime. As Tsakiris had &quot;repeatedly accused skeptical investigators of purposely choosing the weakest cases&quot;, Radford agreed to investigate in depth a case from any period in history, around the world, &quot;that presented the gold standard for evidence&quot;. Tsakiris chose psychic Nancy Weber who, in 2006, appeared on an episode of the Biography Channel &quot;Psychic Investigators&quot;. Weber claimed to have helped the New Jersey police solve the 1982 serial murders of Amie Hoffman and Dierdre O&#x27;Brien. The police arrested James Koedatich in 1983 who was later found guilty of serial murder. &quot;Psychic Investigators&quot; interviewed Weber as well as the two police detectives she worked with, Hughes and Moore, who verified Weber had given them information &quot;she could not have known&quot;. Radford spent the next nine months reviewing the case, and he and Tsakiris re-interviewed the detectives as well as the psychic on the &quot;Skeptiko&quot; podcast. Radford discovered that the detectives had not kept their notes from the case, and that their story had changed since the TV show aired. In fact, he found that their stories now contradicted the psychic&#x27;s story on several points. A further discovery by Radford using a New Jersey phone book from 1982 found that if the psychic had indeed given the detectives all the evidence she claimed she had, the police could have discovered the killer with a 20-minute search through the phone book. Radford believes that the police and the psychic &quot;simply fell prey to confirmation bias&quot;, however, Tsakiris believes Radford&#x27;s conclusions and publicized information was a &quot;gross misrepresentation&quot;.

==Critical commentary==
In 2023, the podcast, Worldwide: The Disappearance of the Thai Silk King, released an episode featuring a professional skeptic discussing the dangers of psychic detectives getting involved in missing person cases. The episode examines Peter Hurkos and Sylvia Brown, in particular, and categorizes and demystifies psychics and their manipulation tools.

ABC&#x27;s Nightline &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; program for 17 August 2011 featured psychic detectives and their involvement with the case of Ali Lowitzer. Typical of missing person cases, families are approached by people claiming they will help bring the missing home. &quot;They told me, I see trees, water, dirt... but it is all very vague&quot; according to Susan Lowitzer a mother whose daughter has been missing since 26 April 2010. Retired FBI agent and ABC consultant Brad Garrett states, &quot;In 30 years...I have never seen a psychic solve a mystery&quot;, while Bob Nygaard, a retired 20-year veteran of the Nassau County police department and currently a private investigator specializing in the investigation of psychics, noted that he had not worked with, nor did he know of anyone on the force who had worked with, any psychic detectives.

JREF investigator and mentalist Banachek feels that psychic detectives take advantage of families, &quot;... because of fame and money, [they] step in and try to act like an authority&quot;. Banachek believes that not all psychic detectives are frauds, some are self-deluded and believe they are helping, but they &quot;send police on wild-goose chases wasting precious time and resources&quot;. Psychic Georgia O&#x27;Conner states that Ali is dead, she was tortured and her body dismembered. When asked by ABC&#x27;s JuJu Chang how can she tell parents this kind of information when she might be wrong, O&#x27;Conner replies &quot;I can&#x27;t let my ego get in the way of what I see&quot;. Despite the attention from psychic detectives Ali Lowitzer remains missing from her Spring, Texas home.

No psychic detective has ever been praised or given official recognition by the FBI or US national news for solving a crime, preventing a crime, or finding a kidnap victim or corpse.

The Australian Institute of Criminology, Australia&#x27;s official crime research agency, advises parents of missing children not to resort to using psychics who approach them. Former FBI analyst and profiler Clint Van Zandt has criticized the use of psychic detectives and has stated that &quot;What happens many times is that professed psychics allow themselves the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. After the case is solved, they make their previously vague predictions somehow fit the crime and the criminal.&quot; A detailed 2010 study of Sylvia Browne predictions about 115 missing persons and murder cases has found that despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, &quot;Browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case.&quot;

==Belief in psychic detectives==
Psychologists, researchers and other authors have posited a number of possible explanations for the belief that some can provide valuable crime information from psychic abilities. The possible explanations include confirmation bias (or our natural tendency to favor information to confirm our beliefs), wishful thinking (which is the act of making decisions based upon what is appealing rather than reasoned), and &quot;retrofitting&quot; (or retroactively refining the specifics of a prediction after the facts are revealed). The act of reinterpreting vague and nebulous statements made by psychic detectives is also referred to as the &quot;multiple out&quot;. Taking advantage of these cognitive limitations is the practice of cold reading which creates the illusion of knowing specific information. Additionally, police detectives and other authors suggest that psychic detectives appear successful due to making common-sense or high-probability predictions such as finding bodies at dump sites or &quot;near water&quot;.

While police departments claim they do not seek out or use psychics to solve crimes, they must follow up on all credible tips. If police do not refute this theory then &quot;many in the public continue to believe that psychics are secretly employed by law enforcement&quot;. If the police state they do not use psychics then psychics claim that the police do not want to &quot;share the credit&quot; and are just covering up.

Finally, the use of psychics may simply reduce anxiety and fill the emotional needs of individuals who must be experiencing great stress.

==In fiction==

There is a long history of psychic detectives in horror and crime fiction, and in other genres as well. One of the earliest forms of the genre was the character Flaxman Low, created in 1897 by mother and son Kate and Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard under the pseudonyms H. Heron and E. Heron. The Prichards wrote their stories at the behest of the press baron Cyril Pearson for his monthly &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, though they were disconcerted to find the tales promoted by Pearson as &quot;real&quot;. The collected work was published as &quot;The Experiences of Flaxman Low&quot; in 1899.

Other literary examples include Jules de Grandin (created by Seabury Quinn), Doctor Occult (created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster) and Agent Jasi McLellan created by Cheryl Kaye Tardif.

The popular TV show, &quot;Psych&quot; features Shawn Spencer (James Roday Rodriguez), a charlatan paranormal detective helping the Santa Barbara police with crimes that range from robberies to kidnappings to murders. However, the man actually uses an acute sense of observation that he acquired as a child; an eidetic memory; excellent vision; and deduction and reasoning to solve cases, making a running gag of his claim to be a psychic.

In Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; novels, the titular character—a &quot;holistic&quot; detective—is implied to have psychic powers on occasion. One incident involved Gently attempting to scam his university classmates into paying for a set of answers to an exam, supposedly obtained using psychic powers that Gently did not think he had. To his surprise, the answers he provided, which he thought he had produced randomly, turned out to be entirely correct. He was expelled as a result.

Peter F. Hamilton wrote a series of books about the ex-military psychic Greg Mandel. In the series, Greg was a retired special forces soldier created as part of an elite spec-ops unit, the Mindstar Brigade, in the &#x27;English Army&#x27;, having fought a vicious war in Turkey and helped a rebellion overthrow the People&#x27;s Socialist Party at home. Having won the rebellion he then retired to Rutland, suddenly being called out of retirement by the rich heiress Julia Evans to use his psychic talents to find the root of industrial espionage against her company, Event Horizon [an organisation that was also integral to the overthrow of the communist government]. The series not only focuses on Greg&#x27;s abilities, but also the abilities of other psychics created as part of the Mindstar Programme, the effects of social and economic change throughout the 21st century, global warming and rapid scientific advances. Greg regularly uses his abilities both for interrogation and as an offensive weapon.

The episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; depicts a psychic joining the hunt to find Principal Skinner.

The episode &quot;Cartman&#x27;s Incredible Gift&quot; of &quot;South Park&quot; depicts a skeptical view of psychic detectives.

The manga and anime series &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; depicts a teenage boy working as a Spirit Detective: a human who hunts down demons using psychic abilities.

<text>Alison Margaret Smithson (22 June 1928 – 14 August 1993) and Peter Denham Smithson (18 September 1923 – 3 March 2003) were English architects who together formed an architectural partnership, and are often associated with the New Brutalism, especially in architectural and urban theory.

== Education and personal lives ==
Peter was born in Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham, north-east England, and Alison Margaret Gill was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire.

Alison studied architecture at King&#x27;s College, Durham in Newcastle (later the Newcastle University School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape), then part of the University of Durham, between 1944 and 1949. Peter studied architecture at the same university between 1939 and 1948, along with a programme in the Department of Town Planning, also at King&#x27;s, between 1946 and 1948. His studies were interrupted by war, and from 1942 he served in the Madras Sappers and Miners in India and Burma.

Peter and Alison had met at Durham, and they married in 1949. In the same year they both joined the architecture department of the London County Council as Temporary Technical Assistants before establishing their own partnership in 1950.

Of their three children, Simon, Samantha and Soraya, one, Simon, is an architect.

Alison Smithson published a novel &quot;A Portrait of the Female Mind as a Young Girl&quot; in 1966.

==Work==

The Smithsons first came to prominence with Hunstanton School, Norfolk completed in 1954, which used some of the language of high modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe but in a stripped back way, with rough finishes and a deliberate lack of refinement that kept architectural structure and services exposed. They are arguably among the leaders of the British school of New Brutalism. They referred to New Brutalism as &quot;an ethic, not an aesthetic&quot;. It was a &quot;brute&quot; injunction to social relevance, &quot;an attempt to be objective about &#x27;reality&#x27;&quot;, its aim to &quot;drag a rough poetry out of the confused and powerful forces which are at work&quot;. Their work sought to connect architecture with what they viewed as the realities of modern life in post-war Britain. Their definitions and interpretation of Brutalism put them at odds with their contemporary Reyner Banham, an architecture critic known for his work in defining the stylistic components of New Brutalism.

Alison Smithson articulated their desire to connect building, users, and site when, describing architecture as an act of &quot;form-giving&quot;, she noted: &quot;My act of form-giving has to invite the occupiers to add their intangible quality of use.&quot; As such, they turned against the formal unity of classical proportion and symmetry, governed by principles of geometry, to instead fashion architecture on the topological principle of &quot;form in process&quot; or &quot;deforming form,&quot; governed by qualities of circulation, penetration, and thresholds, as most especially evident in their Robin Hood Gardens scheme. After the critical success of Hunstanton School, they were associated with Team X and its 1953 revolt against old Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM) philosophies of high modernism.

Among their early contributions were &#x27;streets in the sky&#x27; in which traffic and pedestrian circulation were rigorously separated, a theme popular in the 1960s, yet first coined by the Smithsons in 1952 with their Golden Lane Estate competition entry. This exemplified the use of the human figure in relation to scale, to better understand the visual representation of an unbuilt architecture.

They were members of the Independent Group participating in the 1953 &quot;Parallel of Life and Art&quot; exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; in 1956. Throughout their career they published their work energetically, including their several unbuilt schemes, giving them a profile, at least among other architects, out of proportion to their relatively modest output.

Peter Smithson&#x27;s teaching activity included the participation for many years at the ILAUD workshops, together with fellow architect Giancarlo De Carlo.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/24) with Peter Smithson in 1997 for its Architects Lives&#x27; collection held by the British Library.

==Built projects==

Their built projects include:
*Smithdon High School, Hunstanton, Norfolk (1949–54; a Grade II* listed building)
* The House of the Future exhibition at the 1956 Ideal Home Show
* Family house for acoustician and engineer Derek Sugden, Watford (1956)
* Upper Lawn Pavilion, Fonthill Estate, Tisbury, Wiltshire (1959–62)
* Office tower for &quot;The Economist&quot;, members accommodation for Boodles, bank and art gallery, St James&#x27;s Street, London – often known as the Economist Plaza (1959–65)
*Garden building, St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford (1968)
*Private house extension for Lord Kennet, Bayswater, London, 1960
*Robin Hood Gardens housing complex, Poplar, East London (1969–72)
*Buildings at the University of Bath, including the School of Architecture and Building Engineering (1988)
*Their last project: the Cantilever-Chair Museum of the Bauhaus design company TECTA in Lauenfoerde, Germany

Robin Hood Gardens was under construction when B. S. Johnson made a short film about the couple for the BBC, &quot;The Smithsons on Housing&quot; (1970). Sukhdev Sandhu, in a blog entry for the London &quot;Telegraph&quot; website, wrote that &quot;they drone in self-pitying fashion about vandals and local naysayers to such an extent that any traces of visionary utopianism are extinguished.&quot; The finished flats suffered from high costs associated with the system selected and from high levels of crime, all of which undermined the modernist vision of &#x27;streets in the sky&#x27; and the Smithsons&#x27; architectural reputation. In 2017, with the flats set to be demolished, a three-storey section including a walkway and maisonette interiors was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum.

They would go on to design several buildings at Bath, while relying mainly on private overseas commissions and Peter Smithson&#x27;s writing and teaching (he was a visiting professor at Bath from 1978 to 1990, and also a unit master at the Architectural Association School of Architecture).

==Unbuilt proposals==
Their unbuilt schemes include:
*Coventry Cathedral unsuccessful competition entry, 1951
*Golden Lane Estate unsuccessful competition entry, 1952
*Sheffield University, unsuccessful competition entry
*Hauptstadt, unsuccessful competition entry, 1957
*British Embassy, Brasília, competition-winning design, unbuilt due to financial constraints, 1961

<text>The Helsinki Metro (, ) is a rapid transit system serving the Helsinki capital region, Finland. It is the world&#x27;s northernmost metro system. It was opened to the general public on 2 August 1982 after 27 years of planning. It is operated by Helsinki City Transport and Metropolitan Area Transport Ltd for Helsinki Regional Transport Authority and carries 92.6 million passengers per year.

The system consists of 2 lines, serving a total of 30 stations. It has a total length of . It is the predominant rail link between the suburbs of East Helsinki and the western suburbs in the city of Espoo and downtown Helsinki.

The line passes under Helsinki Central Station, allowing passengers to transfer to and from the Helsinki commuter rail network, including trains on the Ring Rail Line to Helsinki Airport.

== History ==

=== 1955–67: Light rail plan ===

The initial motion for building a metropolitan railway system in Helsinki was made in September 1955, though during the five decades beforehand, the idea of a tunneled urban railway for Helsinki had surfaced several times. A suburban traffic committee (&quot;&quot;) was formed under the leadership of (1908–1981), and in late 1955, the committee set to work on the issue of whether or not there was truly a need for a tunneled public transport system in Helsinki. After nearly four years of work, the committee presented its findings to the city council. The findings of the committee were clear: Helsinki needed a metro system built on separate right-of-way. This was the first time the term &quot;metro&quot; was used to describe the planned system. At the time the committee did not yet elaborate on what kind of vehicles should be used on the metro: trams, heavier rail vehicles, buses or trolleybuses were all alternatives. The city council&#x27;s reaction to the committee&#x27;s presentation was largely apathetic, with several council members stating to the press that they did not understand anything about Castrén&#x27;s presentation.

Despite the lacklustre reception, Castrén&#x27;s committee was asked to continue its work, now as the metro committee, although very little funding was provided. In spring 1963 the committee presented its proposal for the Helsinki Metro system. On a technical level this proposal was very different from the system that was finally realised. In the 1963 proposal the metro was planned as a light rail system, running in tunnels a maximum of below the surface (compared to in the finalized system), and with stations placed at shorter intervals (for instance, the committee&#x27;s presentation shows ten stations between Sörnäinen and Ruoholahti, compared to the six in the realized system). The Castrén Committee proposed for the system to be built in five phases, with the first complete by 1969 and the final by 2000, by which time the system would have a total length of with 108 stations. This was rejected after lengthy discussions as too extensive. In 1964 the city commissioned experts from Hamburg, Stockholm and Copenhagen to evaluate the metro proposal. Their opinions were unanimous: a metro was needed and the first sections should be built by 1970.

Although no official decision to build a system along the lines proposed by Castrén was ever made, several provisions for a light rail metro system were made during the 1950s–1960s, including separate lanes on the Kulosaari and Naurissaari bridges, and space for a metro station in the 1964 extension of Munkkivuori shopping center. The RM 1, HM V and RM 3 trams built for the Helsinki tram system in the late 1950s were also equipped to be usable on the possible light rail metro lines.

=== 1967–69: Heavy rail plan ===
In late 1967, Reino Castrén departed Helsinki for Calcutta, where he had been invited as an expert in public transport. Prior to his departure Castrén indicated he planned to return to Helsinki in six months and continue his work as leader of the metro committee. For the duration of Castrén&#x27;s absence, (1929–1989) was appointed as the leader of the committee. However, by the time Castrén returned, Valtanen&#x27;s position had been made permanent. Following his appointment Valtanen informed the other members of the committee that the plans made under Castrén&#x27;s leadership were outdated, and now the metro would be planned as a heavy rail system in deep tunnels mined into bedrock. Following two more years of planning, the Valtanen-led committee&#x27;s proposal for an initial metro line from Kamppi to Puotila in the east of the city was approved after hours of debate in the city council on the early morning hours of 8 May 1969. The initial section was to be opened for service in 1977.

=== 1969–82: Construction ===

Construction of a testing track from the depot in Roihupelto to Herttoniemi was begun in 1969 and finished in 1971. The first prototype train, units M1 and M2, arrived from the Valmet factory in Tampere on 10 November 1971, with further four units (M3–M6) arriving the following year. Car M1 burned in the metro depot in 1973.

Excavating the metro tunnels under central Helsinki had begun in June 1971. Most of the tunneling work had been completed by 1976, excluding the Kluuvi bruise (), a wedge of clay and pieces of rock in the bedrock, discovered during the excavation process. To build a tunnel through the bruise an unusual solution was developed: the bruise was turned into a giant freezer, with pipes filled with Freon 22 pushed through the clay. The frozen clay was then carefully blasted away, with cast iron tubes installed to create a durable tunnel. Construction of the first stations, Kulosaari and Hakaniemi begun in 1974. The Kulosaari station was the first to be completed, in 1976, but construction of the other stations took longer. As the case with many underground structures in Helsinki, the underground metro stations were designed to also serve as bomb shelters.

In summer 1976, Teuvo Aura, the mayor of Helsinki, signed an agreement with Valmet and Strömberg to purchase the trains required for the metro from them. In doing so Aura bypassed the city council completely, reportedly because he feared the council would decide to buy the rolling stock from manufacturers in the Soviet Union instead. By this time the direct current–based technology of the M1 series trains had become outdated. In 1977 prototypes for the M100 train series (referred to as &quot;nokkajuna&quot;, , to differentiate from the M1 prototypes) were delivered. In these units the direct current from the power rail was converted to alternating current powering induction motors. The M100 trains were the first metro trains in the world to be equipped with such technology.

Aura&#x27;s bypassing the city council in acquiring the rolling stock was not the only questionable part of the construction process of the Metro. On 3 June 1982, two days after the Metro had been opened for provisional traffic, Unto Valtanen came under investigation for taking bribes. Subsequently, several members of the metro committee and Helsinki municipal executive committee in addition to Valtanen were charged with taking bribes. In the end it was found that charges against all the accused except Valtanen had expired. Valtanen was convicted for having taken bribes from Siemens.

=== 1982 onwards: In service ===

On 1 June 1982, the test drives were opened to the general public. Trains ran with passengers during the morning and afternoon rush hours between Itäkeskus and Hakaniemi (the Sörnäinen station was not yet opened at this time). On 1 July the provisional service was extended to Rautatientori. President of the Republic of Finland Mauno Koivisto officially opened the Metro for traffic on 2 August 1982 – 27 years after the initial motion to the city assembly had been made.

The Metro did not immediately win the approval from inhabitants of eastern Helsinki, whose direct bus links to the city centre had now been turned into feeder lines for the Metro. Within six months of the Metro&#x27;s official opening, a petition signed by 11,000 people demanded the restoration of direct bus links. Subsequently, the timetables of the feeder services were adjusted and opposition to the Metro mostly died down.

On 1 March 1983, the Metro was extended in the west to Kamppi. The Sörnäinen station, between Hakaniemi and Kulosaari, was opened on 1 September 1984.

The Metro was extended eastwards in the late 1980s, with the Kontula and Myllypuro stations opened in 1986, and the Mellunmäki station following in 1989. The construction of a westwards expansion begun in 1987 with tunneling works from Kamppi towards Ruoholahti. The Ruoholahti metro station was opened on 16 August 1993.

Another new station followed: the Kaisaniemi station, between Rautatientori and Hakaniemi, was opened on 1 March 1995. Its construction had, in fact, been decided on in 1971, and the station cavern had been carved out of the rock during the original tunneling works, but a lack of funds had pushed back the station&#x27;s completion.

On 31 August 1998, after four years of construction, the final section of the original plan was completed, with the opening of a three-station fork from Itäkeskus to Vuosaari.

The second generation of Metro trains to be used in passenger service (the M200s) were delivered in 2000 and 2001 by Bombardier. These trains are based on Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s Class 481 EMUs used on the Berlin S-Bahn network.

On 25 September 2006, the city council of Espoo approved, after decades of debate, planning, and controversy, the construction of a western extension of the Metro. Metro trains began to run to Matinkylä in late 2017. (See section The future below.)

On 1 January 2007, Kalasatama station, between the Sörnäinen and Kulosaari stations, was opened. It serves the new &quot;Sörnäistenranta-Hermanninranta&quot; (Eastern Harbour) area, a former port facility redeveloped as its functions were relocated to the new Port of Vuosaari in the east of the city.

On 8 November 2009, the Rautatientori station, under the Central Railway Station, was closed due to flooding caused by a burst water main. After renovations, the station reopened for public use on 15 February 2010. The lifts were fully replaced; the new ones opened on 21 June 2010. On 23 August 2019, heavy rain caused the Rautatientori station to close once again due to flooding. The station reopened in a matter of days, but the lifts again took many months to fix, finally reopening on 17 March 2020.

=== 2006 onwards: The western extension ===

The construction of the Western extension from Ruoholahti to Matinkylä in Espoo was approved by the Espoo city council in 2006. Construction began in 2009 and the extension was opened on 18 November 2017. This first stage of the extension was long, with eight new stations, two in Helsinki and six in Espoo and was built entirely in a tunnel excavated in bedrock.

After first stage of the Western extension opened, the bus lines in Southern Espoo were reconfigured as feeder lines to either Matinkylä or Tapiola metro stations instead of terminating at Kamppi in the centre of Helsinki. After much outcry, four new peak-time lines began running into Kamppi on 22 August 2018.

Before the extension of the metro, trains could be a maximum length of three units (each unit being two cars) but the new stations west of Ruoholahti were built shorter than the existing stations because it was originally planned to introduce driverless operation. The driverless project was cancelled in 2015, but the shorter new stations mean that the maximum train length is reduced to two units, shorter than on the original sections of the metro. To increase capacity, the automatic train protection system theoretically permits headway as short as 90 seconds, if required in the future.

The decision to fund the construction of the second stage, from Matinkylä to Kivenlahti, was taken by the Espoo city council and the state of Finland in 2014. Construction began in late 2014. This stage of extension is long and includes five new stations and a new depot in Sammalvuori. All of the track, including the depot, was built in tunnels. The line opened for passenger traffic on the 3rd of December 2022. As with the first phase to Matinkylä, the feeder lines that used ro run to Matinkylä bus terminal were changed to run to Espoonlahti bus terminal in Lippulaiva shopping centre. Also in common with the first phase, many people were unhappy with the reorganisation of bus lines. Those living in Kivenlahti and Saunalahti, especially, were annoyed at direct bus lines into Kamppi, taking 25-30 minutes, being replaced with feeder lines to Espoonlahti, a transfer to the metro and a half-hour metro ride into the city centre.

== Network ==



The Helsinki metro system consists of 30 stations. The stations are located along a Y shape, where the main part runs from the Matinkylä through the center of the city towards the eastern suburbs. The line forks at the Itäkeskus metro station. 22 of the network&#x27;s stations are located below ground; all eight of those stations located above ground are in Helsinki.

Trains are generally operated as Kivenlahti–Vuosaari or Tapiola–Mellunmäki with some services running Kivenlahti–Mellunmäki in the early mornings and evenings. The rush-hour frequency of 24 tph in the central section between Tapiola and Itäkeskus was reduced to 20 tph from August 2022, due to a lack of drivers and rolling stock. All services stop at every station, and the names of the stations are announced in both Finnish and Swedish (with the exceptions of Central Railway Station, University of Helsinki and Aalto University, which are also announced in English).

The metro is designed as a core transport route, which means that extensive feeder bus transport links are provided between the stations and the surrounding districts. Taking a feeder bus to the metro is often the only option to get to the city centre from some districts. For example, since the construction of the metro, all daytime bus routes from the islands of Laajasalo terminate at the Herttoniemi metro station with no through routes from Laajasalo to the centre of Helsinki.

=== Lines ===
The Helsinki Metro is operated as two lines called M1 and M2, although these designations are not universally applied.

=== Accessibility ===
Some stations are located above ground level, making the metro system more friendly to passengers with mobility problems. Sub-surface stations have no stairs from the ticket hall to the platform, and one can access them from the street level via escalators or lifts. The trains themselves have no steps, and the floors of the trains are level with the platforms, with the gap between the two being just a couple of centimetres. Mobility scooters are not allowed, but trams have wheelchair accessible floors. A 2016 study found the metro trains and station &quot;fully accessible independently or with a helper&quot; but noted that the elevator to the metro had no signalization and required a detour to reach, along with being constantly dirty. It also considered the Kamppi station signs to be &quot;adequate but inconsistent&quot;, noting one elevator without braille instructions.

=== Ticketing ===
The ticketing scheme on the Metro is consistent with other forms of transport inside the city of Helsinki, managed by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) agency. The HSL travel card (&quot;matkakortti&quot;) is the most commonly used ticket, which can be paid either per journey or for a period of two weeks to one year. The metro stations between Koivusaari and Kulosaari lie within zone A. The stations between Keilaniemi and Matinkylä and from Herttoniemi to Mellunmäki or Vuosaari lie within the zone B, and from Finnoo to Kivenlahti in zone C, so an ABC ticket covers the entire system. Single tickets can be bought from ticket machines at the stations (except for the stations between Finnoo and Kivenlahti, which have no ticket machines) or via the HSL mobile app. A single ticket can be used to change to any other form of transport inside the HSL area with the validity time based on the number of zones purchased. There are no gates to the platforms; a proof-of-payment system is used instead.

=== Safety ===

Passenger safety instructions are inside train carriages above the doors and stations at ticket hall and platforms. These instructions direct passengers to use emergency phones and also include an emergency phone number to traffic center. Emergency stop handles at platforms discharge traction current and set nearby signals to danger. There are emergency brake handles inside the carriage next to the door.

Especially for people with visual impairments, all platforms have a yellow line marking the safe area on platform. Additionally, there are fire extinguishers on trains and in stations.

=== Rolling stock ===

The 750V DC current is drawn from a bottom-contact third rail alongside the running rails. Since the opening of the Länsimetro extension, trains are always formed with 4 carriages.

There are three different types of rolling stock in service on the system as of 2025. The first trains adopted on the system consisted of the M100 series that was built by Strömberg in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The newer M200 series was built by Bombardier and has been in service since 2000; each set is composed of two cars connected by an open gangway. The latest version, the M300 series, entered service in 2016, built by CAF. A further 5 M300 units were built in 2022 for the extension to Kivenlahti. Unlike the first two series, the M300 trains operate as 4-car sets with open gangways and were designed to run without drivers, though since the cancellation of the automation project, they retain their temporary cabs.

Line speed of the system is inside the tunnels and on the open portion of the network. Points have a maximum speed of , with some sets near termini having a maximum speed of . Technically the M200 and M100 series have a maximum speed of and , respectively, but they are electrically limited to .

=== Depots and facilities ===
The original maintenance and storage depot for the metro system is at , between the stations of Siilitie and Itäkeskus. The depot is connected to the metro line from both directions, with a third, central, platform at Itäkeskus used for empty services and during times of disruption. Both warm and cold storage is provided at the depot, to avoid having to pre-heat trains before service in the cold winters.

Behind the Roihupelto depot is the metro test track, allowing testing at speeds of up to ; the far end of this test-track was until 2012 connected via the non-electrified long and then to the VR main line at Oulunkylä railway station. Both the metro and railways share interoperable gauges. The old access line was mostly along the first two-thirds of the old Herttoniemi harbour railway. Through the area of Viikki, this single line had street running since 2002.

In 2012 the old depot link was closed and partially removed when a new metro link line was built from the then present end at Vuosaari metro station, to the electrified long in the new Vuosaari harbour. From 2019 the route of the old link line was redeveloped to form part of the Jokeri light rail line which was opened on 21 October 2023.

The new underground located between Kivenlahti and Espoonlahti stations, opened along with the second stage of Länsimetro on 3 December 2022.

== Future ==

===Eastern extension===

In 2018, a new zoning plan for the Östersundom area east of Helsinki, was confirmed. New homes are due to be built on the condition that the metro is extended eastwards to serve this area. The eastward extension of the metro has been named &quot;Itämetro&quot; (English: Eastern Metro, Swedish: Östmetron) as a counterpart to the western extension. The current plan is for the line to continue from Mellunmäki, briefly cross into Vantaa through Länsisalmi and then back into Helsinki through Itäsalmi, before continuing onwards over the municipal border to Majvik in Sipoo. Construction of the metro line is tentatively slated to begin in the 2030s at the earliest.

Proposals also exist for the line to be extended even further east into central Sipoo, possibly as far as to Sibbesborg, to an envisioned new city centre there.

=== Other ===

A second Metro line from Laajasalo via Kamppi to Pasila north of the city centre, and possibly onwards to Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, is also in the planning stages. This is being taken into consideration in city plans and has been discussed by the city assembly, but does not look likely to be seriously planned before the mid-2030s at the earliest. To prepare for this eventuality, a platform level for a crossing line was already excavated during the original construction of the Kamppi station.

The Ring Rail Line, which connects the airport to the rail network, began service in 2015. The current plans commissioned by the city recommend the extension of the tram network, instead of the metro, to Laajasalo. Thus construction of a second metro line along the Laajasalo–Kamppi–Airport route appears unlikely.

On 17 May 2006 the Helsinki city council decided that the current, manually driven metro trains would be replaced by automatic ones, operated without drivers. This project was cancelled in 2015 but the western extension was planned with this driverless operation in mind and the stations were built shorter than the existing ones which meant that the maximum train length for the whole system had to be reduced in 2017 when the western extension opened.

The system is planned to be automated eventually as the old M100 trains are approaching the end of their effective service lifespan.

There is a plan to extend the Vuosaari section of the line to the new Vuosaari harbour (see section The depot above).

A new station is being planned in Roihupelto, between Siilitie and Itäkeskus, to serve a possible future suburb.

== Unused stations ==
In addition to the metro stations already in operation, forward-looking design has led to a number of extra facilities being constructed in case they are needed in the future.

; Kamppi
: The current metro station lies in an east-west direction but there is a second metro station beneath it that was excavated at the same time of construction in 1981. This second station is perpendicular (north-south) to the first one and has platforms in length, slightly shorter than those above. Tunnels designed to eventually connect the two sets of lines curve off from the west-end of Kamppi. See also: Helsingin Sanomat published side elevation plan and photograph of second level.

; Hakaniemi
: Two station boxes were constructed in Hakaniemi. Intended for future expansion, the second is now unused. The unused area was subsequently designated for use as part of the mainline Helsinki City Rail Loop.

; Kaisaniemi (Helsingin Yliopisto)
: A second area exists below the current platforms, with the intention to allow for future expansion.

; Munkkivuori
: The designers of Finland&#x27;s first shopping centre were very enthusiastic about the rumoured plans for a metro system all over Helsinki – something that would not appear for another 20 years. Built in 1964, the station does not fit into any plans of future metro lines and is unlikely to be ever used. The platform area is partially littered with building-rubble from more recent construction works in the area and the only visible evidence of the ahead-of-its-time station are a pair of large escalators. The escalators lead down from the main part of the shopping mall to the below-ground area where the ticket office would have been. The entrance to the lower level is behind the strange-shaped photographic shop.

;Pasila
:A metro station was excavated beneath the Mall of Tripla shopping center. It is not known whether the station will ever be actually used as a metro station as only tentative plans exist for a metro line through Pasila. The rationale behind constructing it was that it was cheaper and easier to do it while the mall was being constructed on top of it than to build it under an existing shopping center in the future. The possibility of a Pasila metro line will be considered some time after the year 2036. Meanwhile the metro station will be used for activities such as beach volley and indoor surfing.

== Statistics ==
According to the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) yearly report for 2019, the metro system had a total of 92.6 million passengers. According to the yearly report for 2003, the total turnover for the metro division of Helsinki City Transport (HKL) was €16.9 million and it made a profit of €3.8 million.

The Metro is by far the cheapest form of transport in Helsinki to operate, with a cost of only €0.032 per passenger kilometre. The same figure for the second cheapest form – trams – was €0.211.

In 2002, the Metro used 39.8 GWh of electricity, though the figure was rising (from 32.2 GWh in 2001). This equals 0.10 kWh per passenger kilometre, and compares favourably with Helsinki&#x27;s trams (which used 0.19 kWh per passenger kilometre in 2002).

In 2021, the Metro used 64.4 GWh of electricity, however it is notable that the increase is due to expansion of the network.

<text>The following is a list of people executed by the [[U.S. state]] of [[South Dakota]] from 1877 to date. A total of 20 people have been executed in South Dakota since 1877. Prior to 1915, the sole method of execution was via hanging. South Dakota banned the death penalty in 1915, but it was reinstated in 1939. The method of execution was then changed to electrocution.

Capital punishment was reinstated in South Dakota in 1979 following the U.S. Supreme Court decision of &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;. The method of execution was changed from electrocution to lethal injection in 1984. Since 1979, a total of 5 people have been executed, all by lethal injection.

<text>Baron Inglewood, of Hutton in the Forest in the County of Cumberland, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 

It was created on 30 June 1964 for the Conservative politician William Fletcher-Vane. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. William Lyonel Vane, younger brother of Henry Vane, 9th Baron Barnard, who had succeeded to the barony of Barnard in 1891 on the death of his distant relative Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland and 8th Baron Barnard. William Lyonel Vane and his brother, the ninth Baron Barnard, were both great-great-grandsons of Hon. Morgan Vane, younger son of Gilbert Vane, 2nd Baron Barnard, whose eldest son, the third Baron, was created Earl of Darlington, and from whom the Dukes of Cleveland descended. 

The family seat is Hutton in the Forest, near Penrith, Cumbria. The title and the name of the house refer to the ancient Royal Forest of Inglewood.

 the title is held by his eldest son, the second Baron, who succeeded in 1989. He is also a Conservative politician and one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. Created in 1964, the barony of Inglewood is one of the last hereditary baronies created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Barons Inglewood (1964)==
*William Morgan Fletcher-Vane, 1st Baron Inglewood (1909–1989)
*William Richard Fletcher-Vane, 2nd Baron Inglewood (born 1951)

<doc id="416114" wikidata="Q409205" url="?curid=416114" title="Xenobiotic">
<text>A xenobiotic is a chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced or expected to be present within the organism. It can also cover substances that are present in much higher concentrations than are usual. Natural compounds can also become xenobiotics if they are taken up by another organism, such as the uptake of natural human hormones by fish found downstream of sewage treatment plant outfalls, or the chemical defenses produced by some organisms as protection against predators. The term &quot;xenobiotic&quot; is also used to refer to organs transplanted from one species to another.

The term &quot;xenobiotics&quot;, however, is very often used in the context of pollutants such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls and their effect on the biota, because xenobiotics are understood as substances foreign to an entire biological system, i.e. artificial substances, which did not exist in nature before their synthesis by humans. The term xenobiotic and βίος (bios) = life, plus the Greek suffix for adjectives -τικός, -ή, -όν (-tikos, -ē, -on). Xenobiotics may be grouped as carcinogens, drugs, environmental pollutants, food additives, hydrocarbons, and pesticides.

==Xenobiotic metabolism==

The body removes xenobiotics by xenobiotic metabolism. This consists of the deactivation and the excretion of xenobiotics and happens mostly in the liver. Excretion routes are urine, feces, breath, and sweat. Hepatic enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotics by first activating them (oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and/or hydration of the xenobiotic), and then conjugating the active secondary metabolite with glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, or glutathione, followed by excretion in bile or urine. An example of a group of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism is hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450. These enzymes that metabolize xenobiotics are very important for the pharmaceutical industry because they are responsible for the breakdown of medications. A species with this unique cytochrome P450 system is Drosophila mettleri, which uses xenobiotic resistance to exploit a wider nesting range including both soil moistened with necrotic exudates and necrotic plots themselves.

Although the body is able to remove xenobiotics by reducing it to a less toxic form through xenobiotic metabolism then excreting it, it is also possible for it to be converted into a more toxic form in some cases. This process is referred to as bioactivation and can result in structural and functional changes to the microbiota. Exposure to xenobiotics can disrupt the microbiome community structure, either by increasing or decreasing the size of certain bacterial populations depending on the substance. Functional changes that result vary depending on the substance and can include increased expression in genes involved in stress response and antibiotic resistance, changes in the levels of metabolites produced, etc.

Organisms can also evolve to tolerate xenobiotics. An example is the co-evolution of the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the Common Garter Snake. In this predator–prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of resistance in the snake. This evolutionary response is based on the snake evolving modified forms of the ion channels that the toxin acts upon, so becoming resistant to its effects. Another example of a xenobiotic tolerance mechanism is the use of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which is largely exhibited in insects. Such transporters contribute to resistance by enabling the transport of toxins across the cell membrane, thus preventing accumulation of these substances within cells.

==Xenobiotics in the environment==

Xenobiotic substances are an issue for sewage treatment systems, since they are many in number, and each will present its own problems as to how to remove them (and whether it is worth trying to)

Some xenobiotics substances are resistant to degradation. Xenobiotics such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and trichloroethylene (TCE) accumulate in the environment due to their recalcitrant properties and have become an environmental concern due to their toxicity and accumulation. This occurs particularly in the subsurface environment and water sources, as well as in biological systems, having the potential to impact human health. Some of the main sources of pollution and the introduction of xenobiotics into the environment come from large industries such as pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels, pulp and paper bleaching and agriculture. For example, they may be synthetic organochlorides such as plastics and pesticides, or naturally occurring organic chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and some fractions of crude oil and coal.

Microorganisms may be a viable solution to this issue of environmental pollution by the degradation of the xenobiotics; a process known as bioremediation. Microorganisms are able to adapt to xenobiotics introduced into the environment through horizontal gene transfer, in order to make use of such compounds as energy sources. This process can be further altered to manipulate the metabolic pathways of microorganisms in order to degrade harmful xenobiotics under specific environmental conditions at a more desirable rate. Mechanisms of bioremediation include both genetically engineering microorganisms and isolating the naturally occurring xenobiotic degrading microbes. Research has been conducted to identify the genes responsible for the ability of microorganisms to metabolize certain xenobiotics and it has been suggested that this research can be used in order to engineer microorganisms specifically for this purpose. Not only can current pathways be engineered to be expressed in other organisms, but the creation of novel pathways is a possible approach.

Xenobiotics may be limited in the environment and difficult to access in areas such as the subsurface environment. Degradative organisms can be engineered to increase mobility in order to access these compounds, including enhanced chemotaxis. One limitation of the bioremediation process is that optimal conditions are required for proper metabolic functioning of certain microorganisms, which may be difficult to meet in an environmental setting. In some cases a single microorganism may not be capable of performing all metabolic processes required for degradation of a xenobiotic compound and so &quot;syntrophic bacterial consortia&quot; may be employed. In this case, a group of bacteria work in conjunction, resulting in dead end products from one organism being further degraded by another organism. In other cases, the products of one microorganisms may inhibit the activity another, and thus a balance must be maintained.

Many xenobiotics produce a variety of biological effects, which is used when they are characterized using bioassay. Before they can be registered for sale in most countries, xenobiotic pesticides must undergo extensive evaluation for risk factors, such as toxicity to humans, ecotoxicity, or persistence in the environment. For example, during the registration process, the herbicide, cloransulam-methyl was found to degrade relatively quickly in soil.

==Inter-species organ transplantation==

The term xenobiotic is also used to refer to organs transplanted from one species 
to another. For example, some researchers hope that hearts and other organs could be transplanted from pigs to humans. Many people die every year whose lives could have been saved if a critical organ had been available for transplant. Kidneys are
currently the most commonly transplanted organ. Xenobiotic organs would need to be developed in such a way that they would not be rejected by the immune system.

<text>Santa Cruz Island (Spanish: &quot;Isla Santa Cruz&quot;, Chumash: &quot;Limuw&quot;) is located off the southwestern coast of Ventura, California, United States. It is the largest island in California and largest of the eight islands in the Channel Islands archipelago and Channel Islands National Park. Forming part of the northern group of the Channel Islands, Santa Cruz is long and wide with an area of .

The island&#x27;s coastline has steep cliffs, large sea caves, coves, and sandy beaches. The highest point is Devils Peak, at . A central valley splits the island along the Santa Cruz Island Fault, with volcanic rock on the north and older sedimentary rock on the south. This volcanic rock was heavily fractured during an uplift phase that formed the island, and over a hundred large sea caves have been carved into the resulting faults. The largest is Painted Cave, among the world&#x27;s largest.

The island is part of Santa Barbara County, California. The 2000 census showed a population of two people. Santa Cruz is the largest privately owned island off the contiguous United States. Ownership is split between the National Park Service (24%) and the Nature Conservancy (76%).

Public passenger access to the eastern portion of Santa Cruz Island is provided by the Island Packers ferry service out of the Ventura Harbor.

==History==

===Early history===
Archaeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 10,000 years. It was known as Limuw (place of the sea) or Michumash in the Chumash language. The Chumash people who lived on the island developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization, and trade with the mainland population. Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo first observed the island in 1542, later estimated to be inhabited by 2,000 to 3,000 Chumash on the three northern Channel Islands, with 11 villages on Santa Cruz.

In 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno led the last Spanish expedition to California. His map named Santa Cruz Island the &quot;Isla de Gente Barbuda&quot; (island of the bearded people). Between 1602 and 1769, no recorded European contact with the island existed. Finally, in 1769, the land-and-sea expedition of Don Gaspar de Portolà reached Santa Cruz Island. Traveling with him were Father Juan González Vizcaíno and Father Francisco Palóu. Father Palóu wrote of Father Vizcaíno&#x27;s visit to the Santa Cruz village of Xaxas, that the missionaries on the ship went ashore and &quot;they were well received by the heathen and presented with fish, in return for which the Indians were given some strings of beads.&quot; 

The island was considered for the establishment of a Catholic mission to serve the large Chumash population. When Mission San Buenaventura was founded across the channel in 1782, the slow religious conversion of the Santa Cruz Chumash commenced. Beset by diseases such as measles, the Chumash declined in numbers until 1822, when the last Chumash left the island for mainland California missions.

The name of Santa Cruz for the island came about when Gaspar de Portola expedition visited the Chumash village Xaxas on the island. On the next day, the Chumash returned a staff topped by an iron cross, which the Spanish had inadvertently left behind. Hence, the name &quot;La Isla de la Santa Cruz&quot; (Island of the Holy Cross) appeared on their exploration map of 1770. George Vancouver used the same name on his 1793 map.

With Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government asserted its control over Alta California. To increase the Mexican presence, the government began sending convicted criminals to California in 1830. Around 80 prisoners were sent to Santa Barbara, where, upon arrival, 31 incorrigibles were sent to Santa Cruz Island. They lived briefly in an area now known as Prisoners&#x27; Harbor before escaping to the mainland.

===Mexican land grant===
Governor Juan Alvarado made a Mexican land grant of the Island of Santa Cruz to his aide Captain Andrés Castillero in 1839. When California became a state in 1850, the United States government, through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, required that land previously granted by Spanish and Mexican governments be proved before the Board of Land Commissioners. A claim was filed with the Land Commission in 1852, confirmed by the US Supreme Court in 1860. The grant was patented to Andrés Castillero in 1867. Castillero transferred title to his agent William Barron in 1857.

===Ranching===
William Barron was a San Francisco businessman and co-owner of Barron, Forbes &amp; Co. Dr. James Barron Shaw was hired to manage things and charged by Barron to start a sheep operation. He built corrals and houses for himself and his employees and expanded the road system. He imported cattle, horses, and sheep to the island and erected one of the earliest wharves along the California coast at Prisoners&#x27; Harbor. Shaw was the first rancher to ship sheep to San Francisco by steamer, some selling at $30 per animal. By 1869, the year he left Santa Cruz, Shaw&#x27;s island sheep ranch was well known, and some 24,000 sheep grazed the hills and valleys of Santa Cruz Island. At that time, the gross proceeds from the ranch on Santa Cruz Island were supposedly $50,000. Barron sold the island for $150,000 in 1869, and Shaw left for San Francisco and Los Alamos, where he continued ranching.

Ten investors from San Francisco purchased the island, headed by Gustave Mahé. One of the investors, Justinian Caire, was a French immigrant and founder of a successful San Francisco hardware business (Justinian Caire Company) that sold equipment to miners and by 1886 Caire had acquired all of the shares of the Santa Cruz Island Company which he and his colleagues had founded in 1869. He then implemented his vision of building a self-sustaining sheep and cattle ranch, vineyard, and a nut and fruit grove operation on the island. Main Ranch was augmented with nine other ranches, Prisoners&#x27; Harbor, Christy, Scorpion, Smugglers, Forney&#x27;s Cove/Rancho Nuevo, Poso, Buena Vista Portezuela, and Sur Ranch. In 1885, he operated the largest private telephone system in the US then. A post office operated from 1895 until 1903, while there were 110 workers on the island in 1889. The operation received water from four springs, El Pato, Gallina, The Dindos, and The Peacock, which fed into a reservoir, tanks, and dams. The vineyard was planted in 1884, and by 1895, the winery was maturing from the vineyard.

Justinian Caire&#x27;s will stipulated that his two sons, Arthur and Frederic, were to be executors of his will and continue managing operations with little change. However, Justinian signed over to his wife Albina, who had all shares in the Justinian Caire Company and Santa Cruz Company the year before he died in 1897. His sons continued a successful livestock, winemaking and ranching industry on the island after his death, at least until Albina distributed Santa Cruz Island Company shares amongst her children between late 1910 and early 1911. Albina, Fred, Arthur, Delphine, and Helene received 86 percent of the stock, while the two married daughters Amelie and Aglaë received 14 percent. Beginning in 1910, Caire&#x27;s two married daughters brought an extended and complicated litigation against their mother and four siblings. The married daughters&#x27; families, led by in-law Ambrose Gherini, retained on the island&#x27;s east end. In 1936, the Caire family reportedly offered 90% of the island for $750,000 to California for use as a state or federal park, but nothing came of it. Most of Caire&#x27;s descendants were compelled to sell it in 1937 to pay their legal costs.

The buyer was Los Angeles oilman Edwin Stanton. Stanton&#x27;s purchase of the major part of Santa Cruz Island brought a major shift in agricultural production on the island. After trying for a short time to continue the sheep operation, bringing in 10,000 head, he decided to switch to beef production. At the time, the beef industry in California was growing rapidly, with Santa Barbara County among the top ten beef producers in the state.
Edwin Stanton&#x27;s ranch on Santa Cruz Island saw changes that reflected the evolution of cattle ranching in a working landscape. While retaining most of the 19th-century structures dating from the Caire period, Stanton constructed a few buildings to meet the needs of his cattle ranch, the most notable of which is Rancho del Norte on the isthmus. Pasture fencing and corrals were altered to suit the cattle operation, and an extensive water system was added to provide water to the cattle.

The Gherini family, descendants of Justinian Caire&#x27;s two daughters, continued their sheep ranching operations on the east end of Santa Cruz Island until 1984, using Scorpion Ranch as their base. This area was east of the Montañon range, including Scorpion Harbor and Smugglers Cove. They managed the island with resident managers and laborers and often worked as a family during shearing and during the summer. Production dropped during the 1970s and 1980s, and the expense of ranching on a remote island rose.

===National Park and Nature Conservancy preserve===

Protracted litigation between the Gherinis and the federal government started in 1980 when Channel Islands National Park was designated. Congress authorized the purchase of the family&#x27;s remaining land, about 10% of the island on the east end. However, the purchase was held up as family members pushed the federal government to pay what they believed was the appropriate amount. In the early 1990s, the government bought the interests of Francis Gherini&#x27;s three siblings for about $4 million apiece. However, the former Oxnard attorney insisted that the offer was too low, keeping his 25% interest in the ranch and leaving the Park Service with 75%, effectively blocking the park&#x27;s establishment. After 16 years of negotiation, in November 1996, government officials settled with Gherini for $14 million, which included $2 million in back interest, clearing the way for the park to be opened to the public. The last of the 10,000 sheep on the island were removed by 1999.

With Edwin Stanton&#x27;s death in 1964, his widow and son, Carey, re-incorporated the Santa Cruz Island Company and continued the cattle operations on the island. Carey Stanton died unexpectedly in 1987 at the ranch and was buried in the family plot in the island chapel yard at the Main Ranch. The real property passed to The Nature Conservancy through a prior agreement that Carey Stanton had established with the non-profit organization. The Nature Conservancy rapidly liquidated the cattle operation and ended the ranching era on the island.
 They also were able to eliminate the last of the feral pigs by 2006. The removal of the pigs took a total of 14 months. It was accomplished through trapping, aerial shooting from helicopters, ground-based hunting with dogs, and the use of sterilized adult pigs with radio collars to locate surviving pigs. The time taken to eradicate pigs on Santa Cruz Island was about half that taken on a neighboring island of similar size (Santa Rosa Island) A gift of from the Nature Conservancy to the park was completed in 2000.

The National Park Service owns and operates approximately 24% of Santa Cruz Island. The remaining land, known as the Santa Cruz Island Reserve, is used for scientific research and education and is managed by a combination of organizations, including The Nature Conservancy, the University of California Natural Reserve System, and the Santa Cruz Island Foundation. The Reserve and its staff provide accommodations for visiting students and researchers.

===Other uses===

Santa Cruz was a base for otter hunters, fishermen, and smugglers. The Channel Islands often provided smugglers and bootleggers with convenient yet isolated hideaways to store their goods. One such area is known today as Smugglers Cove.

George Nidever recalled hunting otter at Santa Cruz in the winter of 1835–36. Working from a base camp at Santa Rosa Island, he and two others obtained 60 skins that season. Fishermen encamped on the island, trading fish for other goods from passing boats.

Several movies were shot on the island, including &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;The Rescue&quot;.

The Richfield Oil Corporation acquired an exploration lease in 1954 but did not find oil.

UC Santa Barbara established a summer geology class in 1963, and the Santa Cruz Island Field Station in 1966.

The Santa Cruz Island Hunt Club operated from 1966 until 1985, beginning as a sheep and pig hunting during a rifle season and an archery season.

The United States military began to use Santa Cruz Island during World War II, and has constructed and maintained strategic installations on the island. Like all of the Channel Islands, Santa Cruz Island was used as an early warning outpost for observing enemy planes and ships during World War II. During the Cold War a communications station was installed as a part of the Pacific Missile Range Facility. This station remains in operation, although not at the levels of use seen in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Wildlife, plants, and climate==

Santa Cruz Island is home to some endemic species of animals and plants, including the Santa Cruz Island fox (&quot;Urocyon littoralis santacruzae&quot;), a subspecies of the island fox.

Introduced and invasive species on Santa Cruz Island include:

* Golden eagle (invader), which replaced the native bald eagle, and hunted island foxes to threatened status. Attracted initially by the presence of pigs.
* Fennel (introduced), served as cover for Island foxes, but as forage for the feral pigs. 
* Feral pigs (introduced), displaced native island foxes. No longer present as of 2006.
* Santa Cruz sheep, no longer present.
* Santa Cruz Island horse, no longer present as of 1999.

Native species include:
* Island Spotted Skunk 
* Island scrub-jay, which is only found on Santa Cruz Island
* Hoffman&#x27;s rockcress, which is found only from Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island.
* Island manzanita and whitehair manzanita, shrubs which are endemic to Santa Cruz Island.
* Island fence lizard, endemic to the Channel Islands of California
* Island foxes are indigenous to the island. Roughly the size of housecats, island foxes are unafraid of humans. They can be seen with regularity in most of the campgrounds on Santa Cruz Island. The Santa Cruz Island Fox (&quot;Urocyon littoralis santacruzae)&quot; is the subspecies of Island Fox native to Santa Cruz Island.

The native plant communities of Santa Cruz Island include chaparral, oak woodland, Bishop pine (&quot;Pinus muriacata&quot;) forest, grassland and coastal sage scrub. Where sheep grazing was prevalent, the native plant cover has been damaged, and erosion and gullying has been a problem in some areas. The native plant communities are slowly recovering since the removal of feral sheep and pigs.

===Bald eagle reintroduction===
Bald eagles were once numerous on California&#x27;s Channel Islands. Because of eggshell thinning caused by DDT and other factors, successful bald eagle nesting in the northern Channel Islands ended by 1949. By the 1960s, bald eagles could no longer be found on any of the Channel Islands.

, there were five breeding pairs on Santa Cruz Island, two on Santa Rosa, and one on Anacapa, and a total of over 40 bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands. Between 2002 and 2006, the Channel Islands National Park (in conjunction with partner, Institute for Wildlife Studies) introduced sixty-one young bald eagles to the northern Channel Islands, using a &quot;hacking&quot; process of keeping 8 weeks old eagles in one of two hack towers on Santa Cruz Island, until at age three months, they were ready to fly. On the Channel Islands, where large trees are scarce, bald eagles have built nests on cliff faces, rock shelves and shallow cliffs, as well as in island pines and Torrey pines. One pair attempted nesting in a grassland on Santa Cruz Island. In 2006, for the first time in over 50 years, a bald eagle hatched on Santa Cruz Island.

Because nesting bald eagles can deter golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) from breeding, the recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands has also helped enable recovery of the endangered island fox. Golden eagle predation had been responsible for the steep decline of island foxes on the northern Channel Islands in the 1990s.

===Climate===
The climate of Santa Cruz Island is marine temperate, with frosts rare and snow almost unknown except very rarely on the highest mountain slopes. Annual rainfall varies from about on the shoreline, to on the highest mountain slopes. Precipitation is highly variable from year to year, with wet years alternating with drought years. Most of the rain falls from November to March. Summers are dry, but often overcast and cool with coastal fog.

==Transportation==
Santa Cruz Island has several airstrips, all operated by The Nature Conservancy:
* Santa Cruz Island Airport had one turf runway with orientation 9/27 and was located at . The airport is no longer registered or active.
* Christy Airstrip has a turf runway with orientation 9/27 and is located at .
* Santa Cruz Ranch Airport has a turf runway with orientation 9/27 and is located at .

<doc id="416117" wikidata="Q1150358" url="?curid=416117" title="Empress Dowager Ci'an">
<text>Empress Xiaozhenxian (12 August 1837 – 8 April 1881), of the Manchu Bordered Yellow Banner Niohuru clan, was a posthumous name bestowed to the wife and empress consort of Yizhu, the Xianfeng Emperor. She was empress consort of Qing from 1852 until her husband&#x27;s death in 1861, after which she was honored as Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an.

As empress dowager and one of the most senior members of the imperial family, she and Empress Dowager Cixi became co-regents during the reign of two young emperors: Zaichun, the Tongzhi Emperor and later Zaitian, the Guangxu Emperor. Although in principle, she had precedence over Cixi, Ci&#x27;an was in fact a self-effacing person and seldom intervened in politics, but she was the decision-maker in most family affairs. Instead, Empress Dowager Cixi was the decision-maker in most state affairs.

A popular view of Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an is that she was a highly respectable person, always quiet, never hot-tempered, and that she treated everybody very well and was highly respected by the Xianfeng Emperor. However, some historians have painted a very different reality, mainly that of a self-indulgent and idle Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, who did not care as much for government and hard work as she cared for the pleasures and sweet life inside the Forbidden City.

==Life==
===Family background===
Empress Xiaozhenxian&#x27;s personal name was not recorded in history.

* Father: Muyang&#x27;a (), served as an official in Guangxi, and held the title of a third class duke ()
** Paternal grandfather: Fukejing&#x27;a ()
** Paternal grandmother: Lady Aisin Gioro
** Paternal aunt: Lady Niohuru, Duanhua&#x27;s primary consort, the maternal grandmother of Empress Xiaozheyi (1854–1875)
* Mother: Lady Giyanggiya
* One brother: Guangke
* One sister: Lady Niohuru, primary consort of Prince Zhuanghou of the first rank, Yiren

Xiaozhenxian was a descendant of Eidu (1562–1621), one of the top five generals who served under Nurhaci (the founder of the Qing dynasty), through Eidu&#x27;s third son, Celge (車爾格; d. 1647).

The future empress&#x27; great-grandfather, Fukejing&#x27;a (福克精阿), served as a management official in Xining and held the title of a baron. Her grandfather, Cebutan (策布坦; d. 1794), served as a second-rank commander in Shanxi Province and also held the title of a baron. Her father, Muyang&#x27;a (d. before 1852), served as an official in Guangxi Province and held the title of a third class &quot;cheng&#x27;en&quot; duke. Muyang&#x27;a&#x27;s primary consort was the granddaughter of Qingheng (慶恆; d. 1779), a great-grandson of Nurhaci, but it was Lady Jiang (姜氏), a concubine of Muyang&#x27;a, who was Xiaozhenxian&#x27;s birth mother. Her brother, Guangke (廣科; d. 1880), served as a general in Hangzhou. Her aunt married Duanhua (Prince Zheng), a prominent noble and close adviser of the Xianfeng Emperor.

===Daoguang era===
The future Empress Xiaozhenxian was born on the 12th day of the seventh lunar month in the 17th year of the reign of the Daoguang Emperor, which translates to 12 August 1837 in the Gregorian calendar.

===Xianfeng era===
When the Daoguang Emperor died on 15 February 1850, his fourth son, Yizhu, succeeded him and was enthroned as the Xianfeng Emperor. The Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s primary consort had died a month before the emperor&#x27;s coronation and was posthumously honoured as &quot;Empress Xiaodexian&quot;. The process of selecting a new primary consort to be the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s empress consort, however, was delayed due to the mourning period for the Daoguang Emperor.

The auditions for the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s consorts took place in 1851 in the Forbidden City. Lady Niohuru was among the candidates shortlisted by Dowager Consort Kangci, the highest ranked living consort of the Daoguang Emperor at the time. However, some sources claimed that Lady Niohuru entered the Forbidden City in the late 1840s and became a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor, who was still known as the Fourth Prince then.

Lady Niohuru&#x27;s status within the palace rose rapidly. On 14 June 1852, she was granted the title &quot;Concubine Zhen&quot; (&quot;Zhen&quot; meaning &quot;upright&quot;, &quot;chaste&quot;, &quot;virtuous&quot;, or &quot;faithful to the memory of one&#x27;s husband&quot;, i.e., by remaining chaste after his death and not remarrying). In late June or early July 1852, she was elevated to &quot;Noble Consort Zhen&quot;. On 24 July 1852, she was officially designated as the Empress. As Empress, she was put in charge of the emperor&#x27;s harem. Some sources claim that Lady Niohuru was already designated as the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s primary spouse after the death of her predecessor, Empress Xiaodexian.

Imperial customs required that the emperor spend one day a month with the empress. The Empress remained childless. On 27 April 1856, another of the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s consorts, Concubine Yi (the future Empress Dowager Cixi), gave birth to the emperor&#x27;s first son, Zaichun. Some biographers mentioned that the Empress gave birth to the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s only daughter, Princess Rong&#x27;an of the First Rank, who was actually born to Concubine Li. However, as Empress, Lady Niohuru was nominally the mother of all the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s children, regardless of whether or not she was their birth mother. Consequently, it was the Empress who raised the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s children and decided their punishment when they did not obey her. Concubine Yi had little to say in her son&#x27;s upbringing. She once recalled, &quot;I had... quite a lot of trouble with (the Empress) and found it very difficult to keep on good terms with her.&quot;

===Tongzhi era===

On 22 August 1861, in the wake of the Second Opium War, the Xianfeng Emperor died at the Rehe Traveling Palace (), northeast of Beijing, where he and his imperial court had fled to when the Anglo-French forces closed in on the Forbidden City. He was succeeded by his sole surviving son, Zaichun, who was only five years old then; Zaichun was enthroned as the Tongzhi Emperor. A power struggle broke out between two factions over the issue of who should assume the regency until Zaichun was old enough to rule on his own. On his deathbed, the Xianfeng Emperor had appointed his close adviser Sushun and seven others to be the regents. However, Noble Consort Yi, the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s birth mother, also wanted to assume the regency. The Empress initially agreed to cooperate with Sushun and his seven co-regents, but changed her mind after being persuaded by Noble Consort Yi. In November 1861, with aid from Yixin, Prince Gong, the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s sixth brother, and, Yixuan, Prince Chun, the Xianfeng&#x27;s seventh brother, and husband of Noble Consort Yi&#x27;s younger sister, Yehenara Wanzhen, the Empress and Noble Consort Yi staged a coup – historically known as the Xinyou Coup – against the eight regents and ousted them from power, thereby securing control of the regency.

Noble Consort Yi was elevated to the status of Empress Dowager and honoured as &quot;Holy Mother, Empress Dowager&quot; (聖母皇太后), since she was not the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s primary wife and became Empress Dowager only as the biological mother of the reigning Tongzhi Emperor. She was given the honorific name &quot;Cixi&quot;. The Empress, on the other hand, as the former Emperor&#x27;s primary wife and the reigning Emperor&#x27;s nominal mother, was also elevated to Empress Dowager and honoured as &quot;Mother Empress, Empress Dowager&quot; (母后皇太后) – a title which gave her precedence over Empress Dowager Cixi – and was given the honorific name &quot;Ci&#x27;an&quot;. Because her living quarters were in the eastern part of the Forbidden City, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an was informally referred to as the &quot;East Empress Dowager&quot;; Empress Dowager Cixi, who lived in the western part, was also informally known as the &quot;West Empress Dowager&quot;. Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an spent most of her life in the Palace of Gathering Essence. On several occasions after 1861, Ci&#x27;an was given additional honorific names (two Chinese characters at a time), as was customary for emperors and empresses, until by the end of her life her name was a long even string of characters beginning with Ci&#x27;an.

Imperial records did not explain why there was a difference of 24 hours between the times when the Empress Niohuru and Noble Consort Yi were elevated from their original statuses to the same position of empress dowager. According to Tony Teng, Noble Consort Yi and Sushun had a quarrel over the granting of honours after the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s death. It is believed that the Empress, as the primary wife of the recently deceased emperor, had supported Noble Consort Yi, thus forcing Sushun to yield.

The two empresses dowager were appointed joint &quot;de facto&quot; regents for the Tongzhi Emperor. Because women were not allowed to be seen during imperial court sessions, they had to sit behind a curtain while attending such sessions together with the child emperor. Although in principle she had precedence over Cixi, Ci&#x27;an was in fact a self-effacing person and seldom intervened in politics, unlike Cixi, who actually controlled the imperial court. As &quot;de facto&quot; ruler, Ci&#x27;an had to learn about politics, so she and Cixi studied history. In November 1861, in keeping with the imperial custom, they began to consult the records of their Manchu predecessors. In June 1863, they had the contents of &quot;Tong Jian Ji Lan&quot; (通鑑輯覽) explained to them. About a year earlier, an earlier compilation by scholars from the Hanlin Academy, entitled &quot;A Valuable Mirror for Excellent Governance&quot; (治平寶鑑), became the text for a series of lectures by scholars and officials that the empresses dowager attended for over two years, the last lecture given in November 1866.

It is thought by many biographers that Cixi was the actual power behind the throne. Despite this, for the first 20 years of her regency she was not allowed to make decisions on her own. Any decree needed the approval of both regents. Both Ci&#x27;an and the Tongzhi Emperor were given a seal, but because the emperor was underage, the seal was given to his mother, Cixi. Ci&#x27;an&#x27;s seal was engraved with &quot;Yushang&quot; (Imperial Award) and Cixi&#x27;s with &quot;Tongdaotang&quot; (Hall of Accord with the Way).

====The case of An Dehai====
The years after the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s death were called the Tongzhi Restoration. It was a period of peace; the Taiping Rebellion and the Opium Wars with the British ceased. The treasury began growing again after decades of depletion. Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an was little mentioned during this period and her only notable intervention in politics was in 1869. An Dehai, a court eunuch and close aide of Empress Dowager Cixi, was on a trip south to purchase a set of dragon robes for Cixi. While travelling in Shandong Province, he abused his authority by extorting money from people and causing trouble. Ding Baozhen, the Governor of Shandong, reported An Dehai&#x27;s deeds to the imperial court. Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an received news about it and drafted an imperial decree as follows:
Ding Baozhen reports that a eunuch has been creating disturbance in Shandong Province. According to the magistrate of Dezhou, a eunuch surnamed An and his followers passed through that place by the way of the imperial canal, in two dragon barges, with much display of pomp and pageantry. He announced that he had come on an imperial mission to procure dragon robes. His barges flew a black banner, bearing in its centre the triple imperial emblems of the sun, and there were also dragon and phoenix flags flying on both side, of his vessels. A goodly company of both sexes were in the attendance on this person; there were female musicians, skilled in the use of string and wind instruments. The banks of the canal were lined with crowds of spectators, who witnessed with amazement and admiration his progress. The 21st day of the last month happened to be this eunuch&#x27;s birthday, so he arrayed himself in dragon robes and stood on the foredeck of his barge, to receive the homage of his suite. The local magistrate was just about to order his arrest when the barges set sail and proceeded southwards. The governor adds that he has already given orders for his immediate arrest. 
We are dumbfounded at his report. How can we ever hope to uphold moral standards within the palace and frighten evildoers unless we make an example of this insolent eunuch, who was dared to leave Beijing without permission and commit these lawless deeds? The governors of these three provinces of Shandong, Henan and Jiangsu are ordered to seek out and arrest the eunuch An whom we had formerly honored with the rank of the sixth grade and the decoration of the crow&#x27;s feather. Upon his being duly identified by his companions, let him be forth with beheaded, without further formalities, no attention is to be paid to any crafty explanations which he may attempt to make. The governors concerned will be held responsible in the event of failure to affect his arrest.
An Dehai was beheaded on 12 September 1869. This was quite an unusual reaction for Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, and the execution of An Dehai is said to have greatly displeased Empress Dowager Cixi. Some sources say that Prince Kung forced Ci&#x27;an to take an independent decision for a change. Several days after the arrest an edict was issued by Ci&#x27;an:

&quot;Ding Baozhen now reports that the eunuch was arrested in Tai&#x27;an Prefecture and has been summarily beheaded. Our dynasty&#x27;s house law is most strict in regard to the proper discipline of eunuchs, and provides severe punishment for any offences to which they may commit. They have always been sternly forbidden to make expeditions to the provinces, or to create trouble. Nevertheless, An Dehai actually had brazen effrontery to violate this law, and for his crimes his execution is only a fitting reward. In future, let all eunuchs take warning by his example; should we have further cause of complaint, the chief eunuchs of the several departments of the household will be punished as well as the actual offender. Any eunuch who may hereafter pretend that he has been sent on imperial business to the provinces shall be cast into chains at once, and sent to Beijing for punishment&quot;.
====The Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s marriage and death====
In 1872, both Ci&#x27;an and Cixi agreed it was time for the Tongzhi Emperor to marry. As the highest-ranking woman in the Forbidden City, Ci&#x27;an was put in charge of selecting the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s new empress and consorts. It was decided that a girl from the Mongol Alute clan (the later Empress Xiaozheyi) would become the new empress. Lady Alute&#x27;s mother was Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an&#x27;s cousin from her father&#x27;s side. After the wedding, both empresses dowager resigned as co-regents, but they resumed the regency in December 1874 during the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s illness. In January 1875, the Tongzhi emperor died, at the age of eighteen. As Tongzhi was childless, Cixi&#x27;s nephew, Zaitian, the son of Prince Chun, the brother of the long deceased Xianfeng emperor, and Wanzhen, Cixi&#x27;s younger sister, was selected to ascend to the throne as Emperor Guangxu. As the Guangxu Emperor was also underage at the time of his accession, the two empresses dowager became the regents again.

===Guangxu era===
During the late 1870s, Empress Dowager Cixi became ill from liver problems, so Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an had to rule on her own. During this time, she had to deal with the war with the Russian Empire over Ili Prefecture. In 1871, the Dungan Revolt broke out in Xinjiang. The Qing Empire soon lost power and the Russians occupied the Ili basin region. The Qing government regained control over Xinjiang in 1877. In 1879, the Russians suggested that they maintain a strong presence in the region but the Qing government did not agree. The conflict ended with the signing of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in February 1881.

Although Ci&#x27;an rarely left the Forbidden City, she did visit the imperial tombs to pay respect to her husband and ancestors. In 1880, while at the Eastern Qing tombs, Ci&#x27;an, probably encouraged by Prince Kung to assert herself and her rights, took precedence in all the ceremonies. While at the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s tomb, a commotion happened between Ci&#x27;an and Cixi. Ci&#x27;an, as the primary wife of the deceased emperor, took the central position. She told Cixi to stand on the right and reminded her that she was only a concubine while the Xianfeng Emperor was still living. The vacant spot on the left was symbolically reserved for the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s first consort, Empress Xiaodexian. It is not known how Cixi reacted to this incident.

====Death====
On 8 April 1881, while attending an imperial court session, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an became ill and was escorted to her private quarters, where she died within a few hours. Her sudden death was a shock to many people. Although she was in good health, Ci&#x27;an had fallen seriously ill at least three times according to Weng Tonghe, who tutored the Guangxu Emperor. She had a history of what appeared to be strokes. In his diary, Weng Tonghe recorded the first stroke in March 1863, when Ci&#x27;an suddenly fainted and lost her ability to speak for nearly a month. Her reputation for &#x27;speaking slowly and with difficulty&#x27; during audiences may have been a consequence of her stroke. A second stroke was recorded in January 1870. The official cause of her death between 21:00 and 23:00 hours was a sudden stroke. Physicians who studied her medical records are almost certain that she died of a massive brain haemorrhage.

Thirty years after her death, rumours started spreading that she had been poisoned by Empress Dowager Cixi. However, such claims have never been substantiated and new evidence has not appeared in the many years since. Furthermore, Cixi herself had been ill to the point of being unable to serve her functions at court, making her involvement in Ci&#x27;an&#x27;s death highly unlikely.

One of the most circulated rumours is that before his death, the Xianfeng Emperor wrote a secret imperial edict and gave it to Ci&#x27;an. Apparently, the emperor foresaw that Cixi would try to overrule Ci&#x27;an and dominate the imperial court, so he wrote the edict to authorise Ci&#x27;an to have Cixi eliminated if necessary. Ci&#x27;an, believing that Cixi would not harm her, showed her the secret edict and burnt it to demonstrate her trust in her co-regent. She died under mysterious circumstances later that day.

The posthumous name given to Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, which combines the honorific names she gained during her lifetime with new names added just after her death, was:

which reads:
*&quot;&quot;Empress Xiao ² -zhen ³ Ci&#x27;an Yuqing Hejing Chengjing Yitian Zuosheng 4 Xian 5 &quot;.&quot;

This long name is still the one that can be seen on Ci&#x27;an&#x27;s tomb today. The short form of her posthumous name is:

*&quot;Empress Xiaozhenxian&quot; ().

After her death a valedictory degree was written for Ci&#x27;an which reads:

&quot;In spite of the arduous duties of the State, which have fully occupied my time, I was naturally of robust constitution and had therefore fully expected to attain to a good old age and to enjoy the Emperor&#x27;s dutiful ministrations. Yesterday, however, I was suddenly stricken with a slight illness and his Majesty thereupon commanded his physician to attend me; later his Majesty came in person to enquire as to my health. And now, most unexpectedly, I have had a most dangerous relapse. At 1900 hours this evening I became completely confused in mind and now all hope of my recovery appears to be vain. I am forty-five years of age and for close on twenty years have held the high position of a regent of the empire. Many honorific titles and ceremonies of congratulation have been bestowed upon me: what cause have I therefore to regret?&quot; 
This translation of the valedictory comes from John Bland and Edmund Backhouse&#x27;s book &quot;China Under the Empress Dowager&quot;. Another translation of the valedictory is found in &quot;Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States&quot; which contains corresponding letters between James Burrill Angell and James B. Blaine. Angell&#x27;s first letter about Ci&#x27;an was written three days after her death and received on 23 June 1881:

&quot;Sir: I have to announce that on the 8th instant, at 6PM, the Empress Dowager, commonly known as the Empress of the East Palace, in distinction from the Empress Dowager of the West Palace, died after an illness of only two days. The legations have, at the time of this writing, received no official announcement of the event. But the &quot;Peking Gazette&quot; contains two imperial rescripts concerning her death. As the mail leaves at once I cannot now inclose translation of them.

The deceased Empress is the widow of the Emperor Hsien-Fung, who reigned from 1850 to 1861. Having lost his wife just as he ascended the throne, he married the lady just deceased. She bore him no son. In 1856 one of his concubines or second wives bore him a son, who succeeded him as the Emperor Tung-Chih in 1861. At the death of Hsien-Fung, his wife, the woman who just died, was, of course, the Empress Dowager. But by decree of the new Emperor, Tung-Chih, his mother was also raised to the honor of Empress Dowager. So there have been two Empresses Dowager since 1861. The present Emperor, Kwang-Hsü, who came to the throne in 1874, is the cousin of Tung-Chih and nephew of the surviving Empress Dowager. The two Empresses, it is thought, have played a considerable part in the conduct of affairs. The deceased Empress has been reputed to be of a pacific spirit, and friendly to Prince Kung. The surviving Empress has been thought to take a more active part in shaping the policy of the empire. She has been so ill for months that her death has been daily expected, and several times reported in the streets. But the Empress of the East Palace has not been ill, until she was seized last week with her fatal disease. I think she was about forty-five years of age. It is feared that her sudden death may have an unfavorable and possibly fatal effect on the surviving Empress in her condition of weakness.

It is impossible to say yet whether the death of the Empress of the East Palace will lead to any important political results. Should the other Empress also die, it is extremely possible that important consequences would follow, though no one can predict what they would be. Vague rumors of plottings in the palace are afloat, but as yet they are but rumors and not worth repeating. 
On 30 April 1881, Angell wrote a second letter about Ci&#x27;an, to Blaine. It contained a translation of an imperial edict sent by Prince Kung and a farewell mandate which appeared in the &quot;Peking Gazette&quot;. The imperial edict reads as follows:

Since Our entrance upon the inheritance of the great dynastic line, looking upward, We have been the recipient of fostering care and unbounded maternal affection from the departed Empress, T&#x27;zu-an Twan-Yu-K&#x27;ang-Ching-Chao-Ho-Chwang-Ching.

During the seven years which have elapsed since Our accession to the Throne, as, anticipating Her wishes, with respectable care we provided for her wants. Our efforts have been greatly rewarded by the joyous and happy contentment which She has always manifested.

The robust health which we seemed to recognize in Her appearance and movements, and Her zeal for state affairs at all times, were a source of great joy and comfort to our mind, and we hoped that Her life would be prolonged a hundred years, that She might long continue in the enjoyment of happiness. On the 7th instant the benign body was suddenly taken ill. A decoction of medicine was immediately given to dissipate the ailment and restore health, but unexpectedly on the following day the sickness rapidly grew dangerous, respiration was hindered by copious generation of phlegm, and the case became urgent and desperate. Between the hours of 7 and 9PM the benign spirit rode in the fairy chariot and ascended to the remote regions. Prostrate upon the earth, with outstretched arms, we raised our cry to Heaven, bewailing our overwhelming grief.

We have reverently received the dying behest of the departed Empress that the mourning garb be laid aside after twenty-seven days. Our feelings would indeed be hard to reconcile if we should do this. We shall therefore observe deep mourning for one hundred days, and half mourning for the full term of twenty-seven months, to manifest in some degree our sincere sorrow at this bereavement. The departed Empress having also admonished us to endeavor to control our sorrow and give due regard to the importance of state affairs so as to console the Empress Dowager, &quot;T&#x27;zu-hsi Twan-Yü-Kang-Yi-Chao-Yü-Chwang-Ch&#x27;eng,&quot; in return for Her care in educating and nurturing us, we dare not disregard this advice, and, in respectful obedience to the bequaethed command, we shall endeavor to check and restrain our sorrow.

Let the Prince of T&#x27;un, Yi Tsung; the Prince of Kung, Yi Hsin; the Beile, Yi-Kwang; the minister of the presence, Ching Shou; the grand secretary, Pao-Chun; the assistant great secretary and president, Ling-Kuei; and the presidents, Ngen-Ch&#x27;eng and Ong-Fung-Ho, with respectful care attend to the rites and ceremonies to be observed in the present mourning.[Let them carefully examine the prescriptions of the old canon and memorialize us as to the appropriate rites and ceremonies to be observed. Let this decree be promulgated throughout the Empire for the information of all.]

Respect this. 


Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an was interred amidst the Eastern Qing tombs, east of Beijing. She was denied burial next to her husband in the Ding Mausoleum. Instead she was interred in the Eastern Ding Mausoleum () tomb complex, along with Empress Dowager Cixi. More precisely, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an lies in the Puxiangyu Eastern Ding Mausoleum (), while Cixi built herself the much larger Putuoyu Eastern Ding Mausoleum (). The Ding Mausoleum (literally &quot;tomb of quietude&quot;) is the tomb of the Xianfeng Emperor and is located west of the Dingdongling. The vale of Putuo owes its name to Mount Putuo, at the foot of which the Eastern Ding Mausoleum is located.

==Appraisal==
A popular view of Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an is that she was a highly respectable person, always quiet, never hot-tempered, and that she treated everybody very well and was highly respected by the Xianfeng Emperor. Both the Tongzhi and Guangxu Emperors preferred Ci&#x27;an above Cixi. Her good-hearted personality was no match for Empress Dowager Cixi, who managed to sideline the naive and candid Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an. This is still the popular view in China, the image of a quiet Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an perhaps stemming from the meaning of her honorific name.

However, some historians have painted a very different reality, mainly that of a self-indulgent and idle Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, who did not care as much for government and hard work as she cared for the pleasures and sweet life inside the Forbidden City. Empress Dowager Cixi, on the other hand, was a shrewd and intelligent woman who was ready to make sacrifices and work hard in order to obtain supreme power, and who faced the complex problems that were besetting China at the time. As often, the reality may lie in between these two extremes and some even claim that Ci&#x27;an is said to have exhibited temper and willpower. The popular view of Ci&#x27;an being a nice simple girl was exaggerated by the reformer Kang Youwei and biographers John Bland and Edmund Backhouse, to build up the contrast between her and Cixi. There are no documented meetings between any foreigner and Ci&#x27;an, unlike Cixi, who met many foreigners after 1900.

Katherine Carl, who spent nine months with Empress Dowager Cixi in 1903, described Ci&#x27;an, even though she never met her, as follows: Ci&#x27;an was known as the &quot;Literary Empress&quot;. While Cixi handled all state affairs, Ci&#x27;an gave herself up to literary pursuits and led the life of a student. She was a woman of such fine literary ability that she herself sometimes examined the essays of the aspirants for the highest literary honours at the University of Beijing. She was also a writer of distinction. Ci&#x27;an and Cixi lived amicably together, appreciated each other&#x27;s qualities, and are said to have had a sincere affection for each other, which never weakened during the whole of their long association. Their amicable relation ended with the death of Ci&#x27;an in 1881.

Another view of Ci&#x27;an was written by Lim Boon Keng. The beautiful Yehenara, like the Jew Hagar, was the handmaid who was to bear a son for her master. Ci&#x27;an appears to have been like Sarah, who in her anxiety to make up for her own sterility, encouraged her husband to show his favour to his maid. Perhaps the Xianfeng Emperor did not need encouragement, but Ci&#x27;an took great interest in the concubine as the prospective mother of the emperor&#x27;s son and heir. Cixi was quick-tempered and probably jealous of the empress. Just before the birth of the Tongzhi Emperor, Cixi was nearly demoted in rank for her bad temper and insolence. Ci&#x27;an intervened on her behalf. In contrast to Hagar, Cixi did not openly despise her mistress. She was as tame as a lamb, and for many years they lived on terms of friendship.

<doc id="416121" wikidata="Q372672" url="?curid=416121" title="Landing of the Granma">
<text>Granma is a yacht that was used to transport 82 fighters of the Cuban Revolution from Mexico to Cuba in November 1956 to overthrow the regime of Fulgencio Batista. The 60-foot (18 m) diesel-powered vessel was built in 1943 by Wheeler Shipbuilding of Brooklyn, New York, as a light armored target practice boat, US Navy C-1994, and modified postwar to accommodate 12 people. &quot;Granma&quot;, in English, is an affectionate term for a grandmother; the yacht is said to have been named for the previous owner&#x27;s grandmother.

==Background==
===Exile of Moncada attackers===

In 1953, beginning their first attack against the Batista government, Fidel Castro gathered 160 fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on two military installations. On 26 July 1953, the rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo, only to be defeated decisively by the far more numerous government soldiers. It was hoped that the staged attack would initiate a nationwide revolt against Batista&#x27;s government. After an hour of fighting most of the rebels and their commander fled to the mountains. The exact number of rebels killed in the battle is debatable; however, in his autobiography, Fidel Castro wrote that six were killed during the fighting, and an additional 55 were executed after being captured by the Batista government. Due to the government&#x27;s large number of men, Hunt revised the number to about 60 members taking the opportunity to flee to the mountains along with Castro. Among the dead was Abel Santamaría, Castro&#x27;s second-in-command, who was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the same day as the attack.

Numerous important revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured soon afterwards. During a political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his defense, ending with the words &quot;Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me.&quot; Castro&#x27;s defense was based on nationalism, representation and beneficial programs for the non-elite Cubans, justice for the Cuban community, and his patriotism. Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the prison Presidio Modelo, located on Isla de Pinos, while Raúl was sentenced to 13 years. However, in 1955, yielding to political considerations, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers. Fidel&#x27;s Jesuit childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Raúl in the release. Fidel Castro left Cuba for exile in Mexico.

===Conception===
In Mexico, Fidel Castro soon met with Spanish Civil War veteran Alberto Bayo. Castro informed Bayo he had a plan to invade Cuba but had no money for weapons or a single volunteered soldier. Despite the lack of resources Bayo decided to assist Castro&#x27;s plan because giving military advice would not cost him anything. With time Fidel would be joined by his brother Raúl Castro, and his old comrade Antonio &quot;Ñico&quot; López. Lopez would bring Raúl Castro to a nearby hospital where an exiled Che Guevara was working as a doctor. Guevara, who had met Lopez previously in Guatemala was invited to meet with Fidel Castro by Lopez. The Castro brothers, Lopez, and Guevara were to be the first volunteers for the expedition. On the evening of July 8, 1954 Guevara and Fidel Castro met in the home of Maria Antonia Gonzalez. The apartment later became a headquarters for the rebels. Castro realised he had little money for his plans and in October travelled to New Jersey and Miami to raise money from Cuban exiles for his invasion.

===Preparations===

The yacht was purchased on October 10, 1956, for MX$50,000 (US$4,000 in 1956) from the United States–based Schuylkill Products Company, Inc., by a Mexican citizen—said to be Mexico City gun dealer Antonio &quot;The Friend&quot; del Conde—secretly representing Fidel Castro.
The builder, Wheeler Shipbuiding, then of Brooklyn, New York, now of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, also built Ernest Hemmingway&#x27;s boat &quot;Pilar&quot;. It is still unknown who removed the light armor and expanded the cabin postwar to convert the navy training boat into a civilian yacht.
Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement had attempted to purchase a Catalina flying boat maritime aircraft, or a US naval crash rescue boat for the purpose of crossing the Gulf of Mexico to Cuba, but their efforts had been thwarted by lack of funds. The money to purchase &quot;Granma&quot; had been raised in the US state of Florida by former President of Cuba Carlos Prío Socarrás and Teresa Casuso Morín.

Soon after midnight on November 25, 1956, in the Mexican port of Tuxpan, Veracruz, &quot;Granma&quot; was boarded surreptitiously by 82 members of the 26th of July Movement including their commander, Fidel Castro, his brother, Raúl Castro, Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos. The group—who later came to be known collectively as &quot;los expedicionarios del yate Granma&quot; (the &quot;Granma&quot; yacht expeditioners)—then set out from Tuxpan at 2 a.m. After a series of vicissitudes and misadventures, including diminishing supplies, sea-sickness, and the near-foundering of their heavily laden and leaking craft, they disembarked on December 2 on the Playa Las Coloradas, in the municipality of Niquero, in modern Granma Province (named for the vessel), formerly part of the larger Oriente Province. &quot;Granma&quot; was piloted by Norberto Collado Abreu, a World War II Cuban Navy veteran and ally of Castro. The location was chosen to emulate the voyage of national hero José Martí, who had landed in the same region 61 years earlier during the wars of independence from Spanish colonial rule.

A rebellion organized by the 26th of July movement and planned by Haydée Santamaría, Celia Sánchez, and Frank País occurred in Santiago de Cuba. The rebellion happened on November 30 and was meant to take place in conjunction with the landing of the Granma, which was expected to land in Cuba five days after departing from Mexico. A reception party was assigned to wait for the rebels during the uprising at the lighthouse at Cabo Cruz, with trucks and 100 men. After this, the plan was that they would raid the towns of Niquero and Manzanillo together, after which they would escape into the Sierra Maestra to conduct guerilla warfare. However, due to choppy weather, the Granma had landed two days late on December 2, and as a result, the supporting uprising was left isolated and was quickly destroyed. As a result of this, the rebels had lost the element of surprise, and the military was put on high alert in the region.

===Granma landing===

We reached solid ground, lost, stumbling along like so many shadows or ghosts marching in response to some obscure psychic impulse. We had been through seven days of constant hunger and sickness during the sea crossing, topped by three still more terrible days on land. Exactly 10 days after our departure from Mexico, during the early morning hours of December 5, following a night-long march interrupted by fainting and frequent rest periods, we reached a spot paradoxically known as Alegría de Pío (Rejoicing of the Pious). – Che Guevara
The Granma had approached the Playa las Coloradas in the early morning of December 2, 1956. Trying to spot the Cabo Cruz lighthouse, the navigator had fallen overboard, after which he had to be rescued. With the night quickly departing, Fidel ordered for the ship to land at the nearest point of land. However, they had crashed into a sandbar, a mile short of the intended point of rendezvous, in a mangrove swamp. The reception party had departed from the lighthouse the night prior after waiting for two days. They departed the boat and were forced to leave much of their food, ammunition and medicine behind, landing onto shore in the mid-morning. During the landing, they had been spotted by the Cuban coast guard, after which news of the landing was relayed to the armed forces.

After splitting into two groups upon reaching dry land, the rebels were forced to gradually abandon more equipment as they navigated the bush. During this period, Batista predicted correctly that the landing would occur, and his troops were ready. Consequentially, the landing party was bombarded by helicopters and airplanes soon after landing. Since the terrain on the coastline provided little cover, the party was an easy target. After two days on December 4, the separate groups had found each other and trekked further inland in the direction of the Sierra Maestra with the help of a local peasant guide.

=== Ambush at Alegría de Pío ===

Shortly after midnight on December 5, the rebel column had halted to rest for the night at a sugarcane field, where they had feasted on stalks of cane, leaving behind their presence to enemy forces. During this time, their guide had abandoned them, telling nearby soldiers of the presence and location of the rebels. Passing by the edge of a cane field, the rebels were then ambushed in the afternoon at Alegría de Pío. Caught by surprise, the rebels panicked and milled around as their organization and cohesion were destroyed. Fidel ordered his men to follow him into the forests to escape, however, in the midst of the fighting, many abandoned their equipment, and others who were paralyzed by shock and terror remained where they were.

Many casualties ensued, most of them during battle at further inland. The survivors continued to the foot of Pico Turquino in the Sierra Maestra to perform guerilla warfare.

Initially, Batista did not know who exactly were among the casualties, and international media widely reported that Fidel had died. This was, however, not the case. Of the 82, about 21 had survived. According to the most credible version, the survivors were Fidel, Raúl, Guevara, Armando Rodríguez, , Ramiro Valdés, Universo Sánchez, Efigenio Ameijeiras, René Rodríguez, Camilo Cienfuegos, Juan Almeida Bosque, Calixto García, Calixto Morales, Reinaldo Benítez, Julio Díaz, Luis Crespo Cabrera, Rafael Chao, , José Morán, Carlos Bermúdez, and Fransisco González. All others had been either killed, captured, or left behind.

==Legacy==

Soon after the revolutionary forces triumphed on January 1, 1959, the cabin cruiser was transferred to Havana Bay. Norberto Collado Abreu, who had served as main helmsman for the 1956 voyage, received the job of guarding and preserving the yacht.

Since 1976, the yacht has been displayed permanently in a glass enclosure at the Memorial &quot;Granma&quot; adjacent to the Museum of the Revolution in Havana. A portion of old Oriente Province, where the expedition made landfall, was renamed Granma Province in honor of the vessel. UNESCO has declared the Landing of the Granma National Park—established at the location (Playa Las Coloradas)—a World Heritage Site for its natural habitat.

The Cuban government celebrates December 2 as the Day of the Cuban Armed Forces, and a replica has also been paraded at state functions to commemorate the original voyage. In further tribute, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party has been named &quot;Granma&quot;. The name of the vessel became a symbol for Cuban communism.

<text>In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g., an if–then–else structure) will go before this is known definitively. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high performance in many modern pipelined microprocessor architectures.

Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump instruction. A conditional jump can either be &quot;taken&quot; and jump to a different place in program memory, or it can be &quot;not taken&quot; and continue execution immediately after the conditional jump. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction pipeline (see fig. 1).

Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline. The branch predictor attempts to avoid this waste of time by trying to guess whether the conditional jump is most likely to be taken or not taken. The branch that is guessed to be the most likely is then fetched and speculatively executed. If it is later detected that the guess was wrong, then the speculatively executed or partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay.

The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a more advanced branch predictor.

The first time a conditional jump instruction is encountered, there is not much information to base a prediction on. But the branch predictor keeps records of whether branches are taken or not taken. When it encounters a conditional jump that has been seen several times before, then it can base the prediction on the history. The branch predictor may, for example, recognize that the conditional jump is taken more often than not, or that it is taken every second time.

Branch prediction is not the same as branch target prediction. Branch prediction attempts to guess whether a conditional jump will be taken or not. Branch target prediction attempts to guess the target of a taken conditional or unconditional jump before it is computed by decoding and executing the instruction itself. Branch prediction and branch target prediction are often combined into the same circuitry.

==Implementation==

===Static branch prediction===
Static prediction is the simplest branch prediction technique because it does not rely on information about the dynamic history of code executing. Instead, it predicts the outcome of a branch based solely on the branch instruction.

The early implementations of SPARC and MIPS (two of the first commercial RISC architectures) used single-direction static branch prediction: they always predict that a conditional jump will not be taken, so they always fetch the next sequential instruction. Only when the branch or jump is evaluated and found to be taken, does the instruction pointer get set to a non-sequential address.

Both CPUs evaluate branches in the decode stage and have a single cycle instruction fetch. As a result, the branch target recurrence is two cycles long, and the machine always fetches the instruction immediately after any taken branch. Both architectures define branch delay slots in order to utilize these fetched instructions.

A more advanced form of static prediction presumes that backward branches will be taken and that forward branches will not. A backward branch is one that has a target address that is lower than its own address. This technique can help with prediction accuracy of loops, which are usually backward-pointing branches, and are taken more often than not taken.

Some processors allow branch prediction hints to be inserted into the code to tell whether the static prediction should be taken or not taken. The Intel Pentium 4 accepts branch prediction hints, but this feature was abandoned in later Intel processors.

Static prediction is used as a fall-back technique in some processors with dynamic branch prediction when dynamic predictors do not have sufficient information to use. Both the Motorola MPC7450 (G4e) and the Intel Pentium 4 use this technique as a fall-back.

In static prediction, all decisions are made at compile time, before the execution of the program.

===Dynamic branch prediction===
Dynamic branch prediction uses information about taken or not taken branches gathered at run-time to predict the outcome of a branch.

===Random branch prediction===
Using a random or pseudorandom bit (a pure guess) would guarantee every branch a 50% correct prediction rate, which cannot be improved (or worsened) by reordering instructions. (With the simplest static prediction of &quot;assume take&quot;, compilers can reorder instructions to get better than 50% correct prediction.) Also, it would make timing [much more] nondeterministic.

===Next line prediction===
Some superscalar processors (MIPS R8000, Alpha 21264, and Alpha 21464 (EV8)) fetch each line of instructions with a pointer to the next line. This next-line predictor handles branch target prediction as well as branch direction prediction.

When a next-line predictor points to aligned groups of 2, 4, or 8 instructions, the branch target will usually not be the first instruction fetched, and so the initial instructions fetched are wasted. Assuming for simplicity, a uniform distribution of branch targets, 0.5, 1.5, and 3.5 instructions fetched are discarded, respectively.

Since the branch itself will generally not be the last instruction in an aligned group, instructions after the taken branch (or its delay slot) will be discarded. Once again, assuming a uniform distribution of branch instruction placements, 0.5, 1.5, and 3.5 instructions fetched are discarded.

The discarded instructions at the branch and destination lines add up to nearly a complete fetch cycle, even for a single-cycle next-line predictor.

===One-level branch prediction===
====Saturating counter====
A 1-bit saturating counter (essentially a flip-flop) records the last outcome of the branch. This is the most simple version of dynamic branch predictor possible, although it is not very accurate.

A 2-bit saturating counter is a state machine with four states:
* Strongly not taken
* Weakly not taken
* Weakly taken
* Strongly taken

When a branch is evaluated, the corresponding state machine is updated. Branches evaluated as not taken change the state toward strongly not taken, and branches evaluated as taken change the state toward strongly taken. The advantage of the two-bit counter scheme over a one-bit scheme is that a conditional jump has to deviate twice from what it has done most in the past before the prediction changes. For example, a loop-closing conditional jump is mispredicted once rather than twice.

The original, non-MMX Intel Pentium processor uses a saturating counter, though with an imperfect implementation.

On the SPEC&#x27;89 benchmarks, very large bimodal predictors saturate at 93.5% correct, once every branch maps to a unique counter.

The predictor table is indexed with the instruction address bits, so that the processor can fetch a prediction for every instruction before the instruction is decoded.

===Two-level predictor===
The Two-Level Branch Predictor, also referred to as Correlation-Based Branch Predictor, uses a two-dimensional table of counters, also called &quot;Pattern History Table&quot;. The table entries are two-bit counters.

====Two-level adaptive predictor====
If an codice_1 statement is executed three times, the decision made on the third execution might depend upon whether the previous two were taken or not. In such scenarios, a two-level adaptive predictor works more efficiently than a saturation counter. Conditional jumps that are taken every second time or have some other regularly recurring pattern are not predicted well by the saturating counter. A two-level adaptive predictor remembers the history of the last n occurrences of the branch and uses one saturating counter for each of the possible 2n history patterns. This method is illustrated in figure 3.

Consider the example of n = 2. This means that the last two occurrences of the branch are stored in a two-bit shift register. This branch history register can have four different binary values, 00, 01, 10, and 11, where zero means &quot;not taken&quot; and one means &quot;taken&quot;. A pattern history table contains four entries per branch, one for each of the 22 = 4 possible branch histories, and each entry in the table contains a two-bit saturating counter of the same type as in figure 2 for each branch. The branch history register is used for choosing which of the four saturating counters to use. If the history is 00, then the first counter is used; if the history is 11, then the last of the four counters is used.

Assume, for example, that a conditional jump is taken every third time. The branch sequence is 001001001... In this case, entry number 00 in the pattern history table will go to state &quot;strongly taken&quot;, indicating that after two zeroes comes a one. Entry number 01 will go to state &quot;strongly not taken&quot;, indicating that after 01 comes a zero. The same is the case with entry number 10, while entry number 11 is never used because there are never two consecutive ones.

The general rule for a two-level adaptive predictor with an n-bit history is that it can predict any repetitive sequence with any period if all n-bit sub-sequences are different.

The advantage of the two-level adaptive predictor is that it can quickly learn to predict an arbitrary repetitive pattern. This method was invented by T.-Y. Yeh and Yale Patt at the University of Michigan. Since the initial publication in 1991, this method has become very popular. Variants of this prediction method are used in most modern microprocessors.

====Two-level neural predictor====
A two-level branch predictor where the second level is replaced with a neural network has been proposed.

===Local branch prediction===
A local branch predictor has a separate history buffer for each conditional jump instruction. It may use a two-level adaptive predictor. The history buffer is separate for each conditional jump instruction, while the pattern history table may be separate as well or it may be shared between all conditional jumps.

The Intel Pentium MMX, Pentium II, and Pentium III have local branch predictors with a local 4-bit history and a local pattern history table with 16 entries for each conditional jump.

On the SPEC&#x27;89 benchmarks, very large local predictors saturate at 97.1% correct.

===Global branch prediction===
A global branch predictor does not keep a separate history record for each conditional jump. Instead it keeps a shared history of all conditional jumps. The advantage of a shared history is that any correlation between different conditional jumps is part of making the predictions. The disadvantage is that the history is diluted by irrelevant information if the different conditional jumps are uncorrelated, and that the history buffer may not include any bits from the same branch if there are many other branches in between. It may use a two-level adaptive predictor.

This scheme is better than the saturating counter scheme only for large table sizes, and it is rarely as good as local prediction. The history buffer must be longer in order to make a good prediction. The size of the pattern history table grows exponentially with the size of the history buffer. Hence, the big pattern history table must be shared among all conditional jumps.

A two-level adaptive predictor with globally shared history buffer and pattern history table is called a &quot;gshare&quot; predictor if it xors the global history and branch PC, and &quot;gselect&quot; if it concatenates them. Global branch prediction is used in AMD processors, and in Intel Pentium M, Core, Core 2, and Silvermont-based Atom processors.

===Alloyed branch prediction===
An alloyed branch predictor combines the local and global prediction principles by concatenating local and global branch histories, possibly with some bits from the program counter as well. Tests indicate that the VIA Nano processor may be using this technique.

===Agree predictor===
An agree predictor is a two-level adaptive predictor with globally shared history buffer and pattern history table, and an additional local saturating counter. The outputs of the local and the global predictors are XORed with each other to give the final prediction. The purpose is to reduce contentions in the pattern history table where two branches with opposite prediction happen to share the same entry in the pattern history table.

===Hybrid predictor===
A hybrid predictor, also called combined predictor, implements more than one prediction mechanism. The final prediction is based either on a meta-predictor that remembers which of the predictors has made the best predictions in the past, or a majority vote function based on an odd number of different predictors.

Scott McFarling proposed combined branch prediction in his 1993 paper.

On the SPEC&#x27;89 benchmarks, such a predictor is about as good as the local predictor.

Predictors like gshare use multiple table entries to track the behavior of any particular branch. This multiplication of entries makes it much more likely that two branches will map to the same table entry (a situation called aliasing), which in turn makes it much more likely that prediction accuracy will suffer for those branches. Once you have multiple predictors, it is beneficial to arrange that each predictor will have different aliasing patterns, so that it is more likely that at least one predictor will have no aliasing. Combined predictors with different indexing functions for the different predictors are called &quot;gskew&quot; predictors, and are analogous to skewed associative caches used for data and instruction caching.

===Loop predictor===
A conditional jump that controls a loop is best predicted with a special loop predictor. A conditional jump in the bottom of a loop that repeats N times will be taken N-1 times and then not taken once. If the conditional jump is placed at the top of the loop, it will be not taken N-1 times and then taken once. A conditional jump that goes many times one way and then the other way once is detected as having loop behavior. Such a conditional jump can be predicted easily with a simple counter. A loop predictor is part of a hybrid predictor where a meta-predictor detects whether the conditional jump has loop behavior.

===Indirect branch predictor===
An indirect jump instruction can choose among more than two branches. Some processors have specialized indirect branch predictors. Newer processors from Intel and AMD can predict indirect branches by using a two-level adaptive predictor. This kind of instruction contributes more than one bit to the history buffer. The zEC12 and later z/Architecture processors from IBM support a instruction that can preload the branch predictor entry for a given instruction with a branch target address constructed by adding the contents of a general-purpose register to an immediate displacement value.

Processors without this mechanism will simply predict an indirect jump to go to the same target as it did last time.

===Prediction of function returns===
A function will normally return to where it is called from. The return instruction is an indirect jump that reads its target address from the call stack. Many microprocessors have a separate prediction mechanism for return instructions. This mechanism is based on a so-called &quot;return stack buffer&quot;, which is a local mirror of the call stack. The size of the return stack buffer is typically 4–16 entries.

===Overriding branch prediction===
The trade-off between fast branch prediction and good branch prediction is sometimes dealt with by having two branch predictors. The first branch predictor is fast and simple. The second branch predictor, which is slower, more complicated, and with bigger tables, will override a possibly wrong prediction made by the first predictor.

The Alpha 21264 and Alpha EV8 microprocessors used a fast single-cycle next-line predictor to handle the branch target recurrence and provide a simple and fast branch prediction. Because the next-line predictor is so inaccurate, and the branch resolution recurrence takes so long, both cores have two-cycle secondary branch predictors that can override the prediction of the next-line predictor at the cost of a single lost fetch cycle.

The Intel Core i7 has two branch target buffers and possibly two or more branch predictors.

===Neural branch prediction===
Machine learning for branch prediction using LVQ and multi-layer perceptrons, called &quot;neural branch prediction&quot;, was proposed by Lucian Vintan (Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu).
One year later he developed the perceptron branch predictor.
The neural branch predictor research was developed much further by Daniel Jimenez.
In 2001, the first perceptron predictor was presented that was feasible to implement in hardware. The first commercial implementation of a perceptron branch predictor was in AMD&#x27;s Piledriver microarchitecture.

The main advantage of the neural predictor is its ability to exploit long histories while requiring only linear resource growth. Classical predictors require exponential resource growth. Jimenez reports a global improvement of 5.7% over a McFarling-style hybrid predictor. He also used a gshare/perceptron overriding hybrid predictors.

The main disadvantage of the perceptron predictor is its high latency. Even after taking advantage of high-speed arithmetic tricks, the computation latency is relatively high compared to the clock period of many modern microarchitectures. In order to reduce the prediction latency, Jimenez proposed in 2003 the &quot;fast-path neural predictor&quot;, where the perceptron predictor chooses its weights according to the current branch&#x27;s path, rather than according to the branch&#x27;s PC. Many other researchers developed this concept (A. Seznec, M. Monchiero, D. Tarjan &amp; K. Skadron, V. Desmet, Akkary et al., K. Aasaraai, Michael Black, etc.).

Most of the state-of-the-art branch predictors are using a perceptron predictor (see Intel&#x27;s &quot;Championship Branch Prediction Competition&quot;). Intel already implements this idea in one of the IA-64&#x27;s simulators (2003).

The AMD Ryzen multi-core processor&#x27;s Infinity Fabric and the Samsung Exynos processor include a perceptron-based neural branch predictor.

==History==
The IBM 7030 Stretch, designed in the late 1950s, pre-executes all unconditional branches and any conditional branches that depended on the index registers. For other conditional branches, the first two production models implemented predict untaken; subsequent models were changed to implement predictions based on the current values of the indicator bits (corresponding to today&#x27;s condition codes). The Stretch designers had considered static hint bits in the branch instructions early in the project but decided against them. Misprediction recovery was provided by the lookahead unit on Stretch, and part of Stretch&#x27;s reputation for less-than-stellar performance was blamed on the time required for misprediction recovery. Subsequent IBM large computer designs did not use branch prediction with speculative execution until the IBM 3090 in 1985.

Two-bit predictors were introduced by Tom McWilliams and Curt Widdoes in 1977 for the Lawrence Livermore National Lab S-1 supercomputer and independently by Jim Smith in 1979 at CDC.

Microprogrammed processors, popular from the 1960s to the 1980s and beyond, took multiple cycles per instruction, and generally did not require branch prediction. However, in addition to the IBM 3090, there are several other examples of microprogrammed designs that incorporated branch prediction.

The Burroughs B4900, a microprogrammed COBOL machine released around 1982, was pipelined and used branch prediction. The B4900 branch prediction history state is stored back into the in-memory instructions during program execution. The B4900 implements 4-state branch prediction by using 4 semantically equivalent branch opcodes to represent each branch operator type. The opcode used indicated the history of that particular branch instruction. If the hardware determines that the branch prediction state of a particular branch needs to be updated, it rewrites the opcode with the semantically equivalent opcode that hinted the proper history. This scheme obtains a 93% hit rate. and others were granted on this scheme.

The DEC VAX 9000, announced in 1989, is both microprogrammed and pipelined, and performs branch prediction.

The first commercial RISC processors, the MIPS R2000 and R3000 and the earlier SPARC processors, do only trivial &quot;not-taken&quot; branch prediction. Because they use branch delay slots, fetched just one instruction per cycle, and execute in-order, there is no performance loss. The later R4000 uses the same trivial &quot;not-taken&quot; branch prediction, and loses two cycles to each taken branch because the branch resolution recurrence is four cycles long.

Branch prediction became more important with the introduction of pipelined superscalar processors like the Intel Pentium, DEC Alpha 21064, the MIPS R8000, and the IBM POWER series. These processors all rely on one-bit or simple bimodal predictors.

The DEC Alpha 21264 (EV6) uses a next-line predictor overridden by a combined local predictor and global predictor, where the combining choice is made by a bimodal predictor.

The AMD K8 has a combined bimodal and global predictor, where the combining choice is another bimodal predictor. This processor caches the base and choice bimodal predictor counters in bits of the L2 cache otherwise used for ECC. As a result, it has effectively very large base and choice predictor tables, and parity rather than ECC on instructions in the L2 cache. The parity design is sufficient, since any instruction suffering a parity error can be invalidated and refetched from memory.

The Alpha 21464 (EV8, cancelled late in design) had a minimum branch misprediction penalty of 14 cycles. It was to use a complex but fast next-line predictor overridden by a combined bimodal and majority-voting predictor. The majority vote was between the bimodal and two gskew predictors.

In 2018 a catastrophic security vulnerability called Spectre was made public by Google&#x27;s Project Zero and other researchers. Affecting virtually all modern CPUs, the vulnerability involves priming the branch predictors so another process (or the kernel) will mispredict a branch and use secret data as an array index, evicting one of the attacker&#x27;s cache lines. The attacker can time access to their own array to find out which one, turning this CPU internal (microarchitectural) state into a value the attacker can save which has information about values they could not read directly.

<text>Santa Barbara Island (Spanish: &quot;Isla de Santa Bárbara&quot;; Tongva: &quot;Tchunashngna&quot;) is a small island of the Channel Islands archipelago in Southern California. It is protected within Channel Islands National Park, and its marine ecosystem is part of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Public passenger access to Santa Barbara Island is provided by the Island Packers ferry service.

==Geography==

The island is located about from the Palos Verdes Peninsula coast of Los Angeles County, Southern California, (near Ventura County and west of Greater Los Angeles).

With a total area of about 1 square mile (), it is the smallest of the eight Channel Islands. It is the southernmost island in the Channel Islands National Park. The highest peak on the island is Signal Hill, at .

Although closer to mainland Ventura County and Los Angeles County, the island is part of Santa Barbara County (United States Census Bureau Block 3012, Block Group 3, Census Tract 29.10). It is the only one of the four southern Channel Islands included in the Channel Islands National Park, which also encompasses all four northern islands. As of the 2000 census the island is uninhabited and has a total land area of .

The island is so small that it cannot usually be seen from the mainland, except on clear days (usually in winter). At sunset the island is a backlit silhouette.

== Geology ==
While the island is not a volcano, it is composed primarily of Miocene volcanic rocks (basalt) interbedded with marine sediments.

The steep wave-cut cliffs of its shoreline indicate that this is one of the younger Channel Islands. It exhibits at least six marine terraces; evidence of repeated tectonic uplift and subsidence (so called porpoising). Arch Point, on the north-east shore of the island is a arch caused by wave erosion of fault weakened rock.

Offshore, there are two named rocks: Sutil Island off the southwest end () and Shag Rock off the northerly shore () .

==History==

Native American peoples, probably the Chumash and Tongva, occupied Santa Barbara Island periodically for millennia. Archaeological sites dating to as much as 4,000 years ago have been documented on the island, which may have served as a stopover or refuge point for voyagers between the mainland and the other Channel Islands.

The island was named by Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno, who sighted the island on 4 December 1602, the feast day dedicated to Saint Barbara. The United States Coast Survey surveyed the island in the 1850s. Squatting fishermen and seal hunters occupied the island, including H. Bay Webster near Webster Point, until the federal government leased the island to J.G. Howland in July 1909 for a period of five years. Alvin Hyder assumed the next five-year lease. From 1916 onwards, the island was occupied by the Hyder brothers, Alvin, Clarence and Cleve, with their families. They raised sheep until departing the island in 1922. The only other individuals to lease the island, before it became part of the national monument in 1938, were by Arthur McLelland and Harry Cupit from 1929 to 1932.

In 1852, Charles Melville Scammon, in the brig &quot;Mary Helen&quot;, hunted northern elephant seals and sea lions on Santa Barbara Island. In December 1934, the steam-schooner &quot;California&quot; spent a week anchored off the island, processing blue, fin, and sperm whales caught by her two steam-driven whale catchers &quot;Hawk&quot; and &quot;Port Saunders&quot;.

The United States Lighthouse Board erected a beacon on the northwest side of the island in 1928, followed by the addition of a second beacon on the southwest corner in 1934. The United States Coast Guard took over servicing, and replaced the northwest tower with a steel tower, solar-powered, in 1980. From 1942 until 1946, the United States Navy built a Coastal Lookout Station on the island, and in the 1960s they built a photo-tracking station, but had left the island by the mid-1960s.

==Natural history==
===Fauna===
Santa Barbara Island is home to a large sea lion rookery and seabird nesting colonies. It is also home to the largest breeding colony for Scripps&#x27;s murrelet, a threatened seabird species. Scripps&#x27;s murrelet is listed as vulnerable because so much of its breeding takes place on such a small and isolated island.

Fourteen species of birds nest annually on the island. These include the horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, and house finch. Other birds found on the island include the brown pelican, Western gull, storm petrels, Scripps&#x27;s murrelet, Guadalupe murrelet, and cormorants. Sea lions, harbor seals, and northern elephant seals are found along the shoreline.

===Flora===
Santa Barbara Island live-forever (&quot;Dudleya traskiae&quot;) is a succulent plant endemic to the island. A variety of St. Catherine&#x27;s lace buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum giganteum&quot;), &quot;Eriogonum giganteum&quot; var. &quot;compactum&quot; or Santa Barbara Island buckwheat, is endemic to and particularly rare on Santa Barbara Island.

<doc id="416139" wikidata="Q383556" url="?curid=416139" title="San Clemente Island">
<text>San Clemente Island (Tongva: &quot;Kinkipar&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Isla de San Clemente&quot;) is the southernmost of the Channel Islands of California. It is owned and operated by the United States Navy, and is a part of Los Angeles County. It is administered by Naval Base Coronado. It is long and has of land. The 2018 census estimates 148 military and civilian personnel reside on the island. The city of San Clemente in Orange County, California is named after the island.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Geologically, the island is described as being &quot;the upper part of a tilted and gently arched northwestward-trending block of the earth&#x27;s crust that has a straight, steep northeastern slope and a more irregular and much gentler southwestern slope&quot; that is composed primarily of volcanic rock, with the northeast boundary of the island having a large fault that parallels most of the major faults on the California mainland. San Clemente Island has some of the best examples of marine terraces and has trench-like canyons, streams, periodic waterfalls, and pools of fresh water. 

Its highest point is Mount Thirst, at 1965 feet in elevation. The elevation of the island&#x27;s ridge can impact precipitation, as it can cause atmospheric moisture to condense and cause more intense precipitation. This was a factor in the intense rainstorm that hit San Diego on January 22, 2024.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers and moderate mild falls and winters with no average monthly temperature above 21 °C (69.5 °F). According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, San Clemente Island has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Ecology==
===Fauna and flora===

The San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike is an endangered species that the Navy is taking steps to protect. The San Clemente Island fox is an indigenous species. Feral goats roamed the island for centuries, reaching a population of 11,000 in 1972, when their effect on indigenous species was realized. By 1980, the population had been reduced to 4,000. The Fund for Animals blocked a plan for shooting the remaining goats in court, so the goats were removed with nets and helicopters. The San Clemente Island goat is a recognized breed of domestic goat.

The coves around the island are visited by snorkelers attracted by the abundant marine life, including sea lions, spiny lobsters, hydrocoral and kelp forests. The island is also home to the endangered San Clemente Island sage sparrow. After decades with no breeding by raptors, because of DDT contamination and Naval activity, there is now at least one breeding pair of bald eagles and more than one pair of peregrine falcons. 

Island flora includes 300 native taxa and approximately 135 non-native taxa with distribution of at least 47 of the island’s native taxa being restricted to two or more of the California Islands, 15 plant taxa being only found on San Clemente Island, and one insular endemic of the island thought to be extinct. The flora of the island includes some plant species found nowhere else in the world. These endemic species include the wildflowers San Clemente Island brodiaea, San Clemente Island triteleia, San Clemente Island woodland star, and San Clemente Island Indian paintbrush, and the shrubs San Clemente Island bushmallow and Blair&#x27;s wirelettuce. A unique subspecies of toyon, ssp. &quot;macrocarpa&quot;, also grows here, as do two rare subspecies of the royal larkspur.

Earthworms appear to have been introduced in 2008 in soil from the mainland used in a road construction project. In this earthworm-free region, the worms alter the soil and microbial communities, which allows non-native plants to change the island’s unique ecosystem and threaten biodiversity that exists there.

==History==

Archaeologists have found traces of human occupation on San Clemente Island dating back 10,000 years.

Later, inhabitants left trade materials from the northern islands and the mainland, including Coso obsidian from the California desert. It has not been established what tribe the recent inhabitants belonged to,
although the Tongva, who are well attested from Santa Catalina Island, are the most likely candidates. The Chumash, who occupied the northern Channel Islands, may have influenced the inhabitants. Evidence of battles: &#x27;the skeletons of dozens of men piled, one upon another&#x27; were also noted on San Clemente and San Nicolas.

The first European to sight the island was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542, who named it &quot;Victoria&quot;. It was renamed by Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno, who spotted it on November 23, 1602, Saint Clement&#x27;s feast day. It was used by ranchers, fishermen, and smugglers during the 19th century and into the 20th century.

In 1835, the whaleship &quot;Elbe&quot; of Poughkeepsie, New York, under Captain Josiah B. Whippey (or Whipple), hunted sperm whales as far north as &quot;St. Clements Island&quot; (San Clemente Island). The American steamship &quot;Lansing&quot;, as well as the steam-schooner &quot;California&quot;, both anchored in Pyramid Cove, on the south side of San Clemente Island, to process blue, fin and humpback whales caught by their &quot;killer boats&quot; (steam-driven whale catchers)—the former between 1926 and 1930, and the latter between 1933 and 1937. In 1935, the Norwegian factory ship &quot;Esperanza&quot; caught blue whales as far north as San Clemente Island.

==Navy base==

The US Navy acquired the island in 1934. It is the Navy&#x27;s only remaining ship-to-shore live firing range, and is the center of the integrated air/land/sea San Clemente Island Range Complex covering 2,620 nm2 (8,990 km2).

During World War II, the island was a training ground for amphibious landing craft. These small to mid-sized vessels were crucial to the island hopping that was required to attack the islands occupied by the Japanese.

It is an active sonar base and has a $21 million simulated city for commando training.

There is a US Navy rocket-test facility on San Clemente. Some Polaris-program test rockets were launched from San Clemente between 1957 and 1960. The SEALAB III project took place off San Clemente in February 1969.

The US Navy uses the island as an auxiliary naval airfield, Naval Auxiliary Landing Field San Clemente Island. The main runway 24/06 is used for carrier training by the Navy. Other branches also use this airfield, including the United States Coast Guard.

As of 2014, San Clemente is home to an auxiliary Air Force base responsible for locating Air Force fighter pilots near the California coast.

The island has United States Navy SEALs training facilities.

Seven marines and one Navy sailor were presumed to have died when their amphibious assault vehicle (AAV) sank during a training exercise off the island&#x27;s northwest coast on July 30, 2020. One of eight marines died after being rescued from the vehicle. Names of all nine people killed were identified on August 3. Fifteen Marines and a sailor were on the AAV as it returned to USS Somerset.

The USMC released a statement on 3 August 2020, saying the AAV had been found. The landing craft sank in nearly 400 feet of water.

On 27 August 2020, two soldiers were killed and three were injured when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed on San Clemente Island.

==Government and infrastructure==
The island is owned and operated by the United States Navy, and is a part of Los Angeles County. It is administered by Naval Base Coronado. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) operates the Avalon Station in Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, serving San Clemente Island.
As of 2024, Robert Garcia (California politician), (District 42) represents the island&#x27;s inhabitants in the United States House of Representatives, Lena Gonzalez in the California State Senate (District 33), and Josh Lowenthal in the California State Assembly (District 69).

<text>Robert Welch Herrick (April 21, 1868 – December 23, 1938) was a novelist who was part of a new generation of American realists. His novels deal with the turbulence of industrialized society and the turmoil it can create in sensitive, isolated people. He was also briefly acting-Governor of the United States Virgin Islands in 1935.

==Biography==
Herrick was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 21, 1868, and attended Harvard University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1890. In 1894 he married Harriett Peabody Emery with whom he had a son, Phillip Abbot Herrick, and two daughters, Alice Freeman Palmer Herrick and Harriet Peabody Herrick. He later taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1905 to 1923, he was a professor of literature at the University of Chicago, during which time he wrote thirteen novels. Among those considered to be his finest was &quot;Web of Life&quot; (1900).

Herrick was praised by William James for his frank and clear-eyed views, and his work can be compared to that of England&#x27;s George Gissing. Both writers developed themes of social discontent, the changing role of women, and the effects of social isolation. While seeing his world with a critical eye, Herrick escaped the shrill tone of muckraking writers like Upton Sinclair. His art was free of dogmatic &quot;isms&quot; and achieves its power from a melancholic fatalism. He dreaded the brutality and ignorance of the mob as much as he despised the avarice and ennui of the upper class. Herrick was suspicious of political doctrines and utopian legislation, feeling that true progress for human happiness must always lie in individuals making moral choices.

In January 1935, he was appointed as Government Secretary of the United States Virgin Islands, taking over many of the executive functions of the governor. During a political scandal involving then-Governor Paul Martin Pearson, both Pearson and his Lieutenant Governor, Lawrence William Cramer, were called away to testify before the Senate. Pearson was ultimately forced to resign and Cramer was appointed as his replacement, but he remained in Washington, D.C., until the conclusion of the hearings. During this period, Herrick was acting-Governor of the Islands, presiding over legislative sessions.

Herrick died of a heart attack on December 23, 1938 while in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, in the islands.

<doc id="416147" wikidata="Q1348353" url="?curid=416147" title="San Miguel Island">
<text>San Miguel Island (Chumash: &quot;Tuqan&quot;) is the westernmost of California&#x27;s Channel Islands, located across the Santa Barbara Channel in the Pacific Ocean, within Santa Barbara County, California. San Miguel is the sixth-largest of the eight Channel Islands at , including offshore islands and rocks. Prince Island, off the northeastern coast, measures in area. The island, at its farthest extent, is long and wide.

San Miguel Island is owned by the United States Department of the Navy and is part of Channel Islands National Park. Almost all of the island () has also been designated as an archaeological district on the National Register of Historic Places. This westernmost Channel Island receives northwesterly winds and severe weather from the open ocean. The cold and nutrient-rich water surrounding the island is home to a diverse array of sea life that is not found on the southern islands.

San Miguel Island, together with numerous small islets around it, is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Block 3010, Block Group 3, Census Tract 29.10 of Santa Barbara County, California. The island is uninhabited. The highest peak is San Miguel Hill, at .

Public passenger access to San Miguel Island is provided by the Island Packers ferry service out of the Ventura Harbor.

==History==
Colonies of ancient puffins lived on the island in the Late Pleistocene. There is also fossil evidence for a giant mouse and dwarf mammoth during the same time period.

Archaeological research has shown that San Miguel Island was first settled by humans about 13,000 years ago, when San Miguel was still part of the larger Santarosae Island that was closer to the coast and connected the northern Channel Islands when sea levels were lower near the end of the Last Glacial. Because the northern Channel Islands have not been connected to the adjacent mainland in recent geological history, the Paleo-Indians who first settled the island clearly had boats and other maritime technologies. San Miguel was occupied by the ancestors of the Chumash people for many millennia, who developed a complex and rich maritime culture based on marine fishing, hunting, and gathering. Rough seas and risky landings did not daunt the Chumash people. They called the island Tuqan in the Chumash language, and for many centuries, they built and used sophisticated canoes, called tomols, made from sewn planks caulked with asphaltum (bitumen). In tomols, they fished and hunted in island waters and participated in active trade with their neighbors on the other islands and mainland.

===Tuqan Man===

The skull and bones of a man buried between 9,800 and 10,200 years ago, as indicated by radiocarbon dating and evaluation of artifacts buried with him, were exposed by beach erosion and discovered in 2005 by University of Oregon archaeologists. They were analyzed, but it was not possible to extract the Tuqan Man&#x27;s DNA, though increasingly better testing and methods became available and were utilized. The remains were studied before their return to the island, which was delayed by resolution of tribal identification and ownership issues contingent on the precedent setting Kennewick Man case in Washington State. Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), they were restored to the claiming Chumash tribe in May, 2018, for reburial on the island.

A remaining population of a dwarf species descended from Columbian mammoths, existed on Santarosae Island when it was first visited by Paleoindians, but were extinct for perhaps three millennia prior to the death of Tuqan Man.

The midden at Daisy Cave is the oldest coastal shell midden in North America. It had an early human occupation approximately 11,500 years ago. * A metacarpal bone of a short-faced bear was found in the cave. It may have been carried from the mainland by a bird as other evidence of the bear living on the islands has not been found.

===Chumash villages===
There is evidence of the fishing prowess of inhabitants using their tomols, and which included nets, spears, rods, lines, and hooks. Two Chumash villages were active with about 100 inhabitants at the time of Cabrillo&#x27;s visit in 1542 aboard the &quot;San Miguel&quot;. San Miguel is the name George Vancouver gave the island on his 1793 chart. Vancouver adopted the name from a Spanish chart that had come into his possession.

The first European explorer to land was the explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542, who commanded three Spanish ships that spent several weeks on the island while exploring the Santa Barbara Channel and California Coast. Cabrillo died on the island and is thought by many to have been buried there. The last of the island Chumash were removed to mainland missions and towns in the 1820s, leaving San Miguel largely uninhabited until ranchers raised sheep there from 1850 to 1948. One of the ranch families that homesteaded the longest was the Lesters, a family of four that left the island at the time of Pearl Harbor due to the dangers posed by the war.

===Ranching and government ownership===
George Nidever was the highest bidder for Samuel C. Bruce&#x27;s property on the island in an auction held by the Santa Barbara County sheriff&#x27;s office in June 1863. Bruce was one of the island&#x27;s squatters. Nidever set up a sheep operation, but sold out to Hiram and Warren Mills in 1869. The Mills brothers eventually sold out to the Pacific Wool Growing Company. They sold their interest to David Fitzgibbon in 1887, who sold it back to Warren Mills, in partnership with William Waters. Warren Mills sold his interest to Elias Beckman in 1892. In 1897, Waters formed the San Miguel Island Company with Jeremiah Conroy, consisting of 3000 sheep and other livestock. However, the United States General Land Office ruled that no one had ever made claim to the island and that it remained in federal ownership. In 1911, the federal government assigned ownership of the island to United States Department of Commerce. Waters signed a 5-year lease with the federal government in 1911, which was renewed in 1916. Waters died in 1920, and the lease was renewed by his partners Robert Brooks and J. R. Moore. Brooks renewed the lease again in 1925. The United States Department of the Navy took ownership of the island from the Department of Commerce and Moore renewed his lease with the Navy in 1935. Brooks hired Herbert Lester to tenant manage the ranch in 1929, who did so with his family until his death in 1942. He is buried above Harris Point.

Despite a lighthouse on Richardson&#x27;s Rock and a bell buoy, numerous ships continued to be wrecked on the island. Of note was the &quot;SS Cuba&quot; in 1923, though passengers and gold were saved.

Ralph Hoffmann died while on an expedition to the island in 1932.

During World War II, the United States Navy stationed three sailor lookouts on the island. On July 5, 1943, a B-24 crashed into Green Mountain, killing all 12 aboard. In 1948, the navy reclaimed the island as a target in its Pacific Missile Range for guided missiles and bombing. The National Park Service initiated a visitor program run by a resident ranger in 1978, but the navy retained ownership.

Urchin diver James Robinson is believed to have been killed by a shark off Harris Point in the area known as Shark Park in 1994.

== Park Service operations ==

The National Park Service (NPS) maintains two airstrips, a ranger station and a research station on San Miguel Island. The Island is normally staffed by a ranger who enforces park laws, while also providing interpretive services for public visitors. The island also hosts scientists who study pinnipeds and manage the island fox captive breeding program that is conducted on the island. Volunteer interpretive rangers often fill in for regularly paid rangers due to budget deficits within the park.

==Fauna==
In July 2011, researchers discovered that a &quot;loomerie&quot; (breeding colony) of the California common murre (&quot;Uria aalge californica&quot;) had returned to Prince Island, an islet off San Miguel Island, for the first time since 1912. Like penguins, the football-size black-and-white seabirds use their wings to &quot;fly&quot; deep underwater, but unlike penguins, they also fly in the air. This colony disappeared nearly a century ago, likely because of egg harvesting, but now their southern range is re-established.

In the 1960s, northern fur seals (&quot;Callorhinus ursinus&quot;) successfully recolonized San Miguel Island, making the island the 3rd American (and southernmost) breeding colony. The first seals had flipper tags identifying them as being from the Pribilof or Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. By 2006, nearly 100 pups were born. Today the San Miguel colony numbers around 10,000 animals, with the pup count alone reaching 1,709 individuals by 2016, reflecting a 45% average (but highly variable) annual increase in new pups over the past 21 years. Great white sharks, which prey on the seals and sea lions, are fairly common in the waters around the island, hunted by orcas.

San Miguel Island does not receive protection from the open ocean as do the other Channel Islands. Most of the time a strong northwest wind blows across the island. These winds typically exceed and can surpass . When strong high pressure is over the mainland, the winds often cease.

Heavy fog is common on the island, especially during May and June. On warmer days the fog will burn off only to have the strong northwest wind blow in additional fog from the open ocean. On foggy days the temperature will rarely exceed . The cold and windy summer climate is much more similar to coastal locations much farther north, along the coast of Northern California than it is to Southern California. Annual rainfall is about 17 inches, mostly falling between November and March.

== Tourism ==

In May 2016, the island was reopened to tourism, following a two-year U.S. Navy survey over of marked trails and high-use areas. The survey intended to remove any dangerous ordnance in those areas. The NPS escorts all visitors and limits visitors to the established trail system. Visitors must sign an access permit and liability waiver. Access permits are available at the boat and air concession offices and at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trailhead on San Miguel Island.

Island Packers and Channel Islands Aviation have concession agreements to provide transportation to the Island. Channel Islands Aviation provides on-demand service. There is no transportation available on the island so access is by foot, private boat or kayak.

===Landing===
 are not uncommon in the Pacific between Santa Rosa Island and San Miguel Island. The Island has no pier so all public visitors arriving by sea arrive by skiff at Cuyler Harbor. Landing on the island can be challenging, as the surf can swamp the landing boat. During ideal weather, visitors are put ashore directly in front of the trail that leads into the interior of the island. When the swell is high, visitors might be placed on the beach to the east or west, depending upon conditions.

===Camping facilities===

San Miguel Island includes a campground with ten sites. Each campsite includes a picnic table, wind break and an animal-proof box. The campground includes one pit toilet. Fires are prohibited due to the high winds and the inability to extinguish them. Sturdy tents are recommended as the wind can exceed , even during the summer. It is recommended that campers tie their tents to the wind break to keep them from blowing away when not being occupied.

===Hiking===

With the exception of the trail leading from the beach in Cuyler Harbor to the campground and ranger station, hiking is restricted to ranger-led outings. Many visitors participate in the round trip hike to Point Bennett to view the thousands of elephant seals and sea lions that reside at the west end of the island during spring and summer. Another popular hike is to the island&#x27;s caliche forest.

===Water activities===
Visitors to the island are restricted to ocean access at Cuyler Harbor. This landing is well protected from the strong ocean swell that is driven from the northwest. Cuyler has a sandy beach and visitors will often find themselves sharing the beach with elephant seals. The water is generally below 60 °F (16 °C), making it cold without a wetsuit. During low tides the harbor offers a tide pool area at the east end of the beach. Sea kayaking is not recommended for the novice as high winds can develop without notice. Bathers, divers and kayakers should be aware and alert to the occurrence of adult great white sharks in these waters, some up to 18 feet in length. It is unwise to enter the water in early morning or late afternoon to early evening hours when sharks are feeding close to shore.
==In popular culture==
Portions of the 1935 film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; were filmed on the island.

&quot;LIFE&quot; Magazine featured the Lester family&#x27;s &quot;reign&quot; over the island in a 1930s photo feature. The 2012 T. C. Boyle novel &quot;San Miguel&quot; is a fictionalization of both the Waters&#x27; and Lesters&#x27; time on the island.

<text>The Ente () was the world&#x27;s first full-sized rocket-powered aircraft. It was designed by Alexander Lippisch as a sailplane and first flown under power on June 11, 1928, piloted by Fritz Stamer as part of the Opel-RAK rocket program led by Fritz von Opel and Max Valier.

During the late 1920s von Opel had made a variety of demonstrations involving rocket-powered vehicles for the Opel company. He was assisted by the pyrotechnics manufacturer Friedrich Sander and the rocketry advocate Max Valier. In March 1928 the three men visited the Wasserkuppe, a mountain which had become the center of German gliding to investigate the possibility of fitting rockets to an aircraft. There they encountered some of Lippisch&#x27;s revolutionary gliders, which because of their tail-less designs seemed suitable for adapting to rocket propulsion. Lippisch was able to demonstrate how models of his aircraft would fly with small rockets installed in them. In June von Opel, Sander, and Valier returned and bought one of his aircraft, the Ente, a canard design.

Two black powder rockets were installed, to be electrically fired by a switch in the cockpit. A counterweight system was also devised and placed under the cockpit floor which would automatically adjust the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity as the fuel of the rockets was consumed. The rockets were intended to be fired one after the other, to provide continuous thrust for as long as possible, and each had a burn time of around 30 seconds. Fritz Stamer, who had long been a test pilot for Lippisch&#x27;s designs was selected to fly the aircraft. After one false start, the aircraft took off and flew a 1,500 metre (4,900 ft) circuit of the Wasserkuppe&#x27;s landing strip.

On the second flight, the team decided to try firing both rockets together for increased thrust over a shorter period. However, rather than burning properly one of the rockets exploded, punching holes in both wings and setting the aircraft alight. Stamer was nevertheless able to bring it down from a height of around 20 metres (65 ft) before hastily abandoning the Ente, which was burned beyond any hope of repair.

The Opel RAK.1 was developed as the successor to the &quot;Ente&quot;, and was demonstrated successfully to the public in September 1929 with Fritz von Opel as pilot.

<text>The Opel RAK.1 (also known as the Opel RAK.3) was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built rocket-powered aircraft. It was designed and built by Julius Hatry under commission from Fritz von Opel, who flew it on September 30, 1929 in front of a large crowd at Rebstock airport near Frankfurt am Main. The RAK.1 plane was part of a series of rocket-powered vehicles that were developed and demonstrated within the Opel RAK program, the world&#x27;s first large-scale rocket program.

The idea to build and race a rocket-powered car as an intermediate step to realize rocket-powered aviation and even spaceflight was suggested to von Opel by Max Valier. After the World War I, Valier became highly interested in rocketry. Valier, in 1927, he was one of the co-founders of the German &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot;, or &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;, a group of later highly influential scientists who would play a major role in making rocket spaceflight a reality. As an early spaceflight advocate, Valier was more interested in publicizing rocketry than marketing Opel automobiles but came to the conclusion that building a successful rocket-powered car would achieve both goals. Von Opel confirmed his interest in realizing Valier&#x27;s proposal. On behalf of von Opel, Valier eventually contacted Friedrich Wilhelm Sander, a German pyrotechnical engineer who, in 1923, had purchased H.G. Cordes, a Bremerhaven firm famous for its manufacture of black-powder rockets used mainly for harpoons, signal devices and similar devices. Opel, Sander and Valier joined forces and combined into one entity the financing, the theoretical knowledge, and the practical capability necessary for success. Moreover, von Opel, Valier, and Sander said from the start that their experiments with cars were only a prelude to grander experiments with air- and spacecraft: They agreed on the final goal for Opel RAK of working on rocket-powered aircraft at the same time they were building their famous rocket cars, as pre-condition for the anticipated spaceflight application.

==Preparatory work on rocket-powered land vehicles==

The group went to an Opel race car, “RAK 1.” The RAK 1 demonstrator was stripped of its engine and radiator to reduce weight. To help keep the car’s wheels on the ground at expected high speeds, the group attached behind each front wheel a small, wing-like stub, set at a negative angle of attack. For propulsion, they elected to use 12 black-powder rockets, mounted in four rows of three rockets each and ignited electrically. The propellant, similar to gunpowder, burned in a subsonic deflagration wave and not in a supersonic detonation wave. A demonstration for the press on April 11, 1928, in Rüsselsheim was arranged: Opel engineer and race driver Kurt C. Volkhart developed and tested the Opel-RAK 1, a converted racing car equipped with Sander rockets instead of an internal combustion engine, which was the first rocket powered automobile. During the April 1928 experiments, piloted by Volkhart, RAK 1 reached the symbolic speed of 100 km/h in just eight seconds.

Von Opel, Sander and Valier were satisfied by RAK 1’s performance, and in particular by the attracted positive publicity for the science of rocketry, but also the Opel company. Nevertheless it was clear to the RAK program leadership, they had no plans to commercially produce rocket cars for end customers, the aim was the development and demonstration of a rocket-powered aircraft. The group continued their land projects and built RAK 2, designed by Volkhart from the ground up as a rocket car. It was far larger and more streamlined than its predecessor. The RAK 2 was powered by 24 rockets packing 264 pounds of explosives. On May 23, 1928, Fritz von Opel himself demonstrated the car, Opel RAK 2, on the Avus Speedway near Berlin. Prior to the start Professor Johann Schütte, Chairman of the Scientific Society of Aviation, and Fritz von Opel held prophetic speeches on the future of rocket-based aviation and spaceflight. After these introductory remarks, mechanics August Becker and Karl Treber then took the tarpaulin off the Opel RAK 2 and carefully pushed it to the start. Eventually the rockets were installed and connected to the ignition mechanism. Police cleared the AVUS track and von Opel drove the RAK 2 car to a record-setting speed of 238 km/h, successfully mastering the challenge of insufficient downforce from the wings for these velocities. The RAK 2 rockets were operational for a ride of circa three minutes, watched by 3,000 spectators and world media, among them Fritz Lang, director of &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;, world boxing champion Max Schmeling and many more sports and show business celebrities:

A world record for rail vehicles was reached with RAK3 on June 23, 1928, with the car attaining a top speed of 256 km/h over a 5-km stretch of straight track near Hanover. Some 20,000 spectators watched RAK 3 breaking the existing world speed record of railcars by nearly 40 km/h. The resulting international publicity after RAK2 and RAK3 demonstrations was enormous and gave the science of rocketry a major boost. A replica of the RAK 2 rocket-propelled car is on display at the Opel museum in Rüsselsheim, another one at the &quot;Deutsches Museum&quot; in Munich.

==Pioneering phase at Wasserkuppe Mountain==
After testing at Wasserkuppe, in June 1928, Fritz von Opel had purchased an Alexander Lippisch-designed sailplane, the Ente, and fitted it with rockets. Fritz Stamer was the pilot during the OPEL RAK experimentations with Lippisch&#x27;s design. Opel did not get the chance to fly it, however, as the aircraft was destroyed by an engine explosion on its second test flight. With a wingspan of just under , and a length of some , the Ente featured a canoe-like fuselage, canard surfaces, and rudders mounted outboard on a straight rectangular wing. Each of the aircraft’s two rocket engines were tightly packed with about of black powder. Designed to fire in sequence, the rockets were ignited electrically by the pilot. An automatic counterweight system was set to adjust the aircraft’s center of gravity as the rocket fuel was consumed. An elastic launching rope was used to catapult the Ente into the air. After one false start, the aircraft took off and flew a 1,500 metre (4,900 ft) circuit of the Wasserkuppe&#x27;s landing strip. On the second flight, the team decided to try firing both rockets together for increased thrust over a shorter period. Something went wrong, however, and rather than burning properly, one of the rockets exploded, punching holes in both wings and setting the aircraft afire. Stamer was nevertheless able to bring it down from a height of around 20 metres (65 ft) before hastily abandoning the Ente, which was burned beyond any hope of salvage.

==Opel RAK.1 as the world&#x27;s first dedicated rocket plane==

Despite the loss of the first rocket plane, von Opel immediately contracted with Julius Hatry for a specialized rocket aircraft. Hatry’s design for Opel was rather more elegant than the Ente. With a wingspan of 36 feet and length of 16 feet, the new aircraft Opel RAK.1 had a typical sailplane wing, under which a pod was suspended to accommodate the pilot and sixteen of Sander&#x27;s solid rocket engines each with 50 pounds of thrust. The tailplane was mounted on booms behind the wing and high out of the way of the rocket exhaust. The aircraft is sometimes referred to as the Opel-Hatry RAK.1 or Opel-Sander RAK.1 in acknowledgment of its builder or the supplier of its engines respectively. In still other references it is called the RAK.3 to distinguish it from Opel&#x27;s previous RAK.1 and RAK.2 rocket cars. As it happened, all three names, Opel, Sander, and Hatry were painted on the aircraft (with Opel’s most prominent), as was the RAK.1 designation. The first public flight came on Sept. 30, 1929. Before a large crowd assembled outside of Frankfurt, the intrepid von Opel made a successful flight of almost 3.5 km in 75 seconds, reaching an estimated top speed of around 150 km/h. RAK.1 made a hard landing, but it had made an emphatic point about rocket aviation and immensely popularized rockets as means of propulsion, causing a so called global &quot;rocket rumble&quot;. The Mannheim Museum of Technology, Technoseum, has a replica of RAK.1 as the world&#x27;s first dedicated rocket-plane on display, the execution of which Julius Hatry himself supervised. Technoseum also hosts original parts of the RAK.1 and Hatry&#x27;s estate.

According to Frank H. Winter in SPACEFLIGHT magazine, the initial plan was a course from Frankfurt to Rüsselsheim, site of the Opel Automobile Works and about 16 km due southwest. At the last minute, however, the Government intervened in the name of safety: There was fear that he might crash into a village or railroad station. He was thus obliged to confine the flight to the immediate environs of the Rebstock Airport, set in an otherwise uninhabited forest glade. As for the press and public, von Opel this time sincerely wished to keep them within limits, &quot;to avoid any possible trouble with the unruly crowds.&quot; According to Winter, von Opel had invited a few newspaper media and granted exclusive American rights to The New York Times and Fox Movietone for filming. Nevertheless, Universal Newsreel of the US also found a way to report on the flight with film footage as &quot;Speeds through air in rocket airplane - Fritz von Opel, millionaire daredevil, goes one and a quarter miles in flying inferno&quot;.

On 30 September 1929, it first appeared as if the flight was never going to be made. At 9 a.m., von Opel entered the RAK.1 and prepared for liftoff. Just briefly before the anticipated launch, Major Hellmuth Felmy came up informing von Opel: &quot;A telegram just came from the Oberpraesidium in Kassel. All flight tests are forbidden. Take off quick! I haven&#x27;t had the telegram yet!&quot;. Winter reports on a comment by von Opel: &quot;Felmy&#x27;s willingness to risk his position to protect my first rocket flight from bureaucratic prohibitions is something I will never forget.&quot; The order for the catapult release could be given, but the first attempt failed. Fire and smoke leapt out of the big boosters, but the sustainers failed to ignite. The RAK-1 glided back to Earth at only 50 metres (164 ft.). At 11 a.m. a second attempt was made, but the result was similar to the initial launch attempt.

At about 3:30 or 4:00 in the afternoon another attempt was made. Aviation enthusiasts, von Opel&#x27;s supporters and friends, and some of the media organizations were present. Stamer, Sander and von Opel&#x27;s fiancee and future wife Margot Löwenstein (also known as Sellnik), were there as well. Sellnik, herself a pilot and one of Germany&#x27;s six aviatrixes, had been another of von Opel&#x27;s professional advisors on aviation for the previous several months. After the flight (according to one account), she was the first to run up and congratulate him. Ten minutes after the flight, von Opel wrote down his impressions, which he afterwards dispatched to The New York Times as his exclusive. &quot;My first rocket flight!,&quot; he began. &quot;...For today&#x27;s flight I have trained for a year... For an hour before this morning&#x27;s start I inspected the course and personally went over every detail of the plane — cables, fittings and rockets... Finally I draw a deep breath and then ignite. Tremendous pressure! I feel the machine racing forward. It tries to rear like a horse. Thus I race into space as in a dream, without any feeling for space or time. The machine practically flies itself. I scarcely need to touch the wheel. I only feel the boundless intoxicating joy of making a flight such as man has never made before... The force of the rockets has expired. Visions cease; actuality calls. I must return to Earth.. Gliding with terrible bumps along the ground, the plane comes to a halt.&quot;

Exact measurements of the flight were impossible. After he had levelled off to about 100 ft. (30.5 metres), the ground crew attempted to time the flight. It was determined that he was then going at 90 mph (150 km/h). According to Heinz Gartmann, &quot;a downward gust of wind, coinciding with the edge of the landing ground, caused him to make a forced landing after only using up five rockets. At a speed of 80 mph (129 km/h) this was a difficult feat, and Opel hit the ground with a crash as the landing-skid broke and the cockpit floor was shaved away, leaving him hanging by his safety-belt with an inch to spare.&quot; Officially, von Opel had been aloft for an estimated 75 seconds, attaining a maximum velocity of 95 mph (153 km/h) and had traversed a distance of circa 3 km.

==Legacy and importance of Opel RAK for the history of spaceflight==

*Biographic Aspects
Shortly after the September 1929 flight of RAK.1, the Opel rocket experiments were brought to an end by the Great Depression and the Opel company focused its engineering capacities on vehicle development. Von Opel left Germany before 1930, first to the US and eventually to France and Switzerland where he died in 1971. He lived long enough to see the fulfillment of his dreams with the successful Apollo missions which can be traced back to Opel RAK. His sister Elinor von Opel had to flee Germany in 1935 with her sons, Ernst Wilhelm Sachs von Opel and Gunter Sachs von Opel, due a legal battle on her divorce, particularly bitter about the custody of both sons, and because of her public aversion to Nazi leadership, friends of her former husband Willy Sachs. Elinor&#x27;s German assets were blocked and confiscated by the German Reich government. Valier continued the rocket development after the Opel RAK break-up on his own. In collaboration with Heylandt-Werke, he also was focusing his efforts on liquid-fuelled rockets. Their first successful test firing with liquid fuel (five minutes) occurred in the Heylandt plant on 25 January 1930. Valier was killed less than a month later when an alcohol-fuelled rocket exploded on his test bench in Berlin. He is considered the first fatality of the dawning space age. His protégé Arthur Rudolph went on to develop an improved and safer version of Valier&#x27;s engine. Sander was eventually engaged in the 1930s in German military projects under General Walter R. Dornberger but was imprisoned for treason by the Nazis and forced to sell his business, he died in 1938. Hatry tried to continue the work on his aircraft developments, but was sidelined by the Nazis since he had a Jewish grandfather. He had to start anew and became a screenwriter and documentary filmmaker. Finally, Hatry is drawn into theater and fiction. As last survivor of the original RAK.1 aircraft team, he died in 2000.

*Technology aspects
The impact of Opel RAK was both immediate and long-lasting on later spaceflight pioneers, but also on the general audience and media. The experiments, not only the first rocket-powered flights but also the speed records of the land vehicles, were described in the media as the start of a new era:

&quot;»… Nevertheless, few, if any, among the many thousands of onlookers who witnessed the demonstration on the AVUS track could help but feel that we are poised at the beginning of a new era.«&quot; (…) 

&quot;»The amazing thing about Opel’s rocket run on the AVUS track in Berlin is not just the daring feat itself, but its aftermath: Both the public and academics have finally seen the light and have begun to believe in the future of the rocket as an engine for new rapid transit devices.«&quot; 

Opel, Sander, Valier and Hatry had engaged in a program that led directly to use of jet-assisted takeoff for heavily laden aircraft. The German Reich was first to test the approach in August 1929 when a battery of solid rocket propellants supported a Junkers Ju-33 seaplane to get airborne. The Opel RAK experiments had a tremendous influence on Lippisch, whose experience with the rocket-powered &quot;Ente&quot; eventually paved the way to the Messerschmitt Me-163, the first operational rocket fighter craft. The Opel RAK experiments excited also the interest of the German military, which provided funding for further development of rockets as a replacement for artillery. This led to an array of military applications, among them Germany&#x27;s V-2 terror weapon, the world’s first ballistic missile. After World War II, these German rocket and missile scientists and engineers would have an immense impact on missile and space programs by the United States of America. Walter J. Boyne, Director of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, concluded &quot;Working together, von Opel, Valier, and Sander had thrown a big rock of publicity into the mill pond of science. The ripples have not yet ceased to spread.&quot;

<text>A retinue is a body of persons &quot;retained&quot; in the service of a noble, royal personage, or dignitary; a &quot;suite&quot; (French &quot;what follows&quot;) of retainers.

==Etymology==
The word, recorded in English since circa 1375, stems from Old French &quot;retenue&quot;, itself from &quot;retenir&quot;, from the Latin &quot;retenere&quot;: to hold back or retain.

==Employment==
Such retainers were not necessarily in the domestic service or otherwise normally close to the presence of their lord, but also include others who wore his livery (a kind of uniform, in distinctive colours) and claimed his protection, such as musicians and tutors.

Some were a source of trouble and abuse in the 15th and early 16th century.

Often their real importance was very different from their rank: on the one hand, sinecures and appointments allowed enjoying benefits without performing full service. On the other hand, &quot;having the ear&quot; of the master can allow one to act as a confidant in an informal capacity; or in some cases, even as a spy, under the guise of an innocent musician.

The term is sometimes used in the context of the supporters or followers of a medieval knight or great lord, such as Richard, Earl of Salisbury in 15th-century England, which he called upon during the Wars of the Roses.

==Historical examples==
*Antrustion
*Cohors amicorum
*Comitatus
*Dienstmann in Austria
*Druzhina in Kievan Rus&#x27;
*Manrent, a Scottish clan bond
*Svita in the Russian Empire

<doc id="416195" wikidata="Q859387" url="?curid=416195" title="List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven">
<text>The list of compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven consists of 722 works written over forty-five years, from his earliest work in 1782 (variations for piano on a march by Ernst Christoph Dressler) when he was only eleven years old and still in Bonn, until his last work just before his death in Vienna in 1827. Beethoven composed works in all the main genres of classical music, including symphonies, concertos, string quartets, piano sonatas and opera. His compositions range from solo works to those requiring a large orchestra and chorus.

Beethoven straddled both the Classical and Romantic periods, working in genres associated with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his teacher Joseph Haydn, such as the piano concerto, string quartet and symphony, while on the other hand providing the groundwork for other Romantic composers, such as Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt, with programmatic works such as his Pastoral Symphony and Piano Sonata &quot;Les Adieux&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s work is typically divided into three periods: the &quot;Early&quot; period, where he composed in the &quot;Viennese&quot; style; the &quot;Middle&quot; or &quot;Heroic&quot; period, where his work is characterised by struggle and heroism, such as in the &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony, the Fifth Symphony, the &quot;Appassionata&quot; Sonata and in his sole opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;; and the &quot;Late&quot; period, marked by intense personal expression and an emotional and intellectual profundity. Although his output greatly diminished in his later years, this period saw the composition of masterpieces such as the late string quartets, the final five piano sonatas, the &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, the Missa Solemnis and the Ninth Symphony.

Beethoven&#x27;s works are classified by both genre and various numbering systems. The best-known numbering system for Beethoven&#x27;s works is that by opus number, assigned by Beethoven&#x27;s publishers during his lifetime. Only 172 of Beethoven&#x27;s works have opus numbers, divided among 138 opus numbers. Many works that were unpublished or published without opus numbers have been assigned one of &quot;WoO&quot; (&quot;Werke ohne Opuszahl&quot;—works without opus number), Hess or Biamonti numbers. For example, the short piano piece &quot;Für Elise&quot; is more fully known as the &quot;Bagatelle in A minor, WoO 59 (&#x27;Für Elise&#x27;)&quot;. Some works are also commonly referred to by their nicknames, such as the &quot;Kreutzer&quot; Violin Sonata, or the &quot;Archduke&quot; Piano Trio.

Works are also often identified by their number within their genre. For example, the 14th string quartet, published as Opus 131, may be referenced either as &quot;String Quartet No. 14&quot; or &quot;the Opus 131 String Quartet&quot;. The listings below include all of these relevant identifiers. While other catalogues of Beethoven&#x27;s works exist, the numbers here represent the most commonly used.

==List of works by genre==

Beethoven&#x27;s works are published in several editions, the first of these was &quot;Ludwig van Beethovens Werke: Vollständige kritisch durchgesehene überall berechtigte Ausgabe&quot; published between 1862 and 1865 with a supplemental volume in 1888 by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, commonly known as the &quot;Beethoven Gesamtausgabe&quot; [GA]. While this was a landmark achievement at the time, the limitations of this edition soon became apparent. Between 1959 and 1971 Willy Hess prepared a supplemental edition, &quot;Beethoven: Sämtliche Werke: Supplemente zur Gesamtausgabe&quot;, [HS] containing works that were not in the &quot;Gesamtausgabe&quot;.

Since 1961 the Beethoven Archive has been publishing a new scholarly–critical Complete Edition of Beethoven&#x27;s works, &quot;Beethoven: Werke: neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke&quot; [NA]. However, only 42 of the projected 56 volumes have been published so far. As this edition has not been published in full there are works without an NA designation.

Legend for publications – p: parts s: full score vs: vocal score

===Orchestral music===
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies, nine concertos, and a variety of other orchestral music, ranging from overtures and incidental music for theatrical productions to other miscellaneous &quot;occasional&quot; works, written for a particular occasion. Of the concertos, seven are widely known (one violin concerto, five piano concertos, and one triple concerto for violin, piano, and cello); the other two are an early piano concerto (WoO 4) and an arrangement of the Violin Concerto for piano and orchestra (Opus 61a).

====Piano sonatas====

====Piano variations====

====Shorter piano pieces====

==List of works by Beethoven==
The following is a list of Beethoven&#x27;s works, sorted by Opus number, followed by works listed as WoO in the Kinsky–Halm Catalogue, and then works listed in the appendix of that catalogue, which are given &quot;Anhang&quot; numbers. These are followed by additional works with Hess numbers listed in the catalogue of Willy Hess that are not otherwise listed in the Kinsky–Halm Catalogue. Lastly there are works with Biamonti numbers (Bia.), from the Biamonti Catalogue, an attempt to catalogue everything that Beethoven wrote in chronological order, though there are works that were not known at the time it was compiled. Thus there is no definitive catalogue of Beethoven&#x27;s works to match the Deutsch catalogue for Schubert or the Köchel catalogue for Mozart.

===Works with opus numbers===
The opus numbers were assigned by publishers to Beethoven&#x27;s works as they were published. The opus numbers do not include all works that were published in Beethoven&#x27;s lifetime nor are they in chronological order. For instance, the Octet Op. 103 was written before November 1792, while Op. 102 and Op. 104 were written in 1815 and 1817 respectively.

The numbers and categories used below are from the Kinsky–Halm Catalogue of 1955. &quot;WoO&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;Werke ohne Opuszahl&quot;, German for &quot;Works without Opus number&quot;. While some of these works were published during Beethoven&#x27;s lifetime but not given opus numbers, for instance the piano variations WoO 80, others like Für Elise WoO 59 were not published until later.

<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s [[opus number]] 27 is a set of two piano sonatas. They were published separately in March 1802. Both sonatas are entitled , which roughly translated as sonatas in the style of a fantasia. The second sonata is one of the most famous piano works in the repertoire and often called the &quot;Moonlight sonata&quot;, a contentious name not given by the composer himself. The first sonata remains far less performed than the second and the two sonatas are not commonly performed together.

They are named so for their only loose adherence to the sonata form. The first movement of both sonatas are slow and lacking in full sonata form. The second movements are scherzos. The sonatas differ in structure in the third movement and only the first sonata has a fourth movement. In the first sonata, thematic material is referenced from one movement to the other which is also uncommon in a typical sonata of the time but more like the fantasia style.

They were written in 1801. For the individual sonatas see:

*Piano Sonata No. 13 in E major
*Piano Sonata No. 14 (&quot;Moonlight sonata&quot;) in C minor

<text>Rice paper is a product constructed of paper-like materials made from different plants. These include:
*&quot;Thin peeled dried pith of Tetrapanax papyrifer&quot;: A sheet-like &quot;paper&quot; material was used extensively in late 19th century Guangdong, China as a common support medium for gouache paintings sold to Western clients of the era. The term was first defined in the Chinese–English Dictionary of Robert Morrison who referred to the use of the Chinese medicinal plant as material for painting, as well as for making artificial flowers and shoe soles.
*&quot;Xuan paper made from paper mulberry&quot;: The traditional paper which originated in ancient China and it has been used for centuries in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam for writing, artwork, and architecture.
*&quot;Various pulp-based papers&quot;: May be made from the rice straw or other plants, such as hemp and bamboo.
*&quot;Dried starch sheets of various thickness or texture&quot;: These edible paper sheets have some properties of pulp paper and can be made from rice starch. They are known as bánh tráng, used in Vietnamese cuisine.

==Rice paper plant==
In Europe, around the 1900s, a paperlike substance was originally known as rice paper, due to the mistaken notion that it is made from rice. In fact, it consists of the pith of a small tree, &quot;Tetrapanax papyrifer&quot;, the &quot;rice paper plant&quot; (蓪草).

The plant grows in the swampy forests of Taiwan, and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its large, exotic leaves. In order to produce the paper, the boughs are boiled and freed from bark. The cylindrical core of pith is rolled on a hard flat surface against a knife, by which it is cut into thin sheets of a fine ivory-like texture.

Dyed in various colours, this rice paper is extensively used for the preparation of artificial flowers, while the white sheets are employed for watercolor drawings. Due to its texture, this paper is not suited for writing.

==Mulberry paper==

This &quot;rice paper&quot;, smooth, thin, crackly, and strong, is named as a wrapper for rice, and is made from bark fibres of the paper mulberry tree. It is used for origami, calligraphy, paper screens and clothing. It is stronger than commercially made wood-pulp paper. Less commonly, the paper is made from rice straw.

Depending on the type of mulberry used, it is named kozo (&quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;, the paper mulberry), gampi (&quot;Wikstroemia diplomorpha&quot;), or mitsumata (&quot;Edgeworthia chrysantha&quot;). The fiber comes from the bark of the paper mulberry, not the inner wood or pith, and traditionally the paper is made by hand.

The branches of the paper mulberry shrubs are harvested in the autumn, so the fibre can be processed and the paper formed during the cold winter months, because the fibre spoils easily in the heat. The branches are cut into sections two to three feet long and steamed in a large kettle, which makes the bark shrink back from the inner wood, allowing it to be pulled off like a banana peel. The bark can then be dried and stored, or used immediately. There are three layers to the bark at this stage: black bark, the outermost layer; green bark, the middle layer; and white bark, the innermost layer. All three can be made into paper, but the finest paper is made of white bark only.

If the bark strips have been dried, they are soaked in water overnight before being processed further. To clean the black and green bark from the white bark, the bark strip is spread on a board and scraped with a flat knife. Any knots or tough spots in the fibre are cut out and discarded at this stage.

The scraped bark strips are then cooked for two or three hours in a mixture of water and soda ash. The fibre is cooked enough when it can easily be pulled apart lengthwise. The strips are then rinsed several times in clean water to rinse off the soda ash. Rinsing also makes the fibre brighter and whiter—fine kozo paper is not bleached, but is naturally pure white.

Each bark strip is then inspected by hand, against a white background or lit from behind by a light box. Any tiny pieces of black bark and other debris are removed with tweezers, and any knots or tough patches of fibre missed during scraping are cut out of the strips. The ultimate goal is to have completely pure white bark.

The scraped, cooked, and cleaned strips are then laid out on a table and beaten by hand. The beating tool is a wooden bat that looks like a thicker version of a cricket bat. The fibres are beaten for about half an hour, or until all the fibres have been separated and no longer resemble strips of bark.

The prepared fibre can now be made into sheets of paper. A viscous substance called formation aid is added to the vat with the fibre and water. Formation aid is polyethylene oxide, and it helps slow the flow of water, which gives the paper-maker more time to form sheets. Sheets are formed with multiple thin layers of fibre, one on top of another.

==Vietnamese rice paper==

&quot;Rice paper&quot; is created from the process of creating rice noodles known as bún, one of the specialties made from rice and cassava starch in Vietnamese cuisine. &quot;Bánh tráng&quot; originates from the Southern provinces. The Northern and Central provinces also created many other types of rice paper with different names. Rice paper has many types from traditional rice paper, coconut milk rice paper, coconut rice paper, mango rice paper, pandan leaf rice paper, etc.

Edible rice paper is used for making gỏi cuốn or chả giò in Vietnamese cuisine, where the rice paper is called &quot;bánh tráng&quot; or &quot;bánh đa nem&quot;. Ingredients of the food rice paper include white rice flour, tapioca flour, salt, and water. The tapioca powder makes the rice paper glutinous and smooth. It is usually sold dried in thin, crisp, translucent round sheets that are wrapped in cellophane. The sheets are individually dipped briefly for a few seconds in warm or cool water to soften, then wrapped around savoury or sweet ingredients.

Edible paper is used in the home baking of foods such as macarons and is often sold separately as colored sheets that are either plain or printed with images, such as bank notes.

<doc id="416217" wikidata="Q1612323" url="?curid=416217" title="Hippocleides">
<text>Hippocleides (also Hippoclides) (), the son of Teisander (Τείσανδρος), was an Athenian nobleman, who served as Eponymous Archon for the year 566 BC – 565 BC.

He was a member of the Philaidae, a wealthy Athenian family that was opposed to the Peisistratos family. During his term as archon, he set up the statue of Athena Promachos (πρὀμαχος) in Athens and oversaw a reorganization of the Panathenaia festival.

==&quot;Hippocleides doesn&#x27;t care&quot;==

As a young man, he competed for the hand of Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes, the tyrant of Sicyon. By the end of the competitions, only Hippocleides and Megacles remained. According to Herodotus (6.129-130), Hippocleides became intoxicated during a dinner party with Cleisthenes, and began to act like a fool; at one point he stood on his head and kicked his legs in the air, keeping time with the flute music. When Hippocleides was informed by Cleisthenes &quot;Oh son of Teisander, you have just danced away your marriage,&quot; his response was &quot;οὐ φροντὶς Ἱπποκλείδῃ&quot;, (&quot;Hippocleides doesn&#x27;t care&quot; or literally &quot;No care for Hippocleides&quot;). The phrase, according to Herodotus, became a common expression in the Greek world.

The phrase was well known to later authors; Aristophanes paraphrases it in &quot;The Wasps&quot;. Lucian uses it in his essay &quot;Apology for the Dependent Scholar&quot;. Plutarch, who disliked Herodotus, says the author &quot;would dance away the truth&quot; like Hippocleides.

John Henry Newman, in his famous &quot;Apologia pro Vita Sua&quot;, applied this saying to himself: &quot;I am aware that what I have been saying will, with many men, be doing credit to my imagination at the expense of my judgment—&#x27;Hippoclides doesn&#x27;t care;&#x27; I am not setting myself up as a pattern of good sense or of anything else: I am but vindicating myself from the charge of dishonesty.&quot;

T. E. Lawrence adopted the phrase as a motto and wrote letters quoting the phrase. He also had the Greek translation &quot;ου φροντις&quot; inscribed over the cottage door at Clouds Hill in Dorset.

<doc id="416229" wikidata="Q1062266" url="?curid=416229" title="Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary">
<text>The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is a sanctuary off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in Southern California south of San Francisco and north of Los Angeles. It was designated on October 2, 1980, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and was expanded in 2007.

==Description==
The sanctuary encompasses approximately of ocean waters around Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and Santa Barbara Islands, extending from the mean high tide of these islands to offshore, and surrounding Channel Islands National Park. It is part of the National Marine Sanctuary program under the administration of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Its remote, isolated position at the confluence of two major ocean currents supports remarkable biodiversity and productivity. It is a special place for endangered species, sensitive habitats, historic shipwrecks, other maritime heritage artifacts, and living Chumash culture. Many valuable commercial and recreational activities thrive in the sanctuary, such as fishing, shipping, and tourism.

The United States Government designated the sanctuary because of its national significance as an area of exceptional natural beauty and resources, and due to heightened concerns following a 1969 oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel. Protection of sanctuary resources is supported through research, education, conservation, and stewardship programs. The primary goal of the sanctuary is the protection of natural and cultural resources contained within its boundaries. The sanctuary is managed to promote ecosystem conservation, protect cultural resources, and support compatible human uses.

==Education==
The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is dedicated to education and outreach aiming to promote understanding, support, and participation in the protection and conservation of marine resources.

===Visitors centers, education partners, and related organizations===
The sanctuary&#x27;s visitor center works to interpret the living and maritime heritage resources that are a part of the sanctuary.

===Outreach products===
The sanctuary distributes brochures and other resources such as posters, maps, and coloring books for the public mostly providing information about the biodiversity in the sanctuary as well as how to preserve it.

=== Students at Sea ===
The Students at Sea Program is addressed to high schools and college students. Participants explore different career pathways and learn how science is used to address different resource protection issues that threaten the health of the ocean.

===Teachers at Sea===
The Teachers at Sea Program is addressed to elementary school through high school teachers. They are involved in hands-on activities such as conducting plankton tows, viewing plankton under a video microscope, piloting remotely operated underwater vehicles, sampling water quality parameters such as pH and salinity and learning about current sanctuary research. The aim of the program is for participating teachers to have the tools and resources to then pass what they learn and experience on to their students.

==Research==
The sanctuary has partnerships with the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Park Service, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, as well as regional and international academic institutions such as the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, and the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. These partnerships are facilitated by staff research expertise as well as operational support provided by the NOAA research vessels &quot;Shearwater&quot; and &quot;Shark Cat&quot;.

The sanctuary is currently engaging in the following research:

===Marine Protected Area monitoring===
Within the sanctuary, there is a network of 13 state and federal marine reserves and conservation areas that provide additional protections to the ecosystem. The marine reserves network was established to protect whole ecosystems and restore ecosystem health. One possible effect of marine reserves is that they may provide &quot;spillover benefits&quot; to areas outside the reserves. Sanctuary staff are currently conducting research on the effectiveness of marine reserves for community dynamics. In one project, performed in collaboration with the Channel Islands National Park and colleagues at Simon Fraser University, staff are evaluating the food web interactions expressed in the long-term Kelp Forest Monitoring data set that the Channel Islands National Park has been collecting since 1984. That project has revealed that trophic relationships within MPAs are more robust, while outside MPAs these relationships are less so and the food web shows lower resilience and stability. In other work, with colleagues at the University of Auckland, they are examining potential competition between predators protected within MPAs (large fish and lobsters) and fishers who are targeting the prey of those predators (sea urchins). In addition, the sanctuary&#x27;s ongoing maintenance of a network of oceanographic sensors provides a data stream that can contribute to our understanding of larval transport and adult animal movement across MPA boundaries.

===Climate variability===

Sanctuary staff are currently looking at how short-term changes in climate can affect local conditions across large areas. Their work on the role of variability in jet stream trajectory and strength in determining seasonal variability in central Siberia allows a new and significantly more accurate ability to forecast the arrival of harsh winters several months in advance. This work has contributed to a better, more mechanistic understanding of the connectedness of climate processes across the Northern Hemisphere, from Siberia all the way to the US West Coast. More recently, they are looking at how these same processes manifest in long term data on winds along the Central and Southern California coast to see how climate variability signals can affect local winds in the Santa Barbara Channel area. Variation in wind strength has ecological effects by driving upwelling and also has a practical implication for local mariners: if climate change causes more windy days, there are fewer days for boating and fishing in the sanctuary. Additionally, the sanctuary&#x27;s ongoing maintenance of a network of moorings provides a continuous data series of oceanographic conditions in nearshore waters that is informing climate variability studies.

=== Sanctuary Aerial Monitoring and Spatial Analysis Program ===
The Sanctuary Aerial Monitoring and Spatial Analysis Program (SAMSAP) is an ongoing long-term aerial monitoring program that collects data on vessel and visitor use patterns and cetacean populations within the sanctuary. SAMSAP has been active since 1997 and has been instrumental in providing vital data for management, research, and emergency response needs.

===Whale research===

After populations of large whales were decimated by whaling in the last two centuries, several species are rebounding. Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is a seasonal home to several species of those large whales. From early spring to late fall, the sanctuary sees increasing numbers of humpback, blue, and fin whales- with seasonally migrating gray whales transiting the sanctuary on their trips between the North Pacific and the lagoons of Baja California. At times, large whales aggregate in tremendous numbers, with as many as 186 unique photo identifications occurring in a single day. Understanding the causes of this aggregation, such as bloom dynamics of the krill the whales feed on, can provide valuable forecasting information to predict where whales are likely to be in the near term. This information in turn could aid in reducing whale-ship interactions. Ongoing work has focused on behavioral responses of large whales to close encounters with large vessels transiting the Santa Barbara Channel. This work is being extended to focus on two problems: how variability in krill depth is key to whale decision making, and how the whales are selecting specific sized prey within pools of mixed-age krill. To get after these questions, sanctuary staff and contractors are combining an ongoing program of tagging large whales with time-depth-location recording tags with systematic mapping of krill fields around the sanctuary. The sanctuary is assisting the work of partners from Cascadia Research Collective and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

===Shipping===
The Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach is the largest commercial harbor on the west coast with over 6,500 vessels stopping each year. Much of that traffic passes the Santa Barbara Channel and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary on its way to ports around the Pacific Rim. These vessels are large, with some being over 1,000 feet long, and fast; they can travel at speeds over 20 knots. They also emit significant exhaust into the area and are the principal source of underwater noise in the sanctuary. To keep track of how these ships may affect the sanctuary staff have been building on a long-term program to monitor broad band acoustics in and around the sanctuary. As a first step they are developing data management solutions with partners at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis for two new data streams: broadband acoustic data and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data on ship travel. Although both sources of data were originally developed for other objectives—oceanographic research and safety at sea—these data streams provide valuable information for evaluation of spatial use patterns. For example, recent work evaluating California State air quality rulings on vessel fuel use demonstrated a major change in traffic patterns and emerging conflicts in use of the ocean by shipping and National Defense interests. Evaluating these data in the context of shifts of vessel traffic has also revealed quantitative relationships between economic indicators (numbers of ships and amount of cargo) and noise levels in the sanctuary.

===Deep water communities===
The sanctuary contains a significant amount of deep-water habitat: about 91.5% of the sanctuary is deeper than 100 ft. From depths of 100 ft to over 5,000 ft, deep water habitat experiences cold water, almost no light, and low oxygen, yet a variety of specially adapted animals such as corals, sponges, crabs, shrimp, fish, anemones, cucumbers, sea stars, and worms reside here. In 2010, a NOAA expedition surveyed an underwater feature in the Footprint Marine Reserve to learn more about the abundance and distribution of coral and sponge habitat and to study the chemistry of the water in which these animals live.

== Recreational activities ==

The sanctuary is also a site for recreational activities, such as scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, boating, viewing wildlife, and fishing.

In an effort to balance recreation and conservation, the California Fish and Game Commission established a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within the nearshore waters of the sanctuary in 2002. The NOAA expanded the MPA network into the sanctuary&#x27;s deeper waters in 2006 and 2007. The entire MPA network consists of 11 marine reserves: Richardson Rock, Judith Rock, Harris Point, South Point, Carrington Point, Skunk Point, Gull Island, Painted Cave, Scorpion, Footprint, and Anacapa Island&quot;.&quot; All take and harvest from these marine reserves is prohibited. There are two marine conservation areas that allow limited take of lobster and pelagic fish. This MPA network encompasses .

More than 150 historic ships and aircraft have been reported lost within the waters of the sanctuary, although just 25 have been discovered to date.

==Maritime Heritage==
Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is responsible for the protection and preservation of submerged remains of the past that occupy the bottomlands of the sanctuary. Cultural and historic submerged sites include archaeological remains of shipwrecks and prehistoric land sites. Sanctuary stewardship responsibilities include a mandate to inventory sites, encourage research, provide public education and oversee responsible visitor use.

==Chumash==

The Northern Channel Islands have been home to the Chumash people for millennia, with the earliest known human remains dating back more than 13,000 years ago. The Chumash community continues to celebrate their maritime heritage through local cultural events such as an annual crossing of the Santa Barbara Channel on traditional plank canoes known as tomols.

The Sanctuary Advisory Council was established in December 1998 to assure continued public participation in management of the sanctuary. It provides a public forum for consultation and community deliberation on resource management issues affecting the waters surrounding the Channel Islands. It is composed of 21 members and 21 alternate seats that include local stakeholder groups and governmental agencies.

==Threats to the sanctuary==
Protecting the resources of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is a collaborative effort involving local, state and federal agencies as well as numerous non-governmental organizations. The sanctuary focuses on education, permitting, regulations, emergency response preparedness, enforcement, and consultation with other agencies to help protect the sanctuary&#x27;s resources.

Current threats in the sanctuary include ship strikes on endangered whales, ocean acidification, invasive species, damage to eelgrass beds, marine debris, poaching, and water pollution.

<doc id="416231" wikidata="Q6569630" url="?curid=416231" title="List of Eagle Scouts">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Scouts BSA program division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; Since it was first awarded to Arthur Rose Eldred on August 21, 1912, Eagle Scout has been earned by more than two million youth. The list below includes notable recipients.

, requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit, leadership, and service. The requirements include an Eagle Scout Service Project where the Scout must further demonstrate service and leadership. Eagle Scouts are recognized with a medal and a cloth badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Eagle Palms are a further recognition, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements. Typically adult volunteers who have received the Eagle award as a youth wear a smaller patch depicting a square knot.

The Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) is bestowed to Eagle Scouts for nationally renowned distinguished service in their profession and to the community for a period of at least 25 years after earning the Eagle Scout rank. Since its introduction in 1969 by the National Eagle Scout Association, the DESA has been awarded to over 2,000 Eagle Scouts.

The NESA Outstanding Eagle Scout Award (NOESA) is bestowed to Eagle Scouts who have distinguished themselves at a local-to-regional level or who have not yet met the 25-year tenure requirement to be considered for a DESA. This award was introduced in 2011.

==African-American Eagle Scouts==
The Boy Scouts did not track the race of scouts who earned the rank of Eagle. For many years it was thought that Edgar Cunningham, who earned his rank in 1926 as a member of Troop 12 in Waterloo, Iowa in what was then Wapsipinicon Area Council, was the first black recipient of the Eagle rank.

In February 2020, it was discovered that Harry Cooper of the Kansas City Council, became an Eagle Scout in September 1920. In the Kansas City Council (now the Heart of America Council) newsletter dated 1920, Harry Cooper of Troop 92 was listed as a new Eagle Scout as of September. The newsletter lists him as the only African American Eagle Scout in Kansas City, one of only ten Eagle Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri at the time.

In March 2020, further research showed that the Eagle Scout court of honor for Hamilton Bradley of the Rome Council, was held on December 19, 1919, in Rome, New York. This makes Bradley the earliest known black Eagle Scout.

Dr. Frank &quot;Tick&quot; Coleman, who earned his Eagle in 1926 is one of the first four known African-American Eagle Scouts.

==Incorrectly regarded as an Eagle Scout==
These persons, while notable in themselves, are sometimes incorrectly listed as having earned the award:

* Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Aaron; retired baseball player and member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. He is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award. He is often thought to be an Eagle Scout because of an advertisement he did for the BSA.
* Walter Cronkite; anchorman, journalist and commentator.
* Henry Fonda; actor and Academy Award winner who was a Scout and Scoutmaster. Incorrectly noted as an Eagle Scout by his daughter.
* Bill Gates; Life Scout and co-founder of Microsoft. He is sometimes confused with his father, William H. Gates Sr. who is a Distinguished Eagle Scout. He is often thought to be an Eagle Scout because of an advertisement he did for the BSA.

<text>The Ottawa 67&#x27;s are a major junior ice hockey team based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that plays in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Established during Canada&#x27;s centennial year of 1967 and named in honour of this, the 67&#x27;s currently play their home games at TD Place Arena. The 67&#x27;s are three-time OHL champions, and have played in the Memorial Cup five times, winning in 1984 and as host team in 1999.

==History==
The Ontario Hockey Association granted the city of Ottawa an expansion franchise on February 16, 1967. Four months later, the team was given the nickname 67&#x27;s, in honour of Canada&#x27;s centennial year. Three local businessmen—Bill Cowley, Howard Darwin and Bill Touhey as well as Alderman Howard Henry—helped bring junior hockey back to Canada&#x27;s capital. The 67&#x27;s filled the hockey void left by the departure of the junior Hull–Ottawa Canadiens and the semi-professional Hull-Ottawa Canadiens. However, before the team played a game Touhey left the ownership group and Jack Kinsella became one of the owners in his stead.

Bill Long was the team&#x27;s first head coach. The 67&#x27;s played their first game on October 6, 1967, losing 9–0 on the road to the Niagara Falls Flyers. The first 11 home games of the season were played in the Hull Arena, Hull, Quebec, as their new home arena was still under construction. They played their first game at their own arena, the Ottawa Civic Centre, on December 29, losing to the Montreal Junior Canadiens 4–2. The first season for the 67&#x27;s was terrible at best, with the team posting a final record of six wins, 45 losses and three ties. They made the playoffs in their second season, but lost in the quarter-finals to the Niagara Falls Flyers. They won their first playoff series over the Hamilton Red Wings in 1970–71, led by future Hockey Hall of Famer Denis Potvin on defence. The 67&#x27;s reached the OHA finals during the following season in 1971–72. They lost to the Peterborough Petes 3–0, with two ties. The 67&#x27;s came close to playing at home in the Memorial Cup, as the Ottawa Civic Centre hosted the tournament that year.
===Brian Kilrea joins the 67&#x27;s===
Darwin announced in May 1972 that he would resign as team president in June 1972 and this was quickly followed by Bill Long&#x27;s departure as general manager and head coach in June as well. Howard Henry was announced as the team&#x27;s new president. Leo Boivin was named as Long&#x27;s successor as head coach of the 67&#x27;s and Ross Tyrell as general manager on June 18. After a rebuilding season in 1973–74, after which both Boivin and Tyrell were let go by the team after a surprise loss to the Peterborough Petes in the playoffs the 67&#x27;s hired a young up-and-coming coach named Brian Kilrea as both coach and general manager. Kilrea coached the team to three successive improved winning records, culminating in a victory in the J. Ross Robertson Cup finals in 1977, versus the London Knights, who were coached by former 67&#x27;s bench boss Bill Long. During the late 1970s, Ottawa was led by scoring champions Peter Lee, Bobby Smith and Jim Fox and future Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman Doug Wilson.

The 67&#x27;s moved on to compete for the 1977 Memorial Cup versus the champions of the other Canadian major junior leagues, the New Westminster Bruins of the Western Canada Hockey League, and the Sherbrooke Castors of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). The 1977 Memorial Cup tournament was the first to be held in British Columbia and the first to use a double round-robin format. Ottawa lost the first game 7–6 to the Bruins, then won three in a row, 6–1 over the Castors, 4–3 in overtime versus the Bruins, and then 5–2 against Sherbrooke. However, Ottawa lost to the host Bruins 6–5 in the championship game. Bobby Smith and goaltender Pat Riggin were named to the tournament&#x27;s all-star team.

Ottawa finished first in their division the following season, and were tipped to go all the way to the Memorial Cup tournament again, but struggled to finish off the Wayne Gretzky-led Soo Greyhounds in the first round and lost to the rival Peterborough Petes in the semi-finals. The 67&#x27;s rebuilt during the 1978–79 season, and returned to play for a second J. Ross Robertson Cup versus the Kitchener Rangers at the end of the 1981–82 season. They were swept by the Rangers, but that season marked the first of three consecutive division titles from 1982 to 1984.

===First Memorial Cup victory===
In 1984, the 67&#x27;s reached the OHL championship series in a rematch from the 1982 OHL finals, against the Kitchener Rangers. As the team with the most points in the league, Kitchener had been chosen to host the 1984 Memorial Cup tournament. In the OHL itself, however, Ottawa had unfinished business, having lost to Kitchener two years earlier. The 67&#x27;s, who finished second overall to Kitchener in the OHL, defeated the Rangers and won their second J. Ross Robertson Cup and earned a place in the Memorial Cup tournament.

At the Memorial Cup in Kitchener, Ottawa faced the Laval Voisins, featuring Mario Lemieux, of the QMJHL and the Kamloops Jr. Oilers of the now renamed Western Hockey League (WHL). The 67&#x27;s were led by Gary Roberts, Brad Shaw, and Bruce Cassidy. The 67&#x27;s won against Laval and Kamloops before losing to Kitchener in the round-robin series. In the semi-final game, Ottawa beat Kamloops again and in the finals versus Kitchener, Ottawa scored a victory, winning their first Memorial Cup. Adam Creighton was named the tournament&#x27;s most valuable player and goaltender Darren Pang was named the tournament&#x27;s top goalie. Creighton, Pang, Shaw, Cassidy, Jim Camazzola and Don McLaren of the 67&#x27;s were all named to the tournament&#x27;s all-star team. After the season ended, Kilrea left Ottawa to become an assistant coach in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New York Islanders.

===Kilrea returns from the NHL===
Cliff Stewart was hired to replace Kilrea in August 1984 as the 67&#x27;s graduated many of their star players following their cup win. Stewart lasted until November, replacing him with Bob Ellett. The rebuilding team suffered through two dismal seasons after winning the cup, finishing third-last in the OHL in 1985 and second-last in 1986. Ellett resigned at the end of the season and Brian Kilrea, out of contract with the Islanders, returned for the 1986–87 season. The second Kilrea era was not as superb as his first coaching stint. The 67&#x27;s finished as high as second place in their division two times, and reached the league&#x27;s playoff semi-finals three times. The highlight of this era was Andrew Cassels, the rookie of the year in 1986–87, and scoring champion in 1987–88. Kilrea went into coaching retirement after the 1993–94 season, remaining as the general manager. For the 1994–95 season, the 67&#x27;s were coached by former scoring champion Peter Lee.

===The third Kilrea era===
Brian Kilrea came out of coaching retirement in 1995 and replaced Lee. On June 10, 1998, Jeff Hunt purchased the team from Howard Darwin and Earl Montagano. Kilrea was asked by Hunt to remain as coach for three more years, but would remain as coach until the end of the 2008–09 season, retaining his duties as general manager until 2011. He was replaced by Chris Byrne, first as coach, then as general manager. The Kilrea-coached 67&#x27;s resurged to the top of the OHL, winning five consecutive east division titles from 1996 to 2000. In 1996–97, Ottawa finished with the most points in the league with 104, however, lost in the finals 4–2 to their division rivals, the Oshawa Generals. The 67&#x27;s reached the finals again in 1998, losing to the Guelph Storm in five games.

===Memorial Cup hosts, 1999===
In 1999, 67&#x27;s owner Jeff Hunt led the team&#x27;s bid to host the 1999 Memorial Cup tournament. Despite the fact that in 1997 the tournament had been hosted across the river in Hull, he was able to convince the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) to host the event in Ottawa and guarantee his team a berth in the tournament. The 67&#x27;s did not disappoint, as every game of the series was sold out. In the 1998–99 season, the 67&#x27;s lost to the eventual OHL champion Belleville Bulls in the second round of the playoffs. As hosts, they still took part in the Memorial Cup tournament and faced the Bulls, the Calgary Hitmen of the WHL and the Acadie–Bathurst Titan of the QMJHL. The 67&#x27;s beat the Belleville Bulls in the Memorial Cup semi-finals and went on to defeat the Calgary Hitmen in the final in a thrilling over-time game that saw Matt Zultek score the winning goal. Nick Boynton was named the tournament most valuable player.

===Memorial Cup, 2001===
After winning their fifth division title, the 67&#x27;s were bounced in the second round of the playoffs by the Belleville Bulls in 2000. However, it was not long before the 67&#x27;s went to the Memorial Cup again. Ottawa defeated the Plymouth Whalers in the league championship capturing their second J. Ross Robertson Cup. The 2001 Memorial Cup was played in Regina, Saskatchewan. Ottawa had tougher luck in this tournament, winning just one game in the round robin versus the hometown Regina Pats, then ultimately losing to Regina 5–0 in the tie-breaker game. In the 2002–03 season, the 67&#x27;s reached the OHL finals again, but fell to the eventual Memorial Cup champions Kitchener Rangers in five games. Ottawa, which won the division in 2003–04, suffered a surprise first round defeat in the playoffs to the Brampton Battalion.

===Memorial Cup, 2005===

The 67&#x27;s finished in sixth place in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05, but had a veteran-laden team that managed an impressive playoff run. Ottawa upset the Barrie Colts, Sudbury Wolves and Peterborough Petes to reach the finals versus the London Knights. The 67&#x27;s lost the OHL championship to the Knights, but qualified for the 2005 Memorial Cup by virtue of being the league finalists versus the Knights, who were also hosting the event. In the tournament, Ottawa faced the Knights, the Rimouski Océanic of the QMJHL, featuring Sidney Crosby, and the Kelowna Rockets of the WHL. The 67&#x27;s won the longest ever game played in the Memorial Cup tournament, when they beat the Rockets in double overtime. Ottawa finished in third place in the round-robin, and then lost to the Océanic in the semi-finals.

==Championships==
The Ottawa 67&#x27;s have appeared in the Memorial Cup tournament five times, winning twice. Ottawa has also won the J. Ross Robertson Cup three times, won the Hamilton Spectator Trophy three times, and have won fourteen division titles, the most in the OHL.
==Coaches==
Brian Kilrea had a long term coaching relationship with the 67&#x27;s. Kilrea led the team to three OHL Championships and two Memorial Cups. Kilrea briefly moved up to the NHL as an assistant coach with the New York Islanders from 1984 to 1986, and briefly retired for the 1994–95 season. Kilrea, nicknamed &quot;Killer&quot;, has over 1,000 wins coaching junior hockey, all with the 67&#x27;s. He was named the OHL Coach of the Year five times, and CHL Coach of the Year twice. Kilrea was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003. On September 3, 2008, Kilrea announced that at the end of the 2008–09, he would step down from his head coaching position. He remained with the team as their general manager until the 2011–12 season, after which he was replaced in that post by head coach Chris Byrne.

Andre Tourigny won OHL Coach of the Year award in 2018–19 leading the 67&#x27;s to a 50–12–6 record and a franchise record-breaking 106 points. Tourigny won a second consecutive OHL Coach of the Year award in 2019–20 going 50–11–1 in a shortened season and earning the CHL Coach of the Year in the process. Dave Cameron is the 67&#x27;s most recent recipient of the award, taking home the honours after leading the club to their record setting 51-win season in 2022–23. He also won CHL Coach of the Year in that same season.

==Uniforms and logos==
The 67&#x27;s colours and original uniforms are based on those of the Ottawa Senators from the 1920s and 1930s. The team colours are red, white &amp; black. The 67&#x27;s dark jerseys, only slightly altered from the original design, have horizontal &quot;barber-pole&quot; stripes with the rectangular 67&#x27;s logo. The 67&#x27;s have also used a white background jersey with barber-pole stripes on the shoulders and sleeves.

 An alternate jersey was unveiled in 2001. In keeping with their new &quot;Hockey With Bite&quot; slogan, it featured a logo with an angry puck, and a white background body with jagged red and black trim lines along the bottom and arms. It also had an opposite black background style with white &amp; red trim. This third jersey was discontinued in 2012, but the &quot;Angry Puck&quot; motif still features on some 67&#x27;s merchandise.

==Arenas==
The Ottawa 67&#x27;s played the first half of their 1967–68 inaugural season at the Robert Guertin Arena in Hull, Quebec, until completion of the new arena at Lansdowne Park. The Ottawa 67&#x27;s have played at TD Place Arena since January 1968 when it was known as the Ottawa Civic Centre. The arena has a capacity between 8,000 and 9,500 spectators. However, the guest capacity reached as high as 10,449 for Ottawa Senators games, when the NHL team played in the arena while awaiting the construction of their own rink. TD Place Arena is built into the side of a football stadium and the seating in TD Place Arena is almost all on the north side and ends of the arena, with very few seats on the south side towards the football stadium. 

Over the years, the team has hosted events in other local arenas, such as the Corel Centre (now named the Canadian Tire Centre), where in 2004, they played a game against the Kingston Frontenacs that was viewed by an CHL-record crowd of 20,081. In early February 2012, it was announced that the 67&#x27;s would move to the Canadian Tire Centre for two seasons while renovations were finished at TD Place Arena. This came as a result of delays in construction originally planned to allow the 67&#x27;s to stay at TD Place through the rebuild but a closed site was needed to meet deadlines for NASL and CFL expansion. The team returned to TD Place Arena in August 2014 ahead of the 2014–15 season.

<doc id="416246" wikidata="Q424049" url="?curid=416246" title="Loratadine">
<text>Loratadine, sold under the brand name Claritin among others, is a medication used to treat allergies. This includes allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and hives. It is also available in drug combinations such as loratadine/pseudoephedrine, in which it is combined with pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant. It is taken orally.
Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, and headache. Serious side effects are rare and include allergic reactions, seizures, and liver problems. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied. It is not recommended in children less than two years old. It is in the second-generation antihistamine family of medications.
Loratadine was patented in 1980 and came to market in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Loratadine is available as a generic medication. In the United States, it is available over the counter. In 2022, it was the 72nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with pseudoephedrine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Loratadine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of allergies such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis), urticaria (hives), chronic idiopathic urticaria, and other skin allergies. For allergic rhinitis, loratadine is indicated for both nasal and eye symptoms including sneezing, runny nose, and itchy or burning eyes.

Similarly to cetirizine, loratadine attenuates the itching associated with Kimura&#x27;s disease.

=== Combination drugs ===
Loratadine/pseudoephedrine is a fixed dose combination of the drug with pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant.

=== Dosage forms ===
The medication is available in many different forms, including tablets, oral suspension, and syrups. Also available are quick-dissolving tablets.

== Contraindications ==
Loratadine is usually compatible with breastfeeding (classified category L-2 - probably compatible, by the American Academy of Pediatrics). In the U.S., it is classified as category B in pregnancy, meaning animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been conducted.

== Adverse effects ==
As a &quot;non-sedating&quot; antihistamine, loratadine causes less (but still significant, in some cases) sedation and psychomotor retardation than the older antihistamines, because it penetrates the blood/brain barrier less. Headache is also a possible side effect.

Unlike earlier-generation antihistamines, loratadine is considered largely free of antimuscarinic effects (urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision).

== Interactions ==
Substances that act as inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, cimetidine, and furanocoumarin derivatives (found in grapefruit) lead to increased plasma levels of loratadine — that is, more of the drug was present in the bloodstream than typical for a dose. This had clinically significant effects in controlled trials of 10 mg loratadine treatment. 

Antihistamines should be discontinued 48 hours before skin allergy tests, since these drugs may prevent or diminish otherwise positive reactions to dermal activity indicators.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Loratadine is a tricyclic antihistamine, which acts as a selective inverse agonist of peripheral histamine H1 receptors. The potency of second generation histamine antagonists is (from strongest to weakest) desloratadine (Ki 0.4 nM) &gt; levocetirizine (Ki 3 nM) &gt; cetirizine (Ki 6 nM) &gt; fexofenadine (Ki 10 nM) &gt; terfenadine &gt; loratadine. However, the onset of action varies significantly and clinical efficacy is not always directly related to only the H1 receptor potency, as the concentration of free drug at the receptor must also be considered. Loratadine also shows anti-inflammatory properties independent of H1 receptors. The effect is exhibited through suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and by regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, thereby regulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Loratadine is given orally, is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and has rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism; it is metabolized by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and, to a lesser extent, several others. Loratadine is almost totally (97–99%) bound to plasma proteins. Its metabolite desloratadine, which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects, binds to plasma proteins by 73–76%.

Loratadine&#x27;s peak effect occurs after 1–2 hours, and its biological half life is on average eight hours (range 3 to 20 hours) with desloratadine&#x27;s half-life being 27 hours (range 9 to 92 hours), accounting for its long-lasting effect. About 40% is excreted as conjugated metabolites into the urine, and a similar amount is excreted into the feces. Traces of unmetabolised loratadine can be found in the urine.

In structure, it is closely related to tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine, and is distantly related to the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine.

== History ==
Schering-Plough developed loratadine as part of a quest for a potential blockbuster drug: a nonsedating antihistamine. By the time Schering submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval, the agency had already approved a competitor&#x27;s nonsedating antihistamine, terfenadine (trade name Seldane), and, therefore, put loratadine on a lower priority. However, terfenadine had to be removed from the U.S. market by the manufacturer in late 1997 after reports of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking the drug.

Loratadine was approved by the FDA in 1993. The drug continued to be available only by prescription in the U.S. until it went off patent in 2002. It was then subsequently approved for over-the-counter sales. Once it became an unpatented over-the-counter drug, the price dropped significantly.

Schering also developed desloratadine (Clarinex/Aerius), which is an active metabolite of loratadine.

== Society and culture ==
===Over the counter===
In 1998, in an unprecedented action in the United States, an American insurance company, Anthem Inc., petitioned the federal Food and Drug Administration to allow loratadine and two other antihistamines to be made available over the counter (OTC) while they were still protected by patents; the administration granted the request, which was not binding on manufacturers. In the United States, Schering-Plough made loratadine available over the counter in 2002. By 2015, loratadine was available over the counter in many countries.

===Brands===
In 2017, loratadine was available under many brand names and in many forms worldwide, including several combination drug formulations with pseudoephedrine, paracetamol, betamethasone, ambroxol, salbutamol, phenylephrine, and dexamethasone.

=== Marketing ===
The marketing of the Claritin brand is important in the history of direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs.

The first television commercial for a prescription drug was broadcast in the United States in 1983, by Boots. It caused controversy. The federal Food and Drug Administration responded with strong regulations requiring disclosure of side effects and other information. These rules made pharmaceutical manufacturers balk at spending money on ads that had to highlight negative aspects.

In the mid-1990s, the marketing team for Claritin at Schering-Plough found a way around these rules. They created brand awareness commercials that never actually said what the drug was for, but instead showed sunny images, and the voiceover said such things as &quot;At last, a clear day is here&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s time for Claritin&quot; and repeatedly told viewers &quot;Ask your doctor [about Claritin].&quot; The first ads made people aware of the brand and increased prescriptions, which led Schering-Plough and others to aggressively pursue the advertising strategy.

In 1998, a 12-page one-shot comic based on the &quot;&quot; was given away to advertise Claritin. The book, written by PRIEST, penciled by Joe Staton, and inked by Mike DeCarlo, sees Tim Drake unable to perform his crime-fighting duties because hay fever and antihistamines make him drowsy. After being given a prescription for Claritin, he saved Batman from Poison Ivy.

This trend, along with advice from the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s attorneys that it could not win a First Amendment case on the issue, prompted the administration to issue new rules for television commercials in 1997. Instead of including the &quot;brief summary&quot; that took up a full page in magazine ads and would take too long to explain in a short television advertisement, drug makers were allowed to refer viewers to print ads, informative telephone lines, and websites, and to urge people to talk to their doctors if they wanted additional information.

Schering-Plough invested million in Claritin direct-to-consumer advertising in 1998 and 1999, far more than any other brand. Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry rose from million in 1995 to billion in 1998, and by 2006, was billion.

<text>Rhianus (Greek: Ῥιανὸς ὁ Κρής) was a Greek poet and grammarian, a native of Crete, friend and contemporary of Eratosthenes (275–195 BC).

==Biography==
The &quot;Suda&quot; says he was at first a slave and overseer of a palaestra, but obtained a good education later in life and devoted himself to grammatical studies, probably in Alexandria. He prepared a new recension of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, characterized by sound judgment and poetical taste. His bold atheteses are frequently mentioned in the scholia. He also wrote epigrams, eleven of which, preserved in the Greek Anthology and Athenaeus, show elegance and vivacity. But he was chiefly known as a writer of epics (mythological and ethnographical), the most celebrated of which was the &quot;Messeniaca&quot; in six books, dealing with the Second Messenian War and the exploits of its central figure Aristomenes, and used by Pausanias in his fourth book as a trustworthy authority. Other similar poems were the &quot;Achaica&quot;, &quot;Eliaca&quot;, and &quot;Thessalica&quot;. The &quot;Heracleia&quot; was a long mythological epic, probably an imitation of the poem of the same name by Panyasis, containing the same number of books (fourteen).

==Legacy==
Rhianos also wrote a number of homoerotic epigrams, and was also mentioned in one of Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy&#x27;s poems (&quot;Young Men of Sidon (A.D. 400)&quot;).

<doc id="416251" wikidata="Q314518" url="?curid=416251" title="Pausanias the Regent">
<text>Pausanias () was a Spartan regent and a general. In 479 BC, as a leader of the Hellenic League&#x27;s combined land forces, he won a pivotal victory against the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Plataea. Despite his role in ending the Second Persian invasion of Greece, Pausanias subsequently fell under suspicion of conspiring with the Persian king Xerxes I. After an interval of repeated arrests and debates about his guilt, he was starved to death by his fellow Spartans. What is known of his life is largely according to Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, Diodorus&#x27; &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; and a handful of other classical sources.

== Early life ==
Pausanias was from the royal house of the Agiads. Every male Spartan citizen earned their citizenship by dedicating their lives to their &quot;polis&quot; and its laws. Pausanias would have gone through intense military training from the age of seven and was required to be a regular soldier until the age of thirty.

==Spartan lineage==

As a son of the regent Cleombrotus and a nephew of the recently deceased warrior king, Leonidas I, Pausanias was a scion of the Spartan royal house of the Agiads, but not in the direct line of succession as he was not the first born son of one of the kings of Sparta. After Leonidas&#x27; death, while the king&#x27;s son Pleistarchus was still in his minority, Pausanias served as regent of Sparta. Pausanias was also the father of Pleistoanax who later became king. Pausanias&#x27; other sons were Cleomenes and Nasteria.

==War service==

In 479 BC, Pausanias was leader of the Spartan army alongside Euryanax, son of Dorieus, as the Agiad king of Sparta Pleistarchus, son of Leonidas I, was too young to command. Pausanias led 5000 Spartans to the aid of the league of Greek cities created to resist the Persian invasion. At the Greek encampment at Plataea 110,000 men were assembled along the Asopos River. Further down the river, Mardonius, commander of the Persian forces, stationed 300,000 Persian forces alongside 50,000 Greek allies. 

After eleven days of stalemate, Mardonius offered a challenge that was ignored by the Greeks. With no answer to his challenge, Mardonius ordered his cavalry to pollute the Asopos from which the Greeks were getting their water, so the Athenian forces decided in the night to move towards Plataea. The forces led by Pausanias headed through the ridges and foothills of the Cithaeron while the Athenian forces headed the opposite direction onto the plains. Seeing this, Mardonius thought the Athenians were fleeing, so he sent his Persian forces to charge Pausanias&#x27; army while dispatching his Greek allies to go after the Athenians. 

With the battle underway Pausanias sent a messenger to ask for Athenian aid, but they could not spare any. So Pausanias with 50,000 Lacedaemonians and 3,000 Tegeans prepared for battle at Plataea. In the subsequent Battle of Plataea, Pausanias led the Greeks to a major victory over the Persians and their allies. While the Battle of Plataea is sometimes seen as a chaotic battle, others see evidence of both Pausanias&#x27; strategic and tactical skills in delaying the engagement with the Persians until the point where Spartan arms and discipline could have maximum impact. Herodotus concluded that &quot;Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus and grandson of Anaxandridas won the most glorious victory of any known to us&quot;.

After the victories at Plataea and the subsequent Battle of Mycale, the Spartans lost interest in liberating the Greek cities of Asia Minor until it became clear that Athens would dominate the League in Sparta&#x27;s absence. Sparta then sent Pausanias back to command the Greek military.

==Suspected pact with Persia==

In 478 BC, Pausanias was accused of conspiring with the Persians and recalled to Sparta. One allegation was that after capturing Cyprus and Byzantium (478 BC), Pausanias released some of the prisoners of war who were friends and relatives of the king of Persia. Pausanias argued that the prisoners simply escaped. Another allegation was that Pausanias sent a letter via Gongylos of Eretria (Diodorus has general Artabazos I of Phrygia as a mediator) to Xerxes I saying he wished to help Xerxes and bring Sparta with the rest of Greece under Persian control. In return, Pausanias wished to marry Xerxes&#x27;s daughter. After Xerxes replied agreeing to his plans, Pausanias started to adopt Persian customs and dress like a Persian aristocrat. Due to lack of evidence, Pausanias was acquitted and left Sparta on his own accord, taking a trireme from the town of Hermione.

According to Thucydides and Plutarch, Athenians and many Hellenic League allies were displeased with Pausanias because of Pausanias&#x27; arrogance and high-handedness.

In 477 BC, the Spartans recalled Pausanias once again. Pausanias went to Kolonai in the Troad before returning to Sparta. Upon his arrival in Sparta, the ephors imprisoned Pausanias, but he was later released due to lack of sufficient evidence to convict Pausanias of disloyalty, even though some helots reported that Pausanias offered freedom if the helots joined in revolt. Later, one of the messengers Pausanias used to communicate with the Persians provided written evidence (a letter stating Pausanias&#x27; intentions) to the Spartan ephors.

Diodorus adds further detail to Thucydides&#x27; account. After the ephors were loath to believe the letter provided by the messenger, the messenger offered to produce Pausanias&#x27; acknowledgement in person. In the letter Pausanias asked the Persians to kill the messenger. The messenger and the ephors went to the Temple of Poseidon (Tainaron). The ephors concealed themselves in a tent at the shrine and the messenger waited for Pausanias. When Pausanias arrived, the messenger confronted Pausanias asking why did the letter say to kill whoever delivered the letter. Pausanias said that he was sorry and asked the messenger to forgive the mistake. Pausanias offered gifts to the messenger. The ephors heard the conversation from the tent.

Herodotus notes that the Athenians were hostile to Pausanias and wished Pausanias removed from Greek command, with his Athenian counterpart Themistocles publicly ostracising him as a threat to democracy. The historian A. R. Burn speculates that the Spartans became concerned about Pausanias&#x27; progressive views about freeing the Helots.

==Death==
According to Thucydides, Diodorus and Polyaenus, Pausanias, pursued by the ephors, took refuge in the temple of Athena &quot;of the Brazen House&quot; (Χαλκίοικος, Chalkioikos) (located in the acropolis of Sparta). Pausanias&#x27; mother Theano () immediately went to the temple, and laid a brick at the door saying: &quot;Unworthy to be a Spartan, you are not my son&quot; (according to Diodorus). Following the mother&#x27;s example, the Spartans blocked the doorway with bricks and forced Pausanias to die of starvation. After Pausanias&#x27; body was turned over to relatives for burial, the divinity through the Oracle of Delphi showed displeasure at the violation of the sanctity of supplicants. The oracle said that Athena demanded the return of the supplicant. Unable to carry out the injunction of the goddess, the Spartans set up two bronze statues of Pausanias at the temple of Athena. 

==Legacy==

Pausanias is a central figure in the &quot;Pausanias, the betrayer of his country a tragedy, acted at the Theatre Royal by His Majesties servants&quot; by Richard Norton and Thomas Southerne.

<doc id="416253" wikidata="Q457994" url="?curid=416253" title="Pausanias of Orestis">
<text>Pausanias of [[Orestis (region)|Orestis]] () was a member of Philip II of Macedon&#x27;s personal bodyguard (&quot;somatophylakes&quot;). He assassinated Philip in 336 BC. Pausanias was killed while fleeing the assassination.

==Family background==

&quot;About this time it was that Philip, king of Macedon, was treacherously assaulted and slain at Aegae by Pausanias, the son of Cerastes, who was derived from the family of Orestae&quot;.

==Motive as an assassin==
The most popular explanation of the murder comes from Diodorus Siculus, who expanded on its mention by Aristotle. According to Diodorus, the general Attalus blamed Pausanias of Orestis for the death of his friend, who confusingly was also named Pausanias. 

Pausanias of Orestis, feeling spurned, insulted his romantic rival Pausanias, Attalus&#x27;s lover, in public. To secure his public honor, Pausanias, the beloved of Attalus, endangered himself in battle while protecting the king. Devastated by his lover&#x27;s effective suicide, Attalus sought to punish Pausanias of Orestis by getting him drunk and raping him. For any number of reasons, Philip did not punish Attalus for the rape of Philip&#x27;s former lover; probably as a consolation, Pausanias of Orestis was promoted to the rank of &quot;somatophylax&quot;.

It has been supposed then that Pausanias&#x27; motive for killing Philip was at least in part due to personal anger over Philip, who was the host of the party where Pausanias was raped, not having intervened in any way, nor even having reprimanded Attalus.

===Problems with timing of the revenge===
In spite of these claims, there is a problem with the delay between the rape and the revenge: Diodorus supports the attribution of a personal motive to Pausanias, but dates the events that led to the assault on Pausanias to the time of the Illyrian Pleurias, but the last known campaign Philip conducted against the Illyria took place in 344 BC. The correspondence between these dates would put eight years between Pausanias&#x27; rape and the murder of Philip – a long wait for an ostensibly hot-blooded act of personal revenge.

==Killed while fleeing and trial of co-conspirators==
Pausanias killed Philip at the wedding ceremony of Philip&#x27;s daughter Cleopatra to Alexander I of Epirus; however, in the aftermath of the murder, whilst fleeing to the city gate in order to try to make his escape, Pausanias tripped on a vine root and was speared to death by several of Philip&#x27;s bodyguards, including Attalus, son of Andromenes the Stymphaean, Leonnatus, and Perdiccas, who were also bodyguards and friends of Alexander.

The murder was certainly premeditated, as horses were found near where Pausanias had tried to flee. At the murder trial, two other men, Heromenes and Arrhabaeus, were found guilty of conspiring with Pausanias, and executed. Leonnatus, who threw the spear that killed Pausanias, was demoted, possibly under the suspicion that he was trying to prevent the assassin from being interrogated.

==Memorial==
Philip&#x27;s son and successor, Alexander, had Pausanias&#x27;s corpse crucified. However, as soon as the new king had left Macedon, a memorial to Pausanias was erected by Olympias, Philip&#x27;s widow and Alexander&#x27;s mother.

<text>The River Brethren are a group of historically related Anabaptist Christian denominations originating in 1770, during the Radical Pietist movement among German colonists in Pennsylvania. In the 17th century, Mennonite refugees from Switzerland had settled their homes near the Susquehanna River in the northeastern United States.

Their religious guides, Jacob and John Engle, joined with the revival, and their followers were often known by their locality: a group of brethren from north of Marietta, Pennsylvania, on the east side of the Susquehanna River came to be known as the &quot;River Brethren&quot;.

The initial spiritual leader of the &quot;brethren&quot; was Martin Boehm, evangelical preacher, who was excluded from the Mennonite Church. He later became bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;River Brethren&quot; distanced themselves from Boehm and the United Brethren movement.

Influenced by the Schwarzenau Brethren (named &quot;Dunkers&quot;), the River Brethren developed a conviction that trine (triple, in allusion to the Trinity) immersion, foot washing, adherence to plain dress, the wearing of a headcovering by women and teetotalism was the scriptural form of religion. They oppose war, alcohol, tobacco, and worldly pleasures.

Nevertheless, they maintained their identity and did not join the Dunker movement. Jacob Engle is one of the early leaders who promoted trine immersion. The first confessional statement of this group was formulated around 1780.

As of 2010, there were four bodies of River Brethren in about 300 congregations:
*Brethren in Christ Church
*Calvary Holiness Church
*Old Order River Brethren (also called Yorker Brethren)
*United Zion Church

Common to the Radical Piestic tradition, the River Brethren hold experience meetings, in which &quot;members [are seen] testifying of God&#x27;s work in their lives in bringing them to salvation and daily living.&quot; When a member has a conversion experience, he or she begins taking part in the experience meeting and then requests baptism. The Old Order River Brethren continue the practice of plain dress.

Several factions of the River Brethren withdrew in the middle of the 19th century, including the Yorker Brethren and the United Zion Church, while the main body took the name Brethren in Christ, by which a group of Mennonites is also known.

There were about 11,000 members in the United States and Canada in 1992. They carry out missionary work in Asia and Africa.

<text>Pausanias ( ; ; ) was a Greek traveler and geographer of the second century AD. He is famous for his &quot;Description of Greece&quot; (, ), a lengthy work that describes ancient Greece from his firsthand observations. &quot;Description of Greece&quot; provides crucial information for making links between classical literature and modern archaeology, which is providing evidence of the sites and cultural details he mentions although knowledge of their existence may have become lost or relegated to myth or legend. 

== Biography ==
Nothing is known about Pausanias apart from what historians can piece together from his own writing. However, it is probable that he was born into a Greek family and was probably a native of Lydia in Asia Minor. From until his death around 180, Pausanias travelled throughout the mainland of Greece, writing about various monuments, sacred spaces, and significant geographical sites along the way. In writing his &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, Pausanias sought to put together a lasting written account of &quot;all things Greek&quot;, or &quot;panta ta hellenika&quot;.

=== Living in the Roman Empire ===
Being born in Asia Minor, Pausanias was of Greek heritage. He grew up and lived under the rule of the Roman Empire, but valued his Greek identity, history, and culture. He was keen to describe the glories of a Greek past that still was relevant in his lifetime, even if the country was beholden to Rome as a dominating imperial force. Pausanias&#x27;s pilgrimage throughout the land of his ancestors was his own attempt to establish a place in the world for this new Roman Greece, connecting myths and stories of ancient culture to those of his own time.

== Writing style ==
Pausanias has a straightforward and simple writing style. He is, overall, direct in his language, writing his stories and descriptions unelaborately. However, some translators have noted that Pausanias&#x27;s use of various prepositions and tenses may be confusing and difficult to render in English. For example, Pausanias may use a past tense verb rather than the present tense in some instances. Their interpretation is that he did this in order to make it seem as if he were in the same temporal setting as his audience.

Unlike a modern day travel guide, in &quot;Description of Greece&quot; Pausanias tends to elaborate with discussion of an ancient ritual or to impart a myth related to the site he is visiting. His style of writing would not become popular again until the early nineteenth century when contemporary travel guides resembled his. In the topographical aspect of his work, Pausanias makes many natural history digressions on the wonders of nature documented at the time, the signs that herald the approach of an earthquake, the phenomena of the tides, the ice-bound seas of the north, and that at the summer solstice the noonday sun casts no shadow at Syene (Aswan). 

While he never doubts the existence of the deities and heroes, he criticizes some of the myths and legends he encountered during his travels as differing from earlier cultural traditions that he relates or notes. His descriptions of monuments of art are plain and unadorned, bearing a solid impression of reality.

Pausanias is frank in acknowledging personal limitations. When he quotes information at second hand rather than relating his own experiences, he is honest about his sourcing, sometimes confirming contemporary knowledge by him that may be lost to modern researchers. 

== Modern reception ==
Until twentieth-century archaeologists concluded that Pausanias was a reliable guide to sites being excavated, classicists largely had dismissed his writings as purely literary. Following their presumed authoritative contemporary Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, classicists tended to regard him as little more than a purveyor of second-hand accounts and believed that he had not visited most of the places that he described. Modern archaeological research, however, has revealed the accuracy of information imparted by Pausanias, and even its potential as a guide for further investigations. Research into Tartessos exemplifies where his writing about it is aiding contemporary archaeological research into its existence, location, and culture.

<text>Loxapine, sold under the brand names Loxitane and Adasuve (&quot;inhalation&quot; only) among others, is a tricyclic antipsychotic medication used primarily in the treatment of schizophrenia. The medicine is a member of the dibenzoxazepine class and structurally very similar to clozapine. Several researchers have argued that loxapine, initially classified as a typical antipsychotic, behaves as an atypical antipsychotic.

Loxapine may be metabolized by &quot;N&quot;-demethylation to amoxapine, a tricyclic antidepressant.

==Medical uses==
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved loxapine inhalation powder for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults.

A brief review of loxapine found no conclusive evidence that it was particularly effective in patients with schizophrenia. A subsequent systematic review considered that the limited evidence did not indicate a clear difference in its effects from other antipsychotics.

===Available forms===
Loxapine can be taken by mouth. It is also available as an intramuscular injection and as a powder for inhalation.

==Side effects==

Loxapine can cause side effects that are generally similar to that of other antipsychotic medications. These include, e.g., gastrointestinal problems (like constipation and abdominal pain), cardiovascular problems (like tachycardia), moderate likelihood of drowsiness (relative to other antipsychotics), and movement problems (i.e. extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS]). At lower dosages its propensity for causing EPS appears to be similar to that of atypical antipsychotics. Although it is structurally similar to clozapine, it has much lower risk of agranulocytosis (which, even with clozapine, is 0.8%); however, mild and temporary fluctuations in blood leukocyte levels can occur. Abuse of loxapine has been reported.

The inhaled formulation of loxapine carries a low risk for a type of airway adverse reaction called bronchospasm that is not thought to occur when loxapine is taken by mouth.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Some scientists say loxapine is a &quot;mid-potency&quot; typical antipsychotic. However, unlike most other typical antipsychotics, it has significant potency at the 5HT2A receptor (6.6 nM), which is similar to atypical antipsychotics like clozapine (5.35 nM). The higher likelihood of EPS with loxapine, compared to clozapine, may be due to its higher affinity for the D2 receptor compared to clozapine, which has one of the lowest binding affinities at the D2 receptor of any antipsychotic.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Loxapine is metabolized to amoxapine, as well as its 8-hydroxy metabolite (8-hydroxyloxapine). Amoxapine is further metabolized to its 8-hydroxy metabolite (8-hydroxyamoxapine), which is also found in the blood of people taking loxapine. At steady-state after taking loxapine by mouth, the relative amounts of loxapine and its metabolites in the blood is as follows: 8-hydroxyloxapine &gt; 8-hydroxyamoxapine &gt; loxapine. 

The pharmacokinetics of loxapine change depending on how it is given. Intramuscular injections of loxapine lead to higher blood levels and area under the curve of loxapine than when it is taken by mouth.

==Chemistry==
Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine and is structurally very similar to clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic.

<doc id="416272" wikidata="Q8285348" url="?curid=416272" title="Wakhan Corridor">
<text>The Wakhan Corridor (; ) is a narrow strip of territory in the Badakhshan province of Afghanistan. This corridor stretches eastward, connecting Afghanistan to Xinjiang, China. It also separates the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan in the north from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan regions in Pakistan in the south, the latter of which is also part of the disputed region of Kashmir. This high mountain valley, which rises to a maximum altitude of , serves as the source of both the Panj and Pamir rivers, which converge to form the larger Amu Darya River. For countless centuries, a vital trade route has traversed this valley, facilitating the movement of travelers to and from East, South, and Central Asia.

The corridor was formed after an 1893 agreement between Mortimer Durand of the British Raj and Emir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan, creating the Durand Line. It was last conquered by the Durrani Empire in 1763. This narrow strip acted as a buffer zone between the Russian Empire and the British Empire (the regions of Russian Turkestan, now in Tajikistan and the northern part of British Raj, now in Pakistan). Its eastern end bordered China&#x27;s Xinjiang region, then claimed by the Qing dynasty.

The corridor is in the Wakhan District of Afghanistan&#x27;s Badakhshan province. As of 2020, it had 17,167 residents. The northern part of the Wakhan, populated by the Wakhi and Pamiri people, is also referred to as the &quot;Pamir&quot;. The closest major airport for the residents to use is Fayzabad Airport in the city of Fayzabad to the west, which can be reached by a road network.

==Geography==


At its western entrance, near the Afghan town of Ishkashim, the corridor is wide. The western third of the corridor varies in width () and widens to in the central Wakhan. At its eastern end, the corridor forks into two prongs that wrap around a salient of Chinese territory, forming the boundary between the two countries. The Wakhjir Pass, which is the easternmost point on the southeastern prong, is about from Ishkashim. The easternmost point of the northeastern prong is a nameless wilderness about from Ishkashim. On the Chinese side of the border is the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

The northern border of the corridor is formed by the Pamir River and Lake Zorkul in the west and the high peaks of the Pamir Mountains in the east. To the north is Tajikistan&#x27;s Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. To the south, the corridor is bounded by the high mountains of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram. Along the southern flank of the corridor, there are two mountain passes that connect the corridor to its neighbours. The Broghol pass offers access to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan, while the Irshad Pass connects the corridor to Gilgit-Baltistan. The Dilisang Pass, which also connects to Gilgit-Baltistan, is disused. The easternmost pass, as indicated above, is the Wakhjir Pass, which connects to China and is the only border connection between that country and Afghanistan.

The corridor is higher in the east than in the west; (the Wakhjir Pass is in elevation) and descends to about at Ishkashim. The Wakhjir River emerges from an ice cave on the Afghan side of the Wakhjir Pass and flows west, joining the Bozai Darya near the village of Bozai Gumbaz to form the Wakhan River. The Wakhan River then joins the Pamir River near Kala-i-Panj to form the Panj River, which then flows out of the Wakhan Corridor at Ishkashim.

The Chinese consider Chalachigu Valley, the valley east of Wakhjir Pass on the Chinese side connecting Taghdumbash Pamir, to be part of the Wakhan Corridor. The high mountain valley is about long. This valley, through which the Tashkurgan River flows, is generally about wide and less than at its narrowest point. This entire valley on the Chinese side is closed to visitors; however, local residents and herders from the area are permitted access.

==History==
Although the terrain is extremely rugged, the Corridor was historically used as a trading route between Kabul and Kashgar. It appears that Alexander the Great, Song Yun, Huisheng, Xuanzang, Marco Polo, and many others came this way. The Portuguese Jesuit priest Bento de Goes crossed from the Wakhan to China between 1602 and 1606. The area was visited under the watchful eyes of the Russians by Thomas Edward Gordon in 1874, and in 1891 by Francis Younghusband, followed by Lord Curzon in 1894. While visiting Wakhan in May 1906, Aurel Stein reported that 100 pony loads of goods crossed annually to China.

Early travellers used one of three routes:
* A northern route led up the valley of the Pamir River to Zorkul Lake, then east through the mountains to the valley of the Bartang River, then across the Sarikol Range to China.
* A southern route led up the valley of the Wakhan River to the Wakhjir Pass to China. This pass is closed for at least five months a year and is only open irregularly for the remainder.
* A central route branched off the southern route through the Little Pamir to the Murghab River valley.

From a non-Afghan point of view, the corridor is in part a political creation from The Great Game between British India and Russian Empire. In the north, an agreement between the empires in 1873 effectively split the historic region of Wakhan by making the Panj and Pamir Rivers the border between Afghanistan and the then-Russian Empire. In the south, the Durand Line Agreement of 1893 marked the boundary between British India and Afghanistan. This left a narrow strip of land ruled by Afghanistan as a buffer between the two empires, which became known as the Wakhan Corridor in the 20th century.

The corridor has been closed to regular traffic for over a century and there is no modern road. There is a rough road from Ishkashim to Sarhad-e Broghil built in the 1960s, but only rough paths beyond. These paths run some from the road end to the Chinese border at Wakhjir Pass, and further to the far end of the Little Pamir.

Jacob Townsend has speculated on the possibility of drug smuggling from Afghanistan to China via the Wakhan Corridor and Wakhjir Pass, but concluded that due to the difficulties of travel and border crossings, it would be minor compared to that conducted via Tajikistan&#x27;s Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province or through Pakistan, both having much more accessible routes into China.

The remoteness of the region has meant that, despite the long-running wars of Afghanistan since the late 1970s, the region has remained virtually untouched by conflict, and many locals, mostly composed of ethnic Pamir and Kyrgyz, are not aware of the wars in the country.

The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan asked the People&#x27;s Republic of China on several occasions to open the border in the Wakhan Corridor for economic reasons or as an alternative supply route for fighting the Taliban insurgency. The Chinese resisted, largely due to unrest in its far western province of Xinjiang, which borders the corridor. , it was reported that the United States had asked China to open the corridor.

In July, 2021, the area came under the Taliban control for the first time during the group&#x27;s summer offensive. It was reported that hundreds of ethnic Kyrgyz nomads along with their livestock attempted to flee north into Tajikistan. It is patrolled by forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which took over responsibility from the previous NATO-trained Afghan National Security Forces.

As of June 2023, there had been discussions between foreign ministers of China and Afghanistan concerning the opening of the strategically significant corridor to enhance the trade ties between Beijing and Kabul. Afghanistan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi both met on the sidelines in Tibet during the third Trans-Himalaya Forum for International Cooperation, to discuss the possibilities of improving trade ties. Though the Taliban government finished a 50-km road through the corridor to reach the Chinese border, Beijing seems disinclined to open the border, due to security concerns.

In 2024 an independent analysis conducted at the University of Texas at Austin which relied on open source intelligence suggested the corridor consists of, &quot;primarily dirt roads and footpaths that abruptly end before reaching the border.&quot;

<doc id="416276" wikidata="Q368427" url="?curid=416276" title="Shawn Graham">
<text>Shawn Michael Graham (born February 22, 1968) is a Canadian politician, who served as the 31st premier of New Brunswick from 2006 to 2010. He was elected leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party in 2002 and became premier after his party captured a majority of seats in the 2006 election. After being elected, Graham initiated a number of changes to provincial policy especially in the areas of health care, education and energy. His party was defeated in the New Brunswick provincial election held September 27, 2010, and Graham resigned as Liberal leader on November 9, 2010.

==Early career==
Graham was born in Rexton, New Brunswick, Canada and raised in a political family, with his father Alan R. Graham being the longest serving member of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. The family has ancestral homes in the communities of Five Rivers and Main River with roots going back to the early 19th century. Shawn Graham was born the year after his father&#x27;s first election as MLA for Kent County, New Brunswick.

Graham graduated from the University of New Brunswick, as an alumnus of both Harrison House and Neill House, after which he completed an education degree at St Thomas University in Fredericton. Graham spent much of his career before entering elected politics working for the province&#x27;s civil service and when his father resigned from the legislature in 1998, Shawn Graham was elected to replace him in a by-election called by Premier Camille Theriault as a member of the Liberal Party. Following the general election of 1999, the Liberals were reduced to 10 seats from 45, and by early 2001 they were down to 7 seats following the resignation of several former cabinet ministers. This gave the young politician the chance to rise to prominence.

==Leadership campaign==
Liberal leader Camille Theriault resigned in March 2001, and a leadership convention was set for May 12, 2002. Few candidates emerged for this campaign and it appeared that former cabinet minister Paul Duffie would win virtually unopposed. Graham was urged to run, and eventually entered the race with the support of Greg Byrne, a previous leadership contender, and many of the supporters of Bernard Richard, also a former leadership contender and the interim leader following the resignation of Theriault.

Surprising many pundits, Graham was successful in taking a solid lead during delegate selection meetings in February and March 2002, and, as a result, Duffie dropped out of the race. This left only fringe candidate Jack MacDougall in the race who Graham defeated by a 3 to 1 margin at the May convention.

==Toward the 2003 election==
As leader, Graham was considered a lightweight by pundits and by the governing Progressive Conservative Party, and few gave him a chance in the 2003 election.

Graham surprised pundits again during the 2003 election, running an energetic campaign and winning 26 of 55 seats, just two short of the Conservatives, and coming within 1% of the Conservatives in the popular vote. Pundits said Graham and Lord had fought the English language debate to a draw, while they viewed Graham as the winner of the French debate; this was despite the fact that Lord was a francophone and that Graham&#x27;s command of French was viewed as one of his largest liabilities. The Liberals controlled the agenda of the campaign, always keeping their three key issues: public automobile insurance, public health care and public power in the forefront of the agenda.

Graham often cited the fact that had 10 votes swung from the Conservatives to the Liberals in the riding of Kennebecasis there would have been a 27–27 tie which may have led to a Liberal minority government supported by the New Democrats whose one member would have held the balance of power. Graham was quoted on election night saying &quot;until five minutes ago, I thought I was going to be premier&quot;.

==Toward the 2006 election==
Graham&#x27;s Liberals captured a by-election victory on October 4, 2004, in Shediac-Cap-Pelé. Graham&#x27;s upward momentum continued when, in an opinion poll released on December 9, 2004, the Liberals expanded their lead over the Conservatives to 46% to 36%, but also, for the first time since Graham became leader, he was the preferred choice of New Brunswickers for premier beating the incumbent Bernard Lord 34% to 27%.

In the spring session of the legislature, Graham attempted to pass a snap motion of no confidence during his speech on the budget. There was brief excitement on Liberal benches as less than half of the government caucus was present for Graham&#x27;s speech, however the speaker ruled that the vote would be held along with the main budget motion at the end of the following week. Graham was criticised because when the vote was held two of his members were absent. Graham defended their absence arguing that, because New Democratic Party leader Elizabeth Weir was also absent, it was impossible to defeat the government, and he did not see the need to whip his members.

Graham&#x27;s victory in a subsequent by-election on November 14, 2005, in Saint John Harbour with candidate Ed Doherty, as well as his continued lead in opinion polls, quieted any criticism of his leadership for a time. In 2006, however, following the brief minority government when Michael Malley left the government caucus for 6 weeks, Graham took a very aggressive stance towards forcing an election. A prolonged dispute over the functioning of legislature was undertaken, crippling most of the business of the House. Graham and the Liberals were criticized for this and, for the first time in over 2 years, in June 2006 the PCs regained the lead in opinion polls and Lord took a double-digit lead in preference for Premier.

Throughout the term that began following the 2003 election, Graham has worked hard to portray himself and his caucus as a &quot;government-in-waiting&quot;. From the Lord government&#x27;s introduction of controversial health reforms in the spring of 2004, Graham said he would force an election at his earliest opportunity.

His strategy was to focus heavily on policy, and his party introduced a record number of pieces of legislation for an opposition party.

In addition to his legislative agenda, Graham and the Liberals launched a series of regional policy meetings culminating in a policy convention in the fall of 2005. Graham also convened a meeting of all of the Liberal leaders of the Maritime provinces to discuss common policy objectives, engaged in several tours of the province on particular policy issues and took several trips to Ottawa to meet with federal ministers on various issues.

In early 2006, Graham set out on a tour of the northeast United States, Washington, D.C. and the Maritimes to promote New Brunswick as an &quot;energy hub&quot; and his idea of building a second reactor at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station.

On February 17, 2006, Bernard Lord&#x27;s government was reduced to a minority when Michael Malley crossed the floor to sit as an independent. Graham said, if Malley would support the Liberals, he would have brought down the government on an April 7, 2006 budget vote forcing an early election. Malley was subsequently elected speaker however, creating an equality of government and opposition members; the April 7 vote came to a tie which was broken in favour of the government by Malley in accordance with tradition.

Following this, Malley rejoined the Conservative caucus from the speaker&#x27;s chair. This created some controversy and Graham&#x27;s Liberals held up some business in the House as a procedural stalemate ensued for some weeks. Finally the Conservative and Liberal House Leaders signed an agreement on May 31, 2006, which laid out a detailed plan for the conduct of the business of the House and which seemingly guaranteed that the next election would be held on Lord&#x27;s preferred date of October 15, 2007. This protracted procedural battle did not seem to go well for the Liberals when, in an opinion poll released on June 12, 2006, the Tories took the lead over the Liberals for the first time in any poll since August 2003.

===The election campaign===
Bernard Lord announced on August 10, 2006, that an election would be held on September 18, 2006, due to the pending resignation of Conservative MLA Peter Mesheau from the legislature that would have created another minority government.

Graham had already started a campaign in earnest, having announced his energy platform on August 8 and having nominated several candidates already. With the election call, the party gave him the authority to appoint the 25 MLAs seeking re-election as candidates bringing the total number of nominated Liberal candidates to 30 of 55. Graham said he would pursue education, economic development and energy as three key issues during the campaign.

Graham stated that if he did not win the election, he would resign as Liberal leader.

Graham won the 2006 election by taking 29 out of the 55 seats in the legislature despite the Liberals narrowly trailing the Progressive Conservatives in the popular vote.

==Premier of New Brunswick==
Graham was elected premier under a platform called the &quot;Charter for Change&quot;, he pledged to focus on &quot;the three Es&quot;: energy, education and the economy. He also pledged to make the province self-sufficient, that is to no longer depend on federal equalization payments, by 2026.

Though they won the election with a slight deficit in the popular vote, upon taking office, the Liberals surged in popularity. In December 2006, a poll showed the Liberals had surged to a lead of 65–27 in opinion polls, thereafter polls have showed the Liberals ahead by a minimum of 17%.

Graham&#x27;s Liberals maintained the lead in a number of polls despite addressing a number of controversial issues such as post-secondary education reform, French second-language education, a bailout of a credit union and the restructuring of the province&#x27;s public health care administration.

===Transition and day-one actions===
On September 20, 2006, Graham appointed a transition team to begin to transfer power headed by Doug Tyler. Graham, as New Brunswick&#x27;s 31st Premier, and the rest of the cabinet were sworn in by Lieutenant-Governor Herménégilde Chiasson on October 3, 2006.

On his first day in office, Graham acted on five campaign promises. His government cut the excise tax on gasoline by 3.8 cents per litre, moved nursing home payments from an assets-based test to an income-based test, provided students with a reduced tuition of $2000 for their first year in university, provided the City of Saint John with a memorandum of understanding to provide a third of required monies for the clean up of Saint John harbour and established separate ministers for Agriculture &amp; Aquaculture, Fisheries, Housing and Seniors. Additionally, on its first day in office, it pledged $2 million to assist in maintaining ferry service from Saint John to Digby, Nova Scotia.

In addition to being Premier and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs (a post often held by premiers in Canada), Graham took on the role of Minister of Wellness, Culture and Sport. Graham, who has a background in athletics competing in the 1985 Canada Games for New Brunswick in track and field, wanted to take the portfolio to ensure it was a priority in large part to fight childhood obesity in the province, which is the highest in the country.

===First year (2006–07)===
On October 12, 2006, Graham announced several senior appointments. He appointed a president of NB Liquor and deputy ministers for the Department of Energy and the Department of Justice and Consumer Affairs to replace Conservative political appointees who had resigned when Graham took office. He also appointed former cabinet minister Bernard Thériault as his chief of staff and his former Opposition chief of staff Chris Baker to be secretary of the Policy and Priorities Committee of Cabinet.

Early in its mandate, the government implemented increases to the amount of care received by nursing home and homecare clients. It also appointed Bernard Richard as Child and Youth Advocate, a position which had been vacant since its creation in 2005 as a result of a then-opposition Liberal-sponsored bill. In December 2006, the province announced an agreement with private auto insurance companies that would see some restructuring of regulations and an average decrease of 13.5% in insurance rates by March 1, 2007. The province also appointed several commissions to investigate larger issues: a Community Non-Profit Task Force, a Self-Sufficiency Task Force and a Commission on Post-Secondary Education. The Liberals however cancelled a tax rebate on energy costs brought forward by the previous government which they had said they would maintain. The Liberals defended the move saying that the Conservatives had left the province&#x27;s finances &quot;in a downward spiral&quot; and that the program was bad policy because it didn&#x27;t encourage energy conservation.

On March 13, 2007, Graham&#x27;s Finance Minister Victor Boudreau introduced the government&#x27;s first budget. While the budget was balanced, despite warnings months earlier from an independent auditor that the province was facing a massive deficit, and increased spending in priority areas, it was criticized by the opposition for having raised some taxes. Boudreau defended the increases saying &quot;we all enjoy lower taxes, but when the level of taxation is insufficient to ensure the continued provision of essential public services, it needs to be addressed.&quot;

The spring of 2007 saw the Liberal majority grow by six; they added a seat when Chris Collins won a by-election in Moncton East, the seat vacated when former Premier Bernard Lord stepped down from provincial politics. A short time later, Tory MLAs and spouses Wally Stiles and Joan MacAlpine-Stiles crossed the floor to give the Liberals 32 seats, compared to 23 for the opposition.

The report of the Self-Sufficiency Task Force was released in May will 91 recommendations covering 11 themes, 80 of which were to be acted upon within one year.

During a marathon 79-day spring sitting of the legislature, Graham&#x27;s government unveiled an education plan called &quot;When Kids Come First&quot; the stated aim of which is to build the best education system in Canada. The government began a refurbishment of its Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station, launched a feasibility study into building a second reactor there, and began projects to add 300 megawatts of wind power to the province&#x27;s electric grid. It also invested $40 million into affordable housing and opened 125 new nursing home beds. Additionally, Graham and his Environment Minister Roland Haché launched a Climate Change Action Plan, a five-year strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the province.

Over the summer, a number of major economic projects were announced by Graham including a $1.7 billion potash mine near Sussex and a $21.5 million steel fabrication plan and centre of excellence in Miramichi.

In August, Graham hosted all 13 Canadian premiers and territorial leaders in Moncton as incoming chair of the Council of the Federation. The meeting focused on issues of energy and climate change.

In September, the report of the Commission on Post-Secondary Education was released. It contained a wide-number of recommendations meant to be considered together as a comprehensive reform package. The authors indicated in their submission to government that:

:&quot;Due to the complexities and interrelationships involved, this is a document that cannot be easily scanned. Readers will need to spend time understanding the dynamics and relevance of the issues raised. At the risk of stating the obvious, the recommendations are also highly interrelated and should not be considered discrete advice. Such an approach could result in the essence of the report being misinterpreted.&quot;

The day the report was presented to government, Post-Secondary Education Minister Ed Doherty was quoted at the top of a news release saying, &quot;these are only recommendations from an independent commission and final decisions haven&#x27;t been made yet by our government&quot; and that government would take time to evaluate them before making any decisions.

The most controversial proposal was to convert the Saint John campus of the University of New Brunswick, and the Edmundston and Shippagan campuses of the University of Moncton into &quot;polytechnics.&quot; Controversy surrounded the Saint John school in particular. A month later the government said it would set aside the possibility of UNB Saint John losing its status as a &#x27;university&#x27; and would refer the report to a working group for further study. The government would go on to announce in January that UNBSJ would retain its liberal arts program and its association with UNB and the working group reported back to government in May, with its findings and government&#x27;s response being made public in June.

===Second year (2007–08)===
Shortly after the first anniversary of his election, Graham shuffled his cabinet. He added two new ministers: outgoing speaker Eugene McGinley and Wally Stiles. Five other ministers were affected by the shuffle. Two ministers who had multiple portfolios ceded some of their responsibilities: the premier ceded his responsibility for the Department of Wellness, Culture and Sport; and Finance Minister Victor Boudreau gave up responsibility for the Department of Local Government. Three other ministers, namely Hédard Albert, Carmel Robichaud and Mary Schryer changed portfolios, including a promotion for Schryer who moved from minister of state to full minister. There was another minor adjustment to cabinet in January 2008 when Roly MacIntyre resigned from cabinet, his portfolios were taken on by other ministers in the cabinet.

In January, Graham unveiled a new brand called &quot;Be... in this place&quot; to give a common look and feel to provincial activities. A new brand was the first recommendation of the Self-Sufficiency Task Force. In February, the province unveiled its population growth strategy called &quot;Be Our Future&quot; setting out the plan to attract 100,000 new people to the province by 2026 as part of achieving self-sufficiency.

In March, the government tabled its second balanced budget which included record increases to the health and education budgets and a tuition freeze for students at the province&#x27;s four public universities.

In March and April, the province unveiled its plans for healthcare. A dramatic change to the administration of the province&#x27;s public healthcare moved the province from eight regional health authorities to two with a new crown corporation to handle non-clinical functions on behalf of both authorities. A new provincial health plan, was also launched with plans to invest over $154 million in addition to regular inflationary increases over four years. The plan included plans for new community health centres, broader addiction treatment services, HPV vaccinations for school children, the introduction of midwifery to the public health system, enabling pharmacists to write some prescriptions and the hiring of 100 new doctors and 40 nurse practitioners.

Much of the spring and summer of Graham&#x27;s second year in office was dominated by the debate of French second-language programs. In February, a commission recommended that government should scrap early immersion in favour of a universal curriculum in elementary school which would see anglophone students learn in their mother tongue from kindergarten through Grade 4 and then all study French through an intensive program in Grade 5 before choosing between an immersion or non-immersion program. The commission said that this was the best route because under the existing model, over 93% of students with special learning needs were being streamed into non-immersion classrooms. In March, Minister of Education Kelly Lamrock announced that the government would move forward with the recommendations for the reasons stated by the commissioners. Lamrock said the changes would further promote bilingualism by giving all students access to a quality second-language program noting that the early immersion model had been implemented in a time when there was resistance to bilingualism and that it only worked well for small groups of students, not the large groups that were now interested in becoming bilingual. There was considerable opposition to this move, including from the province&#x27;s official languages commissioner and ombudsman. In June, the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench ruled on a case brought forward by opponents to the changes. The court sided with the opponents on one ground that the government had implied that there would be two months of consultation on the commission report, when there had only been two weeks. Though the court ruled in favour of the government on two other grounds, it quashed the decision saying that the government could go forward with the changes as is but first must consult the public. Following an additional six weeks of consultation, on August 5 the government announced a revised model to be implemented in September 2008, which would provide a &quot;universal learning environment&quot; including exposure to French culture from kindergarten through Grade 2 projected to start in 2009, an optional entry to immersion in Grade 3 projected to start in 2010, further French instruction for non-immersion students in grades 3 through 5 with another optional entry to late immersion in Grade 6. The revised program has been generally well received.

In June, the working group that had been appointed to review the Commission on Post-Secondary Education reported back to government. Graham announced that the government would forgo the recommendations about creating polytechnics, but would follow through on recommendations to greater integrate the universities and colleges in the province, and promised at least $90 million in new money. In July, Graham committed $20 million to the restoration of the Petitcodiac River. The river system had been changed by the construction of a causeway in the 1960s.

===Third year (2008–09)===
Graham began the third year of his mandate in October 2008.

From October 17 to 19, Graham attended the 12th Francophonie Summit in Quebec City to discuss four major issues: democracy and rule of law; economic governance and solidarity; environment (water management and forest management); and the French language. In addition to the official deliberations, New Brunswick helped organize a cultural event called Passion Francophonie which featured artists from Madagascar, France, Vietnam, Quebec, and New Brunswick; New Brunswick also hosted a breakfast for heads of government that featured New Brunswick food products.

Graham participated in a Council of the Federation trade mission to China from November 2 to 7. The mission yielded $75.5 million in new business for New Brunswick companies on its first full day in China. A by-election was held in the conservative riding of New Maryland-Sunbury West on November 3, 2008. Although the Liberals increased their share of the vote by nearly 3%, they were unable to capture the riding.

On November 12, Graham announced a second major cabinet shuffle. Two ministers - Eugene McGinley and Carmel Robichaud - were dropped from cabinet, while three new individuals joined the cabinet - Rick Brewer, Brian Kenny and Bernard LeBlanc. Three other ministers changed portfolios, including: Donald Arseneault, Ed Doherty and Wally Stiles.

The third legislative session of Graham&#x27;s government began with a throne speech on November 25, 2008. The speech focussed on &quot;keeping commitments, carefully managing through the current economic downturn, and a renewed focus on and commitment to achieving self-sufficiency.&quot;

On the second day of the session, Graham&#x27;s government introduced a 100-page bill called the &quot;Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act&quot; to change all provincial laws making same-sex common law couples equal to opposite-sex couples, in accordance with the M. v. H. decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 1999. The previous Conservative government, in office from 1999 to 2006, did not introduce such legislation.

On December 3, 2008, Graham&#x27;s finance minister, Victor Boudreau, gave an economic and fiscal update in light of the economic situation. The statement indicated that the 2008-09 fiscal year would likely see a $285 million deficit, instead of the $19 million surplus that had been projected. In order to stimulate the economy, the government announced it would bring forward a two-year capital spending plan that would total more than $1.2 billion, including the largest capital budget in the province&#x27;s history for 2009–10 to be tabled on December 9, 2008. Other measures announced to control spending and ensure economic growth in light of the economic situation were: a review of all government programs, providing capital to small, medium and large businesses, renewing a commitment to tax reform that will include &quot;lowering personal and corporate income taxes&quot;. Additionally, Boudreau indicated the salaries for members of the legislature would be frozen for one year &quot;to lead by example.&quot;

In Graham&#x27;s 2009 state of the province address, he pledged to make the economy his government&#x27;s top priority and amended the three Es from his campaign platform (formerly education, energy and the economy) to read, &quot;the economy, the economy, and the economy.&quot; He also pledged that his promised changes to the tax system would mean more than $100 million in savings to New Brunswickers in the coming year.

In early March, Graham&#x27;s party won a by-election in Restigouche-La-Vallée on a swing of nearly 15 per cent. Since the previous election, this was the third by-election, all held in ridings previously held by the Conservative opposition. Graham&#x27;s Liberals improved their showing in all three ridings, and won two counting this one.

On March 17, Graham joined his finance minister Victor Boudreau to introduce the budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year. The budget included $144 million in personal and corporate tax reductions and a pledge to lower taxes by a total of over $380 million over four years, and budget deficit of $741 million. It centred around the so-called &quot;Plan for a Stronger Economy&quot; which included the tax cuts, a four-year plan to return the province to balanced budgets, the $1.2 billion in infrastructure spending previously announced in December, investments in priority areas with cuts in other areas to ensure &quot;responsible management&quot; of government expenditure. Savings were released by instituting a two-year wage freeze for all government employees, the elimination of 700 civil service positions and the elimination of some services, most controversially the elimination of three ferries in the lower Saint John River Valley. Later there was also controversy surrounding some cuts to education services—despite an increase of funding to the education department, and a dispute with the province&#x27;s physicians over their payment. The province&#x27;s tax reforms attracted positive national attention, however, with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the National Post newspaper, and the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies all spoke on it favourably.

In May 2009, Atcon, a long-standing business in the Miramichi region, fell into financial difficulty. Both political parties in the legislature agreed that some sort of assistance should be made to the company, though there was disagreement on the details. In June 2009, Graham&#x27;s government granted $50 million in loan guarantees, which was in addition to previous assistance granted to the company totalling about $20 million which had been provided by governments of both political stripes over the years. The company eventually failed anyway and the Progressive Conservatives filed an allegation of conflict of interest against Graham which was not resolved until after his government left office.

On June 22, 2009, Graham undertook another cabinet shuffle. In the most significant shuffle since taking office, Graham moved all of his major ministers. There were new ministers for the three largest departments in government – Health, Education and Social Development – as well as the important portfolios of Finance, Attorney General and Business New Brunswick.

===Fourth year (2009–10)===
In October 2009 Premier Graham announced a Memorandum of Understanding between the provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec proposing to sell the New Brunswick Power electricity generation, transmission and distribution network to the Quebec government-owned Hydro-Québec electricity corporation. Under this plan Hydro-Québec would pay the $4.8 billion debt of NB Power and provide rate savings valued at $5.6 billion by freezing New Brunswick residential electricity rates for five years and matching industrial rates to Quebec for five years, while rising both at the rate of inflation thereafter. The plan met with some support and some opposition in New Brunswick with opinion polls showing the Liberals losing support because of the proposed agreement, Graham hoped to finalize the deal before March 31, 2010, when a 3% rate increase was scheduled. The opposition Conservatives were very critical of the proposal, though some accused them of hypocrisy for having tried to sell major NB Power assets when they were in power.

On December 1, 2009, Graham&#x27;s new finance minister Greg Byrne introduced his first budget. It showed the deficit for 2009–10 had come in roughly as expected and that the 2010-11 would be in the same range - about $750 million. The province also revised its target date to return to balanced budgets to 2014–15 from 2012 to 2013, and boosted its two-year stimulus package to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion.

On January 4, 2010, a minor cabinet shuffle was precipitated by the resignation from cabinet of Justice Minister Mike Murphy for personal reasons. Local Government Minister Bernard LeBlanc replaced Murphy as justice minister, while his other responsibilities - those of attorney general and government house leader - went to Kelly Lamrock and Greg Byrne respectively. Backbencher Chris Collins joined the cabinet to replace LeBlanc as local government minister.

On September 27, 2010, Shawn Graham lost his bid to be re-elected as Premier (13 to 42) to provincial PC leader David Alward, but remained MLA for Kent riding. He stepped down as leader of the party on November 9, 2010; Victor Boudreau was selected as the party&#x27;s interim leader the following day.

==Later career==

After resigning as leader of the Liberal Party, Graham continued as a member of the legislative assembly until 2013. Graham said he remained in office in part to allow for the completion of an investigation that had been launched by a political opponent about the granting of financial support to the Atcon companies. The New Brunswick &quot;Members&#x27; Conflict of Interest Act&quot; only applies to sitting politicians, and others have left office before investigations were able to conclude.

After nearly three years of investigation, an 80-page report was issued by the provincial conflict commissioner in February 2013. The report found that Graham&#x27;s father had a business interest in Atcon and that &quot;the furthering of his father’s private interest although serious, was incidental to the financial aid&quot; Graham&#x27;s government had granted to Atcon. Because Graham had not excused himself from meetings where assistance to Atcon was discussed, the commissioner fined him $3,500, less than the $8,000 to $16,000 proposed by the commissioners&#x27; counsel.

Graham stepped down as MLA for the riding of Kent on March 11, 2013, and paid the fine even though his resignation meant he had no legal obligation to do so. The opposing Progressive Conservative party said that the ensuing by-election would be a chance for voters to issue their own &quot;verdict&quot; on the Atcon case. Graham&#x27;s successor as Liberal leader, Brian Gallant, won the by-election by more than a 2-to-1 margin over the New Democratic Party with the governing Progressive Conservatives coming a distant third with less than 14% of the vote.
