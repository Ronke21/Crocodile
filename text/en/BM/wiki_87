<text>The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) is a Jewish human rights organization established in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier. The center is known for Holocaust research and remembrance, hunting Nazi war criminals, combating anti-Semitism, tolerance education, defending Israel, and its Museum of Tolerance.

The center publishes a seasonal magazine, &quot;In Motion&quot;. The center has close ties to public and private agencies, and regularly meets with elected officials of the United States and foreign governments and with diplomats and heads of state. It is accredited as a non-governmental organization (NGO) at the United Nations, UNESCO, and the Council of Europe. The center is named in honor of Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal had nothing to do with its operation or activities other than giving its name, but he remained supportive of it. &quot;I have received many honors in my lifetime,&quot; Wiesenthal once said, &quot;when I die, these honors will die with me. But the Simon Wiesenthal Center will live on as my legacy.&quot;

== Leadership and organization ==
The center is headed by Jim Berk as CEO since January 2024, Rabbi Abraham Cooper the associate dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda and Rabbi Meyer May, the executive director. Marvin Hier&#x27;s wife, Marlene Hier, is the Director of Membership development. Shimon Samuels is the Director for International Relations. In 2016, the center had 136 employees. The headquarters of the Simon Wiesenthal Center is in Los Angeles. However, there are also international offices located in New York City, Miami, Toronto, Jerusalem, Paris, Chicago, and Buenos Aires.

== Finances ==
In its 2013 survey of Jewish charity compensation, the Jewish-American magazine &quot;The Forward&quot; singled out Hier as &quot;by far the most overpaid CEO&quot; earning double the amount of what would be expected. He and his family members received nearly $1.3 million in 2012 from the center. In 2017, &quot;The Forward&quot; again rated Hier as the most overpaid Jewish charity leader with a total salary of $818,148. Family members of his earned over $600,000 from the organization.

According to Charity Navigator the center&#x27;s total revenue and expenses was $25,359,129 and $26,181,569 in 2018. 52.8% of the revenue came from contributions, gifts and grants, 31.4% from fundraising events and 15.8% from government grants.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Hier was born and raised in New York City and became an ordained rabbi at the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. At the age of 22 he moved to Vancouver, Canada and became the rabbi of the city&#x27;s orthodox synagogue. He became friends with the mostly non-Orthodox Belzberg family who would help him fund the Simon Wiesenthal Center. In 1977, he moved to Los Angeles and bought a building on Pico Boulevard using a $500,000 donation from Samuel Belzberg which was matched with another half a million from Toronto-based real estate maven Joseph Tannenbaum. In the building he founded a yeshiva, a religious Jewish school, today known as Yeshiva University High Schools of Los Angeles, and a small Holocaust museum, with Belzberg as founding chairman. Famous Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal was convinced to bless the museum with his name. Edward Norden, writing for &quot;Commentary&quot;, dismissed the museum as &quot;a low-tech affair fashioned by and for Jews and holding nothing against the Gentiles back—an outsized portrait of Pius XII was given a prominent place among pictures of those who &#x27;didn&#x27;t care.&#x27; The message was that Jews have enemies, murderous enemies, and should look out.&quot; Hier, a skillful fundraiser, networked with the Hollywood célébrité, local politicians, and businessmen and raised large sums of money which he used to expand his operations.

=== Museum of Tolerance ===

In 1985, the center was incorporated separately from the yeshiva in order to bid for state funding for the construction of a bigger Holocaust museum. This bid was vociferously opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anti-Defamation League and secular Jewish organizations due to the unclear separation between the yeshiva and the center. At the time, the same persons sat on the board of both the center and the yeshiva.

Another reason for the opposition was that Los Angeles already had a Holocaust museum; the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial Museum (later renamed to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust) and Hier&#x27;s bid was seen as undue competition by parts of Los Angeles Jewish community which also criticized him for exploiting the memory of the Holocaust. Fred Diament, president of the Holocaust survivor group 1939 Club who helped establish the competing Martyrs&#x27; Memorial, blasted the organization in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1985: 

Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, director of the Hillel Jewish Student Union at UCLA, in an interview with the same paper in 1990 claimed that he confronted Hier about the unwelcome competition:

Wiesenthal himself, however, was fully supportive of Hier&#x27;s museum. Despite the opposition and by using the connections with the Los Angeles elite Hier had formented, he secured a grant for $5 million from the state. According to Karl Katz, designer of the museum, over 10,000 Californians sent messages to the state Senate in support of the grant. The Center later netted an additional $5 million through a bill introduced by Democratic Representative Henry Waxman. One reason for the approval of the funding was that Hier in 1985 had promised to commemorate the Armenian genocide in the museum. California&#x27;s governor at the time George Deukmejian was of Armenian descent and the legislation which approved the funding explicitly referred to the Armenian genocide: &quot;which have so adversely affected the lives and well-being of so many human beings, through such mass murder as the Armenian genocide and the Nazi Holocaust and other genocides.&quot; In interviews Hier repeatedly assured people that the Armenian genocide would be featured.

This drew the ire of some parts of Los Angeles Jewish community because of the precarious situation for Jews in Turkey, which doesn&#x27;t recognize the Armenian genocide. Hier took the position that the Armenian genocide did happen and that it should be included, regardless of any diplomatic issues. Michael Berenbaum of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington praised Hier for not allowing the &quot;rewriting of history to the exclusion of Armenian genocide.&quot; But to the Armenian community&#x27;s dismay, the exhibits commemorating the Armenian genocide were removed in 1997. The museum finally opened in 1993, in an 8-story building on Pico Boulevard opposite to Hier&#x27;s yeshiva. It was given the English name the Museum of Tolerance and the Hebrew name Beit HaShoah, the House of the Holocaust. The total construction costs amounted to some $50 million, with the majority of the funding coming from donations and $10 million from government funding. Today the museum hosts 350,000 visitors annually, among them 110,000 schoolchildren. Branches of the Museum have been built in New York and Jerusalem. The Center and its Museum of Tolerance is one of many partner organizations of the Austrian Service Abroad (Auslandsdienst) and the corresponding Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service (Gedenkdienst).

=== Rapid growth ===
From the very start, the center grew rapidly. In 1985 the museum claimed to have 25,000 visitors annually and the center 273,000 contributing members, including 47,000 Californians. Between 1984 and 1990 the center published seven volumes of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual, that focused on the scholarly study of the Holocaust. In 1990, it had become one of the largest Jewish organizations in America with 380,000 members. The same year, Sheldon Teitelbaum and Tom Waldman profiled Hier in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, describing him as the &quot;unorthodox rabbi&quot;, and characterized his success as follows:

Between 1984 and 1990 the center published seven volumes of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual, that focused on the scholarly study of the Holocaust, broadly defined. This series is .
The archives of the center in Los Angeles have grown to a collection of about 50,000 volumes and non-print materials. Moreover, the archives incorporates photographs, diaries, letters, artifacts, artwork and rare books, which are available to researchers, students and the general public.

== Branches ==

=== New York branch ===
In 2005, the New York branch of the Museum of Tolerance opened to the public under the name &quot;New York Tolerance Center&quot;, providing tolerance training to police officers, prosecutors, schoolteachers and teenagers. In its first four years, over 10,000 people, mostly law enforcement officers, underwent tolerance training at the facility. In April 2016, the New York City Council stopped funding the Tolerance Center following the arrest of a former board member who has been accused of raising $20 million from a city correctional officers&#x27; union through kickbacks. The Center stated that the member had resigned from its board on June 15, and that it was unaware of any unethical or illegal activities regarding its donors.

=== Jerusalem branch ===

A branch museum in Jerusalem, expected to be completed in 2021, sparked protests from the city&#x27;s Muslim population. The museum is being built on a thousand-year-old Muslim graveyard called the Mamilla Cemetery, much of which has already been paved over. The complaints were rejected by Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court, leading to a demonstration by hundreds of people in November 2008. On November 19, 2008, a group of US Jewish and Muslim leaders sent a letter to the Wiesenthal Center urging it to halt the construction of the museum on the site.

As of February 2010, the Museum of Tolerance&#x27;s plan for construction has been fully approved by Israeli courts and is proceeding at the compound of Mamilla Cemetery. The courts ruled that the compound had been neglected as a spiritual site by the Muslim community, in effect not functioning as a cemetery for decades (while simultaneously used for other purposes), and was thus &quot;mundra&quot;, i.e. abandoned, under Muslim laws.

=== Search for Nazi war criminals ===
The center used to hunt Nazi war criminals, often in collaboration with Simon Wiesenthal. Its first claim to fame came in 1979 when it successfully petitioned West Germany to revoke a statute of limitations on Nazi war criminals. Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, is the coordinator of Nazi war crimes research worldwide for the Wiesenthal Center and he is also the author of its annual (since 2001) &quot;Status Report&quot; on the worldwide investigation and prosecution of Nazi war criminals which includes a &quot;most wanted&quot; list of Nazi war criminals.

In November 2005, the Simon Wiesenthal Center gave the name of four suspected former Nazi criminals to German authorities. The names were the first results of Operation Last Chance, a drive launched that year by the center to track down former Nazis for World War II-era crimes before they die of old age. According to the center, about 2,000 Nazi war criminals entered Canada illegally by providing false documents, but the Canadian government largely ignored their presence until the mid-1980s. It also claimed that when they were exposed, the government made their deportations harder to carry out. One example is Vladimir Katriuk, who the center said was involved in the Katyn massacre in 1943 and who came to Canada in 1951. Katriuk, who denied the allegations, died in 2015 before he could be extradited to Russia to face charges.

=== Black Hebrew Israelite awareness ===
In 2022, the Center published their first report about the rise of the anti-semitic Black Hebrew Israelite movement. The report profiled the Israelites&#x27; belief system, in the wake of the &quot;Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America&quot; documentary, promoted by NBA star Kyrie Irving. The documentary contained antisemitic tropes, Holocaust denial, and claims of an international Jewish conspiracy. The center reported that individuals motivated by Black Hebrew Israelitism committed five religiously motived murders between 2019 and 2022. The report stated that BHIs believe that Jewish people are &quot;imposters&quot;, who have &quot;stolen&quot; Black American&#x27;s true racial and religious identity. Black Hebrew Israelites promulgate the anti-semitic Khazar conspiracy theory about Jewish origins. In a 2019 survey of 1,019 African Americans, 4% of respondents self-identified as Black Hebrew Israelites.

==Moriah Films==
Moriah Films, also known as the Jack and Pearl Resnick Film Division of the SWC, was created to produce theatrical documentaries to educate both national and international audiences, with a focus on contemporary human rights and ethical issues and Jewish experience. Two films produced by the division, &quot;Genocide&quot; and &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; have received the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Moriah Films has worked with numerous actors to narrate their productions. Including but not limited to Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Douglas, Nicole Kidman, Morgan Freeman, Patrick Stewart, and Sandra Bullock.

==Top ten anti-Semitic/anti-Israel slurs==
Since 2010, the center has published annual lists of individuals who they consider to have uttered the most antisemitic or anti-Israel &quot;slurs&quot; for the year. The rankings have often been criticized for labeling criticism of Israel anti-Semitism. Examples include Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström&#x27;s call for an investigation into &quot;extra-judicial killings&quot; by Israeli police during the Knife intifada in 2015 which the center ranked as the eight worst slur that year, and Berlin&#x27;s mayor Michael Müller who the center considered placing on the list in 2016 for &quot;mainstreaming the BDS movement that never contributes to the daily life of Palestinians.&quot; The inclusion of German journalist Jakob Augstein on their 2012 list sparked a controversy in German media.
The center&#x27;s 2021 edition of its &quot;Global Anti-Semitism Top Ten&quot; list included in seventh place the entire country of Germany, particularly , the commissioner against antisemitism of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, alleging that he had liked a 2019 Facebook post equating Zionism with Nazism. Blume told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in an interview that he has no recollection of liking any such post, and that it was possible that the post had been edited after he had liked it; he also described himself as a &quot;friend and ally&quot; of Israel who believes that &quot;Zionism is fully legitimate&quot; and that &quot;anti-Zionism equates [to] antisemitism, pure and simple&quot;. The European Union&#x27;s coordinator for combatting antisemitism, Katharina von Schnurbein, said that by including Blume on its list, the center &quot;discredit[s] the invaluable legacy of Simon Wiesenthal&quot;. Blume&#x27;s inclusion was also criticised by representatives of Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s Jewish community and the Central Council of Jews in Germany. In January 2023 the Managing editor of the biggest Jewish Newspaper in Germany, &quot;jüdische Allgemeine&quot;, criticised the Wiesenthal Center for integrating Christoph Heusgen, Jakob Augstein and Michael Blume in its lists and for naming them next to terrorists and anti-Semites. He wrote with regard to the Wiesenthal Center and its lists: The fight against anti-Semitism is too serious to be pursued in the way the Wiesenthal Center unfortunately did with the list. [...] Truth instead of fake news: For Simon Wiesenthal, that was a matter of course. Obviously, this is only a very limited part of the Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s self-image.

== Humanitarian Award dinners ==
The center hosts dinners during which it awards people the prizes Humanitarian Award and the less prestigious Medal of Valor. It is one of the center&#x27;s main fundraising events. The winners of the Humanitarian Award for each year were:

== Official statements and controversies ==
Controversies include aiding Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder in a lawsuit against the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;.

=== German reunification ===
Hier was skeptical of the reunification of Germany because he feared that anti-Semitism might reemerge in a reunified Germany. On February 9, 1990, he sent a letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and in it, he expressed his fears: &quot;I am not among those in the cheering section applauding the rush towards German reunification.&quot; In his reply to Hier&#x27;s letter three weeks later, Kohl expressed his disappointment &quot;at how little many opponents of German unity take note of the fact that for decades now especially the young generation in the free part of Germany has been informed without any taboos of the causes and consequences of the National Socialist tyranny: in schools, universities, church or other educational institutions and the media.&quot;

He added that East Germans are &quot;immune to any new totalitarian temptations&quot; and he also emphasized the fact that hate crimes are punishable with fines or prison sentences. However, the last communist premier of East Germany, Hans Modrow, wrote a letter to Hier and in it, he wrote that Hier&#x27;s fears were &quot;definitely justified in the light of the formation of a multi-party landscape.&quot; Hier welcomed the frankness of Modrow&#x27;s reply, adding that &quot;[t]he legacy of the Holocaust in a united Germany should be institutionalized. It should be on the conscience of every German from cradle to grave in a formalized way.&quot;

Later, in the early stages of the First Gulf War, the center released a report which accused Western companies of complicity in Iraq&#x27;s chemical weapons program. The report said that 207 companies, 86 of which were West German, had supplied Iraq with chemical weapons components as late as 1989. German companies had sold Zyklon-B to Iraq and they also helped it build gas chambers - modeled on those which were used by the Nazis - to exterminate Iranian prisoners of war, according to the report. Kenneth R. Timmerman, who prepared the report, wrote: &quot;The picture beginning to emerge is of a vast Iraqi pillage of the treasures of West German technology, aided and abetted by the West German authorities in their lust to increase the nation&#x27;s export earnings.&quot; Despite the allegations in the report, fully endorsed by Hier, the relationship between him and Kohl remained cordial.

=== World Social Forum ===
The center is very critical of the annual World Economic Forum-alternative the World Social Forum. In 2002, the center&#x27;s Shimon Samuels published in essay titled &quot;With a Clenched First and an Outstretched Arm: Antisemitism, Globalization, and the NGO Challenge in the International Area&quot; in the journal &quot;Jewish Political Studies Review&quot; run by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. In the essay, he claimed that the WSF was an amalgamation of &quot;anti-Globalism, anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, anti-Zionism, and antisemitism.&quot;

===Relationship with Barack Obama===
The center was a harsh critic of president Barack Obama&#x27;s Middle Eastern policy. In May 2011, Obama proposed that &quot;the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps&quot; which implied that Israel should withdraw from most of the territory it occupied in the Six-day war in 1967. The proposal drew ire from the center which claimed that such a withdrawal &quot;would be Auschwitz borders for Israel,&quot; alluding to the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp. In December 2016 it ranked the Obama administrations refusal to veto a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction as the most anti-semitic/anti-Israel incident that year. The center wrote &quot;The most stunning 2016 U.N. attack on Israel was facilitated by President Obama when the U.S. abstained on a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel for settlement construction.&quot;

===Relationship with Donald Trump===
In 2017, Hier faced harsh criticism from the Jewish-American community for accepting an invitation by the Trump campaign to hold a prayer at the president elect&#x27;s inauguration. Hier defended his decision by saying that he had offered his blessings to presidential candidates before. That didn&#x27;t placate his critics who claimed that Trump was a different kind of president who targeted minorities and had at times used tropes considered by many to be antisemitic. Criticism came from Peter Beinart writing in &quot;The Forward&quot; that &quot;they will reserve a special mention for the Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s Rabbi Marvin Hier. Last week, Trump rewarded him by asking him to offer an inaugural prayer.&quot; In an interview in The Times of Israel in 2019 Hier praised Trump for his decision to relocate the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and to recognize the Golan Heights as Israeli territory: &quot;Speaking as a Jew, so many presidents talked about making Jerusalem the capital of Israel. They made nice speeches, but in the end they couldn&#x27;t deliver. Trump delivered.&quot;

Hier and his wife have participated in fundraising events for Trump&#x27;s 2020 reelection campaign. The center has also at times criticized Trump. In January 2018 it asked the president to withdraw his statements about wanting more immigration from places from Norway, rather than from &quot;shithole countries&quot; like Haiti and those in Africa. Meir and the Kushner family who are Trump&#x27;s in-laws (related via Jared Kushner) have known each other for decades. The Kushner family has made several large donations to the center via the Charles and Seryl Kushner Family Foundation.

===Opposition to the BDS movement===

In 2013, the SWC released a report on the BDS movement which calls for boycotting Israel until it stops the occupation and discrimination against Palestinian citizens, and allows the Palestinian refugees to return. The report claimed that BDS is a &quot;thinly-disguised effort to coordinate and complement the violent strategy of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim &#x27;rejectionists&#x27; who have refused to make peace with Israel for over six decades, and to pursue a high-profile campaign composed of anti-Israel big lies to help destroy the Jewish State by any and all means&quot;. The report also said that BDS attacks Israel&#x27;s entire economy and society, holding all (Jewish) Israelis as collectively guilty.

===Conflict with the Committee for Charity and Support for the Palestinians===

On March 8, 2007, the head of international relations for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Stanley Trevor Samuels, was convicted (and later acquitted in an appeal) of defamation by a Paris courthouse for accusing the French-based Committee for Charity and Support for the Palestinians (CBSP) of sending funds to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers.

In its filing of the suit, the CBSP labelled the accusations &quot;ridiculous&quot;, stating that its charitable work consisted of providing aid to some 3,000 Palestinian orphans. The court ruled that documents produced by the Wiesenthal Center established no &quot;direct or indirect participation in financing terrorism&quot; on the part of the CBSP, and that the allegations were &quot;seriously defamatory&quot;. The Wiesenthal Center appealed the court ruling, and the appeal was granted in July 2009.

===2006 Iranian sumptuary law hoax===

In the spring of 2006, Douglas Kelly, the editor of the Canadian &quot;National Post&quot; found a column by Iranian in exile, Amir Taheri, alleging that the Iranian parliament might force minorities to wear identifiable clothing. Kelly phoned the center and spoke with Abraham Cooper and Hier who both confirmed the story as &quot;absolutely true.&quot; On May 18, 2006, one day before Kelly&#x27;s story was to be published, the center wrote a letter to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan urging the international community to pressure Iran to drop the measure. The letter characterized Taheri as &quot;a well known and well respected analyst on Iranian affairs&quot; and claimed that &quot;a consensus has developed regarding color badges to be worn by non-Moslems: yellow for Jews, red for Christians, blue for Zoroastrians and other colors for other religions.&quot; At that point, neither Cooper nor Hier had actually tried to verify the story.

The day after, Taylor Marsh called Aaron Breitbart, a researcher at the center to verify the story. He too said that the story was &quot;very true&quot; and &quot;very scary.&quot; He added that Hier had been on the phone for four hours to confirm the story, something Marsh found odd and she wondered how the confirmation could have taken four hours. The same day the story was published, several Iranian experts doubted its veracity and it was soon found out to have been a complete fabrication by Taheri. The newspaper that published the story retracted it and apologized for it, but the center never did apologize and refused to admit any mistake on their part.

===Hunt Museum controversy===

In January 2004, Shimon Samuels of the Paris branch of the center published an open letter to the president of Ireland, Mary McAleese, requesting the &quot;Irish Museum of the Year Award&quot; recently given to the Hunt Museum in Limerick to be retracted, until the conclusion of a demanded inquiry into the provenance of a significant number of items in the collection. In the letter he alleged that the founders of the museum, John and Gertrude Hunt, had close ties to the head of the Nazi Party (NSDP-AO) in Ireland, among others, and that the British had suspected the couple of espionage during the Second world war. The center also claimed, &#x27;The &quot;Hunt Museum Essential Guide&quot; describes only 150 of the over 2000 objects in the Museum&#x27;s collection and, notably, without providing information on their provenance – data that all museums are now required to provide in accordance with international procedure.&#x27;

This essentially accused the Hunt Museum in Limerick of keeping art and artifacts looted during the Second World War, which was described as &quot;unprofessional in the extreme&quot; by the expert Lynn Nicholas that cleared the museum of wrongdoing. The claim was taken so seriously that the examination was supervised by the prestigious Royal Irish Academy, whose 2006 report is available online. McAleese, who had been written to by the center, then criticized Samuels for &quot;a tissue of lies&quot;, adding that the center had diminished the name of Simon Wiesenthal. The center said that it had prepared its own 150-page report in May 2008 that would be published after vetting by its lawyers, but had not done so as of November 2008. The report was finally made on December 12, 2008.

===Opposition to Park51===
The Simon Wiesenthal Center opposed the construction of Park51, a Muslim community center in Manhattan in New York, because the planned location was only two blocks away from Ground Zero where the September 11 attacks had taken place. The executive director of the center&#x27;s Museum of Tolerance in Manhattan, Meyer May said it was &quot;insensitive&quot; to locate the centre there. &quot;The Jewish Week&quot; noted that the center itself was accused of intolerance when it built a museum in Jerusalem on land that was once a Muslim cemetery, after gaining approval from Israeli courts.

=== Accusations of antisemitism against Hugo Chávez ===
The Center criticized Hugo Chávez for various statements, including a statement in his Christmas speech in 2005:

The reference was to Simon Bolívar, a South American folk hero who led several countries to independence from Spain in the 19th century. But the center in its press release omitted the reference to Bolívar and quoted Chávez as follows: &quot;the world has wealth for all, but some minorities, the descendants of the same people that crucified Christ, have taken over all the wealth of the world.&quot; It asserted that he was referring to Jews, and denounced the remarks as antisemitic by way of his allusions to wealth. The American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and the Confederation of Jewish Associations of Venezuela defended Chávez, stating that he was speaking not of Jews, but of South America&#x27;s white oligarchy. The center&#x27;s representative in Latin America replied that Chávez&#x27;s mention of Christ-killers was &quot;ambiguous at best&quot; and that the &quot;decision to criticize Chávez had been taken after careful consideration&quot;.

=== Band attire controversies ===
The center has on two occasions criticized bands for wearing attire resembling Nazi uniforms or using Nazi symbolism. In 2011, Abraham Cooper, condemned the Japanese band Kishidan for wearing uniforms resembling those of the SS, the armed wing of the Nazi party. The band wore military-inspired uniforms, adorned with the German medal Iron Cross and Nazi insignia such as the death skull and SS eagle on MTV Japan&#x27;s primetime program &quot;Mega Vector&quot;. Cooper said in a written protest to the band&#x27;s management company Sony Music Artists, MTV Japan and the Japanese entertainment group Avex (Kishidan&#x27;s label at the time being and also the current one) that &quot;there is no excuse for such an outrage&quot; and that &quot;many young Japanese are &quot;woefully uneducated&quot; about the crimes against humanity committed by Nazi Germany and Japan during the second world war, but global entities like MTV and Sony Music should know better&quot;. As a result, Sony Music Artists and Avex issued a joint statement of public apology on their respective websites.

On November 11, 2018, Cooper denounced the South Korean band BTS with the following statement: &quot;Flags appearing on stage at their concert were eerily similar to the Nazi Swastika. It goes without saying that this group, which was invited to speak at the UN, owes the people of Japan and the victims of the Nazism an apology.&quot; The band&#x27;s management responded to the charge and offered their &quot;sincerest apologies&quot; but claimed that the similarities with Nazi symbols were unintentional.

=== Ben and Jerry&#x27;s ===
In December 2023, the Wiesenthal Center renewed objections to Anuradha Mittal, head of the board of directors at Ben &amp; Jerry’s via X, accusing Ben &amp; Jerry’s of “justifying” the October 7 massacre by Hamas. The tweet included a photo of Mittal, causing her to receive hate emails, tweets, and LinkedIn messages, leading to Mittal expressing her objection to the Wiesenthal Center’s tweet which made her feel unsafe.

== Praise and criticism ==
Simon Wiesenthal, the Holocaust survivor the center is named after, remained a strong supporter of Hier and his center. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1990 he said: &quot;The man is never quiet. He is always trying to do things no one else has ever tried. I know that he makes other Jewish organizations nervous. This center is young and aggressive. I hope this aggressivity will survive me.&quot; Wendy Brown in her 2009 dissertation criticized the use of tolerance for what she identified as a &quot;Zionist political agenda of the Wiesenthal Center&quot;, and the museum, for offering a one-sided view of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Lawrence Swaim in 2012 criticized the center for conflating criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism and for lying, comparing it to its eponym Simon Wiesenthal:

In &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;, Norman Finkelstein accuses the center of exaggerating and fabricating anti-Semitism for monetary gain:

==In popular culture==
The center is featured in the movie &quot;Freedom Writers.&quot; An exterior view of the center is given, and there are scenes inside the museum, showing simulation entrances to gas chambers in death camps.

<text>Elizabeth Ann Bates (July 26, 1947 – December 13, 2003) was a professor of cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego. She was an internationally renowned expert and leading researcher in child language acquisition, psycholinguistics, aphasia, and the neurological bases of language, and she authored 10 books and over 200 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on these subjects. Bates was well known for her assertion that linguistic knowledge is distributed throughout the brain and is subserved by general cognitive and neurological processes.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Bates earned a B.A. from St. Louis University in 1968, and an M.A. and PhD in human development from the University of Chicago in 1971 and 1974, respectively.

She was employed as a tenure-track professor at the University of Colorado from 1974-1981 before joining the faculty of the University of California, San Diego, where she worked until late 2003. Bates was one of the founders of the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD, the first department of its kind in the USA. She was also the director of the UCSD Center of Research in Language and the co-director of the San Diego State University/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program in Language and Communication Disorders. Bates also served as a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1976-1977 and at the National Research Council Institute of Psychology in Rome.

==Death and legacy==
On December 13, 2003, Elizabeth Bates died, after a year-long struggle with pancreatic cancer. Over the course of more than thirty years, Bates had established herself as a world leader in a number of fields – child development, language acquisition, aphasia research, cross-linguistic research, bilingualism, psycholinguistics and their neural underpinnings, and had trained, supported and collaborated with a diverse and international group of researchers and students. The Elizabeth Bates Graduate Research Fund was established at UCSD in her memory to assist graduate students&#x27; research.

==Research==
Elizabeth Bates was a pioneer and leading scholar in studying how the brain processes language. Bates made significant contributions in the fields of child language acquisition, cross-linguistic language processing, aphasia, and investigating the cognitive, neural, and social linguistic factors subserving these processes. With Brian MacWhinney, Bates developed a model of language processing called the competition model, which views language acquisition as an emergentist phenomenon that results from competition between lexical items, phonological forms, and syntactic patterns, accounting for language processing on the synchronic, ontogenetic, and phylogenetic time scales. She was a main proponent of the functionalist view of grammar, in that communication is the main force that drives language&#x27;s natural forms. This view provides support for Bates’ widely known perspective: the brain does not use specialized linguistic centers, but instead employs general cognitive abilities in order to solve a communicative conundrum. Much of her research provided evidence towards the core principles of empiricism and against the nativist school of thought, which made her a major player in the East Pole-West Pole divide of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

=== Language acquisition ===
In defense of communication functioning as a main force of language acquisition, she looked to the prelinguistic use of commands by infants that required them to develop and use social skills. She highlighted the reliance on pointing by infants in order to fill their need to communicate before they are able to speak. The child&#x27;s ability to incorporate imperatives in their gestures in order to make a command or request was found in her research and shows the necessity of communication regardless of language. Bates also coined the term , a word-like utterance made by prelinguistic children that has meaning (e.g. yumyum), but does not represent the adult-like form.

When discussing the time period where children begin to speak, Bates received a lot of attention for finding an overwhelming amount of nouns within the first 50 words of a native English speaker&#x27;s vocabulary. Bates helped settle an ongoing debate among linguists who argued that a referential language style, characterized by the child&#x27;s first 50 words containing mostly object labels, was a better strategy in developing language than a personal and socially expressive language style. She found that regardless of the strategy applied by the child, they learn words at the same rate. She did, however, find strong predictive power in the child&#x27;s vocabulary at 13 and 20 months old and their grammatical complexity at 2 years old. Bates finds that language learning comes from the neural plasticity in the brain; therefore, children can and are able to learn a language, even with brain trauma.

=== Domain-Specificity, Modularity and Neural Plasticity in Language Processing ===
Bates and colleagues also showed that after brain injury, adult aphasic patients&#x27; deficits were not specific to linguistic structures theorized to be localized to specific brain areas, or even restricted to the linguistic domain. Deficits and lesion sites instead overlap in the role that they affect speech fluency and complexity. Language is viewed as interrelated with cognitive processes such as memory, pattern recognition, and spreading activation. This perspective runs counter to the theory of Noam Chomsky, Eric Lenneberg, and Steven Pinker that language is processed in a domain-specific manner, by specific language modules in the mind, and can be localized to specific brain regions such as Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas.

Through her research, Bates demonstrated that neural plasticity allows children with damage to the right hemisphere or the left hemisphere to learn and use language within normal range After matching for age, sex and socioeconomic status, any differences from children who did not suffer brain damage were minor. In contrast, the same study presented striking evidence that similar brain damage has much more severe and often permanent consequences on language use when incurred as an adult. In a comparative study on the Origins of Language Disorders, Bates found that the period between 0 and 5 years of age was important to the argument of neural plasticity as this suggests that reorganization in response to an injury occurs during this period. However, there are limits to brain plasticity. Despite the area that is damaged, whether it be right-frontal or left-frontal, there was an increased risk for expressive language delay within 19 months to 30 months. This suggests that left-frontal regions may be important for language production in the adult brain, but aren’t likely to be a unique or innately set up to subserve language functions.

<text>Lloyd Cassel Douglas (August 27, 1877 – February 13, 1951) was an American minister and author.

Douglas was one of the most popular American authors of his time, although he did not write his first novel until he was 50.

== Biography ==
He was born in Columbia City, Indiana. His father was a minister and the family lived for part of Douglas&#x27;s boyhood in Monroeville and Wilmot, Indiana; and Florence, Kentucky. In the latter town, his father, Alexander Jackson Douglas, was pastor of the Hopeful Lutheran Church.

After receiving the A.M. degree from Wittenberg College (now Wittenberg University) in Springfield, Ohio, in 1903, Douglas was ordained in the Lutheran ministry. He served in pastorates in North Manchester, Indiana; Lancaster, Ohio; and Washington, D.C. 

After being ordained, Douglas married Bessie I. Porch. They had two daughters together: Bessie J. Douglas, born about 1899, and Virginia V. Douglas, born about 1901. 

From 1911 to 1915, Douglas was director of religious work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The next six years, he was minister of The First Congregational Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a university town. 

In 1920 he moved to Akron, Ohio, to serve as the Sr. Minister of the First Congregational Church of Akron until 1926. That year he moved to Los Angeles, California, for a pastorate. 

Lastly he served as pastor at St. James United Church in Montreal, Quebec. Douglas retired from the pastorate to write full time. His biographer, Louis Sheaffer, comments, &quot;he never stated publicly why he changed denominations.&quot;

Douglas&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot;, published in 1929, was an immediate success. Critics held that his type of fiction was in the tradition of the great religious writings of an earlier generation, such as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. 

Douglas followed this with his novels &quot;Forgive Us Our Trespasses&quot;; &quot;Precious Jeopardy&quot;; &quot;Green Light&quot;; &quot;White Banners&quot;; &quot;Disputed Passage&quot;; &quot; Invitation To Live&quot;; &quot;Doctor Hudson&#x27;s Secret Journal&quot;; &quot;The Robe&quot;; and &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; was adapted twice for the screen, first in 1935 in a film starring Robert Taylor and Irene Dunne, and in 1954, with Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman.

In 1937, &quot;Green Light&quot; was made into a film starring Errol Flynn. &quot;White Banners&quot;, starring Claude Raines and Fay Bainter, came to the screen in 1938. The film of &quot;Disputed Passage&quot; was released in 1939. &quot;Dr. Hudson&#x27;s Secret Journal&quot;, a prequel to &quot;The Magnificent Obsession&quot;, aired on syndicated television in 1955–1957. John Howard starred as Dr. Wayne Hudson in 78 episodes.

&quot;The Robe&quot; sold more than 2 million copies, without any reprint edition. Douglas sold the motion picture rights to &quot;The Robe&quot;, though the film, starring Richard Burton, was not released until 1953, after Douglas&#x27;s death.

Having had an unhappy experience with filming adaptations of his works, when he wrote &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; as the sequel to &quot;The Robe&quot;, Douglas made certain stipulations related to his publication. He said that this would be his last novel and that he would not permit it to be adapted as a motion picture, used in any radio broadcast, condensed, or serialised. Eventually, however, movie interests found a way around these and &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; was filmed in 1959. It starred Howard Keel in one of his few non-singing screen roles as Peter.

Douglas&#x27;s last book was the autobiographical &quot;Time To Remember&quot;, which described his life up to his childhood and education for the ministry. He died before he was able to write the intended second volume. His daughters, Virginia Douglas Dawson and Betty Douglas Wilson, completed this volume, published posthumously as &quot;The Shape of Sunday&quot; by his daughters.

Douglas died in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Hoogkarspel (West Frisian: &quot;Hougkarspel&quot;) is a village in the municipality Drechterland, located in the north west of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland and the region of West-Frisia. The name derives from the words &quot;hoog&quot; (Dutch for &quot;high&quot;) and &quot;kerspel&quot;, a Middle Dutch word for parish.

Hoogkarspel was a separate municipality until 1979, when it was merged into the new municipality of Bangert, which has been renamed to Drechterland in 1980.

==Transportation==
There is a railway station, Hoogkarspel, with half-hourly connections to Hoorn, Amsterdam and Enkhuizen.

== Archeology ==
The so-called Hoogkarspel culture is an important part of the Elp culture, a culture of the Bronze Age dating from approx. 1800-800 BC. In the 1960s remains were found of a tumulus behind the Hoogkarspel water tower, and remains of an agricultural settlement were discovered in the 1970s, dating from 1000 BC. Two periods are identified, Hoogkarspel-I (1400-1100 cal BC) and Hoogkarspel-II (800-400 cal BC). Earthenware found in the area is divided into old and young, following the influential publication by R. W. Brandt in 1988. 

South-west of the former &quot;Medemblikker Tolhuis&quot; (Medemblik tollbooth) remains of a mound from the late Bronze Age were found. The Medemblik tollbooth was a tollbooth next to a well maintained road to the city Medemblik, and this road still exists.

<doc id="424518" wikidata="Q1274361" url="?curid=424518" title="Roman candle (firework)">
<text>A Roman candle is a traditional type of firework that ejects one or more stars or exploding shells. Roman candles come in a variety of sizes, from diameter for consumers, up to diameter in professional fireworks displays.

Roman candles are banned in some countries as they have a tendency to malfunction. They are banned in Finland and the Netherlands, and illegal to possess or set off in the U.S. states of California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Rhode Island.

== Construction and ignition ==

Roman candles are fireworks constructed with bentonite, lifting charge, pyrotechnic star, black powder, and delay charge. The device is ignited from the top, which should be pointed into the sky, away from people. The delay powder is packed tightly in the tube, so that the flame cannot reach around the sides of the plug of delay composition. It therefore burns slowly; as it is consumed, the flame moves down through the tube. When the flame reaches the topmost pyrotechnic star, the star is ignited. Because the star fits loosely in the tube, the fire spreads around it and ignites the lift charge. The lift charge burns quickly, propelling the star out of the tube. In doing so it also ignites the layer of delay powder beneath it, and the process repeats. 
There are several variations on this:
* Many Chinese Roman candles use clay instead of delay powder and run a length of fuse down the inside of the candle to time the lifts.
* Larger Roman candles (three-inch diameter or more) usually add more lift to the highest layers and less to the lower layers in order to cause the stars to lift to the same altitude. This is due to the shorter length of tube available for accelerating the higher stars (see firearms internal ballistics).
* Some very large Roman candles load comet shells instead of stars.

==Star colors and chemistry==
The stars of Roman candles can be found in a variety of colors. Colors are manipulated by adding compounds which, when ignited, release visible light and other radiation. For example, when potassium perchlorate (KClO4) is used as an oxidizer, chemical reactions involving the dissociated elements of the perchlorate—potassium and chlorine ions—create barium compounds which emit green light (especially BaCl2). The potassium compounds formed by this reaction emit mostly near-infrared light, and so they do not affect the color of the star in a significant way. This reaction occurs at temperatures exceeding 2500 °C (4500 °F), at which the ions in KCl dissociate into free K+ and Cl−. Alternatively, SrCO3 can be added to the candle to produce a red or pink star, but, because it does not oxidize, more oxidizers and fuels must be added to sustain combustion. During combustion, various strontium compounds (especially Sr(OH)2) emit red light, most of which is between 506 and 722 nm in wavelength.

<doc id="424526" wikidata="Q557709" url="?curid=424526" title="Bullion">
<text>Bullion is non-ferrous metal that has been refined to a high standard of elemental purity. The term is ordinarily applied to bulk metal used in the production of coins and especially to precious metals such as gold and silver. It comes from the Anglo-Norman term for a melting-house where metal was refined, and earlier from French , &quot;boiling&quot;. Although precious metal bullion is no longer used to make coins for general circulation, it continues to be held as an investment with a reputation for stability in periods of economic uncertainty. To assess the purity of gold bullion, the centuries-old technique of fire assay is still employed, together with modern spectroscopic instrumentation, to accurately determine its quality.

== As investment ==
The specifications of bullion are often regulated by market bodies or legislation. In the European Union, the minimum purity for gold to be referred to as &quot;bullion&quot;, which is treated as investment gold with regard to taxation, is 99.5% for gold bullion bars and 90% for bullion coins. Investors may choose to purchase physical bullion for several reasons to attempt to hedge against currency risks, inflation risks, geopolitical risks, or to add diversification to an investment portfolio.

== London bullion market ==
The London bullion market is an over-the-counter market for wholesale trading of gold and silver. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) coordinates activities of its members and other participants in the London bullion market. The LBMA sets and promotes quality standards for gold and silver bullion bars. The minimum acceptable fineness of the Good Delivery Bars is 99.5% for gold bars and 99.9% for silver bars. Bars with a purity less than these may not be referred to as &quot;bullion&quot;.

== Coins ==
Bullion coins are contemporary precious metal coins minted by official agencies for investment purposes. Some bullion coins have been used as currency throughout the 20th century, such as the Maria Theresa thaler and the Krugerrand. Modern bullion coins generally do not enter common circulation despite having legal tender status and nominal face value. Some modern bullion coins are produced as business strike and collectible proof and uncirculated versions, such as the American Silver Eagle and American Gold Eagle coins. Private mint strikes called bullion rounds, bullion wafers or bullion bars are typically sold at prices slightly above the underlying prevailing precious metals spot price commensurate with their precious metal content, whereas collectible versions are sold at a significant premium over their precious metal bullion melt value. In some cases, the grade and mintages of privately struck rounds, bars or wafers can affect their value as a collectible too, they can at times be considered collectible numismatic pieces rather than bullion items.

== Uses ==

Professional market participants participate in the bullion markets, such as banks, fabricators, refiners, and vault operators or transport companies, as well as brokers. They provide facilities for the refining, melting, assaying, transporting, trading and vaulting of gold and silver bullion. Other professional parties such as investment companies and jewelers use bullion in the context of products or services which they produce or offer to customers. Shares of the world&#x27;s largest gold exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Shares, represent a gold spot price mimicking derivative although shareholders in popular gold ETFs such as GLD are almost always unsecured creditors, meaning they own no vaulted gold bullion potentially underlying the exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Investors often prefer to own bullion outright over ETFs due to the minimization of counter-party risks inherent. Private individuals use bullion as an investment or as a store of value. Gold bullion and silver bullion are the most important forms of physical precious metals investments. Bullion investments can be considered as insurance against inflation or economic turmoil, their sole direct counterparty risk is theft or government confiscation. Compared to numismatic coins, bullion bars or bullion coins can typically be purchased and traded at lower price premiums over the fluctuating spot price and their trading bid/ask spreads or buy/sell price differences are closer to the values of the contained precious metals.

<doc id="424531" wikidata="Q146715" url="?curid=424531" title="Illyrians">
<text>The Illyrians (, ; ) were a group of Indo-European-speaking people who inhabited the western Balkan Peninsula in ancient times. They constituted one of the three main Paleo-Balkan populations, along with the Thracians and Greeks.

The territory the Illyrians inhabited came to be known as Illyria to later Greek and Roman authors, who identified a territory that corresponds to most of Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, much of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, western and central Serbia and some parts of Slovenia between the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Drava river in the north, the Morava river in the east and the Ceraunian Mountains in the south. The first account of Illyrian people dates back to the 6th century BC, in the works of the ancient Greek writer Hecataeus of Miletus.

The name &quot;Illyrians&quot;, as applied by the ancient Greeks to their northern neighbors, may have referred to a broad, ill-defined group of people. It has been suggested that the Illyrian tribes never collectively identified as &quot;Illyrians&quot;, and that it is unlikely that they used any collective nomenclature at all. &quot;Illyrians&quot; seems to be the name of a specific Illyrian tribe who were among the first to encounter the ancient Greeks during the Bronze Age. The Greeks later applied this term &quot;Illyrians&quot;, &quot;pars pro toto&quot;, to all people with similar language and customs.

In archaeological, historical and linguistic studies, research about the Illyrians, from the late 19th to the 21st century, has moved from Pan-Illyrian theories, which identified as Illyrian even groups north of the Balkans to more well-defined groupings based on Illyrian onomastics and material anthropology since the 1960s as newer inscriptions were found and sites excavated. There are two principal Illyrian onomastic areas: the southern and the Dalmatian-Pannonian, with the area of the Dardani as a region of overlapping between the two. A third area, to the north of them – which in ancient literature was usually identified as part of Illyria – has been connected more to the Venetic language than to Illyrian. Illyric settlement in Italy was and still is attributed to a few ancient tribes which are thought to have migrated along the Adriatic shorelines to the Italian peninsula from the geographic &quot;Illyria&quot;: the Dauni, the Peuceti and Messapi (collectively known as Iapyges, and speaking the Messapic language).

The term &quot;Illyrians&quot; last appears in the historical record in the 7th century, referring to a Byzantine garrison operating within the former Roman province of Illyricum. What happened to the Illyrians after the settlement of the Slavs in the region is a matter of debate among scholars, and includes the hypothesis of the origin of the Albanian language from an Illyrian language, which is often supported by scholars for obvious geographic and historical reasons but not proven. 

==Etymology==
While the Illyrians are largely recorded under the ethnonyms of Illyrioi () and Illyrii, these appear to be misspelt renditions by Greek or Latin-speaking writers. Based on historically attested forms denoting specific Illyrian tribes or the Illyrians as a whole (e.g., () and &quot;Hil(l)uri&quot;),
the native tribal name from which these renditions were based has been reconstructed by linguists such as Heiner Eichner as *&quot;Hillurio-&quot; (&lt; older *&quot;Hullurio-&quot;). According to Eichner, this ethnonym, translating to &#x27;water snake&#x27;, is derived from Proto-Indo-European (&#x27;of water, aquatic&#x27;) sharing a common root with Ancient Greek () meaning &#x27;fish&#x27; or a &#x27;small water snake&#x27;. The Illyrian ethnonym shows a &quot;dl&quot; &gt; &quot;ll&quot; shift via assimilation as well as the addition of the suffix -&quot;uri(o)&quot; which is found in Illyrian toponyms such as Tragurium.

Eichner also points out the tribal name&#x27;s close semantic correspondence to that of the Enchelei which translates to &#x27;eel-people&#x27;, depicting a similar motif of aquatic snake-like fauna. It is also pointed out that the Ancient Greeks must have learned this name from a tribe in southern Illyria, later applying it to all related and neighbouring peoples.

==Terminology and attestation==
The terms &quot;Illyrians&quot;, &quot;Illyria&quot; and &quot;Illyricum&quot; have been used throughout history for ethnic and geographic contextualizations that have changed over time. Re-contextualizations of these terms often confused ancient writers and modern scholars. Notable scholarly efforts have been dedicated to trying to analyze and explain these changes.

The first known mention of Illyrians occurred in the late 6th and the early 5th century BC in fragments of Hecataeus of Miletus, the author of &quot;Genealogies&quot; () and of &quot;Description of the Earth&quot; or &quot;Periegesis&quot; ( or ), where the Illyrians are described as a barbarian people. In the Macedonian history during the 6th and 5th century BC, the term &quot;Illyrian&quot; had a political meaning that was quite definite, denoting a kingdom established on the north-western borders of Upper Macedonia. From the 5th century BC onwards, the term &quot;Illyrian&quot; was already applied to a large ethnic group whose territory extended deep into the Balkan mainland. Ancient Greeks clearly considered the Illyrians as a completely distinct &quot;ethnos&quot; from both the neighboring Thracians and the Macedonians.

Most scholars hold that the territory originally designated as &#x27;Illyrian&#x27; was roughly located in the region of the south-eastern Adriatic (modern Albania and Montenegro) and its hinterland, then was later extended to the whole Roman Illyricum province, which stretched from the eastern Adriatic to the Danube. After the Illyrians had come to be widely known to the Greeks due to their proximity, this ethnic designation was broadened to include other peoples who, for some reason, were considered by ancient writers to be related with those peoples originally designated as Illyrians (, ).

The original designation may have occurred either during the Middle/Late Bronze Age or at the beginning of the 8th century BC. According to the former hypothesis, the name was taken by traders from southern Greece from a small group of people on the coast, the /&quot;Illyrii&quot; (first mentioned by Pseudo-Skylax and later described by Pliny the Elder), and thereafter applied to all of the people of the region; this has been explained by the substantial evidence of Minoan and Mycenaean contact in the valley where the Illyrioi/Illyrii presumably lived. According to the latter hypothesis the label Illyrians was first used by outsiders, in particular Ancient Greeks; this has been argued on the basis that when the Greeks began to frequent the eastern Adriatic coast with the colonization of Corcyra, they started to have some knowledge and perceptions of the indigenous peoples of western Balkans.

It has been suggested that the Illyrian tribes evidently never collectively identified themselves as Illyrians and that it is unlikely that they used any collective nomenclature at all. Most modern scholars are certain that all the peoples of western Balkans that were collectively labeled as &#x27;Illyrians&#x27; were not a culturally or linguistically homogeneous entity. For instance, some tribes like the Bryges would not have been identified as Illyrian. What criteria were initially used to define this group of peoples or how and why the term &#x27;Illyrians&#x27; began to be used to describe the indigenous population of western Balkans cannot be said with certainty. Scholarly debates have been waged to find an answer to the question whether the term &#x27;Illyrians&#x27; () derived from some eponymous tribe, or whether it has been applied to designate the indigenous population as a general term for some other specific reason.

===&quot;Illyrii proprie dicti&quot;===

Ancient Roman writers Pliny the Elder and Pomponius Mela used the term (&#x27;properly called Illyrians&#x27;) to designate a people that was located in the coast of modern Albania and Montenegro. Many modern scholars view the &#x27;properly called Illyrians&#x27; as a trace of the Illyrian kingdom known in the sources from the 4th century BC until 167 BC, which was ruled in Roman times by the Ardiaei and Labeatae when it was centered in the Bay of Kotor and Lake Skadar. According to other modern scholars, the term may have originally referred only to a small &quot;ethnos&quot; in the area between Epidaurum and Lissus, and Pliny and Mela may have followed a literary tradition that dates back as early as Hecataeus of Miletus. Placed in central Albania, the also might have been Rome&#x27;s first contact with Illyrian peoples. In that case, it did not indicate an original area from which the Illyrians expanded. The area of the &quot;Illyrii proprie dicti&quot; is largely included in the southern Illyrian onomastic province in modern linguistics.

==Origins==

===Archaeology===
The Illyrians emerged from the fusion of PIE-descended Yamnaya-related population movements ca. 2500 BCE in the Balkans with the pre-existing Balkan Neolithic population, initially forming &quot;Proto-Illyrian&quot; Bronze Age cultures in the Balkans. The proto-Illyrians during the course of their settlement towards the Adriatic coast merged with such populations of a pre-Illyrian substratum – like Enchelei might have been – leading to the formation of the historical Illyrians who were attested in later times. It has been suggested that the myth of Cadmus and Harmonia may be a reflection in mythology of the end of the pre-Illyrian era in the southern Adriatic region as well as in those regions located north of Macedonia and Epirus.

Older Pan-Illyrian theories which emerged in the 1920s placed the proto-Illyrians as the original inhabitants of a very large area which reached central Europe. These theories, which have been dismissed, were used in the politics of the era and its racialist notions of Nordicism and Aryanism. The main fact which these theories tried to address was the existence of traces of Illyrian toponymy in parts of Europe beyond the western Balkans, an issue whose origins are still unclear. The specific theories have found little archaeological corroboration, as no convincing evidence for significant migratory movements from the Urnfield-Lusatian culture into the west Balkans has ever been found.

===Archaeogenetics===
Mathieson et al. 2018 archaeogenetic study included three samples from Dalmatia: two Early &amp; Middle Bronze Age (1631-1521/1618-1513 calBCE) samples from Veliki Vanik (near Vrgorac) and one Iron Age (805-761 calBCE) sample from Jazinka Cave in Krka National Park. According to ADMIXTURE analysis they had approximately 60% Early European Farmers, 33% Western Steppe Herders and 7% Western Hunter-Gatherer-related ancestry. The male individual from Veliki Vanik carried the Y-DNA haplogroup J2b2a1-L283 while his and two female individuals mtDNA haplogroup were I1a1, W3a1 and HV0e. Freilich et al. 2021 identify the Veliki Vanik samples as related to the Cetina culture (EBA-MBA western Balkans).

Patterson et al. 2022 study examined 18 samples from the Middle Bronze Age up to Early Iron Age Croatia, which was part of Illyria. Out of the nine Y-DNA samples retrieved, which coincide with the historical territory where Illyrians lived (including tested Iapodian and Liburnian sites), almost all belonged to the patrilineal line J2b2a1-L283 (&gt;J-PH1602 &gt; J-Y86930 and &gt;J-Z1297 subclades) with the exception of one R1b-L2. The mtDNA haplogroups fell under various subclades of H, H1, H3b, H5, J1c2, J1c3, T2a1a, T2b, T2b23, U5a1g, U8b1b1, HV0e. In a three-way admixture model, they approximately had 49-59% EEF, 35-46% Steppe and 2-10% WHG-related ancestry. In Lazaridis et al. (2022) key parts of the territory of historical territory of Illyria were tested. In 18 samples from the Cetina culture, all males except for one (R-L51 &gt; Z2118) carried Y-DNA haplogroup J-L283. Many of them could be further identified as J-L283 &gt; Z597 (&gt; J-Y15058 &gt; J-Z38240 &gt; J-PH1602). The majority of individuals carried mtDNA haplogroups J1c1 and H6a1a. The related Posušje culture yielded the same Y-DNA haplogroup (J-L283 &gt; J-Z38240). The same J-L283 population appears in the MBA-IA Velim Kosa tumuli of Liburni in Croatia (J-PH1602), and similar in LBA-IA Velika Gruda tumuli in Montenegro (J-Z2507 &gt; J-Z1297 &gt; J-Y21878). The oldest J-L283 (&gt; J-Z597) sample in the study was found in MBA Shkrel, northern Albania as early as the 19th century BCE. In northern Albania, IA Çinamak, half of them men carried J-L283 (&gt; J-Z622, J-Y21878) and the other half R-M269 (R-CTS1450, R-PF7563). The oldest sample in Çinamak dates to the first era of post-Yamnaya movements (EBA) and carries R-M269. Autosomally, Croatian Bronze Age samples from various sites, from Cetina valley and Bezdanjača Cave were &quot;extremely similar in their ancestral makeup&quot;, while from Montenegro&#x27;s Velika Gruda mainly had an admixture of &quot;Anatolian Neolithic (~50%), Eastern European hunter-gatherer (~12%), and Balkan hunter-gatherer ancestry (~18%)&quot;. The oldest Balkan J-L283 samples have been found in final Early Bronze Age (ca. 1950 BCE) site of Mokrin in Serbia and about 100–150 years later in Shkrel, northern Albania.

Aneli et al. 2022 based on samples from EIA Dalmatia argue that the Early Iron Age Illyrians made &quot;part of the same Mediterranean continuum&quot; with the &quot;autochthonous [...] Roman Republicans&quot; and had high affinity with Daunians, part of Iapygians in Apulia, southeastern Italy. Iron Age male samples from Daunian sites have yielded J-M241&gt;J-L283+, R-M269&gt;Z2103+ and I-M223 lineages. Three Bronze Age males which carry J-L283 have been found in the Late Bronze Age Nuragic civilization of Sardinia. This late find in Sardinia in comparison to western Balkan samples suggests a dispersal from the western Balkans towards this region, perhaps via an intermediary group in the Italian peninsula.

==In ancient Greek and Roman literature==
Different versions of the genealogy of the Illyrians, their tribes and their eponymous ancestor, Illyrius, existed in the ancient world both in fictional and non-fictional Greco-Roman literature. The fact that there were many versions of the genealogical story of Illyrius was ascertained by Ancient Greek historian Appian (1st–2nd century AD). However, only two versions of all these genealogical stories are attested. The first version—which reports the legend of Cadmus and Harmonia—was recorded by Euripides and Strabo in accounts that would be presented in detail in &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus (1st to 2nd century AD). The second version—which reports the legend of Polyphemus and Galatea—was recorded by Appian (1st–2nd century AD) in his &quot;Illyrike&quot;.

According to the first version Illyrius was the son of Cadmus and Harmonia, whom the Enchelei had chosen to be their leaders. He eventually ruled Illyria and became the eponymous ancestor of the whole Illyrian people. In one of these versions, Illyrius was named so after Cadmus left him by a river named the &quot;Illyrian&quot;, where a serpent found and raised him.

Appian writes that many mythological stories were still circulating in his time, and he chose a particular version because it seemed to be the most correct one. Appian&#x27;s genealogy of tribes is not complete as he writes that other Illyrian tribes exist, which he has not included. According to Appian&#x27;s tradition, Polyphemus and Galatea gave birth to Celtus, Galas, and Illyrius, three brothers, progenitors respectively of Celts, Galatians and Illyrians. Illyrius had multiple sons: Encheleus, Autarieus, Dardanus, Maedus, Taulas and Perrhaebus, and daughters: Partho, Daortho, Dassaro and others. From these, sprang the Taulantii, Parthini, Dardani, Encheleae, Autariates, Dassaretii and the Daorsi. Autareius had a son Pannonius or Paeon and these had sons Scordiscus and Triballus. Appian&#x27;s genealogy was evidently composed in Roman times encompassing barbarian peoples other than Illyrians like Celts and Galatians. and choosing a specific story for his audience that included most of the peoples who dwelled in the Illyricum of the Antonine era. However, the inclusion in his genealogy of the Enchelei and the Autariatae, whose political strength has been highly weakened, reflects a pre-Roman historical situation.

Basically, ancient Greeks included in their mythological accounts all the peoples with whom they had close contacts. In Roman times, ancient Romans created more mythical or genealogical relations to include various new peoples, regardless of their large ethnic and cultural differences. Appian&#x27;s genealogy lists the earliest known peoples of Illyria in the group of the first generation, consisting mostly of southern Illyrian peoples firstly encountered by the Greeks, some of which were the Enchelei, the Taulantii, the Dassaretii and the Parthini. Some peoples that came to the Balkans at a later date such as the Scordisci are listed in the group that belongs to the third generation. The Scordisci were a Celtic people mixed with the indigenous Illyrian and Thracian population. The Pannonians have not been known to the Greeks, and it seems that before the 2nd century BC they did not come into contact with the Romans. Almost all the Greek writers referred to the Pannonians with the name Paeones until late Roman times. The Scordisci and Pannonians were considered Illyrian mainly because they belonged to Illyricum since the early Roman Imperial period.

==History==
===Iron Age===

Depending on the complexity of the diverse physical geography of the Balkans, arable farming and livestock (mixed farming) rearing had constituted the economic basis of the Illyrians during the Iron Age.

In southern Illyria organized realms were formed earlier than in other areas of this region. One of the oldest known Illyrian kingdoms is that of the Enchelei, which seems to have reached its height from the 8th–7th centuries BC, but the kingdom fell from dominant power around the 6th century BC. It seems that the weakening of the kingdom of Enchelae resulted in their assimilation and inclusion into a newly established Illyrian realm at the latest in the 5th century BC, marking the arising of the Dassaretii, who appear to have replaced the Enchelei in the lakeland area of Lychnidus. According to a number of modern scholars the dynasty of Bardylis—the first attested Illyrian dynasty—was Dassaretan.

The weakening of the Enchelean realm was also caused by the strengthening of another Illyrian kingdom established in its vicinity—that of the Taulantii—which existed for some time along with that of the Enchelei. The Taulantii—another people among the more anciently known groups of Illyrian tribes—lived on the Adriatic coast of southern Illyria (modern Albania), dominating at various times much of the plain between the Drin and the Aous, comprising the area around Epidamnus/Dyrrhachium. In the 7th century BC the Taulantii invoked the aid of Corcyra and Corinth in a war against the Liburni. After the defeat and expulsion from the region of the Liburni, the Corcyreans founded in 627 BC on the Illyrian mainland a colony called &quot;Epidamnus&quot;, thought to have been the name of a barbarian king of the region. A flourishing commercial centre emerged and the city grew rapidly. The Taulantii continued to play an important role in Illyrian history between the 5th and 4th–3rd centuries BC, and in particular, in the history of Epidamnus, both as its neighbors and as part of its population. Notably they influenced the affairs in the internal conflicts between aristocrats and democrats. The Taulantian kingdom seems to have reached its climax during Glaukias&#x27; rule, in the years between 335 BC and 302 BC.

The Illyrian kingdoms frequently came into conflicts with the neighbouring Ancient Macedonians, and the Illyrian pirates were also seen as significant threat to the neighbouring peoples.

At the Neretva Delta, there was a strong Hellenistic influence on the Illyrian tribe of Daors. Their capital was Daorson located in &quot;Ošanići&quot; near Stolac in Herzegovina, which became the main center of classical Illyrian culture. Daorson, during the 4th century BC, was surrounded by megalithic, 5 meter high stonewalls, composed out of large trapeze stones blocks. Daors also made unique bronze coins and sculptures. The Illyrians even conquered Greek colonies on the Dalmatian islands.
After Philip II of Macedon defeated Bardylis (358 BC), the Grabaei under Grabos II became the strongest state in Illyria. Philip II killed 7,000 Illyrians in a great victory and annexed the territory up to Lake Ohrid. Next, Philip II reduced the Grabaei, and then went for the Ardiaei, defeated the Triballi (339 BC), and fought with Pleurias (337 BC).

During the second part of the 3rd century BC, a number of Illyrian tribes seem to have united to form a proto-state stretching from the central part of present-day Albania up to Neretva river in Herzegovina. The political entity was financed on piracy and ruled from 250 BC by the king Agron. The Illyrian attack under Agron, against Aerolians mounted in either 232 or 231 BC, is described by Polybius:
He was succeeded by his wife Teuta, who assumed the regency for her stepson Pinnes following Agron&#x27;s death in 231 BC.

In his work &quot;The Histories&quot;, Polybius (2nd century BC) reported first diplomatic contacts between the Romans and Illyrians. In the Illyrian Wars of 229 BC, 219 BC and 168 BC, Rome overran the Illyrian settlements and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe for Roman commerce. There were three campaigns: the first against Teuta, the second against Demetrius of Pharos and the third against Gentius. The initial campaign in 229 BC marks the first time that the Roman Navy crossed the Adriatic Sea to launch an invasion.
The impetus behind the emergence of larger regional groups, such as &quot;Iapodes&quot;, &quot;Liburnians&quot;, &quot;Pannonians&quot; etc., is traced to increased contacts with the Mediterranean and La Tène &#x27;global worlds&#x27;. This catalyzed &quot;the development of more complex political institutions and the increase in differences between individual communities&quot;. Emerging local elites selectively adopted either La Tène or Hellenistic and, later, Roman cultural templates &quot;in order to legitimize and strengthen domination within their communities. They were competing fiercely through either alliance or conflict and resistance to Roman expansion. Thus, they established more complex political alliances, which convinced (Greco-Roman) sources to see them as &#x27;ethnic&#x27; identities.&quot;

The Roman Republic subdued the Illyrians during the 2nd century BC. An Illyrian revolt was crushed under Augustus, resulting in the division of Illyria in the provinces of Pannonia in the north and Dalmatia in the south. Depictions of the Illyrians, usually described as &quot;barbarians&quot; or &quot;savages&quot;, are universally negative in Greek and Roman sources.

===Roman era and Late Antiquity===
Prior to the Roman conquest of Illyria, the Roman Republic had started expanding its power and territory across the Adriatic Sea. The Romans came nevertheless into a series of conflicts with the Illyrians, equally known as the Illyrian Wars, beginning in 229 BC until 168 BC as the Romans defeated Gentius at Scodra. The Great Illyrian Uprising took place in the Roman province of Illyricum in the 1st century AD, in which an alliance of native peoples revolted against the Romans. The main ancient source that describes this military conflict is Velleius Paterculus, which was incorporated into the second book of &quot;Roman History&quot;. Another ancient source about it is the biography of Octavius Augustus by Pliny the Elder. The two leaders of uprising were Bato the Breucian and Bato the Daesitiate.

Geographically, the name &#x27;Illyria&#x27; came to mean Roman &quot;Illyricum&quot; which from the 4th century to the 7th century signified the prefecture of Illyricum. It covered much of the western and central Balkans. After the defeat of the Great Illyrian Revolt and the consolidation of Roman power in the Balkans, the process of integration of Illyrians in the Roman world accelerated even further. Some Illyrian communities were organized in their pre-Roman locations under their own &quot;civitates&quot;. Others migrated or were forcefully resettled in different regions. Some groups like the Azali were transferred from their homeland to frontier areas (northern Hungary) after the Great Illyrian Revolt. In Dacia, Illyrian communities like the Pirustae who were skilled miners were settled to the gold mines of Alburnus Maior where they formed their own communities. In Trajan&#x27;s period these population movements were likely part of a deliberate policy of resettling, while later they involved free migrations. In their new regions, they were free salaried workers. Inscriptions show that by that era many of Illyrians had acquired Roman citizenship.

By the end of the 2nd century and beginning of the 3rd century CE, Illyrian populations had been highly integrated in the Roman Empire and formed a core population of its Balkan provinces. During the crisis of the Third Century and the establishment of the Dominate, a new elite faction of Illyrians who were part of the Roman army along the Pannonian and Danubian Limes rose in Roman politics. This faction produced many emperors from the late 3rd to the 6th century CE who are collectively known as the Illyrian Emperors and include the Constantinian, Valentinianic and Justinianic dynasties. Gaius Messius Quintus Traianus Decius, a native of Sirmium, is usually recognized as the first Illyrian emperor in historiography. The rise of the Illyrian Emperors represents the rise of the role of the army in imperial politics and the increasing shift of the center of imperial politics from the city of Rome itself to the eastern provinces of the empire.

The term &quot;Illyrians&quot; last appears in the historical record in the 7th century AD, in the &quot;Miracula Sancti Demetrii&quot;, referring to a Byzantine garrison operating within the former Roman province of Illyricum. However, in the acts of the Second Council of Nicaea from 787, Nikephoros of Durrës signed himself as &quot;Episcopus of Durrës, province of the Illyrians&quot;. Since the Middle Ages the term &quot;Illyrian&quot; has been used principally in connection with the Albanians, although it was also used to describe the western wing of the Southern Slavs up to the 19th century, being revived in particular during the Habsburg monarchy. In Byzantine literature, references to Illyria as a defined region in administrative terms end after 1204 and the term specifically began to refer only to the more confined Albanian territory.

==Society==
===Social and political organisation===
The structure of Illyrian society during classical antiquity was characterised by a conglomeration of numerous tribes and small realms ruled by warrior elites, a situation similar to that in most other societies at that time. Thucidides in the History of the Peloponnesian War (5th century BC) addresses the social organisation of the Illyrian tribes via a speech he attributes to Brasidas, in which he recounts that the mode of rulership among the Illyrian tribes is that of &quot;dynasteia&quot;—which Thucidides used in reference to foreign customs—neither democratic, nor oligarchic. Brasidas then goes on to explain that in the &quot;dynasteia&quot; the ruler rose to power &quot;by no other means than by superiority in fighting&quot;. Pseudo-Scymnus (2nd century BC) in reference to the social organisation of Illyrian tribes in earlier times than the era he lived in makes a distinction between three modes of social organisation. A part of the Illyrians were organized under hereditary kingdoms, a second part was organized under chieftains who were elected but held no hereditary power and some Illyrians were organised in autonomous communities governed by their own internal tribal laws. In these communities social stratification had not yet emerged.

===Warfare===

The history of Illyrian warfare and weaponry spanned from around the 10th century BC up to the 1st century AD in the region defined by the Ancient Greek and Roman historians as Illyria. It concerns the armed conflicts of the Illyrian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkan Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula as well as their pirate activity in the Adriatic Sea within the Mediterranean Sea.

The Illyrians were a notorious seafaring people with a strong reputation for piracy especially common during the regency of king Agron and later queen Teuta. They used fast and maneuverable ships of types known as &quot;lembus&quot; and &quot;liburna&quot; which were subsequently used by the Ancient Macedonians and Romans. Livy described the Illyrians along with the Liburnians and Istrians as nations of savages in general noted for their piracy.

Illyria appears in Greco-Roman historiography from the 4th century BC. Illyrians were regarded as bloodthirsty, unpredictable, turbulent, and warlike by Ancient Greeks and Romans. They were seen as savages on the edge of their world. Polybius (3rd century BC) wrote: &quot;the Romans had freed the Greeks from the enemies of all mankind&quot;. According to the Romans, the Illyrians were tall and well-built. Herodianus writes that &quot;Pannonians are tall and strong always ready for a fight and to face danger but slow witted&quot;. Illyrian rulers wore bronze torques around their necks.

Apart from conflicts between Illyrians and neighbouring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Illyrian tribes too.
==Culture==
===Language===


The languages spoken by the Illyrian tribes are an extinct and poorly attested Indo-European language group, and it is not clear whether the languages belonged to the centum or the satem group. The Illyrians were subject to varying degrees of Celticization, Hellenization, Romanization and later Slavicization which possibly led to the extinction of their languages. In modern research, use of concepts like &quot;Hellenization&quot; and &quot;Romanization&quot; has declined as they have been criticized as simplistic notions which cannot describe the actual processes through which material development moved from the centres of the ancient Mediterranean to its periphery.

The Messapic language is often considered either a dialect or sister language of Illyrian. However, the testimonies of Illyrian are too fragmentary to allow any conclusions. An extinct Indo-European language, Messapic was once spoken in Apulia in the southeastern Italian Peninsula by the three Iapygian tribes of the region: the Messapians, the Daunii and the Peucetii. Based on historical and archaeological data, it has been widely thought that Messapic reached Apulia through the Illyrian migrations across the Adriatic Sea.

On both sides of the border region between southern Illyria and northern Epirus, the contact between the Illyrian and Greek languages produced an area of bilingualism between the two, although it is unclear how the impact of the one language to the other developed because of the scarcity of available archaeological material. However, this did not occur at the same level on both sides, with the Illyrians being more willing to adopt the more prestigious Greek language. Ongoing research may provide further knowledge about these contacts beyond present limited sources. Illyrians were exposed not only to Doric and Epirote Greek but also to Attic-Ionic.

The Illyrian languages were once thought to be connected to the Venetic language in the Italian Peninsula but this view was abandoned. Other scholars have linked them with the adjacent Thracian language supposing an intermediate convergence area or dialect continuum, but this view is also not generally supported. All these languages were likely extinct by the 5th century AD although traditionally, the Albanian language is identified as the descendant of Illyrian dialects that survived in remote areas of the Balkans during the Middle Ages but evidence &quot;is too meager and contradictory for us to know whether the term Illyrian even referred to a single language&quot;.

The ancestor dialects of the Albanian language would have survived somewhere along the boundary of Latin and Ancient Greek linguistic influence, the Jireček Line. There are various modern historians and linguists who believe that the modern Albanian language might have descended from a southern Illyrian dialect whereas an alternative hypothesis holds that Albanian was descended from the Thracian language. Not enough is known of the ancient language to completely prove or disprove either hypothesis, see Origin of the Albanians.

====Linguistic evidence and subgrouping====

Modern studies about Illyrian onomastics, the main field via which the Illyrians have been linguistically investigated as no written records have been found, began in the 1920s and sought to more accurately define Illyrian tribes, the commonalities, relations and differences between each other as they were conditioned by specific local cultural, ecological and economic factors, which further subdivided them into different groupings. This approach has led in contemporary research in the definition of three main onomastic provinces in which Illyrian personal names appear near exclusively in the archaeological material of each province. The southern Illyrian or south-eastern Dalmatian province was the area of the proper Illyrians (the core of which was the territory of &quot;Illyrii proprie dicti&quot; of the classical authors, located in modern Albania) and includes most of Albania, Montenegro and their hinterlands. This area extended along the Adriatic coast from the Aous valley in the south, up to and beyond the Neretva valley in the north. The second onomastic province, the central Illyrian or middle Dalmatian-Pannonian province began to its north and covered a larger area than the southern province. It extended along the Adriatic coast between the Krka and Cetina rivers, covered much of Bosnia (except for its northern regions), central Dalmatia (Lika) and its hinterland in the central Balkans included western Serbia and Sandžak. The third onomastic province further to the north defined as North Adriatic area includes Liburnia and the region of modern Ljubljana in Slovenia. It is part of a larger linguistic area different from Illyrian that also comprises Venetic and its Istrian variety. These areas are not strictly defined geographically as there was some overlap between them. The region of the Dardani (modern Kosovo, parts of northern North Macedonia, parts of eastern Serbia) saw the overlap of the southern Illyrian and Dalmatian onomastic provinces. Local Illyrian anthroponymy is also found in the area.

In its onomastics, southern Illyrian (or south-east Dalmatian) has close relations with Messapic. Most of these relations are shared with the central Dalmatian area. In older scholarship (Crossland (1982)), some toponyms in central and northern Greece show phonetic characteristics that were thought to indicate that Illyrians or closely related peoples were settled in those regions before the introduction of the Greek language. However, such views largely relied on subjective ancient testimonies and are not supported by the earliest evidence (epigraphic etc.).

===Religion===
The Illyrians, as most ancient civilizations, were polytheistic and worshipped many gods and deities developed of the powers of nature. The most numerous traces—still insufficiently studied—of religious practices of the pre-Roman era are those relating to religious symbolism. Symbols are depicted in every variety of ornament and reveal that the chief object of the prehistoric cult of the Illyrians was the Sun, worshipped in a widespread and complex religious system. The solar deity was depicted as a geometrical figure such as the spiral, the concentric circle and the swastika, or as an animal figure the likes of the birds, serpents and horses. The symbols of water-fowl and horses were more common in the north, while the serpent was more common in the south. Illyrian deities were mentioned in inscriptions on statues, monuments, and coins of the Roman period, and some interpreted by Ancient writers through comparative religion. There appears to be no single most prominent god for all the Illyrian tribes, and a number of deities evidently appear only in specific regions.

In Illyris, Dei-pátrous was a god worshiped as the Sky Father, Prende was the love-goddess and the consort of the thunder-god Perendi, En or Enji was the fire-god, Jupiter Parthinus was a chief deity of the Parthini, Redon was a tutelary deity of sailors appearing on many inscriptions in the coastal towns of Lissus, Daorson, Scodra and Dyrrhachium, while Medaurus was the protector deity of Risinium, with a monumental equestrian statue dominating the city from the acropolis. In Dalmatia and Pannonia one of the most popular ritual traditions during the Roman period was the cult of the Roman tutelary deity of the wild, woods and fields Silvanus, depicted with iconography of Pan. The Roman deity of wine, fertility and freedom Liber was worshipped with the attributes of Silvanus, and those of Terminus, the god protector of boundaries. Tadenus was a Dalmatian deity bearing the identity or epithet of Apollo in inscriptions found near the source of the Bosna river. The Delmatae also had Armatus as a war god in Delminium. The Silvanae, a feminine plural of Silvanus, were featured on many dedications across Pannonia. In the hot springs of Topusko (Pannonia Superior), sacrificial altars were dedicated to Vidasus and Thana (identified with Silvanus and Diana), whose names invariably stand side by side as companions. Aecorna or Arquornia was a lake or river tutelary goddess worshipped exclusively in the cities of Nauportus and Emona, where she was the most important deity next to Jupiter. Laburus was also a local deity worshipped in Emona, perhaps a deity protecting the boatmen sailing.

It seems that the Illyrians did not develop a uniform cosmology on which to center their religious practices. A number of Illyrian toponyms and anthroponyms derived from animal names and reflected the beliefs in animals as mythological ancestors and protectors. The serpent was one of the most important animal totems. Illyrians believed in the force of spells and the evil eye, in the magic power of protective and beneficial amulets which could avert the evil eye or the bad intentions of enemies. Human sacrifice also played a role in the lives of the Illyrians. Arrian records the chieftain Cleitus the Illyrian as sacrificing three boys, three girls and three rams just before his battle with Alexander the Great. The most common type of burial among the Iron Age Illyrians was tumulus or mound burial. The kin of the first tumuli was buried around that, and the higher the status of those in these burials the higher the mound. Archaeology has found many artifacts placed within these tumuli such as weapons, ornaments, garments and clay vessels. The rich spectrum in religious beliefs and burial rituals that emerged in Illyria, especially during the Roman period, may reflect the variation in cultural identities in this region.

==Archaeology==


In total, at least six material cultures have been described to have emerged in Illyrian territories. Based on existing archaeological finds, comparative archaeological and geographical definition about them has been difficult. Archaeogenetic studies have shown that a major Y-DNA haplogroup among Illyrians, J2b-L283 spread via Cetina culture across the eastern Adriatic from the Cetina valley in Croatia to Montenegro and northern Albania. The earliest archaeogenetic find related to Cetina in Albania is the Shkrel tumulus (19th century BCE). It is the oldest J2b-L283 find in the region historically known as Illyria. Freilich et al. (2021) determined that Cetina related samples from Veliki Vanik carry similar ancestry to a Copper Age sample from the site of Beli Manastir-Popova Zemlja (late Vučedol culture), eastern Croatia. The same autosomal profile persists in the Iron Age sample from Jazinka cave. Cetina finds have been found in the western Adriatic since the second half of the third millennium in southern Italy. In Albania, new excavations show spread of Cetina culture in sites of central Albania (Blazi, Nezir, Keputa). Inland Cetina spread in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular Kotorac, a site near Sarajevo and contacts have been demonstrated with the Belotić Bela Crkva culture. During the developed Middle Bronze Age, Belotić Bela Crkva which has been recognized as another Proto-Illyrian culture developed in northeastern Bosnia and western Serbia (Čačak area). Both inhumation and cremation have been observed in sites of this culture. Similar burial customs have been observed in the Glasinac plateau of eastern Bosnia, where the Glasinac-Mati culture first developed.

During the 7th century BC, the beginning of the Iron Age, the Illyrians emerge as an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form. Various Illyrian tribes appeared, under the influence of the Halstatt cultures from the north, and they organized their regional centers. The cult of the dead played an important role in the lives of the Illyrians, which is seen in their carefully made burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of the burial sites. In the northern parts of the Balkans, there existed a long tradition of cremation and burial in shallow graves, while in the southern parts, the dead were buried in large stone, or earth tumuli (natively called &quot;gromile&quot;) that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 meters wide and 5 meters high. The &quot;Japodian tribe&quot; (found from Istria in Croatia to Bihać in Bosnia) have had an affinity for decoration with heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze. Small sculptures out of jade in form of archaic Ionian plastic are also characteristically Japodian. Numerous monumental sculptures are preserved, as well as walls of citadel &quot;Nezakcij&quot; near Pula, one of numerous Istrian cities from Iron Age. Illyrian chiefs wore bronze torques around their necks much like the Celts did. The Illyrians were influenced by the Celts in many cultural and material aspects and some of them were Celticized, especially the tribes in Dalmatia and the Pannonians. In Slovenia, the Vače situla was discovered in 1882 and attributed to Illyrians. Prehistoric remains indicate no more than average height, male , female .

===Early Middle Ages===
It is also evident that in a region which stretches from the southern Dalmatian coast, its hinterland, Montenegro, northern Albania up to Kosovo and Dardania, apart from a uniformity in onomastics there were also some archaeological similarities. However, it cannot be determined whether these tribes living there also formed a linguistic unity.

The Komani-Kruja culture is an archaeological culture attested from late antiquity to the Middle Ages in central and northern Albania, southern Montenegro and similar sites in the western parts of North Macedonia. It consists of settlements usually built below hillforts along the Lezhë (Praevalitana)-Dardania and Via Egnatia road networks which connected the Adriatic coastline with the central Balkan Roman provinces. Its type site is Komani and its fort on the nearby Dalmace hill in the Drin river valley. Kruja and Lezha represent significant sites of the culture. The population of Komani-Kruja represents a local, non-Slavic western Balkan people which was linked to the Roman Justinianic military system of forts. The development of Komani-Kruja is significant for the study of the transition between the classical antiquity population of Albania to the medieval Albanians who were attested in historical records in the 11th century. Within Albanian archaeology, based on the continuity of pre-Roman Illyrian forms in the production of several types of local objects found in graves, the population of Komani-Kruja is framed as a group which descended from the local Illyrians who &quot;re-asserted their independence&quot; from the Roman Empire after many centuries and formed the core of the later historical region of Arbanon. Illyrian-Albanian links were the main focus of Albanian nationalism during the Communism period. What was established in this early phase of research was that Komani-Kruja settlements represented a local, non-Slavic population which has been described as Romanized Illyrian, Latin-speaking or Latin-literate. This is corroborated by the absence of Slavic toponyms and survival of Latin ones in the Komani-Kruja area. In terms of historiography, the thesis of older Albanian archaeology is an untestable hypothesis as no historical sources exist which can link Komani-Kruja to the first definite attestation of medieval Albanians in the 11th century. The nationalist interpretation of the Komani-Kruja cemeteries has been roundly rejected by non-Albanian scholars. John Wilkes has described it as &quot;a highly improbable reconstruction of Albanian history&quot;. Some Albanian scholars even today have continued to espouse this model of continuity.

Limited excavations campaigns occurred until the 1990s. Objects from a vast area covering nearby regions the entire Byzantine Empire, the northern Balkans and Hungary and sea routes from Sicily to Crimea were found in Dalmace and other sites coming from many different production centres: local, Byzantine, Sicilian, Avar-Slavic, Hungarian, Crimean and even possibly Merovingian and Carolingian. Within Albanian archaeology, based on the continuity of pre-Roman Illyrian forms in the production of several types of local objects found in graves, the population of Komani-Kruja was framed as a group which descended from the local Illyrians who &quot;re-asserted their independence&quot; from the Roman Empire after many centuries and formed the core of the later historical region of Arbanon. As research focused almost entirely on grave contexts and burial sites, settlements and living spaces were often ignored. Other views stressed that as an archaeological culture it should not be connected to a single social or ethnic group but be contextualized in a broader Roman-Byzantine or Christian framework, nor should material finds be separated in ethnic categories as they cannot be correlated to a specific culture. In this view, cemeteries from nearby regions which were classified as belonging to Slavic groups should not be viewed as necessarily representing another people but as representations of class and other social factors as &quot;ethnic identity was only one factor of varying importance&quot;. Yugoslav archaeology proposed an opposite narrative and tried to frame the population as Slavic, especially in the region of western Macedonia. Archaeological research has shown that these sites were not related to regions then inhabited by Slavs and even in regions like Macedonia, no Slavic settlements had been founded in the 7th century.

Archaeologically, while it was considered possible and even likely that Komani-Kruja sites were used continuously from the 7th century onwards, it remained an untested hypothesis as research was still limited. Whether this population represented local continuity or arrived at an earlier period from a more northern location as the Slavs entered the Balkans remained unclear at the time but regardless of their ultimate geographical origins, these groups maintained Justinianic era cultural traditions of the 6th century possibly as a statement of their collective identity and derived their material cultural references from the Justinianic military system. In this context, they may have used burial customs as a means of reference to an &quot;idealized image of the past Roman power&quot;.

Research greatly expanded after 2009, and the first survey of Komani&#x27;s topography was produced in 2014. Until then, except for the area of the cemetery, the size of the settlement and its extension remained unknown. In 2014, it was revealed that Komani occupied an area of more than 40 ha, a much larger territory than originally thought. Its oldest settlement phase dates to the Hellenistic era. Proper development began in late antiquity and continued well into the Middle Ages (13th-14th centuries). It indicates that Komani was a late Roman fort and an important trading node in the networks of Praevalitana and Dardania. Participation in trade networks of the eastern Mediterranean via sea routes seems to have been very limited even in nearby coastal territory in this era. The collapse of the Roman administration in the Balkans was followed by a broad demographic collapse with the exception of Komani-Kruja and neighbouring mountainous regions. In the Avar-Slavic raids, communities from present-day northern Albania and nearby areas clustered around hill sites for better protection as is the case of other areas like Lezha and Sarda. During the 7th century, as Byzantine authority was reestablished after the Avar-Slavic raids and the prosperity of the settlements increased, Komani saw an increase in population and a new elite began to take shape. Increase in population and wealth was marked by the establishment of new settlements and new churches in their vicinity. Komani formed a local network with Lezha and Kruja and in turn this network was integrated in the wider Byzantine Mediterranean world, maintained contacts with the northern Balkans and engaged in long-distance trade. Winnifrith (2020) recently described this population as the survival of a &quot;Latin-Illyrian&quot; culture which emerged later in historical records as Albanians and Vlachs. In Winnifrith&#x27;s view, the geographical conditions of northern Albania favored the continuation of the Albanian language in hilly and mountainous areas as opposed to lowland valleys. He adds that the language and religion of this culture remain uncertain. With bishops absent abroad, &quot;the mountain flocks cannot have been too versed in theological or linguistic niceties&quot;.

==Nationalism==
===Albanians===

The possible continuity between the Illyrian populations of the Western Balkans in antiquity and the Albanians has played a significant role in Albanian nationalism from the 19th century until the present day.

===South Slavs===

At the beginning of the 19th century, many educated Europeans, regarded the South Slavs as the descendants of ancient Illyrians. When Napoleon conquered part of the South Slavic lands, these areas were named after ancient Illyrian provinces (1809–1814). The French imperial administration regarded the South Slavs as Illyrians speaking the Illyrian language, however this was based on a poor knowledge of history and ethnology. After the demise of the First French Empire in 1815, the Habsburg monarchy became increasingly centralized and authoritarian, and fear of Magyarization arouse patriotic resistance among Croatians. Under the influence of Romantic nationalism, a self-identified &quot;Illyrian movement&quot;, in the form of a Croatian national revival, opened a literary and journalistic campaign initiated by a group of young Croatian intellectuals during the years of 1835–49.

<text>Gary Ronnie Stewart (May 28, 1944 – December 16, 2003) was an American musician and songwriter, known for his distinctive vibrato voice and his outlaw country sound influenced by southern rock. At the height of his popularity in the mid-1970s, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described him as the &quot;king of honkytonk.&quot; He had a series of country chart hits from the mid- to late 1970s, the biggest of which was &quot;She&#x27;s Actin&#x27; Single (I&#x27;m Drinkin&#x27; Doubles)&quot;, which topped the U.S. country singles chart in 1975.

On December 16, 2003, Stewart died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, one month after the death of his wife.

== Career ==

Learning guitar and piano, Stewart began touring with local bands and writing songs in his teens. He married Mary Lou Taylor, who was more than three years his senior, at age seventeen and began working days in an airplane factory. He still played in rock and country bands at night. While playing in an Okeechobee, Florida, honky-tonk known as the Wagon Wheel, Stewart met country singer Mel Tillis, who advised Stewart to travel to Nashville to pitch his songs. He recorded a few songs for the small Cory label in 1964 and began co-writing songs with local policeman Bill Eldridge. Stewart and Eldridge wrote Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s 1965 country hit, &quot;Poor Red Georgia Dirt&quot;. Signed to the Kapp label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings but several songwriting successes followed, for artists like Billy Walker (&quot;She Goes Walking Through My Mind&quot;, &quot;Traces of a Woman&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Love Her&quot;), Cal Smith (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Housebreak a Tomcat&quot;, &quot;It Takes Me All Night Long&quot;), and Nat Stuckey (&quot;Sweet Thang And Cisco&quot;). He even played piano for a time in Charley Pride&#x27;s band the Pridesmen, and can be heard on Pride&#x27;s live &quot;In Person&quot; double-album. Disappointed with Music Row, however, he soon returned to Florida and resumed playing countrified rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in local clubs and bars. In 1970 Motown Records, hoping to get Nashville artists to record their songs, paid Stewart $30 to record countrified demos of &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot;, &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)&quot;.

== Peak of career ==
Stewart was dropped from Kapp and then from Decca, but a series of demo tapes, including the countrified Motown tunes, found their way into the hands of producer Roy Dea, who convinced Jerry Bradley to sign Stewart to RCA Records. He returned to Nashville in 1973 and recorded a cover version of &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot; by the Allman Brothers, both of whom were Stewart&#x27;s personal friends. It charted at only #63 on the country chart, but his follow-up, 1974&#x27;s &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Thing&quot; became a top ten hit. His album &quot;Out of Hand&quot; was released in early 1975. &quot;Out of Hand&quot;, the title cut, became a #4 country hit and was followed by the #1 hit &quot;She&#x27;s Actin&#x27; Single (I&#x27;m Drinkin&#x27; Doubles)&quot;.

The album &quot;Out of Hand&quot;, which climbed to #6 on the Billboard country album chart, has since become one of the most critically lauded country albums of the 1970s. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A− saying that it &quot;was the best regular issue country LP I&#x27;ve heard in about five years.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it high praise as well, stating that, &quot;With practitioners like Stewart around, honky-tonk—and rockabilly—may not be dead yet.&quot; Thom Jurek of AllMusic later gave the album five of five stars and stated that a &quot;strong case could be made for &quot;Out of Hand&quot; as one of the Top 100 country records of all time. It might be in this writer&#x27;s Top Ten!&quot; Country music critic Bill Malone called &quot;Out of Hand&quot; &quot;one of the greatest honky-tonk country albums ever recorded.&quot;

Later in 1975, MCA released Stewart&#x27;s old Kapp material scoring a #15 hit with the single &quot;You&#x27;re Not the Woman You Use to Be&quot;. For the rest of the 1970s Stewart played the honky tonks with his road band, The Honky Tonk Liberation Army, and recorded similar albums with modest success for RCA: 1976&#x27;s &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;; 1977&#x27;s &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot; (which featured guest artists Nicolette Larson, Emmylou Harris, and Rodney Crowell); and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Little Junior&quot;. These albums spawned several hit singles, including: &quot;Flat Natural Born Good-Timin&#x27; Man&quot;, &quot;In Some Room Above the Street&quot;, &quot;Single Again&quot;, &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot;, &quot;Quits&quot;, and &quot;Whiskey Trip&quot;. His 1977 ode to marital distress entitled &quot;Ten Years of This&quot;, from the album &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot;, was a favorite of Bob Dylan and a #16 hit. Dylan noted his admiration of Stewart in a 1978 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Later career==
Though his late 1970s albums were well received by critics and his core fans, Stewart never established a large rapport with the general music audience. He was often labeled as &quot;too country&quot; for rock listeners and &quot;too rock&quot; for country fans. In 1980, he released the Chips Moman-produced &quot;Cactus and a Rose&quot; which featured Southern rockers Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Mike Lawler, and Bonnie Bramlett. It did not garner much airplay and RCA teamed Stewart up with songwriter Dean Dillon for a pair of duet records. Soon after, Stewart returned to Florida, where alcoholism and drug use kept him from recording for much of the 1980s. His son, Gary Joseph Stewart, committed suicide late in the decade as well. Stewart signed with the HighTone label in 1988 and recorded three albums over the next five years. These albums included fan favorites like the minor hit &quot;An Empty Glass (That&#x27;s the Way the Day Ends)&quot; (written by Stewart and Dillon), &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Jukin&#x27;&quot; (written by Stewart and Betts), and &quot;Brand New Whiskey&quot; (written by Stewart and his wife).

Stewart continued to tour through the 1990s, playing venues such as Fort Worth&#x27;s Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas several times a year. During this time, Bob Dylan, while touring with Tom Petty in Florida, drove out of his way to meet Stewart, &quot;confessing that he&#x27;d played Stewart&#x27;s ode to marital malaise &#x27;Ten Years of This&#x27; over and over, the record casting a spell over him.&quot; In 2003, Stewart released &quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;, his first album in ten years and his first-ever live album. Reviewers at Allmusic gave it good marks.

==Personal life==
Stewart was born in Jenkins, Kentucky, on May 28, 1944, the son of George and Georgia Stewart. He was named after the actor Gary Cooper. In 1959 his father, a coal miner, sustained an injury while working in the mines, and shortly afterwards the family moved to Fort Pierce, a city on Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast.

On November 26, 2003, the day before Thanksgiving, his wife of nearly 43 years, Mary Lou, died of pneumonia. Stewart, who had been scheduled to play Billy Bob&#x27;s three days later, canceled his concert appearances. His friends later told reporters that he was extremely despondent after Mary Lou&#x27;s death. 

On December 16, his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend and Stewart&#x27;s very close friend, Bill Hardman, visited his Fort Pierce, Florida, home to check on his welfare. They found Stewart dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck.

==Posthumous releases==
In 2005, the Australia-based Raven Records released a CD containing Stewart&#x27;s second and fourth albums: &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; and &quot;Little Junior&quot;, augmented with three previously unreleased bonus tracks from the RCA vaults. It was followed by a second Raven release containing &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; and &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, expanded and augmented by rare bonus tracks which were previously unavailable on CD. Two songs from the era featured on this collection later became hits when recorded by George Strait.

Wounded Bird Records released a CD in 2010 which included the albums &quot;Cactus and a Rose&quot; and &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot;, a comprehensive greatest hits collection. In 2010, UK-based Floating World Records reissued Stewart&#x27;s albums from the late 1980s and early 1990s: &quot;Brand New&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Texan&quot;. Floating World purchased the entire back catalog from the now-defunct HighTone label. In 2013, UK-based Morello Records released a CD containing Stewart&#x27;s first and third albums: &quot;Out of Hand&quot; and &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot;. In 2017, Morello released a CD containing Stewart&#x27;s fifth and sixth albums: &quot;Gary&quot; and &quot;Cactus and a Rose&quot;.

For Record Store Day in 2018, the Delmore Recording Society label released a 45 rpm single called &quot;Mowtown&quot; containing Stewart&#x27;s versions of the Motown classics &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot; and &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot;. Stewart recorded the tracks (and the unreleased &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)&quot;) in 1970 when Motown Records wanted demos of their songs in a Nashville style, hoping to interest country music artists in recording Motown songs. Stewart was paid $30 for the session.

In May 2020, the Austin-based band Mike and the Moonpies released &quot;Touch of You: The Lost Songs of Gary Stewart&quot;, an album of unreleased songs written or co-written by Stewart. The band&#x27;s version of Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Smooth Shot of Whiskey&quot;, featuring Mark Wystrach of the band Midland was released as a single.

<text>GKN Ltd is a British multinational automotive and aerospace components business headquartered in Redditch, England. It was a long-running business known for many decades as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds. It can trace its origins back to 1759 and the birth of the Industrial Revolution. In 2018 GKN plc was acquired by Melrose Industries plc in a hostile takeover. Melrose divested GKN Automotive and GKN Powder Metallurgy in 2023 and listed them as Dowlais Group on the London Stock Exchange. GKN Aerospace continues to be owned by Melrose plc. 

Throughout the majority of the twentieth century, though steel production remained the core of GKN it branched into tooling and component manufacturing. It was deeply impacted by government policies during the latter half of the century, during which Britain&#x27;s steel industry was subject to multiple nationalisation and privatisation efforts. During the 1980s, GKN Steel reduced its presence in the steel sector, selling off or shutting down its works.

GKN Steel renamed itself GKN during 1986 to indicate its shift away from steel production. Business activities were re-orientated around the aerospace, automotive and industrial services markets. In 1994, GKN purchased Westland Aircraft. The company later organised a joint venture of Westland&#x27;s helicopter interests with Agusta to form AgustaWestland and its sale to Italian defense firm Finmeccanica. During November 1995, Dana Corporation purchased GKN&#x27;s axle group; the two firms continued to operate joint ventures in the field for many years. 

During the early 2000s, it took over Tochigi Fuji Sangyo K.K, a Japanese manufacturer of differentials and driveline torque systems. During December 2011, GKN Aerospace Engineering services division was sold to product engineering firm Quest Global. In 2012, GKN acquired the Swedish aerospace engine specialist Volvo Aero. During 2018, Melrose Industries acquired GKN with a £8.1 billion deal.

== Name ==
The company&#x27;s name is the initials of three early figures in its history: John Guest, Arthur Keen, and Joseph Henry Nettlefold. All three were key figures in the field of iron and steel during the Industrial Revolution. Ivor Guest sold the &quot;Dowlais Iron Company&quot; in Wales to Arthur Keen and Windsor Richards of Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Patent Nut and Bolt Company&quot; in June 1900. 

They combined the two businesses and formed &quot;Guest, Keen &amp; Co. Limited&quot; on 1 November 1900. A little over twelve months later, Guest Keen &amp; Co bought and amalgamated &quot;Nettlefolds Limited&quot; into their new combine giving it the style &quot;Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds Limited&quot;. 

==History==

===1759 to 1900===
The origins of GKN lie in the founding of the Dowlais Ironworks in the village of Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, by Thomas Lewis and Isaac Wilkinson. John Guest was appointed manager of the works in 1767, having moved from Broseley. In 1786, Guest was succeeded by his son, Thomas Guest, who formed the Dowlais Iron Company with his son-in-law William Taitt. Guest introduced many innovations and the works prospered.

Under Guest&#x27;s leadership, alongside his manager John Evans, and after his death in 1852 that of his wife Lady Charlotte Guest, the Dowlais Ironworks gained the reputation of being &quot;one of the World&#x27;s great industrial concerns&quot;. 
Though the Bessemer process was licensed in 1856, nine years of detailed planning and project management were needed before the first steel was produced. The company thrived with its new cost-effective production methods, forming alliances with the Consett Iron Company and Krupp. By 1857, G.T. Clark and William Menelaus, his manager, had constructed the &quot;Goat Mill&quot;, the world&#x27;s most powerful rolling mill.

By the mid-1860s, Clark&#x27;s reforms had borne fruit in renewed profitability. Clark delegated day-to-day management to Menelaus, his trusteeship terminating in 1864 when ownership passed to Sir Ivor Guest. Clark continued to direct policy, building a new plant at the docks at Cardiff and vetoing a joint-stock company. He formally retired in 1897.

===1900 to 1966===
On 9 July 1900, the Dowlais Iron Company and Arthur Keen&#x27;s &quot;Patent Nut and Bolt Company&quot; merged to form &quot;Guest, Keen &amp; Co. Ltd&quot;.

&quot;Nettlefolds Limited&quot;, a leading manufacturer of fasteners, established in Smethwick, West Midlands in 1854, was acquired in 1902, leading to the change of name to &quot;Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds&quot; (GKN).

In 1920 John Lysaght and Co. was acquired.

====Guest Keen Baldwins====
Steel production remained at the core of the company, but under increasing profit margin pressure. In 1930, the company combined its steel production business with that of rival Baldwins to form &quot;Guest Keen Baldwins&quot;, which now held:
* Baldwins: Coke ovens at Margam; Blast-furnaces and steel melting shop at Margam; steel works and rolling mills at Port Talbot; blast-furnaces at Briton Ferry; lime stone quarry at Cornelly
* GKN: Dowlais Iron and Steel Works; Cardiff Iron and Steel Works; coke ovens at Cwmbran; limestone and silica quarries

In 1935, the company demolished the Cardiff works to construct a new production facility on the same site, funded by an issue of debentures. Due to a resultant global shortage of pig iron, in 1937, the company fired-up the single remaining blast furnace at Dowlais.

During the Second World War, all of the sites were heavily bombed by Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe, and the required investment meant that all of these assets were nationalised as part of the Iron and Steel Act 1949, resultantly becoming part of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain.

GKN were still highly reliant on the supply of good quality steel thus, in 1954, the business negotiated from the asset realisation company the repurchase of key assets from ISC, which were renamed &quot;Guest Keen Iron and Steel Co.&quot; In 1961, the company&#x27;s name was changed again to &quot;GKN Steel Company&quot;.

====Fasteners====
These mergers heralded half a century in which &quot;GKN&quot; became a major manufacturer of screws, nuts, bolts and other fasteners. The company reflected the vertical integration fashionable at the time embracing activities from coal and ore extraction, and iron and steel making to manufacturing finished goods.

====Crankshafts====
After the First World War, it became apparent that Britain was likely to follow France and the United States in developing a large scale automotive industry. During 1919, GKN acquired another fastener manufacturer, F. W. Cotterill Ltd. Cotterill owned a subsidiary named J. W. Garrington, which specialised in forgings; the forgings produced at the Garrington Darlaston plant, later supplemented by a large plant at Bromsgrove, enabled GKN to become a major supplier of crankshafts, connecting rods, half-shafts and numerous smaller forged components to the UK auto-industry, which had a period of massive expansion during the interwar period and beyond.

====Pressed steel wheels====
Another company, eventually acquired by GKN, was founded by another steel manufacturing entrepreneur, Joseph Sankey. After training as a mechanical engineer in the late 19th century, Sankey founding a company that became a major producer of tea trays. A pioneering motorist, Sankey became friends with figures such as Herbert Austin, and was also a supplier of sheet steel components to the nascent British car industry. Because the wooden wheels on early cars had a tendency to disintegrate after hitting roadside kerbs, Sankey developed a pioneering pressed-steel wheel. Production started in 1908, with customers including Austin Motor Company and, later, William Morris. In addition to Sankey&#x27;s original factory at Bilston, a new plant was established near Wellington, Shropshire, which was devoted to wheel production and known as GKN Sankey.

Meanwhile, by 1914, GKN&#x27;s customers for sheet-steel vehicle bodies had also come to include Austin, along with Daimler, Humber, Rover, Star and Argyll.

After John Lysaght acquired Joseph Sankey and Sons Ltd, GKN purchased both companies, in 1920.

By the 1960s, GKN was manufacturing many other kinds of automotive components, including chassis for the Triumph Herald and its derivatives. The company also developed the GKN FV432 armoured personnel carrier. By 1969, the highly-automated GKN Wheels Wellington plant was producing over 5½ million wheels per year, with a maximum rate of approximately 30,000 units per day.

====Nationalisation of steel====
The postwar government nationalised the steel industry under Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. The act of parliament of 1949 took effect in February 1951.

In 1951, a new subsidiary Blade Research &amp; Development (BRD) was formed at Aldridge, Staffordshire, to produce aero-engine turbine blades. Following a fall in demand for turbine blades in the late 1950s, the BRD factory switched to producing constant-velocity joints and driveshafts for vehicles.

In 1953, Britain&#x27;s steel industry was de-nationalised by a new government; this policy only lasted for 14 years before being reversed.

===1966 to 1991===
At the end of April 1965, the recently elected Labour government published a White Paper proposing the nationalisation of 90 per cent, by output, of Britain&#x27;s steel industry. GKN Steel was transferred to public ownership at the end of July 1967.

====Driveline====
Beginning a programme of diversification into the automotive field in 1966 GKN bought BRD&#x27;s much larger competitor, Birfield Ltd, which held the great bulk of the British market for CVJs, constant velocity joints, and was a company that since 1938 had incorporated both the Sheffield based Laycock Engineering later best known as a postwar overdrive manufacturer, and Hardy Spicer Limited of Birmingham, England, also a manufacturer of constant-velocity joints. Historically, such joints had few applications, even following the improved design proposed by Alfred H. Rzeppa in 1936. However, in 1959, Alec Issigonis had developed the revolutionary Mini motor car that relied on the Hardy Spicer joints for its front wheel drive technology. The massive expansion in the exploitation of front wheel drive in the 1970s and 1980s led to the acquisition of other similar businesses and a 43% share of the world market by 2002.

On the death of founder Tony Vandervell in 1967, GKN acquired the lucrative Maidenhead-based Vandervell bearing manufacturer that was at the time exporting more than 50% of its output to overseas vehicle manufacturers. This was part of a larger trend for GKN that during this period, under its Managing Director Raymond Brookes, was working to reduce its dependence on UK auto-maker customers at a time when the domestic industry was seen to be stumbling, in response to bewildering &quot;Government interference and fiscal short-sightedness&quot;, with British new car registrations in the first four months of 1969 a massive 33% down on the corresponding period of the previous year.

As a result of the large number of mergers, Abram Games was commissioned to develop a new corporate identity in 1969 when the distinctive angular GKN symbol was created and the new company colours of blue and white introduced. In 1974, GKN acquired Kirkstall Forge Engineering, a manufacturer of truck axles in Leeds.

====GKN Steel====
By 1968, GKN Steel had recreated its downline business, and started to build its upline business through aggressive building of a steel stockholding business. In 1972, it acquired Firth Cleveland, a hot and cold rolled strip business with a downline in sintered products, reinforcement steels, wire fasteners and garage equipment. In 1973, GKN Steel exchanged the remaining assets at Dowlais along with £30 million in cash to the nationalised British Steel Corporation, in return for the previously nationalised Brymbo Steelworks. After acquiring steel stockholding competitor Miles Druce and Co, by 1974, the company was in possession of a full integrated steel production and manufacturing business.

By the late 1980s, in the face of extensive competition from Japanese firms in both the axle and constant velocity joint business, GKN Steel decided to start selling off its steel and fasteners businesses. By 1991, the firm had disposed of all of the assets within these two business lines. GKN Steel&#x27;s withdrawal coincidence with the wider closure of multiple steelworks and heavy industries across Britain, which caused considerable social disruption in some areas at the time, thus becoming a topic of political debate. In 1989, GKN Steel&#x27;s factory at Bilston, in the West Midlands, was permanently closed and subsequently demolished.

===1990s===
Having disposed of its steel production asset, the company renamed itself &quot;GKN&quot; in 1986. The firm focused on military vehicles, aerospace and industrial services. During the 1990s, GKN completed a series of large acquisitions and industrial consolidations. During 1994, the firm acquired the helicopter manufacturing business of Westland Aircraft. In 1998, GKN&#x27;s armoured vehicle business was sold to Alvis plc; this division was subsequently incorporated into Alvis Vickers Ltd.

During November 1995, associate Dana Corporation purchased GKN&#x27;s axle group; at that time, GKN held 34% of the world market for constant velocity joints. Around this same time period, GKN acquired larger shares of its other driveline joint ventures with Dana in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. From the late 1990s, the company built up a major global business in powder metallurgy, which operates as the GKN Powdered Metallurgy group.

During early 1998, GKN and Italian aerospace company Finmeccanica commenced discussions on the topic of merging their helicopter operations; French aerospace conglomerate Aérospatiale had also reportedly made its own approaches around this time.

=== 2000s ===
In July 2000, GKN and Finmeccanica announced an agreement to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries, Westland and Agusta respectively, to form AgustaWestland. On 20 May 2004, GKN confirmed that it was holding discussions to sell its 50% shareholding in AgustaWestland to Finmeccanica. The sale of this stake in exchange for £1 billion ($1.79 billion) from Finmeccanica was finalised later that year.

In 2002, GKN acquired a significant stake in – and by 2004 took over the whole concern of – the Japanese manufacturer of differentials and driveline torque systems Tochigi Fuji Sangyo K.K, based in Tochigi, Tochigi. GKN went on to acquire Monitor Aerospace Corp in Amityville, New York and Precision Machining in Wellington, Kansas in 2006, part of the Airbus plant at Filton near Bristol for £150 million in 2008 and all of Getrag&#x27;s axle business and axle manufacturing facilities in 2011.

=== 2010s ===
During December 2011, GKN Aerospace Engineering services division was acquired by product engineering firm Quest Global. The sale was accompanied by an agreement for QuestGlobal to provide engineering resources to GKN Aerospace; this cooperation was presented as a long-term strategy.

In July 2012, GKN agreed to acquire the Swedish aerospace components manufacturer Volvo Aero from AB Volvo for £633 million (US$986 million). The takeover was seen as presenting good opportunities for the expansion of Volvo Aero&#x27;s range of engine component production range via GKN&#x27;s experience in producing aerostructures. In October 2015, GKN acquired Dutch aerospace company Fokker Technologies through a €706 million deal. GKN Aerospace chief Kevin Cummings stated that the Fokker purchase enhances GKN&#x27;s global manufacturing footprint and brought new technology to the company.

Throughout the 2010s, there was strong demand for GKN&#x27;s aerostructures; earlier, the company had secured manufacturing contracts to produce elements of the Boeing 787, Airbus A350 XWB, Airbus A400M Atlas, and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, in addition to numerous other aircraft. During early 2011, it was announced that GKN and EADS would cooperate on developing radical additive layer manufacturing technology for aerospace purposes. That same year, the Honda Aircraft Company picked GKN to produce the whole composite fuselage of its Honda HA-420 HondaJet at the latter&#x27;s facility in Alabama. In late 2012, it opened a new composite manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico. During the same year, GKN was contracted to provide fuselage components for the Bell 525 Relentless helicopter.

During January 2018, Melrose Industries announced plans to purchase GKN and its restructuring thereafter; that same month, GKN&#x27;s management rejected the initial bid made. In March 2018, Melrose submitted a revised £8.1 billion bid for the company; this bid was controversial and was subject to criticism, being branded by some press agencies as a hostile takeover. Melrose&#x27;s offer received shareholder support and was accepted. Following a formal review of the purchase, including of various objections put forward by GKN workers and trade unions, the UK Government allowed the transaction to proceed in April 2018; Melrose agreed to comply with several national security measures.

Since the takeover by Melrose plc, the GKN legacy group of businesses were decentralised in a move toward maximizing profitable sales in favour of focusing on pure growth of sales numbers. By the end of 2019, GKN had been restructured into three core divisions: GKN Aerospace, GKN Automotive and GKN Powder Metallurgy.

=== 2020s ===
On 9 July 2021, 422 workers of GKN&#x27;s factory in Florence, Italy were notified that the factory was to be closed the next Monday. The same day, the unions organized a demonstration in front of the factory, and then occupied it. A workers&#x27; collective was formed with the objective of taking a shareholding in the business.

In March 2023, Melrose announced that it would demerge GKN Automotive and GKN Powder Metallurgy as Dowlais Group.

<doc id="424539" wikidata="Q2453267" url="?curid=424539" title="Kilkenny Castle">
<text>Kilkenny Castle ( ) is a castle in Kilkenny, Ireland, built in 1260 to control a fording-point of the River Nore and the junction of several routeways. It was a symbol of Norman occupation, and in its original 13th-century condition, it would have formed an important element of the town&#x27;s defences with four large circular corner towers and a massive ditch, part of which can still be seen today on the Parade.

In 1967, Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde, sold the castle for £50 to the Castle Restoration Committee for the people of Kilkenny. The castle and grounds are now managed by the Office of Public Works, and the gardens and parkland are open to the public. The Parade Tower is a conference venue. Since 2002, ceremonies for conferring awards and degrees on the graduates of the Kilkenny Campus of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, have been held at the castle.

==History==


===Early history===
Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, commonly known as &quot;Strongbow&quot; constructed the first castle, probably a wooden structure, in the 12th century. The Anglo-Normans had established a castle in 1173, possibly on the site of an earlier residence of the Mac Giolla Phádraig kings of Osraighe. Kilkenny formed part of the lordship of Leinster, which was granted to Strongbow. Strongbow&#x27;s daughter and heiress, Isabel married William Marshall in 1189.

Marshall owned large estates in Ireland, England, Wales and France and managed them effectively. In 1192, he appointed Geoffrey FitzRobert as seneschal of Leinster and so began a major phase of development in Kilkenny, including the development of Kilkenny Castle. The first stone castle on the site, was completed in 1260. This was a square-shaped castle with towers at each corner; three of these original four towers survive to this day.

The castle was owned by the seneschal of Kilkenny Sir Gilbert De Bohun who inherited the county of Kilkenny and castle from his mother in 1270, in 1300 he was outlawed by Edward I but was reinstated in 1303, he held the castle until his death in 1381. It was not granted to his heir Joan, but seized by the crown and sold to the Butler family in 1391.

=== Butlers of Ormonde ===
The Butler family (who changed their name from FitzWalter in 1185) arrived in Ireland with the Norman invasion. They originally settled in Gowran where James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond built Gowran Castle in 1385. The family had become wealthy and James bought Kilkenny Castle in 1391 and established himself as ruler of the area. The Butler dynasty then ruled the surrounding area for centuries. Many of the family, including James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond are buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church Gowran.

Among the many notable members of the Butler family was Lady Margaret Butler (c. 1454 or 1465–1539) the Irish noblewoman, the daughter of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. Lady Margaret Butler was born in Kilkenny Castle. She married Sir William Boleyn and was the paternal grandmother of Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII of England.

=== Confederate Ireland ===
In the 17th century, the castle came into the hands of Elizabeth Preston, wife of then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond. Butler, unlike most of his family, was a Protestant and throughout the Irish Confederate Wars of the 1640s was the representative of Charles I in Ireland. However, his castle became the capital of a Catholic rebel movement, Confederate Ireland, whose parliament or &quot;Supreme Council&quot; met in Kilkenny Castle from 1642 to 1648. Ormonde himself was based in Dublin at this time. The east wall and the northeast tower of the Castle were damaged in 1650 during the siege of Kilkenny by Oliver Cromwell during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. They were later torn down. Then, in 1661, Butler remodelled the castle as a &quot;modern&quot; château after his return from exile.

By the 18th century, the castle had become run down, reflecting the failing fortunes of the Butler family. However, some restoration was carried out by Anne Wandesford of Castlecomer, who brought wealth back into the family upon marrying John Butler, 17th Earl of Ormonde. In the 19th century, the Butlers then attempted to restore it to its original medieval appearance, also rebuilding the north wing and extending the south curtain wall. More extensions were added in 1854. In 1904, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and his wife Queen Alexandra visited Kilkenny Castle.

The family disposed of the bulk of their tenanted estates in Tipperary and Kilkenny, 21,000 acres (85 km2), by 1915 for £240,000. James Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde, died in 1919. Death duties and expenses following his death amounted to £166,000.

As Lord Ormonde had only two daughters, it was agreed that, in order to reduce the double-taxation of the estate, his brother and heir, Arthur Butler, 4th Marquess of Ormonde would forgo his inheritance in favour of his son, George Butler, 5th Marquess of Ormonde who used the courtesy title &#x27;Earl of Ossory&#x27;. Lord and Lady Ossory took up residence in the Castle in 1921, with their children Antony, Viscount Thurles and Lady Moyra Butler.

In 1922, during the Irish Civil War, Republicans were besieged in the Castle by Irish Free State forces. The Ormondes, together with their pet Pekinese, chose to remain &quot;in situ&quot; in their bedroom over the great gate, which was the main focus of attack. There was a machine gun outside their door. Only one man was injured but a great deal of damage was inflicted on the castle, which took many years to repair.

George Butler, Earl of Ossory and his family remained living in the castle until 1935, when they sold its contents for £6,000, moved to London, and abandoned it for thirty years. The impact of rising taxes, death duties, economic depression and living costs had taken their toll. While the Ormondes had received £22,000 in rental income in the 1880s, investment income in the 1930s was in the region of £9,000 and by 1950 these investments yielded only £850.

In 1938, Arthur, George and Antony Butler agreed to resettle the Trust in which the estates were held. Antony Butler, Viscount Thurles died unexpectedly in 1940, and therefore after the death of the 4th Marquess in 1943 and the 5th Marquess in 1949, the estate was inherited by Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess and 24th Earl of Ormonde.

In 1967, this Lord Ormonde sold the abandoned and deteriorating castle to the Castle Restoration Committee for a ceremonial £50, with the statement: &quot;The people of Kilkenny, as well as myself and my family, feel a great pride in the Castle, and we have not liked to see this deterioration. We determined that it should not be allowed to fall into ruins. There are already too many ruins in Ireland.&quot; He also bought the land in front of the castle from the trustees &quot;in order that it should never be built on and the castle would be seen in all its dignity and splendour&quot;. The handover ceremony also marked the foundation of The Butler Society, a still thriving organisation that connects, preserves and unites a family once dominant in the British Isles. Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull turned up at the castle hand over party, with Jagger telling the newspapers &quot;We just came to loon about.&quot; It now belongs to the people of Kilkenny.

=== Restoration ===
The rest of the 20th century saw a large amount of restoration and maintenance take place, as well as the castle being opened to visitors.

==Butler Gallery==
The Butler Gallery, previously based in the basement of Kilkenny Castle, is located in the redeveloped Evans&#x27; Home, a former almshouse built in the 19th century for impoverished domestic servants. It holds rotating exhibitions put on by the Kilkenny Art Gallery Society in a venue named for Peggy and Hubert Butler.

==Excavations==
Excavations and building surveys by Ben Murtagh in the 1990s revealed traces of an earlier castle, exposed a postern gate (side entrance) and section of the castle ditch facing on to the Parade (now visible), and also partly uncovered the lost south-east side of the castle. The entrance was through the (now missing) east wall. Various other features of the original castle have also been excavated, including original stone buttressing and a garderobe. Excavations in 2019 by Cóilín Ó Drisceoil uncovered the foundations of the great gatehouse, built by William Marshal in the early 1200s. 

=== Weather record ===
Ireland&#x27;s highest officially recognised air temperature, , was measured at Kilkenny Castle on 26 June 1887.

<text>In the general theory of relativity, the Einstein field equations (EFE; also known as Einstein&#x27;s equations) relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter within it.

The equations were published by Albert Einstein in 1915 in the form of a tensor equation which related the local &quot;&quot; (expressed by the Einstein tensor) with the local energy, momentum and stress within that spacetime (expressed by the stress–energy tensor).

Analogously to the way that electromagnetic fields are related to the distribution of charges and currents via Maxwell&#x27;s equations, the EFE relate the spacetime geometry to the distribution of mass–energy, momentum and stress, that is, they determine the metric tensor of spacetime for a given arrangement of stress–energy–momentum in the spacetime. The relationship between the metric tensor and the Einstein tensor allows the EFE to be written as a set of nonlinear partial differential equations when used in this way. The solutions of the EFE are the components of the metric tensor. The inertial trajectories of particles and radiation (geodesics) in the resulting geometry are then calculated using the geodesic equation.

As well as implying local energy–momentum conservation, the EFE reduce to Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation in the limit of a weak gravitational field and velocities that are much less than the speed of light.

Exact solutions for the EFE can only be found under simplifying assumptions such as symmetry. Special classes of exact solutions are most often studied since they model many gravitational phenomena, such as rotating black holes and the expanding universe. Further simplification is achieved in approximating the spacetime as having only small deviations from flat spacetime, leading to the linearized EFE. These equations are used to study phenomena such as gravitational waves.

==Mathematical form==

The Einstein field equations (EFE) may be written in the form:

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the Einstein tensor, formula_3 is the metric tensor, formula_4 is the stress–energy tensor, formula_5 is the cosmological constant and formula_6 is the Einstein gravitational constant.

The Einstein tensor is defined as
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the Ricci curvature tensor, and formula_9 is the scalar curvature. This is a symmetric second-degree tensor that depends on only the metric tensor and its first and second derivatives.

The Einstein gravitational constant is defined as
:formula_10 or formula_11
where is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and is the speed of light in vacuum.

The EFE can thus also be written as
:formula_12

In standard units, each term on the left has units of 1/length2.

The expression on the left represents the curvature of spacetime as determined by the metric; the expression on the right represents the stress–energy–momentum content of spacetime. The EFE can then be interpreted as a set of equations dictating how stress–energy–momentum determines the curvature of spacetime.

These equations, together with the geodesic equation, which dictates how freely falling matter moves through spacetime, form the core of the mathematical formulation of general relativity.

The EFE is a tensor equation relating a set of symmetric 4 × 4 tensors. Each tensor has 10 independent components. The four Bianchi identities reduce the number of independent equations from 10 to 6, leaving the metric with four gauge-fixing degrees of freedom, which correspond to the freedom to choose a coordinate system.

Although the Einstein field equations were initially formulated in the context of a four-dimensional theory, some theorists have explored their consequences in dimensions. The equations in contexts outside of general relativity are still referred to as the Einstein field equations. The vacuum field equations (obtained when is everywhere zero) define Einstein manifolds.

The equations are more complex than they appear. Given a specified distribution of matter and energy in the form of a stress–energy tensor, the EFE are understood to be equations for the metric tensor formula_3, since both the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature depend on the metric in a complicated nonlinear manner. When fully written out, the EFE are a system of ten coupled, nonlinear, hyperbolic-elliptic partial differential equations.

===Sign convention===
The above form of the EFE is the standard established by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (MTW). The authors analyzed conventions that exist and classified these according to three signs ([S1] [S2] [S3]):

formula_14

The third sign above is related to the choice of convention for the Ricci tensor:
formula_15

With these definitions Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler classify themselves as , whereas Weinberg (1972) is , Peebles (1980) and Efstathiou et al. (1990) are , Rindler (1977), Atwater (1974), Collins Martin &amp; Squires (1989) and Peacock (1999) are .

Authors including Einstein have used a different sign in their definition for the Ricci tensor which results in the sign of the constant on the right side being negative:
formula_16

The sign of the cosmological term would change in both these versions if the metric sign convention is used rather than the MTW metric sign convention adopted here.

===Equivalent formulations===
Taking the trace with respect to the metric of both sides of the EFE one gets
formula_17
where is the spacetime dimension. Solving for and substituting this in the original EFE, one gets the following equivalent &quot;trace-reversed&quot; form:
formula_18

In dimensions this reduces to
formula_19

Reversing the trace again would restore the original EFE. The trace-reversed form may be more convenient in some cases (for example, when one is interested in weak-field limit and can replace formula_3 in the expression on the right with the Minkowski metric without significant loss of accuracy).

==The cosmological constant==
In the Einstein field equations
formula_21
the term containing the cosmological constant was absent from the version in which he originally published them. Einstein then included the term with the cosmological constant to allow for a universe that is not expanding or contracting. This effort was unsuccessful because:
* any desired steady state solution described by this equation is unstable, and
* observations by Edwin Hubble showed that our universe is expanding.

Einstein then abandoned , remarking to George Gamow &quot;that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder of his life&quot;.

The inclusion of this term does not create inconsistencies. For many years the cosmological constant was almost universally assumed to be zero. More recent astronomical observations have shown an accelerating expansion of the universe, and to explain this a positive value of is needed. The effect of the cosmological constant is negligible at the scale of a galaxy or smaller.

Einstein thought of the cosmological constant as an independent parameter, but its term in the field equation can also be moved algebraically to the other side and incorporated as part of the stress–energy tensor:
formula_22

This tensor describes a vacuum state with an energy density and isotropic pressure that are fixed constants and given by
formula_23
where it is assumed that has SI unit m and is defined as above.

The existence of a cosmological constant is thus equivalent to the existence of a vacuum energy and a pressure of opposite sign. This has led to the terms &quot;cosmological constant&quot; and &quot;vacuum energy&quot; being used interchangeably in general relativity.

==Features==

===Conservation of energy and momentum===
General relativity is consistent with the local conservation of energy and momentum expressed as

formula_24

_{\delta\varepsilon;\gamma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The definitions of the Ricci curvature tensor and the scalar curvature then show that
formula_25
which can be rewritten as
formula_26

A final contraction with gives
formula_27
which by the symmetry of the bracketed term and the definition of the Einstein tensor, gives, after relabelling the indices,
formula_28

Using the EFE, this immediately gives,
formula_29

which expresses the local conservation of stress–energy. This conservation law is a physical requirement. With his field equations Einstein ensured that general relativity is consistent with this conservation condition.

===Nonlinearity===

The nonlinearity of the EFE distinguishes general relativity from many other fundamental physical theories. For example, Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism are linear in the electric and magnetic fields, and charge and current distributions (i.e. the sum of two solutions is also a solution); another example is Schrödinger&#x27;s equation of quantum mechanics, which is linear in the wavefunction.

===The correspondence principle===
The EFE reduce to Newton&#x27;s law of gravity by using both the weak-field approximation and the slow-motion approximation. In fact, the constant appearing in the EFE is determined by making these two approximations.

(t) = \vec{g} = - \nabla \Phi \left(\vec{x} (t),t\right) \.&lt;/math&gt;

In tensor notation, these become
formula_30

In general relativity, these equations are replaced by the Einstein field equations in the trace-reversed form
formula_31
for some constant, , and the geodesic equation
formula_32

To see how the latter reduces to the former, we assume that the test particle&#x27;s velocity is approximately zero
formula_33
and thus
formula_34
and that the metric and its derivatives are approximately static and that the squares of deviations from the Minkowski metric are negligible. Applying these simplifying assumptions to the spatial components of the geodesic equation gives
formula_35
where two factors of have been divided out. This will reduce to its Newtonian counterpart, provided
formula_36

Our assumptions force and the time (0) derivatives to be zero. So this simplifies to
formula_37
which is satisfied by letting
formula_38

Turning to the Einstein equations, we only need the time-time component
formula_39
the low speed and static field assumptions imply that
formula_40

So
formula_41
and thus
formula_42

From the definition of the Ricci tensor
formula_43

Our simplifying assumptions make the squares of disappear together with the time derivatives
formula_44

Combining the above equations together
formula_45
which reduces to the Newtonian field equation provided
formula_46
which will occur if
formula_47

==Vacuum field equations==

If the energy–momentum tensor is zero in the region under consideration, then the field equations are also referred to as the vacuum field equations. By setting in the trace-reversed field equations, the vacuum field equations, also known as &#x27;Einstein vacuum equations&#x27; (EVE), can be written as
formula_48

In the case of nonzero cosmological constant, the equations are
formula_49

The solutions to the vacuum field equations are called vacuum solutions. Flat Minkowski space is the simplest example of a vacuum solution. Nontrivial examples include the Schwarzschild solution and the Kerr solution.

Manifolds with a vanishing Ricci tensor, , are referred to as Ricci-flat manifolds and manifolds with a Ricci tensor proportional to the metric as Einstein manifolds.

==Einstein–Maxwell equations==

If the energy–momentum tensor is that of an electromagnetic field in free space, i.e. if the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor
formula_50
is used, then the Einstein field equations are called the &quot;Einstein–Maxwell equations&quot; (with cosmological constant , taken to be zero in conventional relativity theory):
formula_51

Additionally, the covariant Maxwell equations are also applicable in free space:
formula_52
where the semicolon represents a covariant derivative, and the brackets denote anti-symmetrization. The first equation asserts that the 4-divergence of the 2-form is zero, and the second that its exterior derivative is zero. From the latter, it follows by the Poincaré lemma that in a coordinate chart it is possible to introduce an electromagnetic field potential such that
formula_53
in which the comma denotes a partial derivative. This is often taken as equivalent to the covariant Maxwell equation from which it is derived. However, there are global solutions of the equation that may lack a globally defined potential.

==Solutions==
The solutions of the Einstein field equations are metrics of spacetime. These metrics describe the structure of the spacetime including the inertial motion of objects in the spacetime. As the field equations are non-linear, they cannot always be completely solved (i.e. without making approximations). For example, there is no known complete solution for a spacetime with two massive bodies in it (which is a theoretical model of a binary star system, for example). However, approximations are usually made in these cases. These are commonly referred to as post-Newtonian approximations. Even so, there are several cases where the field equations have been solved completely, and those are called exact solutions.

The study of exact solutions of Einstein&#x27;s field equations is one of the activities of cosmology. It leads to the prediction of black holes and to different models of evolution of the universe.

One can also discover new solutions of the Einstein field equations via the method of orthonormal frames as pioneered by Ellis and MacCallum. In this approach, the Einstein field equations are reduced to a set of coupled, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations. As discussed by Hsu and Wainwright, self-similar solutions to the Einstein field equations are fixed points of the resulting dynamical system. New solutions have been discovered using these methods by LeBlanc and Kohli and Haslam.

==The linearized EFE==
The nonlinearity of the EFE makes finding exact solutions difficult. One way of solving the field equations is to make an approximation, namely, that far from the source(s) of gravitating matter, the gravitational field is very weak and the spacetime approximates that of Minkowski space. The metric is then written as the sum of the Minkowski metric and a term representing the deviation of the true metric from the Minkowski metric, ignoring higher-power terms. This linearization procedure can be used to investigate the phenomena of gravitational radiation.

==Polynomial form==
Despite the EFE as written containing the inverse of the metric tensor, they can be arranged in a form that contains the metric tensor in polynomial form and without its inverse. First, the determinant of the metric in 4 dimensions can be written
formula_54
using the Levi-Civita symbol; and the inverse of the metric in 4 dimensions can be written as:
formula_55

Substituting this expression of the inverse of the metric into the equations then multiplying both sides by a suitable power of to eliminate it from the denominator results in polynomial equations in the metric tensor and its first and second derivatives. The Einstein-Hilbert action from which the equations are derived can also be written in polynomial form by suitable redefinitions of the fields.

<text>Advertising in video games is the integration of advertising into video games to promote products, organizations, or viewpoints.

There are two major categories of advertising in video games: in-game advertising and advergames. In-game advertising shows the player advertisements while playing the game, whereas advergames are a type of game created to serve as an advertisement for a brand or product.

Other methods of advertising in video games include in-game product placement and sponsorship of commercial games or other game-related content.

==Categories==
===In-game advertising===
In-game advertising is similar to product placement in films and television, where the advertising content exists within the universe of the characters. These forms of product placement are common, which led to the advertisement technique being applied to video games to match evolving media consumption habits. According to the Entertainment Software Association in 2010, 42% of gamers said they play online games one or more hours per week. Game playing is considered active media consumption, which provides a unique opportunity for advertisers. The principal advantages of product placement in gaming are visibility and notoriety. A single in-game advertisement may be encountered by the player multiple times, and advertisers have an opportunity to ally a brand&#x27;s image with that of a well-received game.

Billboards, storefronts, posters, apparel, vehicles, weapons, fliers, sponsored product placement, and the interplay between the player and these elements in the game allow for a great degree of virtual advertisement. Examples of marketing in video games include brand integration, embedded marketing, recruitment tools, edutainment, and traditional in-game advertising.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in-game advertising is expected to reach $7.2 billion in 2016. Unlike television commercials and digital ads, which can be avoided by using DVRs and ad-blocking software, advertisements embedded within video games cannot be bypassed. A more recent example of in-game advertising is Google&#x27;s placement of video ads between levels of games. These ads are usually branded inline, and TechCrunch reports that they have the potential to gain fast traction in Google&#x27;s AdMob Service.

==== Static in-game advertising ====
Static in-game advertisements are embedded into the video game program. Static ads can be used in the story-line of the game and players can interact with them. The creation of the ads can take from a month or years to reach the public. These ads do not require players to have access to an Internet connection in order to display the campaigns. Limitations include ads becoming outdated or irrelevant as consumer habits change. Because these ads cannot change once released to the public, they also lack the ability to be customized based on player demographics. Examples include billboards advertising for (and product placement of) Bawls energy drink in &quot;&quot;, and billboards for Adidas sportswear in FIFA International Soccer.

==== Dynamic in-game advertising ====
Dynamic in-game advertisements are embedded in online video games that can be changed at any time by the game programmers. Examples of this type of advertisement would be virtual billboards and updates that introduce new items into the game like clothing brands to dress characters or different cars. Dynamics ads are different from static games because companies can provide ads for specific audiences or demographics after the video game has been purchased by the consumer. This way companies can follow the consumer habits and provide ads that can address a certain context. Game developers then can dynamically change the virtual ads spaces embedded into the game to display the ads. Players have a limited interaction with these ads compared to static in-game ads. These ads required active Internet connection for the game company to showcase the ads. Dynamic ads can accommodate time sensitive campaigns and can be shown immediately. These ads can also provide data to show how well campaigns are doing unlike static in-game ads.

=== Advergames ===

Video games that are expressly commissioned to promote a product or service are referred to as &quot;advergames&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;advertising&quot; and &quot;game&quot;. This term was coined in January 2000 by Anthony Giallourakis and later mentioned by &quot;Wired&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Jargon Watch&quot; column in 2001. Advergames have been developed for different platforms including company websites, gaming consoles, and more recently, mobile applications and social media platforms. With the growth of the Internet, advergames have proliferated, often becoming the most visited aspect of brand websites and becoming an integrated part of brand media planning. The advergames sector reached $207 million in 2007.

The earliest custom video games featuring integrated brand messages were developed and distributed on floppy disk. These games were distributed for free, often bundled with other products from the company advertised for. The first floppy disk advergames were developed to serve dual purposes—as promotional incentives that drive response and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods Chef Boyardee issued one of the earliest floppy-disk advergames. Some brands, like Kool-Aid and Pepsi, created early advergames on gaming platforms. They created advergames for the Atari 2600 and gave out promotional copies. The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box advergames are General Mills&#x27;s &quot;Chex Quest&quot; (promoting the Chex brand) and General Mills&#x27;s &quot;All-Star baseball&quot; (starring Trix Rabbit and his friends playing baseball against Major League teams and stars).

Commercial examples include advergames funded by Pepsi, 7 Up, NFL, Formula One, and Burger King. Political and military examples of below-the-line (BTL) advergames include recruitment tools like &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;, intended to boost recruitment for the United States Army, and &quot;Special Force&quot;, intended to promote Muslim resistance to the state of Israel. Educational advergames are related to serious games and can be considered edumarket gaming or edutainment. Examples include &quot;Food Force&quot; (made by the United Nations&#x27;s World Food Program) and &quot;Urban Jungle&quot;, an educational traffic simulation.

===Through-the-line advertising===

Examples of through-the-line (TTL) advertising in games include &quot;link-chases,&quot; ARGs, and viral marketing.

TTL marketing is a form of advertising in video games that involve the use of URL hyperlinks within the game designed to induce the player to visit a web page which then contains BTL advertisements. The technique used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from game to game. In games like &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, the player is given a cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique their curiosity. In games such as &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, &quot;I Love Bees&quot;, and &quot;Lost Experience&quot;, URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but deepen the game story-line for players who follow the links. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label &quot;link-chases&quot;. Although TTL advertising can be an enjoyable experience for players, excessive &quot;link-chasing&quot; can feel obstructive and discourage them from diving deeper into a game&#x27;s story-line. In another form, the URL might be part of a stage where a player can see it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot;, there is a stage where players can see clearly written on an obstacle a URL and the stage&#x27;s name is even the word URL.

== Industry impact ==

=== Prevalence and efficacy ===
In 2019, a survey conducted by deltaDNA found that 94% of free-to-play video game developers incorporate some form of in-game advertising. Among those, the most common type of advertisement were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn in-game prizes. Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos instead of forced advertising.

The reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73% of players being happy with ad-funded games.

The effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by scholars. Brand name recognition in sports game has been shown to be low among college students, although players did retain fragments of the brand names. Another study found that 35% of players could recall advertised brands in car racing games. Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as posters or billboards.

=== Mobile ===
Mobile in-game advertisements are advertisements within mobile games that lead the user to the website or installation page of the advertised product or software upon being clicked. Mobile gaming advertisements can take different forms, including banner ads, pop-up ads, video ads, and interactive ads. Banner ads will display on portions of the screen while the user continues to interact with the mobile game. Pop-up ads will display the advertisement on the entire mobile screen, typically disrupting gameplay; they appear between loading screens or when in-game milestones are completed, only allowing users to close the pop-up ad once a timer runs out. Video ads will display a video advertisement of the advertised products on the entire mobile screen. Interactive ads are a form of pop-up ad that allows the user to interact with the advertisement. For instance, Candy Crush Saga, a free-to-play mobile game, uses playable ads to advertise their game on other mobile applications and provide potential customers with a demo of their game. In 2019, mobile advertising contributed $39.9 billion in revenue to the mobile gaming industry.

=== ESRB ===
The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns ratings based on a detailed questionnaire about the game&#x27;s content and a gameplay clip provided by the publisher. Possible rating categories are &quot;Everyone&quot;, &quot;Everyone 10+&quot;, &quot;Teen&quot;, &quot;Mature 17+&quot;, and &quot;Adults Only 18+&quot;. Ratings are supplemented with content descriptions, such as &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Partial Nudity&quot;, and &quot;Use of Alcohol&quot;. All updates and downloadable content (DLC), including both static and dynamic in-game advertising, are expected to be compliant with the game&#x27;s rating and descriptors, though DLC can be submitted for its own, independent rating if necessary.

If any post-release content is determined to be incompatible with the rating of the base game, publishers are required to update all physical and digital displays of the rating. In the case of physical games, where it is difficult to make these modifications once a game has shipped, sanctions and fines may be levied on the publisher.

The ESRB also includes an Advertising Review Council (ARC) that oversees the marketing of video games in the United States and Canada. Cross-promotion, including when a video game is promoted within another, falls under this umbrella. The ARC ensures that the game being advertised is accurately represented and is not being marketed toward parties below the suitable age range.

==Legislative developments==
=== Academic research ===
The University of Bath&#x27;s Institute for Policy Research researched the use of advergames in marketing to children in the United Kingdom. The report, published in June 2014, suggested that children as old as 15 did not recognize that advergames were adverts and had their food choices influenced without their conscious awareness. Based on these findings, the University called for &quot;urgent government action to protect children from the subconscious effects of advergames.&quot;

=== United States legislation ===

==== Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ====
The Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect the personal data collected from children online. Operators of websites or online services are barred from handling the personal information of children under the age of 13 without verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. Restrictions apply to any website or online service that is targeted toward children or has knowledge that it is collecting data from children.

==== Do Not Track Kids Acts ====
Representatives Edward Markey [D-MA] and Joe Barton [R-TX] proposed the Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011 as an amendment to COPPA. The bill would have extended COPPA to prohibit companies from distributing personal and geolocation information knowingly collected from minors for use in targeted advertising. It also expands the restrictions enumerated in the act to both online and mobile applications, which had previously been omitted.

Regarding his motivation for co-sponsoring the Act, Representative Barton reflected, &quot;We have reached a troubling point in the state of the business when companies that conduct business online are so eager to make a buck, they resort to targeting our children.&quot;

Since the death of the 2011 bill, Markey and Barton have continued to spawn similar Do Not Track Kids legislation in both chambers of Congress. These bills were proposed in 2013, 2015, and 2018, though none of them passed through the committee stage.

==== Targeted advergame marketing ====
A bill was recently introduced in the Senate that proposes restrictions on the use of information obtained through advergames to market to children. Some games ask users to provide personal information, such as name, gender, and age, then display targeted advertisements based on these characteristics. This bill would prevent companies from using this information to change the game to target certain age brackets.

==Examples==

=== Food and beverages ===

*Mattel&#x27;s M Network division released the &quot;promogame&quot; &quot;Kool-Aid Man&quot; for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision in 1983. The game was originally available only via mail order by sending in UPC symbols from Kool-Aid containers, but later became available for retail purchase.
*Purina had a mail-in offer for the Atari 2600 game &quot;Chase the Chuck Wagon&quot; for customers of Chuck Wagon dog food in 1983.
*Johnson &amp; Johnson released an Atari 2600 game called &quot;Tooth Protectors&quot; in 1983, also by mail-order.

The latter two ran Phelps, James &amp; Co., the part of the organization based in Liverpool, England. The import-export firm at first exported United States cotton from the Deep South to England and imported various metals to the US needed for industrialization. With the expansion of the Western frontier in North America, the corporation acquired mines and mining companies, including the Copper Queen Mine in Cochise County, Arizona and the Dawson, New Mexico coal mines. It operated its own mines and acquired railroads to carry its products. By the late 19th century, it was known as a mining company.

On March 19, 2007, Freeport-McMoRan completed a $25.9 billion acquisition of Phelps Dodge Corporation.

==History==
in 1821, Anson G. Phelps started a partnership in New York City with Elisha Peck, a merchant who had been in trade in Berlin, Connecticut. Peck moved to Liverpool to run the British end of their business, an import-export company that shipped US-grown cotton from the Deep South to England, importing tin, iron, copper and other metals essential for industrial growth and development in the United States. In 1834, Peck left the business and was replaced in Liverpool by Daniel James, who remained there until his death in 1876. It was at this time that the concern of Phelps Dodge and Company was begun.

==Expansion==

When Anson G. Phelps died, his sons-in-law purchased his portion of the company, but retained the name, and the import-export business. In 1880, the company invested in the Detroit Copper Company of Clifton, Arizona, at the time a very small copper camp in the eastern Arizona Territory. Phelps-Dodge interested Dr. James Douglas of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania to inspect the property and make recommendations. Dr. Douglas inspected the Detroit Copper Co of Morenci and also ventured south to the Warren District. On his advice, Phelps-Dodge began its own mining operations in the Warren District with the purchase of the Atlanta Copper Mine in 1882, neighboring the Copper Queen Mine. When both mines discovered the same ore body, instead of fighting over it, they merged in 1885, creating the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company. The Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee, Arizona Territory, became one of the most productive in the state of the early 20th century.

The company focused largely on providing copper wire and cables to industry, products that were in high demand as the Industrial Revolution took hold. As the company diversified, it began investing in new railroads, essential in the company&#x27;s efforts to keep costs as low as possible, especially in Arizona Territory. It used its own lines to transport products to and from major railroads for its markets on the eastern/northeastern shores.

In 1895, the first contract was signed by Phelps Dodge and Company and the Nichols Copper Company (which was renamed from G. H. Nichols and Company in 1891) to have Phelps Dodge deliver a minimum of of blister copper over three years. This economically symbiotic relationship lasted until 1922, in which Phelps Dodge provided 90% of the blister copper Nichols Copper Company used to produce 100% pure copper. During the 1920s, Phelps Dodge invested $3.5 million in the Nichols Copper Company&#x27;s plant modernization projects in exchange for stock in Nichols Copper Company. This dramatically increased copper production of the plant. In 1930, Dr. William Henry Nichols died; Phelps Dodge purchased the Laurel Hill plant that same year.

During the late 19th century, in concert with its metal interests, Phelps Dodge Corporation became one of the largest producers of lumber and lumber products in the United States.

In Tombstone, Arizona during 1900 E. B. Gage, Frank Murphy, and William Staunton consolidated their various mining properties into a single entity, the Tombstone Consolidated Mines Company. They worked to drain mines that had filled with water, laid a rail spur into town, and revived mining. They experienced some success until the pumps failed in 1909. The new company filed for bankruptcy and the Phelps-Dodge Corporation acquired its claims. 
In 1908, with the Phelps Dodge owners no longer alive, the company was re-organized as a public company and the name changed to Phelps Dodge Corporation, a holding company for all of the various properties and operations. Dr. Douglas was its first president.

==Labor relations==

The company became notorious for its anti-union tactics, primarily for the 1917 Bisbee Deportation. The company worked with a local group of private citizens and the county sheriff to deputize about 2,000 members of a posse. Given names of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) members and other miners, they arrested nearly 1,300 striking miners at gunpoint in an early morning raid at Bisbee, Lowell and Warren. Portraying those affiliated with the IWW as bent on war-related sabotage, the company ordered them expelled from the jurisdiction, deporting them to Hermanas, New Mexico. Company officials and Sheriff Harry C. Wheeler seized telegraph and telephone lines to keep news of this from getting out.

The Phelps Dodge copper mine at Morenci, Arizona was the site of a violent strike from 1983 to 1986, culminating in one of the largest union decertifications in American labor history.

==Subdivisions==

In South America, the company had several very large copper mining operations in Peru. In the Congo of Africa, Phelps Dodge Corporation was the majority owner and operator of the Tenke Fungurume project, generally considered to be the world&#x27;s largest undeveloped copper/cobalt project.

A subsidiary of Phelps Dodge Corporation, Climax Molybdenum, is the largest primary producer of molybdenum in the world. At the Henderson mine west of Empire, Colorado, Climax Molybdenum has produced more than 160 million tons of ore and 770 million pounds of molybdenum since the mine opened in 1976. Climax Molybdenum also owns the Climax molybdenum mine, north of Leadville, Colorado.

In 1906, Phelps-Dodge acquired the Dawson Fuel Company of Dawson, New Mexico to mine coal for its copper smelting operations. Major accidents include the explosion at the Dawson Stag Canyon No. 2 mine which resulted in 264 deaths, and is one of the deadliest coal mining accidents in U.S. history.

The company employed more than 13,500 people worldwide.

==Expansion and acquisition==
On Sunday, November 19, 2006, Freeport-McMoRan announced that it planned to acquire Phelps Dodge for $25.9 billion in cash and stock to create the world&#x27;s largest publicly traded copper mining company. Stockholders for both companies voted on the proposal March 14, 2007. On Monday, March 19, 2007, Phelps Dodge Corporation was acquired by Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), creating the world&#x27;s largest publicly traded copper company, with 25,000 employees at acquisition.

At the time of its acquisition in 2007, Phelps Dodge Corporation had large copper mining operations in Bagdad, Morenci, Sahuarita, Safford and Miami, Arizona. In New Mexico, the Tyrone, between Lordsburg and Silver City and the El Chino Mine, northeast of Bayard. Several of these locations provide ores rich in molybdenum as well. It had recently begun development of the Safford Mine near Safford, Arizona. In 2006, revenue was $11.910 billion USD, operating income was $4.226 billion, and net income was $3.017 billion.

==Environmental record==

As of 2013, the Political Economy Research Institute identified Phelps Dodge as the 41st-largest corporate producer of Air pollution in the United States, with roughly 4.50 million pounds of toxins released annually into the air. Major pollutants included sulfuric acid, chromium compounds, lead compounds, and chlorine. The Center for Public Integrity has reported that Phelps Dodge is named as a potentially responsible party in at least 13 Superfund toxic waste sites.

== Worker death ==
By June 1998, Reynaldo Delgado had worked for the Phelps Dodge smelting plant in Hurley, New Mexico, for two years. The plant had recently incurred a 10-day shut-down, and, on June 30, 1998, the crew Mr. Delgado was assigned to was short-handed. When the crew encountered an emergency situation known as a &quot;runaway,&quot; Mr. Delgado&#x27;s supervisors ordered him to enter – alone – a tunnel to remove a ladle that was overflowing with molten slag. Mr. Delgado was not qualified to perform this task and had never done so under runaway conditions, facts which he repeatedly told his supervisors. Following several instances of protesting and requesting help, which were refused by his supervisors, Mr. Delgado was sent to perform this task. There was an explosion inside the tunnel, and he subsequently emerged from the tunnel fully engulfed in flames and collapsed at the scene. He suffered third degree burns over his entire body and later died at an Arizona hospital.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; takes place in the fictional country of . In this world, alchemy is one of the most-practiced sciences; alchemists who work for the government are known as and are automatically given the rank of major in the military. Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called transmutation circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body, and the result is an inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by , a pantheistic and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use, and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person with whom Truth converses; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant.

Attemptees of human transmutation are also thrown into the , where they receive an overwhelming dose of information, but also allowing them to transmute without a circle. All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the Gaea hypothesis, heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange using a Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher&#x27;s Stones are used to create Homunculi, artificial humans of proud nature who are named after and embody the seven deadly sins; Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other, and look down upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher&#x27;s Stones.

There are several cities throughout Amestris. The main setting is the capital of , along with other military cities such as the northern city of . Towns featured include , the rural hometown of the Elrics; , a city tricked into following a cult; , a town that specializes in automail manufacturing; and Ishbal, a conservative-religion region that rejects alchemy and was destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child. Outside of Amestris, there are few named countries, and none are seen in the main story. The main foreign country is Xing. Heavily reminiscent of China, Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors, as opposed to Amestris&#x27;s government-controlled election of a Führer. It also has its own system of alchemy, called , which is more medical and can be bi-located using kunai; in turn, it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemy.

=== Plot ===
Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim. For unknown reasons, Hohenheim abandons them, and Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. However, the transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely deconstructed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse&#x27;s soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist and research a way to restore their bodies, undergoing a painful medical procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone to achieve their goals.

The Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan serial killer known as Scar, who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his people&#x27;s genocide in the Ishbalan civil war. Returning to Resembool to have Edward&#x27;s limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic, Winry Rockbell, the Elrics meet Dr. Marcoh, who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosopher&#x27;s Stone is created from human souls. They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created, but are hindered by the Homunculi. The Elrics decide to visit Izumi, hoping to improve their alchemy. Mustang&#x27;s friend Maes Hughes continues the Elrics&#x27; research and finds out about a government conspiracy, but is killed by the homunculus Envy. The Elrics learn that Izumi also performed human transmutation, having attempted to use alchemy to revive her stillborn child. Alphonse is captured by the homunculus Greed, but is rescued by Amestris&#x27; leader King Bradley. Bradley is revealed to be the homunculus Wrath and brings the captured Greed to the Homunculi&#x27;s creator, Father. When Greed refuses to rejoin his fellow Homunculi, he is reabsorbed by Father. 

After meeting the Xingese prince Lin Yao, who seeks a Philosopher&#x27;s Stone to cement his position as heir to his country&#x27;s throne, the Elrics return to Central City, where they learn of Hughes&#x27;s murder. Lieutenant Maria Ross is framed for Hughes&#x27; murder, so Mustang fakes Ross&#x27;s death and smuggles her out of the country. In encounters with the Homunculi, Mustang kills Lust. Lin captures Gluttony, who swallows Lin, Edward, and Envy into his void-like stomach. They escape from Gluttony&#x27;s stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father, who makes Lin the vessel of Greed. Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Father&#x27;s plans. The Elrics and Mustang are released, but warned not to oppose Father, who seeks to use them as &quot;human sacrifices&quot;. Meanwhile, Scar heads north with the Xingese princess May Chang, former corrupt official Yoki, and a kidnapped Dr. Marcoh.

The Elrics head north as well, and reach Fort Briggs, commanded by General Olivier Armstrong. They confront the homunculus Sloth and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. With it, he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the &quot;Promised Day&quot;. Forced to work with Solf Kimblee, a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi, the Elrics turn on him and split up, joined by a reformed Scar, his group, Kimblee&#x27;s chimera subordinates, and later Lin/Greed. Riza Hawkeye discovers that King Bradley&#x27;s son Selim is the homunculus Pride. Hohenheim reveals that he was made an immortal when Father arranged the fall of four centuries ago and had been working since then to stop Father.

The Promised Day arrives, with Father planning to use an eclipse and &#x27;human sacrifices&#x27;— alchemists who have performed human transmutation — to trigger his own transmutation. Wrath and Pride force Mustang to perform the human transmutation, blinding him. The Elrics and their comrades battle Father&#x27;s minions, resulting in Pride being reduced to an infant, Greed sacrificing himself to save Lin, and the other homunculi as well as Kimblee dying. However, Father manages to activate the nationwide transmutation circle and absorbs the superior being.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
After reading about the concept of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, Arakawa became attracted to the idea of her characters using alchemy in the manga. She started reading books about alchemy, which she found complicated because some books contradict others. Arakawa was attracted more by the philosophical aspects than the practical ones. For the concept, she was inspired by the work of her parents, who had a farm in Hokkaido and worked hard to earn the money to eat.

Arakawa wanted to integrate social problems into the story. Her research involved watching television news programs and talking to refugees, war veterans and former yakuza. Several plot elements, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies, and the brothers helping people to understand the meaning of family, expand on these themes. When creating the fictional world of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, Arakawa was inspired after reading about the Industrial Revolution in Europe; she was amazed by differences in the culture, architecture, and clothes of the era and those of her own culture. She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga. The series has a steampunk setting. The Ishbal region has similarities to the Middle East, with the plot anticipating elements of the Iraq War which later occurred in the real world.

When the manga began serialization, Arakawa was considering several major plot points, including the ending. She wanted the Elric brothers to recover their bodiesat least partly. As the plot continued, she thought that some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes. Arakawa said the manga authors Suihō Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs; she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them. She found that the easiest of the series&#x27;s characters to draw were Alex Louis Armstrong, and the little animals. Arakawa likes dogs so she included several of them in the story. Arakawa made comedy central to the manga&#x27;s story because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimize sad scenes.

=== Conclusion ===
When around forty manga chapters had been published, Arakawa said that as the series was nearing its end and she would try to increase the pace of the narrative. To avoid making some chapters less entertaining than others, unnecessary details from each of them were removed and a climax was developed. The removal of minor details was also necessary because Arakawa had too few pages in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot; to include all the story content she wanted to add. Some characters&#x27; appearances were limited in some chapters. At first, Arakawa thought the series would last 21 volumes but the length increased to 27. Serialization finished after nine years, and Arakawa was satisfied with her work because she had told everything she wanted with the manga.

During the development of the first anime, Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her and requested a different ending from that of the manga. She said that she would not like to repeat the same ending in both media, and wanted to make the manga longer so she could develop the characters. When watching the ending of the anime, she was amazed about how different the homunculi creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains. Because Arakawa helped the Bones staff in the making of the series, she was kept from focusing on the manga&#x27;s cover illustrations and had little time to make them.

=== Themes and analysis ===
The series explores social problems, including discrimination, scientific advancement, political greed, brotherhood, family, and war. Scar&#x27;s backstory and his hatred of the state military references the Ainu people, who had their land taken by other people. This includes the consequences of guerrilla warfare and the number of violent soldiers a military can have. Some of the people who took the Ainus&#x27; land were originally Ainu; this irony is referenced in Scar&#x27;s use of alchemy to kill alchemists even though it was forbidden in his own religion. The Elrics being orphans and adopted by Pinako Rockbell reflects Arakawa&#x27;s beliefs about the ways society should treat orphans. The characters&#x27; dedication to their occupations reference the need to work for food. The series also explores the concept of equivalent exchange; to obtain something new, one must pay with something of equal value. This is applied by alchemists when creating new materials and is also a philosophical belief the Elric brothers follow.

<doc id="424550" wikidata="Q3510577" url="?curid=424550" title="2001 Nisqually earthquake">
<text>The 2001 Nisqually earthquake occurred at on February 28, 2001, and lasted nearly a minute. The intraslab earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;). The epicenter was in the southern Puget Sound, northeast of Olympia, but the shock was felt in Oregon, British Columbia, eastern Washington, and Idaho. This was the most recent of several large earthquakes that occurred in the Puget Sound region over a 52-year period and caused property damage valued at $1–4 billion. One person died of a heart attack and several hundred were injured.

==Tectonic setting==
The Puget Sound area is prone to deep earthquakes due to the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate&#x27;s subduction under the North American plate at 3.5 to 4.5 cm a year as part of the Cascadia subduction zone. Three types of earthquake are observed in the area: rare megathrust events, such as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, shallow events within the North American plate and deeper intraslab events within the Juan de Fuca plate as it sinks into the mantle. The third type of earthquake is the one that has led to the greatest amount of damage. Significant intraslab earthquakes occurred in the same general region on April 29, 1965 (magnitude 6.7, depth ), and April 13, 1949 (magnitude 6.7, depth ).

==Earthquake==
The earthquake was an intraslab event within the Juan de Fuca plate. It was a result of normal faulting within the descending slab, but it has not been possible to determine which of the two possible fault planes indicated by the focal mechanism is correct.

===Damage===
Although there were no directly related deaths, local news outlets reported that there was one death from a heart attack. About 400 people were injured. Most of the property damage occurred very near the epicenter or in unreinforced concrete or masonry buildings, such as those in the First Hill, Pioneer Square, and SoDo neighborhoods of Seattle. The Trinity Parish Church on First Hill was severely damaged. The air traffic control tower at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport was heavily damaged; it has since been replaced with a more earthquake-resistant tower. The quake splintered a buttress under the dome of the capitol building in Olympia, but previous earthquake-resistance work prevented more serious harm to the building. Additionally, power outages affected downtown Seattle. The U.S. Military&#x27;s Ft. Lewis and McChord Air Force Base received damage and there was very slight damage in Victoria, British Columbia.


Following the quake, many buildings and structures in the area were closed temporarily for inspection. This included several bridges, all state offices in Olympia, and Boeing&#x27;s factories in the Seattle area. Various schools in the state also closed for the day. The Fourth Avenue Bridge in downtown Olympia was heavily damaged and was later torn down and re-built. In Seattle, the Alaskan Way Viaduct and its seawall were damaged, forcing the viaduct to close for emergency repairs and ultimately factoring into the decision to replace the viaduct with the SR 99 Tunnel and an expanded Alaskan Way on the footprint of the old viaduct. The new tunnel is designed to withstand a 9.0 MW earthquake.

Approximately $305 million of insured losses and a total of $2 billion worth of damage was caused in the state of Washington. The area was declared a natural disaster area by president George W. Bush and was therefore able to receive federal recovery assistance. The number of businesses in the heavily affected region was relatively small. At least 20% of businesses surrounding the heavily affected area took direct losses, while 2% had direct losses of over $10,000. None of these businesses received money for direct damage from federal aid or insurance.

Many businesses did not receive any aid at all. Those that did receive aid had no help with indirect losses. Indirect losses varied from inventory or data corruption, disruption in the workplace, productivity, etc. Data and inventory losses were possibly the most damaging, especially for retail stores. Retail stores lost inventory as well as people&#x27;s interest for a period of time after the quake. One of the vital elements to prevent damage and injury were well structured buildings. This can prevent the loss of life as well as inventory. Businesses that did not sustain very much damage also gained a sense of security that may be unreliable as the moment magnitude was high but the hypocenter was deep under the earth. This earthquake was a 6.8 moment magnitude that caused $2 billion damage while the Northridge earthquake was a 6.7 moment magnitude, but caused more than $20 billion worth of damage as the hypocenter of the Northridge earthquake was much shallower and closer to the surface of the earth.

===Ground effects===
Named after the Nisqually Delta, this earthquake hit the southern end of Puget Sound causing damage to the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. In the month following the earthquake, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the USGS assembled a team to map the bathymetry of the deltas near the epicenter. This revealed multiple submarine failures on the Puyallup and Duwamish delta fronts. In other areas liquefaction, sand boils, landslides, and soil slumping occurred. Liquefaction was also determined to be a main contributor to increased stream flows. With multiple stream gauges collecting data before and after the earthquake there was a regular pattern of higher increased stream flow around areas where liquefaction occurred. Soil liquefaction was also observed at the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge causing damage to the buildings within.

==Response==
A rapid response plan was developed a year later. The region realized how it had avoided a potentially extremely damaging catastrophe. Many businesses, organizations, and hospitals were asked to sign a regional disaster plan, allowing disaster relief teams to locate and aid places much faster than before. The regional plan would also facilitate directing limited resources to places with greatest immediate need.

<doc id="424552" wikidata="Q6210357" url="?curid=424552" title="Joe Hoeffel">
<text>Joseph Merrill Hoeffel III ( ; born September 3, 1950) is an American author and politician. A Democrat, Hoeffel was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1999 to 2005, representing Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th congressional district. He also served multiple terms on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, and from 1977–84, was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. A native of Philadelphia, he is a graduate of Boston University and Temple University School of Law.

Hoeffel was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in 2004, and for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2010.

== Background ==
Hoeffel was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Joseph and Eleanore Hoeffel. After graduating from William Penn Charter School in 1968, he attended Boston University and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1972. He served in the Army Reserves from 1970 to 1976.

He first became involved in politics during the 1972 presidential election, when his opposition to the Vietnam War led him to support Senator George McGovern. In 1973, he became a legislative aide to Representative Gerry Studds of Massachusetts, for whom Hoeffel did research on foreign overfishing.

==Political career==

After working for Studds for a year, Hoeffel challenged four-term Republican incumbent Daniel Beren for a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the Abington-based 153rd district, in 1974. He was defeated by 1,505 votes. From 1975 to 1976, he was the Central Montgomery County administrator for the American Red Cross.

Hoeffel successfully ran again for state House in 1976, after Beren decided to not seek re-election. He was the first Democrat to represent the Abington area since World War I. He served from 1977 to 1985. The first bill he passed as a state legislator was a campaign reform proposal in 1978 improving financial disclosure.

In 1984, he gave up his seat to run for the United States House of Representatives in the 13th congressional district, but was defeated by longtime Republican incumbent Lawrence Coughlin. Hoeffel sought a rematch in 1986, and was defeated again. He received his Juris Doctor degree from Temple University School of Law in 1986, and then worked at the Norristown law firms of Wright, Manning, Kinkaid &amp; Oliver (1987–90) and Kane, Pugh &amp; Driscoll (1990–91).

After several years out of politics, Hoeffel won a seat on the Montgomery County Commission in 1991. In a surprise to the political establishment, Hoeffel supported Republican Mario Mele for Commission chairman over Jon Fox.

In 1996, Hoeffel made a third run at Congress, taking on his former colleague on the Montgomery County Commission, Jon Fox, now a first-term Congressman. That year, Fox hung onto his seat by an 84-vote margin. However, in 1998, in his fourth attempt, Hoeffel broke through. Hobbled by a tough Republican primary and the fallout from the impeachment process against President Bill Clinton, Fox could not hang on a second time. Hoeffel won by more than 5,000 votes. Hoeffel became only the second Democrat to represent the Montgomery County-based district in 86 years.

He won re-election twice, though not without difficulty. In 2000 he won an expensive race against Republican State Senator Stewart Greenleaf, who represented most of the eastern portion of the congressional district. He thus became the first Democrat to serve more than one term in the district in decades. In 2002, he defeated wealthy ophthalmologist Melissa Brown by less than expected; the 13th had been made somewhat more Democratic with the addition of part of Philadelphia. During the 2002 election, Hoeffel&#x27;s website was praised as among the best of the 2002 election cycle.

In Congress, Hoeffel was a member of two House committees: International Relations and Transportation and Infrastructure.

On July 20, 2004, Hoeffel became the third sitting U.S. Congressman in one week, following Charles Rangel and Bobby Rush, to be arrested for trespassing while protesting alleged human rights violations in front of the Sudanese Embassy. U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, Hoeffel&#x27;s Republican opponent in the 2004 U.S. Senate race, criticized the arrest as a publicity stunt.

Rather than holding onto his seat, Hoeffel decided in 2004 to run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Arlen Specter. In the election held on November 2, 2004, Hoeffel was defeated by more than ten points to Specter, 53%-42%, and only carried four counties. Hoeffel was at a considerable disadvantage because of Specter&#x27;s popularity in the Philadelphia suburbs.

===After Congress===
Hoeffel endorsed Bob Casey, Jr. for the United States Senate in 2006; Casey defeated incumbent Republican Rick Santorum by a wide margin.

Hoeffel announced that he would run for lieutenant governor in March 2006 against incumbent Catherine Baker Knoll, but dropped out of the race a day later. Governor Ed Rendell convinced Hoeffel that the Democratic ticket needed geographic balance; Knoll is from Allegheny County; Rendell is from Philadelphia. The Democratic Committees of Bucks and Chester Counties had overwhelmingly voted to endorse him over Knoll.

In February 2007, Hoeffel announced that he would resign his post in order to run for the Montgomery County Commission with incumbent Ruth Damsker. Hoeffel&#x27;s and Damsker&#x27;s opponents were incumbent Jim Matthews and district attorney Bruce Castor.

Hopes were high that the Democrats could win majority control on the commission due to party gains in the county and a fractured county Republican party. Hoeffel finished second, behind Castor, winning a seat on the Commission, but his running mate fell short, keeping control in Republican hands. However, thanks to a deal with Matthews, Hoeffel became Vice Chairman of the Commission, in exchange for supporting Matthews&#x27; bid to become Chairman over Castor.

====2010 gubernatorial campaign====

On September 20, 2009, Hoeffel announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of Pennsylvania. During the campaign, he called for the introduction of a graduated income tax for the state, supported the implementation of a statewide single-payer health care program, stressed his pro-choice position on abortion and opposition to school vouchers, and distinguished himself as the only candidate supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage.

He received endorsements from NOW, the Stonewall Democrats, the United Auto Workers, and various local affiliates of Democracy for America.

In the May 18, 2010 primary, he placed fourth out of four candidates, receiving 130,799 votes, or 12.7% of the total votes cast, and winning Montgomery County, though without a majority.



====Subsequent political career====
Within days of losing the 2010 primary for governor, Hoeffel announced he would seek another term as county commissioner in 2011. He followed Matthews, who also initially announced his intention to seek re-election.

A subsequent grand jury report found questionable behavior on Hoeffel&#x27;s part for his participation in discussing county business at private breakfast meetings held with Matthews and senior aides–an alleged violation of state Sunshine laws. However, unlike Matthews, who was later alleged to have perjured himself while testifying to the grand jury, Hoeffel was never charged with criminal wrongdoing.

On March 10, 2018, Hoeffel announced that he would seek to retake his old congressional seat, now renumbered as the 4th District. A court-ordered remap had cut out the district&#x27;s share of Philadelphia. Although the new 4th was geographically similar to the area he had represented for his first two terms, he finished a distant third, with only 11 percent of the vote, well behind State Representative and fellow Abingdon resident Madeleine Dean.

==Political positions==

===Education===
According to his campaign website, Hoeffel favors expanded funding for early childhood education programs, drop-out prevention and drop-out reengagement programs and centers, and basic education for school board members. He favors keeping the current defined benefit pension plan for all teachers over a change to a defined contribution plan for new hires. Hoeffel would continue the school funding formula implemented by Governor Ed Rendell to reduce dependence on local property taxes to fund schools.

===Labor===
Hoeffel has a lifetime 97% rating from the AFL–CIO and is endorsed by several labor unions in the Philadelphia area.

===Abortion===
Hoeffel has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. He is endorsed by former NARAL Pro-Choice America President Kate Michelman, and by the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Organization for Women

===LGBT rights===
He favors amending Pennsylvania&#x27;s Hate Crimes Law to include crimes targeting LGBT people and supports full marriage rights.

== Writing ==
Hoeffel&#x27;s book about his vote for the Iraq War, &quot;The Iraq Lie: How the White House Sold the War&quot;, was published in 2014 by Progressive Press. Hoeffel provides a first-person account of the Congressional debate on the Iraq War Resolution, and argues that the Bush White House misled Congress and the country and took the United States to war in Iraq under false pretenses. Hoeffel suggests intelligence reforms to prevent such deceptions from happening again.

Hoeffel&#x27;s second book, &quot;Fighting for the Progressive Center in the Age of Trump&quot;, was published in August 2017 by Praeger. In this book, Hoeffel argues that &quot;progressives must fight for the political center of our civic arena with policies that are both socially liberal and fiscally responsible if we want to win the battle for public support against Donald Trump.&quot; The book is a mix of policy prescriptions which reject partisan extremes and rigid ideologies, with numerous anecdotes from 25 years serving in elected office at the county, state and federal levels.

==Personal life==
He is married to Francesca Hoeffel. They live in Abington Township, a suburb of Philadelphia, and have two children. His grandfather, also named Joseph M. &quot;Joe&quot; Hoeffel, served as coach of the Green Bay Packers in 1921.

<doc id="424556" wikidata="Q7791351" url="?curid=424556" title="Thomas Johnson (designer)">
<text>Thomas Johnson (1714–1778) was an English wood carver and furniture maker.

== Work ==

Johnson worked in London and is particularly known for bold or extreme use and mixture of rococo, Chinese, and rustic motifs. He was said to be one of the most successful exponents of the rococo style, giving it a vitality not seen in the work of other designers. Among other works, he adapted scenes from Francis Barlow&#x27;s illustrations of Aesop&#x27;s Fables.

Of excellent repute as a craftsman and an artist in wood, Johnson&#x27;s original conceptions and his adaptations of other&#x27;s ideas were remarkable for their extreme flamboyance, and for the merciless manner in which he overloaded them with thin and meretricious ornament. He participated in the Antigallican Association, an informal group opposed to French fashion and influence. Some of his designs, however, were taken from French works. Many of his pieces were also more fanciful expression of Thomas Chippendale&#x27;s design ideas. 

The three leading &quot;motives&quot; of the time—Chinese, Gothic and Louis Quatorze—were mixed up in his work in the most amazing manner; and he was exceedingly fond of introducing human figures, animals, birds and fishes in highly incongruous places. He appears to have defended his enormities on the ground that &quot;all men vary in opinion, and a fault in the eye of one may be a beauty in that of another; &#x27;tis a duty incumbent on an author to endeavour at pleasing every taste.&quot;

== Books ==

In the 1750s he published several books of designs which were widely used for things like ceiling moulding. These books include &quot;Twelve Girandoles&quot; in 1755, &quot;The Book of the Carver&quot; in 1758, a folio volume of &quot;Designs for Picture Frames&quot;, &quot;Candelabra&quot;, &quot;Ceilings&quot;, &quot;&amp;c&quot;. also in 1758 and monthly between 1755 and 1758, &quot;One hundred and fifty New Designs&quot;. He also had a great influence on Ince and Mayhew&#x27;s book, &quot;The Universal System of Household Furniture&quot;.

<text>Oberallgäu is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Unterallgäu and Ostallgäu, the Austrian states Tyrol and Vorarlberg, the district of Lindau, and the state of Baden-Württemberg (district Ravensburg). The city of Kempten is enclosed by but does not belong to the district.

==History==
Human settlement dates back to the Bronze Age, when Celtic peoples inhabited the region. The Romans established a military camp which grew to become the city of Cambodunum, the present Kempten. It is consequently sometimes claimed that Kempten is the oldest town in Germany.

In medieval times Kempten was a free imperial city, and the surrounding lands became subordinate to the lords of Staufen and the counts of Rothenfels. Both ceased to exist in the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon handed these territories over to Bavaria.

The district of Oberallgäu was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Sonthofen and Kempten.

==Geography==
Oberallgäu is the southernmost district of Germany. &quot;Oberallgäu&quot; literally means &quot;Upper Allgäu&quot;. The term Allgäu is applied to the part of the Alps located in Swabia and their northern foothills.

In the very south of the district are some of the highest mountains of the Allgäu, culminating in the Hochfrottspitze (2,649 m). Blender, which rises to 1,072 m, is located between the municipalities of Buchenberg and Wiggensbach. The Iller River (a tributary of the Danube) runs through the district from south to north.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays a mountain symbolising the Allgäu, and three lions from the arms of the Staufen dynasty.

<doc id="424562" wikidata="Q1162708" url="?curid=424562" title="Praxeology">
<text>In philosophy, praxeology or praxiology (; ) is the theory of human action, based on the notion that humans engage in purposeful behavior, contrary to reflexive behavior and other unintentional behavior.

French social philosopher Alfred Espinas gave the term its modern meaning, and praxeology was developed independently by two principal groups: the Austrian school, led by Ludwig von Mises, and the Polish school, led by Tadeusz Kotarbiński.

==Origin and etymology==

Coinage of the word &quot;praxeology&quot; (&quot;praxéologie&quot;) is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his &quot;Théorie des sciences. Plan de science intégrale&quot; in 1882:

However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by Clemens Timpler in his &quot;Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum&quot;:

It was later mentioned by Robert Flint in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau&#x27;s &quot;Théorie des sciences&quot;.

The modern definition of the word was first given by Alfred V. Espinas (1844–1922), the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of efficient action. The Austrian school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.

With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist Charles Arthur Mercier (in 1911), and proposed by Knight Dunlap to John B. Watson as a better name for his behaviorism, but Watson rejected it. The Chinese physiologist of behavior Zing-Yang Kuo (b. 1898) adopted the term around 1935. It was also used by William McDougall (in 1928 and later).

Previously the word &quot;praxiology&quot;, with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by Tadeusz Kotarbiński (in 1923). The Ukrainian economist Eugene Slutsky (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist Nikolai Bukharin (1888–1938) during the Second International Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar Oscar Lange (1904–1965) in 1959, and later.

The Sicilian philosopher Carmelo Ottaviano was using the Italianised version, &quot;prassiologia&quot;, in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the Second World War the use of the term &quot;praxeology&quot; spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to the US his pupil Murray Rothbard defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas&#x27;s approach in France was revealed in the works of Pierre Massé (1946), the cybernetician, Georges Théodule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, Leo Apostel (1957), the cybernetician, Anatol Rapoport (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), François Perroux, economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, Raymond Aron (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).

Under the influence of Tadeusz Kotarbiński, praxeology flourished in Poland. A special &quot;Centre of Praxeology&quot; (&quot;Zaklad Prakseologiczny&quot;) was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first &quot;Materiały Prakseologiczne&quot; (&quot;Praxeological Papers&quot;), and then abbreviated to &quot;Prakseologia&quot;. It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French statistician Micheline Petruszewycz, &quot;A propos de la praxéologie&quot;.

Ludwig von Mises was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including Immanuel Kant&#x27;s works, Max Weber&#x27;s work on methodological individualism, and Carl Menger&#x27;s development of the subjective theory of value.

Philosopher of science Mario Bunge published works of systematic philosophy that included contributions to praxeology.

==Austrian economics==

Austrian economics in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories. Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology. Austrian School economists, following Mises, use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to these theorists, with the action axiom as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.

Advocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.

===Subdivisions===
In 1951, Murray Rothbard divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:
: A. The Theory of the Isolated Individual (Crusoe Economics)
: B. The Theory of Voluntary Interpersonal Exchange (Catallactics, or the Economics of the Market)
:: 1. Barter
:: 2. With Medium of Exchange
::: a. On the Unhampered Market
::: b. Effects of Violent Intervention with the Market
::: c. Effects of Violent Abolition of the Market (Socialism)
: C. The Theory of War – Hostile Action
: D. The Theory of Games (Game theory) (e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern)
: E. Unknown
At the time, topics C, D, and E were regarded by Rothbard as open research problems.

===Criticisms===
Thomas Mayer has argued that, because praxeology rejects positivism and empiricism in the development of theories, it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the scientific method. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the Austrian school of economics. Austrians argue that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions. Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and non-repeatable, whereas experiments in the physical sciences are necessarily reproducible.

However, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.

Argentine-Canadian philosopher Mario Bunge dismissed von Mises&#x27;s version of praxeology as &quot;nothing but the principle of maximization of subjective utility—a fancy version of egoism&quot;. Bunge, who was also a fierce critic of pseudoscience, warned that when &quot;conceived in extremely general terms and detached from both ethics and science, praxiology has hardly any practical value&quot;.

<doc id="424564" wikidata="Q163950" url="?curid=424564" title="Vol. 4 (Black Sabbath album)">
<text>Vol. 4 is the fourth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in September 1972, by Vertigo Records. It was the first album by Black Sabbath not produced by Rodger Bain; guitarist Tony Iommi assumed production duties. Patrick Meehan, the band&#x27;s then-manager, was listed as co-producer, though his actual involvement in the album&#x27;s production was minimal.

==Recording==
Though the production of &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is officially credited to Black Sabbath and Patrick Meehan, the bulk of the actual production was performed by guitarist Tony Iommi. &quot;It&#x27;s the first album we&#x27;ve produced ourselves,&quot; said vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1972. &quot;Previously we had Rodger Bain as a producer – and, although he&#x27;s very good, he didn&#x27;t really feel what the band was doing. It was a matter of communication. This time, we did it with Patrick (Meehan), our manager, and I think we&#x27;re all very happy… It was great to work in an American studio.&quot; Meehan had little actual involvement in the album&#x27;s production but nonetheless insisted he be listed as producer, according to Iommi.

The recording was plagued with problems, many due to substance abuse. In the studio, the band regularly had speaker boxes full of cocaine delivered.

Struggling to record &quot;Cornucopia&quot; after &quot;sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs&quot;, drummer Bill Ward feared that he was about to be fired: &quot;I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just horrible. I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like &#x27;Well, just go home, you&#x27;re not being of any use right now.&#x27; I felt like I&#x27;d blown it, I was about to get fired.&quot; According to the book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot;, Ward &quot;was always a drinker, but rarely appeared drunk. Retrospectively, that might have been a danger sign. Now, his self-control was clearly slipping.&quot; Iommi claims in his autobiography that Ward almost died after a prank-gone-wrong during recording. The Bel Air mansion the band was renting belonged to John du Pont and the band found several spray cans of gold DuPont paint in a room of the house; finding Ward naked and unconscious after drinking heavily, they proceeded to cover the drummer in gold paint from head to toe, blocking his pores and causing him to suffer a seizure.

In his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, Osbourne speaks at length about the sessions: &quot;In spite of all the arsing around, musically those few weeks in Bel Air were the strongest we&#x27;d ever been.&quot; But he admits, &quot;Eventually we started to wonder where the fuck all the coke was coming from ... that coke was the whitest, purest, strongest stuff you could ever imagine. One sniff, and you were king of the universe.&quot; During a show in support of &quot;Vol. 4&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl, the cocaine abuse caught up to Iommi. &quot;Tony had been doing coke literally for days. We all had, but Tony had gone over the edge. He walked off the stage and collapsed,&quot; said Osbourne. During soundcheck earlier that same day, a crazed Christian man attempted to storm the stage and stab Iommi with a dagger, but he was tackled by members of the band&#x27;s crew. According to Butler, &quot;we wanted to take a break&quot; at that point. 

Osbourne also recounts the band&#x27;s ongoing anxiety over the possibility of being busted, which worsened after they went to the cinema to see &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), about undercover New York City cops busting an international heroin-smuggling ring. &quot;By the time the credits rolled,&quot; Osbourne recalled, &quot;I was hyperventilating.&quot; In 2013, Butler admitted to &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine that heroin, too, had entered the picture: &quot;We sniffed it, we never shot up ... I didn&#x27;t realise how nuts things had gotten until I went home and the girl I was with didn&#x27;t recognise me.&quot;

==Composition==
&quot;Vol. 4&quot; saw Black Sabbath expand beyond the heavy sound they had become known for. In June 2013 &quot;Mojo&quot; declared, &quot;If booze and dope had helped fuel Sabbath&#x27;s earlier albums, &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is their cocaine ... Despite their spiraling addictions, musically &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is another ambitious outing. The band&#x27;s heavy side remains intact on the likes of &#x27;Tomorrow&#x27;s Dream&#x27;, &#x27;Cornucopia&#x27; and the seismic &#x27;Supernaut&#x27; (a firm favorite of Frank Zappa, featuring Bill Ward&#x27;s soul-inspired breakdown), but the guitar intro on &#x27;St. Vitus Dance&#x27; possesses a jaunty, Led Zeppelin-flavoured quality, while &#x27;Laguna Sunrise&#x27; is an evocative neo-classical Iommi instrumental.&quot; After being up all night and watching the sunrise at Laguna Beach, Iommi composed the song. In the studio, an orchestra accompanied Iommi&#x27;s guitar, although they refused to perform until their parts were properly written out. The same orchestra performed on &quot;Snowblind&quot;.

&quot;Snowblind&quot; is the band&#x27;s most obvious reference to cocaine, their drug of choice during this period. &quot;Snowblind&quot; was also the album&#x27;s working title, but Vertigo Records executives were reluctant to release an album with such an obvious drug reference. The liner notes thank &quot;the great COKE-cola&quot; and, in his autobiography, Osbourne notes, &quot;&quot;Snowblind&quot; was one of Black Sabbath&#x27;s best-ever albums – although the record company wouldn&#x27;t let us keep the title, &#x27;cos in those days cocaine was a big deal, and they didn&#x27;t want the hassle of a controversy. We didn&#x27;t argue.&quot;

Although most of the album is in the band&#x27;s trademark heavy style, some songs demonstrate a more sensitive approach. &quot;Changes&quot;, for example, written by Iommi with lyrics by Butler, is a piano ballad with mellotron. Iommi taught himself to play the piano after finding one in the ballroom of the Bel-Air mansion they were renting. It was on this piano that &quot;Changes&quot; was composed. &quot;Tony just sat down at the piano and came up with this beautiful riff,&quot; Osbourne writes in his memoir. &quot;I hummed a melody over the top, and Geezer wrote these heartbreaking lyrics about the break-up Bill was going through with his wife. I thought that was brilliant from the moment we recorded it.&quot;

&quot;FX&quot; came about unexpectedly in the studio. After smoking hashish, the crucifix hanging from Iommi&#x27;s neck accidentally struck the strings of his guitar and the band took an interest in the odd sound produced. An echo effect was added and the band proceeded to hit the guitar with various objects to generate odd sound effects. Iommi calls the song &quot;a total joke&quot;.

Of &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot;, Henry Rollins said: &quot;It&#x27;s about alienation and being lost in the wheels of confusion, which is the way I find myself a lot of the time. Sabbath could be my favourite band. It&#x27;s the ultimate lonely man&#x27;s rock. There&#x27;s something about their music that&#x27;s so painful and yet so powerful.&quot;

The album, Tony Iommi told &quot;Circus&quot;&#x27;s sister magazine &quot;Circus Raves&quot;, &quot;was such a complete change – we felt we had jumped an album, really ... We had tried to go too far.&quot;

==Artwork==

The album was originally to be titled &quot;Snowblind&quot; in reference to both the song &quot;Snowblind&quot; and the amount of cocaine they took while recording. However, according to Geezer, the record label thought this was too edgy and retitled the album &quot;Vol. 4&quot; and changed the artwork while the band was on vacation. &quot;Vol. 4&quot; final cover features a monochrome photograph of Ozzy Osbourne with hands raised and two fingers extended, taken during a Black Sabbath concert at Birmingham Town Hall in January 1972 by Keith McMillan (credited as Keef). The album&#x27;s original release (on Vertigo in the UK, on Warner Bros. in the United States and on Nippon Phonogram in Japan) features a gatefold sleeve with a page glued into the middle. Each band member is given his own photo page, with the band on-stage at the very centre. All photos were from the aforementioned Birmingham gig.

The album&#x27;s original cover art has proved iconic, and has been imitated and parodied on numerous occasions, such as on the 1992 &quot;Peaceville Volume 4&quot; compilation album, the 1992 &quot;Volume Two&quot; EP by the band Sleep, &quot;Longmont Potion Castle Vol. 4&quot; by the prank caller Longmont Potion Castle, and the 1994 &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; EP by Pantera.

The U.S. 8-track tape and cassette releases of the album feature alternate artwork: a yellow background with Ozzy silhouetted in black.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Vol. 4&quot; was released in September 1972, and while most critics of the era were dismissive of the album, it achieved gold status in less than a month, and was the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive release to sell one million copies in the United States. It reached number 13 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; pop album chart and number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. The song &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Dream&quot; was released as a single but failed to chart. Following an extensive tour of the United States, the band toured Australia for the first time in 1973, and later Europe.

Rock critic Lester Bangs, who had derided the band&#x27;s earlier albums, applauded &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, writing in &quot;Creem&quot;, &quot;We have seen the Stooges take on the night ferociously and go tumbling into the maw, and Alice Cooper is currently exploiting it for all it&#x27;s worth, turning it into a circus. But there&#x27;s only one band that&#x27;s dealt with it honestly on terms meaningful to vast portions of the audience, not only grappling with it in a mythic structure that&#x27;s both personal and powerful but actually managing to prosper as well. And that band is Black Sabbath.&quot; Bangs also compared the band&#x27;s lyrics to those of Bob Dylan and William S. Burroughs. In June 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Vol. 4&quot; at number 60 in its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; and described the album as &quot;the sound of drug-taking, beer-guzzling hooligans from Britain&#x27;s oft-pilloried cultural armpit let loose in LA.&quot; In his 2013 biography on the band &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot;, Mick Wall insists &quot;Under the Sun&quot; would become the &quot;sonic signpost&quot; for bands that would follow Sabbath in years to come, such as Iron Maiden and Metallica. Frank Zappa has identified &quot;Supernaut&quot; as one of his all-time favorites. (In a 1994 interview with &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot;, Butler revealed, &quot;I loved Zappa&#x27;s lyric approach. That influenced me lyrically, definitely.&quot;) &quot;Supernaut&quot; was also one of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham&#x27;s favourite songs.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No. 48 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 14th on their 2017 list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 1991, Chuck Eddy ranked &quot;Vol. 4&quot; at number 139 in his list of the 500 best heavy metal albums. Noting that some early fans &#x27;jumped ship&#x27; with &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, Eddy says that other fans regard it as Black Sabbath&#x27;s best album, which he credits to the album&#x27;s &#x27;jazz&#x27;, highlighting parts of &quot;Cornucopia&quot; and a section near the end of &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot; for boasting a captivating &quot;trancy mesh of thump&quot; in the beat, also adding that &quot;Supernaut&quot; is an &quot;astonishing funk-frug&quot; that is comparable to Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Black Satin&quot; (1972). &quot;FX&quot;, an electronic experiment, has been cited by Eddy as &quot;&quot;pre-dub&quot; dub-metal&quot; for its psychedelic-style delay, with &quot;protodub echoes&quot;.

==Track listing==
All music was written by Black Sabbath (Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Ward); all lyrics by Geezer Butler. Some North American pressings have parts of the songs titled as &quot;The Straightener&quot; and &quot;Every Day Comes and Goes&quot;; the former is the coda of &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot;, while the latter is a two-minute segment that serves as the bridge for &quot;Under the Sun&quot;. These parts are not titled on original releases or any European release.

* Disc four of the 2021 &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition features live recordings from two performances from 1973 that have been mixed in 2020 by Richard Digby-Smith. Tracks 1–4 and 7–12 were recorded on 16 March 1973 at the Rainbow Theatre in London, England, and tracks 5–6 were recorded on 11 March 1973 at the Hardrock Concert Theatre in Manchester, England. Tracks 3 and 5–12 were previously released on the 1980 live album Live at Last, while tracks 1, 2 and 4 were previously unreleased. The March 11 and 16 concerts were originally recorded for use in a planned live album release, but the project was ultimately scrapped despite its plans being already promoted in UK newspaper articles.

<text>Brigade Nord (Brig. N.; Northern Brigade) is the major combat formation and only brigade of the Norwegian Army, consisting of eight battalions and one military police company. It is mostly based in Troms (Bardu Municipality and Målselv Municipality) north of the Arctic Circle.

The brigade consists of both conscripted and enlisted personnel. When fully operational, the brigade is able to conduct operations across the entire conflict spectrum, from peace to war, including high-intensity, mechanised land operations with support from other defence branches and allied forces.

== Organization ==
Responsible for the eight battalions, Brigade Nord ensures that they are equipped and trained to operate together. Brigade Nord is a complete, tactical joint system that has the overall command, ensuring cooperation and effectiveness across the battalions. Brigade Nord is largely organised according to the same principles today as when it was established in 1953, as the Brigade in Northern Norway, with subdivisions representing a dedicated subject field. Brigade Nord currently consists of eight battalions, brigade staffs and a military police company, which in total account for about 5,000 soldiers.

** Reconnaissance Battalion (Etterretningsbataljonen), in Setermoen
** Military Police Company (Militærpolitikompaniet), in Bardufoss
The brigade is in the process of reorganisation. A previous transformation of the 2. bataljon to light infantry has been reverted and a fourth mechanised battalion is being formed. The reason for a fourth maneuver battalion stated by the Armed Forces is a NATO requirement four combat battalions in the combat brigades of the organisation, but in the words of Lt.-Col. Espen Strande, the army&#x27;s chief public communications officer, the army has the sufficient armament and equipment for only two. A tender for new main battle tanks for the army is in progress with the 2A7 version of the German Leopard 2 currently operated and the South Korean K2 Black Panther as the two contenders for the order. However the current quantity of tanks in the Norwegian Army is insufficient for four tank squadrons and the Chief of the Army Major-General Lars Lervik has stated a requirement for at least 72 new tanks with a preference for 84 units.

== History ==

Despite the fact that the brigade was first established in 2002, it is a continuation of older decommissioned combat formation. The brigade traces its history back to the end of the second world war, when the British government requested Norwegian military support in the British zone of Allied-occupied Germany. In 1946, the Independent Norwegian Brigade (in Norwegian: Tysklandsbrigaden, ) was founded. This expeditionary brigade consisted of a contingent of 4200 young conscripts, which served six months in Germany, before the next contingent carried on with the service. The brigade, under the command of the Norwegian Army Command Germany (Tysklandskommandoen), was stationed in Schleswig-Holstein. In total, twelve contingents served in Germany between January 1947 and April 1953.

=== Establishment of a northern brigade ===
The Military Committee and the Norwegian Parliament made many changes to the structure and organization of the army in the 1950s. The allied military advisors had recommended that Norway should organize the army into three divisions: 1st Division Command in the east, 3rd Division Command in the south and 6th Division Command in the north. Based on a report from the Norwegian Post-War Army Command, The Norwegian Parliament prepared a draft for a new defence organization, with Parliamentary Proposition no. 2 (1953) “The Organization of the Armed Forces”, which has enormous significance for the Army in the post-war period.

Two of the proposed three division commands were approved. Already in the autumn of 1952, 1st Division Command was operational. The 6th Division Command was organized by the Norwegian Army Command Germany, and the Independent Norwegian Brigade was converted into a combat formation called Brigaden i Nord-Norge.

There were many logistical challenges in the process of moving the German Brigade to Northern Norway. One challenge was deciding in which garrison to place the different brigade detachments. Another urgent challenge was that not all the establishments were ready to accommodate the battalions. In 1951, the Norwegian Parliament adopted a three-year building program, in order to be able to house the brigade soldiers and officers. This national building program had a price tag of 735 million kroner, of which 60 million went to the newly established brigade in Northern Norway.

=== Operational brigade in the Cold War ===

The brigade was formally declared operational on September 1, 1953. As a result of the parliaments&#x27;s introduction of a new army system in 1953, the standing brigades were to be made up of conscripted soldiers in their initial service. Unlike the German Brigade, the young men now served one year in their respective detachments.

The brigade in Northern Norway had two main functions: As a standing unit, it was an essential part of the land military invasion defense in Northern Norway; as a complete brigade, with all types of weapons and troops, it was an important training institution for the field army.

During the Cold War, the brigade was central to the defense against a possible invasion from the Soviet Union. The brigade was stationed in the eastern valleys of Troms, which was defined as the defensive center of gravity for the territorial defense. Here, the brigade was to ensure that the opponent would be stopped and hold out until allied reinforcements could arrive. For a long time, defense planning was based on the assumption that the region of Finnmark could not be held, and that Norway had to be prepared for invasion from the east, both into Finnmark and through Finland. Parts of the brigade were therefore on high alert for long periods of time, down to 30 minutes, in order to meet an attack. A parliamentary decision from July 1953 stipulated that the two standing brigades in the new army structure should act as standing contingency forces in exposed areas, until mobilization was initiated.

Throughout its existence, the brigade was central to the training and education of Norwegian army soldiers and units, from all types of troops. The soldiers were trained in basic military skills while practicing under the special and demanding conditions in Northern Norway.

=== Decommissioning and rebirth ===

In 1995, the 42-year-old brigade was disbanded in favor of a new defense arrangement. The motivation behind this change was the 1992 Defense Study, which concluded that a strong invasion defense in Troms was still necessary, but the operation needed to be more cost-effective than before. From August 1996, the Brigade in Northern Norway ceased to be an operational brigade, and the garrisons of the brigade became independent garrisons directly under the command of the 6th Division Command. In 2002, the brigade was reestablished as Brigade Nord ().

<text>, or Kiminozo for short, is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Âge and released on August 3, 2001, for Windows. It was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. The gameplay in &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the eight female main characters by the player character.

The game was adapted into a 14-episode anime television series, which aired between October 2003 and January 2004. Funimation licensed and distributed the anime in North America under the title Rumbling Hearts. The series was also licensed for release by Revelation Films in the United Kingdom and Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand, under the title &quot;Rumbling Hearts: Kiminozo&quot;. It was one of the first anime shows to be officially made available for the iPod through the iTunes Store and is also available through Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live Marketplace. A four-episode OVA series called &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Next Season&quot; was released between December 2007 and December 2008. The OVA series follows an alternate ending that centers around Haruka.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Takayuki Narumi. Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game&#x27;s duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story&#x27;s narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Takayuki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs becomes available on the game&#x27;s title screen. &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

There are eight main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. The game is divided into two chapters, with the first one revolving around the events leading up to August 20 and the second chapter set three years later. It is in the second chapter that the game allows the player to choose to pursue one of the eight heroines and also has endings if the player chooses to pursue more than one of the girls at the same time. The updated version for Windows Vista, &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Latest Edition&quot;, contains a third chapter. The original Windows edition has 14 endings, and the DVD version for Windows has two additional bad endings. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Takayuki and a given heroine having sex. Later, the consumer port versions were released without the adult content.

==Plot==
&quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot;″s story revolves around the main protagonist Takayuki Narumi, a male high school student. The first chapter, which takes place between July 6 and August 20, 1998, serves as a prologue to the second chapter. Takayuki is set up with Haruka Suzumiya by their friends Mitsuki Hayase and Shinji Taira. Takayuki ends up in bed with a nude sprawled out Haruka, but their relationship is not consummated due to performance anxiety. Mitsuki stops Takayuki on her birthday and has him buy her a ring, which results in him being late for his date with Haruka. At the end of the chapter, caused by Takayuki not being able to arrive in time, Haruka ends up in a coma because of an accident. In chapter two, during the three years since the accident, Mitsuki has been taking care of Takayuki and they have formed a relationship. Takayuki has also taken a part-time job at the Daikuuji (Sky Temple) family restaurant. Haruka&#x27;s sister contacts Takayuki to tell him that Haruka has come out of her coma and is asking to see him.

==Characters==
:
:As the protagonist, Takayuki Narumi meets Haruka a year before Mitsuki sets them up during their third year of high school. When he witnesses the still fresh pool of blood next to Haruka&#x27;s bloodied hair ribbons lying among the shattered glass of the phone booth, Later in the story, he works at a restaurant chain owned by the Sky Temple financial group called &quot;The Family Restaurant&quot;, after having regressed in his studies resulting from the accident. In Haruka&#x27;s absence, he gradually begins to develop a relationship with Mitsuki. In the game the player assumes this role and can choose to pursue and end up with most of the female characters.
:
:Being a shy, timid girl, Haruka is set up with Takayuki by her friend, Mitsuki, while she is in high school. The two quickly become close, and develop an intimate relationship. She is involved in a serious accident and ends up in a coma. The main thrust of the story begins when she awakens three years later. She is afflicted with anterograde amnesia, and because of her delicate psyche, her family and Takayuki conceal the truth that three years have passed, which forms much of the tension in the series.
:
:Mitsuki is friends with both Takayuki and Haruka, but secretly she has feelings for Takayuki. In high school she was a competitive swimmer, but shortly after Haruka&#x27;s accident, she finds herself leaving swimming to tend to Takayuki. She finally reveals her feelings to Takayuki.
:
:Haruka&#x27;s younger sister initially treats both Takayuki and Mitsuki as older siblings until she finds out they have been seeing each other behind the comatose Haruka&#x27;s back. While Haruka is in hospital, she visits her every day. She, like Mitsuki, is a competitive swimmer, but feels as if she can never match Mitsuki, who she initially looks up to. Later, there are hints given that Akane feels something more for Takayuki, but these are not explored fully in the anime television series.
:
:Although being friends with Takayuki, Haruka and Mitsuki in high school, he drifts off from the group after graduation. However, he becomes an important character towards the end of the series. He sometimes presents a counter-balance to the drama of the rest of the characters, as his relationship with his girlfriend (who remains off-screen) seems to be going well.
;
: (Ayu)
: (Mayu)
:They are two waitresses who work at the same restaurant as Takayuki. Ayu is the surly daughter of the chief executive officer of the &quot;Sky Temple&quot; financial group, who owns and operates the restaurant chain. As such, she is permitted to work at the restaurant as part of a market study by the financial group on the condition she does not reveal her identity. She works in order to experience society. Mayu is a soft-spoken but well-meaning klutz who has lost her parents and older brother. While serving as love interests in the game, they provide the only comic relief in the anime. After the credits of several episodes in the anime television series, a 30-second short known as the &quot;Ayu-Mayu Theater&quot; shows them in a comical situation totally irrelevant to the main story with all characters super deformed.
;
: (Hotaru)
: (Fumio)
: (Manami)
:They are three nurses at the hospital. Hotaru and Fumio attended nursing school together and are very close friends. Hotaru Amakawa suffers from a terminal illness that stopped her physical development so that she looks like a very young girl. She is often referred to as &quot;Fumio&#x27;s child&quot;, as Hotaru has a very child like stature whereas Fumio has a very curvy and maternal stature. The two are inseparable. Manami, the green-haired nurse, is a student nurse who attended the same high school as Takayuki. Manami has a very strong mothering instinct with a desire to take care of people, hence her chosen profession. In the game, Manami is introduced in the first chapter and also is in love with Takayuki, but is also too shy to express her feelings for him. All three nurses are potential love interests in the game. The original Manami ending was so disturbing that fans wrote to the company calling to change it; DVD and PS2 versions of the game have a new ending for her route. In the anime, Manami&#x27;s role is reduced to one line and several silent cameos. Hotaru is given several short scenes in the hospital, where she drops many sexual innuendos into her conversations with Takayuki.
:
:She is the doctor in charge of Haruka. She is the elder sister of Mitsuko Kōzuki from &quot;Kimi ga Ita Kisetsu&quot; and Yūko Kōzuki from &quot;Muv-Luv&quot;.

===Anime===

An anime television series based on the game which was animated and produced by Studio Fantasia first aired across Japan from October 5, 2003 to January 4, 2004. The plot consists of a blend of multiple storylines from the game, mostly the Mitsuki route with a bit of Haruka&#x27;s route mixed with elements from the Akane route. The general fate of Amakawa is also disclosed through one scene between Fumio and Takayuki with a line by Fumio at the end of the final episode indicating she died. Manami is limited to one line at the very end and several dialogueless cameos. Materials not included in the game, due to its perspective being in first person, such as depictions of Mitsuki having sex with Shinji (in certain routes) and Haruka telling Mitsuki that she has a crush on Takayuki while walking home, are also included.

The anime was later licensed for American distribution by Funimation Entertainment under the title &quot;Rumbling Hearts: Kiminozo&quot;. It was originally released in three DVD volumes between December 2006 and March 2007, and was later re-released in a box set in August 2007. The writers for the English dub of the anime in the North American release received a mixed reception for taking a liberal approach while producing the script. This resulted in an interpretive script, which at several points reworks the dialogue. By contrast, the writers for the subtitle script in the North American release produced a script which is more faithful in its translation, going as far as including honorifics. In addition to the differences in dialogue, there is also a marked difference in the displayed level of affect between the Japanese and English voicework, though both were generally well received. For the most part, Takayuki&#x27;s Japanese voice actor portrays him as severely emotionally numbed (dissociated), consistent with PTSD (one of the major themes). The English voice actor does not perform the role this way.

A four-episode original video animation (OVA) series, animated by Brain&#x27;s Base and distributed by Bandai Visual, was released between December 21, 2007, and December 19, 2008, on DVD in regular and limited editions. The limited editions contained a bonus CD soundtrack with each DVD and a different cover artwork. The story of the OVAs follows Haruka&#x27;s route, in contrast to the TV series&#x27; modified version of Mitsuki&#x27;s route. Haruka Suzumiya awakens after a three-year coma. Time has deprived her of many important things, but one still remains: her love for Takayuki Narumi. They visit various places they remember, as if to recover the time that was lost. However, there is one place they refuse to visit: the phone booth in front of the Hiiragi-cho station, where Haruka had her accident three years ago.

A comedy ONA titled &quot;Ayumayu Gekijou&quot; that was broadcast from September to December 2006 on Kiminozo Radio&#x27;s homepage with four episodes, and the remaining three episodes were included in the DVD, which was released in February 2007. The main characters are SD versions of Ayu and Mayu, and various other characters. Although it is technically a &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; show, many characters and even a senjutsuki (type-00 Takemikazuchi, Meiya custom) from &quot;Muv-Luv&quot; show up. The series contains many references to &quot;Muv-Luv&quot; (for example, in the second episode, Ayu uses an S-11 SDS and Haruka is turned into a 00 Unit) and the fourth episode is more a parody of &quot;Muv-Luv Alternative&quot;. The series&#x27; main theme is by Uyamuya, while the song &quot;Carry On&quot; by Masaaki Endou is used as an insert song.

==Music==
&quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; has two pieces of theme music: one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme is &quot;Rumbling hearts&quot; by Minami Kuribayashi and the ending theme is by Rino. Four cold open theme songs were added in subsequent releases of the game: &quot;Yours&quot; by Kuribayashi for the Dreamcast port, by Kuribayashi for the PlayStation 2 port, &quot;Blue tears&quot; by Kuribayashi and Tomoko Ishibashi for &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: DVD Specification&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Passion&quot; by Kuribayashi for &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Latest Edition&quot;. The ending theme by CooRie was added for chapter three in &quot;Latest Edition&quot;. &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Special Fandisk&quot; features four ending themes for the first chapter: Haruka&#x27;s theme is by Kuribayashi, Mitsuki&#x27;s theme is &quot;Silver Ring&quot; by Ishibashi, Akane&#x27;s theme is &quot;Innocence&quot; by Tomomi Uehara, and the theme for the normal ending is &quot;Rumbling Hearts&quot; by Kuribayashi.

The &quot;Rumbling Hearts&quot; anime television series has two main theme songs: the opening theme &quot;Precious Memories&quot;, and the ending theme , which are both sung by Kuribayashi. Two additional songs by Kuribayashi were also used: &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; as the ending theme of episode two, and as an insert song. The ending theme for episode 14 is &quot;Rumbling Hearts&quot; by Rino. For &quot;Rumbling Hearts: Next Season&quot;, the opening theme is &quot;Next Season&quot; and the ending theme is &quot;Eternity&quot;; both songs are sung by Kuribayashi.

==Reception and legacy==
On release, the video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 31 out of 40. The anime series was reviewed at Anime News Network, where reviewer Theron Martin commented that &quot;Rumbling Hearts&quot; &quot;proves to be an involving and compelling look at how tragedy can impact matters of the heart.&quot; He also commented that the series&#x27; slow pacing, especially during the first two episodes, were a problem, comparing it to &quot;Saikano&quot;, although it worked better in later episodes. He also stated that the animation was not adequate, stating that &quot;The character artistry looks good enough to support the story and offers a wide variety of physical appearances for its female characters, but often isn&#x27;t fully integrated with the backgrounds and has a not-completely-refined quality about it in many scenes.&quot;

===Appearances in other media===

Characters from &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; can be seen in other works by Âge. Akane is the main heroine in the &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; spin-off and &quot;Muv-Luv&quot; prequel &quot;Akane Maniax&quot;. She also appears in &quot;Muv-Luv&quot; as a student in Hakuryou Hiiragi.

Several characters appear in the alternate world sequel to &quot;Muv-Luv&quot;, &quot;Muv-Luv Alternative&quot;.

Haruka, Mitsuki, and Akane are members of the special task force A-01, also known as the Isumi Valkyries, while Homura Manami is a nurse at the Yokohama base. Takayuki is also mentioned, but he was killed in action prior to the start of the game. In the epilogue, Haruka and Mitsuki can be seen walking around together near the station, Mitsuki with her pre-accident hairstyle. This suggests that the events of &quot;Kimi ga Nozomu Eien&quot; may be taken by future games to have never happened, allowing for Mitsuki and Haruka to show up as best friends in newer games as they did in &quot;Alternative&quot;.

<doc id="424581" wikidata="Q3593064" url="?curid=424581" title="Douglas Island">
<text>Douglas Island () is a tidal island in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is part of the city and borough of Juneau, just west of downtown Juneau and east of Admiralty Island. It is separated from mainland Juneau by the Gastineau Channel, and contains the communities of Douglas and West Juneau.

==History==
Douglas Island was named for John Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, by Captain George Vancouver. Joseph Whidbey, master of during Vancouver&#x27;s expedition, was the first to sight it in 1794. In 1886, people began to travel to Douglas Island to settle near the developing Treadwell gold mine. By 1902, the Douglas Island community had grown to a population of over 2800 residents, as businesses, schools, and homes began to develop alongside the expansion of the nearby gold mine. After the Gastineau Channel flooded the Treadwell mining tunnels in 1917, many residents were forced to move after the town&#x27;s dramatic economic downturn, causing the Douglas population to decrease steadily until the late 1930s.

During the summer of 1962, the Douglas Indian Village was seized and burned down by Douglas city officials and residents in order to forgo the development of the Douglas Harbor project. The Douglas Harbor project, which was initiated by the Douglas tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was a plan to construct a harbor on the Douglas Indian Village site with the intention of having the village rebuilt. In order to obtain control of the project, Douglas city officials invoked eminent domain on the village site while tribal members were fishing at their camps along the Taku River. The tribal members were not compensated for the property and belongings that were lost in the burning of their village and were forced to relocate once they returned to the island.
The Juneau-Douglas Bridge, which was first built in 1935, connected Douglas Island with West Juneau. In 1970, the communities of Douglas and Juneau joined together to form the City and Borough of Juneau. The Juneau-Douglas Bridge was later rebuilt in 1980 to provide a two lane road to and from the island and to accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. There have been plans to build a new bridge from North Douglas to the Mendenhall Valley.

==Geography==
Admiralty Island lies to the west and south, across the Stephens Passage. 
Features of the island include remnants of the Treadwell gold mine, Sandy Beach, the only sand beach in the Juneau area (made from mine tailings), Eaglecrest Ski Area, Perseverance Theatre, and the Douglas Public Library. As a tidal island, Douglas is connected to the mainland at its north end when the Gastineau Channel is at low tide. During low tide, Douglas Island is connected with Juneau&#x27;s Twin Lakes area, the Juneau International Airport as well as other sites. 

Douglas is usually thought of as two areas: downtown Douglas (including West Juneau ), containing Douglas Harbor, Sandy Beach, the mines, the library, Gastineau Elementary, the theatre, the gas station, the few bars and restaurants, and the bridge to Juneau; and North Douglas Island, containing a tank farm, Eaglecrest Ski Area and a heliport.

The island has a land area of and had a population of 5,297 at the 2000 United States Census, with over half of the island&#x27;s population residing in Douglas proper. It is part of the City and Borough of Juneau. The island&#x27;s highest point, Mount Ben Stewart, was named in honor of Benjamin D. Stewart (1878–1976), an early mayor of Juneau.

===Climate===
==Politics==
Following the 2012 election of Merrill Sanford, the incumbent mayor of Juneau, the &quot;Juneau Empire&quot; noted the island&#x27;s &quot;outsized contribution&quot; to Juneau-area politics. Sanford, Byron Mallott (former lieutenant governor of Alaska) and Dennis Egan (currently Juneau&#x27;s representative in the Alaska Senate) live in West Juneau. Sally Smith, who succeeded Egan as mayor, lives in the Lawson Creek neighborhood between Douglas and West Juneau, while her successor Bruce Botelho lives in Douglas. Beth Kerttula, who represented portions of Juneau in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1999 to 2014, lives in North Douglas. Additionally, John Dimond, the first Juneau-based justice of the Alaska Supreme Court, lived in Douglas, while his successor Robert Boochever lived along the Douglas Highway a half-mile north of Douglas&#x27;s then-city limits.

<text>Hingham ( ) is a town in northern Plymouth County in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Part of the Greater Boston region, it is located on the South Shore of Massachusetts. At the 2020 census, the population was 24,284. Hingham is known for its colonial history and location on Boston Harbor. The town was named after Hingham, Norfolk, England, and was first settled by English colonists in 1633.

== History ==

The town of Hingham was dubbed &quot;Bare Cove&quot; by the first colonizing English in 1633, but two years later was incorporated as a town under the name &quot;Hingham.&quot; The land on which Hingham was settled was deeded to the English by the Wampanoag sachem Wompatuck in 1655. The town was within Suffolk County from its founding in 1643 until 1803, and Plymouth County from 1803 to the present. The eastern part of the town split off to become Cohasset in 1770. The town was named for Hingham, a market town in the English county of Norfolk, whence most of the first colonists came, including Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s ancestor Samuel Lincoln (1622–1690), his first American ancestor, who came to Massachusetts in 1637. A statue of President Lincoln adorns the area adjacent to downtown Hingham Square.

Hingham was born of religious dissent. Many of the original founders were forced to flee their native town in Norfolk with both their vicars, Rev. Peter Hobart and Rev. Robert Peck, when they fell afoul of the strict doctrines of the Church of England. Peck was known for what the eminent Norfolk historian Rev. Francis Blomefield called his &quot;violent schismatical spirit&quot;. Peck lowered the chancel railing of the church, in accord with Puritan sentiment that the Anglican church of the day was too removed from its parishioners. He also antagonized ecclesiastical authorities with other forbidden practices.

Hobart, born in Hingham, Norfolk, in 1604 and, like Peck, a graduate of Magdalene College, Cambridge, sought shelter from the prevailing discipline of the high church among his fellow Puritans. The cost to those who emigrated was steep. They &quot;sold their possessions for half their value,&quot; noted a contemporary account, &quot;and named the place of their settlement after their natal town.&quot; (The cost to the place they left behind was also high: Hingham was forced to petition Parliament for aid, claiming that the departure of its most well-to-do citizens had left it hamstrung.)

While most of the early Hingham settlers came from Hingham and other nearby villages in East Anglia, a few Hingham settlers like Anthony Eames came from the West Country of England. The early settlers of Dorchester, Massachusetts, for instance, had come under the guidance of Rev. John White of Dorchester in Dorset, and some of them (like Eames) later moved to Hingham. Accounts from Hingham&#x27;s earliest years indicate some friction between the disparate groups, culminating in a 1645 episode involving the town&#x27;s &quot;trainband&quot;, when some Hingham settlers supported Eames, and others supported Bozoan Allen, a prominent early Hingham settler and Hobart ally who came from King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk. Prominent East Anglian Puritans like the Hobarts and the Cushings, for instance, were used to holding sway in matters of governance. Eventually the controversy became so heated that John Winthrop and Thomas Dudley were drawn into the fray; minister Hobart threatened to excommunicate Eames.

The bitter trainband controversy dragged on for several years, culminating in stiff fines. Eventually a weary Eames, who was in his mid-fifties when the controversy began and who had served Hingham as first militia captain, a selectman, and Deputy in the General Court, threw in the towel and moved to nearby Marshfield where he again served as Deputy and emerged as a leading citizen, despite his brush with the Hingham powers-that-be.

Although the town was incorporated in 1635, the colonists did not get around to negotiating purchase from the Wampanoag, the Native American tribe in the region, until three decades later. On July 4, 1665, the tribe&#x27;s chief sachem, Josiah Wompatuck, sold the township to Capt. Joshua Hobart (brother of Rev. Peter Hobart) and Ensign John Thaxter (father of Col. Samuel Thaxter), representatives of Hingham&#x27;s colonial residents. Having occupied the land for 30 years, the Englishmen presumably felt entitled to a steep discount.
The sum promised Josiah Wompatuck for the land encompassing Hingham was to be paid by two Hingham landowners: Lieut. John Smith and Deacon John Leavitt, who had been granted on Hingham&#x27;s Turkey Hill earlier that year. Now the two men were instructed to deliver payment for their grant to Josiah the chief Sachem. The grant to Smith and Leavitt — who together bought other large tracts from the Native Americans for themselves and their partners—was &quot;on condition that they satisfy all the charge about the purchase of the town&#x27;s land of Josiah—Indian sagamore, both the principal purchase and all the other charge that hath been about it&quot;. With that payment the matter was considered settled.

The third town clerk of Hingham was Daniel Cushing, who emigrated to Hingham from Hingham, Norfolk, with his father Matthew in 1638. Cushing&#x27;s meticulous records of early Hingham enabled subsequent town historians to reconstruct much of early Hingham history as well as that of the early families. Cushing was rather unusual in that he included the town&#x27;s gossip along with the more conventional formal record-keeping.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 15.58%, is water. Hingham is bordered on the east by Cohasset, and Scituate, on the south by Norwell and Rockland, on the west by Weymouth, and on the north by Hingham Bay and Hull. Cohasset and Weymouth are in Norfolk County; the other towns, like Hingham itself, are in Plymouth County. Hingham is southeast of Boston.
Hingham lies along the southwestern corner of Boston Harbor. The bay leads to a harbor, which cuts a U-shaped indentation into the northern shore of the town. The town is separated from Hull by the Weir River and its tributary, which leads to the Straits Pond. The northern third of the town&#x27;s border with Weymouth consists of the Weymouth Back River, which empties out into Hingham Bay. There are several other small ponds and brooks throughout town. The town also has several forests and parks, the largest of which, Wompatuck State Park, spreads into the neighboring towns of Cohasset, Scituate and Norwell. There are also several conservation areas throughout town; the portion of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area in Hingham includes Bumpkin Island, Button Island, Langlee Island, Ragged Island, Sarah Island and the World&#x27;s End Reservation, which juts out into the bay. There is a marina along the mouth of the Weymouth Back River, and a public beach along the harbor.

===Transportation===
A small portion of Route 3 passes through the southwestern corner of town, with one exit in town and another at Route 228 just south of the town line.

Public transportation is currently served by the commuter boat ferry service from the Hingham Shipyard to Rowes Wharf in downtown Boston, the MBTA&#x27;s Bus Route 220, with Route 222 also passing through a small section of town, and the MBTA Commuter Rail to Boston South Station. Commuter rail has been restored along the Greenbush Line through Hingham. Trains stop at two stations in town; West Hingham and Nantasket Junction. As part of the MBTA&#x27;s agreement to restore train service, a tunnel has been built to carry the commuter trains under historic Hingham Square. There were disputes in Hingham about whether to allow the train to pass through the town. Some people felt that Hingham is becoming less like a town and more like a small city. Others felt that the line would benefit the town. Ferries also run from Hingham Shipyard to several islands in Boston Harbor during the summer as well as to Pemberton Point, Hull. There is no air service in the town; the nearest airport is Logan International Airport in Boston as well as smaller public airports in Norwood and Marshfield.

== Notable people ==

Hingham&#x27;s most famous line of citizens came from two unrelated families named Lincoln who emigrated to Massachusetts from the English county of Norfolk in the seventeenth century, from Hingham and Swanton Morley, respectively. A bridge in Hingham over Route 3, the Southeast Expressway, is named after American Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln of the Swanton branch. General Lincoln is best remembered for accepting Cornwallis&#x27;s sword of surrender at the Siege of Yorktown. But the most famous Hingham Lincoln never lived in the town: United States President and Civil War Commander-in-Chief Abraham Lincoln, descended from one of several Lincoln families who settled in Hingham – and unrelated to General Benjamin. A bronze statue, a replica of the famous sitting Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. sits at the foot of Lincoln Street at North Street.

<text>Skype () is a proprietary telecommunications application operated by Skype Technologies, a division of Microsoft, best known for IP-based videotelephony, videoconferencing and voice calls. It also has instant messaging, file transfer, debit-based calls to landline and mobile telephones (over traditional telephone networks), and other features. It is available on various desktop, mobile, and video game console platforms.

Skype was created by Niklas Zennström, Janus Friis, and four Estonian developers, and first released in August 2003. In September 2005, eBay acquired it for $2.6 billion. In September 2009, Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from eBay, valuing the business at $2.92 billion. In May 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion and used it to replace their Windows Live Messenger. As of 2011, most of the development team and 44% of all the division&#x27;s employees were in Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia.

Skype originally featured a hybrid peer-to-peer and client–server system. It became entirely powered by Microsoft-operated supernodes in May 2012; in 2017, it changed from a peer-to-peer service to a centralized Azure-based service. As of February 2023, it was used by 36 million people each day.

In February 2025, Microsoft announced the shutdown of Skype on 5 May in favor of its Microsoft Teams service.

== Etymology ==
The name for the software is derived from &quot;Sky peer-to-peer&quot;, which was then abbreviated to &quot;Skyper&quot;. However, some of the domain names associated with &quot;Skyper&quot; were already taken. Dropping the final &quot;r&quot; left the title &quot;Skype&quot;, for which domain names were available.

== History ==

Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennström, from Sweden, and Janus Friis, from Denmark. The software was created by Estonians Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, Jaan Tallinn, and Toivo Annus. Friis and Annus are credited with the idea of reducing the cost of voice calls by using a P2P protocol like that of Kazaa. An early alpha version was created and tested in spring 2003, and the first public beta version was released on 29 August 2003.

In June 2005, Skype entered an agreement with Polish web portal Onet.pl for an integrated offering on the Polish market. On 12 September 2005, eBay Inc. agreed to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies SA for approximately US$2.5 billion in up-front cash and eBay stock, plus potential performance-based consideration. On 1 September 2009, eBay announced it was selling 65% of Skype to Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for US$1.9 billion, valuing Skype at US$2.75 billion. On 14 July 2011, Skype partnered with Comcast to bring its video chat service to Comcast subscribers via HDTV sets.

On 17 June 2013, Skype released a free video messaging services for Windows, Mac OS, iOS, iPadOS, Android, and BlackBerry.

Between 2017 and 2020, Skype collaborated with PayPal to provide a money-send feature, enabling users to transfer funds via the Skype mobile app in the middle of a conversation.

In 2019, Skype was declared the sixth most-downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.

=== Microsoft acquisition ===

On 10 May 2011, Microsoft Corporation acquired Skype Communications, S.à r.l for US$8.5 billion. It was incorporated as a division of Microsoft, which acquired all its technologies with the purchase. The acquisition was completed on 13 October 2011. Microsoft began integrating the Skype service with its own products. Along with taking over the development of existing Skype desktop and mobile apps, it developed a dedicated client app for its then-newly released, touch-focused Windows 8 and Windows RT operating systems, which were made available from Windows Store when the then-new OS launched on 26 October 2012. The following year, it became the default messaging app for Windows 8.1, replacing the Windows 8 Messaging app at the time, and was pre-installed on every device that came with or upgraded to 8.1.

In a month-long transition from 8 to 30 April 2013, Microsoft discontinued two of its own products in favor of Skype, including its Windows Live Messenger instant messaging service, although Messenger continued to be available in mainland China until October 2014. 

On 11 November 2014, Microsoft announced that in 2015, its Lync product would be replaced by Skype for Business, combining the features of Lync and the consumer Skype software. Organizations that used it could switch their users between the default Skype for Business interface and the Lync interface.

=== Post-acquisition ===
On 12 August 2013, Skype released the 4.10 update for Apple iPhone and iPad apps that allowed HD quality video for iPhone 5 and fourth-generation iPads.

On 20 November 2014, Microsoft Office&#x27;s team announced that a new chat powered by Skype would be implemented in their software, enabling users to chat with co-workers in the same document.

On 15 September 2015, Skype announced the release of Mojis (&quot;a brand new way to express yourself on Skype&quot;)—short video clips and GIFs featuring characters from films and TV shows that could be entered into conversations like emoticons. Skype worked with Universal Studios, Disney Muppets, BBC and other studios to enhance the Mojis collection. Later that year, Gurdeep Singh Pall, Corporate Vice President of Skype, announced that Microsoft had acquired the technology from Talko.

In July 2016, Skype introduced an early Alpha version of a new Skype for Linux client, built with WebRTC technology, after several petitions asked Microsoft to continue development for Linux. In September of that year, Skype updated their iOS app with new features, including an option to call contacts on Skype through Siri voice commands. In October of that year, Microsoft launched Skype for Business for Mac.

In February 2017, Microsoft announced plans to discontinue its Skype Wi-Fi service globally. The application was delisted, and the service itself became non-functional from 31 March 2017. On 5 June 2017, Microsoft announced its plans to revamp Skype with similar features to Snapchat, allowing users to share temporary copies of their photos and video files. In late June 2017, Microsoft rolled out their latest update for iOS, incorporating a revamped design and new third-party integrations, with platforms including Gfycat, YouTube, and UpWorthy. It was not well-received, with numerous negative reviews and complaints that the new client broke existing functionality. Skype later removed this &quot;makeover&quot;. In December 2017, Microsoft added &quot;Skype Interviews&quot;, a shared code editing system for those wishing to hold job interviews for programming roles.

In April 2017, Microsoft eventually moved the service from a peer-to-peer to a central server based system, enabling cloud-based storage of text messages/pictures and temporary 30-day storage of videos/file attachments/voice messages/call recordings. It also adjusted the user interfaces of apps to make text-based messaging more prominent than voice calling. Skype for Windows, iOS, Android, Mac and Linux all received significant visual overhauls at this time. Users with legacy Skype accounts were able to retain their usernames, while new users are no longer able to manually choose a username. New user registrations associated with a Microsoft account are assigned a username with a codice_1 prefix followed by an autogenerated alphanumeric string.

In an interview with &quot;The Verge&quot; in February 2025, Microsoft announced that Skype would be shutting down on 5 May 2025, to be replaced with the free version of Microsoft Teams.

== Features ==

Registered users of Skype are identified by a unique Skype ID and may be listed in the Skype directory under a Skype username. Skype allows these registered users to communicate through both instant messaging and voice chat. Voice chat allows telephone calls between pairs of users and conference calling and uses proprietary audio codec. Skype&#x27;s text chat client allows group chats, emoticons, storing chat history, and editing of previous messages. Offline messages were implemented in a beta build of version 5 but removed after a few weeks without notification. The usual features familiar to instant messaging users—user profiles, online status indicators, and so on—are also included.

The &quot;Online Number&quot;, a.k.a. SkypeIn, service allows Skype users to receive calls on their computers dialed by conventional phone subscribers to a local Skype phone number; local numbers are available for Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A Skype user can have local numbers in any of these countries, with calls to the number charged at the same rate as calls to fixed lines in the country.

Skype supports conference calls, video chats, and screen sharing between 25 people at a time for free, which then increased to 50 on 5 April 2019.

Skype does not provide the ability to call emergency numbers, such as 112 in Europe, 911 in North America, 999 in the UK or 100 in India and Nepal. However, as of December 2012, there is limited support for emergency calls in the United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, and Finland. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that, for the purposes of section 255 of the Telecommunications Act, Skype is not an &quot;interconnected VoIP provider&quot;. As a result, the U.S. National Emergency Number Association recommends that all VoIP users have an analog line available as a backup.

In 2019, Skype added an option to blur the background in a video chat interface using AI algorithms purely done using software, despite a depth-sensing camera not being present in most webcams.

In 2023, Skype added the Bing AI chatbot to the platform for users who had access to the chatbot.

== Usage and traffic ==

At the end of 2010, there were over 660 million worldwide users, with over 300 million estimated active each month as of August 2015. At one point in February 2012, there were 34 million users concurrently online on Skype.

In January 2011, after the release of video calling on the Skype client for iPhone, Skype reached a record 27 million simultaneous online users. This record was broken with 29 million simultaneous online users on 21 February 2011 and again on 28 March 2011 with 30 million online users. On 25 February 2012, Skype announced that it has over 32 million users for the first time ever. By 5 March 2012, it had 36 million simultaneous online users, and less than a year later, on 21 January 2013, Skype had more than 50 million concurrent users online.
In June 2012, Skype had surpassed 70 million downloads on Android.

On 19 July 2012, Microsoft announced that Skype users had logged 115 billion minutes of calls in the quarter, up to 50% since the last quarter.

On 15 January 2014, TeleGeography estimated that Skype-to-Skype international traffic has gone up to 36% in 2013 to 214 billion minutes.

As of March 2020, Skype was used by 100 million people at least once a month and by 40 million people each day. 

At end March 2020 there was a 70% increase in the number of daily users from the previous month, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Skype also lost a large part of its market share to Zoom.

Skype has continued to experience daily user decline since the pandemic, with the daily user count falling to 36 million in 2023, despite Microsoft&#x27;s effort to promote Skype in their other services such as Microsoft Outlook. The success of Microsoft Teams has been cited as causing businesses to abandon Skype, with Teams reaching 300 million active users in the 2nd quarter of 2023.

== System and software ==
=== Client applications and devices ===
==== Windows client ====

Multiple different versions of Skype have been released for Windows since its conception. The original line of Skype applications continued from versions 1.0 through 4.0. It has offered a desktop-only program since 2003. Later, a mobile version was created for Windows Phones.

In 2012, Skype introduced a new version for Windows 8 similar to the Windows Phone version. On 7 July 2015, Skype modified the application to direct Windows users to download the desktop version, but it was set to continue working on Windows RT until October 2016. In November 2015, Skype introduced three new applications, called Messaging, Skype Video, and Phone, intended to provide an integrated Skype experience on Windows 10. On 24 March 2016, Skype announced that the integrated applications did not satisfy most users&#x27; needs and announced that they and the desktop client would eventually be replaced with a new UWP application, which was released as a preview version for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and dubbed as the stable version with the release of the Windows 10 Creators Update.

The latest version of Skype for Windows is Skype 11, which is based on the Universal Windows Platform and runs on various Windows 10-related systems, including Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Windows phones, and Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft still offers the older Skype 8, which is Win32-based and runs on all systems from Windows XP (which is otherwise unsupported by Microsoft) to the most recent release of Windows 10.

In late 2017, this version was upgraded to Skype 12.9, in which several features were both removed and added.

==== Other desktop clients ====

* macOS (10.9 or newer)
* Linux (Debian, Debian-based (Ubuntu, etc.), Fedora, openSUSE)

==== Mobile clients ====
* iOS
* Android
Skype formerly provided a client for feature phones that ran on J2ME, Nokia X, Symbian, BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 devices. 
In May 2009, a Version 3.0 was available on Windows Mobile 5 to 6.1, and in September 2015, a Version 2.29 was available on Windows Phone 8.1; in 2016, Microsoft announced that this would stop working in early 2017 once Skype&#x27;s transition from peer-to-peer to client-server was complete.

==== Other platforms ====
* The Nokia N800, N810, and N900 Internet tablets, which run Maemo
* The Nokia N9, which runs MeeGo, comes with Skype voice calling and text messaging integrated; however, it lacks video calling.
* Both the Sony Mylo COM-1 and COM-2 models
* The PlayStation Portable Slim and Lite series, though the user needs to purchase a specially designed microphone peripheral. The PSP-3000 has a built-in microphone, which allows communication without the Skype peripheral. The PSP Go has the ability to use Bluetooth connections with the Skype application, in addition to its built-in microphone. Skype for PlayStation Vita may be downloaded via the PlayStation Network in the U.S. It includes the capability to receive incoming calls with the application running in the background.
* The Samsung Smart TV had a Skype app, which could be downloaded for free. It used the built-in camera and microphone for the newer models. Alternatively, a separate mountable Skype camera with built-in speakers and microphones is available to purchase for older models. This functionality has now been disabled, along with any other &quot;TV Based&quot; Skype clients.
* Some devices were made to work with Skype by talking to a desktop Skype client or by embedding Skype software into the device. These were usually either tethered to a PC or had a built-in Wi-Fi client to allow calling from Wi-Fi hotspots, like the Netgear SPH101 Skype Wi-Fi Phone, the SMC WSKP100 Skype Wi-Fi Phone, the Belkin F1PP000GN-SK Wi-Fi Skype Phone, the Panasonic KX-WP1050 Wi-Fi Phone for Skype Executive Travel Set, the IPEVO So-20 Wi-Fi Phone for Skype, and the Linksys CIT200 Wi-Fi Phone.
* 3G Skypephone, created in collaboration between Skype and 3 in 2007

==== Third-party licensing ====
Third-party developers, such as Truphone, Nimbuzz, and Fring, previously allowed Skype to run in parallel with several other competing VoIP/IM networks (Truphone and Nimbuzz provide TruphoneOut and NimbuzzOut as a competing paid service) in any Symbian or Java environment. Nimbuzz made Skype available to BlackBerry users, and Fring provided mobile video calling over Skype as well as support for the Android platform. Skype disabled access to Skype by Fring users in July 2010. Nimbuzz discontinued support of Skype on request in October 2010.

Before and during the Microsoft acquisition, Skype withdrew licensing from several third parties producing software and hardware compatible with Skype. The Skype for Asterisk product from Digium was withdrawn as &quot;no longer available for sale&quot;. The Senao SN358+ long-range (10–15 km) cordless phone was discontinued due to loss of licenses to participate in the Skype network as peers. In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.

== Technology ==
=== Protocol ===
Skype uses a proprietary Internet telephony (VoIP) network called the Skype protocol. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are also proprietary. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a peer-to-peer model (originally based on the Kazaa software), rather than the more usual client-server model (note that the very popular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).

On 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol, Microsoft Notification Protocol 24, was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.

As far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the IPv4 protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, IPv6. Skype for Business, however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.

=== Protocol detection and control ===
Many networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype&#x27;s protocol for enterprise and carrier applications. While the specific detection methods used by these companies are often private, Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test and naive Bayes classification are two approaches that were published in 2008. Combining statistical measurements of payload properties (such as byte frequencies and initial byte sequences) as well as flow properties (like packet sizes and packet directions) has also shown to be an effective method for identifying Skype&#x27;s TCP- and UDP-based protocols.

=== Audio codecs ===
Skype 2.x used G.729, Skype 3.2 introduced SVOPC, and Skype 4.0 added a Skype-created codec called :SILK, intended to be &quot;lightweight and embeddable&quot;. Additionally, Skype has released Opus as a free codec, which integrates the SILK codec principles for voice transmission with the CELT codec principles for higher-quality audio transmissions, such as live music performances. Opus was submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in September 2010. Since then, it has been standardized as RFC 6716.

=== Video codecs ===
VP7 is used for versions prior to Skype 5.5.

As of version 7.0, H.264 is used for both group and one-on-one video chat, at standard definition, 720p, and 1080p high-definition.

=== Skype Qik ===
Skype acquired the video service Qik in 2011. After shutting down Qik in April 2014, Skype relaunched the service as Skype Qik on 14 October 2014. Although Qik offered video conferencing and Internet streaming, the new service focuses on mobile video messaging between individuals and groups.

=== Hyperlink format ===
Skype uses URIs as codice_2 for a call.

== Security and privacy ==

Skype was claimed initially to be a secure communication, with one of its early web pages stating &quot;highly secure with end-to-end encryption&quot;. Security services were invisible to the user, and encryption cannot be disabled. Skype claims to use publicly documented, widely trusted encryption techniques for Skype-to-Skype communication: RSA for key negotiation and the Advanced Encryption Standard to encrypt conversations. However, it is impossible to verify that these algorithms are used correctly, completely, and at all times, as there is no public review possible without a protocol specification and/or the program&#x27;s source code. Skype provides an uncontrolled registration system for users with no proof of identity. Instead, users may choose a screen name that does not have to relate to their real-life identity in any way; a name chosen could also be an impersonation attempt, where the user claims to be someone else for fraudulent purposes. A third-party paper analyzing the security and methodology of Skype was presented at Black Hat Europe 2006. It analyzed Skype and found a number of security issues with the then-current security model.

Skype incorporates some features that tend to hide its traffic, but it is not specifically designed to thwart traffic analysis and therefore does not provide anonymous communication. Some researchers have been able to watermark the traffic so that it is identifiable even after passing through an anonymizing network.

In an interview, Kurt Sauer, the Chief Security Officer of Skype, said, &quot;We provide a safe communication option. I will not tell you whether we can listen or not.&quot; This does not deny the fact that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) monitors Skype conversations. Skype&#x27;s client uses an undocumented and proprietary protocol. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is concerned about user privacy issues arising from using proprietary software and protocols and has made a replacement for Skype one of their high-priority projects. Security researchers Biondi and Desclaux have speculated that Skype may have a back door, since Skype sends traffic even when it is turned off and because Skype has taken extreme measures to obfuscate the program&#x27;s traffic and functioning. Several media sources reported that at a meeting about the &quot;Lawful interception of IP based services&quot; held on 25 June 2008, high-ranking unnamed officials at the Austrian interior ministry said that they could listen in on Skype conversations without problems. The Austrian public broadcasting service ORF, citing minutes from the meeting, reported that &quot;the Austrian police are able to listen in on Skype connections&quot;. Skype declined to comment on the reports. One easily demonstrated method of monitoring is to set up two computers with the same Skype user ID and password. When a message is typed or a call is received on one computer, the second computer duplicates the audio and text. This requires knowledge of the user ID and password.

The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has interpreted the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) as requiring digital phone networks to allow wiretapping if authorized by an FBI warrant, in the same way as other phone services. In February 2009, Skype said that, not being a telephone company owning phone lines, it is exempt from CALEA and similar laws, which regulate US phone companies, and it is not clear whether Skype could support wiretapping even if it wanted to. According to the ACLU, the Act is inconsistent with the original intent of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; more recently, the ACLU has expressed concern that the FCC interpretation of the Act is incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU/FCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Microsoft made changes to Skype&#x27;s infrastructure to ease various wiretapping requirements; however, Skype denies the claims.

Sometime before Skype was sold in 2009, the company had started &quot;Project Chess,&quot; a program to explore legal and technical ways to easily share calls with intelligence agencies and law enforcement.

On 20 February 2009, the European Union&#x27;s Eurojust agency announced that the Italian Desk at Eurojust would &quot;play a key role in the coordination and cooperation of the investigations on the use of internet telephony systems (VoIP), such as &#x27;Skype&#x27;. [...] The purpose of Eurojust&#x27;s coordination role is to overcome the technical and judicial obstacles to the interception of internet telephony systems, taking into account the various data protection rules and civil rights.&quot;

In November 2010, a flaw was disclosed to Skype that showed how computer crackers could secretly track any user&#x27;s IP address. Due to Skype&#x27;s peer-to-peer nature, this was a difficult issue to address, but this bug was eventually remedied in a 2016 update.

In 2012, Skype introduced automatic updates to better protect users from security risks, but received some challenge from users of the Mac product, as the updates cannot be disabled from version 5.6 on, both on Mac OS and Windows versions, although in the latter, and only from version 5.9 on, automatic updating can be turned off in certain cases.

According to a 2012 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, Skype &quot;has expanded its cooperation with law enforcement authorities to make online chats and other user information available to police&quot;; the article additionally mentions that Skype made changes to allow authorities access to addresses and credit card numbers.

In November 2012, Skype was reported to have handed over user data of a pro-WikiLeaks activist to Dallas, Texas-based private security company iSIGHT Partners without a warrant or court order. The alleged handover would be a breach of Skype&#x27;s privacy policy. Skype responded with a statement that it launched an internal investigation to probe the breach of user data privacy.

On 13 November 2012, a Russian user published a flaw in Skype&#x27;s security that allowed any person to take over a Skype account knowing only the victim&#x27;s email by following seven steps. This vulnerability was claimed to exist for months and existed for more than 12 hours after being published widely.

On 14 May 2013, it was documented that a URL sent via a Skype instant messaging session was usurped by the Skype service and subsequently used in a HTTP HEAD query originating from an IP address registered to Microsoft in Redmond (the IP address used was 65.52.100.214). The Microsoft query used the full URL supplied in the IM conversation and was generated by a previously undocumented security service. Security experts speculate that the action was triggered by a technology similar to Microsoft&#x27;s SmartScreen Filter used in its browsers.

The 2013 mass surveillance disclosures revealed that agencies such as the NSA and the FBI have the ability to eavesdrop on Skype, including the monitoring and storage of text and video calls and file transfers. The PRISM surveillance program, which requires FISA court authorization, reportedly has allowed the NSA unfettered access to its data center supernodes. According to the leaked documents, integration work began in November 2010, but it was not until February 2011 that the company was served with a directive to comply signed by the attorney general, with NSA documents showing that collection began on 31 March 2011.

On 10 November 2014, Skype scored 1 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s secure messaging scorecard. Skype received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider does not have access to (i.e., the communications are not end-to-end encrypted), users cannot verify contacts&#x27; identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen (i.e., the service does not provide forward secrecy), the code is not open to independent review (i.e., not available to merely view, nor under a free-software license), the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent security audit. AIM, BlackBerry Messenger, Ebuddy XMS, Hushmail, Kik Messenger, Viber, and Yahoo Messenger also scored 1 out of 7 points.

As of August 2018, Skype now supports end-to-end encryption across all platforms.

===Cybercrime on application===
Cybersex trafficking has occurred on Skype and other videoconferencing applications. According to the Australian Federal Police, overseas pedophiles are directing child sex abuse using its live streaming services.

=== Service in the People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
Since September 2007, users in China trying to download the Skype software client have been redirected to the site of TOM Online, a joint venture between a Chinese wireless operator and Skype, from which a modified Chinese version can be downloaded. The TOM client participates in China&#x27;s system of Internet censorship, monitoring text messages between Skype users in China as well as messages exchanged with users outside the country. Niklas Zennström, then chief executive of Skype, told reporters that TOM &quot;had implemented a text filter, which is what everyone else in that market is doing. Those are the regulations.&quot; He also stated, &quot;One thing that&#x27;s certain is that those things are in no way jeopardising the privacy or the security of any of the users.&quot;

In October 2008, it was reported that TOM had been saving the full message contents of some Skype text conversations on its servers, apparently focusing on conversations containing political issues such as Tibet, Falun Gong, Taiwan independence, and the Chinese Communist Party. The saved messages contain personally identifiable information about the message senders and recipients, including IP addresses, usernames, landline phone numbers, and the entire content of the text messages, including the time and date of each message. Information about Skype users outside China who were communicating with a TOM-Skype user was also saved. A server misconfiguration made these log files accessible to the public for a time.

Research on the TOM-Skype venture has revealed information about blacklisted keyword checks, allowing censorship and surveillance of its users. The partnership has received much criticism for the latter. Microsoft remains unavailable for comment on the issue.

According to reports from the advocacy group Great Fire, Microsoft has modified censorship restrictions and ensured encryption of all user information. Furthermore, Microsoft is now partnered with Guangming Founder (GMF) in China.

All attempts to visit the official Skype web page from mainland China redirect the user to skype.gmw.cn. The Linux version of Skype is unavailable.

== Localization ==
Skype comes bundled with the following locales and languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Nepali, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

As the Windows desktop program offers users the option of creating new language files, at least 80 other (full or partial) localizations are also available for many languages.

== Customer service ==
In January 2010, Skype rescinded its policy of seizing funds in Skype accounts that have been inactive (no paid call) for 180 days. This was in settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The company also paid up to US $4 to persons who opted into the action.

As of February 2012, Skype provides support through their web support portal, support community, @skypesupport on Twitter, and Skype Facebook page. Direct contact via email and live chat is available through their web support portal. Chat Support is a premium feature available to Skype Premium and some other paid users.

Skype&#x27;s refund policy states that they will provide refunds in full if customers have used less than €1 of their Skype Credit. &quot;Upon a duly submitted request, Skype will refund you on a pro-rata basis for the unused period of a Product.&quot;

Skype has come under some criticism from users for the inability to completely close accounts. Users not wanting to continue using Skype can make their account inactive by deleting all personal information, except for the username.

Due to an outage on September 21, 2015 that affected several users in New Zealand, Australia, and other countries, Skype decided to compensate their customers with 20 minutes of free calls to over 60 landline and 8 mobile phone destinations.

== Educational use ==
Although Skype is a commercial product, its non-paid version is used with increasing frequency among teachers, schools, and charities interested in global education projects. A popular use case is to facilitate language learning through conversations that alternate between each participant&#x27;s native language.

The video conferencing aspect of the software has been praised for its ability to connect students who speak different languages, facilitate virtual field trips, and engage directly with experts.

Skype in the classroom is another free-of-charge tool that Skype has set up on its website, designed to encourage teachers to make their classrooms more interactive, and collaborate with other teachers around the world. There are various Skype lessons in which students can participate. Teachers can also use a search tool and find experts in a particular field. The educational program Skype a Scientist, set up by biologist Sarah McAnulty in 2017, had in two years connected 14,312 classrooms with over 7000 volunteer scientists.

However, Skype is not adopted universally; some educational institutions in the United States and Europe were blocking the application from their networks.

<text>Ethelbert Woodbridge Nevin (November 25, 1862February 17, 1901) was an American pianist and composer.
==Early life==
Nevin was born on November 25, 1862, at Vineacre, on the banks of the Ohio River, in Edgeworth, Pennsylvania. There he spent the first sixteen years of his life, and received all his schooling, most of it from his father, Robert Peebles Nevin, editor and proprietor of a Pittsburgh newspaper, and a contributor to many magazines. (Robert Nevin also composed several campaign songs, among them the popular &quot;Our Nominee,&quot; used in the day of James K. Polk&#x27;s candidacy.) Nevin&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Duncan Oliphant, was a pianist. The first grand piano ever taken across the Allegheny Mountains was carted over for Nevin&#x27;s mother. Other members of the Nevin family showed musical inclinations as well; Nevin&#x27;s younger brother, Arthur, also achieved some renown as a composer, as did his cousins George and Gordon Balch Nevin.

===Musical education===
From a young age, Nevin was musically inclined. He began playing the piano by the age of four, although he needed cushions piled on the pedals to enable him to reach them. Nevin&#x27;s father provided for his son both vocal and instrumental instruction. He also took him abroad for two years of travel and music study in Dresden under Von Böhme. In 1878, he attended Western University, now known as the University of Pittsburgh, but left at the end of his freshman year in 1879. Later he studied the piano for two years at Boston, under Benjamin Johnson Lang, and composition under Stephen A. Emery.

==Musical career==
After two years studying in Boston, in 1882 Nevin moved back to Pittsburgh, where he gave lessons, and saved money enough to take him to Berlin. There he spent the years 1884, 1885, and 1886, placing himself in the hands of Karl Klindworth. Of him Nevin says: &quot;To Herr Klindworth I owe everything that has come to me in my musical life. He was a devoted teacher, and his patience was tireless. His endeavor was not only to develop the student from a musical standpoint, but to enlarge his soul in every way. To do this, he tried to teach one to appreciate and to feel the influence of such great minds of literature as Goethe, Schiller, and Shakespeare. He used to insist that a man does not become a musician by practising so many hours a day at the piano, but by absorbing an influence from all the arts and all the interests of life, from architecture, painting, and even politics.&quot;

In 1885, Hans von Bülow incorporated the best four pupils of his friend, Klindworth, into an artist class, which he drilled personally. Nevin was one of the honored four, and appeared at the unique public Zuhören of that year, devoted exclusively to the works of Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, and Joachim Raff. Among the forty or fifty studious listeners at these recitals, Frau Cosima Wagner, the violinist Joseph Joachim, and many other celebrities were frequently present.

Nevin returned to America in 1887, and took up his residence in Boston, where he taught and played at occasional concerts.

In 1892 he went to Paris, where he taught singing, and he coached many American and French artists for the operatic stage. In 1893 he moved on to Berlin, where he worked so hard at composition that his health collapsed, and he spent a year in Algiers. The early months of 1895 he spent in concert tours through this country. As Klindworth said of him, &quot;he has a touch that brings tears,&quot; and it is in interpretation rather than in bravura that he excels.

Seeking solitude and the right atmosphere for composition, he went to live in Florence, where he composed his suite &quot;May in Tuscany&quot; (Op. 21). After a year in Venice Nevin made Paris his home for a year, then returned to America, where he remained until his death.

His best-remembered compositions are the piano piece &quot;Narcissus&quot; from &quot;Water Scenes&quot; and the songs &quot;The Rosary&quot; and &quot;Mighty Lak&#x27; a Rose&quot; (lyrics of the latter by Frank Lebby Stanton).

==Personal life, death and commemoration==

Nevin was married to Anne Paul Nevin, with whom he had two children. The Nevin summer home, &#x27;Arcady&#x27;, in Blue Hill, Maine is still owned by his descendants.

Despite being a prominent composer, Nevin had recurring debt towards the end of his life. This situation plagued Nevin with ongoing depression, accompanied by heavy drinking. He overworked himself at times, steadily deteriorating his health. On the night of February 15, 1901, while in New Haven, Connecticut, Nevin had attended a recital given by Harold Bauer. After returning home, however, his health worsened. He had shown symptoms of numbness in his hands, altering his ability to play the piano. On the morning of February 17, he was confined to his bed as his health was becoming more unpredictable. He died later that day on February 17, 1901 in New Haven, Connecticut, aged just 38.

Nevin was commemorated by being pictured on a 1940 ten cent U.S. postage stamp, one of the &quot;Famous Americans&quot; series.

<doc id="424600" wikidata="Q1258672" url="?curid=424600" title="Liberal Democracy of Slovenia">
<text>Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (, LDS) is a social-liberal political party in Slovenia. Between 1992 and 2004, it (and its main predecessor, the Liberal Democratic Party) was the largest (and ruling) party in the country. In the 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election, it failed to win entry to the Slovenian National Assembly. The party was a member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.

The LDS dominated Slovenian politics during the first decade following independence. Except for a brief interruption in 2000, it held the parliamentary majority between 1994 and 2004, when it lost the election to the conservative Slovenian Democratic Party. The loss was followed by decline, infighting and political fragmentation. In the runup to the 2008 parliamentary election the LDS joined in an unofficial coalition with the Social Democrats and Zares, but lost nearly 80% of its seats, dropping from 23 to just 5 and becoming the smallest parliamentary party. In the 2011 parliamentary election on 4 December 2011, its support collapsed even further: it won only 1.48% of the vote, not reaching the parliamentary threshold of 4%. It has not regained seats in parliament or a place as a major political force since, only retaining minor relevance at a local level in some municipalities.

==History==

In 1990, the well-known Slovenian sociologist, philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek was the candidate for the Presidency of Slovenia (an auxiliary body of the President of the Republic, abolished in 1992) for one of the LDS&#x27; predecessor parties, the Union of Socialist Youth of Slovenia – Liberal Party (later the Liberal Democratic Party).

The LDS formed a part of governing coalitions of Slovenia from 1992 to 2004, with an interruption for a few months in 2000. The first Prime Minister of Slovenia from LDS was Janez Drnovšek, who later became the President of Slovenia in 2002 and was succeeded by Anton Rop, former Finance Minister.

At the 2004 European election, LDS won 21.9% of the vote, which yielded two seats in the European Parliament out of Slovenia&#x27;s allocation of seven. At the 2004 elections, the LDS party suffered a considerable loss of votes. The Slovenian Democratic Party became the largest party, and the LDS went into opposition. The party held 23 seats (22.8% votes) in the National Assembly until 2007, when 12 members resigned from the party.

Following the defeat of 2004, the party suffered a succession of severe internal crises and a steady exodus of prominent members. In 2005, Anton Rop resigned as president and was succeeded by Jelko Kacin. Two years later, a group led by Matej Lahovnik and the former Secretary General of the party Gregor Golobič left the LDS and founded a new social liberal political party called Zares, while several other prominent members left for the Social Democrats, including the former Prime Minister Anton Rop. Following these events, Jelko Kacin resigned as President and was succeeded by Katarina Kresal. Following Kresal&#x27;s election as president, several other prominent members, including former Health Minister Dušan Keber, decided to leave the party as well.

In 2008, the party won 5,3% of the votes and five seats, entering the centre-left coalition of Social Democrat Borut Pahor, with two ministers in the government. In the snap elections of 2011, the party failed to enter the Parliament. Due to financial difficulties, the party did not field a slate of candidates in the 2014 (or any subsequent) parliamentary elections. It has not, however, dissolved or merged with another party. In the 2022 Slovenian Presidential Elections, the LDS endorsed Ivo Vajgl, a former member. As of that year, the only offices it still held were the mayoralty and four municipal council seats in the small municipality of Markovci near Ptuj.

<doc id="424601" wikidata="Q721810" url="?curid=424601" title="Iceland (supermarket)">
<text>Iceland Foods Limited, trading as Iceland, is a British supermarket chain headquartered in Deeside, Wales. It mainly sells frozen foods, including prepared meals and vegetables, alongside non-frozen grocery items such as produce, meat, dairy and dry goods. The company also operates a chain of shops called The Food Warehouse.

==History==
Iceland Foods began business in 1970, when Malcolm Walker opened the first store in Leg Street, Oswestry, Shropshire, England, with his business partner Peter Hinchcliffe. Together, they invested £60 for one month&#x27;s rent at the store. They were still employees of Woolworths at the time, and their employment was terminated once their employer discovered their other roles. Iceland Foods initially specialised in loose frozen food. In 1977, they opened a store in Manchester selling own-labelled packaged food, and by 1978 the company had 28 stores.
In 1983, the business grew by purchasing the 18 stores of Bristol-based St. Catherine&#x27;s Freezer Centres, and in 1984 the business went public for the first time. The cash investment was used to purchase 12 stores of South East-based Orchard Frozen Foods (who had gone into administration), AJ &amp; M Freezer Foods, Fulham Freezer Foods and Igloo. The business purchased larger rival Bejam in 1989 after a hostile takeover bid. In 1993, the firm took over the food halls of the Littlewoods department store and also acquired the French Au Gel chain. This last move proved unsuccessful and the stores were dropped within a year.

Around 2000, the company attempted ties with British Home Stores. In May 2000, Iceland Foods merged with Booker plc, and Booker&#x27;s Stuart Rose took the role of CEO of the merged company. He left for the Arcadia Group in November 2000 and was replaced by Bill Grimsey in January 2001.
Soon after Grimsey&#x27;s appointment, Malcolm Walker, Iceland Foods&#x27;s founder and chairman, was forced to stand down, as it was revealed that he had sold £13.5 million of Iceland Foods shares just five weeks before the company released the first of several profits warnings.

Iceland Foods&#x27; holding company was renamed the Big Food Group in February 2002, and attempted a refocus on the convenience sector with a bid for Londis. Grimsey remained until the takeover and demerger of the Big Food Group by a consortium led by the Icelandic company Baugur Group in February 2005. Walker subsequently returned to his previous role at Iceland Foods. Iceland Foods&#x27;s website has a page critical of Grimsey&#x27;s period in control.

After Baugur collapsed in 2009, a 77% stake in the firm came into the ownership of the Icelandic banks Landsbanki and Glitnir. In 2012 the stake was purchased by a consortium including Malcolm Walker and Graham Kirkham.

After Walker&#x27;s return to the company, Iceland Foods reduced the workforce at the Deeside head office by 500, with approximately 300 jobs moved as a result of relocation of a distribution warehouse to Warrington.
In January 2009, Iceland Foods announced that it would buy 51 stores in the UK from the failed Woolworths Group chain, three days after the final 200 Woolworths stores closed their doors. In April 2009, Iceland Foods announced plans to close its appliance showrooms by September 2009 to concentrate on food retailing. Iceland Foods&#x27;s sales for the year ended 27 March 2009 were £2.08 billion, a 16% increase on the previous year, with net profits of £113.7 million. An additional Iceland Foods store opened in Dudley town centre on 2 December 2010 in part of the former Beatties department store, 21 years after their initial departure from the town.

In 2013, two labs, one in Ireland and another in Germany, on behalf of the Irish state agency FSAI, identified 0.1% equine DNA in some Iceland Foods products. Malcolm Walker caused controversy when on a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme (18 February 2013) he was asked why the products had passed British tests but failed the Irish ones. He replied, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s the Irish, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;.

In November 2013, the firm began selling appliances online again in partnership with DRL Limited. In May 2014, the firm reintroduced online shopping, which had been dropped in 2007.

In January 2018, Iceland Foods announced that it would end the use of plastic for all of its own-brand products by the end of 2023.

In 2019, Iceland Foods opened 45 new stores in the UK (including 31 larger stores under The Food Warehouse fascia) but had also closed eight, increasing the number of UK stores to 942. The company has a strategic alliance with The Range, where Iceland&#x27;s food offer has been introduced to nine of the home and garden retailer&#x27;s stores. In 2019 it also expanded its warehousing locations, adding five multi-temperature regional distribution centres at Livingston, Warrington, Deeside, Enfield and Swindon.

===Dispute over the trademark &quot;Iceland&quot;===

Iceland Foods Ltd has been accused by the government of Iceland of engaging in abusive behaviour by trademarking the name of the country, and of &quot;harass[ing] Icelandic companies and even the Icelandic tourism board&quot; by pursuing legal action against Icelandic companies which use the name of their country in their trading names. In November 2016, the Icelandic government filed a legal challenge at the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to have the company&#x27;s trademark invalidated &quot;on the basis that the term &#x27;Iceland&#x27; is exceptionally broad and ambiguous in definition, often rendering the country&#x27;s firms unable to describe their products as Icelandic&quot;. The &quot;Iceland Magazine&quot; noted that:
Iceland Foods was founded in 1970, but only acquired the Europe-wide trademark registration of &quot;Iceland&quot; in 2005. According to the Sagas Iceland, the nation was established in 874. It is an insult to common sense to maintain that the supermarket chain has a stronger claim to the trademark than the country.

In April 2019, The EUIPO invalidated the Iceland trademark.

==Domestic operations==
Iceland has over 900 stores in the UK.

In 2006, a policy of &quot;round sum pricing&quot; was introduced, with many products priced in multiples of 25p.

2006 also saw a surge in home delivery promotion, which is now one of the main focuses of the company. When a customer spends £25 or more whilst shopping in-store, they have the option of free next-day home delivery, choosing from available timeslots. Customers can also shop online and receive free next-day home delivery when they spend more than £40.

In October 2008, Iceland Foods launched the Bonus Card, a loyalty card and replacement for the original home delivery card. It allows customers to save money onto the card, with the firm putting £1 onto the card each time a customer saves £20, and gives occasional discounts, offers, and entry to competitions—including their main competition, in which each month one Bonus Card holder from every store wins the entire cost of their shop.

In 2014, Iceland launched The Food Warehouse, a brand name used for their superstores, which are typically sited in retail parks. As of 2021, there were 140 locations of The Food Warehouse.
In April 2021, Iceland launched Swift, their brand of convenience stores. Five stores were opened under the Swift brand, the first converted from a former Iceland store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the other four in the London area. Soon after introducing an Iceland Local format for petrol forecourt stores, Iceland announced in July 2023 that the Swift-branded stores would be scrapped, with four of the stores closed entirely, their staff transferred to other nearby Iceland stores, and one reformatted to the Iceland identity.

==European operations==
In 1996, Iceland opened its first store in Ireland. Later, there were seven stores, six in Dublin and one in Letterkenny. They all closed in 2005 owing to financial difficulties. In November 2008, Iceland Foods re-entered the Irish market, reopening a store in Ballyfermot in Dublin after agreeing a franchise deal with an Irish cash and carry company, AIM. In November 2009, a second Dublin store reopened in Finglas. In November 2013, Iceland Foods acquired seven Irish stores which were previously franchised.

In February 2023, Iceland&#x27;s parent company sold its 27 Irish stores to The Project Point Technologies, although the company was expected to continue to use the Iceland brand name under a franchise agreement. In June 2023, Metron Stores, trading as Iceland, was ordered to recall all imported meat products by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, due to traceability concerns. In the same month, Metron said it was insolvent and unable to pay debts of €36m, and several stores were abruptly closed. Iceland returned to the Republic of Ireland in October 2024 under a partnership with retailer Dunnes Stores.

There were 11 outlets in the Czech Republic, operated by ICL Czech until they closed in 2022.

Iceland Foods also operates stores in Spain and Portugal (countries with substantial British communities), in conjunction with Spanish-based retailer Overseas. The stores stock Iceland products as well as Waitrose items. In July 2012, in a joint venture with Jóhannes Jónsson, co-founder of Bónus and former Iceland owners Baugur Group, the firm opened a store in Kópavogur, Iceland, and subsequently in the capital, Reykjavík. Sandpiper CI has six Iceland Foods franchise supermarkets in Jersey and four in Guernsey.

Via franchise agreement with a local food importer and distributor, Iceland Foods operates in Malta. Initially, in 1998, this was for the supply only of Iceland Foods-branded products to supermarkets, but in 2015 the operation opened stores in Birkirkara, followed by Mosta, Qawra and Marsascala in 2018. The Malta stores differ from those in the UK: there is a greater emphasis on non-frozen items, and stores feature fresh fruit, vegetables and bakery sections.

==Advertising==
Iceland Foods historically advertised with the slogan &quot;Mums Love It&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Are we doing a deal or are we doing a deal?&quot; and &quot;Feel the deal&quot; in the early 2000s. From the mid-2000s ads featuring Kerry Katona saw a return to a slogan more traditionally associated with Iceland Foods – &quot;So that&#x27;s why mums go to Iceland!&quot; Katona was dropped as the face of Iceland Foods in 2009 after a tabloid newspaper published pictures allegedly showing her taking cocaine. She was succeeded by Coleen Nolan, Ellie Taylor, Stacey Solomon and Jason Donovan, who has also frequently appeared in the company&#x27;s Christmas advertisement campaigns. Peter Andre became face of the firm in 2014. The current main tagline is the truncated &quot;That&#x27;s why mums go to Iceland&quot;. Storefronts also bear the tagline &quot;food you can trust&quot;, and carrier bags in stores bear the tagline &quot;the frozen food experts&quot;. From May 2015, the TV adverts used the tagline and hashtag of &quot;Power Of Frozen&quot; which were fronted and voiced over by Andre. In 2024, a new advertising campaign was launched featuring TV personality Josie Gibson, and the new tagline &quot;That&#x27;s why we go to Iceland&quot;, which is described as a modern update of their original tagline.

When the chain bought rival Bejam in 1989, they launched the TV-advertising campaign &quot;Use Our Imagination,&quot; which included a song. The campaign was launched so quickly after the takeover that they had no time to convert all Bejam stores to the &quot;Iceland&quot; fascia. Therefore, the song for the commercial featured the line &quot;We&#x27;re at Bejam&#x27;s too...&quot;

In 2013, Iceland Foods stores appeared in a BBC documentary called &quot;Iceland Foods: Life in The Freezer Cabinet&quot;. The firm was the main sponsor of the ITV reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; from its sixth series in 2006 until its fourteenth series in 2014.

In 2018, Iceland announced they would end the use of palm oil in all their own brand products due to concern over environmental impact of palm oil. It was the first major UK supermarket to ban palm oil.

In January 2020/2021, Iceland Foods stores appeared in two Channel 5 series called &quot;Inside Iceland: Britain’s Budget Supermarket&quot;.

===2018 Rang-tan advert controversy and ban===

In November 2018, Iceland Foods submitted a version of an animated short starring a fictional orangutan named Rang-tan (originally released by Greenpeace) to Clearcast, but the submission was denied. Iceland Foods originally planned to utilise the short as the television advertisement that Christmas season, as an extension of their earlier palm oil reduction campaign.

<doc id="424605" wikidata="Q664321" url="?curid=424605" title="Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)">
<text>Futuna (; ) is the largest island in Hoorn Islands or Îles Horne, located in the Pacific Ocean, part of the French overseas collectivity (&quot;collectivité d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;) of Wallis and Futuna. The island occupies an area of and as of 2018 it has a population of 10,912. 

Futuna takes its name from an endonym derived from the local &quot;futu&quot;, meaning fish-poison tree.

==History==
Futuna and Alofi were first mapped by Europeans in 1616 by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire during their circumnavigation of the globe on the ship &quot;Eendracht&quot;. After sailing to Niuafoou, they suddenly changed course from west to northwest and discovered the two islands. The islands were named Hoorn Eylanden, after the city of Hoorn, Schouten&#x27;s birthplace. This became &quot;Horne&quot; in French and English. They also discovered a natural harbor along the southwest coast of Futuna, which they named Eendrachts baai (Unity Bay) after their ship. It is thought that their landing place was the site of the Anse de Sigave near what is today called Leava. 

Schouten and Le Maire had learned from earlier experiences how to approach islanders successfully. Upon landing, they went ashore, and, when approached by some of the natives, they made a show of force. This opened the way for a peaceful barter, with the natives offering coconuts, yams, and hogs in exchange for the sailors’ iron nails, beads and knives. The sailors went on to get fresh water and meet the king, who told his subjects that their guests were not to be disturbed by petty thieving. This way, the Dutch sailors were able to replenish their stocks without risk of theft. A few days after they arrived, the king of the other island, Alofi, came to visit, bringing with him 300 men. A feast was prepared and a kava ceremony and umu were organised. Schouten and Le Maire were likely the first Europeans to witness these ceremonies.

Without the risk of theft or hostilities, Schouten and Le Maire were able to study Futuna more thoroughly than had been possible for them in the case of the Niua islands. They did not visit Alofi. Their description of the islanders’ appearance and behavior was not flattering. Although they praise the men for being well-proportioned, they found the women ugly and ill-shaped, with breasts hanging down to their bellies like empty satchels. The people were said to all go naked, and to copulate in public, even in front of their king.

In the 19th century, whaling ships from the United States and elsewhere called at Futuna for water, wood, and food. The first one known to have called was the &quot;Independence&quot; in 1827.
==Geography==
Futuna and Alofi are both remnants of the same extinct volcano, now bordering with a fringing reef. Futuna&#x27;s highest point is Mont Puke at above sea level, and the island has an area of , with in Sigave and in Alo. It is separated from Wallis Island to the north by water deeper than in the Vitiaz Trench.

===Geology===
Futuna island has large Upper Pliocene volcanic lava flows, as well as breccias and hyaloclastite deposits from underwater eruptions.

===Tectonics===
Futuna is on the Futuna Ridge (Futuna–Alofi volcanic ridge) that lies along a boundary of interaction between the colliding Pacific and Australia plate, between the North Fiji transform fault to the south and the now inactive tectonically Vitiaz Trench. However the full tectonic role of the ridge and associated features is still not understood. As recently as March 2000 this ridge was discovered to be a spreading center extending over a distance of more than from the north of Fiji to the northwest of Futuna Island and a boundary of the Futuna plate which is a slightly ill defined microplate with triple junctions with the Pacific and Australian plates. The northern part of the ridge contains basaltic volcanoes such as Utu Uli that are younger than 780,000 years old and at depths of more than precluding exposive eruptions, so that their eruptions are effusive. There is a wide area of seafloor to the east of Futuna, with a WSW-ENE orientation, and with many volcanoes known as the South-East Futuna Volcanic Zone (SEFVZ). This contains the significant volcanoes of Ono, Tasi Tulo, Fatu Kapa and Kulo Lasi all south of the Vitiaz Trench. The young seafloor produced by these volcanoes in the SEFVZ means that the past tectonics is poorly understood as timings from say magnetic field changes cannot be obtained. The area is interacting with the spreading centers in the Lau Basin further to the east and southeast.

===Tsunami risk===
The island was affected by the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami with a run up height to and up to inland inundation. Studies afterwards revealed past tsunami events have occurred. 

===Climate===
Futuna (Maopoopo weather station) has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;). The average annual temperature in Maopoopo is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in February, at around , and lowest in August, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Maopoopo was on 10 January 2016; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 12 August 1980.
== Demographics ==
As of the 2018 census, the population of the island was 3,225, with 1,950 residing in the Alo district and 1,275 in Sigave. Futuna makes up approximately 27.9% of the population of Wallis and Futuna. The most spoken languages on Futuna are Futunan (94.5%), French (5.3%), and Wallisian (0.2%).

==Culture ==

Two kings, elected from the local nobility every few years, rule the population in conjunction with French authorities. They are the king of Sigave, the western province, and the king of Alo, the eastern province including Alofi. Except for Poi all villages are along the southwest coast, and they are from west to east: Toloke, Fiua, Vaisei, Nuku, and Leava (capital with the wharf) in Sigave, and Taoa, Malae, Ono, Kolia and Vele (at the airstrip) in Alo.

99% of the population of Wallis and Futuna are Catholic. Although the island is closer to Tonga and farther from Samoa than Uvea, the vernacular and culture are more Samoan.

Futuna is where Pierre Chanel was martyred in 1841, becoming Polynesia&#x27;s only Catholic saint. The cathedral of Poi now stands on the site where he was martyred.

==Education==
There are six primary schools on Futuna. The island also has two junior high schools (&quot;collèges&quot;): Fiua de Sigave and Sisia d&#x27;Ono. Residents are served by a senior high school/sixth-form college, Lycée d&#x27;Etat de Wallis et Futuna, on Wallis.

<text>Social Democracy (, SOCDEM), known as the Czech Social Democratic Party (, ČSSD) until 10 June 2023, is a social democratic political party in the Czech Republic. Sitting on the centre-left of the political spectrum and holding pro-European views, it is a member of the Party of European Socialists, the Socialist International, and the Progressive Alliance. Masaryk Democratic Academy is the party-affiliated&#x27;s think tank.

The ČSSD was a junior coalition party within Andrej Babiš&#x27; Second Cabinet&#x27;s minority government from June 2018, and was a senior coalition party from 1998 to 2006 and from 2013 to 2017. It held 15 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic following the 2017 Czech legislative election in which the party lost 35 seats. From 2018 to 2021, the party was led by Jan Hamáček, who has since been replaced by Michal Šmarda as leader after the 2021 Czech legislative election, in which the party lost all of its seats after falling below 5%.

== History ==

The Social Democratic Czechoslavonic party in Austria () was a political group founded on 7 April 1878 in Austria-Hungary as a regional wing of the Social Democratic Party of Austria. Founded in Břevnov atop earlier social democratic initiatives, such as the Ouls, it represented much of the Kingdom of Bohemia in the Austrian parliament, and its significant role in the political life of the empire was one of the factors that led to the creation of an independent Czechoslovakia. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, the party became one of the leading parties of the first Czechoslovak Republic. Its members were split over whether to join the Comintern, which in 1921 resulted in the fracturing of the party, with a large part of its membership then forming the new Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.
During the occupation of the Czech lands by Nazi Germany, the party was officially abolished, but its members organized resistance movements contrary to the laws of the German-controlled Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, both at home and abroad. After the re-establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1945, the party returned to its pre-war structure and became a member of the National Front which formed a new governing coalition. In 1948, after the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia gained a parliamentary majority, the Czech Social Democratic Party was incorporated into the Communist Party. At the time of the Prague Spring, a reformist movement in 1968, there were talks about allowing the recreation of a social democratic party, but Soviet intervention put an end to such ideas. It was only after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 that the party was recreated. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which came into effect on 1 January 1993, the ČSSD has been one of the major political parties of the Czech Republic, and until October 2017 was always one of the two parties with the largest number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

At the 1998 Czech legislative election, the party won the largest number of seats but failed to form a coalition government, so formed a minority government under its leader Miloš Zeman. With only 74 seats out of 200, the government had confidence and supply from the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), under the so-called Opposition Agreement. At the 2002 Czech legislative election, the party gained 70 of the 200 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic. Its leader Vladimír Špidla became prime minister, heading a coalition with two small centre-right parties, the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party (KDU–ČSL) and the Freedom Union – Democratic Union (US-DEU) until he was forced to resign in 2004 after the ČSSD lost in the 2004 European Parliament election in the Czech Republic.

The next leader was Stanislav Gross, serving as leader from 26 June 2004 to 26 April 2005 and as prime minister from 4 August 2004 to 25 April 2005. He resigned after a scandal when he was unable to explain the source of money used to buy his house. The successor of Gross as prime minister was Jiří Paroubek, while Bohuslav Sobotka became acting party leader from 26 April 2005 to 13 May 2006. Paroubek was then elected as the new party leader in the run-up to the 2006 Czech legislative election, at which the party won 32.3% of the vote and 74 out of 200 seats. The election at first caused a stalemate, since the centre-right parties plus the Green Party and the centre-left parties each had exactly 100 seats. The stalemate was broken when two ČSSD deputies, Miloš Melčák and Michal Pohanka, abstained during a vote of confidence, allowing a coalition of the Civic Democrats (ODS), the KDU-ČSL, and the Green Party to form a government, while the ČSSD went into opposition.
At the 2010 Czech legislative election, the ČSSD gained 22.08% of the vote but remained the largest party, with 56 seats. Failing to form a governing coalition, it remained in opposition to a government coalition of the ODS, conservative TOP 09 and conservative-liberal Public Affairs parties. Paroubek resigned as leader on 7 June and was succeeded by Sobotka. It remained the largest party after the 2013 Czech legislative election, and in December of the same year formed a governing coalition with the populist ANO 2011 and the centrist Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party. The leader of ČSSD, Bohuslav Sobotka, became the new Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.

The party suffered heavy losses in the 2017 Czech legislative election and was reduced to 15 seats, the worst result in its history. ČSSD suffered another defeat in the Prague Municipal, local and Senate elections in 2018. ČSSD lost 12 senators (only one managed to win re-election), all Prague deputies and more than half of their local councillors. In 2019 ČSSD lost all their representatives in the European Parliament. Some political commentators have interpreted the string of poor results as a sign of ČSSD losing their position in national politics. ČSSD suffered another defeat in 2020 Regional Elections and Senate elections, when they lost 10 senators (none re-elected) and 97 regional deputies. From 2018 to 2021, ČSSD had Jan Hamáček as First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Jana Maláčová as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Lubomír Zaorálek as Minister of Culture, and Miroslav Toman as Minister of Agriculture.

=== Extra-parliamentary party since 2021 ===
In the 2021 election the party fell short of the 5% threshold and subsequently lost all of its seats in the Chamber of Deputies. This came as a shock to much of the party membership, who were reportedly optimistic about party results even as predictions showed party losing its representation. Party chair Jan Hamáček resigned on the election day, as some high-ranking members blamed ANO for the lost.

Later that year, Mayor of the Nové Město na Moravě Michal Šmarda defeated former Minister of Labor Jana Maláčová in the leadership contest, vowing to return the party to Parliament. He also said he does not want to repeat the cooperation with ANO, as he reckoned that it will not exist when the next parliamentary election is held.

==== Relaunch ====
At its 2023, the party elected to change its name to just &quot;Social Democracy&quot;, and adopt a new visual identity with a new logo. Šmarda was reelected as chairman, claiming that the party will be an alternative to both a SPOLU-led government and an ANO-led opposition. He also says he sees the party back at a 30% vote share in four years and at 10% in the next parliamentary election, claiming that under his leadership, SOCDEM will not form a government with ANO, ODS, TOP 09, SPD or KSČM.

For the 2023 Czech presidential election, the party nominated a trade union leader Josef Středula, though he dropped out shortly before the election. Šmarda refused to support any other candidate, but called on his fellow party members to vote against Andrej Babiš, Jaroslav Bašta and Karel Diviš.

Former party leader Lubomír Zaorálek was selected as the party&#x27;s lead candidate for the 2024 European Parliament election. The party had chosen to run independently, after coalition talks with the Greens failed, but opted to invite Budoucnost members on its list. SOCDEM received 1.86% of the vote share at the election, failing to enter the European Parliament for the second consecutive time, and finishing 9th overall. Šmarda, describing the result as his personal failure, called for a new leadership election, blaming the party disunity for the result.

==== Under Jana Maláčova leadership ====
After the unsuccessful election, Jana Maláčová was elected chairwomen of the party, defeating former Minister for Human Rights Jiří Dienstbier Jr.. Maláčová called for the party to shift to the left and called for a Czech version of the French New Ecological and Social People&#x27;s Union alliance. Doing so, she refused to work with KSČM, causing a stir among some party members. Later, former ministers Jan Petříček, Petra Buzková and former party leader Jan Hamáček had left the party in protest.

Shortly after being elected, Maláčová began talks with the Stačilo! alliance, seeking cooperation for the 2025 Czech parliamentary election, citing the success of the French NUPES. This resulted in further protests from party members as well as the Young Social Democrats, which warned against another mass departure of members if SOCDEM collaborates with Stačilo!.

In February 2025, Maláčová announced that the talks have broken down, saying the Stačilo! was not &quot;not left-wing enough&quot; and that it focused on anti-system politics rather than on social-economical issues. The party has added that it is still open to cooperation with other subjects.

<doc id="424610" wikidata="Q4354479" url="?curid=424610" title="God in Mormonism">
<text>In orthodox Mormonism, the term God generally refers to the biblical God the Father, whom Latter Day Saints also refer to as Elohim or Heavenly Father, while the term Godhead refers to a council of three distinct divine persons consisting of God the Father, Jesus Christ (his firstborn Son, whom Latter Day Saints refer to as &quot;Jehovah&quot;), and the Holy Ghost. However, in Latter Day Saint theology the term God may also refer to, in some contexts, the Godhead as a whole or to each member individually.

Latter Day Saints believe that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three distinct beings, and that the Father and Jesus have perfected, glorified, physical bodies, while the Holy Ghost is a spirit without a physical body. Latter Day Saints also believe that there are other gods and goddesses outside the Godhead, such as a Heavenly Mother—who is married to God the Father—and that faithful Latter-day Saints may attain godhood in the afterlife. The term Heavenly Parents is used to refer collectively to the divine partnership of Heavenly Father and a Heavenly Mother. Joseph Smith taught that God was once a man on another planet before being exalted to Godhood.

This conception differs from the traditional Christian Trinity in several ways, one of which is that Mormonism has not adopted or continued to hold the doctrine of the Nicene Creed, that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are of the same substance or being. Also, Mormonism teaches that the intelligence dwelling in each human is coeternal with God. Mormons use the term &quot;omnipotent&quot; to describe God, and regard him as the creator: they understand him as being almighty and eternal but subject to eternal natural law which governs intelligence, justice and the eternal nature of matter (i.e. God organized the world but did not create it from nothing). The Mormon conception of God also differs substantially from the Jewish tradition of ethical monotheism in which &quot;Elohim&quot; (אֱלֹהִים) is a completely different conception.

This description of God represents the Mormon orthodoxy, formalized in 1915 based on earlier teachings. Other currently existing and historical branches of Mormonism have adopted different views of God, such as the Adam–God doctrine and Trinitarianism.

==Early Latter Day Saint concepts==
Most early Latter Day Saints came from a Protestant background, believing in the doctrine of Trinity that had been developed during the early centuries of Christianity. Before about 1835, Mormon theological teachings were similar to that established view. Founder Joseph Smith&#x27;s teachings regarding the nature of the Godhead changed during his lifetime, becoming most fully developed in the few years prior to his murder in 1844. Beginning as an unelaborated description of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being &quot;One&quot;, Smith taught that the Father and the Son were distinct personal members of the Godhead as early as 1832. Smith&#x27;s public teachings described the Father and Son as possessing distinct physical bodies, being one together with the Holy Ghost, not in material substance, but in spirit, glory, and purpose. Latter-day Saint scholar David L. Paulsen refers to this oneness as constituting &quot;one perfectly united, and mutually indwelling, divine community&quot;. Together with other Mormon and non-Mormon scholars such as Richard Bushman, Craig Blomberg, and Stephen H. Webb, they have described this oneness of the Godhead as social trinitarianism, while Mormon critic Robert M. Bowman Jr. prefers tritheism or &quot;ethical polytheism&quot;.

Mormons view their concept of the Godhead as a restoration of original Christian doctrine as taught by Christ and the Apostles. Mormons see the strong influence of Greek culture and philosophy (Hellenization) during this period as contributing to a departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian view of a corporeal God in whose image and likeness mankind was created. These theologians began to define God in terms of three persons, or &quot;hypostases&quot;, sharing one immaterial divine substance, or &quot;ousia&quot;—a concept that some claim found no backing in scripture, but closely mirrored elements of Greek philosophy such as Neoplatonism. 

===Teachings during Joseph Smith&#x27;s lifetime===
The Book of Mormon teaches that God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are &quot;one&quot;, with Jesus appearing with a body of spirit before his birth, and with a tangible body after his resurrection. The book describes the &quot;Spirit of the Lord&quot; &quot;in the form of a man&quot; and speaking as a man would.

Prior to the birth of Jesus, the book depicts him as a spirit &quot;without flesh and blood&quot;, with a spirit &quot;body&quot; that looked the same as he would appear during his physical life. Moreover, Jesus described himself as follows: &quot;Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.&quot; In another passage of the Book of Mormon, the prophet Abinadi states,

After Jesus was resurrected and ascended into heaven, the Book of Mormon states that he visited a group of people in the Americas, who saw that he had a resurrected, tangible body. During his visit, he was announced by the voice of God the Father, and those present felt the Holy Spirit, but only the Son was seen. Jesus is quoted as saying,

The Book of Mormon states that Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit are &quot;one&quot;. Some scholars have suggested that the view of Jesus in the Book of Mormon is also consistent, or perhaps &quot;most&quot; consistent, with monotheistic Modalism.

Even so, some historians have debated about Smith&#x27;s early conception of God. According to Boyd Kirkland and Thomas Alexander, in the early-to-mid-1830s Smith viewed God the Father as a spirit. However, Terryl Givens and Brian Hauglid argue that although Smith sometimes spoke of God using trinitarian language, revelations he dictated as early as 1830 described God as an embodied being. Catholic philosopher Stephen H. Webb describes Smith having had a &quot;corporeal and anthropomorphic understanding of God&quot; evinced in his 1830 Book of Moses that described God as a physical being who literally resembles human beings. Steven C. Harper states that because, in the 1830s, Smith privately described to some of his followers his 1820 first vision as a theophany of &quot;two divine, corporeal beings,&quot; &quot;its implications for the trinity and materiality of God were asserted that early&quot;.

In public sermons later in Smith&#x27;s life, he began to describe what he thought was the true nature of the Godhead in much greater detail. In 1843, Smith described both God the Father and God the Son as having distinct physical bodies and the Holy Spirit being a distinct yet incorporeal being, as well: &quot;The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man&#x27;s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.&quot; Although the verse is included in canonized LDS scripture, some dispute its authenticityparticularly that of the Holy Ghost dwelling in humans since the teaching was inconsistent with the manuscript source&#x27;s wording about the Holy Ghost and underwent various revisions and modifications before finalization.

During this period, Smith also introduced a theology that could support the existence of a Heavenly Mother. The primary source for this theology is the sermon he delivered at the funeral of King Follett (commonly called the King Follett Discourse). The LDS Church believes that a Heavenly Mother exists, but very little is acknowledged or known beyond her existence or the number of Heavenly Mothers as early LDS leaders did teach that it was &quot;clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives.&quot;

===Later teachings===
Lorenzo Snow succinctly summarized another portion of the doctrine explained in the King Follett Discourse using a couplet: &quot;As man now is, God once was: / As God now is, man may be.&quot;

==Denominational teachings==

===LDS Church===


The LDS Church holds that the Father and the Son have glorified physical bodies, while the Holy Ghost has only a body of spirit.

Leaders and scriptural texts of the LDS Church affirm a belief in the Holy Trinity but use the word &quot;Godhead&quot; (a term used by the Apostle Paul in Acts 17:29; Romans 1:20, and Colossians 2:9) to distinguish their belief that the unity of the Trinity relates to all attributes, except a physical unity of beings. Church members believe that &quot;The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man&#x27;s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.&quot;

This theology is consistent with Smith&#x27;s 1838 account of the First Vision. This account, published as part of the church&#x27;s Pearl of Great Price states that Smith saw a vision of &quot;two personages&quot;, the Father and the Son. Mormon critics view this 1838 account with skepticism, because Smith&#x27;s earliest accounts of the First Vision did not refer to the presence of two beings. The church also teaches that its theology is consistent with the Biblical account of the baptism of Jesus which referred to signs from the Father and the Holy Spirit, which the denomination interprets as an indication that these two persons have distinct substance from Jesus.

Smith taught that there is one Godhead and that humans can have a place, as joint-heirs with Christ, through grace, if they follow the laws and ordinances of the gospel. This process of exaltation means literally that humans can become full, complete, joint-heirs with Jesus and can, if proven worthy, inherit all that he inherits. Leaders have taught that God is infinitely loving, though his love &quot;cannot correctly be characterized as unconditional.&quot; Though humanity has the ability to become gods through the Atonement of Jesus, these exalted beings will remain eternally subject to God the Father and &quot;will always worship&quot; him. Among the resurrected, the righteous souls receive great glory and return to live with God, being made perfect through the atonement of Christ. Thus, &quot;god&quot; is a term for an inheritor of the highest kingdom of God.

===Community of Christ===
The Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, affirms the doctrine of the trinity. The trinity is described in Community of Christ as a &quot;living God who meets us in the testimony of Israel, is revealed in Jesus Christ, and moves through all creation as the Holy Spirit...[a] community of three persons.&quot; This belief is inconsistent with the earliest versions of the text of the Book of Mormon and the First Vision accounts.

==Plurality of gods==
Latter Day Saints believe God&#x27;s children have the potential to live in his presence, continue as families, become gods, create worlds, and have spirit children over which they will govern. This is commonly called exaltation within the LDS Church. Leaders have also taught that humans are &quot;gods in embryo&quot;. Although Mormonism proclaims the existence of many gods, it does not advocate for the worship of any besides Earth&#x27;s God. Some leaders have taught that God was once a mortal human with his own God. Church founder Joseph Smith taught in his famous King Follett discourse that God was the son of a Father, suggesting a cycle of gods that continues for eternity. Other more modern leaders and church publications have taught similar things.

<text>An augmented triad is a chord, made up of two major thirds (an augmented fifth). The term &quot;augmented triad&quot; arises from an augmented triad being considered a major chord whose top note (fifth) is raised. When using popular-music symbols, it is indicated by the symbol &quot;+&quot; or &quot;aug&quot;. For example, the augmented triad built on A, written as A+, has pitches A-C-E:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&#x27; { &lt;as c e&gt;1 } }
&lt;/score&gt;The chord can be represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 8}.

==Analysis==
Whereas a major triad, such as C–E–G, contains a major third (C–E) and a minor third (E–G), with the interval of the fifth (C–G) being perfect, the augmented triad has an augmented fifth, becoming C–E–G. In other words, the top note is raised a semitone. H.R. Palmer notes:

The augmented chord on I may contain the major seventh (I () or I ()), while the augmented chord on V may contain the minor seventh (V (), V (), or V ()). In C: C–E–G–B and G–B–D–F.

The augmented triad on the V may be used as a substitute dominant, and may also be considered as III+. The example below shows III+ as a substitute dominant in a ii-V-I turnaround in C major.&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\omit Score.TimeSignature
\relative c&#x27; {&lt;d f a c&gt;2 &lt;es g b&gt; &lt;c e g c&gt;1 \bar &quot;||&quot; } }
&lt;/score&gt;
See, for example, Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido &amp; Aeneas&quot;.
==In popular music==
Examples of popular music songs featuring the augmented chord include its use in the introduction of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;School Days&quot;, Aaron Neville&#x27;s &quot;Tell It Like It Is&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;, after intros in Gene Pitney&#x27;s &quot;Town Without Pity&quot;, The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;The Warmth of the Sun&quot;, Joe Cocker&#x27;s &quot;Delta Lady&quot;, at the end of the bridge in Patience and Prudence&#x27;s &quot;Tonight You Belong to Me&quot;, The Caravelles&#x27; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Baby to Cry&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;From Me to You&quot;, The Dave Clark Five&#x27;s &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, and Martha and the Vandellas&#x27; &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;. One of the few examples of an augmented chord on the opening downbeat is in the Carmen Lombardo song &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot;: in &quot;Barber Shop Memories, Book 2&quot; the 4-part vocal score for the song (in the key of F) uses B–D–F to harmonize the downbeat as IV+ (the enharmonic equivalent of VI+). An augmented chord also harmonizes the opening downbeat of the chorus of the 1908 song &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot;, heard at the beginning of the 1931 recording by Ruth Etting.Other examples of the augmented chord include its use as a chromatic passing function over the first degree, the rising to then harmonized as IV, as in Jay and the Americans&#x27; &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, Lesley Gore&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; (I – I+ – IV – iv) (see also minor major seventh chord), Herman&#x27;s Hermits&#x27; &quot;There&#x27;s a Kind of Hush&quot; (continues to 7 harmonized by Im7), by ii Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Crying&quot;, followed by 6 – 6 – 5 motion in &quot;Crying&quot;, The Guess Who&#x27;s &quot;Laughing&quot;, Dave Clark Five&#x27;s &quot;Because&quot; (verse: I – I+ – vi – Im7... ii and cadence on V+), The Monkees&#x27; &quot;Tapioca Tundra&quot; (I – I+ – vi, and V+ after bridge).

Though rare, the augmented chord occurs in rock music &quot;almost always as a linear embellishment linking an opening tonic chord with the next chord&quot;, for example John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot; and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;All My Loving&quot;. Thus, with an opening tonic chord, an augmented chord results from ascending or descending movement between the fifth and sixth degrees, such as in the chord progression I – I+ – vi. This progression forms the verse for Oasis&#x27;s 2005 single &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; (I – I+ – vi – IV)

==In classical music==
The augmented triad differs from the other kinds of triad (the major triad, the minor triad, and the diminished triad) in that it does not naturally arise in a diatonic scale. Although it could be conceptualized as a triad built on the third degree of a harmonic minor scale or melodic minor scale, it virtually never occurs in this way due to the harsh dissonance of the chord.

Striking examples of its use may be found in Mozart’s keyboard minuet K355. It first occurs as a passing chord on the third beat of bar 1 (D–G–B). However it comes into more striking prominence in the 6-bar sequential passage starting on the first beat of bar 5 (D-F–A):

According to Aubyn Raymar, in this minuet “flowing counterpoints woven among closely crowded chromaticisms and richly variegated harmony, sequential progressions in either direction coupled with unexpected dissonance… - such resources used with a mastery of concentration intensify the emotion which stirs within the brooding phrases of a perfectly balanced poem.” 

Its rarity makes the augmented triad a special chord that touches on the atonal. Its uses to &#x27;suspend&#x27; tonality are famous; for example, in Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Walzer&quot; (&quot;Fünf Klavierstücke&quot; Op. 23 No. 5). An earlier example may be found at the opening of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot;, where a sequence of augmented triads unfolds as arpeggios: 

However, the augmented triad occurs in tonal music, with a perfectly tonal meaning, since at least J.S. Bach. See the &quot;surprising&quot; first chord (D–F–B) in the opening chorus to his cantata &quot;Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2&quot;: . Other examples may be found in the work of Joseph Haydn. See, for example, bars 5-8 of the Trio from Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet Op. 54 No. 2: -also in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;: -and in Chopin’s stormy Prelude No. 24. The left hand piano arpeggios outline an augmented triad (D–F-A) in bars 47-50. The sudden change in dynamics from &quot;forte&quot; to a hushed &quot;piano&quot; in these bars highlights the emotional intensity of this passage: An augmented triad results diatonically in minor mode from a dominant chord where the fifth (the second degree) is replaced by the third degree, as an anticipation of the resolution chord. Johannes Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Tragic Overture&quot; also features the chord prominently (A–C–E), in alternation with the regular dominant (A–C–E). In this example one can also see other aspect of the appeal of the chord to composers: it is a &#x27;conflation&#x27; of the fifth degree and the third degree, the usual contrasting keys of a piece in the minor mode.

The &quot;whirl of the final bars&quot; of Mahler’s Symphony No. 7 features an abrupt interpolation of an augmented chord (E–G–C) in the penultimate bar, before the final chord of C major:

With the lead of Franz Schubert (in his &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot;), Romantic composers started organizing many pieces by descending major thirds, which can be seen as a large-scale application of the augmented triad (although it probably arose from other lines of development not necessarily connected to the augmented triad). This kind of organization is common; in addition to Schubert, it is found in music of Franz Liszt, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Louis Vierne and Richard Wagner, among others.

==Expressive and dramatic potential==
The striking sound of the augmented triad lends itself to effective word painting, especially when conveying strong emotion. The first song in Robert Schumann’s song cycle &quot;Frauen-Liebe und Leben&quot; uses the chord (F-B-D) on the second syllable of the word “empor” to convey the intensity of the singer’s feeling for her beloved:. In Purcell’s opera &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, on the other hand, the malign Sorceress planning Dido’s downfall sings the word “hate” to the accompaniment of an augmented chord (F–A–D) :

In J.S. Bach’s &quot;Magnificat&quot;, the composer sets the words “dispersit superbos mente cordis sui” (He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts) with a powerful chord sequence starting with an augmented triad (F–A-D) on the word “mente.” The passage is made all the more effective by being inititated by a sudden tempo change and a beat’s silence. This gives the chord considerable dramatic clout:

In the opening scene of Wagner’s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, one of the three Norns conveys her dread and uncertainty about what is going to pass. “Sing, sister, wind the rope of fate.” The underlying orchestral accompaniment contains ominous augmented chords of “ambiguous tonality.”:

==Tuning==
In just intonation, the interval between two major thirds and an octave, 2:(5:4)2, is 32:25, which is flatter by a septimal kleisma of size 225:224 than the septimal major third with ratio 9:7. While septimal meantone temperament tempers out the septimal kleisma, some other temperaments, for example miracle temperament, do so also, and in all of these temperaments the augmented triad may be identified with a circle of two major and one septimal major thirds, making up an octave.

<text>KDU-ČSL (In Czech, the initials of the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party; ), often shortened to (&quot;the populars&quot;), is a Christian democratic political party in the Czech Republic. The party has taken part in almost every Czech government since 1990. In the June 2006 legislative election, KDU-ČSL won 7.2% of the vote and 13 out of 200 seats. However, in the 2010 election, its vote share dropped to 4.4% and they lost all of its seats. The party regained its parliamentary standing in the 2013 legislative election, winning 14 seats in the new parliament, thus becoming the first party ever to return to the Chamber of Deputies after previously dropping out.

==History==
After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Šrámek served as head of Czechoslovak government in exile (in the United Kingdom). After 1945, ČSL was part of the national unity government, forming its most right-wing section.

On 12 April 2017, KDU-ČSL signed an agreement with STAN to participate in 2017 legislative election as a coalition. Coalition needed to get more 10% of votes get over threshold. The coalition disintegrated before the election, thus the party went into the elections standalone, receiving 5.8% of votes.

In March 2019 the party was officially renamed to KDU-ČSL, its common abbreviation and Marek Výborný became a new party leader. After the death of his wife announced Marek Výborný in November 2019 his resignation for personal reasons.

===Membership===
KDU-ČSL had 27,662 Members in 2015 which is the second largest member base of any party in the Czech Republic. The number has been decreasing since the 1990s when the party had 100,000 Members. It is caused by high average age of members.

===Party strongholds===
KDU-ČSL is known to have very strong electoral core concentrated primarily in South Moravia. The party has very stable electoral support thanks to the rural voters in Moravia and has managed to gain seats in the Chamber of Deputies during every election cycle in the Czech Republic since 1990 with the exception of 2010.

<doc id="424615" wikidata="Q1807830" url="?curid=424615" title="Civic Democratic Alliance">
<text>The Civic Democratic Alliance (, ODA) was a conservative-liberal political party in the Czech Republic, active between 1989 (founded shortly after the Velvet revolution) and 2007. The ODA was part of government coalitions until 1997 and participated in transformation of the Czech economy. The party was supported by president Václav Havel who voted for it in 1992 and 1996 election.

==History==
The ODA was established in 1989 by a group of intellectuals as a conservative-liberal party, based on ideas often expressed in The Salisbury Review. The other motive was personal antipathy to Václav Klaus and his party Civic Democratic Party (ODS).

In 1992 legislative election, ODA obtained over 300,000 votes (5,93 per cent of all votes) and gained 14 seats in Czech National Council. It became part of right-wing coalition (First government of Václav Klaus) together with the ODS, Christian and Democratic Union (KDU–ČSL) and Christian Democratic Party (KDS).

In 1996 legislative election, the ODA obtained 6.36 per cent of votes and again formed coalition with the ODS and KDU–ČSL (the second government of Václav Klaus). However, this government didn&#x27;t manage to form majority in the Chamber of Deputies and so was depending on toleration of the centre-left Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) (government disposed of 99 deputies out of 200, social democrats of 61 deputies and non-system parties of 40 deputies). Following financial scandals of the ODS, the coalition fell apart. Both the ODS and KDU-ČSL participated in caretaker government of Josef Tošovský.

It didn&#x27;t participate in 1998 legislative election, in order &quot;to not split votes on the right-wing&quot;. The ODA formed the Four-Coalition with the KDU–ČSL, Freedom Union and Democratic Union in opposition to the grand coalition of the centre-right ODS and centre-left ČSSD. However, the ODA became the coalition&#x27;s weakest member, and after its funding problems came to light, it ceased to take part in the Czech political scene. It only had one senator, Karel Schwarzenberg (Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic since 2007). The party ceased activity on 31 December 2007.

Czech billionaire Pavel Sehnal announced in December 2016 that he established a new Civic Democratic Alliance. Leaders of the original ODA weren&#x27;t involved with the new party.

<doc id="424617" wikidata="Q392095" url="?curid=424617" title="Onion routing">
<text>Onion routing is a technique for anonymous communication over a computer network. In an onion network, messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to the layers of an onion. The encrypted data is transmitted through a series of network nodes called &quot;onion routers,&quot; each of which &quot;peels&quot; away a single layer, revealing the data&#x27;s next destination. When the final layer is decrypted, the message arrives at its destination. The sender remains anonymous because each intermediary knows only the location of the immediately preceding and following nodes. While onion routing provides a high level of security and anonymity, there are methods to break the anonymity of this technique, such as timing analysis.

== History ==
Onion routing was developed in the mid-1990s at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory by employees Paul Syverson, Michael G. Reed, and David Goldschlag to protect U.S. intelligence communications online. It was then refined by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and patented by the Navy in 1998.

This method was publicly released by the same employees through publishing an article in the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications the same year. It depicted the use of the method to protect the user from the network and outside observers who eavesdrop and conduct traffic analysis attacks. The most important part of this research is the configurations and applications of onion routing on the existing e-services, such as Virtual private network, Web-browsing, Email, Remote login, and Electronic cash.

Based on the existing onion routing technology, computer scientists Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson joined Paul Syverson in 2002 to develop what has become the largest and best-known implementation of onion routing, then called The Onion Routing project (Tor project).

After the Naval Research Laboratory released the code for Tor under a free license, Dingledine, Mathewson and five others founded The Tor Project as a non-profit organization in 2006, with the financial support of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and several other organizations.

== Data structure ==

Metaphorically, an onion is the data structure formed by &quot;wrapping&quot; a message with successive layers of encryption to be decrypted (&quot;peeled&quot; or &quot;unwrapped&quot;) by as many intermediary computers as there are layers before arriving at its destination. The original message remains hidden as it is transferred from one node to the next, and no intermediary knows both the origin and final destination of the data, allowing the sender to remain anonymous.

=== Onion creation and transmission ===

To create and transmit an onion, the originator selects a set of nodes from a list provided by a &quot;directory node&quot;. The chosen nodes are arranged into a path, called a &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;circuit&quot;, through which the message will be transmitted. To preserve the anonymity of the sender, no node in the circuit is able to tell whether the node before it is the originator or another intermediary like itself. Likewise, no node in the circuit is able to tell how many other nodes are in the circuit and only the final node, the &quot;exit node&quot;, is able to determine its own location in the chain.

Using asymmetric key cryptography, the originator obtains a public key from the directory node to send an encrypted message to the first (&quot;entry&quot;) node, establishing a connection and a shared secret (&quot;session key&quot;). Using the established encrypted link to the entry node, the originator can then relay a message through the first node to a second node in the chain using encryption that only the second node, and not the first, can decrypt. When the second node receives the message, it establishes a connection with the first node. While this extends the encrypted link from the originator, the second node cannot determine whether the first node is the originator or just another node in the circuit. The originator can then send a message through the first and second nodes to a third node, encrypted such that only the third node is able to decrypt it. The third, as with the second, becomes linked to the originator but connects only with the second. This process can be repeated to build larger and larger chains but is typically limited to preserve performance.

When the chain is complete, the originator can send data over the Internet anonymously. When the final recipient of the data sends data back, the intermediary nodes maintain the same link back to the originator, with data again layered, but in reverse such that the final node this time adds the first layer of encryption and the first node adds the last layer of encryption before sending the data, for example a web page, to the originator, who is able to decrypt all layers.

== Weaknesses ==
=== Timing analysis ===

One of the reasons why the typical Internet connections are not considered anonymous is the ability of Internet service providers to trace and log connections between computers. For example, when a person accesses a particular website, the data itself may be secured through a connection like HTTPS such that the user&#x27;s password, emails, or other content is not visible to an outside party, but there is a record of the connection itself, what time it occurred, and the amount of data transferred. Onion routing creates and obscures a path between two computers such that there is no discernible connection directly from a person to a website, but there still exist records of connections between computers. Traffic analysis searches those records of connections made by a potential originator and tries to match the timing and data transfers to connections made to a potential recipient. If an attacker has compromised both ends of a route, a sender may be seen to have transferred an amount of data to an unknown computer a specified amount of seconds before a different unknown computer transferred data of the same exact size to a particular destination. Factors that may facilitate traffic analysis include nodes failing or leaving the network and a compromised node keeping track of a session as it occurs when chains are periodically rebuilt.

Garlic routing is a variant of onion routing associated with the I2P network that encrypts multiple messages together, which both increases the speed of data transfer and makes it more difficult for attackers to perform traffic analysis.

===Exit node vulnerability===
Although the message being sent is transmitted inside several layers of encryption, the job of the exit node, as the final node in the chain, is to decrypt the final layer and deliver the message to the recipient. A compromised exit node is thus able to acquire the raw data being transmitted, potentially including passwords, private messages, bank account numbers, and other forms of personal information. Dan Egerstad, a Swedish researcher, used such an attack to collect the passwords of over 100 email accounts related to foreign embassies.

Exit node vulnerabilities are similar to those on unsecured wireless networks, where the data being transmitted by a user on the network may be intercepted by another user or by the router operator. Both issues are solved by using a secure end-to-end connection like SSL/TLS or secure HTTP (S-HTTP). If there is end-to-end encryption between the sender and the recipient, and the sender isn&#x27;t lured into trusting a false SSL certificate offered by the exit node, then not even the last intermediary can view the original message.

<text>The Civic Democratic Party (, ODS) is a conservative and economically liberal political party in the Czech Republic. The party sits between centre-right and right-wing on the political spectrum, and holds 34 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and is the second strongest party by number of seats following the 2021 election. It is the only political party in the Czech Republic that has maintained an uninterrupted representation in the Chamber of Deputies.

Founded in 1991 as the pro–free market wing of the Civic Forum by Václav Klaus and modeled on the British Conservative Party, the ODS won the 1992 legislative election, and has remained in government for most of the Czech Republic&#x27;s independence. In every legislative election (except for that of 2013) it emerged as one of the two strongest parties. Václav Klaus served as the first prime minister of the Czech Republic after the partition of Czechoslovakia, from 1993 to 1997. Mirek Topolánek, who succeeded him as leader of the party in December 2002, served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009. In the 2010 election, the party lost 28 seats, finishing second, but as the largest party right of the centre, it formed a centre-right government with Petr Nečas as prime minister. In the 2013 legislative election, the party was marginalized by only securing 16 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, relegating the party to the opposition from July 2013 to December 2021. In the 2017 legislative election, it has partly recovered and secured 25 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, making it the second strongest party in chamber. The party is currently being led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, who has been leader since the 2014 party convention.

The ODS is a member of the International Democracy Union, and co-founded together with the UK Conservative Party, the soft Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists Party and the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament.

==History==
===Formation===
The party was founded in 1991 as one of two successors to the Civic Forum, which was a big tent movement that consisted of two major wings. The strongest wing was the Interparliamentary Club of the Democratic Right which was transformed into the ODS when Civic Forum split. ODS represented followers of Václav Klaus and was pro–free market, as opposed to the centrist Civic Movement. An agreement was reached to split the party in half at the Civic Forum Assembly on 23 February 1991. This was followed on 21 April by a formal declaration of a new party, and Klaus was elected its first President. The party agreed to continue in a coalition government with the Civic Movement, but this collapsed in July 1991.

The Civic Democrats, who represented demands for a tighter Czechoslovak federation, began to organize in Slovakia. Ahead of the 1992 election, the ODS ruled out an electoral alliance with the Liberal Democrats, but agreed to an alliance with Václav Benda&#x27;s Christian Democratic Party (KDS) to boost its appeal to conservatives. The ODS won the election, winning 66 seats (and the KDS another ten), and formed a centre-right coalition with the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the KDU-ČSL, with Klaus as prime minister.

===Dominant party (1992–1998)===
In December 1997, allegations of the party receiving illegal donations and maintaining a secret slush fund caused the ODA and KDU-ČSL to withdraw from the coalition, and the government collapsed. Josef Tošovský was appointed caretaker, pending new elections in June 1998. Despite the scandal, Klaus was re-elected party chairman. In January 1998, some legislators opposed to Klaus, led by Jan Ruml and Ivan Pilip, left the party in the so-called &#x27;Sarajevo Assassination&#x27; and formed the Freedom Union (US).

===First Opposition===
At the elections, the ODS fell even further, to 63 seats, while the US won 19. Due to the split, the Freedom Union refused to support the ODS, preventing them from getting a majority; the US&#x27;s executive also refused to support the ČSSD. As a result, on 9 July 1998, the ODS signed the Opposition Agreement, which pledged the party to provide confidence and maintain a ČSSD government under Miloš Zeman. This agreement was then superseded by the more explicit &#x27;Patent of Tolerance&#x27; in January 2000.

===Return to government (2006–2013)===

In the 2006 legislative election the ODS was the largest seat holder in the Chamber of Deputies with 81 seats. ODS originally aimed to make a deal with Czech Social Democratic Party but talks with the Social democratic leader Jiří Paroubek were unsuccessful. Mirek Topolánek then introduced his first minority cabinet that consisted of Civic Democrats and independents. It was designated on 4 September 2006 but lost a vote of confidence on 3 October 2006.

ODS then formed a government in coalition with the Populars (KDU-ČSL) and the Green Party (SZ). Projects of the cabinet included reform of public finances. Topolánek also discussed possible emplacement of United States Missile defense in the Czech Republic which resulted in public resistance.

The party suffered heavy losses in regional and Senate elections in 2008, losing all 12 regional governorships it had previously held. However, a year later, ODS won the European Parliament election, keeping all 9 seats and gaining more votes than in previous elections.

ODS-led government during Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union 2009. Czech presidency had to deal with problems such as Gas crisis in Ukraine, conflict in Gaza or economic crisis. There were also controversies like Entropa but some aspects such as resolution of gas crisis were positively evaluated.
ODS nominated Přemysl Sobotka for president of the Czech Republic during the 2013 presidential election. Sobotka received only 2.46% of votes and didn&#x27;t qualify for second round. ODS has held 2012 presidential primaries which Přemysl Sobotka has won. Sobotka&#x27;s poor showing in the 2013 general election was seen as caused by the government&#x27;s unpopularity and lack of support from the party. The party&#x27;s leadership supported Karel Schwarzenberg of TOP 09 in the second round of the presidential election.

===Second Opposition (2013–2017)===
After resignation and fall of Cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas ODS proposed Miroslava Němcová to the position of the prime minister to President Miloš Zeman saying that she will be able to form a coalition and succeed a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies. However, President Zeman refused to appoint her and instead appointed Jiří Rusnok&#x27;s Cabinet. After that, opposition called for a dissolution of Chamber of Deputies and early election (such vote was only recently made possible by a constitutional amendment). The motion of dissolution passed with 147 out of 200 votes (120 required), all parties except ODS, whose deputies left the chamber, voted for dissolution, including their former coalition partners Public Affairs and TOP 09. President Zeman then called on early elections on 25–26 October 2013. ODS suffered heavy losses. It gained only 16 seats and finished 5th. The party also lost elections of the European parliament as well as Senate and municipal in 2014.

As of December 2015, opinion polls showed ODS with 8.6% nationwide. Some polling agencies and political commentators are of the opinion that ODS was on the path to become main centre-right party again.

On 16 January 2016, Fiala was re-elected as Leader of the ODS. ODS participated in 2016 regional and Senate election. It received about 10% of votes and its candidate&#x27;s secured seats in all regions. Six candidates nominated by ODS qualified for the second round for Senate, while four of them were eventually elected. Fiala said that ODS returned to the position of the major right wing party.

===Opposition and formal cooperation with TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL (2017–2021)===
ODS agreed to participate in the 2017 legislative election together with Freeholder party. Parties will present themselves during the campaign as &quot;ODS with the support of Freeholders&quot;. This agreement means that Freeholders will take 40 places on ODS candidacy list. In February 2017, ODS started a campaign called &quot;We create program.&quot; which was series of tours to Czech regions with party leaders discussing priorities with supporters and potential voters for an upcoming election. On 19 April 2017, ODS introduced its tax program. The Civic Democrats want to lower taxes which they say would increase the income of Czech citizens. ODS also wants to decrease spending in social benefits and subsidies. Chief Whip Zbyněk Stanjura said that many people take advantage of social benefits even though they don&#x27;t deserve it. These plans resembled those that ODS had in the 2006 legislative election manifesto. Tours concluded with Conference &quot;Strong program for Strong Czechia&quot; held on 22 April where ODS presented their election manifesto and candidates.
Following the 2017 Czech government crisis, ODS grew in polls, approaching the Czech Social Democratic Party. According to a poll by TNS Kantar, ODS would become the second strongest party, surpassing ČSSD and KSČM. ODS introduced its campaign for 2017 election on 29 May 2017. It is inspired by the British Conservative Party&#x27;s campaign for 2017 general election. In the 2017 election, ODS sought to get more than 10%. According to poll by STEM/Mark in September. ODS would get 7.5% of votes.

ODS received 11% in 2017 legislative election and became the second largest political party in the Czech Republic. The party then won 2018 Senate election confirming its position as the main right wing party.

Civic Democratic Party, KDU-ČSL and TOP 09 formed bloc of conservative opposition parties in late 2020. The alliance was known as the &quot;Three Coalition&quot;, before the parties launched their slogan and program on 9 December 2020, announcing that they would run under the name Spolu (&quot;together&quot;) in the 2021 Czech legislative election. The conservative bloc announced that Petr Fiala would be their candidate for the post of prime minister.

The Bloc ran in 2021 Czech legislative election with Fiala as a leader. Opinion polls suggested that ANO 2011 would win the election but in an electoral upset ODS-led Spolu won highest number of votes and opposition parties won majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Opposition parties signed memorandum agreeing to nominate ODS leader Fiala for the position of the new prime minister.

===Return to power (2021–present)===
ODS formed a coalition government with STAN, KDU-ČSL, TOP 09, and Piráti after the election. Petr Fiala became the new prime minister. ODS holds six seats in Fiala&#x27;s Cabinet.

==Ideology==
The ODS is described as conservative, liberal-conservative, and conservative-liberal, supports economic liberalism, and is Eurosceptic. There are also multiple ideological factions in the party, including the national conservative faction, the national liberal faction, the social liberal faction the neoconservative faction and the Christian socially conservative faction (former Christian Democratic Party).
The party&#x27;s ideas are very close to those of the British Conservative Party, Swedish Moderate Party, and other liberal-conservative parties in Europe. The party&#x27;s program states &quot;low taxes, public finances and future without debts, support for families with children, addressable social system, reducing bureaucracy, better conditions for business, a safe state with the transatlantic links. No tricks and populism.&quot;

Many prominent politicians in the party say they are opposed to &quot;political correctness&quot; and call for tougher measures to combat radical Islam which they liken to Nazism.
Although the party was in power when the Treaty of Lisbon was ratified in the Czech Republic, ODS supports maintaining Czech sovereignty and integrity against the European Union, calls for a fundamental reform of the EU and strongly opposes any federalization of Europe in the form of the EU becoming a quasi-state entity. Following the EU referendum in Britain which resulted in the United Kingdom voting to leave, ODS leader Petr Fiala said the Czech Republic &quot;should reconsider its priorities and strategy in the European Union&quot; and if the Treaties were to be re-opened, negotiate new conditions for the country such as an opt-out from asylum rules as well as from the obligation to adopt the euro. The party is a member of the national-conservative European Conservatives and Reformists group.

ODS is opposed to compulsory EU migrant quotas, arguing that the Czech Republic should have sovereignty over its own border control and that forcing nations to take in migrants without sufficient vetting or orderly processing and integration poses a threat to national security, social cohesion and native European culture. ODS believes that all individual nations should have the right to determine their own immigration policies.

ODS also supports the right of law abiding citizens to own and carry firearms. This makes them different from parties they are based on, as most of them, especially British Conservatives, reject the idea that anyone has a right to own and carry firearms and other weapons. This makes the ODS much more similar to American Republicans in this matter. However, the ODS still supports gun control measures (such as background checks, licenses and registration). ODS, especially its defense expert Jana Černochová, was one of the main supporters of embedding the right to keep and bear arms for the purposes of national security into the Czech constitution, although it was Social Democrat Milan Chovanec who originally proposed it. The amendment failed in the Senate. In 2021, a similar bill passed.

==Symbols==
===Name===
Václav Klaus stated that the party&#x27;s name represents the fact that ODS is based on the idea of civic freedoms. It also shows that ODS is a Civic Party, which differentiates it from other parties that existed prior to 1991. The adjective Democratic represents that ODS should protect parliamentary democracy.

Besides its official name, ODS also received some informal names from media. Party members are sometimes called &quot;the Blues&quot; or the &quot;Blue Birds&quot; and ODS is sometimes called the &quot;Blue Party&quot; due to the party&#x27;s association with the color blue.

===Logo===
The first logo was introduced on 4 June 1991, created by Aleš Krejča. It was chosen from over 250 entries to a public competition.

A new logo was introduced in 1992, including the silhouette of a bird in blue. The logo was created by Petr Šejdl. In 1994 when the bird&#x27;s tail was shortened and in 1998 the font was changed as a result of the &quot;Sarajevo betrayal&quot; of autumn 1997, in which ODS colleagues used allegations of bribery to precipitate the resignation of Václav Klaus&#x27; government while he was on a trip to Sarajevo. The party used this version until 2015 with modifications for individual election campaigns.

The ODS introduced a new party logo in a congress in Prague in 2015. The design of the bird was updated and flies upwards rather than to the left. The logo was designed by Libor Jelínek.
==Organisation==
===Party structure===
The highest body of the ODS is Congress which meets every year and elects leadership every two years. The party is led by the Executive Council and Republic Assembly in time between meetings of Congress. The executive body meets every Month and the party is led by Panel between meetings of the Executive Council. Panel consists of Party&#x27;s Leader, Deputy Leaders and Chief Whips of the Parliamentary ODS.

ODS is structured similarly to the subdivisions of the Czech Republic. The structure consists of local associations. Group of local associations forms area. Areas are organised as parts of Region.

===Membership===
ODS had 18,500 Members in 1991. The number of members grew with the party&#x27;s influence and soon rose to over 23,000. It decreased during political crisis in 1998 to 16,000. The party stopped the decrease after preliminary election and membership grew once again. It peaked in 2010 when it reached 31,011. The member base started to decline rapidly after 2010. It had only 17,994 members prior the 2013 election. ODS had 14,771 members in May 2015 and the member base was stabilised according to leaders of the party.
The party runs a membership organisation known as Supporters of ODS. It is a looser form of involvement with the party. It is meant for people who doesn&#x27;t want to be members of ODS but sympathize with its program. It replaced the organisation known as Blue Team.

Faces of ODS is a project of party&#x27;s members who share their life&#x27;s story. It was described as honour for all members of the party who didn&#x27;t abandon it in hard times.

===Young Conservatives===

Young Conservatives (, MK) is a youth wing of ODS. Young people from the age of 15 to 35 can apply for a membership in the MK. The founding congress of MK was held on 8 December 1991 as a result of previous preparations through Charter of Young Conservatives by a group of students at the University of Technology in Brno and Law Students&#x27; Association &quot;Všehrd&quot; from Faculty of Law at the Charles University. The Young Conservatives organize a wide range of events from meetings with local or national politicians to elections campaigns and international events.

=== CEVRO Liberal Conservative Academy ===

CEVRO Liberal Conservative Academy () is a think-tank affiliated with ODS. It was established in 1999. Its goal is political education which tries to spread liberal-conservative thinking. In 2005, CEVRO established its own private university known as CEVRO Institute. CEVRO has four newspapers – &quot;CEVRO Revue&quot;, &quot;The Week in European Politics&quot;, &quot;The Week in Czech Politics&quot; and &quot;Forthnightly&quot;.

===International organisations===
ODS joined the European Democrat Union (EDU) in 1992 as one of the first parties in the former Eastern Bloc. Václav Klaus even became a Vice President of EDU. ODS remained in the EDU until it became part of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) in 2002. ODS refused to join EPP due to its ideological differences and instead became a member of European Democrats.

ODS joined International Democracy Union (IDU) in 2001. Chairmen of Civic Democratic Party served as Vice-presidents of IDU.

In July 2006, the Civic Democratic Party signed an agreement with the British Conservative Party to leave the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats (EPP-ED) Group in the European Parliament and form the Movement for European Reform in 2009. On 22 June 2009, it was announced that ODS would join the newly formed European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) parliamentary group, an anti-federalist and Eurosceptic group, which currently its third largest bloc in the European Parliament. ODS then became one of founding members of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR Party), a conservative and Eurosceptic European political party, defending broader conservative and economically liberal principles. Other members of ECR Party include Conservative Party, Law and Justice or Freedom and Solidarity.

<text>The Freedom Union–Democratic Union (, US–DEU) was a small pro-European liberal political party in the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2011.

The Freedom Union was founded in January 1998 by former members of the Civic Democratic Party who were unhappy with the leadership of Václav Klaus. After initially serving in a caretaker government, Freedom Union went into opposition after the 1998 election. In opposition, Freedom Union merged with the Democratic Union, and formed an alliance with the Christian Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party (KDU-ČSL).

From 2002 to 2006 Freedom Union was part of a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party and KDU-ČSL. However, in government the party lost support and at the 2006 election the party won less than 1% of the vote and failed to win any seats. The party disbanded on 1 January 2011.

==History==

===Founding===
The party was founded on 17 January 1998 at a congress in Litomyšl as the Freedom Union (), as a split from the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). The party was founded after divisions within ODS over the leadership of Václav Klaus, and what the defectors said was his failure to tackle funding scandals. The former interior minister Jan Ruml led a challenge for the ODS leadership, but was defeated by Klaus by 227 votes to 72 at a special congress on 14 December 1997. This prompted 30 ODS members of parliament to form the Freedom Union, including Finance Minister Ivan Pilip and Defence Minister Michal Lobkowicz. The party elected Jan Ruml as its first leader on 2 February 1998.

Pilip and Lobkowicz were among the members of the Freedom Union who served in the caretaker government of Josef Tošovský, formed after the collapse of the coalition led by Václav Klaus. The party initially attracted public support, with a poll in March 1998 showing the Freedom Union on 13%, ahead of ODS on 8%. However the party suffered in the campaign for the June 1998 election, due to a lack of readiness for an election and a vague programme that was seen as being very similar to that of ODS.

===Opposition===
At the 1998 election the Freedom Union won 8.6% of the vote and 19 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Refusing to form a government with ODS led by Václav Klaus, or with the Social Democratic Party due to policy differences, the party went into opposition. Instead the Social Democrats formed a minority government, which was tolerated by ODS.

In September 1998, the Freedom Union formed an alliance called the &quot;Four-Coalition&quot; with three other centre-right parties: KDU-ČSL, the Democratic Union, and the Civic Democratic Alliance. The Four-Coalition went on to win the most seats in the November 1998 Senate election. Ruml resigned as leader in December 1999, and the following February the party elected Karel Kühnl as the new leader, with 193 votes compared to 87 for Vladimír Mlynář.

The Freedom Union performed strongly at the November 2000 Senate election, becoming the third largest party in the Senate. In late 2001, Freedom Union merged with the Democratic Union party to form the Freedom Union-Democratic Union (US-DEU). However the Four-Coalition split at the beginning of 2002, after a lack of agreement on how to manage the high level of debts held by the Civic Democratic Alliance. Freedom Union-Democratic Union instead formed an alliance with KDU-ČSL to fight the 2002 election as the &quot;Coalition&quot;.

===Government===
At the 2002 election the coalition of the Freedom Union-Democratic Union and KDU-ČSL won 31 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and subsequently became part of a coalition government led by the Czech Social Democratic Party, which had a majority of one seat. However, at the 2002 Senate election, the Freedom Union-Democratic Union was reduced to only one senator.

As a party of government, the party started losing members and support, and suffered defeat in the 2004 European Parliament elections, failing to pass the 5% threshold required to win seats. Party leader Petr Mares resigned as a result, and was succeeded by the Regional Development Minister Pavel Němec. The party won just one seat at the 2004 Senate election.

===Decline and dissolution===
At the 2006 election, the party received just 0.3% of the vote, and lost all its seats in the Chamber of Deputies, triggering the resignation of its leader, Pavel Němec. 

The party held a final party conference on 4 December 2010, where it was decided to disband the party as of 1 January 2011.

==Policies==
The Freedom Union-Democratic Union was a centre-right liberal party, which promoted free market policies and supported lower taxes and university tuition fees. The party was also a consistent critic of corruption.

However the party was also socially liberal, supporting the protection of the environment and minority rights. For the 2006 election, the party called for the legalisation of euthanasia, same-sex marriage and marijuana. The party was also pro-European and supported direct presidential elections.

Support for the party was mostly among younger urban voters and those with higher education.

<doc id="424620" wikidata="Q16983067" url="?curid=424620" title="New York Central Mohawk">
<text>The New York Central Railroad (NYC) called the 4-8-2 type of steam locomotive the Mohawk type. It was known as the &quot;Mountain&quot; type on other roads, but the New York Central did not see the name as fitting on its famous Water Level Route. Instead, it picked the name of one of those rivers its rails followed, the Mohawk River, to name its newest type of locomotive.

The L1s and L2s were unstable at higher speeds due to the lack of effective cross-balancing, making the 4-wheel leading truck simply a better distributor of their weight; the L1s and L2s were consequently limited to , though this issue was resolved for the L3s and L4s using data gathered from two experimental L-2s.

The New York Central became the largest 4-8-2 user in North America, with 600 locomotives of this type built for its service; only the Pennsylvania Railroad came close, with 301 M1&#x27;s of the type.

The Mohawk type was the pre-eminent freight power of the network, displacing the 2-8-2 type from first-line service. While other roads obtained much more massive freight power, such as 2-10-0s and 2-10-4 types and a multitude of articulated designs, the New York Central, with its practically-gradeless high-speed riverside lines, needed speed over pulling power.

The 600 Mohawks delivered were divided into four main classes, plus a few experimental and prototypes that were rebuilt between 1922 and 1939.

== L-1a, b, c, d ==

The first Mohawks delivered for the NYC were delivered by ALCO in 1916; these were purely freighters, with 69-inch drivers and small four axle tenders, though they would almost universally later be refitted with more six-axle examples. They would be equipped with the appropriate accouterment of the time; kerosene headlights, straight running boards, full pilots, Cole trailing trucks, and in some cases Russia iron boiler jackets. 

Further orders of L-1 subclasses followed in subsequent years, all built by ALCO except the L-1cs, which would be built by the Lima Locomotive Works. These engines were built with clean lines and a notable lack of appliances, though they would be modified extensively in the coming years. As with the tenders, the earlier L-1s would later be fitted with feedwater heaters, with the majority sporting Elesco bundle-type and Coffin internal feedwater heaters, though a handful of examples on the subsidiary Peoria &amp; Eastern (as well as one on the NYC proper) had open-cycle Worthington SA type units, and one each were furnished with the Elesco coil type (#2503) and the external Coffin variety. The vast majority of Elesco bundle-type equipped L-1s had them installed protruding forward, as seen universally on the L-2a subclass. However, there is evidence of at least one unit (#2568) having the feedwater heater installed in the semi-sunken fashion seen on some of the Central&#x27;s H-7e Mikados.

One modification to the L-1s made in the 1920s was the installation of mechanical stokers, mostly of the duplex type, which were fitted universally, easing the job of the firemen. Many L-1s would also see their original fabricated Cole trailing trucks replaced with single-piece cast Deltas. Additionally, those constructed with full pilots would all have them swapped for footboard freight pilots by the 1920s. Some units would be fitted with booster-equipped trailing trucks, an invention of the New York Central&#x27;s mechanical department. 

185 L-1 locomotives were produced. The L-1a&#x27;s were numbered 2500–2529, the L-1b&#x27;s were numbered 2530–2584, the L-1c&#x27;s were numbered 2585-2639 and the L-1d&#x27;s were numbered 2640–2684. Interestingly, in the 1936 fleet-wide renumbering, the L-1s would remain untouched, retaining their as-built numbers.

When they were introduced in the late 1910&#x27;s, the L-1s were the preeminent examples of hauling power on the New York Central, and served extensively on the main line from New York to Chicago. Gradually, as the L-2s rolled off ALCO&#x27;s production line in the 1920s, many of the L-1s were displaced, with most of them stationed on the Central&#x27;s Pennsylvania Division. As a consequence of the Great Depression and the associated decline in freight traffic, some were retired permanently or put into long-term storage. 

By the late 1930s and the introduction of the L-3s, it was a rarity to see an L-1 outside those operating zones, where they served alongside the NE-2s, the NYC&#x27;s articulated 2-6-6-2s. An exception would be the few operated by the Peoria and Eastern, which operated in Illinois and Indiana, though again they were largely limited in the scope of their travel. Much like their cousins on the Pennsylvania Division, they would last until the dieselization of the 1950s, and would all be retired by 1957.

==Experimental 3-cylindered==
The New York Central had two L-1 locomotives, numbered 2518 and 2605, rebuilt by ALCO in 1922 with three cylinders to help determine if the arrangement was worthwhile. They were substantially more powerful than the two-cylinder models, but it was debatable if the additional maintenance requirements of a third, central cylinder, valve gear, main rod and crank axle were worth the performance boost. In 1924, locomotive 2569 was rebuilt by Alco as a Class L-1b-3 Cylinder. The NYC must have come down on the negative side of that question, for no more were built.

==L-2a, b, c, d==

The next development of the Mohawk type for the New York Central was the L-2, 300 of its various subclasses being built between 1925 and 1930 by the American Locomotive Company. These were more modern locomotives than the L-1 class with wide boilers, long tenders, and fitted with feedwater heaters (mostly of the Elesco type and generally mounted in front of the smokebox at the top). Later L-2 subclasses, the L-2b and L-2c, had somewhat smoother lines with recessed feedwater heaters. The later L-2 locomotives, from a front-on view, appeared quite similar to the Central&#x27;s fleet of Hudson passenger locomotives. The L2a&#x27;s were numbered 2700–2799, the L2b&#x27;s were numbered 2900–2924, the L2c&#x27;s were numbered 2800-2899 and the L2d&#x27;s were numbered 2925-2949 and 2950–2999. Locomotives 2995 and 2998 were modified for high-speed service in 1939.

==L-3a, b, c==

The next development of the Mohawk type was that of the dual-service locomotive, capable of working passenger as well as freight trains. Passenger service required the ability to work at , as opposed to the required of freight. The NYC&#x27;s fleet of Hudsons, 275 strong though it was, was proving inadequate to handle peak traffic demands, and some dual-purpose power would fix the problem nicely as well as giving the ability to handle express freight and mail services.

Two L-2 locomotives were given modifications for dual service work: higher boiler pressure, smaller cylinders, lightweight reciprocating parts, dynamic counterbalancing of the drivers, roller bearings on all axles and so forth. The success of these modifications prompted the construction of 65 units of the L-3 class in 1940, 25 of which were built for dual-service and the remaining 40 for freight-only; as a result, the first 25 were equipped with roller bearings on every axle while the remaining 40 had roller bearings on every axle except for the drivers. Other major difference between L-3as and L-3b/c included footboard pilots and the addition of a trailing truck booster engine used on the L-3b/c. The Class L-3a&#x27;s were numbered 3000–3024, made by ALCO. The Class L-3b&#x27;s were numbered 3025–3049, with ALCO producing the first ten (3025-3034) and Lima producing the remaining fifteen (3035-3049). The L-3c&#x27;s were essentially 15 additional copies of the ALCO made L-3bs, numbered 3050–3064. All had oval NYC emblems under their smokebox engine number placards.

Notably, the Lima made L-3bs had a distinct smokebox front appearance, with a plated-over Elesco feedwater heater giving them their distinct look. 

All L-3 locomotives were given axle-spacing that could accommodate 72&quot; drivers, but only one was ever fitted with such. This locomotive, #3000, paved the way for the final class of Mohawks on the New York Central, the L-4. The other 64 engines received 69&quot; drivers.

==L-4a, b’s==
50 L-4 locomotives were produced by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1942. None of them had booster engines, although they were built to accommodate them should they ever need to start heavy trains, but were never so modified. The L-4s were versatile locomotives, with 72&quot; drivers, and worked the heaviest freight and passenger trains during World War II. 

The L-3 and L-4 classes had large tenders riding on two six-wheel trucks that were almost as long as the locomotives hauling them, and were mostly coal space with a capacity of 43 tons; water was taken en route using the tender scoop from track pans and thus the locomotives did not need to have a large on-board water capacity. Some L-4s had Scullin Disc drivers. The L4a&#x27;s and L4b&#x27;s were numbered 3100-3124 and 3125–3149, respectively, and all were equipped with roller bearings on every axle. All L-4a&#x27;s bore the above-described NYC &quot;passenger&quot; logo plates underneath their front smokebox number plates.

Many L-4 locomotives were fitted with smoke deflectors around 1945/46, after initial delivery in 1942.

==Preservation==
Only two Mohawks out of the original 600 built are preserved. One of them, No. 2933, is a 1929 ALCO-built L-2d and resides at the National Museum of Transportation, Kirkwood, Missouri. The other Mohawk, No. 3001, is a 1940 ALCO-built L-3a at the National New York Central Railroad Museum in Elkhart, Indiana and is the largest surviving NYC steam locomotive. In October 2024, the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society announced that they had acquired No. 3001 and made plans to eventually restore it to operating condition.

Two Mohawk tenders also still exist. The tender from 2662, a class L-1d, is currently in use behind Western Maryland Scenic Railroad 734 (ex-Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad 2-8-0 34) in Cumberland, Maryland. The tender for L-3b 3042 was converted into a canteen and was used with Reading T-1 4-8-4 2101 during its 1976 tour with the American Freedom Train, as well as with the Chessie System Special. It was later damaged in a roundhouse fire in 1979. This water tender is currently behind L3a 3001 at the National New York Central Railroad Museum in Elkhart, Indiana. The tender was sold to the Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society in September 2023 along with 3001.

<text>The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (), abbreviated as VMRO-DPMNE (), is a conservative and the main centre-right to right-wing political party in North Macedonia.

It was established as a nationalist and anti-communist party. It has later rebranded itself as Christian-democratic. The party claims that their goals and objectives are to express the tradition of the Macedonian people on whose political struggle and concepts it is based. Nevertheless, it has formed multiple coalition governments with ethnic minority parties. Under the leadership of Ljubčo Georgievski in the 1990s, the party supported Macedonian independence from Socialist Yugoslavia, and led a policy of closer relationships with Bulgaria. Georgievski left VMRO-DPMNE and formed the VMRO – People&#x27;s Party in 2004.

Under the leadership of Nikola Gruevski, the party promoted ultranationalist identity politics in the form of antiquisation. Its nationalist stances were often also anti-Albanian. During Gruevski&#x27;s leadership the party changed from a pro-European and а pro-NATO policy, to a Russophilic, pro-Serbian and anti-Western one. His government also managed to build strong anti-EU sentiments within the country.

==Background==
The party&#x27;s full name consists of the acronyms &quot;VMRO&quot; (standing for &quot;Vnatrešna Makedonska Revolucionerna Organizacija&quot; and referencing the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), a rebel movement formed in 1893) and &quot;DPMNE&quot; (Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity, &quot;Demokratska partija za makedonsko nacionalno edinstvo&quot;). After undergoing various transformations, the original organisation was suppressed after the military coup d&#x27;état of 1934, in its headquarters in Bulgaria. At that time the territory of the current North Macedonia was a province called Vardar Banovina, part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. As the Bulgarian army entered Yugoslav Macedonia as German satellite during WWII, former IMRO members were active in organising Bulgarian Action Committees, charged with taking over the local authorities. After Bulgaria switched to the Allied in September 1944, they tried to create a pro-Bulgarian independent Macedonian state under the protectorate of the Third Reich. VMRO–DPMNE claims ideological descent from the old IMRO, although there is no known continuity between the two organisations. The historical IMRO was as a whole pro-Bulgarian grouping, and its membership was allowed initially only for Bulgarians.

==History==

===Foundation and rise to power===
Following the death of Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito in 1980, SFR Yugoslavia began to disintegrate and democratic politics were revived in Macedonia. Many exiles returned to then SR Macedonia from abroad, and a new generation of young Macedonian intellectuals rediscovered the history of Macedonian nationalism. Dragan Bogdanovski who was a proclaimed Macedonian rights movement activist had made a blueprint for a &quot;Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity&quot;. He had also made a statute, book of rules, and an instruction of how the party will work. Ljubčo Georgievski and Bogdanovski, Boris Zmejkovski, and a few other activists agreed to make a party for a future independent Macedonia. Under the name VMRO–DPMNE, it was founded on 17 June 1990 in Skopje, as a Macedonian nationalist and anti-communist party. Georgievski was elected as the party&#x27;s first president in the constituent assembly. The party advocated for the independence of Macedonia, the withdrawal of the Yugoslav National Army, creation of a Macedonian defence force, establishment of an independent currency and international recognition as a sovereign state. 

After the first multi-party elections in 1990, VMRO–DPMNE became the strongest party in the parliament. It did not form a government because it did not achieve a majority of seats; this forced it to form a coalition with an ethnic Albanian party, but it refused to do so. The party boycotted the second round of the 1994 elections claiming fraud in the first round. During the early 1990s, the party presented itself as an extreme right-wing nationalist party with anti-Albanian sentiments. It also promoted the irredentist concept of United Macedonia. By the mid-1990s, it created offices in most major cities. The party opposed the 1995 Interim Accord with Greece. During that period, the party moderated its rhetoric. After winning the 1998 election, VMRO–DPMNE formed a coalition government with the Democratic Alternative and Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), with Georgievski as Prime Minister. In 1999, VMRO–DPMNE&#x27;s candidate Boris Trajkovski was elected President. Under Georgievski, there was an improvement in Bulgaria–Macedonia relations. He signed a bilateral agreement with Bulgarian prime minister Ivan Kostov regarding good neighbourly relations.

In 2001, the party participated in a government of national unity. VMRO–DPMNE&#x27;s government was defeated at the 2002 parliamentary elections. In an alliance with the Liberal Party of Macedonia, VMRO–DPMNE won 28 out of 120 seats. In 2004, Trajkovski died in a plane crash and Branko Crvenkovski was elected president, defeating VMRO–DPMNE&#x27;s candidate Saško Kedev. After losing the 2002 elections, Georgievski left the party and established the VMRO-NP in 2004.

Nikola Gruevski was elected as the new leader of the party in May 2003. The widespread public support for EU membership in the 2000s encouraged the party to evolve into a moderate and pro-European party. It also rebranded itself as centre-right and Christian democratic. VMRO-DPMNE opposed the legalisation of the Tetovo University in early 2004. The party became the largest party in parliament again after a net gain of over a dozen seats in the 2006 parliamentary elections. With 44 of 120 seats, the party formed a government in coalition with the DPA again, with Gruevski becoming the prime minister. In its 2006 party programme, it emphasised the pursuit of EU and NATO membership as its major foreign policy goals. On 15 May 2007, the party became an observer-member of the European People&#x27;s Party.

The party won 2008 early parliamentary elections. In the 120-seat Assembly, VMRO–DPMNE won 63 seats and formed a coalition government with the Democratic Union for Integration. In 2009, the VMRO–DPMNE-led coalition &quot;For a better Macedonia&quot; won 56 out of 84 municipalities, the party&#x27;s presidential candidate Gjorge Ivanov also won the presidential election. The party won again in the 2011 early parliamentary elections. VMRO–DPMNE won 56 seats of the 120-seat Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the party formed a government in coalition with the Democratic Union for Integration in the Macedonian Parliament (mandate period 2011–2015). In 2014, early parliamentary elections were held together with the presidential election, VMRO–DPMNE won again 61 seats of the 120-seat Assembly and formed a government in coalition with the Democratic Union for Integration (mandate period 2014–2018).

=== Antiquisation and Skopje 2014 ===

The party pursued the &quot;antiquisation&quot; policy between 2006 and 2017, in which it sought to claim ancient Macedonian figures like Alexander the Great and Philip II of Macedon for the country. The policy was pursued since its coming to power in 2006, and especially since Macedonia&#x27;s non-invitation to NATO in 2008, as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as in an attempt to construct a new identity on the basis of a presumed link to the world of antiquity. The policy received academic criticism as it demonstrated feebleness of archaeology and other historical disciplines in public discourse, as well as a danger of marginalization. The policy also attracted criticism domestically, by ethnic Macedonians within the country, who saw as dangerously dividing the country between those who identify with classical antiquity and those who identify with the country&#x27;s Slavic culture. Ethnic Albanians saw it as an attempt to marginalize them and exclude them from the national narrative. Bulgaria also accused the country of falsification of history. According to researcher Anastas Vangeli, it harmed interethnic relations and the country&#x27;s international position. Foreign diplomats warned that the policy reduced international sympathy for Macedonia&#x27;s position in the naming dispute with Greece. SDSM was opposed to the Skopje 2014 project and alleged that the monuments could have cost six to ten times less than what the government paid, which may already have exceeded 600 million euros. In 2012, a statue of the member of the IMRO Simeon Radev, who was also a Bulgarian diplomat, was installed on the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but it was later taken down, and according to Makfax, with the explanation that it had been a mistake. The party built new headquarters for itself in Skopje in 2015.

=== Macedonian political crisis ===

In the 2010s and the 2020s, Georgievski criticised the party several times, seeing it as a personal failure and a fake party without any ideology, etc. The party opposed the Friendship Treaty with Bulgaria in 2017.

As a result of the political crisis, the political parties signed the Pržino Agreement, which also resulted in the resignation of Gruevski in January 2016. VMRO-DPMNE was widely accused of nepotism and authoritarianism and was involved in a series of wiretapping, corruption and money-laundering scandals, with the Macedonian Special Prosecution ordering in 2017 a series of investigations against the party&#x27;s former leader and ex-Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, as well as ministers and other high-ranked officials, for involvement in illegal activities. In 2018, amid ongoing investigations, a Skopje court froze the party&#x27;s property assets. Gruevski himself was sentenced to two years in prison for the illegal purchase of a Mercedes car in 2018 but fled to Hungary when he was ordered to serve his prison sentence. Nevertheless, he remained an honorary chairman of the party until July 2020. On 8 October 2018, Gordana Jankulovska, the former Minister of Interior and senior member of the party, was sentenced to six years in prison for illegally purchasing the Mercedes, which Gruevski had used secretly.

=== Mickoski&#x27;s leadership ===
Hristijan Mickoski became the leader of the party on 23 December 2017, replacing Gruevski. VMRO-DPMNE has been criticised for its hard-line stance against the Prespa Agreement that was reached in June 2018 between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, which resolved the long-standing Macedonia naming dispute by renaming the country as North Macedonia and recognising that Macedonian culture and language are distinct and unrelated to ancient Hellenic civilisation. On 16 October 2018, US Assistant Secretary of State Wess Mitchell sent a letter to Mickoski, in which he expressed the disappointment of the United States with the positions of the party&#x27;s leadership, including him personally, regarding its position against the Prespa agreement and asked him to &quot;set aside partisan interests&quot; and work to get the name change approved. Despite the party&#x27;s opposition, eight deputies of the party voted in favour of the initiation of the constitutional amendments to allow the country&#x27;s name change.

In April 2022, a Bulgarian club named after the last leader of the historical IMRO, Ivan Mihailov, was officially opened in Bitola. After its opening, the club was set on fire, and Mickoski demanded that the arsonist, who was arrested, be released. The deputy chairman of the party Alexander Nikoloski expressed later his support to the decision of the Commission for Protection against Discrimination, which announced that the club &quot;Ivan Mihailov&quot; is discriminative towards the citizens of the country on national and ethnic grounds. VMRO-DPMNE deputy Rashela Mizrahi declared also the last leader of the organisation whose name it bears to be a fascist. Later, the party submitted a bill demanding that such names be banned for use in the country to increase distancing from fascism and Nazism. The bill was adopted, in collaboration with the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia.

The party became the main oppositional force which participated in the 2022 North Macedonia protests, surrounding its accession into the EU. In September 2022, the party proposed a referendum under which the friendship treaty between Bulgaria and North Macedonia would be denounced. The party is against the recognition of the Bulgarians in North Macedonia as an official ethnic minority, which is conditio sine qua non the country to become a member of the EU. In this way, the party effectively halted the European integration of North Macedonia. The party won the 2024 parliamentary elections. It formed a government with VLEN and ZNAM in June.

== Youth Force Union ==
The &quot;Youth Force Union&quot; (), also known as UMS (), is the youth wing organisation of the VMRO-DPMNE, formed in 1991.

A number of projects arising from the Youth Force Union were conducted in the past 20 years. It organised demonstrations against the introduction of the Albanian language in the pedagogical faculty of the University of Skopje in 1997.

<text>The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia ( – СДСМ, &quot;Socijaldemokratski sojuz na Makedonija&quot; – SDSM, – LSDM) is a social democratic political party, and the main centre-left party in North Macedonia. The party is pro-European.

The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia was founded on 20 April 1991 at the 11th Congress of the League of Communists of Macedonia, when it was transformed into the SDSM. The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia is a member of the Progressive Alliance and an associate affiliate of the Party of European Socialists (PES). The party supported a practical solution to the Macedonia naming dispute with Greece, which succeeded under the Prespa Agreement.

==History==
The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia was established on 20 April 1991. Its roots can be traced to 1943 upon the formation of the Communist Party of Macedonia (CPM) during World War II in the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. The CPM became the League of Communists of Macedonia (LCM) in 1952 and was the ruling party of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Branko Crvenkovski was elected as the president and Nikola Popovski was elected as the vice president of the party. It retained the resources and the organisation of its predecessor. Unlike its rival VMRO-DPMNE, the party has traditionally had support from the urban middle-classes, the former Yugoslav managerial elite and the former &quot;nomenklatura&quot;.

It formed the first political government in 1992. SDSM experienced its first major split when Petar Gošev established the Democratic Party in 1993. In 1994, SDSM created the &quot;Alliance of Macedonia&quot;, together with the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party. The party formed a coalition government with the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity. The party&#x27;s president Crvenkovski served as the prime minister of Macedonia from 1992 to 1998. During 1997 and the first half of 1998, Crvenkovski and his governing centre-left coalition were criticised by the public due to the high unemployment rates (42 per cent in 1997 and 41 per cent in 1998), rampant corruption, insider privatization, dysfunctionally high levels of taxation, failure to attract foreign investment, and the slow pace of reforms aimed at giving ethnic Albanians, Turks, and Roma people equal status with ethnic Macedonians. The party lost the 1998 elections.

In 2001, SDSM was part of the short-lived government of national unity during the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia, which also consisted of VMRO-DPMNE, Party for Democratic Prosperity and Democratic Party of Albanians. After the 2002 Macedonian parliamentary election, the party became the biggest party, winning 60 out of 120 seats in the Assembly of Macedonia as the largest party of the Together for Macedonia alliance, which it co-led with the Liberal Democratic Party. Together for Macedonia ruled in coalition with the Democratic Union for Integration.

SDSM defines itself as a social democratic party. It was a member of the Socialist International, while it is currently a member of the Progressive Alliance and an associate affiliate of the Party of European Socialists (PES). Crvenkovski won the 2004 presidential elections, becoming the President of Macedonia, a post that he held until May 2009. Vlado Bučkovski became the party&#x27;s president, serving as party leader and Prime Minister until 2006. On 30 November 2005, a prominent member of SDSM, Tito Petkovski, who ran for president in 1999 and came in second place, left the party to form the New Social Democratic Party. This resulted in the second major split of the party. The party was defeated in the 2006 parliamentary elections, with the main reasons being the high rate of unemployment, corruption scandals, and concessions in favour of the Albanians taken to implement the Ohrid Framework Agreement.

After 2006, SDSM was led by Radmila Šekerinska. In the 2008 parliamentary elections, the coalition &quot;Sun – Coalition for Europe&quot; (of which SDSM was the leading party) was defeated, receiving 27 of the 120 seats. In the 2009 local elections, the Social Democrats won in 8 out of 84 municipalities in the country. After the electoral defeat, Šekerinska resigned and was succeeded by a mayor of Strumica, Zoran Zaev. In May 2009, after finishing the 5-year-term as President of Macedonia, Crvenkovski returned to the SDSM and was re-elected as leader of the party. He reorganised the party profoundly, but resigned after the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2013 local elections. In June 2013, Zaev was elected as the leader.

The party was defeated in the 2014 general elections by the VMRO-DPMNE, but the results were not recognised and the opposition parties boycotted the Parliament. From February to May 2015, Zaev released wiretapped material that incriminated Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski for illegally spying on more than 20,000 citizens. In May, large protests including SDSM members began in Skopje. Large crowds gathered to protest on May 17, demanding resignation from Gruevski, who refused to step down and organized a pro-government rally the following day. The number of protesters was estimated to be more than 40,000. Zaev claimed the number of protesters reached 100,000, and said that some of them will remain there until Gruevski resigns. European Union diplomats offered to mediate a solution to the crisis. The political crisis was resolved with the Pržino Agreement in July 2015, which obliged a resignation from Gruevski, participation of SDSM in the ministries, and early parliament elections. In the elections on 11 December 2016, the party won almost 440,000 votes and 49 MPs which was the second-best result in SDSM&#x27;s history, after the result from 2002. In April 2017, SDSM formed a coalition with the Albanian parties (Democratic Union for Integration, Besa, and Alliance for Albanians) and in the next month, it formed a government. The party won 57 municipalities in the local elections in October. During the government&#x27;s rule, North Macedonia joined NATO and agreements with Bulgaria and Greece were also signed, with the latter resolving the Macedonia naming dispute.

Before the 2020 parliamentary elections, the party rebranded, changing its logo to be similar to other European social democratic parties, and changing its primary colour to red. In the elections, it campaigned for continuing to pursue membership in the EU. It created a government in August after winning 46 seats. After its defeat in the 2021 local elections in North Macedonia when it lost 57 municipalities, Zaev stepped down as the party&#x27;s president. On 12 December 2021, the party&#x27;s internal leadership elections were held and the former deputy Finance Minister, Dimitar Kovačevski, was elected as the party&#x27;s president and he became the prime minister in January 2022. In the 2024 parliamentary election, the party had its worst result, winning only 18 seats in the Assembly. It resulted in the resignation of the party&#x27;s leadership. On 30 June, the former health minister of North Macedonia, Venko Filipče, became the party&#x27;s president.

<doc id="424634" wikidata="Q813939" url="?curid=424634" title="Bedout">
<text>Bedout , or more specifically the Bedout High, is a geological and geophysical feature centered about off the northwestern coast of Australia in the Canning and overlying Roebuck basins. Although not obvious from sea floor topography, it is a roughly circular area about in diameter where older rocks have been uplifted as much as towards the surface and may mark the centre of a very large buried impact crater up to in diameter. The Bedout High was penetrated by two petroleum exploration wells (Bedout-1, Lagrange-1) in the 1970s and 1980s. It is named after nearby Bedout Island.

== Impact hypothesis ==
In 1996 Australian geologist John Gorter first suggested that the Bedout High might mark the centre of a very large buried impact crater up to in diameter, based mainly on its internal geological structure as revealed on a single seismic survey line, and suggested that it may be of near end Permian age, based on the reported age of volcanic rocks in Lagrange-1. The impact hypothesis was developed further by Luanne Becker (University of California) and coworkers who claimed to have confirmed that the supposed volcanic rocks in the petroleum wells are actually impact melt breccia showing evidence of shock metamorphism, and re-dated these rocks at 250.1 ± 4.5 Ma. The new age is essentially coincident with the Permian–Triassic boundary and associated extinction event, and Becker speculates that there is a likely connection. It was subsequently reported, based on very limited preliminary data, that the impact hypothesis is further supported by chromium isotope evidence for the presence of extraterrestrial material.

== Rebuttals to the impact hypothesis ==
The Bedout impact hypothesis has not been widely supported by impact cratering specialists. Specific counter claims include:
# The alleged impact melt breccia actually has the characteristics of a volcanic basalt, in part altered by contact with sea water and metamorphism due to its deep burial, and the evidence for shock metamorphism is likely mistaken.
# A crater of the purported size would have produced a widespread layer of ejecta, but no such eject is evident at the nearest Permian-Triassic boundary sites in Australia. 
# The presented evidence for impact fails to meet established standards, and the dating methodology is flawed.
# A detailed re-evaluation of the geophysical data indicates that the evidence is not consistent with the expected properties of a giant impact crater, but rather the Bedout High was likely the result of episodes of continental rifting.

<doc id="424637" wikidata="Q3895787" url="?curid=424637" title="Pardon the Interruption">
<text>Pardon the Interruption (abbreviated PTI) is an American sports talk television show that airs weekdays primarily on ESPN but can air on various TV channels in the event of live sports or breaking news. It is hosted by Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon since the beginning, they discuss, and usually argue over, the top stories of that particular day in &quot;sports... and other stuff&quot; (as Kornheiser put it in the show&#x27;s original promo).

Similar in format to Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert&#x27;s &quot;At the Movies&quot;, &quot;PTI&quot; is known for its playful banter between the cohosts, humorous and often loud tone, and a &quot;rundown&quot; graphic which lists the topics yet to be discussed on the right-hand side of the screen. The show&#x27;s popularity has led to the creation of similar shows on ESPN and similar segments on other series, and the rundown graphic has since been implemented on the morning editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, among many imitators.

==History==
The show began in 2001, and has emanated from Washington, D.C. since its debut, as both Kornheiser and Wilbon were writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; at the time, In addition, both men appeared frequently on ESPN&#x27;s Sunday-morning discussion program &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot;. The pair&#x27;s frequent arguments during their time at the &quot;Post&quot; are often cited (including by Wilbon himself) as both the antecedent and inspiration for &quot;PTI&quot;.

The founding production team behind &quot;PTI&quot; includes Mark Shapiro, Erik Rydholm, Todd Mason, James Cohen, and Joseph Maar. The original deal was for two years with an option for a third. Originally, the show also aired Sunday evening, but this stint was short-lived.

Originally produced at Atlantic Video&#x27;s facilities in Washington, the show now occupies space at ABC News&#x27; Washington bureau. Voice actress Kat Cressida lends her voice to commercial bumpers for the series and has since its premiere. From the premiere of &quot;PTI&quot; until September 5, 2014, Tony Reali served as the show&#x27;s statistician (earning him the nickname &quot;Stat Boy&quot;) and eventually became a de facto co-host. Reali became the host of &quot;Around the Horn&quot; in 2004, but remained on &quot;PTI&quot; until 2014, when he relocated to New York City to work on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; while continuing as host of &quot;ATH&quot;.

Kornheiser began exclusively hosting from his home upon the show&#x27;s return from its 2020 COVID-19 hiatus, though he made an in-studio appearance on December 5, 2023 but cautioned to viewers &quot;Don&#x27;t get used to it.&quot; He has since returned to the studio on sporadic occasions when Wilbon was also in studio.

The show won a Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Studio Show in 2009, 2016, and 2019.

==Broadcast details==
&quot;PTI&quot; airs at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on ESPN, occasionally moving to ESPN2 in the event of live sports or breaking news coverage airing on the main channel. Replays also appear on ESPN2 or ESPNEWS at various times.
* In Canada, TSN airs the show live at 5:30 p.m. ET. In 2011, the &quot;SportsCentre&quot; edition following &quot;PTI&quot; now features the final segment, but previously TSN did not air it. Tony acknowledged this frequently at the end of the show, often signing off while waving a Canadian flag.
* Since April 17, 2006, ESPN has also offered a free audio podcast which cuts out commercials and includes all segments. The podcast is usually made available two to three hours after its original telecast on ESPN.
* BT Sport ESPN airs the show across the UK in a late night slot, usually at 11:30 p.m. unless pre-empted by live sports coverage. It is also repeated during the following day at 7:30 a.m.
* ESPN 3 Mexico, Central America &amp; Caribbean airs &quot;PTI&quot; in original language at 10:00 p.m. (Central Mexico Time) from Monday to Friday. The show is not broadcast in any other part of Latin America.
* Since May 7, 2018, PTI started to be aired on ESPN 5, the sports block of Philippine-based TV channel and ESPN affiliate The 5 Network, on a delayed telecast basis. It is aired weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Philippine Standard Time.

===Viewers===
&quot;PTI&quot; averages a little more than one million viewers daily.

Famous fans include Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, David Letterman, Tom Cotton, Hank Azaria, Chris Christie, Eric Stonestreet, Matthew Morrison, John Heilemann, Penny Marshall, Michael Kelly, Eva Longoria, John McCain, Tim Russert, and Maury Povich.

The October 24, 2011 episode featured a message from then-President Obama commemorating the tenth anniversary of the show. On July 12, 2013, Kornheiser, Wilbon, and Reali were guests at the White House. After lunch, the trio met in the Oval Office with Obama. Obama also provided taped congratulations on the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary episode on October 22, 2021.

==The set==

For much of its run &quot;PTI&quot; had a unique studio layout featuring a &quot;wall&quot; full of cut-out cardboard heads of athletes and celebrities that had been used in the &quot;Role Play&quot; segment, bobblehead dolls of the show&#x27;s hosts and Reali, Etch-A-Sketch art of Kornheiser and Wilbon, multiple penguins and several other toys and trinkets they have received, such as Kornheiser&#x27;s beloved &quot;Leg Lamp&quot; from &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, Stewie Griffin, and Elmo.

For different American holidays, the set would be decorated with other props to match the theme of the day. For example, on Halloween, carved jack-o&#x27;-lanterns of the host&#x27;s heads are also present. The color of the rundown graphic is also changed to fit with the holiday theme (e.g. red, white, and blue to represent Independence Day, green for St. Patricks Day, red and green for Christmas).

On September 27, 2010, &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; and &quot;Around the Horn&quot; began broadcasting in high definition and moved from the Atlantic Video Washington complex to facilities in the ABC News Washington bureau, where high definition sets were built for both shows.

On January 20, 2020, the current set for &quot;PTI&quot; debuted. This was the first major upgrade to the &quot;PTI&quot; set in nearly a decade.

==Segments==
&quot;PTI&quot; is divided into three segments. The first involves the hosts discussing and debating sports news Headlines (generally, three topics are covered, each receiving 2–4 minutes, in earlier days, more topics were covered with less time assigned to each). The second segment will either consist of a themed game segment that allows for discussion for further topics, or 5 Good Minutes, an interview with a guest. The third segment consists of Happy Time, an acknowledgment of any &quot;errors &amp; omissions&quot; from earlier segments, and finally the Big Finish, a high-speed, back-and-forth rundown of more sports topics of note.

For much of its history, the show aired in four shorter segments, allowing for the inclusion of both a game and an interview, or occasionally, a second segment of &quot;Headlines&quot; replacing one of the two. A wider variety of games were played during the time Reali was present on the show, as he would frequently serve as in-studio host/moderator/judge.

In the show&#x27;s earliest days, it was not unusual for the last point or topic in each section to be about a non-sports-related pop-culture event, but those have been eliminated.

On rare occasions, the show will stray from its basic format, such as on August 9, 2005, when baseball commissioner Bud Selig was the guest at the very top of the show for an extended interview.

===Introduction/Headlines===
Kornheiser and Wilbon welcome viewers to the show with opening banter. Wilbon usually opens the show with the line, &quot;Pardon the Interruption... but I&#x27;m Mike Wilbon,&quot; and then put a question to Kornheiser concerning one of the day&#x27;s sports or pop culture issues (which he answers sarcastically). The two will then continue a conversation while the opening title card is shown. The theme song (as well as the commercial outro music) thematically references the song &quot;Cut Your Hair&quot; by Pavement. On rare occasions when more serious news will lead the discussion, such as the death of Junior Seau, the hosts will omit their typical intro banter.

Kornheiser then says &quot;Welcome to &#x27;PTI&#x27;, boys and girls.&quot; Kornheiser then gives a brief introduction before moving on to the first topic. During the course of this segment, Wilbon and Kornheiser will alternate topic introductions up for debate. Each topic is listed in chronological order on the right side of the screen, and a countdown timer is shown indicating how much time is allotted to discuss a particular topic, the hosts can, and usually do, briefly go over the time limit in order to make a final point about any particular topic.

===Five Good Minutes===
Kornheiser and Wilbon interview a sports figure, writer, or analyst typically for a period of time from three to six minutes. The interview itself is actually recorded prior to the rest of the show and then trimmed down for broadcast. According to &quot;PTI&quot;&#x27;s remote producer, with some exceptions, guests are booked the day of the show as they try to obtain the most relevant news of the day. Other times, there are two &quot;Five Good Minutes&quot; segments with two different guests, there are also shows where two related guests appear during one segment, such as Joe Buck and Tim McCarver of &quot;Major League Baseball on Fox&quot; broadcasts (Another example of this was Al Michaels and Doc Rivers, when they appeared together while covering the 2004 NBA Finals for ABC Sports). There have also been occasions where Kornheiser or Wilbon, while on vacation or in another city to cover an event and not hosting the show, have been the subject of &quot;Five Good Minutes&quot; themselves.

Guests almost always appear from a separate location, usually the site of an upcoming game or their home city, appearing with the hosts via split screen. On a few occasions, the guest has appeared in studio with Kornheiser and Wilbon. This may be the case if the guest is an athlete or coach in Washington to play a game that night, such as when Denver Nuggets guard Chauncey Billups appeared on February 6, 2009, prior to a game against the Washington Wizards. When this happens, the guest will sit on Wilbon&#x27;s side of the table, sitting diagonally from Kornheiser.

On Thursdays during the football season, ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski, a former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback (a.k.a. &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;the Polish Rifle&quot; - the latter usually rendered in a Howard Cosell-like voice), frequently guested, until his departure from ESPN. Before that, Jaworski would come on the show on Mondays to offer analysis of the previous day&#x27;s games and a prediction for the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game that night.

On rare occasions, &quot;Five Good Minutes&quot; runs especially long, such as on June 8, 2005, when NFL agent Drew Rosenhaus&#x27;s interview ran 11 minutes, forcing the cancellation of the following segment (Role Play), on March 23, 2007, when USC basketball coach Tim Floyd&#x27;s interview ran 9 minutes as he talked about O. J. Mayo, and on October 22, 2009, as reporter Jackie MacMullan discussed the Magic Johnson/Isiah Thomas controversy, forcing the cancellation of the segment Report Card.

On very rare occasions during the show&#x27;s four-segment format, two separate games were played in lieu of an interview segment.

===&quot;Game&quot; segments===
&quot;PTI&quot; uses a variety of different game-themed segments to talk about other sports news and make predictions. Many games have been played over the years, but as of 2021, four remain in the regular rotation:

*Mail Time: the hosts read and respond to viewer e-mail that they take out of a talking mailbox. Early in &quot;PTI&#x27;&quot;s run, an intern named Josh read the mail to the hosts. When the show changed over to the talking mailbox, Wilbon would express disgust at the mail voice, demanding it be omitted. The mail read on air is no longer written by viewers, but rather staff of the show itself.
*Toss Up: the two hosts choose between two sides of a topic announced by the producer, Erik Rydholm, over the loudspeaker, and Kornheiser always claims to be the winner.
*What&#x27;s The Word? Introduced in 2009. Reali (later Rydholm) read a partial sentence and the hosts each offer an adjective to fill the blank(s) in the sentence. The game often involves made up or hyphenated words, and usually ends with Kornheiser using an adjective to aggrandize himself or berate Wilbon, such as saying he won with a &quot;Korn-ucopia&quot; of words, or that Wilbon &quot;got Wil-bombed.&quot;
*Psychic Hotline sees the hosts answer questions read by staffers, presented as emanating from an on-set crystal ball. Kornheiser dons a stereotypical fortune-teller costume.

In addition, on the last show before Thanksgiving, the game segment is usually reserved for the hosts to reveal their choices for Turkeys of the Year, usually people during the last year that have usually done notably stupid acts un-befitting of sport (funny or unfunny). As noted by Wilbon at the beginning of the segment, there are no criteria for the selection process, meaning anyone they see fit is eligible. Over the years, the list has vastly expanded from five to numerous candidates being named during the segment.

Among games no longer regularly played:

Odds Makers, which is featured weekly and involves the hosts giving their prediction in the form of a percentage about the likeliness of a future event occurring. Reali gives the topics and keeps track of responses on a chalkboard, to which he refers at the end of the segment in order to declare a winner. A selection at either extreme of 100% or 0% is well-respected, with the latter being coined by Reali as &quot;squadoosh.&quot; Kornheiser often gets his odds to add up to a certain number or form a pattern. &quot;Odds Makers&quot; is also noted for its feud between Reali and guest host Dan LeBatard, who is often accused of ruining the game.

Role Play, featured fairly often but less so than earlier in &quot;PTI&#x27;&quot;s run, is referred to as &quot;Heads on Sticks&quot; because the hosts alternate speaking as a sports figure with the person&#x27;s picture on a stick in front of their faces. After a picture is used, it is usually stuck somewhere in the background of the set until it is replaced. The crude connotation of this title has been highlighted as a suggestive musical cue leads the segment.

&quot;Over/Under&quot;, is a segment that alternated weeks with Odds Makers when they were first introduced, but is now featured only occasionally. The hosts argue over whether a certain sports figure or team will go over or under a certain number (e.g. 40 home runs, 60 wins). Reali also announces the topics for this segment, holding cards up with the statistic, as well. In order to help prevent a &quot;push&quot; (a Wilbon trademark), a decimal figure is sometimes used (e.g. 2.5 touchdowns).

&quot;Report Card&quot;, saw the hosts assign letter grades to various events suggested by &quot;Professor&quot; Reali. Usually, Kornheiser&#x27;s name is spelled &quot;Tiny&quot; instead of &quot;Tony&quot; on the Report Card board.

In Good Cop, Bad Cop, both hosts dress in police hats and sometimes sunglasses. This segment is featured rarely, and unlike Toss Up, the hosts must take an opposite stand on each topic, saying it is either good or bad. This segment is occasionally renamed &quot;Good Elf, Bad Elf&quot; for the holiday.

&quot;Food Chain,&quot; where the hosts rank a top five list of teams, returned in December 2008 after a long absence. Kornheiser and Wilbon usually have variations in their lists, with Wilbon posting his as each team is introduced. Wilbon refers to his as &quot;A real man&#x27;s board!,&quot; but when Kornheiser switches to his, he claims, &quot;That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s the list!&quot; Another early segment was called &quot;Love Em or Leave Em&quot; where a female voice cooing &quot;Ooo La-La!&quot; was played before the hosts discussed an individual (whose head was on a stick) they were either &quot;leaving&quot; or &quot;loving&quot; and keeping on their side. A third rare segment is &quot;Fair or Foul,&quot; it was introduced on February 28, 2007, after the hosts began repeating the words &quot;fair or foul&quot; for a few episodes because of a viewer email including them earlier in the week. The hosts discuss a variety of topics and decide if each is fair or foul (acceptable or not). If a host believes a topic is &quot;foul,&quot; he could threw a yellow football penalty flag and/or blow a whistle.

Additionally, during the early run of &quot;PTI&quot;, a &quot;Doctors&quot; segment was featured occasionally, in which the hosts had to choose which head to cut off and throw in the trash out of two that were stuck together. The hosts dressed up as doctors for this segment, using coats and assorted accessories.

In &quot;Too Soon?,&quot; Reali asks the hosts if it&#x27;s too soon for a certain sports situation to possibly occur. In November 2010, a new game entitled &quot;Something or Nothing?&quot; was created. In this game, Reali asked Tony and Mike if a recent sports event was significant (Something) or insignificant (Nothing). After both hosts gave their answers, Reali, through uncertain logic, determined who was correct. &quot;Too Soon&quot; and &quot;Something or Nothing&quot; were played rarely. (In lieu of &quot;Something or Nothing,&quot; the hosts will occasionally base a headline debate on whether a story is &quot;a big deal, little deal, or no deal at all&quot;).

Finally, a &quot;time-machine&quot; game was played once in 2005 and never returned.

===Happy Time===
The hosts send out a &quot;Happy Birthday,&quot; a &quot;Happy (or in some cases, Not-So-Happy) Anniversary,&quot; and a &quot;Happy Trails&quot; (acknowledging a firing, injury, retirement, or such). If the &quot;Happy Trails&quot; segment covers a death, which the hosts often refer to as a &quot;Melancholy Trails,&quot; the background music goes silent as the hosts pay tribute to the person who died.

===Errors and omissions===
Any factual errors or omissions are swiftly rectified before the show plunges into its final 60–90 seconds.

===Big Finish===
From the start of the series until July 2005 and then again since August 2009, the show ends with the Big Finish, in which the hosts alternate quick takes on a list of roughly half a dozen final topics, usually ending with Wilbon answering which telecast of a pair posed by Kornheiser he will watch that evening, or predicting the outcome of a game to be played.

The hosts then give their standard signoffs:

Kornheiser: &quot;We&#x27;re out of time, we&#x27;ll try to do better next time. I&#x27;m Tony Kornheiser.&quot;

Wilbon: &quot; And I&#x27;m Mike Wilbon. Same time tomorrow (or &#x27;Have a great weekend&#x27;), knuckleheads.&quot;

The half-hour broadcast concludes with Kornheiser waving a small Canadian flag while Wilbon mentions their podcast and pitches the show over to the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; studio.

According to Kornheiser, he first waved the flag and said &quot;Goodnight, Canada&quot; after an associate director told him that the additional &quot;PTI&quot; segment on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; did not air in Canada. Kornheiser made the routine into a trademark sign-off and continued even after TSN added the extra segment to its early-evening edition of &quot;SportsCentre&quot;.

If a scant few seconds remain Kornheiser will often offer up a “shout-out” during the show&#x27;s final seconds, typically to friendly golf partners, a gift received from a viewer, or a plug for a restaurant or company he had recently received good service from.

===&quot;SportsCenter&quot; segment===
From July 25, 2005, through sometime in 2011, the format of the show was altered to merge the final part of the show with the beginning of the 6:00 p.m. ET &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

Segment 4 would consist of Happy Time, followed by Errors, then the hosts giving shout-outs, as well as their recommendations for television viewing for the night as the last discussion segment of the show before &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Wilbon usually chooses a sporting event, while Kornheiser will often opt for pop-culture based programming.

After the opening segment of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (normally 10–14 minutes), &quot;PTI&quot; returned to debate an additional sports-related topic, then end with The Big Finish and the typical goodbyes.

For the re-air on ESPN2, the show would move straight to the post-&quot;SportsCenter&quot; topic after the third commercial break, skipping segment 4. According to Nielsen ratings, &quot;PTI&quot; paired with &quot;Around the Horn&quot; combined to average more viewers than &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

During football season, Monday editions of &quot;PTI&quot; used to air in the former (30-minute) format, with no shoutouts or &quot;SportsCenter&quot; segment. Until midway through the 2008 season the show also took place at the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; host stadium as Kornheiser was a part of the Monday broadcast team, after that Kornheiser hosted from an undisclosed location in the host city while Wilbon hosted from the &quot;PTI&quot; studios in Washington. After Kornheiser&#x27;s departure from &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; after the 2008 season &quot;PTI&quot; reverted to its normal format for the 2009 football season after the first week of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, with Wilbon tossing to the &quot;NFL Countdown&quot; crew rather than to &quot;SportsCenter.&quot;

The show has since reverted to its original format where The Big Finish closes the show, though Kornheiser usually still offers shoutouts at the very end of the show. Wilbon and Kornheiser still have their additional debate as a part of &quot;SC&quot;, but it is no longer treated as a formal part of &quot;PTI&quot;.

==Running gags==
The longevity and popularity of the show has led to numerous running jokes between Wilbon and Kornheiser that longtime viewers will recognize. Some of these include such gags as &quot;The Bald Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;Blowed Out&quot;, &quot;(He&#x27;s) Ya Boy&quot;, &quot;Beatdown!&quot;, &quot;Strugg-a-ling&quot;, &quot;The Yanks and the Sawks!&quot;, &quot;Choking Dawgs!&quot;, &quot;The Penguin Dance&quot;, Kornheiser&#x27;s &quot;I-95 Bias&quot;, &quot;The Wilbon Power Rankings&quot;, &quot;Let Me Axe You Something&quot;, &quot;Uranus&quot;, &quot;Playoffs? Playoffs?&quot;, &quot;Ya Gotta Get Low&quot;, &quot;Bulls Corner&quot;, &quot;Drew Breeees&quot;, &quot;Washington &quot;Natinals&quot; (purposely mispronounced as such)&quot;, &quot;Good Night Canada&quot;, &quot;Ball/Puck Night!&quot;, &quot;The Lig&quot;, &quot;Tony&#x27;s &quot;Population Theory&quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Trampoline Bear&quot;.

In addition, for the first 3½ years of the show, Kornheiser only hosted a few shows away from the studio, with Wilbon during the week of Super Bowl XXXVI. Meanwhile, Wilbon has hosted many shows at the location of a sporting event he was attending. This has resulted in much teasing of Kornheiser by Wilbon, including Kornheiser&#x27;s fear of flying. Finally, on March 27, 2006, Kornheiser for the first time hosted the show away from the studio while Wilbon remained back at the set, as Kornheiser was in Orlando, Florida, covering the NFL owners meetings. For the first time in November 2006, Kornheiser and Wilbon &quot;chatted split-screen&quot; from two different locations away from Washington, D.C.

Usually during Report Card, Tony Kornheiser&#x27;s name is spelled as &quot;Tiny&quot; instead of &quot;Tony.&quot; Another common gag is during games such as Report Card and Odds Makers, Dan Le Batard&#x27;s name will often be Don, rather than Dan.

==PTI in other media==
The short-lived CBS show &quot;Listen Up&quot; was based on the life of Tony Kornheiser. In it, the main characters Tony Kleinman (Jason Alexander) and Bernie Widmer (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) co-hosted an off-beat sports show titled &quot;Listen Up!&quot; On the day &quot;Listen Up!&quot; debuted, Warner and Alexander appeared in character on &quot;PTI&quot;″s intro.

Kornheiser and Wilbon appeared as themselves on &quot;PTI&quot; in the 2004 film &quot;Mr. 3000&quot;, including doing a Role Play segment with Kornheiser posing as Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) at one point.

On February 8, 2006, it was announced that Tony Kornheiser would join Mike Tirico and Joe Theismann in the broadcast booth during &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; beginning in the 2006 NFL season. Kornheiser continued to host &quot;PTI&quot;, and Wilbon joined him on the road as they broadcast &quot;PTI&quot; each Monday from the site of the &quot;MNF&quot; game, and there has also been an extra &quot;PTI&quot; segment inserted during halftime of ESPN&#x27;s Monday night games (although in 2008, Wilbon stayed in the D.C. studios, on many Mondays).

&quot;PTI&quot; was featured in EA Sports video games due to the contract between ESPN and EA. The first game to have the feature is &quot;NBA Live 07&quot; for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

Wilbon is a frequent guest on Kornheiser&#x27;s eponymous podcast.

On October 8, 2010, &quot;South Park&quot; spoofed &quot;PTI&quot; in the Season 14 episode &quot;Poor and Stupid.&quot; When Wilbon is on camera you can see the cut outs of their likeness in the background.

On October 30, 2010, &quot;SportsNation&quot; did their entire 1 hour show in the style of &quot;PTI&quot;. At the end of the show Tony Reali ripped the show in a 1-minute rant.

On February 18, 2012, &quot;Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil&quot; featured Wilbon and Kornheiser as the local policemen with a nod to their good cop/bad cop &quot;PTI&quot; segment.

From 2011 to 2012, The Onion had a parody of &quot;PTI&quot;, &quot;Get Out Of My Face&quot; (aka &quot;GOOMF&quot;).

&quot;PTI&quot; was featured in the 2015 movie &quot;Creed&quot;.

==Guest hosts==
Over the history of the series, more than 30 guest hosts have stepped in whenever Kornheiser or Wilbon (or both) was absent. The current regular guest hosts are Frank Isola (&quot;Fill-in Frank&quot;), replacing Kornheiser, and Pablo S. Torre, replacing Wilbon. Mina Kimes also occasionally appears as a guest-host. All three are regulars on &quot;Around the Horn&quot;.

Bob Ryan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;Around the Horn&quot; was the show&#x27;s first regular guest host.

Dan Le Batard, of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; and his then-ESPN Radio program, was another frequent guest-host, known for his polarizing irreverence and for punctuating his first appearance in each show with a trademark &quot;BAM!!&quot;. Le Batard began hosting his own daily ESPN TV show from the same production company, &quot;Highly Questionable&quot;, in 2011, but still occasionally guest-hosted &quot;PTI&quot; until his 2021 departure from ESPN.

&quot;Around The Horn&quot; panelists J. A. Adande, Kevin Blackistone, Tim Cowlishaw, Dominique Foxworth, Israel Gutierrez, Jay Mariotti, Jackie MacMullan, Bill Plaschke and Michael Smith have also all had stints as guest hosts.

Others appearing over the years include David Aldridge, Skip Bayless, Jay Bilas, Norman Chad, Mike Golic, Sally Jenkins, Max Kellerman, Tim Kurkjian, Patrick McEnroe, Rachel Nichols, Keith Olbermann, Rick Reilly, Bill Simmons, T.J. Simers, Dan Shaughnessy, Stephen A. Smith, Michele Tafoya, Mike Tirico, Bob Valvano, Ralph Wiley and Jason Whitlock.

Kornheiser was absent more than usual during Summer 2006 for medical reasons. During a phone interview on the August 15, 2006 edition of &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;, Kornheiser explained this absence in most of July by revealing that he was recovering from skin cancer surgery.

==Influence==
Multiple commentators have credited &quot;PTI&quot; with inspiring and laying the groundwork for a number of successful TV sports debate shows, including &quot;Around the Horn&quot; and &quot;First Take&quot;.

==Cast==
* Tony Kornheiser (2001–Present) 
* Michael Wilbon (2001–Present)
* Tony Reali (2001–2014)

==Other versions==
Starting in the 2006 NFL season, Kornheiser and Wilbon began hosting &quot;PTI&quot; from the stadium that was hosting the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game. The following season, they began staging a live 3-topic, 3-minute version of the show during halftime of the game.

In 2004, Crackerjack Television started producing an Australian version of the show, which airs weekly on the Australian ESPN channel and features former Australian Rules footballer Sam Kekovich and radio and television broadcaster Russell Barwick. ESPN Australia also broadcasts the American version of &quot;PTI&quot; editions before &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

In August 2010, ESPN&#x27;s British channel (now BT Sport ESPN) debuted a British version of &quot;PTI&quot;. The show was hosted by Mark Chapman and Steve Bunce.

The ESPN Deportes show &quot;Cronómetro&quot; (Spanish for &quot;stopwatch&quot;) is modeled after &quot;PTI&quot; and &quot;Sports Reporters&quot;, in that it features personalities talking about sports subjects for a set amount of time. Unlike &quot;PTI&quot;, there are four panelists instead of two, and segments such as Role Play are not used. Five Good Minutes is used as a discussion of one subject between the four analysts. ESPN Brasil also has a version of Cronómetro called &quot;É Rapidinho&quot; (rough translation from Portuguese: &quot;It&#x27;s Fast&quot;).

<doc id="424638" wikidata="Q750116" url="?curid=424638" title="Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova">
<text>The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (, PCRM) is a communist party in Moldova led by Vladimir Voronin. It is the only communist party to have held a majority government in a post-Soviet state. It has been variously described as communist, Moldovenist, populist, Russophile, and pro-Soviet.

Affiliated with the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it is also a member of the Party of the European Left and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties. In contrast to most like-minded left-wing and communist parties, especially in the Western world, the party has a conservative outlook on social issues, reflecting Voronin&#x27;s views, the country&#x27;s strong social conservatism, and the influence of the Moldovan Orthodox Church.

== History ==
The PCRM was registered as a political party in 1994. The PCRM was part of the Popular Patriotic Forces Front at the time of the 1996 presidential election, in which Voronin stood as the coalition&#x27;s candidate and won 10.3% of the vote, placing third. The party supported Petru Lucinschi in the second round of the election, and following Lucinschi&#x27;s victory the PCRM was given two positions in the government. Romanian historian Dorin Cimpoeșu has described the party as Moldovenist.

=== 1998 parliamentary election ===
In the 1998 Moldovan parliamentary election, the PCRM won 30.1% of the vote and 40 seats, becoming the largest party in parliament; in its platform, it called for &quot;the rebirth of a socialist society&quot;. Despite its strong showing, the PCRM was left in opposition due to the formation of a center-right coalition government, Alliance for Democracy and Reforms (ADR). Although Lucinschi later nominated Vladimir Voronin as Prime Minister of Moldova in late 1999, the nomination was unsuccessful because Voronin did not have enough support in parliament.

=== 2001 parliamentary election ===
The PCRM received 49.9% of the vote in the 2001 Moldovan parliamentary election, winning 71 out of the 101 seats in parliament. With a PCRM parliamentary majority, Voronin was elected as president by parliament in April 2001. The Constitutional Court ruled that the President could also lead a political party, and Voronin was re-elected as party leader.

=== 2005 parliamentary election ===

As the ruling political party in Moldova, it won the 2005 Moldovan parliamentary election, and provided the President, Vladimir Voronin, the Prime Minister, Zinaida Greceanîi, and the President of the Moldovan Parliament, Marian Lupu. Under Voronin, it privatized several state-owned industries and governed in a multi-party fashion. It also favors European integration and eventual EU membership.

=== 2009 parliamentary elections ===

After April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election and the 2009 Moldova civil unrest, the political and civic climate in Moldova became very polarized. The parliament failed to elect a new president. For this reason, the parliament was dissolved and, consequently, snap elections were held. At the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election, the party received 44.7% of the vote. That gave the former ruling party 48 MPs and the remaining 53 seats in the 101-member chamber went to four opposition parties which subsequently formed the governing Alliance for European Integration (AIE). For the first time since 2001, the Communists were pushed in opposition.

=== 2010 parliamentary election ===
After the Parliament failed to elect a new President of the Republic, 2010 Moldovan parliamentary election were called. In the election, PCRM obtained 39.34% of votes, winning 42 seats, going again into opposition to the Alliance of European Integration (AIE). In 2011, Igor Dodon and Zinaida Greceanîi left the party and joined the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PSRM).

=== 2014 parliamentary election ===
The 2014 Moldovan parliamentary election saw a great defeat for PCRM, which received only 17.48% of votes, losing more than half of its electors to PSRM and electing 21 seats. Following the elections, the party agreed to give confidence and supply to the new Gaburici Cabinet. The agreement collapsed in June 2015 and the PCRM went back into opposition.

In 2016, the party suffered a large split as 14 MPS left PCRM faction and established the Social Democratic Platform for Moldova, joining the majority of Filip Cabinet. On 10 March 2017, all 14 MPs joined the Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM). Since then, the party rapidly declined in polls, losing most of its votes to PSRM and PDM.

=== 2019 parliamentary election ===
At the 2019 Moldovan parliamentary election, the PCRM collapsed, receiving only 3.75% of votes and losing all representation in the parliament for the first time in independent Moldova.

=== 2021 parliamentary election ===
At the 2021 Moldovan parliamentary election, the PCRM decided to join forces with the PSRM in order to re-enter the parliament as the Electoral Bloc of Communists and Socialists (BECS). The party won 10 out of 101 seats in the parliament as part of the aforementioned electoral bloc, thus regaining parliamentary presence after 2019.

== Ideology ==
According to Art. 1 of its statute adopted in 2008, the PCRM is the &quot;lawful successor and heir of the Communist Party of Moldova both in terms of ideas and traditions.&quot; While officially espousing a Marxist-Leninist communist doctrine, there is debate over their policies. In 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; considered it a centre-right party, communist-in-name only. Romanian political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu posits that the party is not communist in the classical sense because of the many changes since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but it is the clear successor to the Communist Party of Moldova, and not something foreign to it, for its Soviet nostalgia.

For its latest period of governance, the PCRM has outlined a new quality of life, economic modernisation, European integration, and consolidation of the society as goals for the country. During the party&#x27;s time in government, the party has adopted pro-Russian policies, while remaining committed to European integration. Despite being known for gaining most of its support from pensioners, since 2009 it also started to attract more votes from young people and adopting a populist outlook, which was downplayed during the PCRM&#x27;s time in government but has resurfaced at the opposition and extra-parliamentary level. In contrast to social populist parties, some of which combine left-wing policies on welfare with more right-wing nationalist stances, the PCRM is only marginally populist, and its main ideology continues to be Marxism–Leninism and European socialism.

The party is known for its Moldovenist position, supporting the existence of Moldovan language and ethnicity. The party considers 28 June 1940 as &quot;the day Moldova was liberated by the Soviet Union from the Romanian occupation&quot;. For these reasons, part of the press (such as journalist Oleg Serebrian) described the party as anti-Romanian.

== Moldovan Komsomol ==
The Communist Youth Union of Moldova (; ) was registered in 1995, currently including 6,000 members. According to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Moldova, it is the largest youth organization in the country. The First Secretaries of the Central Committee of the UTCM were the following: Victor Verșîn (1995-1997), Eduard Babliuc (1997-2000), Tatiana Nicoară (2000-2004), Grigore Petrenco (2004-2007), Inna Șupac (2007-present).

<text>The Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party (, SDKÚ-DS) is a liberal-conservative, Christian-democratic political party in Slovakia. The SDKÚ-DS was a member of the Centrist Democrat International and was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party until 2018, when it was expelled due to inactivity.

For 10 years, SDKÚ was a major centre-right political force in Slovakia. During their rule, Slovakia became member of the European Union and NATO, as well as put through economic reforms leading to the 00&#x27;s economic boom. The party lost its significance in the 2012 parliamentary election, when it received only 6% of votes. In the 2016 election, it lost rest of its MPs and received only 0.26% of votes. The party ran again in the 2023 election, receiving only 0,03% of votes. 

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1998, SDK was created as coalition of five small centre-right and centre-left parties intending to contest the Slovak parliamentary elections that year. The initial agreement was to form a party with 150 members and dissolve it after elections in 1998. After successful 1998 elections, SDK formed government with KDH, SDĽ and SMK-MKP. This initial agreement was not successful, and Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda (KDH) announced formation of new party - Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKÚ). Some SDK members joined the new party while others returned to their original parties. The new party was registered on 18 February 2000. On 18 November Constitution congress elected Mikuláš Dzurinda as chairman, vice chairmen being Edvard Kukan, Zuzana Martináková, Milan Kňažko and Ľubomír Harach. Gabriel Palacka became responsible for finances.

=== First time in government: 1998–2006 ===
After its creation, a majority of ministers of Slovak government were members of SDKÚ. SDKÚ was considered to be most reform oriented party. Its coalition partners were Party of the Hungarian Coalition, Party of Civic Understanding and Party of the Democratic Left.

In the 2006 Slovak parliamentary election, the party won 18.4% of the popular vote and 31 out of 150 seats in the National Council. Despite losing a large number of votes, the party was still able to form coalition government with former partners such as the Christian Democratic Movement, Party of the Hungarian Coalition and new party Alliance of the New Citizen. However, the opposition centre-left populist Smer-SD could able to form coalition with Slovak National Party and

=== Second time in government: 2010–2012 ===
For the 2010 parliamentary election, Dzurinda yielded the number-one slot on the party&#x27;s list to Iveta Radičová, though he remained party chairman. In this election, the party won 15.42% of popular vote corresponding to 28 seats in the National Council. Iveta Radičová become the first female prime minister in history of Slovakia, by forming a new centre-right coalition government consisted of SDKÚ-DS, SaS, MOST-HÍD and KDH. By custom, president Ivan Gašparovič first gave charge to form a new government to winning party SMER-SD and its leader Robert Fico, who was unable to do so due to Smer-SD and SNS only having 71 seats. The centre-right coalition Government collapsed on 11 October 2011 after lost confidence in parliament. Radičová subsequently decided not take candidacy in next elections and served as prime minister until a social democratic government took office on 4 April 2012.

=== 2012 election ===
Mikuláš Dzurinda led party to 2012 parliamentary election. The party was defeated badly, receiving just 6.09% of the votes and losing more than half of its seats. Dzurinda chose to resign from his position as the chairman of SDKÚ, and a party congress was held on 19 May 2012 so that a new leader could be chosen. Pavol Frešo, Lucia Žitňanská and Viliam Novotný were the candidates, Frešo finally won with 242 out of 404 votes. Lucia Žitňanská received 142 votes and announced she will not be a candidate for the position of vice-chairperson.

In the 2014 European elections, SDKÚ-DS came third place nationally, receiving 7.75% of the vote and electing 2 MEPs.

Out of 11 PMs elected in 2012 only 1 remained in the party as of 2015.

=== 2016 election ===
The party was led by Pavol Frešo. However, during the previous term SDKÚ-DS practically fell apart from inside, when its own members of parliament chose to leave the party. As a result, Frešo has a tough position and even if his campaign was led along with Slovak right-wing consensus against the SMER-SD party, it failed. While gaining only 0,27% of votes and losing 95% of its previous voters in the election of 5.3.2016, the party has received its worst result in history. SDKÚ-DS has won only in one village, Pavlovce in Rimavská Sobota District. Frešo has commented that SDKÚ-DS as the only party has defended openly pro-European ideas, opposing the building of fences against the immigrants in European migrant crisis. The chairman said that the situation was a big challenge for the presidium.

===Decline===
A party congress was held on 2 July 2016. Pavol Frešo stepped down from leadership of the party. New Vice-Chairmans were elected. The leader was expected to be elected later in 2016. It was reported in April 2018 that party de facto ceased to exist as it lacks membership and structure. The party was expelled from European People&#x27;s Party as a result. Igor Rattaj took over party&#x27;s property and became owner of Party&#x27;s trademark during September 2018. Rattaj stated that party is now only the Trademark and he will sell it if anyone expresses interest. Leader of the Party Milan Roman at the time ran for the position of Mayor in Skalice as an independent candidate.

===2023 election===

The party ran in the 2023 Slovak parliamentary election led by Branislav Rybárik. It received 771 votes (0,03%) and finished last. The party also ran in the 2024 European election, receiving 416 votes (0,03%) and again finishing last.

==Ideology==

SDKÚ-DS were a centre-right liberal conservative party, presenting itself as an alternative to the social-democratic and populist ideology of the Direction – Social Democracy (Smer-SD) party. After the general elections in 2010, SDKÚ-DS reached an agreement with other centre-right parties and formed the government of Slovakia. The party criticised the policies of Robert Fico&#x27;s Smer-SD party, calling them irresponsible, unsustainable and populist. SDKÚ-DS was the fifth largest party in the National Council during years 2012–2016. Its policy included continuing in reforms that took place before 2006, including tax reform, welfare benefits cuts, pensions reform, healthcare reform etc. SDKÚ-DS was then organised into four sections:

* Team for recovery and modernisation, led by Ivan Mikloš,
* Team for a dignified life, led by Iveta Radičová,
* Anti-crisis team, led by newcomer Eugen Jurzyca,
* Team for law and justice, led by Lucia Žitňanská.

The main partners of SDKÚ-DS were politically similar parties: Christian Democratic Movement, Freedom and Solidarity, and Most-Híd. Until 2012, these parties were in a coalition government with SDKÚ-DS.

<doc id="424642" wikidata="Q828392" url="?curid=424642" title="People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia">
<text>The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (, HZDS), later known as the People&#x27;s Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (, ĽS–HZDS), was a populist political party in Slovakia. The party is commonly considered as having been authoritarian and illiberal.

During 1992–1998, HDZS was the leading party of the government, led by Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. The party rule was characterized by a fundamental violation of civil liberties, rule of law and a halt to post-communist economic reforms, European integration.

After 1998 parliamentary election, the party remained in opposition for two terms still as the strongest party. In opposition, HZDS moved its positions from Euroscepticism to pro-Europeanism and joined European Democratic Party, although it did not profess EDP&#x27;s liberal ideology. In the 2006 parliamentary election, the party dropped to 5th place and became a junior partner in the Fico&#x27;s First Cabinet.

In 2010 parliamentary election the party did not exceed the electoral threshold narrowly for the first time, and this was repeated in 2012, when it won less than 1%. In 2014, HZDS officially dissolved and designated the Party of Democratic Slovakia as the successor.

==History==

===Velvet Revolution===
The party was created as a Slovak nationalist faction of Public Against Violence (VPN), from which it seceded at an extraordinary VPN congress on 27 April 1991. Called &#x27;Movement for a Democratic Slovakia&#x27; (HZDS), it was led by Vladimír Mečiar, who had been deposed as Slovak Prime Minister a month earlier, and composed mostly of the VPN&#x27;s cabinet members. The HZDS claimed to represent Slovak national interest, and demanded a more decentralised Czechoslovak confederation. On 7 May 1992, the HZDS voted for a declaration of independence, but this was defeated 73-57.

At the first election in which it took part, on 5–6 June, the HZDS won an overwhelming victory, with 74 seats on the National Council: two short of an absolute majority. Mečiar was appointed prime minister on 24 June. Whereas the HZDS wanted a confederation, the Czech elections on the same day were won by Civic Democratic Party, which preferred a tighter federation. Recognising that these positions were irreconcilable, the National Council voted for Slovakia&#x27;s Declaration of Independence by 113 votes to 24, and Mečiar concluded formal negotiations over the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

===Dominant party===
The party adopted an economically populist position, and sought to slow the post-Soviet privatisation and liberalisation.

In the first elections after independence, in late 1994, the HZDS retained its dominant position, winning 58 seats (the Peasant&#x27;s Party of Slovakia won a further 3 on its list).

===Decline in opposition===
Originally designating itself as a centre-left party, the party moved towards the mainstream right and, in March 2000, renamed itself the &#x27;People&#x27;s Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia&#x27; (ĽS-HZDS) to try to achieve membership of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). However, lingering memories of former anti-Europeanism, conflicting rhetoric, and the presence of three Slovak parties already in the EPP prevented this. The ĽS-HZDS then looked to the Euro-integrationist European Democratic Party, which it joined in 2009.

The build-up to the 2002 election saw Mečiar exclude a number of prominent members from the party&#x27;s list of candidates. Several of the excluded members, led by Ivan Gašparovič, split from the party and founded the similarly titled Movement for Democracy (HZD). The new party won 3.3% of the vote, eating significantly into the ĽS-HZDS&#x27;s position, and contributing to it winning only 36 seats. By 2006, further divisions and splits had reduced it to only 21 MPs.

===Back in government===
In the parliamentary election of 17 June 2006, the party won 8.8% of the popular vote and 15 out of 150 seats.

Two ĽS-HZDS ministers were sworn in with the Robert Fico government on July 4, 2006:

* Štefan Harabin (deputy prime minister; minister of justice);
* Miroslav Jureňa (minister of agriculture).

In the 2010 election the party lost all its seats, after its share of the vote halved to below the 5% threshold for entering parliament.

<text>Heinz Carl Heinrich Winckler (born 22 March 1978) is a South African singer and the winner of the first series of South African &quot;Idols&quot; and is also an actor.

Born the eldest of three children in Stellenbosch, South Africa, he went on to study law at Stellenbosch University. After winning the Idols competition in June 2002, he discontinued his studies to devote time to a music career.

== Idols ==
Idols was the South African version of the British &quot;Pop Idol&quot; show, and was presented as a talent search competition with successive elimination rounds narrowing the number of contestants. Throughout the show, Winckler was referred to as &quot;Hunky Heinz&quot; because of his good looks.

=== Songs performed on &quot;Idols&quot; ===
* Audition: &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, by Smash Mouth
* Top 50: &quot;Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot;, by Train

Winckler&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Once In A Lifetime&quot;, went double platinum in South Africa for having sold over 100,000 copies. His subsequent debut album, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, included this song as well as &quot;Soledad&quot;, a cover of the Westlife song which he performed during &quot;Idols&quot;, and &quot;Next Stop Happiness&quot;, which became a single as well.

He was nominated for two South African Music Awards, including best single for &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and best pop album for &quot;One Step Closer&quot;.

In 2003, with the inaugural &quot;World Idol&quot; competition, Winckler came fourth behind Belgium&#x27;s Peter Evrard (3rd), the US&#x27;s Kelly Clarkson (2nd), and Norway&#x27;s Kurt Nilsen (Winner).

His second album, &quot;Come Alive&quot;, was released via BMG, and features more ballads and rhythmic songs. It includes the singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Lose With You&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;, as well as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Miss A Thing&quot;. Also included are songs written by himself; &quot;Drowning Me&quot; is a track co-written by him.

He performed &quot;Chasing Shadows&quot;, the theme song for the South African release of the 2003 Disney movie &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;.

Heinz married Alette De Klerk on 25 September 2006 in South Africa. They have three sons and a baby girl.

In 2006, Heinz released his third studio album, &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;.

<text>In music theory, an augmented sixth chord contains the interval of an augmented sixth, usually above its bass tone. This chord has its origins in the Renaissance, was further developed in the Baroque, and became a distinctive part of the musical style of the Classical and Romantic periods.

Conventionally used with a predominant function (resolving to the dominant), the three most common types of augmented sixth chords are usually called the &quot;Italian sixth&quot;, the &quot;French sixth&quot;, and the &quot;German sixth&quot;.

==Augmented sixth interval==

The augmented sixth interval is typically between the sixth degree of the minor scale, , and the raised fourth degree, . With standard voice leading, the chord is followed directly or indirectly by some form of the dominant chord, in which both and have resolved to the fifth scale degree, . This tendency to resolve outwards to is why the interval is spelled as an augmented sixth, rather than enharmonically as a minor seventh ( and ). 

Although augmented sixth chords are more common in the minor mode, they are also used in the major mode by borrowing of the parallel minor scale.

==Types==
There are three main types of augmented sixth chords, commonly known as the &quot;Italian sixth&quot;, the &quot;French sixth&quot;, and the &quot;German sixth&quot;. 
Though each is named after a European nationality, theorists disagree on their precise origins and have struggled for centuries to define their roots, and fit them into conventional harmonic theory. According to Kostka and Payne, the other two terms are similar to the &quot;Italian sixth&quot;, which, &quot;has no historical authenticity-[being] simply a convenient and traditional label.&quot;

===Italian sixth===

The Italian sixth (It+6 or It6 or iv6) is derived from iv6 with an altered fourth scale degree, . This is the only augmented sixth chord comprising just three distinct notes; in four-part writing, the tonic pitch is doubled.
The Italian sixth is enharmonically equivalent to an incomplete dominant seventh. VI7=V7: A, C, (E,) G.

===French sixth===
The French sixth (Fr+6 or Fr) is similar to the Italian, but with an additional tone, . The notes of the French sixth chord are all contained within the same whole tone scale, lending a sonority common to French music in the 19th century (especially associated with Impressionist music), though they also make frequent appearances in Russian music.

This chord has the same notes as a dominant seventh flat five chord and is in fact the second inversion of II75.

===German sixth===
The German sixth (Ger+6 or Ger) is also like the Italian, but with an added tone, .

In Classical music, however, it appears in much the same places as the other variants, though perhaps less often because of the contrapuntal difficulties outlined below. It appears frequently in the works of Beethoven, and in ragtime music. The German sixth chord is enharmonically equivalent to a dominant seventh chord though it functions differently.

==== Avoiding parallel fifths ====
It is more difficult to avoid parallel fifths when resolving a German sixth chord to the dominant chord. These parallel fifths, referred to as &quot;Mozart fifths&quot;, were occasionally accepted by common practice composers. There are two ways they can be avoided:

===Other types===
Other variants of augmented sixth chords can be found in the repertoire, and are sometimes given whimsical geographical names. For example: 4–6–7–2; (F–A–B–D) is called by one source an &quot;Australian sixth&quot;, and 1- 2 - 4 - 6 (C - D - F - A ) sometimes called the &quot;Japanese sixth, Blackadder, or Ikisugi chord.&quot; Such anomalies usually have alternative interpretations.

==Function==
===Standard function===
From the Baroque to the Romantic periods, augmented sixth chords had the same harmonic function: as a chromatically altered predominant chord (typically, an alteration of ii, IV, vi7 or their parallel equivalents in the minor mode) leading to a dominant chord. This movement to the dominant is heightened by the semitonal resolution to from above and below (from and ); essentially, these two notes act as leading-tones.

During the Baroque and early Classical periods, for instruments tuned to meantone systems rather than well temperaments, the augmented sixth note (6) produced an excellent approximation to a harmonic seventh. The match is particularly close in quarter comma meantone, where 6 is only 3 cents flat from H. This made a major triad with an added 6 a fully consonant / harmonic chord (harmonics 4, 5, 6, 7); as opposed to a modern equal tempered dominant seventh chord (M add7) which misses being harmonic with the minor 7th pitch 31 cents sharp – a dissonance.

This characteristic has led many analysts to compare the voice leading of augmented sixth chords to the secondary dominant V of V because of the presence of , the leading-tone of V, in both chords. In the major mode, the chromatic voice leading is more pronounced because of the presence of two chromatically altered notes, and , rather than just .

In most occasions, the augmented-sixth chords precede either the dominant, or the tonic in second inversion. The augmented sixths can be treated as chromatically altered passing chords.

===Other functions===
In the late Romantic period and other musical traditions, especially jazz, other harmonic possibilities of augmented sixth variants and sonorities outside its function as a predominant were explored, exploiting their particular properties. An example of this is through the &quot;reinterpretation&quot; of the harmonic function of a chord: since a chord could simultaneously have more than one enharmonic spelling with different functions (i.e., both predominant as a German sixth and dominant as a dominant seventh), its function could be reinterpreted mid-phrase. This heightens both chromaticism by making possible the tonicization of remotely related keys, and possible dissonances with the juxtaposition of remotely related keys.

The French sixth sees a lot of non-functional use in much Russian music of the late-Romantic period. Due to its construction of two tritones separated by a major third, it has transpositional invariance and is often used to create tonal ambiguity in highly chromatic music of the 19th century. This use actually began in Germany with its use by Wagner and Bruckner (eg. the prelude from &quot;Tristan und Ysolde&quot; and Bruckner&#x27;s third symphony), but is most notable in Russian works such as Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherezade&quot; and Scriabin&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The chord is separated by only a single note from the half-diminished chord, or the &quot;Tristan chord,&quot; as well as the German sixth or dominant seventh. Tonal ambiguity is created by the French sixth as it is symmetrical about a tritone, for example, the notes of a French sixth chord built on G are the same as the notes as the chord built on C sharp, up to enharmonic equivalence. Due to this tonal ambiguity, the French sixth is often used in lieu of the triad and carries with it an unresolved and uneasy sound.

Scriabin also began to add chord extensions to the French sixth, for example, he added a sixth and a ninth to create his &#x27;mystic chord&#x27; which is found in his aforementioned &quot;Prometheus&quot; tone poem. The chord is usually combined with the octatonic, or diminished, scale, as the scale contains two distinct French sixths and thus has similar symmetric properties. This combination can be found ubiquitously in much of Rimsky and Scriabin&#x27;s music, as well as in some 20th century French works such as Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nuages&quot; and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Scarbo&quot;.

Tchaikovsky considered the augmented sixth chords to be altered dominant chords. He described the augmented sixth chords to be inversions of the diminished triad and of dominant and diminished seventh chords with a lowered second degree (), and accordingly resolving into the tonic. He notes that, &quot;some theorists insist upon [augmented sixth chord&#x27;s] resolution not into the tonic but into the dominant triad, and regard them as being erected not on the altered 2nd degree, but on the altered 6th degree in major and on the natural 6th degree in minor&quot;, yet calls this view, &quot;fallacious&quot;, insisting that a, &quot;chord of the augmented sixth on the 6th degree is nothing else than a modulatory degression into the key of the dominant&quot;.

The example below shows the last nine measures from Schubert&#x27;s Piano Sonata in A major, D. 959. In m. 352, an Italian sixth chord built on scale degree functions as a substitute for the dominant. 

==Inversions==
Augmented sixth chords are occasionally used with a different chord member in the bass. Since there is no consensus among theorists that they are in root position in their normal form, the word &quot;inversion&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily accurate, but is found in some textbooks, nonetheless. Sometimes, &quot;inverted&quot; augmented sixth chords occur as a product of voice leading.

Rousseau held that the chord could not be inverted. Seventeenth century instances of the augmented sixth with the sharp note in the bass are generally limited to German sources. 

The excerpt below is from J.S. Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor. At the end of the second measure, the augmented sixth is inverted to create a diminished third or tenth between the bass and the soprano (C–E); these two voices resolve inward to an octave.

== Related chords ==
In music theory, the double-diminished triad is an archaic concept and term referring to a triad, or three note chord, which, already being minor, has its root raised a semitone, making it &quot;doubly diminished&quot;. However, this may be used as the derivation of the augmented sixth chord. For example, F–A–C is a minor triad, so F–A–C is a doubly diminished triad. This is enharmonically equivalent to G–A–C, an incomplete dominant seventh A, missing its fifth), which is a tritone substitute that resolves to G. Its inversion, A–C–F, is the Italian sixth chord that resolves to G.

Classical harmonic theory would notate the tritone substitute as an augmented sixth chord on 2. The augmented sixth chord can either be (i) an It+6 enharmonically equivalent to a dominant seventh chord (with a missing fifth); (ii) a Ger+6 equivalent to a dominant seventh chord with (with a fifth); or (iii) a Fr+6 equivalent to the Lydian dominant (with a missing fifth), all of which serve in a classical context as a substitute for the secondary dominant of V.

All variants of augmented sixth chords are closely related to the applied dominant V7 of II. Both Italian and German variants are enharmonically identical to dominant seventh chords. For example, in the key of C, the German sixth chord could be reinterpreted as the applied dominant of D.

Simon Sechter explains the chord of the French sixth chord as being a chromatically altered version of a seventh chord on the second degree of the scale, . The German sixth is explained as a chromatically altered ninth chord on the same root but with the root omitted.

The tendency of the interval of the augmented sixth to resolve outwards is therefore explained by the fact that the A, being a dissonant note, a diminished fifth above the root (D), and flatted, must fall, whilst the F – being chromatically raised – must rise.
==Relationship between the different types==
The following &quot;curious chromatic sequence&quot;, graphed by Dmitri Tymoczko as a four-dimensional tesseract, outlines the relationships between the augmented sixth chords in 12TET tuning:

* Starting with a diminished seventh chord, lower any factor by a semitone. The result is equivalently to a German sixth chord.
* From the German sixth chord, lower any factor by a semitone so that the result is ancohemitonic (i.e.: possesses no half steps). The result is a French sixth chord or minor seventh chord possibly posing as a virtual augmented sixth.
* From the French sixth chord (or minor seventh chord posing as augmented sixth), there exists a factor which, when lowered by semitone, gives a result equivalent to a half-diminished seventh chord possibly posing as a virtual augmented sixth.
* From the half-diminished seventh chord as augmented sixth, there exists a factor which, when lowered by a semitone, is equivalent to a diminished seventh chord at the interval one semitone lower than the diminished seventh chord which started the sequence.
* Three repetitions of the above complete the cycle in modulo-12 note space, forming a necklace of three tesseracts joined at opposite corners by diminished seventh chords and subsuming all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.

===Minor seventh as virtual augmented sixth chord===
The minor seventh chord may also have its interval of minor seventh (between the root and seventh degree (i.e.: C–B in C–E–G–B) rewritten as an augmented sixth (C–E–G–A). Rearranging and transposing, this gives A–C–E–F, a virtual minor version of the German sixth chord. Again like the typical +6, this enharmonic interpretation gives a resolution irregular for the minor seventh but normal for the augmented sixth, where the two voices at the enharmonic major second converge to a unison or diverge to an octave.

===Half-diminished seventh as virtual augmented sixth chord===
The half-diminished seventh chord is the inversion of the German sixth chord (it is its inversion as a set, rather than as a chord). Its interval of minor seventh (between root and seventh degree (i.e.: C–B in C–E–G–B) can be written as an augmented sixth (C–E–G–A). Rearranging and transposing, this gives A–C–D–F, a virtual minor version of the French sixth chord. Like the typical +6, this enharmonic interpretation gives a resolution irregular for the half-diminished seventh but normal for the augmented sixth, where the two voices at the enharmonic major second converge to a unison or diverge to an octave.

==Tristan chord==

Richard Wagner&#x27;s Tristan chord, the first vertical sonority in his opera, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, can be interpreted as a half-diminished seventh that transitions to a French sixth in the key of A minor (F–A–B–D, in red below). The upper voice continues upward with a long appoggiatura (G to A). Note that the D resolves down to D instead of up to E:
