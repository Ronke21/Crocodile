<text>A laser turntable (or optical turntable) is a phonograph that plays standard LP records (and other gramophone records) using laser beams as the pickup instead of using a stylus as in conventional turntables. Although these turntables use laser pickups, the same as Compact Disc players, the signal remains in the analog realm and is never digitized.

==History==
William K. Heine presented a paper &quot;A Laser Scanning Phonograph Record Player&quot; to the 57th Audio Engineering Society (AES) convention in May 1977. The paper details a method developed by Heine that employs a single 2.2 mW helium–neon laser for both tracking a record groove and reproducing the stereo audio of a phonograph in real time. In development since 1972, the working prototype was named the &quot;LASERPHONE&quot;, and the methods it used for playback was awarded U.S. Patent 3,992,593 on 16 November 1976. Heine concluded in his paper that he hoped his work would increase interest in using lasers for phonographic playback.

===Finial===
Four years later in 1981 Robert S. Reis, a graduate student in engineering at Stanford University, wrote his master&#x27;s thesis on &quot;An Optical Turntable&quot;. In 1983 he and fellow Stanford electrical engineer Robert E. Stoddard founded Finial Technology to develop and market a laser turntable, raising $7 million in venture capital. In 1984 servo-control expert Robert N. Stark joined the effort.

A non-functioning mock-up of the proposed Finial turntable was shown at the 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), generating much interest and a fair amount of mystery, since the patents had not yet been granted and the details had to be kept secret. The first working model, the Finial LT-1 (Laser Turntable-1), was completed in time for the 1986 CES. The prototype revealed an interesting flaw of laser turntables: they are so accurate that they &quot;play&quot; every particle of dirt and dust on the record, instead of pushing them aside as a conventional stylus would. The non-contact laser pickup does have the advantages of eliminating record wear, tracking noise, turntable rumble and feedback from the speakers, but the sound is still that of an LP turntable rather than a Compact Disc. The projected $2,500 street price (later raised to $3,786 in 1988) limited the potential market to professionals (libraries, radio stations and archivists) and a few well-heeled audiophiles.

The Finial turntable never went into production. After Finial showed a few hand-built (and finicky) prototypes, tooling delays, component unavailability (in the days before cheap lasers), marketing blunders, and high development costs kept pushing back the release date. The long development of the laser turntable exactly coincided with two major events, the early 1980s recession, and the introduction of the Digital Compact Disc, which soon began flooding the market at prices comparable to LPs (with CD players in the $300 range). Vinyl record sales plummeted, and many established turntable manufacturers went out of business as a result.

With over US$20 million in venture capital invested, Finial faced a marketing dilemma: forge ahead with a selling price that would be too high for most consumers, or gamble on going into mass production at a much lower price and hope the market would lower costs. Neither seemed viable in a rapidly-shrinking market.

===ELP===
Finally, in late 1989 after almost seven years of research, Finial&#x27;s investors cut their losses and liquidated the firm, selling the patents to Japanese turntable maker CTI Japan, which in turn created ELP Japan for continued development of the &quot;super-audiophile&quot; turntable. After eight more years of development the laser turntable was finally put on sale in 1997 – twenty years after the initial proposal – as the ELP LT-1XA Laser Turntable, with a list price of US$20,500 (in 2003 the price was lowered to US$10,500).
The turntable, which uses two lasers to read the groove and three more to position the head, does allow one to vary the depth at which the groove is read, possibly bypassing existing record wear. It will not, however, read clear or colored vinyl records. ELP sells built-to-order laser turntables directly to consumers in two versions (LT-basic, and LT-master), at a reported cost (unpublished) of approximately $16,000 for the basic model.

===Optora===
In May 2018, Almedio of Japan, a computer drive manufacturer, presented the Optora ORP-1 optical (laser) turntable at the HIGH END Munich audio show. Few details were provided by the company because, like the 1984 presentation of the Finial turntable, the Optora was a non-working mockup. Company representatives indicated the turntable would use five lasers and be belt-driven, like the ELP. However, after producing some promotional materials (since deleted), a price was never announced and the Optora has not been put on the market. The company&#x27;s website devoted to the turntable has since been deleted.

== Performance==
In a 2008 review of the model ELP LT-1LRC, Jonathan Valin in &quot;The Absolute Sound&quot; claimed: 

Valin commended the tonal accuracy of playback, but criticized the lack of dynamic range and bass response (limitations of the vinyl records themselves). He emphasized that records must be wet-cleaned immediately before playback because: 

In 2008, Michael Fremer noted in &quot;Stereophile&quot;: 

Fremer also noted, however, that all of this comes at a cost: 

Fremer concludes: 

==Optical record scanning==
A similar technology is to scan or photograph the grooves of the record, and then reconstruct the sound from the modulation of the groove revealed by the image. Research groups that developed this technology include:
* IRENE developed by physicists Carl Haber and Vitaliy Fadeyev of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Installed in the Library of Congress late in 2006, IRENE (for Image, Reconstruct, Erase Noise, Etc.) uses a camera rotating around the record and taking detailed photographs of the grooves. Software then uses the digital images to reconstruct the sound. In 2018 the system was used to play, for the first time, the only known recording of Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s voice. IRENE often produces a large amount of hiss with the recording, but it is very capable of removing pops and clicks produced by imperfections on the record surface.
* SAPHIR system developed at INA in 2002 (patented in France in 2004).
* VisualAudio developed by the Swiss National Sound Archives and the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg.
* A laser beam reflection method was developed by Japanese scientists in Hokkaido university in 1986 for the purpose of reading audio recordings of the Ainu language made on fragile wax cylinders.

<text>Edison Laser Player (ELP) Japan is a Japanese audio equipment company started by Sanju Chiba, who manufacture laser turntables.

The origin of ELP&#x27;s turntable came from an American company named Finial Technologies, led by Michael Stoddard, who designed a prototype unit for playing vinyl using laser technology in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, this coincided with the commercial rise of the CD, so Finial went into receivership and sold the rights to ELP in 1989.

The units are custom built to order - a typical price in the mid-2000s was about $11,000 to $15,000. The turntable uses a combination of five lasers, which point in different directions of the groove in a vinyl record to ensure a steady signal is picked up. Because of laser technology, loading and unloading a vinyl record is similar to the process used in most high end CD players.

The lack of mechanical components means it is far more capable of playing records, even those with scratches and warps, and it also allows direct track selection like a CD, along with the ability to change pitch in smaller increments, which is physically impossible using CD technology. 

One notable disadvantage of the laser technology used is that it will not play clear or colored vinyl, which was sometimes used for novelty singles and promotional material. Another is that while the technology allows for superior sound pickup, it also “reads” all dust and dirt in the grooves rather than pushing it aside, so clicks and pops can become much more pronounced. A thorough and frequent cleaning of the vinyl is therefore required.

<text>The music of Malawi has historically been influenced by its triple cultural heritage of British, African, and American music. Malawians, known for their history as travellers and migrant workers, have contributed to the spread of their music across the African continent, blending it with various musical forms. A significant factor in this musical amalgamation was World War II, during which soldiers transported music to distant lands and brought it back, leading to the popularity of guitar and banjo duos as dance bands by the war&#x27;s end. Both instruments were imported. Additionally, Malawians working in mines in South Africa and Mozambique influenced the fusion of music styles, giving rise to genres such as Kwela.

In the colonial period, Malawi witnessed the emergence of a few well-known singers. Notable among them was Tony Bird, a folk-rock singer-songwriter born in Nyasaland, whose music blended Malawian and Afrikaner traditions. His popularity led to tours with Ladysmith Black Mambazo in the 1980s.

Under President Hastings Banda, the Malawian state censored music deemed sexually or politically subversive. This policy limited the international recognition of artists between 1964 and 1994. Following the first multiparty elections in 1994, artists gained the freedom to express themselves publicly, fostering the growth and development of Malawian music into the diverse forms heard today.

Since 1994, the country has experienced steady growth in its music industry and local celebrities. Due to past suppression, many emerging artists are young, with figures like Young Kay receiving support from industry veterans, contributing to the evolution of Malawian music.

Internationally, numerous Malawian artists have gained recognition. Notable names include Wambali Mkandawire, Erik Paliani, Lucius Banda, Tay Grin, Esau Mwamwaya, Tsar Leo, and Lawrence Khwisa (LULU). In a historic moment, Malawian music received recognition at the 58th Grammy Awards in 2015 with the nomination of Zomba Prison Project&#x27;s &quot;I Have No Everything Here&quot; for Best World Music Album.

==Music of Malawi==

=== Kwela Music ===
In the late 1960s, South African kwela music was popular in Malawi. The country produced its own Kwela stars that were not as popular as the South African counterparts, but contemporary Kwela artists like Daniel Kachamba &amp; His Kwela Band have enjoyed popularity. South African Kwela music was first created by Malawian immigrants who, upon moving to South Africa, fused their music with local sounds. The word, &#x27;Kwela&#x27;, in Chichewa means &#x27;to climb&#x27; which is similar to the South African definition, which means to &quot;get up&quot; or &quot;rise&quot;.

===Malawian jazz===
Malawian jazz bands also became popular. In spite of the name, Malawian jazz has little in common with its American namesake. Rural musicians played acoustic instruments, often in very traditional ways. These performers include Jazz Giants, Linengwe River Band, Mulanje Mountain Band and Chimvu Jazz. By the beginning of the 1970s, electric guitars had become common and American rock and roll, soul and funk influences the music scene, resulting in a fusion called afroma. New Scene, led by Morson Phuka, was the most well-known exponent of afroma.

Contemporary Malawian jazz artists include Wambali Mkandawire, South Africa based Ray Phiri and US-based Masauko Chipembere Jr.

Jazz concerts can be seen throughout Malawi. Many Malawian Jazz bands perform regularly at local hotels and clubs. Sunday Jazz is a popular event in many lodges and hotels in Malawi, where it is a social event for people in the suburban areas to meet and listen to Jazz music on Sundays.

===Malawian kwasa kwasa===
Influenced by the 1980s music from the Congo, Malawi&#x27;s own kwasa kwasa music grew. The 1980s saw soukous from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then &quot;Zaire&quot;) become popular, and result in a Malawian variety called kwasa kwasa.

=== Malawian hip-hop/rap ===

Since 1994, rap has surged in Malawi from urban centers such as Blantyre and Lilongwe to rural areas as Nkhata Bay or Chitipa. Rap scenes in Malawi has been connected through nationwide institutional networks of radio and newspapers. Hip Hop culture from the United States, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the Caribbean arrived through satellite television and video cassettes.

Real Elements,is the first Malawian music group to record Malawian urban music. who brought to Malawi an urban American sound with chichewa lyrics. They were featured on Channel O and performed in Malawi and opened in the UK for hip hop artists like Blak Twang. They inspired a new genre of Malawian music in the form of the urban hip-hop and rap music styles that was uniquely Malawian.

Since the days of the Real Elements, the Malawian hip-hop genre has grown. This includes Young Kay, Third Eye a.k.a. Mandela Mwanza, Phyzix, Dominant 1, Incyt, Cyclone, A.B, The Basement, Pittie Boyz, The Daredevilz, Lomwe, the Legendary Barryone, Nthumwi Pixy, Biriwiri, Renegade &amp; Pilgrim, Jay-T Pius Parsley as well as international stars like Tay Grin, Gwamba, South African based St Bosseratti.

The hip-hop scene in Malawi continues to evolve with new school artists like Gwamba and Martse. Home Grown African, Tsar Leo and Lxrry are some of the different hip-hop acts that are making news as part of the new school, but with an international appeal to their music. &quot;Rap and ragga&quot; competitions sponsored by private organizations are a common showcase for young performers.

English is the most used language in Malawi rap music, including in newspaper articles, discussions among youths, and radio broadcasts. However, for certain situations, Chichewa is considered the most appropriate language.

===Malawian gospel music===
Gospel music is one of Malawi&#x27;s most popular music forms. It became popular in the 1990s. Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1989 visit did much to inspire the rise in gospel music, which was also fueled by the country&#x27;s economic conditions and poverty. Popular Malawian gospel artists include Ndirande Anglican Voices, Ethel Kamwendo-Banda, Grace Chinga, Lloyd Phiri, George Mkandawire, and the Chitheka Family.

As some secular artists become &#x27;born again&#x27;, Malawi has seen a rise in the diversification of gospel music, particularly in the urban genre. Early hip-hop rappers include Chart Rock and The Strategy. Currently, David (formerly Stix from Real Elements, KBG, the founder of NyaLimuziK, and Gosple (Aubrey Mvula) are now the leaders in this form of gospel rap.

As we continue analysing the impact and growth of gospel hip hop or urban music, we cannot just go without mentioning two other up-coming members in this section; based in Lilongwe, the popularly known area 18 youthful crew, the Brothers In Christ (BIC) and the King of Malawi Gospel House beatz DJ Kali have taken the spreading of the gospel to greater heights.

=== Malawian R&amp;B ===
Malawi&#x27;s genre R&amp; B is growing and has been made popular with artists like Maskal, Theo Thomson, Sonye and Dan Lu. There has also been other new upcoming Artists like, Kumbu, Bucci, and Kell Kay, Tremone Trun.

=== Malawian reggae ===
Reggae has always been popular in Malawi. Malawian reggae has become immensely popular in recent years, especially amongst the Malawian Rastafarians and along the tourist-filled lakefront.

==== Lucius Banda, Evison Matafale and Mlaka Maliro ====
Individual artists such as Lucius Banda, Mlaka Maliro and Evison Matafale helped to bring the Malawian music scene on the national and international scene. There are also various growing roots rock reggae bands playing their own international standard music such as Fostered Legacy, Soul Raiders, and Wailing Brothers whom their contributions to music has been outstanding. The Malawian reggae music has been music of resistance and of struggle. Many of the themes in the music center around injustice, corruption and equality for all people of Malawi.

Mtafale formed a music group the Black Missionaries that became one of the most popular reggae bands in Malawi.

=== Malawian traditional music and dances ===
Traditional Malawian music has also found some commercial success, such as the folk fusionists Pamtondo, whose music uses rhythms from the Tumbuka, Lomwe, Makuwa and Mang&#x27;anja peoples. There have also been more traditionalist performers and banda, like Alan Namoko, Micheal Yekha, Ndingo brothers, Millennium Sound Checks and Waliko Makhala. In Malawi traditional dances include Manganje, Mganda, Tchopa, Beni, Malipenga, Ngoma, Chitelera, Likwata, Chiwoda, Masewe, Chimtali, Visekese, Khunju, Gule wa Mkulu and Chisamba.

=== Malawian pop/fusion ===
Malawian artists have been known to creatively mix rock, r&amp;b, and the American urban sound to create vibrant fusion music. One such artist is Esau Mwamwaya whose music fuses traditional Malawian, pop and urban sounds.

== Music production ==
Before 1968, recordings in Malawi were made by mobile recording studios, and by the Federal Broadcasting Studios in Lusaka, Zambia. Nzeru Record Company (NRC), established in 1968, was the first recording studio in Malawi. However, the studio disappeared in 1972 due to a limited local market.

Between 1972 and 1989, most of the recordings were made in the studios of Radio Malawi, later called the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation. As the broadcaster was controlled by the government, the studios helped to filtrate music. Music was recorded in open-reel tapes and never was released on vinyl.

In 1988, the liberalization of the economy and the establishment of the Copyright Act of 1988 allowed entrepreneurs to found their own studios. At the end of the 1990s, small independent studios spread in Blantyre, Balaka, and Lilongwe.

The Church in Malawi opened Andiamo Studios, where the Christian Alleluya Band recorded its first album on cassette in 1988. In 1991, Alleluya Band&#x27;s guitarist Paul Banda started Imbirani Yahwe Studios in Balaka Town. Since then, most of the Musicians in Malawi expect to have their own recording studio. For that reason, it&#x27;s hard to find professionally-run recording studios in the country and record labels often have short lives. In some cases, music projects in Malawi are recorded by multiple studios.

Blantyre is the home of most Malawi recording studios. Young musicians interested in recording their song will record in recording studios which offer accessible options for recording a single (generally, one copy of the song) and then give them to a deejay with the hope they play the song on the air.

==Music festivals==

* In 2004, Englishman Will Jameson started Lake of Stars Music Festival which has international artists and Malawians performing together. It currently has been voted by the British newspapers The Independent and the Times as one of the top 20 Music festivals in the world.
* Since the advent of Lake of Stars, Malawi has seen a myriad of festivals pop up, some longer lived than other. 
* Sand Fest 
* Tumaini is a free festival organised in Dzaleka refugee camp. 
* 2021 Saw the first edition of Zomba City Festival after cancelling the previous year due to Corona. Zomba City Festival is an annual event, taking place on Labour Day weekend. Zomba City Festival aims to showcase the attractivity of Zomba to its visitors.

<doc id="426565" wikidata="Q1854417" url="?curid=426565" title="List of destroyers of the United States Navy">
<text>This is a list of [[destroyers]] of the United States Navy, sorted by hull number. It includes all of the series DD, DL, DDG, DLG, and DLGN.

CG-47 &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and CG-48 &quot;Yorktown&quot; were approved as destroyers (DDG-47 and DDG-48) and redesignated cruisers before being laid down; it is uncertain whether CG-49 &quot;Vincennes&quot; and CG-50 &quot;Valley Forge&quot; were ever authorized as destroyers by the United States Congress (though the fact that the DDG sequence resumes with DDG-51 &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; argues that they were).

==Destroyer types listed==
; DD : Destroyer
; DL : Destroyer Leader (later Frigate) (retired)
; DDG : Destroyer, Guided Missile
; FFG : Frigate, Guided Missile (abolished 30 June 1975)
; FFGN : Frigate, Guided Missile, Nuclear-Propulsion (abolished 30 June 1975)

===Other destroyer types===
These destroyer types are listed in other articles.

* DE: Destroyer escorts: 
:List of destroyer escorts of the United States Navy

* DM: Destroyer minelayers: 

* DMS: Destroyer minesweepers: 

* APD: High-speed transports, destroyers converted to land Marines ashore: 

* AVD: Destroyer seaplane tenders: 

==Destroyer leaders==

The DL category was established in 1951, with the abolition of the experimental CLK category. CLK-1 became DL-1 and DDs 927–930 became DLs 2–5. By the mid-1950s the term destroyer leader had been dropped in favor of frigate. The DLG sequence was deactivated in the 1975 fleet realignment, most DLGs and DLGNs were reclassified as CGs and CGNs, 30 June 1975. However, DLG 6–15 became DDG 37–46. DL-1 through DL-5 had been decommissioned prior to this time; DLG-6 &quot;Farragut&quot; through DLG-15 &quot;Preble&quot; became DDG-37 through DDG-46. DLG-16 &quot;Leahy&quot; through DLGN-40 &quot;Mississippi&quot; became CG-16 through CGN-40.

==Guided missile destroyers==

The guided missile destroyer sequence has three irregularities: four DDGs are numbered as if they were Destroyers in the main sequence (DDG-993, -994, -995 and -996), two were redesignated as guided missile cruisers (CG) (DDG-47 and DDG-48), and two numbers were skipped (DDG-49 and DDG-50). The picks up at DDG-1000.

<doc id="426566" wikidata="Q319366" url="?curid=426566" title="Galle">
<text>Galle (; ) (formerly ) is a major city on the southwestern tip of Sri Lanka, south of Colombo. Galle is the provincial capital and largest city of Southern Province, Sri Lanka and is the capital of Galle District.

Galle was known as &quot;Gimhathiththa&quot; before the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, when it was the main port on the island. Ibn Batuta, a Moroccan Berber Muslim traveller in the 14th century, referred to it as &quot;Qali&quot;. Galle reached the height of its development in the 18th century, during the Dutch colonial period. Galle is the best example of a fortified city built by the Portuguese in South and Southeast Asia, showing the interaction between Portuguese architectural styles and native traditions. The city was extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. The Galle fort is a World Heritage Site and is the largest remaining fortress in Asia built by European occupiers.

Other prominent landmarks in Galle include the city&#x27;s natural harbour, the National Maritime Museum, St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral founded by Jesuit priests, one of the main Shiva temples on the island, and Amangalla, the historic luxury hotel. On 26 December 2004, the city was devastated by the massive tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia a thousand miles away. Thousands were killed in the city alone. Galle is home to the Galle International Stadium, which is considered to be one of the most picturesque cricket grounds in the world. The ground, which was severely damaged by the tsunami, was rebuilt and test matches resumed there on 18 December 2007.

Important natural geographical features in Galle include Rumassala in Unawatuna, a large mound-like hill that forms the eastern protective barrier to Galle Harbour. Local tradition associates this hill with some events of Ramayana, one of the great Hindu epics. The major river in the area is the Gin Ganga, which begins from Gongala Kanda, passes villages such as Neluwa, Nagoda, Baddegama, Thelikada and Wakwella, and reaches the sea at Gintota. The river is bridged at Wakwella by the Wakwella Bridge.

==Etymology==
Galle was known as &quot;Gimhathitha&quot; in ancient times. The term is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese term meaning &quot;port near the River Gin&quot;. It is believed that the town got its name as &quot;Gaalla&quot; in the native tongue as a result of the large number of bullock carts that took shelter in the area, following the long slow journeys from remote areas of the island. &quot;Gaala&quot; in Sinhala means the place where cattle are herded together; hence the Sinhalese name for Galle, ගාල්ල, is a development from &quot;Gaala&quot;. Another theory is that the word &quot;Galle&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;gallus&quot; or the Portuguese word &quot;galo&quot;, which mean &#x27;rooster&#x27;. The Dutch used the rooster as a symbol of Galle.

== History ==
According to James Emerson Tennent (Colonial Secretary of Ceylon) Galle was the ancient seaport of Tarshish, from which King Solomon drew ivory, peacocks and other valuables. Cinnamon was exported from Sri Lanka as early as 1400 BC, and as the root of the word itself is Hebrew, Galle may have been a main entrepôt for the spice.

Ancient Greek and Roman geographers may have known about Galle, which they might have called the Cape of Birds. Ptolemy might also have known about the port which he referred to as Odoka. Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta visited Galle (or Qali as he called it) in 1342. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Sinhalese refugees fleeing Tamil armies from the north began to settle in Galle and other nearby areas.

Galle had been a prominent seaport long before western rule in the country: Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Malays, Indians, and Chinese were doing business through Galle&#x27;s port. In 1411, the Galle Trilingual Inscription, a stone tablet inscription in three languages, Chinese, Tamil and Persian, was erected in Galle to commemorate the second visit to Ceylon by the Chinese admiral Zheng He. In 1502, a small fleet of Portuguese ships, under the command of Lourenço de Almeida on their way to the Maldives, were blown off course by a storm. Realising that the King resided in Kotte close to Colombo, Lourenço proceeded there after a brief stop in Galle.

In 1640, the Portuguese were forced to surrender to the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch built the present fort in 1663. They built a fortified solid granite wall and three bastions, known as &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;.

After the British took over the country from the Dutch in 1796, they preserved the fort unchanged and used it as the administrative centre of the district.

==Climate==
Galle features a tropical rainforest climate. The city has no true dry season, though it is noticeably drier in the months of January and February. As is commonplace with many cities with this type of climate, temperatures show little variation throughout the course of the year, with average temperatures hovering at around throughout.

The last appointed mayor was Methsiri De Silva, who served from 2009 to 2016. The mayoral system has been dissolved the Galle administration, with the city presently administered by a commissioner. The main vision of the city is &quot;Building of moderate city through the supply of relatively increased utility services to the citizens who pay taxes to the Galle Municipal Council&quot;. The other vision is to brand Galle as &quot;Green City-Green Galle&quot; to create and promote Galle as one of Sri Lanka&#x27;s cool and healthy coastal cities with a clean green canopy.

<text>Joseph Montgomery (1733–1794) was an American Presbyterian minister and a delegate to the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==

Joseph was born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on October 3, 1733. The area at that time was part of Lancaster County.

His parents, John and Martha (Finley) Montgomery, had immigrated from Ireland. One known sibling is &quot;Nancy&quot; Agnes Montgomery (Mrs. Alexander McCorkle) who is buried Thyatira Presbyterian Church Cemetery, Rowan County, N.C., and whose son, a nephew of Joseph Montgomery, was also a noted Presbyterian divine: Dr Samuel Eusebius McCorkle (Princeton baccalaureate, Dickinson College Doctorate of Divinity). Montgomery was on his mother&#x27;s side related to 1761-1766 Princeton President, Samuel Finley (1715–66).

Joseph Montgomery attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and graduated in 1755. After a brief time as a school master, he began the study of theology. In 1760 he earned an A.M. degree from the College of Philadelphia (now part of the University of Pennsylvania) and began a ministerial career, serving at several churches in Pennsylvania.

==Career==

In 1769 he was made pastor of a congregation in New Castle, Delaware, and continued there until 1777, when he joined the 1st Maryland Regiment of the Continental Army as a chaplain. He served with Colonel William Smallwood&#x27;s unit for two years and was in major actions at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth, as well as the winter at Valley Forge.

During his service, his wife (Elizabeth Reed) and two young daughters made their home with his relatives back at Paxtang (Harrisburg), and he returned there when discharged at the end of 1778. He was sent as one of the Pennsylvania delegates to the Continental Congress on November 23, 1780, and served there until 1782. In 1782 and 1783 he was elected to the State Assembly. In February 1783 he also served on a commission to settle title disputes arising from Connecticut and Pennsylvania grants near Wyoming, Pennsylvania.

When Dauphin County was organised in 1785, he became a judge in its court of common pleas, as well as the recorder of deeds and register of wills. He held these positions until his death.

==Private life==

On 11 July 1770 he married Rachel Rush, a sister of Dr. Benjamin Rush. Rachel Rush (widow of Angus Boyce) Montgomery was born 18 October 1741 and died 28 July 1798 in Harrisburg, PA. John Montgomery was born in 1771 to Rachel Rush and Joseph Montgomery. In his later years he made his home with his daughter, Elizabeth Montgomery Laird, and her family in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. When he died in Harrisburg on October 14, 1794, he was buried in their family plot in the Lutheran Church Cemetery.

<text>Clarence Decatur Howe (15 January 1886 – 31 December 1960) was an American-born Canadian engineer, businessman and Liberal Party politician. Howe served as a cabinet minister in the governments of prime ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent continuously from 1935 to 1957. He is credited with transforming the Canadian economy from agriculture-based to industrial. During the Second World War, his involvement in the war effort was so extensive that he was nicknamed the &quot;Minister of Everything&quot;.

Born in Massachusetts, Howe moved to Nova Scotia as a young adult to take up a professorship at Dalhousie University. After working for the Canadian government as an engineer, he began his own firm and became wealthy. In 1935, he was recruited as a Liberal candidate for the House of Commons of Canada by Mackenzie King. The Liberals won the election in a landslide and Howe won his seat. Mackenzie King appointed him to the Cabinet. There, he took major parts in many new enterprises, including the founding of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Trans-Canada Air Lines (today Air Canada). Howe played a crucial role in Canada&#x27;s war effort during WWII and recruited many corporate executives (as &quot;dollar-a-year-men&quot;) to serve as executives in wartime enterprises.

Howe was impatient with parliamentary debates for his proposals, causing him to struggle with gaining popularity amongst parliamentarians; he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe came to be seen as arrogant. The Government&#x27;s attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe&#x27;s actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22 years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships, and died suddenly of a heart attack in December 1960.

== Early years and academic career ==
Howe was born on 15 January 1886 in Waltham, Massachusetts, United States. The Howes were well-regarded in the local community, and William Clarence Howe, Clarence&#x27;s father, was involved in local politics and descendant of Puritans arriving in 1630s. When not doing political work, William Howe was a carpenter and house builder. Clarence&#x27;s mother, Mary Emma ( Hastings) was a teacher and the daughter of a prosperous farmer on whose farm Clarence spent his childhood summers. His mother was related to naval hero and US Navy Commodore Stephen Decatur.

Clarence did well in school and, upon his graduation from Waltham High School in 1903, passed the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He took basic courses at the school and did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J. B. Worcester &amp; Co., a firm that constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Howe accepted the job, partly because unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.

At the time, Dalhousie was a small university, with only 400 students, and members of the teaching staff had a heavy workload. Howe, at age 23, was little older than some of his students. He had little experience in the field, and on trips outside Halifax, he and his students would solve problems together. Howe&#x27;s view was that any problem could be solved through common sense and hard work. Howe took his students to the countryside, where they camped, surveying and planning imaginary railroads. His student Denis Stairs, who would go on to lead the Montreal Engineering Company, said of Howe that by the time the camp ended, his students had great respect for him. Student C. J. Mackenzie, who Howe would later appoint to the National Research Council presidency, stated that Howe was not a brilliant lecturer, but that his presentations were always extremely clear. Howe later said of university education, &quot;The worker at college continues to work, and becomes a successful engineer. The shirker continues to shirk, and gets nowhere.&quot; In addition to his work, Howe found time for an active social life in Halifax, and considered marrying the sister of one of his students, but she had another husband in mind.

After Howe&#x27;s first year in Halifax, engineering instruction of upperclassmen was taken away from Dalhousie. Howe later stated that he liked Dalhousie, and had this change not occurred, he might have remained there as a professor. In 1913, a former colleague at Dalhousie, Robert Magill, who had recently been appointed chairman of the Board of Grain Commissioners, offered Howe the post of chief engineer, with responsibility for supervising the construction of grain elevators. Howe stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen one of those things in my life, but I&#x27;ll take the job.&quot; The same year, he applied to become a British subject, as Canadians then were.

== Engineer and businessman ==
In mid-1913, Howe journeyed to Northwestern Ontario to take up his new post. The Board was headquartered in Fort William, Ontario, where Canadian wheat was transferred from rail to ship. The Board sought to build a series of large terminal grain elevators, which could process as well as store grain. The project would increase both capacity and competition—grain elevator companies had been accused by farmers&#x27; interests of charging excessive prices. The first such elevator for the Board was raised in nearby Port Arthur, Ontario, and was acclaimed as one of the best grain elevators ever built in Canada, and one of the cheapest. Over the next two years, Howe traveled the West, supervising the construction of terminal elevators near major cities and ports. The capacity would be needed, as Canadian farmers increased production during the First World War.

In late 1915, Howe traveled back to Massachusetts to court Alice Worcester, daughter of the head of the company he had worked for in the summer at MIT. After some surprise at the attention of a man she barely knew, Worcester eventually accepted him, and the two were married in mid-1916. The same year, he resigned from government service to go into business with partners as C. D. Howe and Company, whose major business was initially the construction of grain elevators. Both the company headquarters and the marital home were in Port Arthur. Howe&#x27;s first contract was to build a grain elevator in Port Arthur. In December 1916, a massive storm destroyed the half-built elevator, wiping out Howe&#x27;s assets. Had his bank not come to his assistance with additional funds, he would have been ruined. When Howe turned over the completed elevator to the owner, the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, he was asked how badly he had done on the contract, and stated, &quot;I lost my shirt.&quot; The Association voted him a bonus to make up for his loss.

Over the next several years, Howe&#x27;s business expanded into engineering consulting and, much more profitably, general contracting. His firm dominated the construction of grain elevators in the West, as the Saskatchewan and Alberta wheat pools gave him much of their construction business. This made him unpopular among private wheat companies: his firm did not receive any contracts to build terminal elevators for private corporations in the 1920s, but exceeded the number built by all other contractors combined, thanks to business from those cooperatives. Howe&#x27;s elevators were built more quickly, were better designed, and were cheaper to construct than those of his competitors. He worked to add to their efficiency; the Dominion-Howe unloader he helped design emptied a grain car in eight minutes, needing only two operators; the same operation had previously taken an hour for a crew of 20 men.

In the early 1920s, Howe turned down several requests to stand for alderman in Port Arthur. He did agree to seek election to the school board in 1921, and headed the polls at his first attempt. He served two 2-year terms on the board, spending the final year as its chairman. Early in their marriage, Clarence and Alice Howe had decided to separate their roles, with Alice having full responsibility for their domestic lives. Clarence took no interest in his home life; as an often-absent father he had only a small role in the upbringing of his five children. In the same manner he did not involve his wife in his business (or, later public) life. During his ministerial career, he replied in response to an opposition question hinting at nepotism, &quot;I don&#x27;t like to discuss my family in public. Members may have noticed that &quot;my&quot; wife never appears on political platforms.&quot;

In October 1929, the firm completed a huge grain elevator, with the capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no demand for more grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe&#x27;s company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe&#x27;s sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, and he decided to pursue a new career.

== Politics ==

=== Election and prewar ===
In 1933, the Liberal Party was in opposition and considered Howe as a potential candidate for the House of Commons in the upcoming election. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other and, according to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur. Mackenzie King accepted this deal and on 14 October 1935, Howe was comfortably elected to the Commons from Port Arthur, amassing a majority of 3,784. Across the country, the Liberals won a landslide victory, with 173 seats in the House of Commons to the Conservatives&#x27;s 40. Mackenzie King appointed Howe to two portfolios: Minister of Railways and Canals and the first Minister of Marine. Howe was the only engineer in Cabinet, which was dominated by lawyers, and was the first engineer to serve in a Liberal government.

After Parliament assembled in early 1936, Howe sought to have it pass legislation to reform local port authorities. Individual ports were run by Boards of Harbour Commissioners, appointments to which were often politically influenced. A Royal Commission in 1932 had recommended the positions be abolished, and Howe&#x27;s bill was to establish a National Harbours Board. The debate in the House went smoothly until Howe angered the opposition by declaring that, during Bennett&#x27;s government, the Conservatives had been corrupt. Despite what became a much more bitter debate, Howe&#x27;s bill carried. According to Leslie Roberts in his biography of Howe, &quot;This was the Howe the country would soon come to know much better, the Howe on the rampage, the Howe who is impatient of criticism and deplores the debates and delays inherent in the parliamentary system.&quot;

Howe worked to place the government-dominated Canadian National Railways (CNR) on a sound financial basis and introduced legislation to form the CNR into a crown corporation. Although the opposition complained that Howe was becoming power-mad, they had little quarrel with the proposed reorganization itself, and it was passed into law. In June 1936, Howe brought in legislation to establish another crown corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which passed into law with little debate or opposition. Howe also worked to increase airline coverage in Canada; in 1936, many Canadians wishing to fly long distances by air would journey through the United States. The Liberals proposed legislation to establish a government-financed corporation, with half the stock to be owned by the CNR and half by the privately owned Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The CPR balked at the deal, and the remaining stock was taken up by the CNR and Trans-Canada Air Lines was founded in May 1937. For the rest of his political career, Howe kept Trans-Canada Air Lines in his ministerial portfolio, considering it his &quot;progeny and generally promoted its interests&quot;.

=== Second World War ===
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, starting WWII. Mackenzie King recalled Parliament into session beginning 7 September; during this session, Canada declared war on Germany and created a Department of Munitions and Supply. It was some months before the department was established; in the meantime Howe supervised the War Purchasing Board. Howe worked to persuade many of his business contacts to work for him or for other government departments. Roberts suggests that no &quot;political minister&quot; could have done that, as many of Howe&#x27;s recruits were Conservatives. According to historian and author Michael Bliss, &quot;[f]or Howe and other entrepreneurial spirits interested in the creative uses of government power, the war was a kind of ultimate megaproject, a great development job. Money didn&#x27;t matter, production did.&quot;

In the 1940 election, Howe had little trouble being re-elected, and 184 Liberals were returned to Ottawa, the greatest total by any party to that point. Mackenzie King appointed Howe as Minister of Munitions and Supply. Liking his job at Transport, Howe was reluctant to move, but the Prime Minister persuaded him. The function of the new department was the complete mobilization of all Canadian resources to support the war effort. Howe initially retained the Transport portfolio as well; on 8 July 1940, he turned over responsibility for that portfolio to Arthur Cardin, although Howe retained control of the CBC and Trans-Canada Air Lines.

Howe&#x27;s department was assisted by &quot;dollar-a-year men&quot;, top managers in Canadian business loaned to the government by their companies for a token payment of one dollar a year while their firms maintained them on their payrolls. Even before the department was formally established, Howe&#x27;s representatives were surveying the country for essential war needs, with the department accumulating huge reserves of strategic materials. During the Second World War, Howe established 28 Crown Corporations of various responsibilities including secret projects and manufacturing the machine tools the rest of Canadian industry needed to continue operations. These corporations were responsible to Howe and Parliament received no word of their activities unless Howe mentioned them.

With Canadian industry reorganized to supply the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S. &quot;Western Prince&quot; in December 1940. This was an intensely dangerous trip; Germany was attempting to blockade Britain and there were many German submarines in the North Atlantic. One of those submarines sank the &quot;Western Prince&quot; on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship. Howe professed coolness in the incident, but later told the Manchester &quot;Guardian&quot; that he considered every hour that he lived from that day onwards to be borrowed time.

While on tour of British industrial plants, Howe was shown the Avro Lancaster four-engined heavy bomber, which he subsequently championed for Canadian production. On his return, Howe expropriated the troubled National Steel Car Ltd. plant which was beset with management problems, setting up Victory Aircraft Limited as a Crown corporation, removing the executives and installing J. P. Bickell, one of Howe&#x27;s &quot;dollar-a-year club&quot; as the new president and chairman of the board. Victory Aircraft recovered its momentum and went on to become one of Howe&#x27;s greatest industrial successes, producing Avro aircraft under license, including the Lancaster.

According to Roberts, &quot;What Howe started in 1940 was an Industrial Revolution, so widespread that most Canadians were unaware of its extent or of its penetration into the country&#x27;s economy.&quot; Although there had been increases in production throughout the first three years of the war, the minister&#x27;s efforts truly bore fruit in 1943, in which Canada had the fourth-highest industrial production among the Allies, trailing only the US, USSR, and Britain. By 1944, Canada had produced over 600 ships for the war effort, 1,100 aircraft, and over half a million cars and trucks, of which 31,000 were armoured. According to Roberts, Howe&#x27;s actions swung Canada&#x27;s economy from agriculture-based to industrial, a change that became permanent.

==== &quot;What&#x27;s a million?&quot; ====
During the debate on Howe&#x27;s war spending estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365 billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: &quot;I dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill would not be a very important matter.&quot; Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, &quot;We may save a million dollars, but what of it?&quot; Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being &quot;a past master of distortion&quot;—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, &quot;What&#x27;s a million?&quot; Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of thing he could have said. In the years to come, &quot;What&#x27;s a million?&quot; would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.

=== Postwar ===

==== Mackenzie King years ====
In October 1944, Mackenzie King appointed Howe Minister of Reconstruction. Howe had an excellent reputation for his successful overhaul of the Canadian economy, and Mackenzie King feared he would return to the private sector to amass another fortune in business. Among those who urged Howe to remain was the Minister of Justice, Louis St. Laurent, with whom Howe forged a strong relationship. The Prime Minister obtained a dissolution of Parliament in April 1945 and in the ensuing election, the Liberals obtained a bare majority. Howe was intensively involved in Liberal fundraising, and campaigned nationally for its candidates. He was easily returned in Port Arthur, taking just over half of all votes cast, with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (the predecessor of the New Democratic Party) a distant second.

Howe favoured a quick transition to a peacetime economy. Most industries in which there were no shortages were released from government controls in late 1945. Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe on a golf course, the minister stated, &quot;R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is up to you. Get the hell off of the course.&quot; In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored since the end of the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, &quot;although he worked to return the country&#x27;s economic power to private hands, he often seemed as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament&quot;. In November 1945, Howe&#x27;s wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.

Howe was determined to support technologically advanced industries and wanted Canada to continue the production of aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer and that despite the presence of manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).

After the war, Mackenzie King recommended to the British government that two Cabinet ministers be appointed to the Imperial Privy Council, but not Howe. When the honours were announced on New Year&#x27;s Day 1946, Howe told the Prime Minister that he felt his war service was being slighted and threatened his resignation. Mackenzie King arranged for Howe to receive the honour in June. This created more ill feelings among other members of the Cabinet; two more were elevated in the 1947 New Year&#x27;s Honours, after which the Prime Minister refused to consider any more.

In February 1947, Mackenzie King fell ill with pneumonia and, after recovering, spent a month on vacation in the United States, with St. Laurent (by then Secretary of State for External Affairs) as Acting Prime Minister. In July, Minister of National Defence Brooke Claxton warned Mackenzie King that the issue of the Prime Minister&#x27;s age and the uncertainty of the succession was causing political difficulties for the Liberals. Mackenzie King consulted Howe, who bluntly stated that it was best that Mackenzie King resign while still retaining his full faculties and before a crisis erupted. After the talk, the Prime Minister decided that he should retire within a year and that St. Laurent, who had recently threatened to leave Cabinet and return home to Quebec, should be the successor. Howe was among those who persuaded St. Laurent not to resign. He also helped persuade St. Laurent to stand for the leadership, offering to remain in Cabinet to assist him following his withdrawal.

==== St. Laurent government&#x27;s first mandate====
On 20 January 1948, Mackenzie King announced his intent to resign and a Cabinet reshuffle; both St. Laurent and Howe convinced the Prime Minister to move Howe, who had not enjoyed his work at the Ministry of Reconstruction and Supply, to become Minister of Trade and Commerce. Howe publicly announced that he was &quot;not available&quot; to stand for the leadership and that he was supporting St. Laurent. The Quebecer was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in August, and Mackenzie King resigned on 15 November. 

In October 1948, the Progressive Conservatives also elected a new leader, Ontario Premier George A. Drew. St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and Howe again was successful in fundraising from corporate backers, including CPR and Eaton&#x27;s. Drew had used Howe&#x27;s record as an election issue, accusing him of being power-mad and selling off Crown Corporations for bargain prices, but the allegations got little traction. According to Howe, the only result of Drew&#x27;s attacks &quot;was to give me a record majority in Port Arthur!&quot; The Liberals won a huge victory, taking 190 seats to 40 for the Tories, and Howe again won Port Arthur easily.

In early 1950, St. Laurent considered recommending the appointment of Howe as governor general. The governor general had previously been a British peer; many nationalists wanted a Canadian to hold the post, and St. Laurent agreed. The governor general, The Viscount Alexander, was due to retire by 1953. St. Laurent saw this as a way of allowing his friend and colleague to step away from politics for a quieter life. The minister was willing to take the post, but the position unexpectedly opened early when Alexander was appointed to the British Cabinet. Howe decided he still had work to do as a minister and was reluctant to exchange real power for the nominal power of the governor generalship. St. Laurent recommended the appointment of Canadian-born Vincent Massey, who was duly appointed by King George VI.

Canada entered the Korean War in 1950. Howe saw it as the wrong war in the wrong place, and thought that Canadian troops should not be sent. Nevertheless, he spent the summer of 1950 at his desk, making plans to implement government controls on the booming economy. In September 1950, Howe tabled a bill allowing him to reallocate scarce materials such as steel from the civilian sector to military use. The bill passed, but not before the Opposition had charged that Howe had &quot;an enormous appetite for power&quot;. Late in the year, the Government decided on a massive rearmament program. The Canadian Commercial Corporation, the Crown Corporation which handled government purchases, was felt to be inadequate for the task, so the Cabinet decided on a new department to handle procurement. St. Laurent introduced a bill in February 1951 creating a Department of Defence Production and announced that on passage, Howe would add that responsibility to his portfolio. The opposition parties objected to the Defence Production Act, stating that there was no emergency justifying the powers Howe wanted. According to Roberts, Howe sought to implement rearmament by getting &quot;full power for himself and running rights over everyone and everything to get an urgent job done&quot;. Backed by the overwhelming Liberal majority, the bill passed and the Department was established on 1 April 1951.

Despite Avro Canada&#x27;s success in producing the CF-100, Canada&#x27;s first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), aircraft development had proven to be a time-consuming and expensive process. The projected next generation aircraft, Canada&#x27;s first supersonic jet interceptor, the CF-105 Arrow, was a more daunting project in terms of financial commitment and a leap in technological prowess. Howe wrote in a letter to Defence Minister Claxton in 1952 that &quot;I am frightened for the first time in my defence production experience.&quot;

St. Laurent&#x27;s supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, &quot;Who would stop us? Don&#x27;t take yourself too seriously. If we wanted to get away with it, who would stop us?&quot; 

The government spent much of early 1953 in enacting the remainder of its legislative program. St. Laurent scheduled an election for 10 August; Drew attempted to exploit a Defence Ministry scandal at the Petawawa, Ontario army base, where an investigation earlier in the year had found frauds which included placing horses on the payroll. The Liberals lost 20 seats from their 1949 high-water mark, but still constituted almost two-thirds of the House of Commons, and no minister was defeated. Howe was again easily elected for Port Arthur.

==== St. Laurent government&#x27;s second mandate ====
Beginning in 1954, Howe planned for pipelines to take Alberta&#x27;s natural gas to market. There were US-backed proposals to build pipelines directly to the United States; Howe wanted a route passing north of the Great Lakes which could supply Toronto and Montreal. Two rival groups contended for the approval which Howe had the power to grant; Howe forced the groups to work together on the route he wanted.

In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled legislation to make the Department of Defence Production permanent and extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after the first day of debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister &quot;the virtual dictator of the economy&quot;. With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, &quot;utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition&quot;. When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he &quot;was out on a limb for $30 million&quot;, which gave him &quot;the shudders&quot;, the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of &quot;What&#x27;s a million?&quot; In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister&#x27;s powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe&#x27;s absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister&#x27;s decision, he accepted it. Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying &quot;That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I&#x27;ve more to do with my time than amusing Parliament.&quot; The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.

The pipeline project was wracked with financing difficulties. The pipeline company wanted the Government to guarantee the loans needed to build what would become known as the Trans-Canada Pipeline, but Cabinet refused, fearful of the political implications of giving a large sum of government money to a US-dominated corporation. Howe was embittered by this decision, and grumbled that he was now part of &quot;a government which has fallen into the hands of children&quot;. A solution was proposed by Howe&#x27;s deputy minister, Mitchell Sharp: the Government and the province of Ontario would themselves build the most expensive part of the route, in Northern Ontario, to be reimbursed by Trans-Canada once the pipeline was open for business. This was approved by both governments. By 1956, however, further difficulties had arisen: until the US government granted formal approval for a part of the route which connected to US pipelines, Trans-Canada could not raise enough money to build its portion. The approval was a matter of routine, but the delay would mean that construction on the pipeline could not begin until the spring of 1957.

Howe was determined that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed with both to the proposal and to the use of rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.

Bothwell and Kilbourn describe Howe&#x27;s speech opening the Pipeline Debate as &quot;probably the best of his career&quot;. He told the Commons that waiting a year would be imprudent, given the worldwide shortage of steel pipe, and unfair to those who owned natural gas wells in western Canada, which were presently capped. Howe told the House he believed this to be a great project, &quot;of truly national scope, which we must either launch now or see languish for years to come.&quot; He completed his address by giving notice that the following day, the Government intended to invoke closure. Social Credit, with many members from Alberta, supported the bill, while the Tories and CCF engaged in weeks of bitter debate and parliamentary wrangling. This culminated on 1 June, dubbed by the Tories &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when Speaker René Beaudoin reversed a ruling he had made the previous evening which would have allowed the Opposition to continue the debate past the deadline. The Opposition accused the Speaker of yielding to Government pressure. The bill passed within the deadline, and construction on the pipeline began immediately. Howe wrote, &quot;I should not like to face a general election at this moment. Fortunately we do not have to.&quot;

In mid-1956, Drew fell ill and resigned as Tory party leader. The leadership convention&#x27;s choice of Diefenbaker as Drew&#x27;s replacement prompted delight in some Liberal circles. Diefenbaker had long been a maverick within his party, was little known in eastern Canada, and many deemed him unelectable. Although Defence Minister Claxton and the RCAF remained firm supporters of the Arrow program as costs continued to rise, in 1957 the Cabinet&#x27;s defence committee proposed elimination of the Arrow, a decision that was to be reviewed after the forthcoming election and which was supported by Howe.

==== 1957 election ====
After the election was called in April 1957 for 10 June, Howe raised sufficient money to enable the Liberals to heavily outspend their opponents. As there were few Liberal ministers from western Canada, Howe was called upon to make appearances throughout the region. He found that the Manitoba Farmers Union was organizing opposition to the Liberals; at some meetings Howe had difficulty getting heard at all. At other meetings, Howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members. On 19 May in Morris, Manitoba, Howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting, he could ask all the questions he wanted; the man was the head of a local Liberal association. When asked why he did not answer Mackenzie&#x27;s question, Howe replied, &quot;Look here, my good man, when the election comes, why don&#x27;t you go away and vote for the party you support? In fact, why don&#x27;t you just go away?&quot; At another meeting, Howe was asked why he did not care about the farmers&#x27;s economic plight. He responded, &quot;Looks like you&#x27;ve been eating pretty well under a Liberal government&quot; and poked the questioner in the midsection.

Diefenbaker used the Pipeline Debate as a major theme in the campaign, one which he mentioned more than any other issue. In Vancouver, he told the largest political crowd in the province since 1935, &quot;I give this assurance to Canadians—that the government shall be the servant and not the master of the people ... The road of the Liberal party, unless it is stopped—and Howe has said, &#x27;Who&#x27;s going to stop us?&#x27;—will lead to the virtual extinction of parliamentary government. You will have the form, but the substance will be gone.&quot;

Howe was opposed in his riding by CCF candidate Doug Fisher, a local high school teacher. Fisher&#x27;s campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, and a number of corporate enemies Howe had made throughout his political career. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station to explain his opposition to the Liberals and his party&#x27;s proposals—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher&#x27;s appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn &quot;treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice young fellow that they had been seeing on television for the last couple of months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him.&quot; Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher&#x27;s hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect&#x27;s mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. In the general election, the Tories took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105 for the Liberals. St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.

== Later life, death, and legacy ==
Howe returned to Ottawa after his defeat, cleared his office, and soon sold his house there, moving to Montreal. After St. Laurent announced his retirement in September, Howe wrote to the former Prime Minister, &quot;The young men of the party must take on the job of reorganising and rebuilding, and perhaps the sooner they get at it the better.&quot; While publicly taking no position, Howe privately supported former External Affairs Minister Pearson for the Liberal leadership, and Pearson won the contest in January 1958. Howe advised Pearson not to take any action that might provoke an election. Pearson did not heed Howe and challenged Diefenbaker as soon as Parliament met. The election on 31 March returned the Progressive Conservatives in a record landslide, which left the Liberals with 48 seats. Howe, who took no part in the campaign, had already left for Europe with his wife, Alice, on an extended holiday. On his return, he did what he could to help rebuild the Liberal Party after the disaster, assisting with fundraising and seeking to unite factions within the party.

After some hesitancy that was likely caused by fears the newly empowered Tories would resent any approach to their longtime enemy, major corporations began to approach Howe and ask for him to serve on their boards of directors. In 1958, Howe was made chancellor of Dalhousie University. On investigating the university&#x27;s finances, he found that a professor&#x27;s salary in 1958 had less buying power than when he had worked there. Howe urged increased salaries and building improvements to attract first-rate scholars to the university. He also accepted a number of honorary degrees from other universities.

Howe had a longtime heart condition, and friends urged him to give up all boards that did not meet in Montreal. Before he could act on this suggestion, Howe suffered a heart attack and died at his home on 31 December 1960.

Prime Minister Diefenbaker said after Howe died, &quot;We often had strong differences but our personal relations remained most friendly at all times ... He gave his great ability, indomitable courage and energy to his country in a manner that has earned for him and will assure him of a large place in the history of Canada&#x27;s war effort.&quot; Opposition Leader Pearson stated, &quot;He was a man who shirked no duty, faltered in no task, was daunted by no obstacle. He got things done, and they were good things for the country he served so well and so long.&quot; At his memorial service, enemies and friend alike gathered. Among the eulogies delivered by friends and colleagues at Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal, it was remarked that Howe often stated proudly that he was &quot;an American by birth but Canadian by choice&quot;.

Howe had five children:

* William (Bill) Hastings Howe
* John Howe
* Barbara Stewart Marshall
* Mary Dodge
* Elisabeth Howe Stedman

== Namesakes ==
After Howe&#x27;s death, the C. D. Howe Memorial Foundation was created in his memory; the C. D. Howe Institute, a Canadian economic policy think tank was at one time associated with the Memorial Foundation. The Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute (CASI) introduced the C. D. Howe Award for achievements in the fields of planning and policymaking, and overall leadership in the field. In 1976, Howe was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame, in honour of his contribution to creating a national airline and efforts to create and sustain a viable aviation industry. The C. D. Howe Building, located at Bank and Sparks Street in Ottawa, is the home of Industry Canada and is named for the former minister, as is a public school in Thunder Bay in the Lakehead District School Board. The former Department of Transport and Canadian Coast Guard vessel was named for him.

<text>The New Mexico Legislature () is the legislative branch of the state government of New Mexico. It is a bicameral body made up of the New Mexico House of Representatives and the New Mexico Senate.

==History==

The New Mexico Legislature was established when New Mexico officially became a state and was admitted to the union in 1912. 
In 1922, Bertha M. Paxton became the first woman elected to the New Mexico Legislature, serving one term in the House of Representatives.

==Session structure and operations==
The Legislature meets every year, in regular session on the third Tuesday in January. The New Mexico Constitution limits the regular session to 60 calendar days, every other year it is 30 days. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate, while the Speaker of the House is elected from that body in a closed-door majority-member caucus. Both have wide latitude in choosing committee membership in their respective houses and have a large impact on lawmaking in the state.

While only the Governor can call the Legislature into special sessions, the Legislature can call itself into an extraordinary session. There is no limit on the number of special sessions a governor can call. The New Mexico Constitution does not limit the duration of each special session; lawmakers may consider only those issues designated by the governor in the &quot;call,&quot; or proclamation convening the special session (though other issues may be added by the Governor during a session).

Any bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor takes effect 90 days after its passage unless two-thirds of each house votes to give the bill immediate effect, earlier effect (before 90 day period), or later effect (after 90 day period).

==Compensation==
New Mexico does not pay its legislators a base salary. Legislators receive per diem of $191 per day for work at the capitol or committee hearings and mileage reimbursement at the federal rate of 67 cents per mile. They can receive a per diem outside of legislative session.

==Qualifications==
The state constitution requires representatives to be at least twenty-one years old and senators to be at least twenty-five, and members of both houses must live in the districts they represent.

==Districting==
The legislature consists of 70 representatives and 42 senators. Each member of the House represents roughly 25,980 residents of New Mexico. Each member of the Senate represents roughly 43,300 residents. Currently the Democratic Party holds a majority in both of the chambers of New Mexico Legislature, and holds the Governor&#x27;s office.

===Redistricting===
In 2021, Senate Bill 304 established the Citizen Redistricting Committee. The committee is to develop three redistricting plans to recommend to the Legislature for each of the following: U.S. House of Representatives, New Mexico House of Representatives, New Mexico Senate, and any other state offices requiring redistricting. As of the summer of 2021, the latter consisted of only the New Mexico Public Education Commission. The Legislature is still free to make its own redistricting plans.

===Term limits===
Currently, there are no term limits for legislators. The longest current member of the legislature has served since 1972. House members are elected every two years, while Senate members are elected every four years.

<text>Vermilion (sometimes vermillion) is a color family and pigment most often used between antiquity and the 19th century from the powdered mineral cinnabar (a form of mercury sulfide). It is synonymous with red orange, which often takes a modern form, but is 11% brighter (at full brightness).

==Etymology and common name==
Used first in English in the 13th century, the word &quot;vermilion&quot; came from the Old French word &quot;vermeillon&quot;, which was derived from &quot;vermeil&quot;, from the Latin &quot;vermiculus&quot; the diminutive of the Latin word &quot;vermis&quot; for worm. 

The name originated because it had a similar color to the natural red dye made from an insect, &quot;Kermes vermilio&quot;, which was widely used in Europe. The first recorded use of &quot;vermilion&quot; as a color name in English was in 1289. 

The term cinnabar is used in mineralogy and crystallography for the red crystalline form of mercury sulfide HgS. Thus, the natural mineral pigment is called &quot;cinnabar&quot;, and its synthetic form is called &quot;vermilion&quot; from red lead.

==Chemistry and manufacture==
Vermilion is a dense, opaque pigment with a clear, brilliant hue. The pigment was originally made by grinding a powder of cinnabar (mercury sulfide). Like most mercury compounds, it is toxic.

Vermilion is not one specific hue; mercuric sulfides make a range of warm hues, from bright orange-red to a duller reddish-purple that resembles fresh liver. Differences in hue are caused by the size of the ground particles of pigment. Larger crystals produce duller and less orange hues.

Cinnabar pigment was a side product of the mining of mercury, and mining cinnabar was difficult, expensive, and dangerous, because of the toxicity of mercury. Greek philosopher Theophrastus of Eresus (371–286 BC) described the process in &quot;De Lapidibus&quot;, the first scientific book on minerals. Efforts began early to find a better way to make the pigment.

The Chinese were probably the first to make a synthetic vermilion as early as the fourth century BC. Greek alchemist Zosimus of Panopolis (third–fourth century AD) wrote that such a method existed. In the early 9th century, the process was accurately described by Persian alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (722–804) in his book of recipes of colors, and the process began to be widely used in Europe.

The process described by Jabir ibn Hayyan was fairly simple:
* Mix mercury with sulfur to form &quot;aethiopes mineralis&quot;, a black compound of mercury sulfide.
* Heat this in a flask (the compound vaporizes and recondenses in the top of the flask).
* Break the flask.
* Collect the vermilion and grind it.
When first created, the material is almost black. As it is ground, the red color appears. The longer the compound is ground, the finer the color becomes. Italian Renaissance artist Cennino Cennini wrote: &quot;If you were to grind it every day, even for 20 years, it would keep getting better and more perfect.&quot;

In the 17th century, a new method of making the pigment was introduced, known as the Dutch method. Mercury and melted sulfur were mashed to make black mercury sulfide, then heated in a retort, producing vapors condensing as a bright, red mercury sulfide. To remove the sulfur, these crystals were treated with a strong alkali, washed, and finally ground under water to yield the commercial powder form of the pigment. The pigment is still made today using essentially the same process.

Vermilion has one important defect; it is liable to darken, or develop a purplish-gray surface sheen. Cennino Cennini wrote, &quot;Bear in mind ... that it is not in its character to be exposed to air, but it is more resistant on panel than on walls since, when it is used and laid on a wall, over a period of time, standing in the air, it turns black.&quot; Newer research indicates that chlorine ions and light may aid in decomposing vermilion into elemental mercury, which is black when in finely dispersed form.

Vermilion was the primary red pigment used by European painters, from the Renaissance until the 20th century. Because of its cost and toxicity, though, it was almost entirely replaced by a new synthetic pigment, cadmium red, in the 20th century. As cadmium can also be toxic, some scientists propose replacing this with solid solutions of the perovskites CaTaO2N and LaTaON2.

Genuine vermilion pigment today comes mostly from China; it is a synthetic mercuric sulfide, labeled on paint tubes as PR-106 (Red Pigment 106). The synthetic pigment is of higher quality than vermilion made from ground cinnabar, which has many impurities. The pigment is very toxic, and should be used with great care.

==History==
The colors are widely used in the art and decoration of Ancient Rome and the Byzantine Empire, then in the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, in the paintings of the Renaissance, and in the art and lacquerware of China.

===Antiquity===
The first documented use of vermilion pigment, made with ground cinnabar, dates to 8000–7000 BC, and was found at the neolithic village of Çatalhöyük, in modern-day Turkey. Cinnabar was mined in Spain beginning in about 5300 BC. In China, the first documented use of cinnabar as a pigment was by the Yangshao culture (5000–4000 BC), where it was used to paint ceramics, to cover the walls and floors of rooms, and for ritual ceremonies.

The principal source of cinnabar for the ancient Romans was the Almaden mine in northwest Spain, which was worked by prisoners. Since the ore of mercury was highly toxic, a term in the mines was a near-guaranteed death sentence. Pliny the Elder described the mines this way:

Nothing is more carefully guarded. It is forbidden to break up or refine the cinnabar on the spot. They send it to Rome in its natural condition, under seal, to the extent of some ten thousand librae (Roman pounds thus 3289 kg) a year. The sales price is fixed by law to keep it from becoming impossibly expensive, and the price fixed is seventy sesterces a pound.

In Rome, the precious pigment was used to paint frescoes, decorate statues, and even as a cosmetic. In Roman triumphs, the victors had their faces covered with vermilion powder, and the face of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill was also colored vermilion. Cinnabar was used to paint the walls of some of the most luxurious villas in Pompeii, including the Villa of the Mysteries (Italian: &quot;Villa dei Misteri).&quot; Pliny reported its painters stole a large portion of the expensive pigment by frequently washing their brushes and saving the wash water.

In the Byzantine Empire, the use of cinnabar/the vermilion color was reserved for the use of the imperial family and administrators; official letters and imperial decrees were written in vermilion ink, made with cinnabar.

===In South Asia===
It is known as sindoor. Sindoor is commonly used by married women in Hindu religion.

===In the Americas===
Vermilion was also used by the native peoples of America, to paint ceramics, figurines, and murals, and for the decoration of burials. It was used in the Chavin civilization (400 BC – 200 AD), and in the Maya, Sican, Moche, and Inca empires. The major source was the Huancavelica mine in the Andes mountains in central Peru.

The most dramatic example of vermilion use in the Americas was the so-called Tomb of the Red Queen, located in Temple XIII, in the ruins of the Mayan city of Palenque in Chiapas, Mexico. The temple is dated to between 600 and 700 AD. It was discovered in 1994 by Mexican archeologist Fanny López Jiménez. The body and all objects in the sarcophagus were covered with bright red vermilion powder made from cinnabar.

===In the Middle Ages and Renaissance===
The technique for making a synthetic vermilion by combining sulfur and mercury was in use in Europe in the 9th century, but the pigment was still expensive. Since it was almost as expensive as gold leaf, it was used only in the most important decoration of illuminated manuscripts, while the less expensive minium, made with red lead, was used for the red letters and symbols in the text.

Vermilion was also used by painters in the Renaissance as a very vivid and bright red, though it did have the weakness of sometimes turning dark with time. Florentine artist Cennino Cennini described it in his handbook for artists:

By the 20th century, the cost and toxicity of vermilion led to its gradually being replaced by synthetic pigments, particularly cadmium red, which had a comparable color and opacity.

===Chinese red===
In China, the color vermilion was also playing an important role in national culture. The color was mostly used in creating Chinese lacquerware, which was exported around the world, giving rise to the term &quot;Chinese red&quot;.

The lacquer came from the Chinese lacquer tree, or &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot;, a relative of the sumac tree, which grew in regions of China, Korea, and Japan. The sap or resin of the tree, called urushiol, was caustic and toxic (it contained the same chemical compound as poison ivy), but painted onto wood or metal, it hardened into a fine natural plastic, or lacquer surface. The pure sap was dark brown, but beginning in about the third century BC, during the Han dynasty, Chinese artisans colored it with powdered cinnabar or with red ochre (ferric oxide), giving it an orange-red color. Beginning in about the 8th century, Chinese chemists began making synthetic vermilion from mercury and sulfur, which reduced the price of the pigment and allowed the production of Chinese lacquerware on a larger scale.

The shade of red of the lacquerware has changed over the centuries. During the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD) the Chinese word for red referred to a light red. However, during the Tang dynasty (618–907), when the synthetic vermilion was introduced, that color became darker and richer. The poet Bai Juyi (772–846) wrote in a song poem praising Jiangnan, &quot;the flowers by the river when the sun rises are redder than flames&quot;, and the word he used for red was the word for vermilion, or Chinese red.

When Chinese lacquerware and the ground cinnabar used to color it were exported to Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, European collectors considered it to be finer than the European vermilion. In 1835, &quot;Chinese vermilion&quot; was described as a cinnabar so pure that it only had to be ground into powder to become a perfect vermilion. Historically, European vermilion often included adulterants including brick, orpiment, iron oxide, Persian red, iodine scarlet—and minium (red lead), an inexpensive and bright, but fugitive lead-oxide pigment.

Since ancient times, vermilion was regarded as the color of blood, thus the color of life. It was used to paint temples and the carriages of the emperor, and as the printing paste for personal seals. It was also used for unique red calligraphic ink reserved for emperors. Chinese Taoists associated vermilion with eternity.

===Religion===

* The Shaolin temple, where Buddhist monk Bodhidharma is reputed to have established the new sect of Chan Buddhism (Zen Buddhism), is colored a bright tone of vermilion. This temple was featured in the West by the 1972–1975 TV series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;.
* In the Bible, vermilion is listed as a pigment that was in use for painting buildings during the reign of Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, and is named in the book of the prophet Ezekiel as a pigment used in art that portrayed Chaldean men. (Jeremiah 22:11–14, Ezekiel 23:14–17)
* The vermilion rose is a symbol of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
* Hindu women use vermilion along the hair parting line known as &quot;sindoor&quot;, to signify that they are married. Hindu men and women often wear vermilion on their foreheads during religious ceremonies and festivals.
* In Shintoism, Torii Gates which mark the entrances to sacred spaces, as well as the columns and eaves of shrines, are traditionally painted vermilion to ward off evil.

===Mythology===
* In Han China&#x27;s Five Elements cosmology (cf. Chinese mythology), one of the four symbols of the four directions is a bird called Vermilion Bird, which represents the direction of south. The color red (particularly as exemplified by cinnabar/vermilion) was also symbolically associated with summer, fire, a certain note on the musical scale, a certain day of the calendar, etc.

===Literature===
* &quot;Vermilion Sands&quot; is a collection of science-fiction short stories by J. G. Ballard published in 1971 about an imaginary future resort that pleases its guests by using various kinds of futuristic technology.
* &quot;Manfred&quot;, a short dramatic poem by Lord Byron: &quot;...With the azure and vermillion / which is mixed for my pavilion&quot;

===Music===
The Dutch singer Simone Simons, released her debut solo album called &quot;Vermillion&quot; in 2024. On this album, the word vermillion was used for one of the song titles called &quot;Vermillion Dreams&quot; and also the album was called vermillion.

===Video games===
* Vermilion City is one of the locations used in the English-translated versions of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games and anime. It is a port town in the Kanto area, and the name is derived from the original Japanese name クチバシティ (Kuchiba City). Kuchiba is an orange-red color associated with sunsets and autumnal leaves and &quot;Vermilion&quot; was used as an approximate translation.

==Variations==
===Red-orange===

The Crayola color red-orange has been a Crayola color since 1930.

===Orange-red===
The web color orange-red was formulated in 1987 as one of the X11 colors, which became known as the X11 web colors after the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991.

===Medium vermilion===
This color is the medium tone of vermilion called vermilion on the Plochere color list, which was formulated in 1948 and is used widely by interior designers.

===Chinese red===
Chinese red or China red is the name used for the vermilion shade used in Chinese lacquerware. The shade of the color can vary from dark to light depending upon how the pigment is made and how the lacquer was applied. Chinese red was originally made from the powdered mineral cinnabar, but beginning in about the 8th century it was made more commonly by a chemical process combining mercury and sulfur. Vermilion has significance in Taoist culture, and is regarded as the color of life and eternity.

&quot;Chinese red&quot; appears in English in 1924.

<text>The Dead Rabbits were an Irish American criminal street gang active in Lower Manhattan in the 1830s to 1850s. The Dead Rabbits were so named after a dead rabbit was thrown into the center of the room during a gang meeting, prompting some members to treat this as an omen, withdraw, and form an independent gang. Their battle symbol was a dead rabbit on a pike. They often clashed with Nativist political groups who viewed Irish Catholics as a threatening and criminal subculture. The Dead Rabbits were given the nicknames of &quot;Mulberry Boys&quot; and the &quot;Mulberry Street Boys&quot; by the New York City Police Department because they were known to have operated along Mulberry Street in the Five Points.

Tyler Anbinder, an American historian, claims that the Dead Rabbits did not exist as a gang and were actually misidentified members of the Roach Guards.
==History==

The original Dead Rabbits were founded by disgruntled gang members of the Roach Guards, who became the largest Irish crime organization in early 19th-century Manhattan, having well over 100 members when called up for action. Their chief rival gang was the Bowery Boys, native-born New Yorkers who supported the Know Nothing anti-immigrant political party, and through Michael Walsh had links to the dominant Protestant minority in Ireland and immigrants of that background; Herbert Asbury&#x27;s seemingly contradictory observation in his 1927 book &quot;Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld&quot; that the Bowery Boys were an Irish gang, despite being anti-Catholic is explained by the deep-seated divisions in religion, culture and economic circumstances between the two groups on the island of Ireland which were carried over to the new world.

These two rival gangs fought more than 200 gang battles in a span of 10 years, beginning in 1834, and they often outmanned the police force and even the state militias. Besides street-fighting, the Dead Rabbits supported politicians such as Fernando Wood and the Tammany Hall machine, whose platforms included the welfare and benefit of immigrant groups and minorities, and under the leadership of Isaiah Rynders the gang acted as enforcers to violently persuade voters during elections to vote for their candidates. According to legend, one of the most feared Dead Rabbits was &quot;Hell-Cat Maggie&quot;, a woman who reportedly filed her teeth to points and wore brass fingernails into battle.

On July 4, 1857, a prolonged riot occurred between the Dead Rabbits and the Metropolitan Police, and the Bowery gangs against the Municipal Police, Mulberry Street Boys, Roach Guards, and Dead Rabbits in Bayard Street. Their members may also have participated in the 1863 New York Draft Riots in the American Civil War, and in the Orange Riots of 1870 and 1871, which all broke out around the time of (July) The Twelfth, the date of the main annual Irish Protestant commemoration which heightened tensions between the two Irish communities in the United States (and continues to do so in Northern Ireland today).

By 1866, mentions of the Dead Rabbits as an organization currently in existence disappeared from New York City newspapers, and they were sometimes referred to in the past tense. The term &quot;Dead Rabbit&quot; was used as the 1870s as a generic term for a riotous people or groups.

=== Historical accuracy of name ===
American historian Tyler Anbinder claims that there is no evidence of a Dead Rabbits gang existing at all, and that the alleged organization was in fact a misnomer for the Roach Guards. In Anbinder&#x27;s telling of events, in the aftermath of a gang war between the Bowery Boys and the Roach Guards, reporters relied heavily on the Bowery Boys for information. The Bowery Boys likely tarred the Roche Guards with the slang term &quot;dead Rabbit party&quot;, referring to thieves, and the press continued using the term despite Five Points locals expressing incredulity at the unfamiliar name. Anbinder writes that &quot;there seems to be no justification for referring to the Bowery Boys&#x27; adversaries by [the name Dead Rabbits].&quot;

==Song==
Lyrics detailing the Dead Rabbits&#x27; battle with the Bowery Boys on July 4, 1857, were written by Henry Sherman Backus and Daniel Decatur Emmett:

&quot;Chorus&quot; 
&quot;Then pull off the coat and roll up the sleeve,&quot;
&quot;For Bayard is a hard street to travel;&quot;
&quot;So pull off the coat and roll up the sleeve,&quot;
&quot;The Bloody Sixth is a hard ward to travel I believe.&quot;

&quot;Like wild dogs they did fight, this Fourth of July night,&quot;
&quot;Of course they laid their plans accordin&#x27;;&quot;
&quot;Some were wounded and some killed, and lots of blood spill&#x27;d,&quot;
&quot;In the fight on the other side of Jordan.&quot;

&quot;Chorus&quot; 
&quot;The new Police did join the Bowery boys in line,&quot;
&quot;With orders strict and right accordin;&quot;
&quot;Bullets, clubs and bricks did fly, and many groan and die,&quot;
&quot;Hard road to travel over Jordan.&quot;

&quot;Chorus&quot; 
&quot;When the new police did interfere, this made the Rabbits sneer,&quot;
&quot;And very much enraged them accordin&#x27;;&quot;
&quot;With bricks they did go in, determined for to win,&quot;
&quot;And drive them on the other side of Jordan.&quot;

&quot;Chorus&quot; 
&quot;Upon the following day they had another fray,&quot;
&quot;The Black Birds and Dead Rabbits accordin;&quot;
&quot;The soldiers were call&#x27;d out, to quell the mighty riot,&quot;
&quot;And drove them on the other side of Jordan.&quot;
==In popular culture==
===In films and television===
The Dead Rabbits riot was featured in the &quot;History Channel&quot; documentary television series &quot;History&#x27;s Mysteries&quot; in 1998.
The story of the New York Dead Rabbits is told, in highly fictionalized form, in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, which was partially inspired by Herbert Asbury&#x27;s book &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;. In the 2014 film, &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the Dead Rabbits and the Short Tails are featured prominently; a similar theme pervades Mark Helprin 1983 novel of the same name.
The fourth season of the 2014 television series, &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; has a few Dead Rabbit characters.

===In literature===
A book of poetry by Richard Griffin, &quot;The Dead Rabbit Riot, A.D. 1857: And Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1915.
Patricia Beatty&#x27;s 1987 historical children&#x27;s fiction novel &quot;Charlie Skedaddle&quot; mentions Dead Rabbits (the main character is a Bowery Boy).

Some of the exploits of the Dead Rabbits are dramatized in Chapter XVIII of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955).

===In art===
Artist George Henry Hall&#x27;s 1858 painting is titled &quot;A Dead Rabbit&quot; (also entitled &quot;Study of the Nude&quot; or &quot;Study of an Irishman&quot;), which depicts a dead Dead Rabbit gang member killed during the riot on July 4, 1857, in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side.

===In video games===
The Dead Rabbit gang is referenced and plays a role in the game &quot;Limbus Company&quot;

Each lawmaker represents single member districts across the state. The powers of the legislature are granted under Article III of the Constitution of Hawaii. The legislature convenes at the Hawaii State Capitol building in the state capital of Honolulu, on the island of Oahu.

==History==

The legislature is a descendant of the two houses of the parliament for the Kingdom of Hawaii, the Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom, created in the 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom and continued in the subsequent 1852 Constitution as the Legislature of the Hawaiian Islands, consisting of the House of Representatives (Hawaiian Kingdom) and the House of Nobles. Following the overthrow and fall of the Kingdom of Hawai‘i in 1894 this Legislature became the legislative body of the briefly established Republic of Hawaii, and shortly afterwards under the newly organized Territory of Hawaii following the annexation by the United States in 1898. The current Hawaii State Legislature was created following the passage of the Hawaii Admission Act by the United States Congress in 1959 when the Territory of Hawaii was admitted to the Union as the 50th State.

==Members and terms==
The 51 members of the House are elected to two-year terms without term limits. The 25 members of the Senate are elected to four-year terms, also without term limits. Like many other state legislatures in the United States, the Hawaii State Legislature is a part-time body and legislators often have active careers outside of government.
According to Article III, section 4 of the Hawaii State Constitution, a legislator&#x27;s term begins on the day of the general election and ends the day of the general election if a new member is elected.

===Officers===
Members of both houses vote to select presiding officers from within their ranks, such as the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. These positions are customarily held by members of the majority party in each chamber. The Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, who also serves as Hawaii&#x27;s equivalent of a Secretary of State, is entirely removed from the legislative process.

==Sessions==

Each session of the state legislature lasts for two years, starting in each odd year. Article III, Section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution states that the legislature must convene annually in regular session at 10 a.m. on the third Wednesday in January. Regular sessions are limited to a period of 60 working days, which exclude Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and designated recess days.

The practical effect of having a two-year session is that any bill introduced in the first (odd-numbered) year which does not pass may be considered in the second year at the point in the process where its progress stopped. At the end of the biennium, however, all bills that did not pass the legislature die; to be considered again they must be reintroduced in the new session.

==Qualifications for office==
Article III, Section 7 of the Hawaii Constitution state that members of the Hawaii Senate must have been a resident of Hawaii for more than three years, have attained the age of majority and must, prior to filing nomination papers and thereafter continue to be, a qualified voter of the senate district from which the person seeks to be elected. An exception to this rule is that in the year of the first general election following district changes, but prior to the primary election, an incumbent senator may move to a new district without being disqualified from completing the remainder of the incumbent senator&#x27;s term. Members of the Hawaii House of Representatives must also have been residents of Hawaii for more than three years, must have attained the age of majority, and live in their respective house districts.

==Veto powers==
In order to override vetoes by the Governor of Hawaii, both houses of the legislature must vote by a two-thirds majority to overrule the governor. Bills presented to the governor more than ten days before the end of that year&#x27;s session must be signed into law or vetoed within ten days. Bills presented within the final ten days of the session have 45 calendar days to be signed or vetoed, provided the governor gives notice of what bills may be vetoed by the 35th day. The Legislature has the option of calling a special session on the forty-fifth day to vote to override any of the vetoed bills. All bills that are not vetoed or signed become law automatically without the governor&#x27;s signature. (This system stands in contrast to the pocket veto power held by the president at the federal level.)

The governor also has extensive line-item veto power: bills that appropriate money can have their appropriations reduced or removed entirely by the governor before signing the bill (except where they appropriate money for the judicial or legislative branches). The state legislature does not have the power to override such a veto.

==Capitol==
The Hawaii State Legislature was moved to the Hawaii State Capitol in the Capital District near downtown Honolulu on March 15, 1969. Following the 1991 session, the Capitol building was closed for four years for asbestos removal, and the Legislature moved temporarily to State Office Tower and Hemmeter Building, also known as No. 1 Capitol District Building. During this time, the Capitol was renovated to meet growing technological needs and improved accessibility for disabled people. The legislature moved back to the Capitol for the 1996 session. Prior to Governor John A. Burns&#x27;s decision to build the new Capitol building, the Hawaii State Legislature met at Iolani Palace.

<doc id="426631" wikidata="Q380525" url="?curid=426631" title="Marin Držić">
<text>Marin Držić (; also &quot;Marino Darza&quot; or &quot;Marino Darsa&quot;; 1508 – 2 May 1567) was a Croatian writer from Republic of Ragusa. He is considered to be one of the finest Renaissance playwrights and prose writers of Croatian literature.

== Life ==
Držić was born into a large and affluent family. He had six sisters and five brothers.

He was trained and ordained as a priest in Dubrovnik. Marin&#x27;s uncle was another famous author Džore Držić. After being ordained in 1526, Držić was sent in 1538 to Siena in Tuscany to study the Church Canon Law, where his academic results were average. Thanks to his extroverted and warm personality, he is said to have captured the hearts of his fellow students and professors, and was elected to the position of rector of the university. Losing interest in his studies, Marin returned to the Dubrovnik Republic in 1543.

There, he became an acquaintance of Austrian adventurer Christoph Rogendorf, who was at odds with the court of Vienna. After a brief sojourn in Vienna, Držić came back to his native city. He pursuited various exploits, including forming relationships with a group of Dubrovnik outlaws, journeying to Constantinople and visiting Venice. After a career as an interpreter, scrivener and church musician, he even became a conspirator. Convinced that Dubrovnik was governed by a small circle of elitist aristocracy bent to tyranny, he tried to persuade in five letters (four of which survive) the powerful Medici family in Florence to help him overthrow the government in his home town; they did not respond. 

He died suddenly in Venice on 2 May 1567. He was buried in the Church of St. John and Paul.

== Works ==
Držić&#x27;s works cover many fields: lyric poetry, pastorals, political letters and pamphlets, and comedies. While his pastorals (&quot;Tirena&quot;, &quot;Venera i Adon&quot; and &quot;Plakir&quot;) are still highly regarded as masterful examples of the genre, the pastoral has, as artistic form, virtually vanished from the scene.

His comedies are among the best in European Renaissance literature. As with other great comedy writers like Lope de Vega, Ben Jonson or Molière, Držić&#x27;s comedies are full of exuberant life and vitality, celebrating love, liberty and sincerity and mocking avarice, egoism and petty tyrants; both in the family and in the state. His best-known comedies include:
* &quot;Pomet&quot; (1548 or 1553) - some historiographers argue that &quot;Pomet&quot; is indeed Marin&#x27;s oldest play, his debut, while others disagree. The fact that it is lost makes it harder to classify it.
* &quot;Novela od Stanca&quot; (1550)
* &quot;Dundo Maroje&quot; (1551 or 1556) - arguably Marin&#x27;s most famous play. It was also played in some international theatres.
* &quot;Skup&quot; (1554) - thematically similar to Plautus&#x27; &quot;Aulularia&quot; and Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Miser&quot;

==Legacy==

Since its independence Croatia has awarded the Marin Držić Award for dramatic work. The Croatian Parliament also declared 2008 the &quot;Year of Marin Držić&quot;, as it is the 500th anniversary of his birth. An avenue in Zagreb is named after him. In Draškovićeva street (centre of Zagreb) there is a scenical stage named after Marin&#x27;s nickname Vidra. Nicknames are given for various reasons. In Croatian the word &quot;vidra&quot; can also refer to a person who is perfidious and resourceful.

<doc id="426635" wikidata="Q808640" url="?curid=426635" title="Baron Lyttelton">
<text>Baron Lyttelton is a title that has been created once in Peerage of England and twice in Peerage of Great Britain, both times for members of the Lyttelton family. Since 1889 the title has been a subsidiary title of the viscountcy of Cobham.

==Barons Lyttelton (1641)==

Baron Lyttelton, of Mounslow in the County of Shropshire, was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 18 February 1641 for Edward Littleton, Chief Justice of North Wales. On his death the barony became extinct.

*Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Lyttelton (1589 – 1645)

==History==

The Lyttelton barons of Frankley belong to the &quot;Frankley and Hagley branch&quot; of the extended Littleton/Lyttelton family.

In 1618, Thomas Lyttelton (1593–1650), owner of estates in Frankley, Halesowen, Hagley and Upper Arley, was created Baronet of Frankley, in the County of Worcester, in the Baronetage of England. He later represented Worcestershire in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Lichfield. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Baronet, He represented Bewdley in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baronet. He was Member of Parliament for Worcester and Camelford. Lyttelton married Christian, daughter of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet, and sister of Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, and Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple. The viscountcy of Cobham and its junior title the barony of Cobham were created with remainder, failing male issue, to (1) Lord Cobham&#x27;s eldest sister Hester Grenville (who succeeded as second Viscountess in 1749 and was created Earl Temple in 1750) and the heirs male of her body and (2) to his third sister Christian, with remainder to the heirs male of her body.

Lyttelton was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Baronet, who was a prominent politician. In 1755 he was created Baron Lyttelton, of Frankley in the County of Worcester, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He briefly represented Bewdley in the House of Commons. Lord Lyttelton had no legitimate issue and on his death in 1779 the barony became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his uncle, the seventh Baronet. He also represented Bewdley in Parliament and served as Governor of South Carolina and of Jamaica. In 1776, three years before he succeeded in the baronetcy, he was created Baron Westcote, of Balamere in the County of Longford, in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1794 he was further created Baron Lyttelton, of Frankley in the County of Worcester, in the Peerage of Great Britain. His eldest son, the second Baron, also sat as Member of Parliament for Bewdley. He was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Baron. He represented Worcestershire in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. His son, the fourth Baron, was briefly Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1846 under Sir Robert Peel and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the fifth Baron. In 1889 he succeeded his distant relative Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, as eighth Baron and Viscount Cobham, according to the aforementioned special remainder in the letters patent.

Since 1889 the holders of the Lyttelton titles of 1618 and 1794 have chosen to use the style of Viscount Cobham (see there for further history).

<text>Viscount Cobham is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was created in 1718. Owing to its special remainder, the title has passed through several families. Since 1889, it has been held by members of the Lyttelton family.

The barony and viscountcy of Cobham were subsidiary titles of the Earldom of Temple from 1749 to 1784, then subsidiary titles of the Marquessate of Buckingham from 1784 to 1822 and of the Dukedom of Buckingham and Chandos from 1822 to 1889. Since the latter year, the Cobham titles have been merged with the titles of Baron Lyttelton and Baron Westcote.

==History==

===Creation of the title===

The viscountcy of Cobham was created in 1718 for Field Marshal Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baron Cobham, 4th Baronet, of Stowe. He was the eldest son of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet.

During his lifetime, the Field Marshal received three titles in the Peerage of Great Britain:
* In 1714, he was made Baron Cobham, of Cobham in the County of Kent, with remainder to heirs male of his body. 
* In 1718, he was made Baron Cobham, of Cobham in the County of Kent, and Viscount Cobham, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to (1) his sister Hester and the heirs male of her body and failing which to (2) his third sister Christian, wife of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet, of Frankley (see Baron Lyttelton), and the heirs male of her body.

Field Marshal Lord Cobham died childless in 1749, at which time the Cobham barony of 1714 became extinct. His other titles passed to different heirs: the Temple baronetcy of 1611 passed to his cousin, Sir William Temple, 5th Baronet; the barony and viscountcy of 1718 passed, according to the special remainder, to Lord Cobham&#x27;s sister Hester, the widow of Richard Grenville, and her children.

===Lord Cobham&#x27;s heirs===
====Temple family====

The Temple family descended from Peter Temple of Burton Dassett. It was once thought that his younger son Anthony Temple founded the Irish branch of the family from whom the Viscounts Palmerston descended. Now it is argued that Sir William Temple founder of the Irish branch descended not from the Temples of Burton Dassett but from Robert Temple of Coughton (Peter Temple of Burton Dassett’s older brother) and his descendants the Temples of Temple Hall, Leicestershire. [see Rosemary O’Day, &quot;An Elite family in early modern England: The Temples of Stowe and Burton Dassett, Woodbridge, 2018, pp. 49, 54; Elizabeth Boran, ‘William Temple’, ODNB (Oxford, 2004)] Peter&quot; Temple&#x27;s elder son, John Temple, acquired the Stowe estate in Buckinghamshire. The latter&#x27;s son Thomas Temple represented Andover in Parliament. On 13 December 1613 he was created a Baronet, of Stowe in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of England. His son, Sir Peter Temple of Stowe (d. 1653) the second Baronet, represented Buckingham in both the Short Parliament and the Long Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Richard Temple, the third Baronet. He sat in Parliament for Warwickshire and Buckingham. His son succeeded as fourth Baronet in 1697 and received the Cobham titles in 1714 and 1718, respectively. At his death in 1749, the Temple baronetcy of 1611 passed to his second cousin William Temple, the fifth Baronet. It became dormant in 1786 on the death of the seventh Baronet.

====Grenville family====
The Field Marshal&#x27;s barony and viscountcy of 1718 passed, according to the special remainder, to his sister Hester, the widow of Richard Grenville, and her children. In 1749, she was further created Countess Temple in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the heirs male of her body. Lady Temple&#x27;s younger son was Prime Minister George Grenville. At her death, she was succeeded by her eldest son, the second Earl. He inherited the Temple estates, including Stowe House, and assumed the additional surname of &quot;Temple&quot;. He was also involved in politics and held office as First Lord of the Admiralty and as Lord Privy Seal. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl, the son of George Grenville. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1782 and 1783 and 1787 and 1789. In 1784 he was created Marquess of Buckingham in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Buckingham married Lady Mary Nugent, daughter of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent. Mary was in 1800 created Baroness Nugent in her own right in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to her second son George (see the Baron Nugent). In 1788 Lord Buckingham also succeeded his father-in-law as second Earl Nugent according to a special remainder in the letters patent. He assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of &quot;Nugent&quot; at the same time.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He served as Joint Paymaster of the Forces from 1806 to 1807. He married Lady Anne Eliza Brydges, the only child of James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos (a title which became extinct on his death in 1789), and assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of &quot;Brydges-Chandos&quot; in 1799. In 1822 Lord Buckingham was created Earl Temple of Stowe, in the County of Buckingham, Marquess of Chandos and Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The earldom was created with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to (1) the heirs male of the body of his deceased great-grandmother Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple, and (2) in default thereof to his granddaughter Lady Anne Eliza Mary Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, daughter of his son Richard, Earl Temple, who succeeded as second Duke. He was a Tory politician and served as Lord Privy Seal from 1841 to 1842.

On his death, the titles passed to his son, the third Duke. He was also a prominent politician and served as Lord President of the Council and as Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1868 the Duke established his right to the Scottish lordship of Kinloss before the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. However, on his death in 1889 without male issue, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles (the marquessate of Buckingham, marquessate of Chandos, earldom of Temple and earldom of Nugent) became extinct. The lordship of Kinloss passed to his daughter Mary. The earldom of Temple of Stowe passed to his sister&#x27;s son William Temple-Gore-Langton because the title had been created with a special remainder to her heirs male (see these titles for more information).

Another member of the Grenville family was Prime Minister William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He was the younger son of George Grenville and the younger brother of the first Marquess of Buckingham.

====Lyttelton family====

As the barony and viscountcy of Cobham could only descend to patrilineal descendants of Hester Temple or Christian Lyttelton, the wife of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet, they were inherited in 1889 according to the special remainders by the 3rd Duke&#x27;s distant relative Charles Lyttelton, 5th Baron Lyttelton. He was the great-great-grandson of the aforementioned Lady Christian and Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet. Before succeeding to his father&#x27;s peerages, he had represented East Worcestershire in Parliament as a Liberal. After the 4th Baron Lyttelton&#x27;s death in 1876 he had already inherited the Lyttelton Baronetcy of Frankley (1611), the Westcote barony in the Peerage of Ireland (1776) and the Lyttelton barony in the Peerage of Great Britain (1794).

The Lyttelton family seat is Hagley Hall, near Stourbridge, Worcestershire. Most owners of Hagley Hall are buried at the parish church of St John the Baptist in the adjacent Hagley Park.

Since 1889 the holders of the Lyttelton and Cobham titles have chosen to use the style of Viscount Cobham. The eighth Viscount&#x27;s son, the ninth Viscount, was Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire from 1923 to 1949. He was succeeded by his son, the tenth Viscount. He notably served as Governor-General of New Zealand from 1957 to 1962. the titles are held by his younger son, the 12th Viscount, who succeeded his elder brother in 2006.

<text>Breyten Breytenbach (; 16 September 193924 November 2024) was a South African writer, poet, and painter. He became internationally well-known as a dissident poet and vocal critic of South Africa under apartheid, and as a political prisoner of the National Party–led South African Government. He was also known as a founding member of the Sestigers, a dissident literary movement, and was one of the most important poets in Afrikaans literature.

== Early life and education ==
Breyten Breytenbach was born on 16 September 1939 in Bonnievale, South Africa. 

For secondary education, he attended Hoërskool Hugenote, in Wellington, Western Cape. He later attended the University of Cape Town, studying fine arts at the Michaelis School of Fine Art as well as philology.

==Activism and imprisonment==
Breytenbach was a political dissenter against the ruling National Party and its white supremacist policy of apartheid in the early 1960s. He was a founding member of the Sestigers, a dissident literary movement of Afrikaner writers, in 1961, and participated in protests against the exclusion of black youth from educational pathways. 

He left South Africa and lived in Europe and London for some time. In Paris, France, he married a French woman of Vietnamese ancestry, Yolande, as a result of which he was not allowed to return. The then applicable Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 and Immorality Act (1950) made it a criminal offence for a person to have any sexual relations with a person of a different race. However, in 1973, a special visa was granted to the couple to allow them to travel to South Africa for a writers&#x27; congress at the University of Cape Town.

Breytenbach was involved in the anti-apartheid movement throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, and joined the international organisation Okhela (meaning &quot;spark&quot;). He spoke out against the policy of apartheid at writers&#x27; forums and United Nations conferences.

After travelling to South Africa in 1975 on a false passport with the intention of helping black Africans organise trade unions, and to recruit members of Okhela, he was arrested. At his trial at the Supreme Court in Pretoria after being charged under the Terrorism Act 1967, he pleaded guilty to entering South Africa to start a branch of Okhela, which was intended to be a branch of the African National Congress (ANC) for white people. He was sentenced to nine years&#x27; imprisonment for high treason, the first two in solitary confinement. According to André Brink, Breytenbach was retried in June 1977 on new and fanciful charges that, among other things, he had planned a submarine attack by the Soviet Navy on the Robben Island prison through the Okhela. In the end, the judge found him guilty only of having smuggled letters and poems out of jail, for which he was fined $50. He was not physically assaulted, but the prison officials abused him verbally, taunted him by pointing out the censorship of letters from his mother, and allowed him no privacy to mourn her death. While in prison, he wrote &quot;Mouroir: Mirror Notes of a Novel&quot; (published after his release, in 1983). He revisited his prison experiences in &quot;The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist&quot; (1984), in which neither the narrator nor his confessor are given stable identities.

He served seven years and was released in December 1982 as a result of international protests and the intervention of the French president François Mitterrand. Breytenbach returned to Paris, where he remained for the rest of his life, after obtaining French citizenship.

In December 1993, he visited the &quot;new South Africa&quot;, and continued to travel there regularly, as well as spending time in the United States and Europe. He continued to be &quot;a critical observer and commentator on South African political and social issues&quot;. He became a vocal critic of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s government, and said that the ANC had turned into a &quot;corrupt organisation&quot;.

After free elections toppled the ruling National Party and ended apartheid in 1994, Breytenbach became a visiting professor at the University of Cape Town in the Graduate School of Humanities in January 2000.

He was a founding member and served as executive director of the Gorée Institute in Dakar, Senegal. This arose from an historic meeting in 1987 that became known as the Dakar Conference, between exiled leaders of the ANC and a group of liberal South Africans, mostly Afrikaners, from all walks of life. This gathering, held to define a strategy for effective struggle against the apartheid regime, was one of many that opened the way for a negotiated end to apartheid in South Africa. A good friend of Breytenbach, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, also attended. Breytenbach later taught classes at the institute.

He also campaigned against other injustices in the world. He wrote an open letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; to Ariel Sharon, Prime Minister of Israel, in 2002, saying that Israel was committing crimes against the Palestinians, and &quot;A viable state cannot be built on the expulsion of another people who have as much claim to that territory as you have&quot;.

==Writing==
Breytenbach wrote poetry, novels, plays, and essays, mostly in Afrikaans. Many of his works have been translated into multiple languages.

His first published work was &quot;Die Ysterkoei Moet Sweet&quot; (&quot;The Iron Cow Must Sweat&quot;) in 1964. It was regarded as groundbreaking in Afrikaans poetry, presenting &quot;powerful and startling ideas ... without the use of traditional rhythmic metres and attractive images&quot;. 

While in Paris, Breytenbach wrote several works about his experience as an immigrant. His work was at the time controversial in South Africa. His book &quot;Skryt. Om &#x27;n sinkende skip blou te verf&quot; (&quot;Scrit. Painting Blue a Sinking Ship&quot;), published in the Netherlands in 1972, was dedicated &quot;to the people of South Africa, denied citizenship in their own country&quot;. The book was banned from sale in South Africa.

During his imprisonment, Breytenbach wrote five volumes of poetry and English prose. His prison writings included the poem &quot;Ballade van ontroue bemindes&quot; (&quot;Ballade of Unfaithful Lovers&quot;). Inspired by François Villon&#x27;s 15th-century &quot;Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis&quot;, Breytenbach compared Afrikaner dissidents Peter Blum, Ingrid Jonker, and himself to unfaithful lovers, who had betrayed Afrikaans poetry by taking leave of it.

In 1984, he published &quot;The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist&quot;.

==Art==

Breytenbach was also known for his paintings, which have been exhibited internationally in Amsterdam, Paris, New York City, Stockholm, and Hong Kong. The works are often surreal in nature, featuring animal and human figures in captivity. He was inspired by Francisco Goya and Hieronymus Bosch.

In October to November 2018, a solo exhibition of his recent work, along with some older works, entitled &quot;The 81 ways of letting go a late self&quot;, was held at the Stevenson Gallery in Cape Town.

==Academia==
In January 2000, Breytenbach started a three-year stint as visiting professor in the departments of English and Drama in the Graduate School of Humanities at the University of Cape Town.

He also taught at the University of Natal, Princeton University, and in the Graduate Creative Writing Program at New York University. He was Global Distinguished Professor at NYU for over ten years.

==Other roles==
In 2013, Breytenbach became the curator of the Poetry Festival in Stellenbosch, near Cape Town.

==Personal life, death, and legacy==

In 1962, Breytenbach met and married the daughter of the South Vietnamese ambassador to France, Yolande Ngo Thi Hoang Lien. She was born in Vietnam and raised in France, and carried French citizenship. He had a daughter, Daphnée, and two grandsons. He also held French citizenship. He practised Zen Buddhism.

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in May 1983, Breytenbach said: &quot;I&#x27;d never reject Afrikaans as a language, but I reject it as part of the Afrikaner political identity. I no longer consider myself an Afrikaner&quot;.

Breytenbach died after a fall in Paris, France, on 24 November 2024, at the age of 85. His wife Yolande was by his side.

He was the younger brother of Jan Breytenbach (1932 – 16 June 2024), an SADF commander with political views strongly opposed to his, and Cloete Breytenbach (1933–2019), a widely published war correspondent. Cloete was notably one of the few people given permission by South African Prime Minister John Vorster to take photographs of Nelson Mandela at Robben Island following his imprisonment there in July 1964.

Breytenbach was informally considered by Afrikaans-speakers as their poet laureate and was one of the most important living poets in Afrikaans literature.

One of the jurors for the 2017 Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award, German writer, publisher, and translator Michael Krüger, wrote: &quot;Breytenbach is without question the most gifted and most productive poet of White-Africa&#x27;s literature ... His works as a poet and as a painter are now acknowledged as outstanding in understanding our modern world&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; was a Royal Navy light fleet aircraft carrier. She served in the Korean War and later, after reconstruction, as a support ship.

==Construction and design==
The &quot;Colossus&quot; class was a class of relatively small aircraft carriers which were designed to be built quickly to meet the Royal Navy&#x27;s requirements for more carriers to allow it to fight a global war. In order to allow speedy build, they were designed to mercantile rather than navy hull standards, while armour protection and long-range anti aircraft guns were not fitted. Sixteen ships were ordered by the end of 1942, but the last six were completed to a modified design as the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class.

&quot;Triumph&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was at deep load. Displacement was standard and deep load. Four Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam to two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines which in turn drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The ships had a range of at a speed of .

The flight deck was long and wide, while the hangar was long (with a extension aft of the rear lift), wide with a clear overhead height of . Two aircraft lifts (each and with a capacity of carried aircraft between the hangar and flight deck. A single BH3 catapult, capable of propelling a to a speed of , was fitted. 42 aircraft could be carried. &quot;Triumph&quot; was fitted with a close-in anti-aircraft armament of six quadruple 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom autocannon and nineteen single Bofors 40 mm guns. Four 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were also fitted.

&quot;Triumph&quot; was laid down during World War II on 27 January 1943 at Hawthorn Leslie and Company on the Tyne as Yard number 662. The relatively simple design meant that construction was relatively rapid, and &quot;Triumph&quot; was launched by Lady Mountbatten on 2 October 1944. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 9 May 1946.

==Service==
On 26 July 1946, &quot;Triumph&quot;, accompanied by the destroyer , visited the Soviet port of Kronstadt, near Leningrad, taking part in the Navy Day celebrations. In February 1947 she was assigned to the 2nd Aircraft Carrier Squadron, Mediterranean Fleet until August 1948.

===Korean War service===
In 1950, &quot;Triumph&quot; was on a cruise to Japan as part of the Far East Fleet. She was nearing Hong Kong when news reached &quot;Triumph&quot; and her accompanying ships of war breaking out in the Korean peninsula, forcing &quot;Triumph&quot; into a state of alert, including fully armed aircraft on deck. &quot;Triumph&quot;, escorted by the destroyer , who would also act as an escort to &quot;Triumph&quot;″s sister ship , was refuelled and re-provisioned at the Royal Australian Naval base at Kure, Japan. The destroyer and the cruiser , who would both have prominent roles during the Korean War, as well as the Australian , and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker , joined &quot;Triumph&quot; as she left the base.

The following day, she and her escorts, headed for Okinawa, refuelling at the American base there. Then they proceeded to western Korean waters, where other Royal Navy warships were converging. At this time, she was the sole British carrier in the Far East. She was thus destined to have a vital role in the early months of the Korean War. After joining the US Fleet, 827 Naval Air Squadron, part of &quot;Triumph&quot;″s air group, commenced operations with a number of Fireflies in the strike role, with 800 Naval Air Squadron providing fighter cover and secondary strike capability with their Seafires, a naval variant of the Spitfire.

The Seafires and Fireflies of &quot;Triumph&quot;, in conjunction with aircraft from the American carrier , hit airfields at Pyongyang and Haeju on 3 July, the first carrier strikes of the war, with &quot;Triumph&quot; launching twelve Fireflies and nine Seafires, all armed with rockets, against Heaju. The Seafires, though agile and fast, had an appearance that was a liability when operating with allied forces. The aircraft had a remarkable similarity to the Yak-9, a Second World War Soviet fighter aircraft, in service with the North Korean forces. Such similarities would play to an almost tragic incident further into &quot;Triumph&quot;″s deployment during the Korean War.

On 19 July 1950, Lieutenant P. Cane, flying a Sea Otter, an air-sea rescue aircraft, performed the last operational sea rescue of that type, when a F4U Corsair had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire, forcing the American pilot to ditch into very rough seas. The Sea Otter landed despite the adverse conditions and the American pilot was soon rescued. The Sea Otter returned to &quot;Triumph&quot; successfully, thanks mainly to the skill of the pilot, who was awarded the US Air Medal as a result.

On 28 July, an almost tragic event occurred, when a flight of Seafires were deployed to an area to investigate possible enemy air activity. They discovered that the activity was a flight of American B-29 bombers. One of the Seafires was hit by one of the bombers in its fuel tank forcing the pilot to bail out and land in terrible sea conditions. Rescue by Sea Otter was impossible due to the appalling conditions. The pilot was forced to wait about an hour until he was rescued by the American destroyer .

Further combat air patrol (CAP) and anti-submarine operations continued until she left Korean waters for Kure in Japan, where she spent her eight days there in refit. On 9 July, &quot;Triumph&quot; was back on the west coast of Korea, accompanied by the cruiser , the destroyer and two Canadian warships, and . Seafires launched numerous photographic reconnaissance operations around areas such as Mokpo, Kunsan, Chinnam, as well as Incheon. Over the next few days, Seafires destroyed two North Korean gunboats, attacked railway tracks, small coaster vessels and oil tanks.

On 23 August, &quot;Triumph&quot;, with just nine operational aircraft left, returned to Sasebo, Japan, where she joined two other carriers, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; and . While in harbour the North Koreans launched an unexpected air attack, hitting &quot;Comus&quot;, causing damage to her hull and killing one sailor in the process. She was escorted to Kure for repair by her sister ship &quot;Consort&quot;. This caused the carriers to be extra vigilant in the aftermath of the attack, with an increase in CAP operations.

On 29 August, another incident occurred, when a Fairey Firefly landed without an arrestor hook and was stopped by the safety barrier. A large piece of propeller blade broke off, hurtled towards the surface of the flying control position, breaking the glass of the operations room and entering the compartment with tragic consequences, striking Lieutenant Commander I. M. McLachlan, the commanding officer of 800 Naval Air Squadron, who later died from the injuries sustained in this freak incident. He was buried at sea off the coast of South Korea with full naval honours.

On 30 August, after a four-day patrol, &quot;Triumph&quot; returned to Sasebo, where she received 14 aircraft from the support carrier . On 3 September, &quot;Triumph&quot; departed Sasebo for the West Coast of Korea. When she got there, her aircraft performed the now routine CAP missions along with reconnaissance duties and bombardment spotting for the &quot;Jamaica&quot; and the destroyer .

After 6 September, &quot;Triumph&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, and , proceeded to the east coast of Korea to replace the carriers of the US 7th Fleet. Operations commenced on the 8th, with Fireflies and Seafires attacking numerous targets, causing much havoc for the North Korean forces.

On the 9th, bad weather forced operations to limit themselves to just eight sorties, with four Fireflies attacking the airfield at Koryo, causing a large amount of damage. 800 NAS&#x27;s aircraft was decreased yet again, now to just six aircraft, after four others had been written off. The following day, &quot;Triumph&quot; returned once again to Sasebo.

On 12 September, &quot;Triumph&quot; departed Sasebo, accompanied by &quot;Warramunga&quot; and the Royal Navy C-class destroyers - &quot;Charity&quot;, and . Their objective, though unknown to the crews of the ships at that time, was to cover the landings at Incheon. The group, part of CTF 91, a Commonwealth Task Force, was joined by the cruiser and RAN warship, &quot;Bataan&quot;, and was now known as the Northern Group. There was also a much smaller Southern Group which comprised the Canadian ships &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, and &quot;Sioux&quot;.

&quot;Triumph&quot;″s aircraft provided vital air cover for the attacking forces in the first few days before the landings. After the landings took place, &quot;Triumph&quot; and her accompanying escort, provided anti-submarine patrols, while her aircraft commenced interdiction and spotting operations. The latter operations proved very successful, with Fireflies spotting for the cruisers &quot;Jamaica&quot; and . Thanks to the spotting by the Fireflies, &quot;Jamaica&quot; launched a devastating bombardment on North Korean positions, destroying a hidden cache of weapons, which resulted in the top of a hill being obliterated, creating a large plume of smoke that reached 8,000 feet.

The end of the day&#x27;s operations led to a message to the commander of the Commonwealth naval forces, Admiral Andrewes, from the United Nations&#x27; overall commander, General Douglas MacArthur, &quot;My heartiest felicitations on the splendid conduct of the Fleet units under your command. They have added another glamorous page to the long and brilliant histories of the Navies of the British Commonwealth.&quot;

By the end of D-Day an astonishing 13,000 troops and all their equipment had been landed. On 17 September, North Korean aircraft bombed the American warship , as well as strafing the British cruiser &quot;Jamaica&quot;, killing one and wounding two. Shortly afterwards, both warships managed to carry out a brief bombardment of North Korean troops.

On 21 September, &quot;Triumph&quot; entered Sasebo for the last time in her deployment during the Korean War. She spent two days there in dry dock for temporary repairs, before departing for Hong Kong on 25 September, her role in the conflict being replaced by .

===Remainder of service===

After her Korean service &quot;Triumph&quot; was selected as the replacement for as a cadet training ship. She carried two terms each of 100 RN and Commonwealth cadets on three cruises each year, in the Spring to the West Indies, in the summer to Scandinavia and around the UK, and in the autumn to the Mediterranean. She carried three Sea Balliol aircraft with which to inculcate air-mindedness in the cadets.

In 1952, &quot;Triumph&quot; was used for the first trials of an angled flight deck. Her original deck markings were obliterated and replaced with new ones at an angle to the long axis of the ship. The success of these trials led to the development of the now-standard design, with additional areas of the flight deck added to the port side of the ship.

In 1954 she was diverted to ferry survivors of the troopship &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; from North Africa to Gibraltar for repatriation. In 1955 she replaced on a &#x27;goodwill&#x27; visit to Leningrad. This terminated in her captain, Varyl Begg, carrying out a sternboard down the Neva against a beam gale after her hastily laid Soviet sternbuoy had dragged. Her cadet training duties ended with the autumn cruise of 1955, when changes in the system of training RN officers rendered her redundant. Shortly before arriving home to Devonport, &quot;Triumph&quot; executed the last axial-deck landing in the RN.
&quot;Triumph&quot; was then converted, between 1956 and 1965, into a heavy repair ship, emerging from the work with the pennant number &quot;A108&quot;. &quot;Triumph&quot; was based in Singapore after her conversion, being involved in a major exercise in 1968 in the Solomon Sea (Exercise Coral Sands?), with numerous capital ships from the United Kingdom and other nations taking part, as well as dozens of destroyers and frigates. &quot;Triumph&quot; was used as a heavy repair and transport ship for troops. In 1975 she was placed in reserve at Chatham Dockyard where she was used as a backdrop for the annual Navy Days, and in 1981 she was struck and sold for scrapping in Spain that December. The Ministry of Defence did enquire into the possibility of buying her back following the Falklands Crisis in April 1982 but dismantling was already too far advanced.

<doc id="426644" wikidata="Q391094" url="?curid=426644" title="Roger Gale">
<text>Sir Roger James Gale (born 20 August 1943) is a British Conservative Party politician who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Herne Bay and Sandwich, previously North Thanet, since 1983. He had a career in journalism and broadcasting from 1964, around the same time as he joined the Conservative Party, until 1983. 

He was a prominent and vocal critic of Boris Johnson during his leadership of the Conservative Party.

He is the oldest MP elected in the 2024 general election.

==Early life and education==
Roger Gale was born on 20 August 1943 in Poole. He was educated at Southbourne Preparatory School and the Thomas Hardye&#x27;s School in Dorchester. He completed his education at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1963.

==Broadcasting career==
From August 1964 to January 1965, Gale worked as a radio DJ for Radio Caroline North. He worked as a programme director at Radio Scotland from 1965; personal assistant to the general manager of Universal Films from 1971 to 1972; freelance reporter at BBC Radio London from 1972 to 1973; producer at BBC Radio 1 and then at BBC Radio 4 from 1973 to 1976; became director of BBC Children&#x27;s Television in 1976 until 1979; then senior producer of children&#x27;s television and later of special projects at Thames TV from 1979 to 1983.

==Parliamentary career==
Gale stood as the Conservative candidate in Birmingham Northfield at the 1982 by-election, coming second with 35.6% of the vote behind the Labour candidate John Spellar.

At the 1983 general election, Gale was elected to Parliament as MP for North Thanet with 58.4% of the vote and a majority of 14,051. Gale made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 30 June 1983.

Gale was re-elected as MP for North Thanet at the 1987 general election with a decreased vote share of 58% and an increased majority of 17,480.

At the 1992 general election, Gale was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 57.2% and an increased majority of 18,210. Following the election, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the ministers of state at the Ministry of Defence Archie Hamilton and Jeremy Hanley until 1994.

Gale was again re-elected at the 1997 general election, with a decreased vote share of 44.1% and a decreased majority of 2,766. He was again re-elected at the 2001 general election, with an increased vote share of 50.3% and an increased majority of 6,650.

He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith from 2001 to 2003 with responsibility for presentation.

Gale was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 49.6% and an increased majority of 7,634.

In July 2008, Gale said that capital punishment was a solution to fatal knife stabbings.

At the 2010 general election, Gale was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 52.7% and an increased majority of 13,528.

Gale strongly opposed Conservative prime minister David Cameron&#x27;s introduction of same-sex marriage, stating in the House of Commons: &quot;Marriage is the union between a man and a woman. It is Alice in Wonderland territory, Orwellian almost, for any government of any political persuasion to seek to come along and try to rewrite the lexicon. It will not do&quot;.

At the 2015 general election, Gale was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 49% and a decreased majority of 10,948.

Gale was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 EU membership referendum.

At the snap 2017 general election, Gale was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 56.2% and a decreased majority of 10,738. Gale was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with an increased vote share of 62.4% and an increased majority of 17,189.

On 15 September 2020 he was one of two Conservative MPs (together with Andrew Percy) who voted against the UK Internal Market Bill at second reading.

In July 2021, Gale was one of five Conservative MPs found by the Commons Select Committee on Standards to have breached the code of conduct by trying to influence a judge in the trial of former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, who was eventually found guilty of three counts of sexual assault and sentenced to two years in prison. Gale was one of three of the group who was also recommended for a one-day suspension by the committee.

On 17 December 2021, following the North Shropshire by-election (when a Conservative majority of nearly 23,000 was overturned leading to a Liberal Democrat win), Gale said, &quot;One more strike and he&#x27;s (Boris Johnson) out.&quot; Gale said that the by-election &quot;has to be seen as a referendum on the prime minister&#x27;s performance&quot;. He later revealed he had submitted a letter of no-confidence in Johnson&#x27;s leadership to the 1922 Committee.

In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gale called for all Russian nationals living in the UK to be forcibly deported, conceding that some &quot;good and honest&quot; people would be forced to leave. Gale said he had changed his mind on challenging Johnson&#x27;s leadership following the invasion. He said, &quot;we should not seek to destabilise the government of the United Kingdom&quot;. Gale also expressed his &quot;fear&quot; about a leadership election.

In December 2022 Gale was appointed as temporary Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons in order to cover for the illness of a colleague, Eleanor Laing.

Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Gale&#x27;s constituency of North Thanet was abolished, and replaced with Herne Bay and Sandwich. At the 2024 general election, Gale was elected to Parliament as MP for Herne Bay and Sandwich with 35.3% of the vote and a majority of 2,499.

==Honours and awards==
Gale was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for public and political services. 

In February 2016, Gale was nominated for a &quot;Grassroots Diplomat&quot; award for his involvement in the campaign to save and reopen Manston Airport, which is in his constituency.

==Personal life==
Gale has been married three times: firstly to Wendy Bowman in 1964 (marriage dissolved in 1967), secondly to Susan Linda Sampson in 1971 (marriage dissolved in 1980), with whom he has a daughter; thirdly to Susan Gabrielle Marks, with whom he has two sons.

<doc id="426646" wikidata="Q391141" url="?curid=426646" title="Mike Gapes">
<text>Michael John Gapes (born 4 September 1952) is a British former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ilford South from 1992 to 2019.

Born in Wanstead Hospital, Gapes attended Buckhurst Hill County High School. He studied economics at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he was Secretary of the Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union, and later studied industrial relations at Middlesex Polytechnic. He then served as chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students.

Following an unsuccessful 1983 bid for Parliament, Gapes was elected as a Labour and Co-operative MP in 1992. He served as chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee from 2005 to 2010. In February 2019, Gapes left Labour in protest at Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership to form The Independent Group, later Change UK, along with six other Labour MPs. In the December 2019 election, Gapes was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Sam Tarry. He rejoined the Labour Party in March 2023.

==Early life and career==
Michael John Gapes was born on 4 September 1952, the son of Frank William Gapes, a postman, and Emily Florence Gapes, &quot;née&quot; Jackson. He was educated at Staples Road Infants&#x27; School in Loughton before attending Manford County Primary School and Buckhurst Hill County High School in Chigwell. He worked as a Voluntary Service Overseas teacher in Swaziland in a gap year before attending university in 1972. 

Gapes studied economics at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975, which was upgraded by convention to a Master of Arts degree in 1979. He served as Secretary of the Cambridge Students Union in 1973. He completed his education at Middlesex Polytechnic in Enfield where he earned a diploma in industrial relations in 1976, after which he served as chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students before serving for three years as the student organiser for the Labour Party.

== Political career ==

===Labour Party===
Gapes was a founder, member, and convenor of the Clause Four Group in 1974, and the sixth Chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students from 1976 to 1977, taking over following the defeat of the entryist Trotskyist Militant tendency. In 1977, he was appointed as the first National Student Organiser of the Labour Party.

Gapes worked at Labour Party Headquarters for 15 years from 1977 until 1992, including serving from 1988 to 1992 as International Secretary of the party. In 1981, he was a member of the anti-nuclear Labour Party Defence Study Group. He told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that working with Neil Kinnock &quot;to bring the Labour Party back from the abyss of 1983&quot; was most influential in his political thinking.

In his role as international secretary, in 1990 he (along with other MEPs associated with the Fabian Society) urged Kinnock and the Labour Party to be more pro-European, including full economic and monetary union, a common industrial policy, replacing the Common Agricultural Policy with a &quot;good food policy&quot; promoting healthier diets with fewer additives, pesticides, and diversified crops, as well as a European Security Organisation based on NATO and Warsaw Pact co-operation.

Gapes unsuccessfully contested Ilford North at the 1983 general election. He unsuccessfully stood for election to Wandsworth Borough Council in the 1986 election for West Hill ward in Putney, losing by only 50 votes.
=== Member of Parliament for Ilford South ===
He was elected to the House of Commons in the 1992 general election for Ilford South when he defeated the sitting Conservative MP Neil Thorne by just 402 votes. He made his maiden speech on 8 May 1992.

In Parliament he joined the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in 1992 and, after the 1997 general election, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office Paul Murphy; he also worked for the other Minister of State Adam Ingram until 1999 when he joined the Defence Select Committee. Following the 2001 general election, he was again appointed a PPS to the Minister of State at the Home Office Jeff Rooker for a year. He rejoined the Defence Select Committee in 2003. Following the 2005 general election he served as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee until 2010.

Gapes was an officer of many All-party Parliamentary Groups (APPG), including Chair of the All-Party Crossrail Group, Chair of the All-Party Global Security and non Proliferation Group and Chair of the All-Party United Nations Group. He was part of the Northern Ireland team which negotiated the Good Friday Agreement in Belfast in 1998.

During the 2001 and 2005 general election campaigns, he was the target of Muslim groups, including (according to the &quot;Ilford Recorder&quot;) the Association of Ilford Muslims, and Islamic Society of Britain (Ilford Branch), as well as (according to &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;) the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, who he says sought to unseat him because of his pro-Israel views. Gapes is a member of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI).

In 2007, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee reported that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; any abuse was continuing at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp since 2004, calling the facilities &quot;broadly comparable&quot; to HM Prison Belmarsh. Gapes said: &quot;I thought that we would see detainees in orange overalls kept in cages, but they are now in modern blocks. The images from 2002 were of Camp X-Ray and that is now shut&quot;, adding that an immediate shutdown of Guantanamo Bay would lead to a release of individuals back into society who were &quot;dangerous&quot;. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition said the report was a &quot;deep disappointment&quot; and did not acknowledge the moral responsibility to British residents in Guantanamo; Clive Stafford Smith, who represented prisoners at the base, said the report was &quot;full of factual errors&quot; and based on a &quot;show tour&quot; and Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International, called the report &quot;a missed opportunity&quot;.

Also in 2007, Gapes was criticised for claiming £22,110 for a second home despite his constituency being only 39 minutes away from Westminster. Gapes responded to the criticism saying &quot;It&#x27;s perfectly allowed&quot;. In 2008, as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Gapes met with the Dalai Lama and asked his opinion on human rights in Tibet. As head of the committee, he was heavily critical of the nuclear program of Iran, arguing that there was a &quot;strong possibility&quot; Iran would develop a nuclear bomb by 2015. Gapes was Chair of the committee until 2010 and continued to be a member of the committee until 2019.

=== Change UK ===
In the summer of 2018, &quot;The Independent&quot; noted that there was speculation that Gapes might resign over allegations of antisemitism in the party, which he eventually did in 2019. On 18 February 2019, Gapes and six other MPs—Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker, and Ann Coffey—quit Labour in protest at Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership to form Change UK. It cited disagreements over the handling of Brexit and mishandling of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party as key reasons for leaving. For Gapes, foreign policy differences were the major factor, accusing Corbyn in his resignation letter of taking the &quot;wrong side on so many international issues from Russia, to Syria, to Venezuela.&quot;

Gapes and his new party came under fire after he described those who criticised them as Islamophobic based on those selected to fight for the party in the European Elections 2019, including the Muslim Council of Britain and anti-racism charity Tell MAMA, as &quot;far left trot trolls&quot; and &quot;cultists.&quot; In September 2019, Gapes was ridiculed and accused of &#x27;mansplaining&#x27; after he incorrectly corrected the grammar of a tweet by Diane Abbott while making a grammar mistake of his own.

During the 2019 general election campaign, Gapes contacted the Metropolitan Police and electoral authorities after he was targeted by a Twitter troll known as &#x27;Mr Richard Miller&#x27;, who posed as Gapes&#x27; campaign manager and said he was fired for losing Mike Gapes&#x27; shoes. Gapes was also threatened with a cease and desist letter from lawyers representing Labour after his campaign leaflets featured the party&#x27;s red and yellow colours and a slogan reading: &quot;Real Labour Values, Independent Mind&quot;. On election night, he lost his seat to Labour&#x27;s Sam Tarry, ending his 27-year career in the UK Parliament.

==After parliament==
Gapes rejoined the Labour Party on 7 March 2023. Keir Starmer welcomed his return, stating that it was &quot;a tribute to the hard work already done to change our party.&quot; His re-entry came after Luciana Berger rejoined the party in February 2023.

==Political views==
Gapes has defended the legacies of the former British prime minister Tony Blair and the former American president Bill Clinton. He is a supporter of humanitarian intervention and voted for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and opposed the Chilcot Inquiry into the causes of the Iraq War. In August 2014 he called for a recall of Parliament to authorise military support for Iraq and intended to vote for Britain becoming involved with the bombing of IS in Syria on 2 December 2015, but was in hospital after suffering chest pains at the time of the vote. In 2018 Gapes supported a call by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee for an independent inquiry into &quot;the consequences of non-intervention&quot; by Britain in the Syrian civil war. Gapes later criticised Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for apologising for the Iraq War, and argued that the Middle East is better off following the British and American interventions. However, the Foreign Affairs Committee under his chairmanship argued for a re-evaluation of the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Britain and America and criticised Blair&#x27;s closeness to the American president George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks as damaging to British interests.

Gapes is staunchly pro-European, once declaring that he would prefer closer ties with the European Union, rather than Britain becoming an amusement park for American and Japanese tourists. He introduced 36 amendments to the EU Referendum Bill of 2013. The bill&#x27;s proposer, James Wharton, alleged that the amendments were an attempt to filibuster. In December 2017, Gapes delivered a speech to the House of Commons in which he warned that Brexit would put the production of Baileys Irish Cream, the milky whiskey liqueur, in jeopardy. The speech, in which he explained how Baileys is produced, was described by Patrick Maguire in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as &quot;infinitely memeable&quot; and as giving Gapes &quot;a bizarre online infamy&quot;.

During the Labour Party leadership elections in 2010, 2015 and 2016, he supported David Miliband, Liz Kendall and Owen Smith, respectively.

Gapes is a long-time critic of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and has called him &quot;the racist antisemite&quot;. He also criticised Corbyn&#x27;s supporters, including the prominent group Momentum. Gapes opposed Corbyn&#x27;s political views on issues such as foreign policy and Brexit. In December 2015, he criticised the Labour Party on Twitter for a U-turn on whether to run a budget surplus in &#x27;normal&#x27; economic conditions. This led to him being trolled by supporters of Corbyn online – many of whom told him to leave the party. He also called for the resignation of Corbyn&#x27;s director of communications, Seumas Milne, following comments Milne made doubting Russian state involvement in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.

==Personal life==
Gapes married Frances Smith in 1992 and they divorced in 2004. Their daughter Rebecca Gapes died of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome in 2012, at the age of 19. He has two adult stepdaughters. He is a keen supporter of West Ham United.

He stood down from the House of Commons at the 2017 general election before entering the House of Lords in 2018.

==Early life==
Edward Garnier was born in Germany, the youngest son of Colonel William d&#x27;Arcy Garnier and Lavender &quot;née&quot; de Grey (eldest daughter of the 8th Baron Walsingham). He was educated at Wellington College. He read Modern History at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1974. As per tradition, his BA was promoted to MA (Oxon) in 1976; he then studied for Bar Finals at the Inns of Court School of Law in London.

==Legal career==
Garnier was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1976. He is a practising barrister specialising in libel. He took silk (became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel) in 1995, and was appointed as a Crown Court Assistant Recorder in 1998 and as a Recorder (part-time Circuit Judge) in 2000.

He represented Edwina Currie following an article in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; by Peter Oborne alleging she was the &quot;vilest woman in Britain&quot;. Currie won £30,000 in damages in March 2000. In 2013, he also represented Lord McAlpine at the High Court following allegations made on Twitter by Sally Bercow, wife of the Commons speaker.

Garnier represented former Prime Minister John Major in the High Court and UK Supreme Court hearings regarding the prorogation of parliament in September 2019. Major was arguing against the prorogation, which was instigated by Major&#x27;s successor Boris Johnson.

==House of Commons==
Garnier unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour seat of Hemsworth in West Yorkshire at the 1987 general election. At the 1992 general election, he was elected MP for Harborough with a majority of 13,543 following the retirement of his Conservative predecessor Sir John Farr, and made his maiden speech just after midnight on 20 May 1992.

In the House of Commons, he served on the home affairs select committee from 1992 until he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Alastair Goodlad and David Davis for a year in 1994. In 1996 he became the PPS to the Attorney General Nicholas Lyell and in 1997 he was briefly the PPS to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Roger Freeman.

He joined the frontbench under William Hague as a spokesman on the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department in 1997 and entered the Shadow Cabinet in 1999 as the Shadow Attorney General, according to a BBC News report earning wide acclaim for a thoughtful performance in that role, in which he demonstrated his legal expertise without becomingly excessively partisan. He returned to the backbenches after the 2001 general election but became Opposition Spokesman for Home Affairs after the 2005 general election and later Shadow Attorney General.
In 2009, he was elected Chair of the newly formed All-Party Parliamentary Group on Privacy.

On 5 February 2013, Garnier voted against in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

In April 2017, Garnier announced his intention to retire and not to contest his seat in the upcoming general election, to be held on 8 June 2017, after 25 years as MP for Harborough.

===Compulsory annuity purchases===
Garnier has long campaigned against compulsory annuity purchases for sums above the minimum income threshold and has introduced or supported several Private Members Bills on the issue. On 21 November 2002, he came 4th in the ballot for Private Members Bills. With cross-party support from leading backbench pensions experts Sir John Butterfill, Frank Field and LibDem Pensions spokesman Steve Webb he introduced the Retirement Income Reform Bill. This Bill was dropped in July 2003, reintroduced on 7 January 2004 and eventually withdrawn in April 2004.

===Constituency issues===

====Pennbury eco-town====
Garnier has raised the issue of eco-towns around 20 times in Parliament. One of these, Pennbury, housing 40,000 people, was to be near Stoughton, Leicestershire. Garnier was granted an adjournment debate on 29 January 2008.

Garnier argued that although the eco-town principle was sound, Pennbury - a rural site not a brownfield one - lacked the necessary transport infrastructure and was unlikely to be able to provide jobs. Furthermore, building a suitable road from the M1 motorway, &quot;a distance of about 20 miles ..would cost the thick end of £1 billion&quot;. The Pennbury proposal was dropped in July 2009.

====British United Shoe Machinery====
Garnier&#x27;s constituents were amongst 544 British United Shoe Machinery workers who lost their pensions following the company entering Administration in 2000.
Workers joined Ros Altmann&#x27;s company pensions campaign blaming Venture Capitalist Apax Partners for having engineered the collapse and Garnier was the first East Midlands MP to question Apax&#x27;s role. Apax&#x27;s chairman at the time was a major donor to the Labour Party and Garnier asked what discussions &quot;Ministers have had with Sir Ronald Cohen ..about the collapse of the pension scheme&quot;. Garnier raised the issue again with the new Minister for Pensions Reform Stephen Timms citing the &quot;mysterious circumstances&quot; under which the pensions disappeared. Timms agreed to &quot;look into&quot; the complaints saying that &quot;in recent years, there have been too many instances of that kind.&quot;
The press expected a proper enquiry but although in September 2005 Timms wrote back to Garnier refusing this, December 2007 saw compensation of £2.9 billion awarded nationally to failed Company Pension Scheme workers. In all Garnier referenced BUSM twelve times, and &quot;was a really valuable advocate in the campaign to recover the pensions&quot;.

====St Luke&#x27;s hospital Market Harborough====
In June 2015 Garnier called on Jeremy Hunt to &quot;get a grip on those allegedly in charge of the project&quot; at St Luke&#x27;s hospital which he said had become a local joke. He claimed the project had been the subject of delays since 1992.

===Solicitor General===

Garnier was Solicitor General from May 2010 to September 2012. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor after the reshuffle that ended his time as Solicitor General.

In November 2014, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported allegations that Garnier requested that Simon Danczuk &quot;think very carefully&quot; about what he said to the Home Affairs select committee about Leon Brittan and the missing Westminster paedophile dossier. Danczuk said that Brittan was in poor health, and that Garnier, an old friend, had been asked to intervene by Brittan&#x27;s wife.

On 30 March 2015, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and was therefore granted the title The Right Honourable.

===Brexit===
Garnier was opposed to Brexit before the 2016 referendum. Following a successful legal challenge to the use of the Royal Prerogative to invoke article 50, Garnier advised against appealing to the Supreme Court. He believed the chances of winning were low, proceeding would have been costly, and it would have provided another &quot;opportunity for ill-motivated people to attack the judiciary to misconstrue the motives of both parties&quot;. The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve also thought the appeal was pointless.

==House of Lords==
On 22 June 2018, Garnier was created a life peer as Baron Garnier, of Harborough in the County of Leicestershire, thus becoming a member of the House of Lords.

==Personal life==
Garnier married Anna Caroline Mellows on 17 April 1982.

He was a Visiting Fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1996 and is a keen follower of cricket, being a member of Leicestershire CCC. He speaks proficient French and enjoys 19th-century French literature.

His cousin is Mark Garnier who has been the Member of Parliament for Wyre Forest since the 2010 general election.

<doc id="426652" wikidata="Q391275" url="?curid=426652" title="Andrew George (politician)">
<text>Andrew Henry George (born 2 December 1958) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for St Ives in Cornwall since 2024, previously representing the constituency from 1997 to 2015, when he was defeated by the Conservatives&#x27; Derek Thomas. He was the vice-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Housing and Planning Group in the 2010 parliament. George has served as a member of Cornwall Council for Ludgvan, Madron, Gulval and Heamoor, having been elected in the 2021 council election.

==Early life==
Andrew Henry George was born on 2 December 1958 in the village of Mullion near The Lizard, on the southwest coast of Cornwall, one of eight children born to horticulturist Reginald Hugh George and music teacher Diana May George ().

==Education==
George was educated locally at Helston Grammar School, in the town of Helston in Cornwall, before attending the University of Sussex where he received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in cultural and community studies in 1980. He finished his education at University College at the University of Oxford, where he was awarded a Master of Science (MSc) degree in agricultural economics in 1981.

==Life and career==
George worked as a charity worker, initially, as a rural officer with the Nottinghamshire Rural Community Council in 1981, and held a number of appointments in charity, business and research, until he became the deputy director of the Cornwall Rural Community Council in 1987, where he remained until his election to the House of Commons. Before joining the Liberal Democrats he was a member of Mebyon Kernow, and was one of the founder members of the Cornish Constitutional Convention, campaigning for a Cornish Assembly.

He contested the seat of St Ives at the 1992 general election where he finished second, just 1,645 votes behind the sitting Conservative MP David Harris. Harris stood down at the 1997 general election and George won the seat with a majority of 7,170 and remained as the MP there until 2015. He made his maiden speech on 22 May 1997.

===In Parliament===
In the House of Commons, George led the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Parliamentary DEFRA and Environment team as LibDem Spokesman for agriculture. He rebelled against the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government more than any other Liberal Democrat MP.

George was made the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Fisheries Spokesman by Paddy Ashdown in 1997, a role he undertook until 2007. Under the new leadership of Charles Kennedy in 1999 he also became Disability spokesperson as part of the Department of Social Security team. Following the 2001 General Election he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Kennedy. He became Rural Affairs and Food spokesperson in 2002, a role he held until 2005. He was International Development spokesperson from the 2005 general election until 2006.

On 6 January 2006, George was one of the first members of the Liberal Democrat frontbench team to threaten to resign his post if Charles Kennedy had not stood down as leader by 9 January 2006. He was replaced on the front bench on 8 March by Kennedy&#x27;s successor, Sir Menzies Campbell.

George suffers from the autoimmune disease Ankylosing spondylitis and has campaigned for a TNF inhibitor drug treatment to be made available to all patients. He is a member of the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society&#x27;s experts panel.

In the 2010 general election, George&#x27;s majority was substantially reduced from 11,609 to 1,719 following boundary changes to his constituency.

In 2011–2012, George was a leading figure of a LibDem rebellion against the Cameron–Clegg government&#x27;s proposed Health and Social Care Bill 2011, describing it as &quot;a missed opportunity to reform health and social care&quot; and a violation of the coalition agreement. The rebellion saw dozens of LibDems voting against the bill alongside Labour. Despite this, the bill passed 314–260.

During the so-called &quot;Bonfire of the quangos&quot; by the government, in 2013 George opposed plans to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, the governmental body which had been responsible for regulating farm workers&#x27; wages, on the grounds that it could harm the pay and conditions of farmers.

====Cornish issues====
From his election victory in 1997, George has campaigned in Parliament on many issues key to Cornwall. An early success was the campaign to win millions of pounds of European economic aid for Cornwall from the Objective One funding programme, for which he chaired the All Party Parliamentary Objective One Group.

On 12 May 2005, George became the first MP to swear his oath of allegiance to the Queen in Cornish after a long campaign for the language&#x27;s official recognition. George also claims to have been the first MP to use Cornish in his maiden speech back in 1997.

In 2007, George voted in Parliament against Cornwall becoming a unitary authority. Local polls commissioned by Penwith District Council indicated that almost 90% of the public were opposed to the formation of the Cornish unitary authority.

==== Opposition to bedroom tax ====
George sponsored a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, the Affordable Homes Bill, to limit the application of the &quot;bedroom tax&quot; benefit cut only to tenants that had rejected a &quot;reasonable offer&quot; of alternative accommodation with the correct number of bedrooms. The bill reached the second reading stage after the Government was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons, but failed to proceed further because the Government did not supply a Money Resolution. George opposed the &quot;bedroom tax&quot; in earlier votes, saying that those who supported it &quot;should come down to meet some of my constituents who are affected by it and look them in the eye as they attempt to justify it&quot;.

===On Cornwall Council===
In March 2021, it was reported that George was standing for election to Cornwall Council in the 2021 local elections. At the elections, George won the seat of Ludgvan, Madron, Gulval and Heamoor with 56% of the vote, beating a Conservative incumbent.

In February 2022 it was announced that George would once again be standing as the Liberal Democrats&#x27; candidate for the St Ives constituency at the next general election. After being elected to Parliament, George announced in August 2024 that he would stand down at the 2025 elections.

== Personal life ==
George married Jill Elizabeth Marshall in 1987. They have a son and a daughter.

<doc id="426654" wikidata="Q5572195" url="?curid=426654" title="Glovertown">
<text>Glovertown is a town in northeastern Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is in Division No. 7 on Alexander Bay.

==History==
Originally, Glovertown was called Bloody Bay. That name dated back to the 18th century and supposedly it referred to a massacre of a family of 11 by Beothuk natives that were living in the area at the time. The town was renamed Alexander Bay in 1894. During 1894, a section of railway was being built in the area. A few years later, the town was renamed to Glovertown, its current name, after Sir John Hawley Glover who served as the governor of Newfoundland from 1876 to 1881 and from 1883 to 1885.

The first settlers of Glovertown appeared in the early 19th century. In 1845, 12 people lived there. By 1857, there were only 10; by 1862 there were only eight. Then in 1869, the population jumped up to 80 and Glovertown started to become a thriving center for the fishery, boat building and lumbering industries. By 1891, there were 288 residents and the population had grown to 408 by 1911.

Separate settlements had been established by that time in the Saunders Cove to Northwest Arm area. Presently these areas are part of Glovertown.

On July 2, 1913, one of the sawmills located at Rosedale exploded and six people were killed. By 1935 there were 842 people living in the Glovertown area; 160 in Glovertown North, 325 in Glovertown Center, 53 in Angle Brook, 24 in Glovertown South and 24 in Alexander Bay. This population fluctuated in the coming years. The population continued to fluxuate for the next 11 years, until the forest fire of 1946.

In 1946, there was a fire that was started by sparks coming from a passing train. The fire destroyed 46 homes and left families homeless. Two schools, several businesses and of timber were also destroyed during the fire. The lumber industry has never recovered from this loss.

Eventually people from Greenspond, Flat Island, Bragg&#x27;s Island, and Gooseberry Island began to resettle to Glovertown and the influx of new people brought new industries to the town, including dairy and construction.

By 1971, the population of Glovertown was 1,915 and in 1981 it was 2,165. The Glovertown Regional High School was built in 1957 and an elementary school was built next to it in 1975. In 1998, both of the schools were joined to create present-day Glovertown Academy.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Glovertown had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="426659" wikidata="Q2070905" url="?curid=426659" title="Ralph Goodale">
<text>Ralph Edward Goodale (born October 5, 1949) is a Canadian diplomat and retired politician who has served as the Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom since April 19, 2021.

Goodale was first elected in 1974 as the member of Parliament (MP) for Assiniboia, as a member of the Liberal Party. He was defeated in 1979, and moved into provincial Saskatchewan politics, serving as leader of the Saskatchewan Liberals from 1981 to 1988. He returned to federal politics in 1993, as the MP for Regina—Wascana (known simply as Wascana from 1997 to 2015), and served in the governments of Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin and Justin Trudeau, in several roles including as minister of finance and minister of public safety. He was defeated in 2019 and retired from politics.

==Early life==
Goodale was born in Regina, Saskatchewan and raised on a farm near Wilcox, Saskatchewan, the son of Winnifred Claire (Myers) and Thomas Henry Goodale. He was a member of Scouts Canada and earned the rank of Queen&#x27;s Scout. He first attended the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus and then obtained a law degree from the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, where he was awarded the Gold Medal for academic achievement.

==Federal politics, 1974–1979==
Active at politics from a young age, he was first elected to the Parliament of Canada in the 1974 election at the age of 24 from the seat of Assiniboia. He defeated New Democratic Party (NDP) incumbent Bill Knight. He served as a backbench supporter of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s government until the 1979 election, when he was defeated, coming in third behind winning Progressive Conservative Lenard Gustafson and Knight.

==Provincial politics==
In 1981, Goodale was named leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party. He led that party to a very poor showing in the 1982 provincial election, in which the party received 4.51% of the popular vote and won no seats in the provincial legislature. However, Goodale was the only Liberal candidate to receive more than 1,000 votes; he won 2,760 in Assiniboia-Gravelbourg and lost narrowly to incumbent Allen Engel.

The party won 9.99% of the vote in the 1986 provincial election, but only Goodale was elected to the legislature, defeating Engel in a rematch. Goodale ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility in this election, arguing that both the Progressive Conservative and New Democratic parties favoured excessive spending policies, typified by their proposals for a Keynesian-style stimulation of the provincial economy through subsidized home improvement and renovation schemes.

==Return to federal politics==
===Defeated in 1988 election===
Goodale resigned as leader to run for the federal Liberals in the 1988 election for the seat of Regina—Wascana. He lost narrowly to former Regina mayor Larry Schneider, who later went on to serve briefly in Kim Campbell&#x27;s cabinet. Beginning earlier that year and prior to his resignation, Goodale&#x27;s executive assistant was Jason Kenney. Kenney would become a Conservative Party of Canada MP in Calgary ridings Calgary Southeast and Calgary Midnapore (1997–2016) and later Premier of Alberta (2019-2022).

Goodale then spent five years in the private sector, working for companies such as the Pioneer Life Assurance Company, Pioneer Lifeco Inc., and Sovereign Life Insurance Co.; he has stated in interviews that he felt his political career had ended.

===In government, 1993–2006===

Goodale contested Regina—Wascana again in the 1993 federal election and was elected as part of the Liberal landslide that year. As a member of the new Chrétien cabinet, Goodale was named Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. He has the prenominal &quot;the Honourable&quot; and the postnominal &quot;PC&quot; for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on November 4, 1993. He was reelected for this riding, known as Wascana from 1997 to 2015, in the next seven federal elections.

In 1997, he became the Minister of Natural Resources. In May 2002, he was named Minister of Public Works and Government Services, a few weeks after the Auditor General Sheila Fraser issued a report accusing the department of inappropriate contracting practices. This began the exposure of the Sponsorship scandal.

A close ally of Paul Martin, Goodale was appointed to the senior portfolio of Finance Minister when Martin became Prime Minister on December 12, 2003. In that capacity he tabled two consecutive balanced budgets and launched the Government&#x27;s productivity agenda.

On December 28, 2005, a letter surfaced from Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli confirming the force was launching a criminal investigation into whether details regarding government tax policies relating to income trust funds were leaked from the Finance Minister&#x27;s office. Goodale said he would co-operate completely with any investigation, but would not step aside while the RCMP continued their probe. The investigation dealt only with the Department of Finance, and not the minister himself. On February 15, 2007 the RCMP announced the conclusion of the income trust investigation and laid a charge of &#x27;Breach of Trust&#x27; against Serge Nadeau, an official in the Department of Finance, who pleaded guilty in 2010. Goodale was cleared of any wrongdoing, and blamed the NDP&#x27;s Judy Wasylycia-Leis for sabotaging the Liberals in the 2006 election.

===In opposition, 2006–2015===
Goodale was re-elected to the House of Commons in the general election on January 23, 2006, but the Conservatives won government and he lost his cabinet position. He was named Opposition House Leader by interim Liberal leader Bill Graham in 2006, and continued to serve in this role under the leaderships of Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff until September 2010 when he was promoted to Deputy Leader.

====2006 Liberal Party leadership election====
After the Liberals&#x27; defeat and Paul Martin&#x27;s election-night announcement that he would resign as party leader, Goodale initially indicated that he was not interested in succeeding Martin in that post. &quot;I do not anticipate ever having to cross that bridge,&quot; he said. &quot;I rule it out.&quot; On March 13, 2006, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Goodale was reconsidering his decision, and stated that he may enter the Liberal leadership election after all. In the end, he declined, citing his inability to speak French as a key reason. On November 28, 2006, he endorsed Bob Rae to be the next leader of the Liberal Party. After the third ballot, Bob Rae, who finished third, was eliminated. Goodale then endorsed Stéphane Dion, the eventual winner.

Goodale was opposed to David Orchard&#x27;s candidacy in the by-election for Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River. Dion terminated the nomination contest and appointed Joan Beatty as the candidate.

====Proposed coalition government, 2008====
Goodale was re-elected once more in the fall of 2008. One month later, in November 2008, the Liberals and their fellow opposition parties in the Canadian parliament, the NDP and Bloc Québécois, indicated their intention to defeat Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative government in a motion of no confidence, and expressed their desire for Governor General Michaëlle Jean to ask a member of the opposition to form a new government. While there was initially some speculation that Goodale would become Prime Minister of Canada as leader of the proposed coalition government, the coalition agreement simply made &quot;the leader of the Liberal Party&quot; Prime Minister. The Liberals agreed shortly after that Stéphane Dion would lead the government on an interim basis until a new Liberal leader was chosen. In the end, at Prime Minister Harper&#x27;s request, Jean prorogued Parliament before a confidence vote could be put to the House. By the time Parliament resumed in January 2009, Michael Ignatieff had become interim leader of the party. He did not seek to bring down the government and agreed to support Harper&#x27;s budget with amendments.

====2011 election====
Goodale was one of the 34 Liberal MPs who was returned in the 2011 federal election, the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s worst-ever electoral performance. He and Kevin Lamoureux of Winnipeg North in Winnipeg, Manitoba, were the only two Liberal MPs elected from the Prairie provinces.

The NDP surpassed the Liberals in number of seats, becoming the official opposition, resulted in priority in choosing parliamentary offices. They requested that Goodale forfeit his suite in the coveted Central Block. The Liberals saw this as a measure of disrespect to Goodale, noting that he had seniority as a former cabinet minister and house leader, despite this being standard practice and noting the Conservatives had not asked any Liberals to give up their offices.

===In government, 2015–2019===
The Liberals won a majority government in the 2015 federal election, and Goodale was re-elected to a ninth term in the House of Commons, once again representing Regina—Wascana as a consequence of redistricting. In his first cabinet, the new prime minister Justin Trudeau named Goodale to be Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. He was the only MP to serve in government with both Pierre and Justin Trudeau. An order in council on November 4, 2015, placed Goodale as first in line to assume the prime minister&#x27;s powers and duties as &quot;acting prime minister&quot;, should Prime Minister Justin Trudeau become incapacitated. Trudeau did not appoint a deputy prime minister at that time.

Goodale sought re-election in the 2019 federal election, but lost his bid to Conservative Party candidate Michael Kram in a rematch of the 2015 race. Despite having represented the riding since 1993, Goodale was defeated by more than 16 percentage points.

==Post-politics==
On March 31, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment of Goodale as Special Advisor to the Government of Canada&#x27;s response to Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crash. Goodale will &quot;examine lessons learned&quot; from Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, Air India Flight 182 and other air disasters and &quot;develop a framework to guide Canada&#x27;s responses to international air disasters.&quot;

== Diplomatic career ==

Goodale was appointed the Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom on April 13, 2021, replacing Janice Charette, who was appointed the interim clerk of the Privy Council. Goodale&#x27;s priorities in the position will include &quot;working with the U.K. on climate change and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic&quot; as well as replacing the &quot;transitional trade agreement with a permanent deal in the wake of Brexit&quot;.

On December 13, 2023, Goodale was appointed as representative of Canada to the Ismaili Imamat.

=== Reactions to appointment ===
The appointment drew praise from Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe, who called the appointment &quot;well deserved&quot; and stating Goodale will be &quot;a real advocate and a great representative for the nation and Canada, but he’ll also be, in many ways, a great representative for the province of Saskatchewan&quot;, as well as Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong, who said Goodale &quot;brings a lot of experience to the job&quot;.

<text>An educational programming language (EPL) is a programming language used primarily as a learning tool, and a starting point before transitioning to more complex programming languages.

==Types of educational programming languages==
===Assembly languages===
Initially, machine code was the sole method of programming computers. Assembly language (ASM), introduced mnemonics to replace low-level instructions, making it one of the oldest programming languages still used today. Numerous dialects and implementations exist, each tailored to a specific computer processor architecture. Assembly languages are low-level and more challenging to use, as they are untyped and rigid. For educational purposes, simplified dialects of assembly languages have been developed to make coding more accessible to beginners.
Assembly languages are designed for specific processor architectures, and they must be written with the corresponding hardware in mind. Unlike higher-level languages, educational assembly languages require a representation of a processor which can be virtual or physical. These languages are often used in educational settings to demonstrate the fundamental operations of a computer processor.
* Little Man Computer (LMC), (1965) is an instructional model of a simple von Neumann architecture computer. It includes the basic features of modern computers and can be programmed using machine code (usually in decimal) or assembly. The model simulates a computer environment using a visual metaphor of a person (the &quot;Little Man&quot;) in a room with 100 mailboxes (memory), a calculator (the accumulator) and a program counter. LMC is used to help students understand basic processor functions and memory management.
* MIX (1968) and MMIX (1999) are computer models featured in Donald Knuth&#x27;s (Art of Computer Programming&quot;).&quot; The MIX computer is designed for educational purposes, illustrating how a basic machine language operates. Despite its simplicity, it can handle complex tasks typical of high-performance computers. MIX allows programming in both binary and decimal, with software emulators available for both models. MMIX, which superseded MIX, is a 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture, modernized for teaching contemporary computer architecture.
* DLX (1994) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor architecture created by key developers of the MIPS and Berkeley RISC designs. DLX is a simplified version of MIPS, offering a 32-bit load/store architecture commonly used in college-level computer architecture courses.
* Next Byte Codes (NBC), (2007) is a simple assembly language used for programming Lego Mindstorms NXT programmable bricks. The NBC compiler produces NXT-compatible machine code and is supported on Windows, macOS and Linux.
* Little Computer 3 (LC-3), (2019) is an assembly language with a simplified instruction set, enabling the writing of moderately complex assembly programs. It includes many features found in more advanced languages, making it useful for teaching basic programming and computer architecture. It is primarily used in introductory computer science and engineering courses.

===BASIC variants===
BASIC (Beginner&#x27;s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was invented in 1964, to provide computer access to non-science students. It became popular on minicomputers during the 1960s and became a standard computing language for microcomputers during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The goals of BASIC were focused on the need to learn to program easily and they are to:
* Be easy for beginners to use.
* Be interactive.
* Provide clear and friendly error messages.
* Respond quickly.
* Not require an understanding of computer hardware or operating systems.

What made BASIC attractive for education was the small size of programs that could illustrate a concept in a dozen lines. BASIC continues to be frequently self-taught with tutorials and implementations.

BASIC offers a learning path from learning-oriented BASICs such as Microsoft Small Basic, BASIC-256 SIMPLE and to more full-featured BASICs like Visual Basic, NET and Gambas.
* Microsoft Small Basic is a restricted version of Visual Basic, which is designed as &quot;an introductory programming language for beginners&quot;. It&#x27;s intentionally minimal with just 15 keywords for basic functionality. By providing specific libraries for topics that interest children, they can create programs for both the web and desktop environments. For example, with 6 lines of code, it is possible to demonstrate a random network image viewer using Flickr as the source. The system utilizes the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE to provide auto-completion and context-sensitive help.
* Basic-256 is an easy-to-use version of BASIC designed to teach anybody the basics of computer programming. It uses traditional BASIC control structures (gosub, for loops, goto) for easy understanding of program flow control. It has a built-in graphics mode that allows children to draw pictures on the screen after minutes.
* SiMPLE is a programming development system that was created to provide easy programming abilities for everybody, especially non-professionals. It is somewhat like AppleSoft BASIC. It is compiled and lets users make their own libraries of often-used functions. &quot;Simple&quot; is a generic term for three slightly different versions of the language: Micro-SIMPLE (uses only 4 keywords), Pro-SiMPLE, and Ultra-SiMPLE (using 23 keywords).
* Hot Soup Processor is a BASIC-derived language used in Japanese schools.
* TI-BASIC is a simple BASIC-like language implemented in Texas Instruments graphing calculators, often serving as a student&#x27;s first look at programming.
* Small BASIC is a fast and easy-to-learn BASIC language interpreter ideal for everyday calculations, scripts and prototypes. It includes trigonometric, matrix and algebra functions, a built-in IDE, a powerful string library, system, sound and graphic commands, and a structured programming syntax.

===C-based===
* Ch is a C/C++ interpreter designed to help non-CS students learn math, computing and programming in C and C++. It extends C with numerical, 2D/3D graphical plotting and scripting features.

===Java-based===
* Written in Java and Scala - a development environment for building and exploring scientific models, specifically agent-based models.

===Lisp-based===
* Lisp is the second oldest family of programming languages in use today and as such has many dialects and implementations with a wide range of difficulties. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, based on lambda calculus, which makes it particularly well suited for teaching theories of computing. As one of the earliest languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, object-oriented programming and the self-hosting compiler, all of which are useful for learning computer science. The name LISP derives from &quot;List Processing language.&quot; Linked lists are one of the languages major data structures and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp. Therefore, Lisp can be useful for learning language design.

===Logo-based===
* Logo is a language that was specifically designed to introduce children to programming. The first part of learning Logo deals with &quot;turtle graphics&quot; (derived from turtle robots) used as early as 1969. In modern implementations, an abstract drawing device, called the &quot;turtle&quot;, is used to make programming for children very attractive by concentrating on doing turtle graphics. Seymour Papert, one of the creators of Logo, was a prominent figure in constructionism, a variety of constructivist learning theories. Papert argued that activities like writing would naturally be learned by much younger children provided that they adopt a computing culture. Logo was designed to introduce children to programming through visual aids and concepts in a technology-focused curriculum. &quot;M&quot;ore important than having an early start on intellectual building is being saved from a long period of dependency during which one learns to think of learning as something that has to be dished out by a more powerful other...Such children would not define themselves or allow society to define them as intellectually helpless.&quot;&quot; It has been used by children as young as 3 years old and has a track record of 30 years of success in education. Since Logo is actually a streamlined version of Lisp with more advanced students, it can be used to introduce the basic concepts of computer science and even artificial intelligence. Logo is available on multiple platforms, offered in both free and commercial versions for educational use.

===Scala-based===
* Kojo is an interactive desktop development environment, developed primarily for educational purposes. The application runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. Kojo is a learning environment, with many different features that help with the exploration, learning and teaching of concepts in computer programming, critical thinking, math, science, art, music, creative thinking, computer and internet literacy.

===Smalltalk-based===
As part of the One Laptop per Child project, a sequence of Smalltalk-based languages has been developed, each designed to act as an introduction to the next. The structure is Scratch to Etoys to Squeak to any Smalltalk. Each provides graphical environments that may be used to teach not only programming concepts to kids but also physics and mathematics simulations, story-telling exercises, etc., through the use of constructive learning. Smalltalk and Squeak have fully featured application development languages that have been around and well-respected for decades; Scratch is a children&#x27;s learning tool.
* Scratch 1.0 is implemented in Smalltalk. See below for more information.
* Etoys is based on the idea of programmable virtual entities behaving on the computer screen. Etoys provides a media-rich authoring environment with a simple, powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles, presentations, web pages, videos, sound and MIDI (the ability to share desktops with other Etoys users in real-time). Many forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet. It is multilingual and has been used successfully in the United States, Europe, South America, Japan, Korea, India, Nepal and elsewhere. The program is aimed at children between the ages of 9-12.
* Squeak is a modern, open-source, full-featured implementation of the Smalltalk language and environment. Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language created to underpin the &quot;new world&quot; of computing exemplified by &quot;human-computer symbiosis&quot;. Like Lisp, it has image-based persistence, so everything is modifiable from within the language (see Smalltalk#Reflection). It has greatly influenced the industry introducing many of the concepts in object-oriented programming and just-in-time compilation. Squeak is the vehicle for a wide range of projects including multimedia applications, educational platforms and commercial web application development. Squeak is designed to be highly portable and easy to debug, analyze and change, as its virtual machine is written fully in Smalltalk.

===Pascal===
* Pascal is an ALGOL-based programming language designed by Niklaus Wirth in approximately 1970 with the goal of teaching structured programming. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, it was the primary choice in introductory computer science classes for teaching students programming in both the US and Europe. Its use for real-world applications has since increased to general usage.

===Other===
* CircuitPython is a beginner-oriented version of Python for interactive electronics and education.
* Rapira is an ALGOL-like procedural programming language, with a simple interactive development environment, developed in the Soviet Union to teach programming in schools.
* is a tactile offline programming language embedded in an educational card game.

==Children==
* AgentSheets and AgentCubes are two computational thinking tools to author 2D/3D games and simulations. Authoring takes place through desktop applications or browser-based apps, and it can create 2D/3D games playable in HTML5 compliant browsers, including mobile ones.
* Alice is a free programming software designed to teach event-driven object-oriented programming (OOP) to children. Programmers create interactive stories using a modern IDE interface with a drag-and-drop style of programming. The target audience ranges from middle school children all the way to university students. Storytelling Alice is a variant of the Alice software designed for younger children, with a greater emphasis on its capabilities in terms of storytelling.
* Blockly is an open-source web-based graphical language where users can drag blocks together to build an application with no typing required. It was developed by Google. It allows users to convert their Blockly code into other programming languages such as PHP, Python, etc.
* CiMPLE was a visual language for programming robotic kit designed for children. It was built on top of C as a DSL. ThinkLabs, an Indian Robotics education-based startup, built it for the iPitara Robotics Kit. The language bore strong resemblance to the C language. At least one school in Bangalore, India bought the iPitara kit and had their students program the robots using CiMPLE. More information is available at the CiMPLE Original Developers Weblog. ThinkLabs eventually switched to using &quot;THiNK VPL&quot; as their visual programming software.
* Physical Etoys is a free open-source extension of Etoys. Its philosophy is that &quot;it helps children explore their own creativity by combining science and art in an infinite laboratory.&quot; It can run on Windows, Linux and Sugar. Due to its block scripting system, Physical Etoys allows different electronic devices such as Lego NXT, Arduino boards, Sphero, Kinect, and Wiimote joysticks interact between themselves.
* Hackety Hack is a free Ruby-based environment that aims to make learning programming easy for beginners, especially teenagers.
* Karel, Karel&quot;++&quot;, and Karel J. Robot are languages aimed at beginners, used to control a simple robot in a city consisting of a rectangular grid of streets. While Karel is its own language, Karel++ is a version of Karel implemented in C++, while Karel J. Robot is a version of Karel implemented in Java.
* Kodu is a language that is simple and entirely icon based. It was developed by Microsoft Research as a project to encourage younger children, especially girls, to enjoy technology. Programs are composed of pages, which are divided into rules, which are further divided into conditions and actions. Conditions are evaluated simultaneously. The Kodu language is designed specifically for game development and provides specialized primitives derived from gaming scenarios. Programs are expressed in physical terms, using concepts like vision, hearing, and time to control characters behavior. The Kodu tool is available in three forms: PC as a free download in public beta and academic forms, and as a low-cost Xbox 360 Live download.
* Logo is an educational language for children designed in 1967 by Daniel G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon. Today, the language is remembered mainly for its use of &quot;turtle graphics,&quot; in which commands for movement and drawing produce line graphics using a small robot called a &quot;turtle.&quot; The language was originally conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp and only later to enable what Papert called &quot;body-syntonic reasoning&quot; where students could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle&#x27;s motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle.
* Lego Mindstorms is a line of Lego sets combining programmable bricks with electric motors, sensors, Lego bricks, and Lego Technic pieces (such as gears, axles, and beams). Mindstorms originated from the programmable sensor blocks used in the line of educational toys. The first retail version of Lego Mindstorms was released in 1998 and marketed commercially as the Robotics Invention System (RIS). The current version was released in 2006 as Lego Mindstorms NXT. A wide range of programming languages is used for the Mindstorms from Logo to BASIC to derivatives of Java, Smalltalk and C. The Lego Mindstorms approach to programming now has dedicated physical sites called Computer Clubhouses.
* Mama is an educational object oriented language designed to help young students start programming by providing all the language elements in the student&#x27;s language. Mama language is available in several languages, with both LTR and RTL language direction support. A new variant of Mama was built atop Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; development environment, supporting scripting of the 3D stage objects. This variant was designed to help young students start programming by building 3D animations and games. A document on educational programming principles explains Mama&#x27;s design considerations.
* RoboMind is a simple educational programming environment that allows beginners to program a robot. It introduces popular programming techniques along with robotics and artificial intelligence. The robot can be programmed in Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, German, English and Swedish.
* Scratch is a visual language with the goal of teaching programming concepts to children by allowing them to create projects such as games, videos, and music. It does this by simplifying code into function &quot;blocks&quot; that can be dragged and connected, then run by clicking the green flag icon. In Scratch, interactive objects, graphics, and sounds can be easily imported to a new program and combined, getting quick results. The Scratch community has developed and uploaded over 1,000,000,000 projects with over 164,000,000 being publicly shared. It is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT Media Lab.
* ScratchJr is derivative of the Scratch graphical language. It is designed for children with ages around 5-7.
* Snap! is a free open-source blocks-based graphical language implemented in JavaScript and originally derived from MIT&#x27;s Scratch. Snap! adds the ability to create new blocks and has first-class functions that enables the use of anonymous functions. It is actively maintained by UC Berkeley. The source is entirely hosted on GitHub.
* Stagecast Creator is a visual programming system based on programming by demonstration. Users demonstrate to the system what to do by moving icons on the screen, and it generates rules for the objects (characters). Users can create two-dimensional simulations that model concepts, multi-level games, and interactive stories.
* Stencyl is a visual programming and game development IDE that has been used for education and commerce. The concept of &quot;code blocks&quot; it implements is based on MIT&#x27;s Scratch visual language (listed above). It also permits the use of &quot;normal&quot; typed code (separate or intermingled) through its own API and the Haxe language.
* ToonTalk is a language and environment that looks like a video game. Computational abstractions are mapped to concrete analogs such as robots, houses, trucks, birds, nests, and boxes. It supports big integers and exact rational numbers. It is based upon concurrent constraint programming.

* Curry is a teaching language designed to amalgamate the most important declarative programming paradigms, namely functional programming (nested expressions, higher-order functions, lazy evaluation) and logic programming (logical variables, partial data structures, built-in search). It also integrates the two most important operational principles developed in the area of integrated functional logic languages: &quot;residuation&quot; and &quot;narrowing.&quot;
* Flowgorithm is a graphical authoring tool for writing and executing programs via flowcharts. The approach is designed to emphasize the algorithm rather than the syntax of a given language. The flowchart can be converted to several major languages such as C#, Java, Visual Basic .NET and Python.
* Oz is a language designed to teach computer theory. It supports most major paradigms in one language so that students can learn paradigms without having to learn multiple syntaxes. Oz contains most of the concepts of the major programming paradigms, including logic, functional (both lazy and eager), imperative, object-oriented, constraint, distributed, and concurrent programming. It has a canonical textbook, &quot;Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming&quot; (2004), and a freely available standard implementation, the Mozart Programming System.

<doc id="426663" wikidata="Q4817276" url="?curid=426663" title="USS Tang (SS-563)">
<text>USS &quot;Tang&quot; (SS/AGSS-563), the lead ship of her class, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tang.

She was the first American submarine designed (as opposed to modified) under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) for underwater performance rather than surfaced speed and handling. Key features included removing the deck guns, streamlining the outer hull, replacing the conning tower with a sail, installing new propellers designed for submerged operations, installing more air conditioning and a snorkel mast, and doubling the battery capacity.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 16 May 1947. Her keel was laid down on 18 April 1949. She was launched on 19 June 1951 sponsored by Mrs. Ernestine O&#x27;Kane, the wife of Richard H. O&#x27;Kane, and commissioned on 25 October 1951 with Commander Enders P. Huey in command.

==Service history==
Following trials and training along the east coast, the submarine was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 (SUBRON 1), Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. From her base at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Tang&quot; operated in the Hawaiian Islands, providing services to surface and air antisubmarine warfare (ASW) forces. She also conducted type training. In October 1953, &quot;Tang&quot; commenced her first overhaul which she completed in July 1954.

Upon emerging from the yard, the submarine began training for her first western Pacific deployment. That cruise began in September and ended at Pearl Harbor in March 1956. She then operated in the Hawaiian area until June, when she headed back to sea for a training cruise in Alaskan waters. &quot;Tang&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in August and, soon thereafter, began her second overhaul.

On 20 July 1956, &quot;Tang&quot; put to sea on her second deployment to the western Pacific. That deployment set the pattern for seven more between then and 1972. The submarine came under the command of the Commander, Seventh Fleet, and provided training services to units of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, the Nationalist Chinese Navy, SEATO naval forces, and the United States Navy. When not cruising Far Eastern waters, she operated among the Hawaiian Islands and underwent overhauls at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.

In May 1958 she rescued 5 CIA officers and some PRRI rebels off the western coast of Sumatra. The officers were fleeing Indonesian central government&#x27;s army after leading a failed rebellion in Sumatra.

On five occasions during those years, she cruised to the northwestern coast of North America. In March 1959, during a cold weather training cruise, &quot;Tang&quot; tested a newly developed snorkel de-icer system. In addition, the submarine provided services to the Naval Torpedo Testing Station at Keyport, Washington, and to Canadian naval forces at Esquimalt, British Columbia. She returned to the Pacific Northwest in late February 1961, following her fourth overhaul at Pearl Harbor, for shakedown training and participation in a First Fleet Exercise, SLAMEX.

Two years later, she made her third voyage to the northwestern coast of the United States; this time to join in First Fleet ASW exercises. In May and June 1964, &quot;Tang&quot; made a post-overhaul shakedown cruise to the west coast. During &quot;Tang&quot;″s return trip from the west coast shakedown cruise, the destroyers and had come under hostile fire (See Gulf of Tonkin Incident). As soon as &quot;Tang&quot; reached Pearl Harbor, she received orders to West-Pac and deployed three days later. &quot;Tang&quot; reached the Philippines 21 days later with a failed KVA, but upon making repairs went on patrol to the Straits of Formosa. She returned to Pearl Harbor in March, 1965 after completing multiple patrols supporting the Vietnam War and also in various other regions of the Western Pacific. All members of the crew received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for Vietnam. During the remainder of 1965, &quot;Tang&quot; conducted various training exercises in the Hawaiian Islands. On 1 January 1966 &quot;Tang&quot; again deployed to West-Pac in support of the Vietnam War. During one patrol, the entire crew received the Navy Expeditionary Medal. Four years and two deployments later, &quot;Tang&quot; made her fifth and last voyage to the west coast while still homeported at Pearl Harbor. Two months later, she resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands before embarking upon her eighth deployment to the western Pacific in mid-January 1969.

&quot;Tang&quot;″s ninth deployment came after a period of repairs and intense training around Hawaii and lasted from August 1970 until February 1971. Upon her return to Pearl Harbor, she resumed local operations until August, when she again entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for extensive repairs and refurbishments, extensive sail modifications, and a hull stretch during which the boat was cut completely in two and a new section inserted to provide space for an extensive sonar, electronic and ventilation modernization. The modernization included both the PUFFS passive sonar and Prairie Masker installation. At the completion of these overhauls, &quot;Tang&quot; was more than 600 tons heavier and more than 22 feet longer than when originally launched.

In May 1972, she left the yard with a new AGSS hull classification symbol and began preparation for changing home port to San Diego, California. Following ten days at sea and two at San Francisco, &quot;Tang&quot; arrived at the Naval Submarine Facility at San Diego. There, she joined Submarine Division 32 of SubRon 3. The ensuing year brought ASW operations with destroyers and air units followed by a two-month restricted availability at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard and a return to normal operations. On 2 April 1973, she put to sea for the tenth western Pacific deployment of her career. During it, she again participated in surface and air ASW exercises with units of the Seventh Fleet and of various Allied navies. After visiting Yokosuka, Sasebo, Chinhae, Kaohsiung, and Pusan, &quot;Tang&quot; returned to San Diego on 12 October 1973. She resumed local operations after a 30-day standdown period, then made preparations for a deployment to South American waters for Exercise UNITAS XV. On 2 October 1974, she headed south to conduct training exercises with surface units and submarines of the United States, Chilean, and Peruvian navies. At the completion of UNITAS XV, &quot;Tang&quot; visited Acapulco, Mexico, before returning to San Diego on 16 December, for Christmas standdown. Throughout 1975, she continued to conduct normal operations out of San Diego.

On 11 January 1976, &quot;Tang&quot; commenced overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard where she remained until completion on 20 January 1977. With the exception of a brief MIDPAC deployment in March, &quot;Tang&quot; operated out of her home port of San Diego for the remainder of 1977 and the first half of 1978. On 1 August, her home port was changed to Groton, Connecticut and her SS hull classification symbol was restored in anticipation of her forthcoming inter-fleet transfer.

&quot;Tang&quot; departed San Diego on 23 August, and, following a transit of the Panama Canal, arrived at Groton on 30 September. For the remainder of 1978, she engaged in her new primary mission-training Iranian Navy personnel as well as providing service to units of the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Tang&quot; and two of her sisters were to be transferred to Iran, but the deal was canceled due to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Instead the submarine was leased to Turkey. During this period &quot;Tang&quot; participated in a number of ASW exercises including participation in a major ASW exercise and visit to Halifax, Nova Scotia as well an exercise and visit to Guantanamo Bay Cuba.

== TCG &quot;Pirireis&quot; (S 343) ==

On 8 February 1980, the oldest diesel-electric submarine in the Navy and the last operational one in the Atlantic Fleet at that time was decommissioned. &quot;Tang&quot; was struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register (NVR) on 6 August 1987. &quot;Tang&quot; was transferred to the Turkish Navy becoming the , after Ottoman-Turkish admiral Piri Reis. &quot;Pirireis&quot; served in the Turkish Submarine Forces until she was decommissioned in August 2004. The boat is currently preserved at İnciraltı Sea Museum, in İzmir, Turkey.

<text>Viscount Chandos, of Aldershot in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and held by a branch of the Lyttelton family. It was created in 1954 for the businessman and public servant Oliver Lyttelton. He was the son of the politician and sportsman Alfred Lyttelton, eighth son of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, whose eldest son, the 5th Baron Lyttelton, also succeeded his kinsman The 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos as 8th Viscount Cobham in 1889. the title of Viscount Chandos is held by the first Viscount&#x27;s grandson, the third Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1980. He lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999, which removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament. However, in 2000 he was given a life peerage as Baron Lyttelton of Aldershot, of Aldershot in the County of Hampshire, and was thus able to return to the House of Lords, where he now sits on the Labour benches. Lord Chandos is also in remainder to the viscountcy of Cobham and its subsidiary titles the barony of Cobham, the barony of Lyttelton, the barony of Westcote and the baronetcy of Frankley.

<doc id="426670" wikidata="Q3544060" url="?curid=426670" title="USS Tang (SS-306)">
<text>USS &quot;Tang&quot; (SS-306) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine of World War II, the first ship of the United States Navy to bear the name Tang. She was built and launched in 1943, serving until being sunk by her own torpedo off China in the Taiwan Strait on 24 October 1944.

In her short career in the Pacific War, &quot;Tang&quot; sank 33 ships totalling 116,454 tons. Commander Richard O&#x27;Kane received the Medal of Honor for her last two engagements (23 and 24 October 1944).

&quot;Tang&quot; was sunk during the last engagement by a circular run of her final torpedo, going down in of water. 78 men were lost, and the 9 survivors were picked up by a Japanese frigate and taken prisoner of war. This was the only known time that a Momsen lung was used to escape a sunken submarine.

==Construction==
The contract to build USS &quot;Tang&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 15 December 1941, and her keel was laid down on 15 January 1943. She was launched on 17 August sponsored by Mrs. Alix M. Pitre, wife of Captain Antonio S. Pitre, Director of Research at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and commissioned on 15 October 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Richard O&#x27;Kane, former executive officer of , in command, and delivered to the Navy on 30 November 1943.

&quot;Tang&quot; completed fitting out at Mare Island and moved south to San Diego for 18 days of training before sailing for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1944 and conducted two more weeks of exercises in preparation for combat.

==First war patrol==
&quot;Tang&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 22 January 1944 to begin her first war patrol, destined for the Caroline Islands-Mariana Islands area. On the morning of 17 February, she sighted a convoy of two freighters, five smaller ships, and their escort. The submarine tracked the convoy, plotted its course, and then prepared to attack. An escort suddenly appeared at a range of and closing. &quot;Tang&quot; went deep and received five depth charges before the escort departed. Unscathed, she returned to periscope depth and resumed the attack. The range on the nearest freighter closed to , and &quot;Tang&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes. Three hit, and &quot;Gyoten Maru&quot; (6,800 tons) sank by the stern. The submarine cleared the area by running deep and then attempted to get ahead of the convoy for a dawn attack, but the remaining freighter passed out of range, protected by aircraft.

During the night of 22 February, &quot;Tang&quot; made a surface attack on a convoy of three cargo ships and two escorts. She tracked the Japanese ships, through rain squalls which made radar almost useless, for 30 minutes before attaining a firing position, on the surface, off the port bow of a freighter. A spread of four torpedoes hit &quot;Fukuyama Maru&quot; (3,600 tons) from bow to stern, and the enemy ship disintegrated. Early the next morning, &quot;Tang&quot; made another approach on the convoy. The escort of the lead ship, the 6,800 ton &quot;Yamashimo Maru&quot;, moved from its covering position on the port bow, and the submarine slipped into it and fired four more torpedoes. The first hit the stern of the merchantman, the second just aft of the stack; and the third just forward of the bridge, producing a terrific secondary explosion. The ship was &quot;twisted, lifted from the water&quot;, and began spouting flames as she sank.

On the morning of 24 February, &quot;Tang&quot; sighted a tanker, a freighter, and a destroyer. Rain squalls hampered her as she attempted to attain a good firing position, so she tracked the ships until after nightfall, then made a surface attack. She launched four torpedoes and scored three hits which sank the &quot;Tatutaki Maru&quot;-class freighter. The two remaining ships commenced firing in all directions, and &quot;Tang&quot; submerged to begin evasive action. She shadowed the enemy until morning and then closed the tanker for a submerged attack from extremely close range, just , barely enough to allow her torpedoes to arm. Additional lookouts had been posted on the target&#x27;s deck and, when the spread of torpedoes from &quot;Tang&quot; struck her, they were hurled into the air with other debris from the ship. &quot;Echizen Maru&quot; sank in four minutes as &quot;Tang&quot; went deep and rigged for the depth charge attack that followed. During this evasion, a water leak developed in the forward torpedo room, and &quot;Tang&quot; exceeded her depth gauge maximum reading of 612 feet. The crew was able to get the submarine back under control and eventually return to the surface. (Postwar, JANAC denied credit for the tanker seen to explode.)

&quot;Tang&quot; contacted a convoy consisting of a freighter, transport, and four escorts on the evening of 26 February. She maneuvered into position to attack the wildly zigzagging transport and fired her last four torpedoes and believed she missed; JANAC credited her with sinking &quot;Choko Maru&quot;, a 1794-ton cargo ship. Having expended all 24 of her torpedoes and scored 16 hits, the submarine arrived at Midway for refit.

==Second war patrol==

&quot;Tang&quot;″s second patrol began on 16 March and took her to waters around the Palau Islands, to Davao Gulf, and to the approaches to Truk. She made five surface contacts, but had no chance to make any attacks. She was then assigned to lifeguard duty near Truk. &quot;Tang&quot; rescued 22 downed airmen, including some rescued by John Burns&#x27; Vought OS2U Kingfisher, and took them to Hawaii at the end of the patrol.

==Third war patrol==
&quot;Tang&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 8 June and stalked enemy shipping in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea areas. On 24 June, southwest of Kagoshima, the submarine contacted a convoy of six large ships guarded by 16 escorts. &quot;Tang&quot; closed for a surface attack and fired a spread of three torpedoes at one of the ships and then fired a similar spread at a second target. Explosions followed, and &quot;Tang&quot; reported two ships sunk. However, postwar examination of Japanese records revealed by the Japanese government show that two passenger-cargo ships and two freighters were sunk. The ships must have overlapped, and the torpedo spread must have hit and sunk two victims in addition to their intended targets. Those sunk – &quot;Tamahoko Maru&quot;, &quot;Tainan Maru&quot;, &quot;Nasusan Maru&quot;, and &quot;Kennichi Maru&quot; – added up to 16,292 tons of enemy shipping.

On 30 June, while she patrolled the lane from Kyūshū to Dairen, &quot;Tang&quot; sighted another cargo ship steaming without escort. After making an end around run on the surface which produced two torpedo misses, &quot;Tang&quot; went deep to avoid depth charges, then surfaced and chased the target until she closed the range to . A single torpedo blew in half, and the transport ship sank, taking with her some 3,200 Japanese soldiers.

The next morning, &quot;Tang&quot; sighted a tanker and a freighter. While she sank the freighter &quot;Taiun Maru Number Two&quot;, the tanker &quot;Takatori Maru Number One&quot; fled. The submarine trailed the latter until dark, then she launched two torpedoes which sank the tanker. &quot;Tang&quot; celebrated 4 July at dawn by an end-around, submerged attack on an enemy freighter which was near shore. However, with rapidly shoaling water and her keel about to touch bottom, &quot;Tang&quot; drew back, fired a spread of three with two hits, and then surfaced as survivors of the 6,886 ton cargo ship &quot;Asukazan Maru&quot; were being rescued by fishing boats. That afternoon, &quot;Tang&quot; sighted &quot;Yamaoka Maru&quot;, another cargo ship of approximately the same size, and sank her with two torpedoes. The submarine surfaced and, with the aid of grapnel hooks and Thompson submachine guns, rescued a survivor who had been clinging to an overturned lifeboat. While prowling the waters off Dairen late the next night, the submarine sighted a cargo ship and, during a submerged attack with her last two torpedoes, sank &quot;Dori Maru&quot;. Credited with eight ships for 56,000 tons at the time, the score confirmed postwar by JANAC for her third patrol was 10 ships for a total of 39,160 tons.

==Fourth war patrol==
&quot;Tang&quot;&#x27;s fourth war patrol was conducted from 31 July – 3 September in Japanese home waters off the coast of Honshū. On 10 August, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a tanker near the beach of Omaezaki but scored no hits. The next day, after locating two freighters and two escorts, she launched three torpedoes at the larger freighter and two at the other. The larger freighter (&quot;Roko Maru&quot;) disintegrated, apparently due to a torpedo which exploded in her boilers. As the submarine went deep, her crew heard the fourth and fifth torpedoes hit the second ship. After a jarring depth charge attack which lasted 38 minutes, &quot;Tang&quot; returned to periscope depth. Only the two escorts were in sight, and one of them was picking up survivors.

On 14 August, &quot;Tang&quot; attacked a patrol yacht with her deck gun and reduced the Japanese ship&#x27;s deck house to a shambles with eight hits. Eight days later, she sank a patrol boat (&quot;No. 2 Nansatsu Maru&quot;). On 23 August, the submarine closed in on a large ship; Japanese crewmen dressed in white uniforms could be seen lining its superstructure and the bridge. She fired three torpedoes, and two hits caused the 8,135 ton transport &quot;Tsukushi Maru&quot; to sink. Two days later, &quot;Tang&quot; attacked a tanker and an escort with her last three torpedoes, sinking the tanker, &quot;No. 8 Nanko Maru&quot;. &quot;Tang&quot; then returned to Pearl Harbor.

==Fifth war patrol and loss==

After a refit, &quot;Tang&quot; stood out to sea on 24 September for her fifth war patrol. After topping off her fuel at Midway Island, she sailed for the Formosa Strait on 27 September. In order to reach her area, &quot;Tang&quot; had to pass through narrow waters known to be heavily patrolled by the Japanese. A large area stretching northeast from Formosa was known to have been mined by the enemy, and O&#x27;Kane was given the choice of making the passage north of the island alone, or joining a coordinated attack group (, , and , under Commander John S. Coye, Jr., flag in &quot;Silversides&quot;) which was to patrol off northeast Formosa, and making the passage with them. &quot;Tang&quot; chose to make the passage alone and these vessels never heard from &quot;Tang&quot;, nor did any base, after she left Midway.

The story of &quot;Tang&quot;″s fate comes from the report of her surviving commanding officer.

On the night of 10–11 October, &quot;Tang&quot; sank the cargo ships &quot;Joshu Go&quot; and &quot;Ōita Maru&quot;. The submarine continued on patrol until 23 October, when she contacted a large convoy consisting of three tankers, a transport, a freighter, and numerous escorts. Commander O&#x27;Kane planned a night surface attack. &quot;Tang&quot; broke into the middle of the formation, firing torpedoes as she closed on the tankers (later identified as freighters). Two torpedoes struck under the stack and engine room of the nearest, a single burst into the stern of the middle one, and two exploded under the stack and engine space of the farthest. The first torpedoes began exploding before the last was fired, and all hit their targets, which were soon either burning or sinking. As the submarine prepared to fire at the tanker which was crossing her stern, she sighted the transport bearing down on her in an attempt to ram. &quot;Tang&quot; had no room to dive, so she crossed the transport&#x27;s bow and with full left rudder saved her stern and got inside the transport&#x27;s turning circle. The transport was forced to continue her swing to avoid the tanker, which had also been coming in to ram. The tanker struck the transport&#x27;s starboard quarter shortly after the submarine fired four stern torpedoes along their double length at a range of . The tanker sank bow first and the transport had a 30° up-angle. With escorts approaching on the port bow and beam and a destroyer closing on the port quarter, &quot;Tang&quot; rang up full speed and headed for open water. When the submarine was from the transport, another explosion was observed, and its bow disappeared.

On the morning of 24 October, &quot;Tang&quot; began patrolling at periscope depth. She surfaced at dark and headed for Turnabout Island (). On approaching the island, the submarine&#x27;s surface search radar showed so many blips that it was almost useless. &quot;Tang&quot; soon identified a large convoy which contained tankers with planes on their decks and transports with crated planes stacked on their bows and sterns. As the submarine tracked the Japanese ships along the coast, the convoy&#x27;s escorts became suspicious, and the escort commander began signaling with a large searchlight. This illuminated the convoy, and &quot;Tang&quot; chose a large three-deck transport as her first target, a smaller transport as the second, and a large tanker as the third. Their ranges varied from . After firing two torpedoes at each target, the submarine paralleled the convoy to choose its next victims. She fired stern torpedoes at another transport and tanker aft.

As &quot;Tang&quot; poured on full speed to escape the gunfire directed at her, a destroyer passed around the stern of the transport and headed for the submarine. The tanker exploded, and a hit was seen on the transport. A few seconds later, the destroyer exploded, either from intercepting &quot;Tang&quot;″s third torpedo or from shell fire of two escorts closing on the beam. Only the transport remained afloat, dead in the water. The submarine cleared to , rechecked the last two torpedoes which had been loaded in the bow tubes, and returned to finish off the transport. The 23rd torpedo was fired at and was observed running hot, straight, and normal. &quot;Tang&quot;″s score for the night would later be confirmed as the freighters &quot;Kogen Maru&quot; (6,600 tons) and &quot;Matsumoto Maru&quot; (7,000 tons).

At 02:30 on the morning of 25 October, the 24th and last torpedo (a Mark 18 electric torpedo) was fired. It broached and curved to the left in a circular run. &quot;Tang&quot; fishtailed under emergency power to clear the turning circle of the torpedo, but it struck her abreast the aft torpedo room approximately 20 seconds after it was fired. The explosion was violent, and men as far forward as the control room received broken limbs. The ship went down by the stern with the aft three compartments flooded. Of the nine officers and men on the bridge, including O&#x27;Kane, three were able to swim through the night until picked up eight hours later. One officer escaped from the flooded conning tower and was rescued with the others.

The submarine bottomed at and the thirty survivors crowded into the forward torpedo room as the aft compartments flooded, intending to use the forward escape trunk. Publications were burned, and all assembled in the forward room to escape. The escape was delayed by a Japanese patrol which dropped depth charges, and started an electrical fire in the forward battery. Beginning at 6:00 am on 25 October, using the Momsen lung, the only known case where it was used, thirteen men escaped from the forward torpedo room. By the time the last had exited, the heat from the battery fire was so intense, paint on the bulkhead was scorching, melting, and running down. Of the 13 men who escaped from the forward torpedo room, only 5 were rescued. One sailor who was near the group of five but injured during the ascent was not rescued. Three who were on the bridge were rescued after swimming for 8 hours. Another survivor escaped the conning tower and used his pants as a flotation device. A total of 78 men were lost. Those who escaped the submarine were greeted in the morning by the sight of the bow of the transport they sank the previous night sticking straight out of the water.

One of the 78 men lost was Rubin MacNiel Raiford, who at age 15, may have been the youngest American person in the military to lose his life in combat.

Nine survivors, including O&#x27;Kane, were picked up the next morning by Japanese frigate . Survivors of &quot;Tang&quot;″s previous sinkings were on board, and they beat the men from &quot;Tang&quot;. O&#x27;Kane stated, &quot;When we realized that our clubbing and kickings were being administered by the burned, mutilated survivors of our handiwork, we found we could take it with less prejudice.&quot;
The nine captives were placed in a prison camp at Ōfuna until the end of the war, where they were interrogated by Japanese intelligence.

&quot;Tang&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 February 1945. As is tradition for US submarines lost at sea, &quot;Tang&quot; was not decommissioned and officially remains on &quot;Eternal Patrol&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Tang&quot; received four battle stars and two Presidential Unit Citations for World War II service. Her commanding officer, Richard O&#x27;Kane, received the Medal of Honor for &quot;Tang&quot;″s final combat action.

During the war, &quot;Tang&quot; was credited with sinking 31 ships in her five patrols, totaling 227,800 tons, and damaging two for 4,100 tons. This was unequaled among American submarines. Postwar comparison with Japanese records by the Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC) reduced this to 24 ships, totaling 93,824 tons, placing her second on the list for ships sunk after (with 26) and fourth behind , , and for total confirmed tonnage. These figures have since been revised to 33 ships totalling 116,454 tons, placing her first in the list of the most successful American submarines in World War II for both number of ships and tonnage. &quot;Tang&quot; also retains the best patrol by number of ships sunk, her third, with ten for 39,100 tons.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1951 movie &quot;Submarine Command&quot;, the opening scenes show a submarine with the hull number SS-306 in the mothball fleet at Mare Island. For the film, SS-306 is named &quot;Tiger Shark&quot;, and is portrayed by , another &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine.
* &quot;Tang&quot; was the subject of two episodes of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, which aired during the 1957–1958 season. The two episodes depict &quot;Tang&quot;&#x27;s second and fifth patrols. &quot;Tang&quot; is also featured in the episode &quot;Fatal Voyage&quot; of the Smithsonian Channel series &quot;Hell Below&quot;.
* &quot;Tang&quot; is one of several submarines (along with the era&#x27;s USS &quot;Bowfin&quot;, &quot;Growler&quot;, &quot;Seawolf&quot;, and &quot;Spadefish&quot;) whose war patrols can be re-enacted in the 1985 MicroProse computer game &quot;Silent Service&quot; and the game&#x27;s various ports, including Konami&#x27;s 1989 release for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
* &quot;Tang&quot; also appears as a playable submarine during a quick mission in &quot;Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific&quot;.
* The sinking of the &quot;Tang&quot; was the subject of the 2010 musical piece &quot;Escape from the Deep&quot; by composer Brian Balmages.
*Diagrams from the report into the sinking of the USS &quot;Tang&quot; made a brief appearance in the 2023 film &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; to represent the USS &quot;Redfish&quot;, which was destroyed during its pursuit of Godzilla when one of its torpedoes performed a circular run. 
*In the documentary series&quot; Hell Under the Sea&quot; by National Geographic, the &quot; USS Tang&quot; was the plot for episode three, season one.

==Museums==
&quot;Tang&quot; has been memorialized as part of a special interactive exhibit at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, called &quot;Final Mission&quot;. Visitors enter into a simulated re-creation of the submarine, are given a card corresponding to one of the 87 men who crewed the boat during its fifth (and final) patrol, and are assigned a station to crew. The events of 24–25 October 1944 are depicted on an overhead screen, while the visitor &quot;crew&quot; is given tasks to complete. The recreation includes the circular run of the 24th torpedo, which returned to hit &quot;Tang&quot; and sink the boat. Upon exiting the simulator, visitors see a wall with pictures of the crew, and can learn if the sailor associated with their card survived the attack.

<doc id="426677" wikidata="Q391300" url="?curid=426677" title="Nick Gibb">
<text>Sir Nicolas John Gibb (born 3 September 1960) is a British politician who served as Minister of State for Schools from 2010 to 2012; 2014 to 2021 and from 2022 to 2023. He has served at the Department for Education under Conservative Prime Ministers David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. A member of the Conservative Party, Gibb served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton from 1997 to 2024.

Gibb was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and was educated at the College of St Hild and St Bede at the University of Durham. After unsuccessfully campaigning to become an MP in Stoke-on-Trent Central at the 1992 general election and Rotherham in the 1994 by-election, Gibb was elected to the British House of Commons for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton at the 1997 general election.

Gibb was Shadow Minister for Schools from 2005 to 2010. He was appointed Minister of State for Schools by Prime Minister David Cameron, serving from May 2010 and September 2012. After serving as a backbencher for two years, Gibb returned to government as Minister of State for School Reform in July 2014. Gibb&#x27;s portfolio returned to its previous name as Minister of State for Schools after the 2015 general election. He retained this position during the premiership of Theresa May, though it was retitled Minister of State for School Standards. He was retained as Minister of State for School Standards by May&#x27;s successor, Boris Johnson; Gibb was removed from the role by Johnson in September 2021. He returned as Minister of State for Schools under Rishi Sunak in October 2022 and voluntarily left Government in the November 2023 reshuffle.

== Early life and career ==
Nicolas Gibb was born on 3 September 1960 in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and was educated at the private Bedford Modern School, the grammar school Maidstone Grammar School, the comprehensive Roundhay School in Leeds, and Thornes House School in Wakefield. In an interview regarding his education, Gibb spoke of how he believed Maidstone Grammar School to be the best. &quot;What was good about it was that it was rigorous&quot; he told Teachers TV in 2006. &quot;Every lesson was rigorous, even things like music: it was taught in the same way as chemistry&quot;. Wakefield, by contrast, was &quot;terrible&quot; due to its lack of rigour. Upon leaving school he took a job as a handyman in a London hotel, spending his evenings in the House of Commons watching late-night debates from the public gallery.

He then attended the College of St Hild and St Bede at the University of Durham where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Law in 1981. Gibb was a member of the Federation of Conservative Students at a time when they were influenced by radical libertarian ideas. He stood for election to the NUS committee in 1981, but only achieved a single vote after accusing the NUS of openly supporting terrorist organisations.

After leaving university Gibb was implicated in a scandal involving nomination papers for elections at the 1982 NUS conference in Blackpool, with Gibb accused of forging signatures to get Conservative candidates on to the ballot. Gibb and his brother Robbie were recruited and trained by the Russian anticommunist organisation the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists. In 1982, Gibb joined NatWest as a trainee accountant, before working on Kibbutz Merom Golan in 1983. In 1984 he joined KPMG as a chartered accountant until his election to parliament. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (FCA).

Gibb stood as the Conservative candidate in Stoke-on-Trent Central at the 1992 general election, coming second with 27.9% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Mark Fisher. 

In 1994, Gibb stood in the Rotherham by-election, coming third with 9.9% of the vote behind the Labour candidate Denis MacShane and the Liberal Democrat candidate.

== Political career ==
At the 1997 general election, Gibb was elected to Parliament as MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton with 44.2% of the vote and a majority of 7,321. He made his maiden speech on 4 July 1997.

Shortly after his election, Gibb joined the opposition frontbench of William Hague when he was appointed as the spokesman on trade and industry in 1997, before joining the social security select committee later in the year. The following year, in 1998 he rejoined the frontbench as a spokesman on the treasury, moving back to trade and industry in 1999.

Gibb was reportedly involved in the faction-fight between supporters of William Hague and Michael Portillo, the then shadow chancellor, as a supporter of Portillo.

At the 2001 general election, Gibb was re-elected as MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton with an increased vote share of 45.2% and a decreased majority of 5,643.

Following the election, Gibb was briefly a spokesman on environment, transport and the regions but resigned under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith, reportedly because he was unhappy at his new role. 

Gibb was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 44.6% and an increased majority of 7,822.

Michael Howard brought Gibb back to the frontbench in 2005 as a spokesman for Education and Young People. Shortly afterwards, the newly elected Conservative Party Leader, David Cameron, promoted Gibb from within the education team to Shadow Minister for Schools.

Gibb is a longstanding advocate of synthetic phonics as a method of teaching children to read, having first publicly raised this in 2006.

At the 2010 general election, Gibb was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 51.4% and an increased majority of 13,063.

After the formation of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, Gibb was appointed Minister of State for Schools in the new Department for Education. He was sacked in a reshuffle in September 2012, but returned to the same department, again as a Minister of State, in July 2014. 

Just days after being appointed as Minister for Schools in 2010, Gibb was criticised by teachers and educationalists after leaked information suggested he had told officials at the Department of Education that he &quot;would rather have a physics graduate from Oxbridge without a PGCE teaching in a school than a physics graduate from one of the rubbish universities with a PGCE&quot;.

In 2012 Gibb was reported to have described attempts to include public speaking classes intending to foster empowerment among public students as &quot;encouraging idle chatter in class&quot;. This statement was criticised by researchers at both Cambridge University and the Education Endowment Foundation who observed a link between public speaking classes and improved academic results and economic potential.

He was sacked in a reshuffle in September 2012, but returned to the same department, again as a Minister of State, in July 2014. 

Gibb was again re-elected at the 2015 general election, with a decreased vote share of 51.3% and an increased majority of 13,944.

He supported the Remain campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In November of the same year, he was appointed to the Privy Council.

At the snap 2017 general election, Gibb was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 59% and an increased majority of 17,494. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election with an increased vote share of 63.5% and an increased majority of 22,503.

In July 2020, as Minister of State for School Standards his department oversaw the controversial derivation of A-level grades in place of exams cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The system was subsequently described as having the effect of &quot;people who come from areas where people have scored low are assumed to score low this year, and people who come from areas where people have scored high are assumed to score high this year&quot;. He was later confronted on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Any Questions?&quot; by a student stating that Gibb had &quot;ruined my life&quot;. Gibb responded by saying: &quot;It won&#x27;t ruin your life, it will be sorted, I can assure you.&quot;

Gibb was sacked by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the September 2021 reshuffle and returned to the back benches.

On 4 February 2022, Gibb called for the Prime Minister to resign over Partygate. It was reported he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson to the chairman of the 1922 Committee.

Gibbs was re-appointed as Schools Minister on 26 October 2022 by Rishi Sunak. His resigned this post on 13 November 2023, and announced that he would stand down from Parliament at the 2024 general election. This was after he had been reselected in March.

== Personal life ==
Gibb is the brother of Sir Robbie Gibb, a former PR consultant and ex-editor of the BBC&#x27;s political programmes, &quot;The Daily Politics&quot; and (in an executive capacity) &quot;This Week&quot;, who was announced as Director of Communications for Prime Minister Theresa May in July 2017.

In May 2015, Gibb came out as gay and announced his engagement to Michael Simmonds, the chief executive of the Populus polling organisation. Having been together for 29 years they married in 2015.

<text>Dame Cheryl Elise Kendall Gillan (; 21 April 1952 – 4 April 2021) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Chesham and Amersham from 1992 until her death in 2021. A member of the Conservative Party, she served as Secretary of State for Wales from 2010 to 2012.

Before her parliamentary career, Gillan was a marketing executive for several companies. She was first elected to the House of Commons in 1992 and served as an MP for 29 years. She was a junior minister for Education and Employment from 1995 to 1997 in John Major&#x27;s government. In opposition, she served as a Conservative whip and as a spokesperson for Trade and Industry, foreign affairs and home affairs. She was the Shadow Welsh Secretary from 2005 to 2010. She served in David Cameron&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales after the 2010 general election until a reshuffle in September 2012. She was awarded a damehood in the 2018 New Year Honours.

== Early life ==
Cheryl Elise Kendall Gillan was born in Llandaff, a district of Cardiff, in 1952. Her father, Major Adam Mitchell Gillan, was a former British Army officer and a director of a steel company, while her mother, Mona Elsie Freeman, was a Wren. She was brought up in South Wales and her family farms near Usk. She was educated at Elm Tree House and Norfolk House primary schools in Cardiff before her family left Wales when she was aged 11. Gillan attended the independent Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College and the College of Law. She was a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing.

== Business career ==
Gillan joined the International Management Group in 1977 before becoming a director with the British Film Year in 1984. In 1986, she was appointed a senior marketing consultant at Ernst &amp; Young before becoming a marketing director with Kidsons Impey from 1991 to 1993. She became a Freeman of the City of London in 1991 and was a member of the Livery of the Worshipful Company of Marketors.

== Political career ==
Gillan was chairman of the Bow Group from 1987 to 1988. She unsuccessfully contested the Greater Manchester Central seat in the 1989 European Parliament election. She was elected to the House of Commons in the 1992 general election for the Buckinghamshire seat of Chesham and Amersham. She won the seat with a majority of 22,220 and remained the MP until her death. She made her maiden speech on 25 June 1992.

In her early years in Parliament, Gillan served on the select committees for Science and Technology (1992–1995) and for Procedure (1994–1995). She was also the Secretary to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Space and a board member of the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology in 1995. In 1994, she was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal, Viscount Cranborne.

In July 1995, Gillan joined the government as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Education and Employment. In this role, she expanded the specialist schools programme to include Arts and Sports colleges, something she considered to be one of her proudest achievements in politics. After the 1997 general election – with the Conservative Party now in Opposition – she became a spokesperson for Trade and Industry as well as for education in June 1997 (with there being so few Conservative frontbenchers left that several held more than one shadow post). During this time, she opposed the abolition of the Assisted Places Scheme. From June 1998, shadow minister for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and International Development. From September 2001 until June 2003, she served in the whip&#x27;s office. In December 2003, she became a shadow minister for Home, Constitutional and Legal Affairs.

Gillan represented the British Islands and the Mediterranean on the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) from 2000 until 2003 and was later elected treasurer of the CPA from 2003 until 2006. She was a member of the Parliamentary Association of NATO from 2003 to 2005.

She was the Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Autism, and responsible for introducing the Autism Act 2009 through a Private Member&#x27;s Bill.

=== Shadow Welsh Secretary (2005–2010) ===
Gillan was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet in December 2005 as Shadow Secretary of State for Wales. She was initially opposed to the creation of the National Assembly for Wales, saying that there was not a large enough majority in favour of it in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum. However, after becoming Shadow Welsh Secretary, she declared that she supported the Welsh Assembly, and had maintained the possibility of the Conservatives supporting the devolution of additional powers. She said in 2008, however, that the Conservative Party was divided on the issue of devolution and criticised the state of devolution in Wales as being &quot;complex and cumbersome&quot;.

=== Welsh Secretary (2010–2012) ===
Gillan was appointed by David Cameron as Secretary of State for Wales in the new coalition government formed from the 2010 general election. She was appointed a Privy Councillor on 13 May 2010.

As Secretary of State for Wales, her aides included:

* Parliamentary Private Secretary: Glyn Davies MP
* Special adviser: Richard Hazlewood

Welsh-related government policy decisions taken during Gillan&#x27;s term in the Wales Office included:
* the running of the 2011 Welsh devolution referendum on direct law-making powers for the Assembly;
* setting up of the Silk Commission on future Welsh devolution;
* rail electrification of the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line;
* reduction of S4C funding;
* cancellation of the plan to centralise military training at MOD St Athan.

In May 2012, Gillan unveiled a Wales Office green paper that proposed to cut the number of constituency Assembly members (AMs) from 40 to 30, with another 30 coming from regional lists. The Welsh Government opposed this idea, and it was reported that Conservative AMs preferred the status quo.

Gillan ceased to be Welsh Secretary following a major Cabinet reshuffle on 4 September 2012, although she wished to continue in the role. She was replaced by David Jones who had been Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales; there had been pressure from Welsh Conservative MPs, AMs and activists for her successor to be an MP from a Welsh constituency.

=== High Speed 2 ===
Gillan strongly opposed the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway project. Gillan&#x27;s constituency lay on the proposed route for the rail line. In a parliamentary debate before the 2010 election, Gillan said that she agreed with neighbouring MP David Lidington who described the planned route as an &quot;outrage&quot;. When campaigning for re-election, Gillan said that HS2 would be &quot;a lot more than just the blight on the properties nearby... the implications for the area will be absolutely phenomenal&quot;. She also described HS2 as a project that would &quot;threaten the quality of our lives – not just now but for generations to come&quot; and stated that she &quot;would defy the party whip – be very, very sure of that&quot;.

On 12 January 2012, Secretary of State for Transport Justine Greening confirmed in a House of Commons statement that HS2 would go ahead and, in responding to questions, stated that it was her understanding that &quot;the Welsh Secretary is already on side ... I thoroughly agree with her that we have ended up with the right line, with the right mitigation&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot; following the announcement, Gillan stated: &quot;[W]e&#x27;ve already got some changes, good changes and I&#x27;m looking at what further possibilities there will be&quot;. When asked whether she would remain in the Cabinet, Gillan stated: &quot;I am not resigning. The speculation on my resignation has always come from the press and my political opponents... I&#x27;m exceedingly loyal to my party and my Government and I will remain so&quot;.

Three days after the announcement, it was discovered that Gillan had sold her house – less than a mile from the proposed route – in November 2011 because she and her husband, John, had &quot;mobility problems&quot;. Following the revelations, Labour called for Gillan to be investigated for a possible breach of the Ministerial Code.

=== 1922 Committee ===
In May 2019, Gillan and Charles Walker became acting chairs of the 1922 Committee after Graham Brady resigned from the role while mulling a Conservative leadership bid. They stood down when Brady returned to the position in September of that year.

== Expenses ==
In 2009, Gillan was criticised for her expenses claims. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed she had claimed for dog food on her second home allowance. Gillan described the claim as a &quot;mistake&quot; and said she would be repaying it. Gillan also claimed £305.50 to cure &quot;noise problems&quot; with her boiler. When questioned, Gillan said the boiler had broken down, and the claim was within the rules. It was also revealed that Gillan had attempted to claim more money for her gas bill than it was worth; the Commons Fees Office refused to pay the full amount.

Gillan was also the subject of criticism from the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot; in 2010, which revealed Gillan had claimed £8,450 for food and £4,335 for cleaning. It was also revealed that Gillan employed her husband, then aged 82, as an &quot;Office Manager/Researcher&quot;. Gillan wrote to the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot; to complain that &quot;insinuating language&quot; had been used. Following a review of MPs expenses by Sir Thomas Legg, Gillan was also found to have claimed £1,884 more than her mortgage bill was actually worth. The mortgage was on a second home in Battersea, even though, at the time, she had a home in her constituency, which lies on the London Underground network. Gillan was ordered to repay the money. On 30 March 2010, it was announced that future MPs from Gillan&#x27;s constituency would not be allowed to claim for a second home after the 2010 election.

== Personal life ==
Gillan was married to John Coates &quot;Jack&quot; Leeming from 1985 until his death, aged 91, on 23 March 2019. Her interests included singing (she was a member of the Parliamentary Choir), gardening, golf and keeping chickens. Before her death, Gillan lived in Epsom, Surrey. She was a member of the Royal Automobile Club.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gillan became one of many MPs who participated virtually and pushed for reforms to allow electronic voting for members unable to sit in the chamber, especially when she became too ill to attend due to her advancing breast cancer. She died from cancer on 4 April 2021, at the age of 68. Tributes were paid to her in the House of Commons on 13 April. In the subsequent by-election held on 17 June, her former seat was gained by Sarah Green of the Liberal Democrats.

<text>Roger Duncan Godsiff (born 28 June 1946) is a British former politician who served as the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) from 1992 to 2019, for the seats of Birmingham Small Heath, Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath, and Birmingham Hall Green.

In October 2019, Hall Green Constituency Labour Party members overwhelmingly voted to open selections for their Parliamentary Candidate, with votes of 86 to 6 in Moseley and Kings Heath Branch and 37 to 11 in Hall Green Branch to have the option to choose a candidate other than Roger Godsiff. This followed several years of controversy about the MP&#x27;s stances, including voting with the Conservative Party on key Brexit votes, and outspokenly opposing LGBT+ Inclusive Education in Birmingham schools. Godsiff subsequently declared his intention to stand as an independent candidate. He lost the seat to the Labour Party candidate, Tahir Ali, coming third behind Labour and the Conservatives.

==Early life==
Roger Godsiff was born in London and educated at Catford Comprehensive School.

He was a bank clerk for five years from 1965, joining the Labour Party in 1966.

He was a political officer from 1970 with the trade union APEX and then from 1990 with its successor the GMB until his election to Parliament in 1992. During his time as a trade union official, he was a member of the St Ermin&#x27;s group, a secret caucus of moderate trade unionists who moved the Labour Party back towards the political centre by organising slates for elections to the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

==Political career==
Elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham in 1971, he became the Mayor of Lewisham for 1977–78, before quitting the council at the 1990 London Borough elections. He unsuccessfully contested Birmingham Yardley at the 1983 general election, where he finished in second place behind the sitting Conservative MP David Gilroy Bevan. He was elected to the House of Commons for Birmingham Small Heath at the 1992 general election following the retirement of Denis Howell. Godsiff held Small Heath with a majority of 13,989 votes and remained an MP from that point. His constituency was abolished in 1997 and, aided by the retirement of Birmingham Sparkbrook MP Roy Hattersley, Godsiff was elected for the newly combined constituency of Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath at the 1997 general election.

The Sparkbrook and Small Heath seat was abolished at the 2010 election, with its constituent parts moving into neighbouring seats. Godsiff was selected for the redrawn Birmingham Hall Green seat in 2008, which includes some of his existing constituency and wards which were formerly in the two Birmingham constituencies of Hall Green and Selly Oak. He was re-elected at the May 2010 general election with a majority of 3,799.

In Parliament he was a special adviser to the former Minister of Sport Richard Caborn on cricket and was the chairman of the All Party Japan Group. In October 2006, Godsiff was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War. He also rebelled against the government in November 2005 on legislation permitting the detention of terrorist suspects for 90 days without trial.

In January 2005, Godsiff called for economic migration to the UK to be &quot;stopped&quot;. He said that economic migration was unnecessary and it posed a danger to race relations within the UK.

In the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, Godsiff was reported as using office expenses for extensive roofing work, rewiring, replacement guttering and even clock repair at a property he owns. He incurred the second highest expenses of all 647 MPs&#x27; for 2008/2009 with claims for £189,338.

Andy McSmith&#x27;s book &quot;Faces of Labour&quot; (1996), contends that Godsiff obtained selection for his seat in 1992 by dubious means which, although accepted by the Labour Party, were too late to act upon. In 2005, &quot;Tribune&quot; made similar allegations about his successful bid to stave off deselection, which was only thwarted by the local votes of his former employer, the GMB Union. Godsiff had angered many in his local party by his calls for curbs on immigration.

During the 2010 general election campaign, Godsiff issued leaflets suggesting the Liberal Democrats were in favour of &quot;convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles to be given the vote&quot;, which the Lib Dems denied was their policy. The leaflets contained images of various high-profile criminals, including child sex offender and nursery worker Vanessa George and serial killer Steven Wright. Labour&#x27;s general secretary Ray Collins said the leaflet was not approved at a national level and the local campaign was later scrapped.

In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; declared that, based on his participation in votes, Godsiff was &quot;Britain&#x27;s laziest MP&quot;, being absent from 88% of votes at the start of that year. He had attended less than 50% of parliamentary debates during his whole time in office and refused to take any part in hustings meetings. He responded to the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; about his participation, saying, &quot;when you are in opposition and the government has a substantial majority, you know perfectly well that you aren&#x27;t going to be able to have an effect on every vote&quot;.

In May 2013, Godsiff voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales. Godsiff advised he opposed the &quot;redefining the current definition of marriage.&quot;

Godsiff was one of seven signatories in 2014 of an open letter to Ed Miliband calling upon him to commit to restricting the ability of workers from low income EU countries to move to the UK.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Godsiff supported the Leave campaign, although his constituency voted by 66.4% to remain in the European Union. Unusually for a pro-Brexit MP, he abstained from the vote to invoke Article 50, which would commence the UK&#x27;s process of withdrawal from the EU, on the grounds that he was respecting his constituents&#x27; pro-Remain vote.

Godsiff supported Owen Smith in the latter&#x27;s failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

During the 2017 election campaign, his local campaign leaflet went viral in the UK due to its slogan &quot;unwanted, unnecessary, opportunistic&quot;, which was supposed to be about the snap election called by Theresa May, but appeared, due to the format, to be referring to Godsiff himself. At the election he gained 42,143 votes (77.6%), giving him a majority of 33,944 (62.5%), which was the twelfth largest majority of any UK MP by percentage of constituency vote.

In May 2019, in the wake of protests in Birmingham over LGBT-inclusive education in primary schools, Godsiff sided with the protestors: &quot;I have concerns about the age appropriateness of children of four and five being introduced to these ideas&quot;, he said, later admitting that he had not read the books. Anderton Park Primary School in Sparkhill, which has been at the centre of the row, is in Godsiff&#x27;s former constituency. He defended his voting record on equality legislation, stating, &quot;I am supportive of the LGBT community. I have consistently voted for all laws pertaining to equality and to defend the rights of everyone to live the lifestyle they choose.&quot;

In October 2019, Labour Party members in all four branches of his Hall Green constituency opted to trigger a re-selection process to choose the Labour candidate at the next general election. As a sitting Member of Parliament, Godsiff was automatically entitled to be shortlisted as a potential candidate. Godsiff had indicated that he intended to stand for re-selection. However, the process was paused due to the election being called that month, resulting in the decision being made by the NEC to not endorse Godsiff and select a new candidate with a local panel.

He stood as an Independent at the 2019 general election and came third. He was succeeded in the seat by Tahir Ali.

==Personal life==
Godsiff has been married to Julia Brenda Morris since 1977 and they have a son and a daughter.

He is a lifelong supporter of Charlton Athletic F.C. He was previously the chairman of the Charlton Athletic Community Trust, which oversees the club&#x27;s community work. He resigned from this position on 26 June 2019 following the controversy surrounding his support for the anti-LGBT protesters in Birmingham.

<doc id="426699" wikidata="Q917917" url="?curid=426699" title="Bristol Cathedral">
<text>Bristol Cathedral, formally the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, is a Church of England cathedral in the city of Bristol, England. It is the seat of the Bishop of Bristol. The cathedral was originally an abbey dedicated to St Augustine, founded in 1140 and consecrated in 1148. It became the cathedral of the new diocese of Bristol in 1542, after the dissolution of the monasteries. It is a Grade I listed building.

The earliest surviving fabric is the late 12th century chapter house, which contains some of the first uses of pointed arches in England. The eastern end of the church is medieval, the oldest part being the early 13th century Elder Lady Chapel. The remainder of the east end was rebuilt in the English Decorated Gothic style during the 14th century as a hall church, with aisles the same height as the central choir. In the 15th century the transepts were rebuilt and the central tower added. The nave was incomplete when the abbey was dissolved in 1539 and demolished; a Gothic Revival replacement was constructed in the 19th century by George Edmund Street, partially to the original plans. The western towers, designed by John Loughborough Pearson, were completed in 1888.

In addition to the cathedral&#x27;s architectural features, it contains several memorials and an historic organ. Little of the original stained glass remains, with some being replaced in the Victorian era and further losses during the Bristol Blitz.

==History==
===Foundation and 12th century===
Bristol Cathedral was founded as St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in 1140 by Robert Fitzharding, a wealthy local landowner and royal official who later became Lord Berkeley. As the name suggests, the monastic precinct housed Augustinian canons. The original abbey church, of which only fragments remain, was constructed between 1140 and 1148 in the Romanesque style, known in England as Norman. The Venerable Bede made reference to St Augustine of Canterbury visiting the site in 603ACE, and John Leland had recorded that it was a long-established religious shrine. William Worcester recorded in his Survey of Bristol that the original Augustinian abbey church was further to the east of the current site, though that was rebuilt as the church of St Augustine the Less. That site was bombed during World War II and the site built on by the Royal Hotel, but archaeological finds were deposited with Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The dedication ceremony was held on 11 April 1148, and was conducted by the Bishops of Worcester, Exeter, Llandaff, and St Asaph.

Further stone buildings were erected on the site between 1148 and 1164. Three examples of this phase survive, the chapterhouse and the abbey gatehouse, now the diocesan office, together with a second Romanesque gateway, which originally led into the abbot&#x27;s quarters. T.H.B. Burrough, a local architectural historian, describes the former as &quot;the finest Norman chapter house still standing today&quot;. In 1154 King Henry II greatly increased the endowment and wealth of the abbey as reward to Robert Fitzharding, for his support during The Anarchy which brought Henry II to the throne. By 1170 enough of the new church building was complete for it to be dedicated by four bishops – Worcester, Exeter, Llandaff and St Asaph.

===13th century===
Under Abbot David (1216–1234) there was a new phase of building, notably the construction in around 1220 of a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, abutting the northern side of the choir. This building, which still stands, was to become known as the Elder Lady Chapel. The architect, referred to in a letter as &#x27;L&#x27;, is thought to have been Adam Lock, master mason of Wells Cathedral. The stonework of the eastern window of this chapel is by William the Geometer, of about 1280. Abbot David argued with the convent and was deposed in 1234 to be replaced by William of Bradstone who purchased land from the mayor to build a quay and the Church of St Augustine the Less. The next abbot was William Longe, the Chamberlain of Keynsham, whose reign was found to have lacked discipline and had poor financial management. In 1280 he resigned and was replaced as abbot by Abbot Hugh who restored good order, with money being given by Edward I.

===14th–16th century===
Under Abbot Edward Knowle (1306–1332), a major rebuilding of the Abbey church began despite financial problems. Between 1298 and 1332 the eastern part of the abbey church was rebuilt in the English Decorated Gothic style. He also rebuilt the cloisters, the canons&#x27; dining room, the King&#x27;s Hall and the King&#x27;s Chamber. The Black Death is likely to have affected the monastery and when William Coke became abbot in 1353 he obtained a papal bull from Pope Urban V to allow him to ordain priests at a younger age to replace those who had died. Soon after the election of his successor, Henry Shellingford, in 1365 Edward III took control of the monastery and made The 4th Baron Berkeley its commissioner to resolve the financial problems. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries Abbot Cernay and Abbot Daubeney restored the fortunes of the order, partly by obtaining the perpetual vicarage of several local parishes. These difficulties meant that little building work had been undertaken for nearly 100 years. However, in the mid-15th century, the number of Canons increased and the transept and central tower were constructed. Abbot John Newland, (1481–1515), also known as &#x27;Nailheart&#x27; due to his rebus of a heart pierced by three nails, began the rebuilding of the nave, but it was incomplete at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Newland also rebuilt the cloisters, the upper part of the Gatehouse, the canons&#x27; dormitory and dining room, and the Prior&#x27;s Lodging (parts of which remained until 1884 as they were built into Minster House).

The partly built nave was demolished and the remaining eastern part of the church closed until it reopened as a cathedral under the secular clergy. In an edict dated June 1542, Henry VIII and Thomas Cranmer raised the building to rank of Cathedral of a new Diocese of Bristol. The new diocese was created from parts of the Diocese of Gloucester and the Diocese of Bath and Wells; Bristol had been, before the Reformation, and the erection of Gloucester diocese, part of the Diocese of Worcester. Paul Bush, (died 1558) a former royal household chaplain, was created the first Bishop of Bristol. The new cathedral was dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity.

===19th century===
In the 1831 Bristol Riots, a mob broke into the Chapter House, destroying a lot of the early records of the Abbey and damaging the building. The church itself was protected from the rioters by William Phillips, sub-sacrist, who barred their entry to the church at the cloister door.

Between the merger of the old Bristol diocese back into the Gloucester diocese on 5 October 1836 and the re-erection of the new independent Bristol diocese on 9 July 1897, Bristol Cathedral was a joint and equal cathedral of the Diocese of Gloucester and Bristol.

George Gilbert Scott was consulted in 1860 and suggested removing the screen dated 1542 to provide &#x27;a nave of the grandest possible capacity&#x27;. The work at this time also removed some of the more vulgar medieval misericords in the choir stalls. With the 19th century&#x27;s Gothic Revival signalling renewed interest in Britain&#x27;s ancient architectural heritage, a new nave, in a similar style to the eastern end, based on original 15th-century designs, was added between 1868 and 1877 by George Edmund Street, clearing the houses which had been built, crowded onto the site of the former nave, including Minster House. In 1829 leases for these houses were refused by the Dean and Chapter because the houses had become &#x27;very notoriously a receptacle for prostitutes&#x27;. The rebuilding of the nave was paid for by public subscription including benefactors such as Greville Smyth of Ashton Court, The Miles family of Kings Weston House, the Society of Merchant Venturers, Stuckey&#x27;s Bank, William Gibbs of Tyntesfield, and many other Bristol citizens. The opening ceremony was on 23 October 1877. However, the west front with its twin towers, designed by John Loughborough Pearson, was only completed in 1888. The niches around the north porch originally held statues of St Gregory, St Ambrose, St Jerome and St Augustine, but their frivolous detail invoked letters of protest to their &quot;Catholic&quot; design. When the Dean, Gilbert Elliot, heard of the controversy, he employed a team of workmen without the knowledge of the architect or committee to remove the statues. The next edition of the Bristol Times reported that &#x27;a more rough and open exhibition of iconoclasm has not been seen in Bristol since the days of Oliver Cromwell.&#x27; The sculptor, James Redfern, was made the scapegoat by the architect and the church; he retreated from the project, fell ill, and died later that year. As a result of Elliot&#x27;s actions, the committee resigned &quot;en masse&quot; and the completion of the works was taken over by the Dean and Chapter. Elliot&#x27;s drop in popularity meant that raising funds was a harder and slower process and the nave had to be officially opened before the two west towers were built.

Several of the bells in the north-west tower were cast in 1887 by John Taylor &amp; Co. However, earlier bells include those from the 18th century by the Bilbie family and one by William III &amp; Richard II Purdue made in 1658.

===20th century===
The full peal of eight bells was installed in the north-west tower, taken from the ruins of Temple Church after the bombing of World War II. In 1994, the ceremony took place in Bristol Cathedral for the first 32 women to be ordained as Church of England priests. Since the early 2000s, the cathedral&#x27;s associations with the legacy of philanthropist and enslaver Edward Colston have been the subject of public debate, resulting in changes to annual commemoration services and memorials inside the cathedral.

==Architecture==


Bristol Cathedral is a grade I listed building which shows a range of architectural styles and periods. Tim Tatton-Brown writes of the 14th century eastern arm as &quot;one of the most interesting and splendid structures in this country&quot;.

===Specifications===
Most of the medieval stonework, is made from limestone taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas. The two-bay Elder Lady Chapel, which includes some Purbeck Marble, lies to the north of the five-bay aisled chancel or presbytery. The Eastern Lady Chapel has two bays, the sacristy one-bay and the Berkeley Chapel two bays. The exterior has deep buttresses with finials to weathered tops and crenellated parapets with crocketed pinnacles below the Perpendicular crossing tower.

The west front has two large flanking three-stage towers. On the rear outer corners of the towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers is a deep entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to the arch. The tympanum of the arch contains an empty niche.

===Hall Church===
The eastern end of Bristol Cathedral is highly unusual for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was conceived as a hall church, meaning that the aisles are the same height as the choir. While a feature of German Gothic architecture, this is rare in Britain, and Bristol cathedral is the most significant example. In the 19th century, G. E. Street designed the nave along the same lines. The effect of this elevation means that there are no clerestory windows to light the central space, as is usual in English Medieval churches. The north and south aisles employ a unique manner where the vaults rest on tie beam style bridges supported by pointed arches. All the internal light must come from the aisle windows which are accordingly very large. In the choir, the very large window of the Lady chapel is made to fill the entire upper part of the wall, so that it bathes the vault in daylight, particularly in the morning.
Because of the lack of a clerestory, the vault is comparatively low, being only about half the height of that at Westminster Abbey. The interior of the cathedral appears wide and spacious. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner wrote of the early 14th-century choir of Bristol that &quot;from the point of view of spatial imagination&quot; it is not only superior to anything else in England or Europe but &quot;proves incontrovertibly that English design surpasses that of all other countries&quot; at that date.

The choir has broad arches with two wave mouldings carried down the piers which support the ribs of the vaulting. These may have been designed by Thomas Witney or William Joy as they are similar to the work at Wells Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe. The choir is separated from the eastern Lady Chapel by a 14th-century reredos which was damaged in The reformation and repaired in 1839 when the 17th-century altarpiece was removed. The Lady Chapel was brightly painted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries following existing fragments of colour. To the south east of the choir and Lady Chapel is the Berkeley Chapel and an adjoining antechapel or sacristy, which may have been added in the 14th century, possibly replacing an earlier structure. The lady chapel was lightly restored by Stuart Coleman 1877 who was working in the city at that time. His diary describes taking a &#x27;light Conservative approach&#x27; (Coleman Family archive 1988).

====Vaulting====

Another feature of Bristol Cathedral is the vaulting of its various medieval spaces. The work that was carried out under Abbot Knowle is unique in this regard, with not one, but three unique vaults.

In vaulting a roof space using stone ribs and panels of infill, the bearing ribs all spring from columns along the walls. There is commonly a rib called the ridge rib which runs along the apex of the vault. There may be intermediate or tierceron ribs, which have their origin at the columns. In Decorated Gothic there are occasionally short lierne ribs connecting the bearing and tierceron ribs at angles, forming stellar patterns. This is the feature that appears at Bristol, at a very early date, and quite unlike the way that lierne ribs are used elsewhere. In this case, there is no ridge rib, and the lierne ribs are arranged to enclose a series of panels that extend the whole way along the centre of the choir roof, interacting with the large east window by reflecting the light from the smoothly arching surfaces. From the nave can be seen the intricate tracery of the east window echoed in the rich lierne pattern of the tower vault, which is scarcely higher than the choir, and therefore clearly visible. The two aisles of the choir both also have vaults of unique character, with open transverse arches and ribs above the stone bridges.

===Eastern Lady Chapel===

The 13th-century East Lady Chapel is built of red sandstone in an Early English style, making it stand out from the rest of the building. It is four bays long and has a vaulted ceiling. The windows are supported by Blue Lias shafts matching those between the bays. Much of the chapel, including the piscina and sedilia, is decorated with stylised foliage, in a style known as &#x27;stiff-leaf&#x27;.

===Nave===
 Street&#x27;s design followed the form of the Gothic choir. On a plan or elevation it is not apparent that the work is of a different era. But Street designed an interior that respected the delicate proportions of the ribs and mouldings of the earlier work, but did not imitate their patterns. Street&#x27;s nave is vaulted with a conservative vault with tierceron ribs, rising at the same pitch as the choir. Street&#x27;s aisle vaults again echo their counterparts in the mediaeval chancel, using open vaulting above the stone bridges, but the transverse vaults are constructed differently.

====Fittings====

The cathedral has two unusual and often-reproduced monuments, the Berkeley memorials. These are set into niches in the wall, and each is surrounded by a canopy of inverted cusped arches. Pearson&#x27;s screen, completed in 1905, echoes these memorials in its three wide arches with flamboyant cusps.

===West front===
Unlike many English Gothic cathedrals, Bristol&#x27;s west facade has a rose window above the central doorway. The details, however, are clearly English, owing much to the Early English Gothic at Wells Cathedral and the Decorated Gothic at York Minster with a French Rayonnant style.

===Chapter House===

The late Norman chapter house, situated south of the transept, contains some of the first uses of pointed arches in England. It also has a rich sculptural decoration, with a variety of Romanesque abstract motifs. In both of these aspects there are close similarities with the abbey gatehouse, supporting the view that the two structures were built around the same time in the 12th century, as put forward by Street in the 19th century.

The approach to the chapter house is through a rib-vaulted ante-room 3 bays wide, whose pointed arches provide a solution to that room&#x27;s rectangular shape. Carved pointed arches also appear in the decoration of the chapter house itself. Here they arise from the intersections of the interlaced semicircular arcading, which runs continuously around the walls. The chapter house has a quadripartite ribbed vault high. The ribs, walls and columns display a complex interplay of carved patterns: chevron, spiral, nailhead, lozenge and zigzag.

The chapter house has 40 sedilia lining its walls, and may have originally provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1 m (3 ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, and at that time or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the floor was lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong evidence that there was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.

===Stained glass===

The east window in the Lady Chapel was largely replaced and restored in the mid 19th century. However, it does contain some 14th-century stained glass pieces, including male heads and heraldic symbols. Some of the early glass is also incorporated into the Tree of Jesse which goes across nine lights.

During the restoration led by Street, most of the work on the glass was by Hardman &amp; Co.; these include the rose window and towers at the west end and the Magnificat in the Elder Lady Chapel.

Some of the most recent stained glass is by Bristolian Arnold Wathen Robinson following damage during the Bristol Blitz of 1940 and 1941. These included depictions of local Civil Defence during World War II including St. John Ambulance, the British Red Cross and the fire services along with air raid wardens, police officers, the Home Guard and the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service. The most recent glass is an abstract expressionist interpretation of the Holy Spirit designed by Keith New in 1965 and installed in the south choir.

A Victorian era window under the cathedral&#x27;s clock, marked &quot;to the glory of God and in memory of Edward Colston&quot; and commemorating that 17th-century Royal African Company magnate and Bristol philanthropist, was ordered to be covered in June 2020 in advance of its eventual removal. The Diocese of Bristol also decided to remove from the cathedral other dedications to Colston after the toppling of the late 19th-century Statue of Edward Colston in the city centre on 7 June 2020, along with the removal of another stained glass window at St Mary Redcliffe. The cathedral dean previously considered removing the memorial window in 2017 but said in a radio broadcast in February it would cost &quot;many, many thousands of pounds&quot;. The legacy of Colston became contentious because of his involvement in, and profit from, the transatlantic slave trade in enslaved Africans, and came to a head after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.

==Decoration, monuments and burials==

The south transept contains the important late Saxon stone panel of the Harrowing of Hell. It dates from before the Norman Conquest and may have been carved around 1050. Following a fire in 1831 it was found being used as a coffin lid under the Chapter House floor.

The high altar stone reredos are by John Loughborough Pearson of 1899. The three rows of choir stalls are mostly from the late 19th century with Flamboyant traceried ends. There are also 28 misericords dating from 1515 to 1526, installed by Robert Elyot, Abbot of St. Augustine&#x27;s, with carvings largely based on Aesop&#x27;s Fables. In the Berkeley chapel is a very rare candelabrum of 1450 from the Temple church in Bristol.

The monuments within the cathedral include recumbent figures and memorials of several abbots and bishops: Abbot Walter Newbery who died in 1473 and Abbot William Hunt (died 1481) are within 14th-century recesses on the north side of the Lady Chapel, while the recumbent effigy of Abbot John Newland (died 1515) is in a similar recess on the southern side. The coffin lid of Abbot David (died 1234) is in the north transept. In the north choir aisle is a chest tomb to Bishop Bush (died 1558) which includes six fluted Ionic columns with an entablature canopy. Also honoured are: Thomas Westfield, Bishop of Bristol (1642–1644), Thomas Howell (Bishop of Bristol) (1644–1645), Gilbert Ironside the elder, Bishop of Bristol (1661–1671), William Bradshaw (bishop), Bishop of Bristol (1724–1732), Joseph Butler, Bishop of Bristol (1738–1750), John Conybeare, Bishop of Bristol (1750–1755) and Robert Gray (bishop of Bristol) (1827–1834), who is buried in graveyard attached to the cathedral. The Berkeley family as early benefactors are represented by Maurice de Berkeley (died 1281), *Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (died 1321), Lord Berkeley (died 1326) and Thomas Berkeley (died 1243) who are depicted in military effigies on the south side of the choir aisle, along with the chest tomb of Maurice Berkeley (died 1368).
In addition there are notable monuments to local dignitaries of the 17th and 18th century. There is a perpendicular reredos showing figures kneeling at a prayer desk flanked by angels to Robert Codrington (died 1618) and his wife. Phillip Freke (died 1729) is commemorated with a marble wall tablet in the north choir aisle. The oval wall tablet to Rowland Searchfield, English academic and Bishop of Bristol (died 1622) is made of slate. The Newton Chapel, which is between the Chapter House and south choir aisle contains a large dresser tomb of Henry Newton (died 1599) and a recumbent effigy of John Newton (died 1661), as well as a dresser tomb dedicated to Charles Vaughan who died in 1630.

Dame Joan Wadham (1533–1603) is buried, with her two husbands Sir Giles Strangways and Sir John Young, in an altar tomb at the entrance to Bristol Cathedral. She was one of the sisters and co-heiresses (through her issue) of Nicholas Wadham (1531–1609) of Merryfield, Ilton Somerset and of Edge, Branscombe Devon, the co-founder with his wife Dorothy Wadham (1534–1618) of Wadham College, Oxford.

Dame Joan is represented in effigy lying beneath the armorials of Wadham and those of both her husbands, Giles Strangways MP (1528–1562) of Melbury Sampford, with her the ancestor of the Earls of Ilchester, and John Young MP (1519–1589) with whom she built the Great House Bristol from 1568, of which only the Red Lodge, now the Red Lodge Museum, Bristol and completed by Dame Joan in 1590 after the death of her husband, remains today.

Queen Elizabeth I stayed with Joan and Sir John Young at The Great House when she visited Bristol in 1574, and the Red Lodge Museum with its Tudor panelled rooms and wood carvings is only a short walk from the cathedral.

The importance of exploration and trade to the city are reflected by a memorial tablet and representation in stained glass of Richard Hakluyt (died 1616) is known for promoting the settlement of North America by the English through his works. He was a prebendary of the cathedral.

More recent monuments from the early 18th century to the 20th century include: Mrs Morgan (died 1767) by John Bacon to the design of James Stuart and a bust by Edward Hodges Baily to Robert Southey a Bristolian poet of the Romantic school, one of the so-called &quot;Lake Poets&quot;, and Poet laureate for 30 years from 1813 to his death in 1843. Baily also created the monument to William Brane Elwyn (died 1841). The obelisk to local actor William Powell (died 1769) was made by James Paine. The memorial to Elizabeth Charlotte Stanhope (died 1816) in the Newton Chapel is by Richard Westmacott. There is a memorial plaque to the education reformer Mary Carpenter (died 1877). The memorial to Emma Crawfuird (died 1823) is by Francis Leggatt Chantrey while the effigy to Francis Pigou (Dean; died 1916) is by Newbury Abbot Trent. The most recent are of the biographer Alfred Ainger (died 1904) and the composer Walford Davies (died 1941).

In 1994 a plaque was installed to mark the first 32 women ordained as priests in the Church of England. In 2022 it was replaced with a new plaque that listed the names of these women, rather than only the names of the men who carried out the ceremony. Both plaques were carved in Welsh slate. The plaque is located on the north side of the nave where it meets the transept.

===Organ===

The organ was originally built in 1685 by Renatus Harris at a cost of £500. This has been removed and repaired many times. However, some of the original work, including the case and pipes, is incorporated into the present instrument, which was built by J. W. Walkers &amp; Sons in 1907, and which is to be found above the stalls on the north side of the choir. It was further restored in 1989. The current restoration of the organ by Harrison &amp; Harrison commenced in January 2024.

Prior to the building of the main organ, the cathedral had a chair organ, which was built by Robert Taunton in 1662, and before that one built by Thomas Dallam in 1630.

===Organists===

The earliest known appointment of an organist of Bristol Cathedral is Thomas Denny in 1542. Notable organists have included the writer and composer Percy Buck. The present Organist is Mark Lee and the Assistant Organist Paul Walton.

===Choirs===
The first choir at Bristol probably dates from the Augustinian foundation of 1140. The present choir consists has twenty-eight choristers, six lay clerks and four choral scholars. The choristers include fourteen boys and fourteen girls, who are educated at Bristol Cathedral Choir School, the first government-funded choir academy in England. Choral evensong is sung daily during term.

The Bristol Cathedral Concert Choir (formerly Bristol Cathedral Special Choir) was formed in 1954 and comprised sixty singers who presented large-scale works such as Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;.; it was wound up in 2016. The Bristol Cathedral Consort is a voluntary choir drawn from young people of the city. They sing Evensong twice a month. Bristol Cathedral Chamber Choir was reformed in 2001 and is directed by assistant organist Paul Walton.

==In popular culture==
Bristol Cathedral was used as a location in the 1978 film &quot;The Medusa Touch&quot; under the guise of a fictional London place of worship called Minster Cathedral. It was also used as a location for BBC TV&#x27;s 2015 production of &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, for the coronation scene.

==Other cathedrals in Bristol==
Bristol is also home to a Roman Catholic cathedral, Clifton Cathedral. The Church of England parish church of St. Mary Redcliffe is so grand as to be occasionally mistaken for a cathedral by visitors.

<text>Open gaming is a movement within the tabletop role-playing game (RPG) industry with superficial similarities to the open source software movement. The key aspect is that copyright holders license their works under public copyright licenses that permit others to make copies or create derivative works of the game.

A number of role-playing game publishers have joined the open gaming movement, largely as a result of the release of the original System Reference Document (SRD) by Wizards of the Coast, which consisted of the core rules of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition. Open gaming has also been popular among small press role-playing game and supplement authors.

== History ==
The use of the term open gaming began with the publication of the original SRD and the simultaneous release of the Open Game License (OGL). However, role-playing games had been licensed under open and free content licenses before this.

=== The Fudge Legal Notice ===
The Fudge role-playing game system was created in 1992 by Steffan O&#x27;Sullivan with extensive help from the rec.games.design community. The name stood for &quot;Freeform Universal Donated Game Engine&quot; until Steffan O&#x27;Sullivan changed &#x27;donated&#x27; to &#x27;DIY&#x27; in 1995.

One reason why Fudge succeeded is that the author released it under the &quot;FUDGE Legal Notice&quot;, a license that removed most restrictions on non-commercial use. However the FUDGE Legal Notice (more commonly known as simply &quot;the Fudge license&quot;) was never intended to cover any work other than its eponymous role-playing game. Derivative works which were to be distributed for a fee required written permission from Fudge&#x27;s author, Steffan O&#x27;Sullivan. The details of the Fudge Legal Notice were modified and expanded from time to time as O&#x27;Sullivan updated his work, but the essential elements of the license remained unchanged. The 1993 FUDGE Legal Notice allowed reprinting of the Fudge rules, including in otherwise commercial works, as long as certain conditions were met. The 1995 FUDGE Legal Notice permitted the creation of derivative works for personal use and for publication in periodicals.

In March 2004, Grey Ghost Games acquired the copyright of Fudge, and on April 6, 2005, they released a version of Fudge under the Open Game License, making it open for commercial use.

=== Dominion Rules and Circe ===

The phrase &quot;opensource roleplaying&quot; was used as early as 1999 by the Dominion Rules role-playing system, the license of which permitted supplementary material to be written for its rules. Another &quot;open&quot; system was the Circe role-playing system, published by the WorldForge project under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). Gods &amp; Monsters, created by Jerry Stratton, was also distributed under GFDL in 2013.

=== Open Game License ===

Despite Fudge and other games, the open gaming movement did not gain widespread recognition within the role-playing game industry until 2000, when Wizards of the Coast (WotC) published portions of the 3rd Edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as the System Reference Document under the Open Game License. This move was driven by Ryan Dancey then Brand Manager for WotC, who drafted the Open Game License and first coined the term &quot;open gaming&quot; with respect to role-playing games.

==== Open Gaming Foundation ====
The Open Gaming Foundation (OGF) was founded by Ryan Dancey as an independent forum for discussion of open gaming among the members of the fledgling open gaming movement. The OGF consisted of a web site and a series of mailing lists, including the &quot;OGF-L&quot; list (for general discussion of open gaming licensing issues) and the &quot;OGF-d20-L&quot; list (for discussion of d20-specific issues).

The most common criticism of the OGF was that it was primarily a venue for publicizing Wizards of the Coast. Ryan Dancey was an employee of WotC, and discussion on the mailing lists tended to focus on d20 and the OGL (both owned by WotC) rather than on open gaming in general.

The OGF maintained a definition of an &quot;open game license&quot; while it was active, with two criteria:

# The license must allow game rules and materials that use game rules to be freely copied, modified and distributed.
# The license must ensure that material distributed using the license cannot have those permissions restricted in the future.

The Foundation explicitly stated that the first condition excludes licences that ban commercial use. The second requirement is intended to ensure that the rights granted by the licence are inalienable.

==== Reaction ====
The OGL gained immediate popularity with commercial role-playing game publishers. However, the OGL was criticized (primarily by independent role-playing game developers) for being insufficiently &quot;open&quot;, and for being controlled by the market leader Wizards of the Coast. In response to this, and in an attempt to shift support away from the OGL and toward more open licenses, several alternatives to the OGL were suggested and drafted. Similarly, the popularity of the OGL inspired others to create their own, specific open content licenses. Virtually none of these gained acceptance beyond the works of the licenses&#x27; own authors, and many have since been abandoned.

=== Open RPG Creative License ===
Linda Codega, for &quot;Io9&quot; in January 2023, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of an update to the OGL including updated terms such as no longer authorizing use of the OGL1.0. Codega highlighted that &quot;if the original license is in fact no longer viable, every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand&quot;. Following this, Paizo announced a new Open RPG Creative License (ORC) as a direct response to the reported changes to the OGL. Additional publishers, such as Kobold Press, Chaosium, Green Ronin, Legendary Games, and Rogue Genius Games, will be part of the ORC development process. The ORC will be an open, perpetual, and irrevocable system-agnostic license with legal development paid for by Paizo &quot;under the legal guidance of Azora Law&quot;, however, the license &quot;will not be owned by Paizo, nor will it be owned by any company who makes money publishing RPGs&quot;. Paizo plans to find a &quot;nonprofit with a history of open source values to own this license&quot; and stated that &quot;Azora Law&#x27;s ownership of the process and stewardship should provide a safe harbor against any company being bought, sold, or changing management in the future and attempting to rescind rights or nullify sections of the license&quot;.

The ORC was released in July 2023.

=== Free League Publishing&#x27;s licenses ===
Free League Publishing announced two licenses, for its Year Zero game system and another for its upcoming fantasy RPG &quot;Dragonbane&quot;.

== Adoption ==
The most common open gaming license in use by commercial role-playing game publishers is the OGL. There are many publishers currently producing material based on the first System Reference Document, and many which make their products available under the OGL but which use game systems not based on the SRD.

Wizards of the Coast used the non-open Game System License for the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but released a new System Reference Document in 2015 for the 5th edition licensed under the OGL.

== Approved licences ==
The Open Gaming Foundation describes these licences as ‘Known Open Gaming Licenses’.

== Retro-clone systems ==

A number of fans and publishers have used existing open game content to create rules systems which closely emulate older editions of games that are no longer supported, and released those rules systems under an open license. The term &quot;retro-clone&quot; was coined by Goblinoid Games, the publisher of Labyrinth Lord.

Notable examples of retro-clone games are &quot;Basic Fantasy RPG&quot; (based on &quot;Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;), &quot;OSRIC&quot; (based on 1st edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;), &quot;Labyrinth Lord&quot; (based on &quot;Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;), and &quot;Swords &amp; Wizardry&quot; (based on original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;).

<doc id="426702" wikidata="Q912407" url="?curid=426702" title="San Quentin Rehabilitation Center">
<text>San Quentin Rehabilitation Center (SQ), formerly known as San Quentin State Prison, is a California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation state prison for men, located north of San Francisco in the unincorporated place of San Quentin in Marin County.

Established in 1852, and opening in 1854, San Quentin is the oldest prison in California. The state&#x27;s only death row for male inmates, the largest in the United States, was located at the prison. Its gas chamber has not been used since 1993, and its lethal injection chamber was last used in 2006. The prison has been featured on film, radio drama, video, podcast, and television; is the subject of many books; has hosted concerts; and has housed many notorious inmates.

== Facilities ==

The correctional complex sits on Point San Quentin, which consists of on the north side of San Francisco Bay. The prison complex itself occupies , valued in a 2001 study at between $129 million and $664 million.

As of July 31, 2022, San Quentin was incarcerating people at 105% of its design capacity, with 3,239 occupants.

=== Death row ===

Men condemned to death in California were, in general, formerly held at San Quentin. Most of the former death row population, with some exceptions, have been moved to general population in other California institutions as of May 28, 2024. These transfers have been arranged to comply with Proposition 66 and are being managed by the Condemned Inmate Transfer Program of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Of the 598 condemned inmates in California as of February 5, 2025, only 9 remained at San Quentin, with the last 9 inmates expected to also be transferred after completing needed medical or psychiatric care. Despite the transfers, the condemned inmates remain under sentence of death at their new institutions.

Condemned women are held at Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla. As of December 2015, San Quentin held almost 700 male inmates in its Condemned Unit, or &quot;death row&quot;. As of 2001, San Quentin&#x27;s death row was described as &quot;the largest in the Western Hemisphere&quot;; as of 2005, it was called &quot;the most populous execution antechamber in the United States.&quot; The states of Florida and Texas had fewer death row inmates in 2008 (397 and 451 respectively) than San Quentin.

The death row at San Quentin was divided into three sections: the quiet &quot;North-Segregation&quot; or &quot;North-Seg&quot;, built in 1934, for prisoners who &quot;don&#x27;t cause trouble&quot;; the &quot;East Block&quot;, a &quot;crumbling, leaky maze of a place built in 1927&quot;; and the &quot;Adjustment Center&quot; for the &quot;worst of the worst&quot;. Most of the prison&#x27;s death row inmates resided in the East Block. The fourth floor of the North Block was the prison&#x27;s first death row facility, but additional death row space opened after executions resumed in the U.S. in 1978. The adjustment center received solid doors, preventing &quot;gunning-down&quot; or attacking persons with bodily waste. it housed 81 death row inmates and four non-death row inmates. A dedicated psychiatric facility serves the prisoners. A converted shower bay in the East Block hosted religious services. Many prison programs available for most inmates were unavailable for death row inmates.

Although $395 million was allocated in the 20082009 state budget for new death row facilities at San Quentin, in December 2008 two legislators introduced bills to eliminate the funding. The state had planned to build a new death row facility, but Governor Jerry Brown canceled those plans in 2011. In 2015 Brown asked the Legislature for funds for a new death row as the current death row facilities were becoming filled. At the time the non-death row prison population was decreasing, opening room for death row inmates. the San Quentin death row had a capacity of 715 prisoners.

=== Executions ===

All executions in California (male and female) take place at San Quentin. The execution chamber is located in a one-story addition close to the East Block. Women executed in California are transported to San Quentin by bus before being executed.

The methods for execution at San Quentin have changed over time. Prior to 1893, the counties executed convicts. Between 1893 and 1937, 215 people were executed at San Quentin by hanging, after which 196 prisoners died in the gas chamber. The gas chamber was constructed by inmates in 1937. In 1995, the use of gas for execution was ruled &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;, which led to executions inside the gas chamber by lethal injection. Between 1996 and 2006, eleven people were executed at San Quentin by lethal injection.

In April 2007, staff of the California Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office discovered that a new execution chamber was being built at San Quentin; legislators subsequently &quot;accuse[d] the governor of hiding the project from the Legislature and the public.&quot; The old lethal injection facility had included an injection room of and a single viewing area; the facility that was being built included an injection chamber of and three viewing areas for family, victim, and press. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stopped construction of the facility the next week. The legislature later approved $180,000 to finish the project, and the facility was completed.

In addition to state executions, three federal executions have been carried out at San Quentin. Samuel Richard Shockley and Miran Edgar Thompson had been incarcerated at Alcatraz Island federal penitentiary and were executed on December 3, 1948, for the murder of two prison guards during the Battle of Alcatraz. Carlos Romero Ochoa had murdered a federal immigration officer after he was caught smuggling illegal immigrants across the border near El Centro, California. He was executed at San Quentin&#x27;s gas chamber on December 10, 1948.

On March 13, 2019, after Governor Gavin Newsom ordered a moratorium on the state&#x27;s death penalty, the state withdrew its current lethal injection protocol, and San Quentin dismantled and indefinitely closed its gas and lethal injection execution chambers.

== Programs ==
*Prison to Employment Connection, A Better Way Out - Prison to Employment Connection is offered to inmates at San Quentin State Prison who are close to their release dates or have a scheduled Parole Board Hearing. After successfully completing a rigorous 14-week employment readiness program, inmates are invited to an Employer Day. Potential employers (PEC Partners) come to the prison to interview inmates, review their resumes, and offer guidance and support for potential employment upon release.
* VVGSQ – Vietnam Veterans Group San Quentin – Although the group had been meeting for some time, the name officially began on April 7, 1987. In 1988 they started the annual Christmas Toy giveaway, giving toys to visiting children. In 1989 they began the annual scholarship fund for high school seniors. They spend their time raising money and since 1987 have given over $80,000 to the community.
* The Last Mile started in 2011 under Chris Redlitz (entrepreneur and venture capital) initiative. The program aims to give resources and mentorship to inmates to help them find their way into tech startup entrepreneurship and reduce the rate of recidivism.
* The San Quentin Drama Workshop began at the prison in 1958 after a performance of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; the previous year.
* The San Quentin SQUIRES (&quot;San Quentin Utilization of Inmate Resources, Experiences, and Studies&quot;) program, which began in 1964, is reported to be the &quot;oldest juvenile awareness program in the United States.&quot; It involves inmates at the prison interacting with troubled youths for the purpose of deterring them from crime, and was the subject of a 1978 documentary film &quot;Squires of San Quentin&quot;. In 1983, a randomized controlled study was published that found that the program produced no overall reduction in delinquency. The program was still functional as of 2008.
* Since the 1920s, San Quentin inmates have been allowed to play baseball. Starting in 1994 inmates have played against players from outside the prison. The games occur twice a week through the summer. Originally the Pirates, the team of prisoners is called the &quot;Giants&quot; in honor of the San Francisco Giants, who donated uniforms to the team. A second team called the Athletics was later started, named after the Oakland Athletics. The team of outside players is called the &quot;Willing&quot;. The umpires and fans are inmates, but the coaches on the field are volunteers. Although some people question the appropriateness of baseball games being held at the prison, officials believe &quot;organized sports is a way to keep inmates occupied and perhaps teach a few lessons on getting along with others.&quot; These games were detailed in a &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; episode on June 20, 2006, and in several other documentaries.
* San Quentin has the only on-site college degree-granting program in California&#x27;s entire prison system, which began in 1996 and which is currently run by the Mount Tamalpais College.
*No More Tears Program, co-founded by incarcerated men at San Quentin. This program is committed to stopping the violence in the community and changing the mindset. This program stays alive through donations, volunteers, and CDCR who come into the prison and become involved in the workshops with the incarcerated men: Changing the mindset, Response to Violence, Employability, Fixin&#x27; da Hood. All inmates and volunteers are working toward achieving the program&#x27;s mission: stopping the tears of loved ones and family by being committed to stopping the youth from committing acts of violence.
* The California Reentry Program at San Quentin, begun in 2003, &quot;helps inmates re-enter society after they serve their sentences.&quot;
* The &quot;San Quentin News&quot; is the only inmate-produced newspaper in California and one of the few in the world.

== History ==

Though numerous towns and localities in the area are named after Roman Catholic saints, and &quot;San Quintín&quot; is Spanish for &quot;Saint Quentin&quot;, the prison was not named after the saint. The land on which it is situated, Point Quentin, is named after a Coast Miwok warrior named Quentín, fighting under Chief Marin, who was taken prisoner at that place.

In 1851, California&#x27;s first prison opened; it was a 268-ton wooden ship named the &quot;Waban&quot;, anchored in San Francisco Bay and outfitted to hold 30 inmates. Some of the &quot;Waban&#x27;s&quot; timber remains a part of the new hospital structure inside the prison. After a series of speculative land transactions and a legislative scandal, inmates who were housed on the&quot; Waban&quot; constructed San Quentin which opened its first cell block, nicknamed &quot;the Stones&quot;, in 1854. Before being retired altogether, this initial unit would come to be used as a dungeon after newer additions were constructed atop it. The Stones, however, survive to this day and is thought to be California&#x27;s oldest surviving public work.

Clinton Duffy was the warden from 1940 to 1952. He had fresh insights informing the reorganization of the prison structure and reformation of prison management. Prior to Duffy, San Quentin had gone through years of violence, inhumane punishments and civil rights abuses against prisoners. The previous warden was forced to resign. Duffy had the offending prison guards fired and added a librarian, psychiatrists, and several surgeons at San Quentin. Duffy&#x27;s press agent publicized sweeping reforms. San Quentin remained a brutal prison where prisoners continued to be beaten to death. The use of torture as an approved method of interrogation at San Quentin was banned in 1944.

In 1941, the first prison meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous took place at San Quentin; in commemoration of this, the 25-millionth copy of the AA Big Book was presented to Jill Brown, of San Quentin, at the International Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In 1947, Warden Duffy recruited Herman Spector to work as assistant warden at San Quentin. Spector turned down the invitation to be assistant warden and chose instead to become senior librarian if he could institute his theories on reading as a program to encourage pro-social behavior. By 1955, Spector was being interviewed in library journals and suggesting the prison library could contribute significantly to rehabilitation.

The dining hall of the prison is adorned by six sepia-toned murals depicting California history. They were painted by Alfredo Santos, one-time convicted heroin dealer and successful artist, during his 1953–1955 incarceration. The murals were painted with a thinned, raw sienna oil paint directly to plaster as he was denied use of other colors to paint with.

Between 1992 and 1997, a &quot;boot camp&quot; was held at the prison that was intended to &quot;rehabilitat[e] first-time, nonviolent offenders&quot;; the program was discontinued because it did not reduce recidivism or save money.

A 2005 court-ordered report found that the prison was &quot;old, antiquated, dirty, poorly staffed, poorly maintained with inadequate medical space and equipment and overcrowded.&quot; Later that year, the warden was fired for &quot;threaten[ing] disciplinary action against a doctor who spoke with attorneys about problems with health care delivery at the prison.&quot; By 2007, a new trauma center had opened at the prison and a new $175 million medical complex was planned.

In 2020, the prison became the center of a COVID-19 outbreak, after a group of prisoners were transferred to San Quentin from the California Institution for Men in Chino, California. Initial reports suggested that San Quentin officials were told that the new inmates had all tested negative; however, few had been tested at all. By June 22, at least 350 inmates and staff had tested positive, in what a federal judge called a &quot;significant failure&quot; of policy.

In March 2023, California governor Gavin Newsom announced a &quot;historic transformation&quot; of the then-called San Quentin State Prison as part of a project to improve public safety through a greater focus on rehabilitation and education. As part of the project, the prison was renamed San Quentin Rehabilitation Center and an advisory group of rehabilitation and public safety experts was formed to advise the efforts.

=== Former ===
*Jeffrey Aguilar: (born 1985) was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Oxnard business owner, Gurmohinder Singh. On a Saturday morning in August 2008, Singh, known for his check cashing and mini mart businesses, was robbed and fatally shot outside the US Bank on Oxnard Blvd. At the time of the incident, Singh was carrying $100,000 in cash.

=== Fiction, literature and publications ===
Gang-pulp author Margie Harris wrote a story on San Quentin for the short-lived pulp magazine &quot;Prison Stories&quot;. The story, titled &quot;Big House Boomerang&quot;, appeared in the March 1931 issue. It used San Quentin&#x27;s brutal jute mill as its setting. Harris&#x27; knowledge of the prison came from her days as a newspaper reporter in the Bay Area, and her acquaintance with famous San Quentin prisoner Ed Morrell.

The 1915 novel &quot;The Star Rover&quot; by Jack London was based in San Quentin. A framing story is told in the first person by Darrell Standing, a university professor serving life imprisonment in San Quentin State Prison for murder. Prison officials try to break his spirit by means of a torture device called &quot;the jacket&quot;, a canvas jacket which can be tightly laced so as to compress the whole body, inducing angina. Standing discovers how to withstand the torture by entering a kind of trance state, in which he walks among the stars and experiences portions of past lives.

=== Podcasts ===

<doc id="426705" wikidata="Q5292247" url="?curid=426705" title="Don Bolles">
<text>Donald Fifield Bolles (July 10, 1928 – June 13, 1976) was an American investigative reporter for &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; newspaper who was known for his coverage of organized crime in and around Phoenix, Arizona, especially by the Chicago Outfit. His murder in a car bombing was suspected to be mob-related but was later found to be connected to his reporting on real estate fraud by local contractors.

==Biography==
Don Bolles was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 10, 1928. At a young age he moved to New Jersey, where his father was chief of the state&#x27;s Associated Press (AP) bureau; his paternal grandfather, Stephen Bolles, had also been in the newspaper business. Don was also the brother of clergyman and author Richard Nelson Bolles and the first cousin of humanist theoretician Edmund Blair Bolles.

Bolles graduated Teaneck High School in 1946, then obtained a degree in government from Beloit College, where he was editor of the campus newspaper &quot;The Round Table&quot; and received a President&#x27;s Award for personal achievement. After serving in the Korean War, Bolles joined the AP as a sports editor and rewriter in New Jersey, New York and Kentucky.

In 1962, Bolles was hired by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; newspaper in Phoenix, Arizona, published at the time by Eugene C. Pulliam, where he quickly found a spot on the investigative beat and gained a reputation for dogged reporting of influence peddling, bribery and real estate fraud. Former colleagues say he seemed to grow disillusioned about his job in late 1975 and early 1976, and that he had requested to be taken off the investigative beat, moving to coverage of Phoenix City Hall and then the state legislature.

Bolles was married twice and had a total of seven children.

==Death==
On June 2, 1976, Bolles left a short note in his office typewriter explaining he would meet with an informant, John Adamson, then go to a luncheon meeting at the Hotel Clarendon (now the Clarendon Hotel) and would return by 1:30 p.m. Adamson had promised to divulge information on a land deal involving top state politicians and possibly the Mafia. Bolles spent several minutes waiting in the lobby of the hotel before being summoned by a call to the front desk, where the conversation with Adamson lasted no more than two minutes. Bolles then exited the hotel, having parked his car, a 1976 Datsun 710, in an adjacent lot on Fourth Avenue.

Just as Bolles was driving out of his parking space, a remote-controlled bomb consisting of six sticks of dynamite, taped to the underside of the car beneath the driver&#x27;s seat, was detonated. The explosion shattered Bolles&#x27; lower body, opened the driver&#x27;s door and left him laying half outside the vehicle, mortally wounded. Bolles was treated at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital over the next ten days, during which one of his arms and both of his legs were amputated; he succumbed to his injuries on the eleventh day, June 13, at age 47.

Bolles&#x27; remains were interred in a crypt located in the Serenity Mausoleum of the Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix.

=== Aftermath ===
Despite Bolles making statements implicating the Mafia following the bombing, &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; reported on October 20 that Maricopa County District Attorney Donald Harris &quot;said a conspiracy by &#x27;the country club set&#x27; was more likely than Mafia involvement... The mob doesn&#x27;t kill cops and reporters. This is not a Mafia case.&quot; Bolles identified Adamson by photograph while hospitalized, and Adamson&#x27;s former lawyer Mickey Clifton informed the police of his involvement in the bombing. According to trial testimony, Adamson purchased the electronics for two bombs while visiting San Diego, California, some of which was later found in his apartment. Adamson also allegedly visited &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; employees&#x27; parking area on the day of the bombing and asked a guard which car belonged to Bolles.

The incident sparked an investigation by Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), resulting in a book titled &quot;The Arizona Project&quot;, with Robert W. Greene assuming the head and drawing nearly forty reporters and editors from twenty-three newspapers from across the country.

Adamson pleaded guilty in 1977 to second-degree murder for building and planting the bomb that killed Bolles. Adamson accused Phoenix contractor Max Dunlap, an associate of rancher and liquor wholesaler Kemper Marley, of ordering the hit and Chandler plumber James Robison of triggering the bomb. Phoenix police said they could find no evidence linking Marley with the crime. Adamson testified against Dunlap and Robison, who were convicted of first-degree murder later in 1977 but whose convictions were overturned the following year. When Adamson refused to testify again, he was convicted of first-degree murder in 1980 and sentenced to death, which was overturned by the Arizona Supreme Court. Robison was re-tried and acquitted in 1993, but pleaded guilty to a charge of soliciting an act of criminal violence against Adamson. Robison died in 2013. In 1990, Dunlap was re-charged when Adamson agreed to testify again, and was found guilty of first-degree murder. Dunlap died in an Arizona prison on July 21, 2009.

Adamson was given a reduced sentence because of his cooperation and was released from prison in 1996. He remained in the federal witness protection program (in which he had been placed in 1990 while he was still in prison) and died in an undisclosed location on May 22, 2002 at the age of 58.
Among the last words that Bolles uttered was &quot;Emprise&quot;. Emprise (later called Sportservice and now called Delaware North) was a privately owned company that operated various dog- and horseracing tracks, and is a major food vendor for sports arenas. In 1972, the House Select Committee on Crime held hearings concerning Emprise&#x27;s connections with organized crime figures. Around this time, Emprise and six individuals were convicted of concealing ownership of the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. As a result of the conviction, Emprise&#x27;s dog racing operations in Arizona were placed under the legal authority of a trustee appointed by the Arizona State Racing Commission. Bolles was investigating Emprise at the time of his death. However, no connection between Emprise and his death was discovered.

== Documentary ==
The 2022 documentary &quot;Who Killed Don Bolles?&quot; details the involvement of veteran journalist Don Devereux in the investigative reporting in the aftermath of Bolles&#x27; death. Bradley Funk, an heir to the Emprise fortune and whose ex-wife had dealings with Bolles, was said by Devereux to have ordered the hit. Neal Roberts, an allegedly corrupt Phoenix attorney who was a close friend of Funk, was said to have contacted Adamson for help in the murder, who subsequently recruited known hitman Carl Verive. Neither Funk nor Roberts was ever indicted in the murder of Bolles, and Roberts was controversially granted immunity as an accessory after the fact.

Devereux also claims that he discovered evidence of state corruption in the killing of Bolles, with attorney general Bruce Babbitt having sought to take over the legal investigation due to his gambling debts and subsequent involvement with the Mafia. As a result, exculpatory evidence that would have cleared Dunlap and Robison was allegedly withheld, so as to assure their conviction and avoid undesirable attention on Emprise, the mafia, and Babbitt&#x27;s own indiscretions. Babbitt also negotiated the favorable plea deal for Adamson, who also was said to have avoided fingering the mafia, resulting in flimsy testimony that nevertheless went largely unquestioned by Babbitt&#x27;s office. After campaigning on forcing Emprise out of Arizona, Babbitt later reneged and played a major role in their ability to continue operations in the state.

Devereux also alleged that Bolles&#x27; travails at the &quot;Republic&quot; involved conflicts with the paper&#x27;s upper management, who are known to have confiscated Bolles&#x27; reporting files immediately after his murder. His notes related to the mafia and its connections to state officials and corruption were allegedly destroyed. Bolles&#x27; editor at the paper, Tom Sanford, said to be his only ally therein, followed up on Bolles&#x27; murder despite being forbidden by his superiors to work (or even speak) with the IRE team investigating the mob and Emprise; the resulting IRE series was not published in the &quot;Republic.&quot; Sanford spoke with Roberts as part of his own investigation of the murder and thereafter made plans to speak with Bolles&#x27; second wife to reveal his findings. Just hours after that phone call, Sanford was found dead in a field of a shotgun wound and his demise was ruled a suicide. The shotgun had no fingerprints and, despite a bottle of whiskey being found in his car, his blood showed no signs of alcohol consumption.

==Tributes==
The Newseum was a $400 million interactive museum of news and journalism located in Washington, D.C. and featured Bolles&#x27; 1976 Datsun 710, which had previously sat for 28 years in the Arizona Department of Public Safety&#x27;s impound lot, as the centerpiece of a gallery devoted to both Bolles and fellow slain journalist Chauncey Bailey. However, the Newseum closed in 2019.

==Arizona Project==
In response to Bolles&#x27; death, the Investigative Reporters and Editors board decided to continue Bolles&#x27; work in exposing corruption and organized crime in Arizona. Led by Newsday journalist Robert W. Greene, the Arizona Project team consisted of 38 journalists from 28 newspapers and television stations. They produced a 23-part series in 1977 exposing widespread corruption in the state.

On the 40th anniversary of the Arizona Project, the Don Bolles Award was established. The first recipient was Miroslava Breach Velducea.

<text>The London Residuary Body was a body set up on 12 August 1985 to dispose of the assets of the Greater London Council (GLC) after the council&#x27;s abolition in 1986. 

==Governance==
The LRB was chaired throughout its existence by Sir Godfrey Taylor. In 1986 Tony Banks had two adjournment debates on the LRB, which he said &quot;exists in a vain attempt to clear up the appalling mess left in London following the Government&#x27;s ill-conceived, ill-considered and ill-finished abolition of the Greater London council&quot;, and called &quot;an unelected, unaccountable body whose members were hand-picked by the Government&quot;.

==Work==
Among the GLC assets disposed of by the LRB was County Hall and Parliament Hill Lido. 

After the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority, the LRB took control of its assets. 

After all of the assets were sold, the LRB was wound up in 1996.

The LRB left few traces: the most prominent being a sign with details for the car park close to the Royal Festival Hall and London Eye – which vanished in 2004 when the car park was built. Another is a sign on County Hall itself relating to the legal position of the walkway on the river front of County Hall signed by John Howes, Director of Administration of the LRB.

<text>Alliant Computer Systems Corporation was a computer company that designed and manufactured parallel computing systems. Together with Pyramid Technology and Sequent Computer Systems, Alliant&#x27;s machines pioneered the symmetric multiprocessing market. One of the more successful companies in the group, over 650 Alliant systems were produced over their lifetime. The company was hit by a series of financial problems and went bankrupt in 1992.

==History==

===1980s===
Alliant was founded, as Dataflow Systems, in May 1982 by Ron Gruner, Craig Mundie and Rich McAndrew to produce machines for scientific and engineering users who needed smaller, less costly machines than offerings from Cray Computer and similar high-end vendors. Machines that addressed this market segment later became known as minisupercomputers. At the time there was a huge gap on the price/performance curve as a highly configured VAX 11/780 had a performance of about a MIP and MegaFLOP for around $1M USD and a Cray-1S or Cray 1M over $10M USD.

Alliant&#x27;s first machines were announced in 1985, starting with the FX series. The FX series consisted of four types of 18&quot; x 18&quot; boards: Computational Elements, or CEs, System Cache, Interactive Processor (IP) Cache, and Memory Modules. Each board plugged into a backplane using a special high-density connector. The caches and memory modules all communicated with each other over a 2 x 64-bit bus called the DMB (Dataflow Memory Bus). The backplane was an active backplane and it contained an 8 x 4 crossbar switch (FX/8) that allowed any CE to connect to one of four cache ports, two on each System Cache. Total cache bandwidth was 376 MB/s.

The CEs included a set of Weitek 1064/1065 FPU&#x27;s and several custom designed support chips to implement a custom vector processor. The scalar instruction set was based upon the popular Motorola 68000 architecture. The floating point instruction set, vector instruction set, and concurrency instruction set were all custom co-processor instruction sets designed by Alliant. The shared system cache and a special concurrency bus implemented low latency concurrency control that could be exploited automatically by high-level language compilers to provide data-parallel processing among the CEs. The scalar instruction cycle time for the original CE was 170 ns, the vector processor was twice as fast as the scalar processor with a cycle time of 85 ns.

Each IP Cache had three ports that connected via ribbon cables to Interactive Processors, IPs, which used Motorola 68012&#x27;s and, subsequently Motorola 68020&#x27;s and then Motorola 68030&#x27;s with 4 MB of local RAM in a Multibus form factor plugged into a 13 slot Multibus chassis.

Memory modules were 8 MB each and four way interleaved with ECC. Read bandwidth was 188 MB/s.

Like many early multiprocessing systems, the FX series ran a version of 4.2 BSD Unix on the IPs and CEs, known as Concentrix which initially added multiprocessor support and new VM and IO sub-systems. Subsequent releases added features such as the first striped Track File System (TFS) and support for real time scheduling (FX/RT).

Systems were numerated for the largest potential number of CEs inside, the FX/1, FX/4 and FX/8. Alliant machines were fairly small, the FX/1 was about the size of a large full-height PC, while the FX/8 was smaller than a VAX-11/780, about the size of a large photocopier. All the systems were air-cooled. The speed of an FX/1 was about 2.5 MIPS (million instructions per second) and compared favorably to the 1 MIPS VAX-11/780. A fully populated eight CE FX/8, with eight times the aggregate MIPS, was in practice around five times faster than the FX/1 at solving problems that allowed a high degree of parallel computation (see Amdahl&#x27;s law).

A second series of FX machines, introduced in early 1988, replaced the CE with pin compatible new custom hardware known as the &quot;Advanced Computational Element&quot; (ACE). The Weitek FPUs were replaced by a floating point chipset made by Bipolar Integrated Technology which formed the core of a redesigned vector processor with 32 64-bit vector elements, 8 64-bit scalar floating point registers, 8 32-bit integer registers, and 8 32-bit address registers. The new vector processor increased vector processing speed by reducing the in-register cycle time to 42 ns. The scalar instruction cycle time, cache and memory bandwidth remained the same. The ACE, with its higher level of integration using more advanced ASICs, also required less printed circuit board space allowing it to return to the 18x18 inch square profile used by the other system boards in the main chassis. These were used in the FX/40, FX/80 and VFX machines. In addition, because of the pin compatibility, existing FX/4 and FX/8 systems could be field upgraded to FX/40 and FX/80 configurations by simple replacement of CE&#x27;s with ACE&#x27;s along with an update to the microcode file on the system disk. However systems of mixed configurations of CEs and ACEs were not supported. The smaller FX/1, because of restrictions in chassis cooling, could not be upgraded.

Alliant offered a number of software packages for its machines, including a solver for linear equations (FX/Skyline Solver), a C compiler (FX/C compiler), and scientific libraries (FX/Linpack and FX/Eispack).

===1990s===
In 1990, the FX/2800 series replaced the CE/ACEs and IPs with modules based on the Intel i860 RISC chip. The i860 was an early superscalar CPU that allowed the programmer access directly into the pipelines; with custom coding the 860 was a very fast system, making it perfect for supercomputer applications. In the new series the Super Computational Element (SCE) and Super Interactive Processor (SIP) both consisted of up to four i860s, up to seven of which could be interconnected on the crossbar. A fully expanded FX/2800 could support 28 i860&#x27;s in total.

Also in July 1988 Alliant purchased Raster Technologies, a provider of high-resolution graphics terminals and custom graphics cards for Sun Microsystems workstations. Their GX4000 product was a combination of PHIGS+ software and special graphical boards that could generate and display graphical vectors very fast. For 3D effects, a hardware Z-buffer was available. The Raster graphics technology was integrated with FX/40 and FX/80 machines to produce the VFX, Alliant&#x27;s first fully integrated graphical minisupercomputer.

Alliant&#x27;s final product series was the CAMPUS/800, a massively parallel machine based on units similar to the FX/2800 known as ClusterNodes and sharing a total of up to 4GB of unified memory. Each ClusterNode was connected to up to 32 others with an intra-ClusterNode switch, with a latency of 1 μs and 1.12 GB/s bandwidth. An inter-ClusterNode switch based on HIPPI was also available, with a latency of 30 μs and 2.56 GB/s bandwidth. The largest CAMPUS system created included 192 ClusterNodes in total, and provided 4.7 GFLOPS.

The CAMPUS/800 was first announced in 1991, but the company was hit by a series of financial problems and went bankrupt in 1992. Various Alliant systems soldiered on in service for many years after that however, and were generally considered very reliable.

Alliant also contributed to the development of High Performance Fortran.

The Computer History Museum has examples of the FX/8 and FX/1 (from Convex Computer Corporation after Alliant&#x27;s fall), but is seeking examples of FX/80 and FX/2800 configurations.

<text>The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art at Indiana University is an art museum at Indiana University Bloomington, which opened in 1941 as the Indiana University Museum of Art under the direction of Henry Radford Hope. The museum was intended to be the center of a “cultural crossroads,” an idea brought forth by then-Indiana University President Herman B Wells. The present museum building was designed by I.M. Pei and Partners and dedicated in 1982. The museum&#x27;s collection comprises approximately 45,000 objects, with about 1,400 on display. The collection includes items ranging from ancient jewelry to paintings by Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock. In May 2016, after the announcement of the largest cash gift in the museum&#x27;s history, the museum was renamed the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art in honor of Indianapolis-based philanthropists Sidney and Lois Eskenazi. The museum is located on the Indiana University Bloomington campus at 1133 E. Seventh Street.

==History==
The Eskenazi Museum of Art opened in 1941 in a gallery space in Mitchell Hall under the newly appointed head of the Department of Fine Arts, Henry Radford Hope. The first exhibition, &quot;Sixteen Brown County Painters&quot;, opened on November 21, 1941. The catalog for the event contained a statement describing the goals of the gallery at the time:

&lt;poem&gt;
“The purpose of the Art Center Gallery… is to bring temporary loan exhibitions to the campus so that students may have an opportunity to study and see original works of art. Examples of diverse character will be brought to this gallery in order to show the multiple aspects of art both past and present.”
&lt;/poem&gt;

Establishing a permanent collection did not come to fruition until after World War II. In 1955, art collectors James and Marvelle Adams gave Indiana University a terracotta bust by Aristide Maillol, which inspired Hope to revive the goal to create a permanent collection for an art museum at Indiana University. The William Lowe Bryan Memorial Fund, a fund initiated by James Adams in honor of the university&#x27;s tenth president and in support for the blooming museum, financed almost all of the museum&#x27;s acquisitions in the early years. Hope also contributed to the museum, giving a number of important works including Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;The Studio&quot;. In the formative years of the museum, the late 1950s, 60s, and 70s, gifts to the museum accumulated rapidly.

The museum moved into the gallery space in the newly built Fine Arts building on campus, right next to the auditorium, in 1962. Encouraged by then-University Chancellor Herman B Wells, the Board of Trustees of the university started budgeting a small amount for the museum each year, with additional special allocations for the Art Museum to grow the collection.

In 1968, Hope hired Thomas T. Solley as the museum&#x27;s Assistant Director. Solley became Director in 1971 after Hope retired. Solley, a trained architect, was perfectly suited to start the process of establishing a separate building for the art museum. Wanting an architect with museum-design experience, Solley and the university gave the project to I.M. Pei and Partners in 1974. Completed in 1982, the space had three galleries for permanent collections and one gallery for special exhibitions. Solley grew the collection from 4,000 works to 30,000 in his years at the museum.

Thomas T. Solley resigned in 1986 and Adelheid M. Gealt was appointed director the following year. Gealt served until 2015, and under her leadership the museum was a 2012 recipient of an Andrew J. Mellon Foundation endowment challenge grant, a $500,000 award.

Adelheid Gealt retired from the museum at the end of June 2015, at which point David A. Brenneman became the museum&#x27;s Wilma E. Kelley Director.

In 2016, the museum received a major gift of $15 million from Indianapolis-based philanthropists Sidney and Lois Eskenazi to fund a full renovation of the museum&#x27;s I.M. Pei-designed building. The museum was renamed in their honor in recognition of the gift. In May 2017, the museum closed for renovation. The renovation was completed in 2019, and the museum reopened to the public in November that year.

In late 2023, the museum canceled a planned retrospective exhibition of Palestinian artist Samia Halaby, a 1963 graduate of the university&#x27;s MFA program. A university spokesperson told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in early 2024 that &quot;academic leaders and campus officials canceled the exhibit due to concerns about guaranteeing the integrity of the exhibit for its duration,&quot; but Halaby told the &quot;Times&quot; that before the cancelation the museum&#x27;s director had informed her of staff members&#x27; concerns over her social media posts in support of Palestinian causes and her comparing of the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war to genocide. Several free expression organizations, including PEN America and the National Coalition Against Censorship called on the university and museum to reinstate the exhibition, and Halaby&#x27;s supporters created a petition asking the president of the university to do so. Michigan State University&#x27;s Broad Art Museum said in a statement that they will still host the exhibition in June 2024 as originally planned.

==Collections==
The museum features four permanent collections galleries: the Jane Fortune Gallery, featuring European and American art through the 18th century; the Modern and Contemporary gallery, featuring European and American art from the 19th century on; the Ancient, Asian, and Islamic Art gallery; and the Raymond and Laura Wielgus Gallery of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and Indigenous Art of the Americas. In addition to the permanent collections galleries, the museum has three gallery spaces for rotating exhibitions: the Special Exhibitions gallery; the Time-based Media Gallery, which focuses on film, new media, and similar types of art; and the Rhonda and Anthony Moravec Gallery in the Prints, Drawings, and Photographs Center.

In the museum&#x27;s Ancient, Asian, and Islamic Art gallery, ancient Chinese porcelains, Japanese paintings, classical Greek, Roman, and Etruscan vases, bronzes, and mosaics are on display. The Burton Y. Berry Collection of Ancient Jewelry consists of 5,000 pieces from across the ancient world.

Works by German and Austrian Expressionists August Macke, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Alexej von Jawlensky, Max Beckmann, and Emil Nolde, along with early modern European and American masters such as Fernand Léger, Marcel Duchamp, Georges Braque, and Kurt Schwitters, are in the museum&#x27;s collection. American abstract artists such as Stuart Davis, Frank Stella, and Joseph Cornell are also featured in the museum&#x27;s collection. The works-on-paper collection includes major works by Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Francisco Goya. The photography collection includes the archives of Henry Holmes Smith, Art Sinsabaugh, and Jeffrey A. Wolin.

There are also European Old Master paintings by Niccolo di Buonaccorso, Apollonio di Giovanni, Taddeo Gaddi, Vittore Crivelli, Felipe Vigarny, Gerard Terborch the Elder, Emanuel de Witte, Bernardo Strozzi, and Jean Louis Laneuville, among others. There are also 19th century European paintings by Jean-Léon Gérôme, Charles Daubigny, Gustave Caillebotte (&quot;Yerres, Rain Effect&quot;), and Claude Monet (&quot;Port of Argentieul&quot;) among others.
==Education and programs==
The museum has education programs where schools in 51 of the 90 counties in Indiana participate, allowing a reach of about 7,000 students per year. The museum partners with 55 different university academic departments to provide curriculum-based tours for students at the university. Through partnerships with Indiana University&#x27;s Center for Rural Engagement, programs like a PreK-12 &quot;Look Club&quot; and Creative Arts for Veterans program provide museum programming to rural communities.

Public programs include a student-hosted visiting artist series, where contemporary artists discuss their practices and processes; Art and a Movie, a partnership with the IU Cinema that pairs films with special programming about art, artists, and historical context; docent-led gallery tours; and &quot;Social Saturday&quot; programs designed for friends and family to experience the museum together.

Following the museum&#x27;s renovation, four new learning were established to teach about the museum and its collection. These are the Center for Conservation, the Center for Curatorial Studies, the Center for Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, and the Kimberly and John Simpson Center for Education.

==I.M. Pei-designed Building==
The building, designed by I.M. Pei and Partners, was completed in 1982. The museum was constructed as a play on angles. It is rumored to have no right angles, however this is not true. The floors meet the walls at a ninety-degree angle, and there are many square and rectangular windows in the building. The design features two concrete triangles connected by a glass-ceiling atrium. The museum is 105,000 square feet: 38,361 square feet are devoted to gallery space, and 18,000 square feet comprise the atrium. The other space is used for offices, gift shop, storage, and the outdoor Sculpture Terrace.

==Luzetta and Del Newkirk Café and Gift Shop==
The Luzetta and Del Café and Gift Shop, located on the second floor of the Eskenazi Museum of Art, sells an array of art-inspired products for guests to purchase, along with a selection of food and beverage options. The Newkirk Café has indoor seating, as well as outdoor seating located on the Sculpture Terrace.

In August 2019, the Eskenazi Museum of Art announced that a contemporary art installation by British designer Paul Cocksedge had been installed in the renovated café space. The installation, titled &quot;A Gust of Wind&quot;, is made up of satin-finish acrylic cast into sheets made to resemble paper. They are suspended from the ceiling and give the appearance of a cloud of sheets of white paper blowing into the museum&#x27;s Atrium from the outdoor Sculpture Terrace entrance.

==Light Totem==

The Light Totem installation at the Eskenazi Museum of Art was completed in 2007. It was commissioned as a temporary installation to celebrate the 25–year anniversary of the Eskenazi Museum of Art building. Due to its popularity with the campus and community, Light Totem was approved by the Board of Trustees to become a permanent fixture outside the museum in 2010. Artist Robert Shakespeare used LEDs (light-emitting diodes) to illuminate both the 70-foot freestanding tower, and the 40-foot tube within the atrium of the museum.

The Light Totem also illuminates the wall of the Art Museum with a computerized display of changing colors. Each of the lighted sections can be programmed to project any color and change color up to every tenth of a second. The entire display uses only 3,000 watts of electricity, about the amount used when a hair dryer and toaster are running simultaneously, according to the artist. Students often can be seen lying on their backs with their feet up on the wall, watching the colors change.

<doc id="426714" wikidata="Q526650" url="?curid=426714" title="Clifton Cathedral">
<text>The Cathedral Church of SS. Peter and Paul is the Roman Catholic cathedral of the city of Bristol (not to be confused with the Church of England Bristol Cathedral). Located in the Clifton area of the city, it is the seat and mother church of the Diocese of Clifton and is known as Clifton Cathedral. It has been a Grade II* Listed Building since 2000. A 2014 study noted it to be the only Catholic church built in the 1970s to have been Grade II* listed. It was the first cathedral built under new guidelines arising from the Second Vatican Council.

==History==
===Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Apostles===
Prior to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 32), Roman Catholics in Britain were banned from having public places of worship, and simply being a Catholic priest or running a Catholic school was liable to punishment with life imprisonment. By the time of Catholic Emancipation, and the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, Roman Catholics in Bristol had established a number of local places of worship, some of them in private houses, and in Clifton by the discreet purchase, through a third party, of a plot of land known as &#x27;Stoney Fields&#x27; in what is now Park Place, Clifton. In 1834, the construction of a church began there, but it was built on a challenging hillside site and had a history of problematic construction work, making work there difficult. Building stopped 1835, started again in 1843, stopped shortly after and the building lay abandoned until 1848 when a roof was placed on the half-completed building so that it could be used as a church. Two years later, in 1850, Clifton was made an episcopal see and the church became the Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Apostles (1850–1973), intended to act in this capacity until a more fitting cathedral church could be constructed.

===Move to Clifton Park===
The people of the ProCathedral parish had raised some £250,000 (1970) for restoration of the ProCathedral. However, with reports from the civil engineers in 1964 indicating that the ProCathedral site in Park Place was unsuitable, an anonymous group of local people added to this a donation of £450,000 (1970), on the condition that a new site was found.

From 1962 to 1965 the Second Vatican Council met in Rome, discussing the renewal of the Church in its relationship to the world. The council&#x27;s decree on liturgical worship focused on the role of the people, with the bishop and their priests in the celebration of the Eucharist. This was to be a strong influence in the design of the new Cathedral and, when built, the cathedral would be the first worldwide to be designed following the new guidelines.

In 1965, architects were commissioned by the Bishop of Clifton, Rt Rev Joseph Rudderham to undertake the design of a new Cathedral on a different site in Clifton. The design was primarily by Ronald J. Weeks, working with Frederick S. Jennett and Antoni Poremba of the Percy Thomas Partnership. Although the firm had little experience in ecclesiastical architecture, Ronald Weeks had contributed a design to the competition for Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, and had worked on a new Catholic church in Machynlleth.

== Design ==

=== The design brief ===

The design brief was for a 1,000-seat church, with the congregation grouped closely around the High Altar so that they should feel and be a part of the celebration of the Mass, in a building that would last 300 years. Ronald Weeks worked closely with the Church team to develop their ideas for the cathedral. &#x27;We are sure that only...a close working relationship between Architect and Client can achieve the level of &#x27;Architectural Seriousness&#x27; advanced by the New Liturgical Movement.&#x27; Although Weeks was not a Catholic, he thought that this was an advantage: &#x27;It&#x27;s surprising how much people take for granted. Not being Catholics we could ask all sorts of questions which appeared naïve – like – &quot;What is an altar?&quot;, in which one would get conflicting answers... each question would lead to a discussion which in turn helped to banish pre-conceived notions so we could plan right from scratch.&#x27; As Kulić puts it:

&#x27;The approach of Gibberd [at Liverpool] and Weeks were therefore quite different. Gibberd took on the role of art-architect in response to a lack of direction from the client. Weeks&#x27;s role was more that of a coordinator of the client&#x27;s requirements, weaving them into a hierarchical and meaningful whole...Weeks was more in tune with the collaborative sociological methods that had been adopted...in the immediate post-war period.&#x27; Kulić, comparing the design to that of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral (completed 1967), said: &#x27;Neither its bishop nor its architects appeared to wish to use architecture as a way of leaving a mark for posterity, as did both Heenon and Gibberd [at Liverpool]...Liverpool could be proved to be liturgically conservative and naïvely designed, while Clifton could be seen as a model of liturgically advanced and sophisticated planning...Weeks and the Clifton clergy...should be praised for their intimate and knowledgeable collaboration.&#x27;
=== A design emerges ===
Ronald Weeks presented many potential shapes and forms for the basic ground plan: one like a conch shell; a fan-shaped plan (rejected as it covered the whole of the available site); a circular plan; a coil-shaped plan, and a helix-shaped plan with great concrete beams in a swirling staircase reaching into the sky. The final design was based on groups of hexagons. For Ronald Weeks the &#x27;architecture then flowed logically form the functions, ...moulded in three dimensions to create the internal environment.&#x27;

The arrangement of the different parts of the church placed those of least (liturgical) importance on the periphery leading progressively to the more important elements and to the High Altar. The volume of the church expands from an intimate height to a soaring hexagonal spire over the High Altar, and the amount of daylight increases in proportion to the liturgical significance of the space. The concept was that on entering the cathedral at the Baptistery the people would be reminded of their own baptism (and entry into the Church), and from their places in the Nave participate fully in the celebration of the liturgy at a maximum of 15 metres [45 feet] from the High Altar with no pillars or columns intervening. Every effort was to be made to ensure that the interior should be free from distraction in order to help the worshippers to focus their attention on the Gospel being proclaimed and the service of worship in the liturgy, with no windows in the sight-line of the nave.

Kulić compares Clifton to Liverpool:&#x27; At Liverpool, the interior is cluttered with indecisive liturgical furnishings but these can easily ignored as the scale and form of the space, the central altar and baldachino, and colors (&quot;sic&quot;) of light predominate. At Clifton, the various elements of the interior are coherently placed and legible, while the exterior is unassuming. For example, lighting by daylight or electric light was to be concealed, as were any windows within the line of sight of those seated in the Nave. The interior of Clifton Cathedral has a quality of openness rather like that of Liverpool [cathedral], but this was intended to allow fluid movement between different areas, and the liturgical elements seem more definitely fixed and appropriate to their allotted places. If finally, there is a sense of certainty in this building, it is one of organiszation (&quot;sic&quot;) rather than of image.&#x27; Bishop Rudderham pronounced the final design satisfactory: &#x27;Having studied the drawings and the model inside and out I am very much more in tune with the design than I was at the beginning. It has a fine spacious feeling to it. And I think it will be a splendid setting for the liturgy. It brings the people as close as possible to the Altar without crowding them, and there will be plenty of room for our ceremonies.&#x27;

&#x27;Its planning is more succinct and successful than that at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral because it places the altar to one side, with a horseshoe of seating for the congregation. This quickly became a preferred alternative to the notion of seating entirely &#x27;in the round&#x27; because of the clearer view it gave everybody of the celebration.&#x27;

The contract construction price was agreed at £601,268 (1970), with the additional cost of the site and other fees this brought the total cost of the new building to £800,000 (1970) [estimated equivalent £11,764,705] – the tender included social space, with car parking for 200 cars and living accommodation for the clergy serving the parish.

=== Brutalist architecture ===
Often assumed to take its origin from the English word &#x27;brutal&#x27;, it is more likely from the French term &quot;&#x27;béton brut&quot;&#x27; meaning &#x27;raw concrete&#x27;, a term said to have been popularised by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier during the construction of the Unité d&#x27;habitation in 1952. Brutalism is characterised by simple, block-like structures, that are massive (if not necessarily large) and often repeated in a modular fashion. It typically features bare building materials, with the structure exposed entirely and without interior finishes wherever practicable. Concrete is often used for its raw and unpretentious honesty, revealing the basic nature of its construction, by showing the texture of the wooden planks used for the in-situ casting forms. Another key aspect of Brutalism is that the form of the building should be driven by its intended function, and fundamentally, the cathedral design at Clifton is inspired by the analysis of the practical liturgical requirements arising out of the decisions made about the Sacred Liturgy by the bishops assembled in Rome for the Second Council of the Vatican. In that sense it is functionalist, and the design, to a greater or lesser extent may have also been driven by the need for stringent cost economy.

==Construction==
Construction began in March 1970 by John Laing &amp; Son Ltd, with the contract price agreed at £601,268 – with the additional cost of the site and other fees this brought the total cost of the new building to £800,000. Phil Smith, of Felix J Samuely &amp; Partners was the site engineer; IE Symons &amp; Partners were the Quantity Surveyors, with Engineering Design Consultants having a responsibility for the environmental control, and Ken Murray acting as Clerk of Works. The foundation stone, carved by Simon Verity, was laid on 26 September 1970, and beneath the stone was placed a copper time capsule.

In May 1972, the construction came to a sudden halt due to a national building industry strike and did not resume until September that same year. By November 1972 the brick supports for the internal star beam were removed. Parish Priest Monsignor Thomas Hughes, Fr Peter Harrison &amp; Ken Murray carried out the traditional &#x27;topping out&#x27; ceremony in the Spring of 1973.

The building was completed in May 1973. That same year, on 29 June, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the new cathedral was consecrated and opened. Present were John Cardinal Heenan (Archbishop of Westminster), and twenty-nine bishops from around the United Kingdom, with Bishop Joseph Rudderham (7th bishop of Clifton); civic officials and councillors of Bristol; the Italian and Belgian consuls; the architects; Sir William &#x27;Kirby&#x27; Laing (representing John Laing Construction Ltd); the Anglican bishops of Bristol, of Bath and Wells, and of Salisbury. The pro-cathedral was closed and its sale provided fund for the new parish school, SS Peter and Paul on Aberdeen Road, Clifton.

Inscribed into the outside wall of the turret to the right of the Portal of Saint Paul and contained within an equilateral triangle is the symbol &#x27;√3&#x27; along with the letters PTP. This engraving makes a reference to the architects [Percy Thomas Partnership] and to the controlling mathematical formula used by Ronald Weeks in the design.

== Exterior ==
The cathedral is made from in-situ cast reinforced Portland concrete, with some pre-cast panels. The particularly fine, pale concrete has aged well. The imprint of the timber formwork used to mould the concrete can still be seen in the building. All the concrete was mixed by a single man. The vertical walls of the lower part of the building are clad with red Aberdeen Granite composite panels (made by 

Marble Mosaic Ltd), with roofing in lead. Rainwater is channelled through simple gargoyles into a number of semi-hexagonal pools around the building.

Inscribed into the outside wall of the turret to the right of the Portal of Saint Paul [see Exterior Plan]. Contained within an equilateral triangle is the symbol &#x27;√3&#x27; along with the letters PTP. This engraving makes a reference to the architects [Percy Thomas Partnership] and to the proportions of the equilateral triangle (and therefore regular hexagon) used by Ronald Weeks, which provide a deep symmetry in the design.
=== Flèche and spire ===
The hexagonal flèche rises to support a three-pronged spire, enclosing a cross. The spire contains two bronze bells, one of the few things transferred from the ProCathedral, by John Taylor &amp; Co (1901, tuned to F and C with diameters of 1&#x27;10&quot; and 2&#x27;5&quot;, and weights 1-3-26 and 4-2-26).

=== Ceremonial doors ===
The three original ceremonial doors (sponsored by Bristol City Council) were made of plywood pivoting on a central point, rendered with an artistic fibreglass by the artist William Mitchell, and bearing the Coat of Arms of the City and County of Bristol on one side and the arms of the Bishop of Clifton Dr Joseph Rudderham on the other side. The fibreglass render was similar to that found on the Ambo (Lectern). The current glass doors, installed in 1995, still bear the same crests.
=== Katyn Memorial ===
Close to the West Door [see Exterior Plan] is a large stone memorial to the Katyn Massacre, by Alexander Klecki, installed in 1985. Nearby are the graves of Rt Rev Mervyn Alexander, eighth Bishop of Clifton (1974–2001) and of Rt Rev Mgr Thomas Hughes, Vicar-General and first Parish Priest of the new Cathedral (1973–1981). The inscription on his gravestone reads: &quot;&#x27;Si monumentum quaeris circumspice&quot;&#x27; or &#x27;If you are looking for a monument, look around you&#x27;.

=== Presbytery ===
The clergy accommodation – Cathedral House – is located to the south of the cathedral and was designed by Irena Weeks, Ronald Weeks&#x27; wife, who was a designer and also trained at the Bartlett School of Architecture

==Interior==

=== Narthex ===
The narthex is a zone of transition from the busy world of everyday life outside, to a quieter and more intimate spiritual space within the cathedral.

The West Country artist Henry Haig designed the windows. The glass windows use a technique known as &quot;dalle de verre&quot; – shaped coloured glass pieces mounted in metal frames with epoxy resin – constructed from over 8,000 pieces of glass collected from England, France and Germany. The window closest to the Portal of St Paul is titled &#x27;Jubilation&#x27;, intended to express the Catholic concept of joy in God&#x27;s Creation, and prompted by the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s instructions on a duty of care for the environment. The window nearer the Portal of St Peter is titled &#x27;Pentecost&#x27;. Here the artist has created a swirling image to depict the experience of the Apostles after the death of Jesus, a moment of re-creation for the Church. 

=== Baptistery ===
The baptistery is located near to the entrance, to remind all those on entering the cathedral of the occasion when at their own baptism they first joined the assembly of God&#x27;s People. It is in full view of the people sitting in the nave. The font is partly surrounded by a pool and is lit from above by daylight through a hexagonal lantern (skylight), representing the illumination of baptism. The baptistery is lauded by Kulić: &#x27;The architects&#x27; treatment of the baptistery was exemplary and further demonstrates their [collaborative] approach...&#x27; The Font itself was carved from Portland stone by Simon Verity. Only after carving began did Verity realise that a complete fossil fish was present in the base of the font: &#x27;If I had only known it was there, I would have made it a feature of the interior of the font bowl that you can see today. So instead, I have carved the fishes chasing around the plughole!&#x27;. The bowl of the font does show fossilised sea creatures. Around the lip of the font are carved the words: &#x27;Once you were no people, now you are God&#x27;s People&#x27;. 

During baptisms the Paschal candle stands near the font (at other time it is on the sanctuary). The paschal candle stand is formed from segments of triangular stainless steel and was designed by Ronald Weeks. In the wall adjacent to the baptistery there are three Holy Oil tabernacles [F on Plan], for the retention of the Holy Oils used in the sacraments of the Church (the Oil of Catechumens, Oil of Chrism and Oil of the Sick).

=== Sanctuary ===
The sanctuary space [see Plan &amp; Section], containing the altar, is hexagonal. The weight-bearing star beam supporting the flèche and spire follows the edge of the sanctuary steps. It is 17 m (55 ft) high and pierced with hexagonal holes. On the sanctuary, symbolically closest to the baptistery, is the ambo (or lectern), used for reading the Scriptures. It is covered in fibreglass panels by William Mitchell (similar panels previously covered the three ceremonial doors). The altar [A on Plan], designed by Ronald Weeks, is made of Portland stone, raised on legs (visible from the side) and contains relics of Pope Pius X (1835–1914) and Oliver Plunkett (1625–1681). The lighting ensures that the sanctuary area remains the focus of the cathedral.

The bishop&#x27;s chair or cathedra [C on Plan] is what gives the church the name &quot;cathedral&quot;. Rather than a throne, here, it is a simple chair in a tall ash-wood surround bearing the coat of arms of Joseph Rudderham, seventh bishop of Clifton. Flanking the cathedra are rows of seating, in ash with Robin Day chairs, for the choir (right) and clergy (left). Symbolically, the congregation and clergy sit on the same chairs, indicating that all are equal before God.

=== Blessed Sacrament Chapel ===
Located through a tall archway from the sanctuary is the Blessed Sacrament Chapel [see Plan] a place of quiet prayer, as well as smaller or more intimate services. It contains an altar [A on Plan] and an ambo [B on Plan] as 

well as the tabernacle, used to store (&#x27;reserve&#x27;) the Eucharist [D on Plan]. Its location in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel reflects the view of the Second Vatican Council that the tabernacle should be separate from the high altar, in a place of prominence and accessible to the congregation.

The artist John Alder, with the guidance of Ronald Weeks, designed the stainless steel tabernacle to reflect the idea of a tent pitched among the people to reflect the original Jewish Tabernacle. The presence of the Eucharist is marked by a lit sanctuary lamp [E on Plan], designed by Ronald Weeks and executed in stainless steel. Brother Patrick, one of the monks of Prinknash Abbey in Gloucestershire, designed and made the steel railings bordering the space of the chapel.

On 22 March 2020 the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was used for the first live-streamed mass from the cathedral, by Bishop Declan Lang, due to the pausing of public worship as a public health measure during the 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic.
=== Organ ===
The cost of moving the ProCathedral organ was prohibitive, so a new organ designed by Josef von Glatter-Götz Jr of Rieger Orgelbau of Austria (with John Rowntree) was commissioned at a cost of £18,000 (1973). The triangular and hexagonal structure of the ash-wood casing was designed by Glatter-Götz &amp; Ronald Weeks. It was installed by Martin Pflüger. The organ has 1,830 pipes, with 26 speaking stops and no

extensions or no duplexing. The keyboard, pedal and stop action is entirely mechanical. Apart from 5 reversible foot pedals to the couplers (situated to the left of the swell pedal) there are no playing aids whatsoever. There is no III/I manual coupler. The keyboards are reversed with white sharps and ebony natural keys. The pedal board is a hybrid of the RCO standard pedal board specification (concave and radiating) and a straight pedal board as would have been found in earlier organs. The pedals extend to F and the manuals to G. The blower is a Swiss Meidinger model and the wind supply to the chests of the Schwimmer form.

=== Nave ===

There are no columns within the nave, due to the use of the interior star beam (which supports the flèche above). This ensures an uninterrupted view of the liturgy, for every member of the congregation.

The nave seating is uniform, and the same as the sanctuary, to reflect that all people are equal before God. The seating is around the lectern and altar space, reflecting a person&#x27;s sacramental journey within the Catholic Church. The Robin Day polypropylene chairs, are now recognised as a &#x27;British Design Classic&#x27; (In 2009 the polypropylene stacking chair was selected by Royal Mail to appear on a postage stamp as one of eight designs in a 2009 series celebrating &quot;British Design Classics&quot;. The cathedral is consulting on replacing the now 46-year-old chairs.

The nave and sanctuary lighting is carefully designed. There are no windows in the sight-line of the congregation and no distractions. Instead, the sanctuary is lit by daylight from hidden skylights in the flèche, supplemented by environmentally-friendly LED lighting designed by Lighting Design and Technology. The lighting is designed so that it is proportion to the liturgical significance of the area, so the sanctuary is the best-lit part of the cathedral. As Kulić noted: &#x27;At Clifton, the architects did not eschew aesthetic expression, but, as [an] example, manipulated light for its symbolic meanings.&#x27;

The acoustics of the nave were very important to the designers – in the days before loudspeakers a speaker&#x27;s voice needed to carry throughout the nave. The larger space over the nave is &#x27;tuned&#x27; to a reverberation time of about 1.5 seconds, while the sanctuary space offers the musicians a more satisfactory 7.5 seconds. The plywood tetrahedra in the nave ceiling are part of the acoustic scheme. The cathedral now has a modern loudspeaker system and T Loop, and the acoustics have been described as &#x27;first-rate&#x27;.

The nave flooring is made of hexagonal tiles. Richard Gordon, one of the architectural assistants, worked on a ground plan of the building and drew out each tile to determine the number of tiles required.

=== Ambulatory and Stations of the Cross ===
Whilst being primarily designed to allow free movement around the periphery of the cathedral, the columned ambulatory is also home to the fourteen Stations of the Cross [S on Plan]. These are episodes from the death (or Passion) of Christ and reflect parts of the &quot;via dolorosa&quot; in Jerusalem. Special permission had to be sought from the Holy See for the atypical Stations used in the cathedral. Originally intended to be executed in stone (it was thought that these would be damaged by later building work), the Stations were made by William Mitchell using Faircrete (a mixture of concrete, resin and nylon fibres). The artist was asked about what reaction people had to his work: &#x27;Well the work is a bit hairy I suppose, but then so was the experience of crucifixion.&#x27;

=== Sacristy ===
Beyond the organ the ambulatory leads to the sacristy, which is used for storing vestments and for robing by the choir and clergy. It is not typically open to the public.

=== Lady Chapel ===
The Lady Chapel is off the ambulatory, near to the narthex [see Plan]. It is a chapel dedicated to Mary, Mother of Christ. Terry Jones, a young student of sculpture studying at the University of Swansea, was commissioned to fashion in bronze &#x27;Mary the Woman of Faith&#x27; a simple design to reflect the deep significance of this woman as the Mother of God [G on Plan]. Rather than a queen dressed in finery, it depicts something closer to the truth: a simple peasant woman, without a young child in her arms.

The votive candelabra hanging in the Lady Chapel [H on Plan] is made from twenty stainless steel equilateral triangles (a regular icosahedron) and was designed and made by Brother Patrick, of Prinknash Abbey in Gloucestershire. It features in a pop music video (see Appearances in Media section).

Also in the Lady Chapel is a Lampedusa Cross [J on Plan]. This is made from wood from migrant boats destroyed in the Mediterranean and recovered from Lampedusa, Italy between 2012 and 2016. It is similar to the British Museum&#x27;s Lampedusa Cross and is intended to reflect Pope Francis&#x27;s 2017 &#x27;Share the Journey&#x27; exhortation for the Church to care for, and show solidarity to, all migrants and asylum seekers.

== 2015–2018 renovation ==
The 2015–2018 £3.1 million grant-funded renovation project (part-funded by £1.4m of grants from the World War I Centenary Cathedral Repairs Fund) was carried out by Bristol-based Purcell. It involved replacement of the lower, failed asphalt roofs and associated glazing, which were causing leaks and staining and risked closure of some areas of the building, as well as re-leading the higher roof with 86 tons (95 short tons, 77 long tons) of a thicker gauge of lead, and slight modifications to address leaks, working closely with the Lead Sheet Association to create long-lasting work that matched the building&#x27;s historic aesthetic. Repairs were made to the cladding areas where pieces had flaked or chipped off, using Corennie granite chippings that matched the original materials. A hexagonal glass roof on the left-hand turret of the Portal of St Paul was added to accommodate the fire escape from the roof terrace above the Baptistery.

== Clifton International Festival of Music ==
The cathedral&#x27;s &#x27;acoustics are first-rate, making the venue a popular one for some of Europe&#x27;s top classical ensembles.&#x27; The annual Clifton International Festival of Music started in 2013, showcasing classical, chamber and choral music. It has featured artists such as The Erebus Ensemble; Tom Williams (assistant director of Music at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London); The Tallis Scholars and the FIGO chamber group.

== Views of the cathedral architecture ==

=== Awards ===
In 1974 &#x27;The Concrete Society&#x27; bestowed its annual award on the cathedral in recognition of outstanding merit in the quality of the design and execution of the cathedral. The judges praised the interior as: &#x27;A masterpiece of design – only to be achieved in concrete – with form and material and good acoustics creating an atmosphere which most would find totally satisfying. It is a building where design and execution have gone hand in hand to create architecture. No other material could have been used to such effect.&#x27; In 2007 the cathedral was awarded the &#x27;Winner of Winners&#x27; Award. Martin Powell, chief executive of The Concrete Society, said: &#x27;Clifton Cathedral has a pleasing external appearance with little evidence of weathering or deterioration. Internally, the appearance is striking with excellent use of natural light on exposed concrete finishes, such as board mark and other patterned forms creating relief pictures.&#x27;

The Royal Institute of British Architects made an award in recognition of the outstanding architectural design of the cathedral It also received a Cembureau award for excellence.

=== Expert opinions ===
&#x27;A heart-lifting Christian temple, inspiring reverence but not awe. A sermon in concrete.&#x27;

Historic England, listing the cathedral as Grade II* Listed said: &#x27;Clifton Cathedral achieves a rare integration of materials and spatial quality which is remarkable for a cathedral of any period.&#x27; &#x27;The Percy Thomas Partnership produced a powerful and dramatic building, which is perhaps the most important work of one of Britain&#x27;s largest post-war architectural practices&#x27;

LAB, an offshoot of the Pevsner Architectural Guides, said:&#x27;Clifton Cathedral was beset with constraints: a small four acre site; an unpromising suburban context; and a small budget (c. £600,000 – the result was called the &quot;ecclesiastical bargain of the 1970s&quot;). Despite or because of these, and in less than eight years from commissioning to consecration, the architects and craftsmen produced a church of superlative quality. Paradoxically the structure is of considerable three-dimensional complexity, and yet the simple spatial arrangement is understandable the moment one enters the building. It attains a mystic simplicity through careful use of humble materials and masterly manipulation of light&#x27;George Perkin in Concrete Quarterly described it as &#x27;having a remarkable serenity and delight&#x27; coupled with &#x27;an apparent simplicity&#x27;.

Mary Haddock, in &quot;Building&quot; admired &#x27;the hint of theatre in the design; the absence of clutter and garish church ornament; the fine materials and the use of colour; the cold design in stained glass.&#x27;

Vladimir Kulić said:&#x27;The interior of Clifton Cathedral has a quality of openness rather like that of Liverpool [cathedral], but this was intended to allow fluid movement between different areas, and the liturgical elements seem more definitely fixed and appropriate to their allotted places.&#x27;... &#x27; At Liverpool, the interior is cluttered with indecisive liturgical furnishings but these can easily ignored as the scale and from the space...predominate. At Clifton, the various elements of the interior are coherently placed and legible.&#x27;Andrew Derrick said: &#x27;By contrast [to Brentwood Cathedral, consecrated 1991] the Percy Thomas Partnership&#x27;s concrete brutalist cathedral at Clifton was more monumental and permanent in character, betraying no suggestion of diffidence, and following a clearly determined post-conciliar liturgical programme.&#x27; &#x27;From the 1970s, one [church] building, Clifton Cathedral, is Grade II* (Listed)&#x27;Dr Robert Proctor says: &#x27;Clifton Cathedral has recently been accused of being a &#x27;relativist&#x27; and people-centred space, but the experience of the building rebuffs such charges as unfounded – its nave is focused on the sanctuary, and subsidiary spaces fixed in liturgically and symbolically appropriate places; ritual movement is woven into its architectural fabric; light and height give glimpses of transcendence and a clear sense of hierarchy.&#x27; and in a later book:&#x27;Liverpool Cathedral is something of an architectural precedent for Clifton, especially in the treatment of the podium (Weeks had entered the competition). Inside, the concrete trusses (sic, actually a star beam) over the sanctuary recall the cut-out beams at S. Maria dei Poveri in Milan; and the informal hexagonal geometry is typical of its period. But there is not much point looking for visual precedents with a building so clearly founded on a careful analysis of liturgical function.&#x27;...&#x27;If the suspicion remains that Clifton Cathedral is not quite as beautiful or exciting as it could have been, it is undeniably intelligent and valuable. Its owners seem to have changed very little in the building in thirty-four years... if Clifton&#x27;s exterior is, &quot;gaunt and forbidding&quot;, as one Catholic newspaper described it, &quot;will not satisfy everyone&#x27;s picture of what a church should look like&quot;, but... the interior and its spatial organisation function took precedence, while the exterior showed that the building was merely an envelope around the real human and divine Church that manifested itself in liturgical action.&#x27;Ray Newman, on brutalism says:&#x27;Bristol&#x27;s brutalist buildings, as well as being a pragmatic response to the post-war need to build quickly and cheaply, are powerful, sometimes even a beautiful presences in the cityscape... Among Bristol&#x27;s most exciting buildings of any style or vintage is the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Clifton by Percy Thomas &amp; Son. The thrusting spaceship-like spire can be seen for miles around and the more-or-less hexagonal church was apparently unpopular with conservation minded locals and worshippers when it arrived from its home planet in 1974. It was built using especially fine, pale concrete and so hasn&#x27;t aged as poorly as some similar buildings.&#x27;

<text>John Grosvenor Rowland (born May 24, 1957) is an American former politician, author, and radio host who served as the 86th governor of Connecticut from 1995 to 2004.

Rowland served three terms representing Connecticut&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991. A Republican, he was the first Connecticut governor to be elected to more than two terms since Wilbur Cross, who was elected to four consecutive terms in the 1930s. In July 2004, Rowland resigned from office amid a corruption investigation, and later pleaded guilty in federal court to a one-count indictment for conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, mail fraud and tax fraud. His lieutenant governor, Jodi Rell, replaced him as governor. Rowland served ten months in a federal prison until February 2006, followed by four months&#x27; house arrest at his home in West Hartford until June 2006.

In 2014, Rowland was indicted on seven counts for his role in an election fraud case where former congressional candidate Lisa Wilson-Foley, current vice chair of the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts and her husband, Brian Foley, pleaded guilty in federal court on March 31, 2014, to illegally paying Rowland $35,000 in campaign consulting fees. He was charged with two counts of falsifying records in a federal investigation, one count of conspiracy, two counts of causing false statements to be made to the FEC, and two counts of causing illegal campaign contributions. He was convicted on all seven counts in September 2014, and was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison in 2015. He was released in 2018.

== Early life and education ==
Rowland was born May 24, 1957 in Waterbury, Connecticut, the oldest of five children, to Sherwood L. Rowland (died 2000), an insurance agent, and Florence &quot;Cerie&quot; Rowland (née Jackson; 1931–2017). He has four younger siblings; Ned Rowland, Henry Rowland, Marnie Crawford (née Rowland) and Skip Rowland.

He attended and graduated from Holy Cross High School, a private high school, in Waterbury, Connecticut. Rowland received a Bachelor of Science from Villanova University in 1979.

==Career==

=== Politics ===
Rowland&#x27;s political career began in 1980 when, at age 23, he was elected to the Connecticut State House of Representatives. He held his seat until 1984, when he was elected to represent Connecticut&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives and was reelected in 1986 and 1988.

=== Consulting ===
After losing the 1990 gubernatorial race to Lowell Weicker, Rowland worked as a consultant for United Technologies Corp.

=== Tenure as Governor ===

Rowland was later elected governor in 1994 at age 37 (the youngest governor in Connecticut history) and later defeated two Democratic opponents: former US Congresswoman Barbara Bailey Kennelly (63%–35%) in 1998 and former State Comptroller Bill Curry (56%–44%) in 2002.

The Adriaen&#x27;s Landing project, the most ambitious capital city development project in decades in the state, continued to progress during Rowland&#x27;s time in office. On Rowland&#x27;s watch the state paid $37 million to TBI Construction to relocate Connecticut Natural Gas headquarters to East Hartford to make room for the development, TBI would later be at the center of the scandal that brought the Governor down.

In 1997 Rowland was the subject of the Geargate political scandal. Surplus military equipment intended for the Connecticut State Police was diverted by Rowland and close associates for their personal use. Equipment and apparel including sleeping bags, camouflage jackets, helmets, and a bayonet made their way into the hands of Rowland&#x27;s children, his staff, his security detail, and the husband of then Lt. Gov. Jodi Rell. The diversion was organized by corrupt State Trooper Eugene D’Angelo and was uncovered through a joint State Police and Department of Defense investigation.

In 1998, Rowland implemented the HUSKY Plan (Healthcare for UninSured Kids and Youth) to provide health insurance to uninsured Connecticut children. During his tenure, the budget for the Department of Children and Families more than doubled. Rowland supported addition to government of the state&#x27;s first Child Advocate.

Rowland was a strong proponent of a tough stance against violent crime as governor. The prison population grew rapidly during his term, which caused the state to send inmates to prisons in Virginia to deal with overcrowding. Legislative opponents of this policy such as Representative Michael Lawlor urged more rapid release of nonviolent offenders. After Rowland left office the Virginia inmates were returned to Connecticut and more criminals were paroled. This approach was criticized after the 2007 Cheshire home invasion murders committed by two &quot;nonviolent&quot; inmates paroled from Connecticut prison.

In early 1998, Rowland outlined plans to make Hartford an educational, cultural, and entertainment center. He outlined a &quot;Six Pillars of Progress&quot; initiative, which included the construction of a convention center, a higher education center, parking garages, housing, riverfront redevelopment, and the renovation of the Hartford Civic Center. By May 1998, the Connecticut General Assembly had authorized an initial $300 million to implement his urban renewal plan. Rowland established the Capital City Economic Development Authority, a quasi-state entity to oversee the implementation of his plan. Projects completed under this plan included the construction of Adriaen&#x27;s Landing and other work on improving the riverfront, renovation of the former G. Fox &amp; Co. department store so that it could house the new location of Capital Community College, and the Connecticut Convention Center.

In 2002 Lawrence Alibozek, former deputy chief of staff to the Governor, pleaded guilty to steering State contracts to the Tomasso Group, a contractor heavily involved with Rowland and his campaigns. The Tomasso Group&#x27;s relationship with Rowland included more than $500,000 in legal campaign contributions as well as hosting the Governor&#x27;s birthday at their Tunxis Country Club.

In 2003 Governor Rowland dismissed 2,800 state workers thus violating their union contracts. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City ruled in 2013 that the former Republican governor&#x27;s administration had violated the workers right to freedom of association. Many workers were eventually rehired or otherwise partially compensated. &quot;They lost benefits, they lost pension, they lost health insurance,&quot; creating &quot;real interference&quot; with people&#x27;s lives, said Union Attorney David Golub.

Before investigation into his conduct as governor started, Rowland was viewed as a rising star in the Republican Party, and was mentioned as a future presidential or vice-presidential candidate.

Rowland resigned abruptly as governor, July 13, 2004, as he faced impeachment and investigation for corruption. Lieutenant Governor M. Jodi Rell served out the remainder of his term. Rowland is the first Connecticut governor to have ever faced impeachment and he is the only Connecticut governor to have served prison time.

==Corruption case ==

===Resignation amid the threat of impeachment===
In the first year of Rowland&#x27;s third term (2003), rumors began circulating that contractors doing business with the state, primarily the Tomasso Group, paid for and made improvements to his private weekend home. Rowland initially denied the allegations, but in December 2003, he abruptly appeared on television and admitted that work had been done by contractors on his vacation home at no charge, and that his earlier statements to the contrary were untrue. He claimed that, since the work was done, he had paid the contractors in full; but in January 2004 an official investigation began into charges of corruption and whether he should face impeachment.

On June 18, the Connecticut Supreme Court required Rowland to appear before the investigative panel seeking his testimony, which could have resulted in him giving evidence against impeachment in the ongoing criminal investigation. On June 21, Rowland resigned, effective noon on July 1, 2004, amid a strong likelihood of impeachment.

=== Patty Rowland&#x27;s poem ===
Matters were exacerbated when the First Lady of Connecticut, Patty Rowland, wrote a satirical poem deriding the media for investigating her husband&#x27;s wrongdoing. The poem, a parody of the classic A Visit From St. Nicholas, was read by the First Lady at the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce on Dec. 17, 2003. The poem was published in its entirety in the New York Times the following day.

===Conviction===
On December 23, 2004, Rowland pleaded guilty to depriving the public of honest service. Rowland was sentenced on March 18, 2005, in New Haven, Connecticut, to one year and one day in prison, four months&#x27; house arrest, three years&#x27; probation and community service. On April 1, 2005, he entered Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto, in Pennsylvania. His federal inmate number was 15623-014.

===After release===
On February 10, 2006, Rowland was released from federal prison with the stipulation that he serve four months&#x27; house arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet monitor.

On July 1, 2006, Rowland spoke to an association of scholar athletes in Kingston, Rhode Island, about the lessons he learned.
A &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; and the &quot;arrogance of power&quot; were two of the biggest things that ended his political career, &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; quoted him as saying.

He warned that the arrogance is very easy when you&#x27;re put on a pedestal, and you &quot;start to believe your own press releases. ... It [becomes] all about me. You start to block out what else is around you.&quot;

The Courant quoted Rowland as saying that &quot;when you start to find yourself only concerned with yourself&quot; that&#x27;s the point when you need to find a &quot;grounding force.&quot; That should be faith, ideally, he said, or at least &quot;something within yourself&quot;—not just other people.

&quot;I found in my career that a lot of people will tell you how great you are—especially when you&#x27;re the boss. But there will be that time when that career will be over ... and then it&#x27;s down to the three F&#x27;s—faith, family and friendsreal faith, real family and real friends.&quot;

Rowland, now a resident of West Hartford, told the audience his future is still uncertain. He owes the Internal Revenue Service more than $35,000 and another $40,000 in fines. He said he&#x27;s a volunteer counselor and hoping to find a publisher for a book he wrote called &quot;Falling Into Grace.&quot;

In September 2006, local TV station WTNH, reported that Patty Rowland had purchased a house in Middlebury, Connecticut, and the Rowland family would be moving to that town.

Rowland discussed his life after politics in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article published June 17, 2007. Rowland discussed his work on the lecture circuit and the factors leading to his political demise. He also expressed disappointment that his successor, Governor M. Jodi Rell, had &quot;thrown him under the bus&quot; and distanced herself from him after taking office. Rell declined to criticize Rowland over these remarks.

In January 2008, Waterbury Republican Mayor Michael Jarjura announced that he would hire Rowland as an economic development advisor for the city. Rowland began work in February and received an annual salary of $95,000 as the city&#x27;s economic development coordinator. Rowland&#x27;s stint as Waterbury&#x27;s economic development coordinator ended in 2012.

===Radio show===
From 2010 until 2014, Rowland hosted the afternoon show on Hartford&#x27;s WTIC (1080).

On April 1, 2014, Connecticut governor Dannel P. Malloy called on WTIC to remove Rowland from the air due to Rowland&#x27;s implication in a corruption scandal involving former Congressional candidate Lisa Wilson-Foley. Malloy stated: &quot;The reality is that we now know enough—two people have pled guilty to this charge and have identified the party they were engaged with ... unless there&#x27;s going to be a denial and in light of two actual pleas, both identifying who the third party was, I think any reasonable outlet would remove him at this point […] He had the interesting position of trying to impact and influence political discourse on an afternoon radio show. That somebody would violate that trust as well is disturbing.&quot; Rowland has often criticized Malloy since the latter took office in 2011. On one occasion, Rowland labeled Malloy a &quot;pathological liar,&quot; although he later apologized to Malloy.

On April 3, 2014, just before 6 p.m. at the end of his regular three-hour time slot, Rowland announced that he was leaving as WTIC&#x27;s afternoon talk-show host &quot;to take care of some personal issues&quot;.

== Wilson-Foley campaign ==
On March 31, 2014, husband and wife Brian and Lisa Wilson-Foley, the Vice Chair of the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts Board of Trustees, pleaded guilty in federal court to corruption charges for illegally paying and afterwards hiding campaign consulting fees to the former governor, who is widely considered the main target for the federal probers. In 2012, Wilson-Foley ran for Congress in Connecticut 5th district. Rowland secretly served as a consultant to her campaign.

On September 8, Lisa Wilson-Foley&#x27;s husband, Brian Foley, told the jury that his wife had signed a fictional contract with Rowland to create the impression that Rowland was working for a group of nursing homes Foley owned. Instead, Rowland was providing political advice. Despite the statement, Rowland&#x27;s lawyers insisted that the client was a campaign volunteer and that he was paid for giving Foley advice on his healthcare business, not for being a political consultant. Shortly thereafter on September 16, first defense witness Bedard testified in accord with this line of defense. Bedard claims directly countered prosecutor&#x27;s charges: &quot;The healthcare and nursing home industry was changing and Brian hired him as a consultant to help us move forward,&quot; Bedard testified: &quot;The healthcare and nursing home industry was changing and Brian [Foley] hired him [Rowland] as a consultant to help us move forward. ... He knew the politics and practical ways to speed along Medicaid payments that were often delayed by between nine months to a year.&quot;

On September 19, 2014, Rowland was convicted on federal charges that he conspired to hide payment for his work on two congressional campaigns. He was convicted in New Haven federal court on all seven counts, including conspiracy, falsifying records in a federal investigation, causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election Commission, and causing illegal campaign contributions. On March 18, 2015, Rowland was sentenced to prison for 30 months by U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton. Judge Arterton also fined Rowland $35,000 and ordered him to serve three years of supervision by the federal probation office upon his release. Rowland turned down the opportunity to speak and appealed the sentence. His conviction was upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City on June 17, 2016. Rowland served less than the full 30-month term and was released from federal custody on May 26, 2018.

==Electoral history==








== Personal life ==
Rowland was first married to Deborah Joan Nabhan (born 1958), with whom he had daughters Kristen and Julianne. In 1994, Rowland who was then a 12-day governor elect, married his high school sweetheart Patricia Largay (née Oemcke), on Block Island, Rhode Island.

Rowland resided in Middlebury, Connecticut. In 2022, he purchased a historic Waterside Lane home in Clinton, Connecticut, which is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places for $800,000.

<doc id="426729" wikidata="Q1640984" url="?curid=426729" title="Hypercane">
<text>A hypercane is a hypothetical class of extreme tropical cyclone that could form if sea surface temperatures reached approximately , which is warmer than the warmest ocean temperature ever recorded. Such an increase could be caused by a large asteroid or comet impact, a large supervolcanic eruption, a large submarine flood basalt, or &quot;incredible&quot; global warming. There is some speculation that a series of hypercanes resulting from the impact of a large asteroid or comet contributed to the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs. The hypothesis was created by Kerry Emanuel of MIT, who also coined the term.

==Description==

In order to form a hypercane, according to Emanuel&#x27;s hypothetical model, the ocean temperature would have to be at least . A critical difference between a hypercane and present-day hurricanes is that a hypercane would extend into the upper stratosphere, whereas present-day hurricanes extend into only the lower stratosphere.

Hypercanes would have wind speeds of over , potentially gusting to , and would also have a central pressure of less than , giving them an enormous lifespan of at least several weeks. The pressure drop, compared to mean sea level pressure, would be the equivalent of being at almost in elevation, a level sufficient to cause altitude sickness. This extreme low pressure could also support massive storm systems roughly the size of North America. For comparison, the largest and most intense storm on record was 1979&#x27;s Typhoon Tip, with a 1-minute sustained wind speed of and a minimum central pressure of . Such a storm would be nearly eight times more powerful than Hurricane Patricia, the storm with the highest sustained wind speed recorded, which had 1-minute sustained winds of . However, hypercanes may be as small as in size, and they would lose strength quickly after venturing into colder waters.

The waters after a hypercane could remain hot enough for weeks, allowing more hypercanes to form. A hypercane&#x27;s clouds would reach into the stratosphere. Such an intense storm would also damage the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer, potentially having devastating consequences for life on Earth. Water molecules in the stratosphere would react with ozone to accelerate decay into O2 and reduce absorption of ultraviolet light.

==Mechanism==
A hurricane can be idealized as a Carnot heat engine powered by the temperature difference between the sea and the uppermost layer of the troposphere. As air is drawn in towards the eye it acquires latent heat from evaporating sea-water, which is then released as sensible heat during the rise inside the eyewall and radiated away at the top of the storm system. The energy input is balanced by energy dissipation in a turbulent boundary layer close to the surface, which leads to an energy balance equilibrium. 

In Emanuel&#x27;s model, if the temperature difference between the sea and the top of the troposphere is too large, there is no solution to the equilibrium equation. As more air is drawn in, the released heat reduces the central pressure further, drawing in more heat in a runaway positive feedback. The actual limit to hypercane intensity depends on other energy dissipation factors that are uncertain: whether inflow ceases to be isothermal, whether shock waves would form in the outflow around the eye, or whether turbulent breakdown of the vortex happens.

<text>USS &quot;S-5&quot; (SS-110) was a &quot;Government-type&quot; S-class submarine of the United States Navy. Her keel was laid down on 4 December 1917 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 10 November 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Glenn S. Burrell, and commissioned on 6 March 1920 with Lieutenant Commander Charles M. &quot;Savvy&quot; Cooke, Jr., in command. She sank accidentally during full-power trials on 1 September 1920, but due to actions by her crew and the crews of other ships, there were no deaths. Refloated, she was lost when she sank again while under tow on 3 September 1920.

==Loss==
===Sinking===
Following builder&#x27;s trials, outfitting, and crew training, &quot;S-5&quot; departed Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, on 30 August 1920 to undergo full-power trials in the Atlantic Ocean off the Delaware Capes. At 13:00 on 1 September, she commenced a dive for a submerged test run. Water unexpectedly entered the submarine through the main air induction system, pouring into the control room, engine room, torpedo room, and motor room.

Normal procedure was to leave the main air induction valve open until the engines had a chance to come to a full stop, this operation being so timed as to occur just prior to complete submergence. In the case of &quot;S-5&quot;, however, the chief of the boat, Gunner&#x27;s Mate Percy Fox, the man responsible for operating this valve, was momentarily distracted. Noticing the mistake, he grabbed the valve lever and jerked hard, causing the valve to jam open. After considerable difficulty, the system valves in the other compartments were closed, but all efforts to secure the torpedo room valve met with failure. The abandoned torpedo room flooded, making the boat bow-heavy. An additional of water in the motor room bilges caused her to settle on the bottom. It was now impossible to eject water from the torpedo room. An attempt was then made to pump out the motor room, but a gasket blew out and there were no means for repair. Lying on the bottom, the crew had little hope of being found, much less being rescued.

The crew reasoned that sufficient buoyancy in the after section could tilt the sub on her nose and extend the stern above the surface. The tilt would cause the water in the motor room to drain forward and increase buoyancy further. However, there was great risk involved because this would allow salt water into the battery room, which would generate deadly chlorine gas. They hoped to have enough time, after the water had entered, to close the watertight door before the gas could reach a dangerous level. After making preparations, air was applied to the after ballast and fuel tanks, blowing them dry. The stern began to rise and then shot to the surface. Men, floor plates, bilge water, and other loose objects fell through the length of the submarine. One man nearly drowned in the battery room, but was fished out, and the compartment door was sealed against the gas.

By tapping on the hull, it was determined that the stern extended about above the water. With inadequate tools, they took turns trying to cut a hole in the thick hull. After 36 hours, they had only succeeded in making a hole in diameter.

The steamship &quot;Alanthus&quot; detected the plight of the submarine. With additional assistance from the Panama Railway Company steamship , a much larger hole was cut, and the entire crew was rescued. A potentially apocryphal story about a conversation between the crews aboard the submarine and &quot;Alanthus&quot; has been published, but there is no support for it in the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; nor contemporary newspaper accounts.


Once the crew was offloaded from &quot;S-5&quot;, the battleship secured a towline to its stern and proceeded to tow her to shallower water. The towline, however, parted and the loose submarine bobbed, then plunged to the bottom about off Cape May, New Jersey. The Navy began an unsuccessful attempt to raise &quot;S-5&quot;, but called it off in November 1920. A second effort in 1921 also was unsuccessful, and &quot;S-5&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register that year. She was the fourth submarine lost in U.S. Navy history.

==Discovery of wreck==
The exact location of the wreck of &quot;S-5&quot; remained unknown until July 2001, when the Office of Ocean Exploration at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) asked the NOAA survey ship to search for it. &quot;Whiting&quot;, which had just completed a summer in port at Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts, to conduct hydrographic survey operations in New England, paused off Cape May in late July 2001 to search for the wreck.

&quot;Whiting&quot;″s survey department approached the project as it would any typical hydrographic survey. Information on snags – obstructions on the ocean bottom that snarl fishing nets and gear – that local recreational fishermen had reported and reports of possible locations of the wreck from divers that had visited it provided &quot;Whiting&quot; with possible targets for her search. After her crew had prepared a plan for a systematic search, &quot;Whiting&quot; moved from target cluster to target cluster, mapping the ocean bottom using sidescan sonar. After eight hours of searching, &quot;Whiting&quot; found the wreck of &quot;S-5&quot; directly over one of the suspected targets, made a sonar image of the wreck, and recorded its exact location. &quot;Whiting&quot; then made several more passes over the wreck to acquire additional images of it at various angles before leaving the scene.

==Museum holdings and displays==
The portion of &quot;S-5&quot;″s hull plating that &quot;General G. W. Goethals&quot; removed to permit &quot;S-5&quot;″s crew to escape from the submarine is on exhibit in the National Museum of the United States Navy in the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

NOAA donated the sonar data NOAAS &quot;Whiting&quot; gathered in 2001 during her discovery of the wreck of &quot;S-5&quot; to the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, for archiving and display.

<text>Gregorio López Fuentes (17 November 1897 – 10 December 1976) was a Mexican writer known for his best work &quot;A Letter to God&quot;. He was one of the leading causes of the Mexican Revolution. In his youth he spent much time in his father’s general store, where he came in contact with the Indians, farmers, and labourers of the region, whose lives he would later describe with deep insight. After unsuccessful efforts at poetry and novels, he began to draw upon his experiences in the Revolution. His first success, &quot;Campamento&quot; (1931; “Encampment”), was followed by several others dealing with aspects of the Revolution, including &quot;Tierra&quot; (1932; “Earth”), a novel about the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata; &quot;Mi general!&quot; (1934; “My General!”), a work on the lives of generals after the Revolution; and &quot;El indio&quot; (1935; “The Indian”), a fictional study of the life of Mexico’s indigenous race, his most celebrated work.

Later on, he became a teacher at a school in Mexico City. In 1921 he began writing under the G.L Fuentes pseudonym. His stories were seen as exciting and humorous for the people of Mexico. A realist, many of his works oppressed Native Americans. He was a contemporary of Mariano Azuela and Martín Luis Guzmán. 

He was awarded the National Prize of Arts and Sciences in 1935.

==Legacy==
GL Fuentes is well known for his writings in the Mexico Revolution. He was well known for his depictions of rural and peasantry of Mexico. He was one of the first recipients of the National Prize for Arts Mexico. He is also famous for his fictional story of &#x27;&quot;A Letter to God&#x27; which was included in English Textbook for Grade 10, NCERT. (as of 2024)

<text>Ruth Ann Minner ( Coverdale; January 17, 1935 – November 4, 2021) was an American politician and businesswoman who served as the 72nd governor of Delaware from 2001 to 2009. She previously served in the Delaware General Assembly from 1975 to 1993, and as the 23rd lieutenant governor of Delaware from 1993 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first female governor of Delaware. She was originally from Milford, in Kent County, Delaware.

==Early life and education==
Ruth Ann Coverdale was born on January 17, 1935, in Milford, Delaware, the daughter of Mary Ann (Lewis), a homemaker, and Samuel Coverdale, a sharecropper. While growing up, she left high school at age 16 to help support her family. Subsequently, she married Frank Ingram with whom she had three children: Frank Jr., Wayne, and Gary. When she was 32 her husband died suddenly of a heart attack in 1967, leaving her a single mother with three children. She earned her GED in 1968 and later attended Delaware Technical and Community College, while working two jobs to support the family. In 1969 she married Roger Minner and they operated a family towing business, the Roger Minner Wrecker Service. Roger Minner died of lung cancer in 1991.

==Professional and political career==
Minner began her political career as a clerk in the Delaware House of Representatives and as a receptionist in the office of Governor Sherman W. Tribbitt. In 1974 she was elected to the State House as a member of the &quot;Watergate Class,&quot; a group of newly elected legislators from both parties, who came into office on a &quot;good government&quot; mission and a strong sense of their ability to make significant improvements. Minner rose to become Delaware&#x27;s most powerful female politician, but she did it in a very conventional way, representing a rural, small town constituency, and building relationships and expertise by working in the legislative process over many years. She served four terms in the State House, from the 1975/1976 session through the 1981/1982 session.

At various times she served as House Majority Whip and chair of the powerful Bond Bill Committee. She also chaired the Rules Committee. In that role she led several successful reforming efforts, including a change that removed the rule allowing Representatives to table roll call votes. This rule was used to help schedule votes when only the right combinations of Representatives were on the floor.

In 1982, Minner was elected to the Delaware Senate and served there from the 1983/1984 session through the 1991/1992 session. While in the State Senate Minner sponsored the Delaware Land and Water Conservation Act, a key piece of legislation that protected 30,000 acres (120 km2) of land and created the Delaware Open Space Council. To fund the activities of this Council the General Assembly created the &quot;Twenty-First Century Fund&quot; from the proceeds of a multimillion-dollar corporate securities lawsuit. Elected Lieutenant Governor in 1992, she served two terms from January 19, 1993, to January 3, 2001. While in that position she chaired the Minner Commission on Government Reorganization and Effectiveness.

==Governor of Delaware==

Minner was elected Governor of Delaware on November 7, 2000. She had secured the Democratic nomination after her long years in the General Assembly, as Lieutenant Governor and her demonstrated ability to run a campaign by her large statewide victory margins in 1992 and 1996. Her opponent in 2000 was Republican John M. Burris, who had barely survived a bitter September primary contest with retired judge Bill Lee. Minner won easily. As the incumbent lieutenant governor, Minner took office upon the resignation of Governor Tom Carper on January 3, 2001, after he was elected to a seat in the U.S. Senate; those extra two weeks of tenure, along with her full two terms as governor make her the longest serving governor in Delaware history. Upon completing the unexpired term, Minner began her first full term on January 16, 2001, and was elected to a second term in 2004. She served as the first female president of the Council of State Governments in 2005.

Minner was Delaware&#x27;s fourth consecutive two-term governor and largely continued the business-oriented policies and bipartisan, consensus style begun by her Republican predecessor, Pete du Pont. She was usually described as a &quot;middle-of-the-road politician, with conservative fiscal views but progressive social policies.&quot; As governor, she worked to decrease cancer rates in Delaware, saying she &quot;was determined to reduce Delaware&#x27;s high cancer rates. A task force ... has created a road map of specific steps necessary ... and I am implementing that plan. [One] result has been ... the Clean Indoor Air Act, which has reduced cancerous pollutants in Delaware&#x27;s restaurants, bars and casinos by more than 90 percent.&quot;

Regarding education, she said, &quot;While it might be popular, it is not demanding to set standards that all students can meet right away ... Once high standards have been set, the key is to give our students, educators and parents the tools to continuously improve.&quot; She supported &quot;giving local schools control of [most] new education dollars ... expanding after-school and weekend class programs ... and supports reading and math specialists.&quot; She opposed vouchers. &quot;In 2005, she signed legislation creating the Student Excellence Equals Degree (SEED) Scholarship program, which enables students who keep their grades up and stay out of trouble to go to college for free in the state of Delaware. She also expanded her education specialist program, which has placed reading specialists in every elementary school, to also include a plan to place math specialists in every Delaware middle school.&quot;

On other issues she was &quot;a firm supporter of a measure that would simply add sexual orientation to the list of characteristics in the Delaware code ... that are not allowed to be used as basis for discrimination.&quot; She opposed &quot;new gun control legislation,&quot; but supported &quot;legislation requiring mandatory trigger locks and gun safety courses in schools.&quot; And she said &quot;I do not support additional sites or kinds of gambling ... the state should not become any more reliant on this form of revenue.&quot;

In her second inaugural address in January 2005, Minner concluded with this description of her philosophy: &quot;for Ruth Ann Minner, farmer, gardener and daughter of a sharecropper, it is simply this: Work hard. Do the right thing. And leave things better than you found them.&quot;

Before she left office on January 20, 2009, longtime senator Joe Biden had resigned January 15, 2009, after winning a seventh term, to become Vice President. Minner appointed Biden’s former chief of staff, Ted Kaufman to Biden’s Senate seat.

==Death==
Minner died under hospice care in Milford on November 4, 2021, at age 86, after complications from a fall. She died about 6 months after former governor Pete du Pont died on May 18, 2021, of multiple long illnesses.

<text>A radar speed gun, also known as a radar gun, speed gun, or speed trap gun, is a device used to measure the speed of moving objects. It is commonly used by police to check the speed of moving vehicles while conducting traffic enforcement, and in professional sports to measure speeds such as those of baseball pitches, tennis serves, and cricket bowls.

A radar speed gun is a Doppler radar unit that may be handheld, vehicle-mounted, or static. It measures the speed of the objects at which it is pointed by detecting a change in frequency of the returned radar signal caused by the Doppler effect, whereby the frequency of the returned signal is increased in proportion to the object&#x27;s speed of approach if the object is approaching, and lowered if the object is receding. Such devices are frequently used for speed limit enforcement, although more modern LIDAR speed gun instruments, which use pulsed laser light instead of radar, began to replace radar guns during the first decade of the twenty-first century, because of limitations associated with small radar systems.

==History==
The radar speed gun was invented by John L. Barker Sr., and Ben Midlock, who developed radar for the military while working for the Automatic Signal Company (later Automatic Signal Division of LFE Corporation) in Norwalk, Connecticut during World War II. Originally, Automatic Signal was approached by Grumman to solve the specific problem of terrestrial landing gear damage on the Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibious aircraft. Barker and Midlock cobbled a Doppler radar unit from coffee cans soldered shut to make microwave resonators. The unit was installed at the end of the runway at Grumman&#x27;s Bethpage, New York facility, and aimed directly upward to measure the sink rate of landing PBYs. After the war, Barker and Midlock tested radar on the Merritt Parkway. In 1947, the system was tested by the Connecticut State Police in Glastonbury, Connecticut, initially for traffic surveys and issuing warnings to drivers for excessive speed. Starting in February 1949, the state police began to issue speeding tickets based on the speed recorded by the radar device. In 1948, radar was also used in Garden City, New York.

==Mechanism==
===Doppler effect===
Radar speed guns use Doppler radar to perform speed measurements.

Radar speed guns, like other types of radar, consist of a radio transmitter and receiver. They send out a radio signal in a narrow beam, then receive the same signal back after it bounces off the target object. Due to a phenomenon called the Doppler effect, if the object is moving toward or away from the gun, the frequency of the reflected radio waves when they come back is different from the transmitted waves. When the object is approaching the radar, the frequency of the return waves is higher than the transmitted waves; when the object is moving away, the frequency is lower. From that difference, the radar speed gun can calculate the speed of the object from which the waves have been bounced. This speed is given by the following equation:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the speed of light, formula_3 is the emitted frequency of the radio waves, and formula_4 is the difference in frequency between the radio waves that are emitted and those received back by the gun. This equation holds precisely only when object speeds are low compared to that of light, but in everyday situations, this is the case and the velocity of an object is directly proportional to this difference in frequency.

===Stationary radar===
After the returning waves are received, a signal with a frequency equal to this difference is created by mixing the received radio signal with a little of the transmitted signal. Just as two different musical notes played together create a beat note at the difference in frequency between them, so when these two radio signals are mixed they create a &quot;beat&quot; signal (called a heterodyne). An electrical circuit then measures this frequency using a digital counter to count the number of cycles in a fixed time period, and displays the number on a digital display as the object&#x27;s speed.

Since this type of speed gun measures the difference in speed between a target and the gun itself, the gun must be stationary in order to give a correct reading. If a measurement is made from a moving car, it will give the difference in speed between the two vehicles, not the speed of the target relative to the road, so a different system has been designed to work from moving vehicles.

===Moving radar===
In so-called &quot;moving radar&quot;, the radar antenna receives reflected signals from both the target vehicle and stationary background objects such as the road surface, nearby road signs, guard rails and streetlight poles. Instead of comparing the frequency of the signal reflected from the target with the transmitted signal, it compares the target signal with this background signal. The frequency difference between these two signals gives the true speed of the target vehicle.

===Design considerations===
Modern radar speed guns normally operate at X, K, Ka, and (in Europe) Ku bands.

Radar guns that operate using the X band (8 to 12 GHz) frequency range are becoming less common because they produce a strong and easily detectable beam. Also, most automatic doors utilize radio waves in the X band range and can possibly affect the readings of police radar. As a result, K band (18 to 27 GHz) and Ka band (27 to 40 GHz) are most commonly used by police agencies.

Some motorists install radar detectors which can alert them to the presence of a speed trap ahead, and the microwave signals from radar may also change the quality of reception of AM and FM radio signals when tuned to a weak station. For these reasons, hand-held radar typically includes an on-off trigger and the radar is only turned on when the operator is about to make a measurement. Radar detectors are illegal in some areas.

==Limitations==
Traffic radar comes in many models. Hand-held units are mostly battery powered, and for the most part are used as stationary speed enforcement tools. Stationary radar can be mounted in police vehicles and may have one or two antennae. Moving radar is employed, as the name implies, when a police vehicle is in motion and can be very sophisticated, able to track vehicles approaching and receding, both in front of and behind the patrol vehicle and also able to track multiple targets at once. It can also track the fastest vehicle in the selected radar beam, front or rear.

However, there are a number of limitations to the use of radar speed guns. For example, user training and certification are required so that a radar operator can use the equipment effectively, with trainees being required to consistently visually estimate vehicle speed within +/-2 mph of actual target speed, for example if the target&#x27;s actual speed is 30 mph then the operator must be able to consistently visually estimate the target speed as falling between 28 and 32 mph. Stationary traffic enforcement radar must occupy a location above or to the side of the road, so the user must understand trigonometry to accurately estimate vehicle speed as the direction changes while a single vehicle moves within the field of view. Actual vehicle speed and radar measurement thus are rarely the same due to what is known as the cosine effect, however, for all practical purposes this difference in actual speed and measured speed is inconsequential, generally being less than 1 mph difference, as police are trained to position the radar to minimize this inaccuracy and when present the error is always in the favor of the driver reporting a lower than actual speed.

Additionally, the placement of the radar can be important as well to avoid large reflective surfaces near the radar. Such reflective surfaces can create a multi-path scenario where the radar beam can be reflected off of the unintended reflective target and find another target and return thereby causing a reading that can be confused for the traffic being monitored. However, &quot;MythBusters&quot; did an episode on trying to get the gun to have incorrect readings by changing the surface of the passing object and found no significant effect.

Radar speed guns do not differentiate between targets in traffic, and proper operator training is essential for accurate speed enforcement. This inability to differentiate among targets in the radar&#x27;s field of view is the primary reason for the operator being required to consistently and accurately visually estimate target speeds to within +/-2 mph, so that, for example if there are seven targets in the radar&#x27;s field of view and the operator is able to visually estimate the speed of six of those targets as approximately 40 mph and visually estimate the speed of one of those targets as approximately 55 mph and the radar unit is displaying a reading of 56 mph it becomes clear which target&#x27;s speed the unit is measuring.

In moving radar operation, another potential limitation occurs when the radar&#x27;s patrol speed locks onto other moving targets rather than the actual ground speed. This can occur if the position of the radar is too close to a larger reflective target such as a tractor trailer. To help alleviate this the use of secondary speed inputs from the vehicle&#x27;s CAN bus, VSS signal, or the use of a GPS-measured speed can help to reduce errors by giving a secondary speed to compare the measured speed against.

===Size===
The primary limitation of hand held and mobile radar devices is size. An antenna diameter of less than several feet limits directionality, which can only partly be compensated for by increasing the frequency of the wave. Size limitations can cause hand-held and mobile radar devices to produce measurements from multiple objects within the field of view of the user.

The antenna on some of the most common hand-held devices is only in diameter. The beam of energy produced by an antenna of this size using X-band frequencies occupies a cone that extends about 22 degrees surrounding the line of sight, 44 degrees in total width. This beam is called the main lobe. There is also a side lobe extending from 22 to 66 degrees away from the line of sight, and other lobes as well, but side lobes are about 20 times (13 dB) less sensitive than the main lobe, although they will detect moving objects close by. The primary field of view is about 130 degrees wide. K-band reduces this field of view to about 65 degrees by increasing the frequency of the wave. Ka-band reduces this further to about 40 degrees. Side lobe detections can be eliminated using side lobe blanking which narrows the field of view, but the additional antennas and complex circuitry impose size and price constraints that limit this to applications for the military, air traffic control, and weather agencies. Mobile weather radar is mounted on semi-trailer trucks in order to narrow the beam.

===Distance===
A second limitation for hand-held devices is that they have to use continuous-wave radar to make them light enough to be mobile. Speed measurements are only reliable when the distance at which a specific measurement has been recorded is known. Distance measurements require pulsed operation or cameras when more than one moving object is within the field of view. Continuous-wave radar may be aimed directly at a vehicle 100 yards away but produce a speed measurement from a second vehicle 1 mile away when pointed down a straight roadway. Once again falling back on the training and certification requirement for consistent and accurate visual estimation so that operators can be certain which object&#x27;s speed the device has measured without distance information, which is unavailable with continuous wave radar.

Some sophisticated devices may produce different speed measurements from multiple objects within the field of view. This is used to allow the speed-gun to be used from a moving vehicle, where a moving and a stationary object must be targeted simultaneously, and some of the most sophisticated units are capable of displaying up to four separate target speeds while operating in moving mode once again emphasizing the importance of the operators&#x27; ability to consistently and accurately visually estimate speed.

===Environment===
The environment and locality in which a measurement is taken can also play a role. Using a hand-held radar to scan traffic on an empty road while standing in the shade of a large tree, for example, might risk detecting the motion of the leaves and branches if the wind is blowing hard (side lobe detection). There may be an unnoticed airplane overhead, particularly if there is an airport nearby, which again emphasizes the importance of proper operator training.

==Associated cameras==
Conventional radar gun limitations can be corrected with a camera aimed along the line of sight.

Cameras are associated with automated ticketing machines (known in the UK as speed cameras) where the radar is used to trigger a camera. The radar speed threshold is set at or above the maximum legal vehicle speed. The radar triggers the camera to take several pictures when a nearby object exceeds this speed. Two pictures are required to determine vehicle speed using roadway survey markings. This can be reliable for traffic in city environments when multiple moving objects are within the field of view. It is the camera, however, and its timing information, in this case, that determines the speed of an individual vehicle, the radar gun simply alerting the camera to start recording.

==Newer instruments==
Laser devices, such as a LIDAR speed gun, are capable of producing reliable range and speed measurements in typical urban and suburban traffic environments without the site survey limitation and cameras. This is reliable in city traffic because LIDAR has directionality similar to a typical firearm because the beam is shaped more like a pencil that produces measurement only from the object it has been aimed at.

<doc id="426741" wikidata="Q5156990" url="?curid=426741" title="Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration">
<text>The Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration was set up in 1971, laying the guidelines for Comecon activity until 1990. The distinction between &quot;market&quot; relations and &quot;planned&quot; relations, made in the discussions within Comecon before the adoption of the 1971 Comprehensive Program, is still a useful approach to understanding Comecon activities. Comecon remained in fact a mixed system, combining elements of both plan and market economies. Although official rhetoric emphasized regional planning, it must be remembered that intra-Comecon relations continued to be conducted among national entities not governed by any supranational authority. They thus interacted on a decentralized basis according to terms negotiated in bilateral and multilateral agreements on trade and co-operation.

==Market relations and instruments==
It is not surprising, given the size of the Soviet economy, that intra-Comecon trade was dominated by exchanges between the Soviet Union and the other members. Exchanges of Soviet fuels and raw materials for capital goods and manufactured items for consumer consumption had characterized trade, particularly among the original members. The liquidity shortage in the early 1980s forced the European Comecon countries to work to strengthen the importance of intraregional trade. In the early 1980s, intraregional trade rose to 60% of foreign trade of Comecon countries as a whole; for individual members it ranged from 45 to 50% in the case of Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union, to 83% for Cuba and 96% for Mongolia.

Trade among the members was negotiated on an annual basis and in considerable detail at the governmental level and was then followed up by interenterprise contracts. Early Comecon efforts to facilitate trade among members concentrated on development of uniform technical, legal, and statistical standards and on encouragement of long-term trade agreements. The 1971 Comprehensive Program sought to liberalize the system somewhat by recommending broad limits to &quot;fixed-quota&quot; trade among members (trade subject to quantitative or value targets set by bilateral trade agreements). Section VI, Paragraph 19 of the Comprehensive Program affirms that &quot;mutual trade in commodities for which no quotas were established shall be carried on beginning in 1971 with a view to stimulating the development of trade turnover, through expansion of the range and assortment of traded commodities, and to making trade in these commodities more brisk.&quot; Later in the same paragraph the Comprehensive Program called on members to &quot;seek opportunities to develop the export and import of quota-free commodities and to create conditions essential for trade in such commodities.&quot; There was no evidence, however, that this appeal has had significant effect or that quota-free trade has grown in importance under the program.

===Prices===

The 1971 Comprehensive Program also called for improvement in the Comecon system of foreign trade prices. Administratively set prices, such as those used in intra-Comecon trade, did not reflect costs or relative scarcities of inputs and outputs. For this reason, intra-comecon trade has been based on world market prices. By 1971 a price system governing exchanges among members had developed, under which prices agreed on through negotiation were fixed for five-year periods (corresponding to those of the synchronized, five-year plans of the members). These contract prices were based on adjusted world market prices averaged over the immediately preceding five years; that is, a world-price base was used as the starting point for negotiation. Under this system, therefore, intra-Comecon prices could and did depart substantially from relative prices on world markets.

Although the possibility of breaking this tenuous link with world prices and developing an indigenous system of prices for the Comecon market had been discussed in the 1960s, the evolution of Comecon prices after 1971 went in the opposite direction. Far from a technical or academic matter, the question of prices underlaid vital issues of the terms of, and hence gains from, intra-Comecon trade. In particular, relative to actual world prices, intra-Comecon prices in the early 1970s penalized raw materials exporters and benefited exporters of manufacturers. After the oil price explosion of 1973, Comecon foreign trade prices swung still further away from world prices to the disadvantage of Comecon suppliers of raw materials, in particular the Soviet Union. In view of the extraregional opportunities opened up by the expansion of east–west trade, this yawning gap between Comecon and world prices could no longer be ignored. Hence in 1975, at Soviet instigation, the system of intra-Comecon pricing was reformed.

The reform involved a substantial modification of existing procedures (known as the &quot;Bucharest formula,&quot; from the location of the 9th Council Session in 1958 at which it was adopted), but not their abandonment. Under the modified Bucharest formula (which remained in effect in the late 1980s), prices were fixed every year and were based on a moving average of world prices for the preceding five years. The world-price base of the Bucharest formula was thus retained and still represented an average (although now moving) of adjusted world prices for the preceding five years. For 1975 alone, however, the average was for the preceding three years. Under these arrangements, intra-Comecon prices were more closely linked with world prices than before and throughout the remainder of the 1970s rose with world prices, although with a lag. Until the early 1980s, this new system benefited both the Soviet Union and the other Comecon countries since Soviet oil, priced with the lagged formula, was considerably cheaper than Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil, the price of which increased drastically in the 1970s. By 1983-84 this system turned to the Soviet Union&#x27;s advantage because world market oil prices began to fall, whereas the lagged Soviet oil prices continued to rise.

===Exchange rates and currencies===
Basic features of the state trading systems of the Comecon countries were multiple exchange rates and comprehensive exchange controls that severely restricted the convertibility of members&#x27; currencies.

These features were rooted in the planned character of the members&#x27; economies and their systems of administered prices. Currency inconvertibility in turn dictated bilateral balancing of accounts, which has been one of the basic objectives of intergovernmental trade agreements among members. An earlier system of bilateral clearing accounts was replaced on January 1, 1964, by accounts with the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, using the transferable rouble as the unit of account. Although the bank provided a centralized mechanism of trade accounting and swing credits to cover temporary imbalances, it could not establish a system of multilateral clearing because of the centrally planned nature of the members&#x27; economies and the inconvertibility of their currencies. In 1987, the transferable rouble remained an artificial currency functioning as an accounting unit and was not a common instrument for multilateral settlement. For this reason, this currency continued to be termed &quot;transferable&quot; and not &quot;convertible.&quot;

The member countries recognized that the multiplicity and inconsistency of their administered exchange rates, the separation of their domestic prices from foreign prices, and the inconvertibility of their currencies were significant obstacles to multilateral trade and cooperation. As of early 1987, Comecon lacked not only a flexible means of payment but also a meaningful, standard unit of account. Both problems have vastly complicated the already complex multilateral projects and programs envisaged by the Comprehensive Program. The creation in 1971 of the International Investment Bank provided a mechanism for joint investment financing, but, like the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, this institution could not by itself resolve these fundamental monetary problems.

Recognizing that money and credit should play a more active role in the Comecon system, the Comprehensive Program established a timetable for the improvement of monetary relations. According to the timetable, measures would be taken &quot;to strengthen and extend&quot; the functions of the &quot;collective currency&quot; (the transferable rouble), and the conditions would be studied and prepared &quot;to make the transferable rouble convertible into national currencies and to make national currencies mutually convertible.&quot; To this end, steps would be taken to introduce &quot;economically well-founded and mutually coordinated&quot; rates of exchange between members&#x27; currencies and &quot;between 1976 and 1979&quot; to prepare the groundwork for the introduction by 1980 of a &quot;single rate of exchange for the national currency of every country.&quot; This timetable was not met. Only in Hungary were the conditions for convertibility gradually being introduced by reforms intended to link domestic prices more directly to world prices.

==Cooperation in planning==
If countries are to gain from trade, that trade must be based on rational production structures reflecting resource scarcities. Since the early 1960s, official Comecon documents have stressed the need to promote among members&#x27; economies a more cost-effective pattern of specialization in production. This &quot;international socialist division of labor&quot; would, especially in the manufacturing sector, involve specialization within major branches of industry. In the absence of significant, decentralized allocation of resources within these economies, however, production specialization can be brought about only through the mechanism of the national plan and the investment decisions incorporated in it. In the absence at the regional level of supranational planning bodies, a rational pattern of production specialization among members&#x27; economies required coordination of national economic plans, a process that was not merely technical but also posed inescapable political problems.

The coordination of national five-year economic plans was the most traditional form of cooperation among the members in the area of planning. Although the process of consultation underlying plan coordination remained essentially bilateral, Comecon organs were indirectly involved. The standing commissions drew up proposals for consideration by competent, national planning bodies; the assembled information on the results of bilateral consultations; and the Council Committee for Cooperation in Planning (created by Comecon in 1971 at the same session at which the Comprehensive Program was adopted) reviewed the progress of plan coordination by members.

In principle, plan coordination covered all economic sectors. Effective and comprehensive plan coordination has, however, been significantly impeded by the continued momentum of earlier parallel development strategies and the desire of members to minimize the risks of mutual dependence (especially given the uncertainties of supply that were characteristic of the members&#x27; economies). Plan coordination in practice, therefore, remained for the most part limited to mutual adjustment, through bilateral consultation, of the foreign trade sectors of national five-year plans. Under the Comprehensive Program, there were efforts to extend plan coordination beyond foreign trade to the spheres of production, investment, science, and technology.

===Plan coordination===
According to the 1971 Comprehensive Program, joint planning, multilateral or bilateral, was to be limited to &quot;interested countries and was &quot;not to interfere with the autonomy of internal planning.&quot; Participating countries would, moreover, retain national ownership of the productive capacities and resources jointly planned. But &quot;joint plans worked out by the member countries would be taken into account by them when drafting their long-term or five-year plans.&quot;

The Comprehensive Program did not clearly assign responsibility for joint planning to any single agency. On the one hand, &quot;coordination of work concerned with joint planning shall be carried out by the central planning bodies of Comecon member countries or their authorized representatives.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;decisions on joint, multilateral planning of chosen branches and lines of production by interested countries shall be based on proposals by countries or Comecon agencies and shall be made by the Comecon Executive Committee, which also determines the Comecon agencies responsible for the organization of such work.&quot; Finally, mutual commitments resulting from joint planning and other aspects of cooperation were to be incorporated in agreements signed by the interested parties.

It was extremely difficult to gauge the implementation of plan coordination or joint planning under the Comprehensive Program or to assess the activities of the diverse international economic organizations. There was no single, adequate measure of such cooperation. The only data on activities among the Comecon countries published by the annual Comecon yearbooks referred to merchandise trade, and these trade figures could not be readily associated with cooperative measures taken under the Comprehensive Program. Occasional official figures were published, however, on the aggregate number of industrial specialization and co-production agreements signed by members.

===Joint projects===
The clearest area of achievement under the Comprehensive Program has been the joint exploitation and development of natural resources for the economies of the member countries. Joint projects eased the investment burden on a single country when expansion of its production capacity was required to satisfy the needs of other members. Particular attention has been given to energy and fuels, forest industries, iron and steel, and various other metals and minerals. Most of this activity was carried out in the former Soviet Union, the great storehouse of natural resources within Comecon.

Joint development projects were usually organized on a &quot;compensation&quot; basis, a form of investment &quot;in kind.&quot; Participating members advance materials, equipment and, more recently, manpower and were repaid through scheduled deliveries of the output resulting from, or distributed through, the new facility. Repayment included a modest &quot;fraternal&quot; rate of interest, but the real financial return to the participating countries depended on the value of the output at the time of delivery. Deliveries at contract prices below world prices would provide an important extra return. No doubt the most important advantage from participation in joint projects, however, was the guarantee of long-term access to basic fuels and raw materials in a world of increasing uncertainty of supply of such products.

===Concerted Plan===
The multilateral development projects concluded under the Comprehensive Program formed the backbone of Comecon&#x27;s Concerted Plan for the 1976-80 period. The program allotted 9 billion roubles (nearly US$12 billion at the official 1975 exchange rate of US$1.30 per rouble) for joint investments. The Orenburg project was the largest project under the Comprehensive Program. It was undertaken by all East European Comecon countries and the Soviet Union at an estimated cost ranging from the equivalent of US$5 billion to US$6 billion, or about half of the cost of all Comecon projects under the Concerted Plan. It consisted of a natural gas complex at Orenburg in western Siberia and the 2,677-kilometer Union (Soiuz) natural-gas pipeline, completed in 1978, which links the complex to the western border of the Soviet Union. Construction of a pulp mill in Ust&#x27; Ilim (in central Siberia) was the other major project under this program.

These two projects differed from other joint Comecon investments projects in that they were jointly planned and jointly built in the host country (the Soviet Union in both cases). Although the other projects were jointly planned, each country was responsible only for construction within its own borders. Western technology, equipment, and financing played a considerable role. The Soviet Union owned the Orenburg complex and the Ust&#x27; Ilim installation and was repaying its East European co-investors at a 2% interest rate with an agreed-upon amount of natural gas and wood pulp.

The early 1980s were characterized by more bilateral investment specialization but on a much smaller scale than required for the Orenburg and Ust&#x27; Ilim projects. In these latter projects, Eastern Europe provided machinery and equipment for Soviet multilateral resource development. Work also progressed on the previously mentioned Long-Term Target Programs for Cooperation.

===Cooperation in science and technology===
To supplement national efforts to upgrade indigenous technology, the 1971 Comprehensive Program emphasized cooperation in science and technology. The development of new technology was envisaged as a major object of cooperation; collaboration in resource development and specialization in production were to be facilitated by transfers of technology between members. The 1971 Comecon session, which adopted the Comprehensive Program, decided to establish the Special Council Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation to ensure the organization and fulfillment of the provisions of the program in this area. Jointly planned and coordinated research programs have extended to the creation of joint research institutes and centers. In terms of number of patents, documents, and other scientific and technical information exchanges, the available data indicate that the Soviet Union has been the dominant source of technology within Comecon. It has, on the whole, provided more technology to its East European partners than it has received from them, although the balance varies considerably from country to country depending upon relative levels of industrial development. Soviet science also formed the base for several high-technology programs for regional specialization and cooperation, such as nuclear power and computers (see ES EVM).

The Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress up to the Year 2000, adopted in December 1985, has boosted cooperation in science and technology in the late 1980s. The program set forth 93 projects and 800 subprojects within 5 broad areas of development. A Soviet ministry supervised each of the areas and was responsible for the technical level and quality of output, compliance with research and production schedules, costs, and sales. Each project was headed by a Soviet organization, which awarded contracts to other Comecon-member organizations. The Soviet project heads, who were not responsible to domestic planners, had extensive executive powers of their own and will closely supervise all activities. The program represented a fundamentally new approach to multilateral collaboration and a first step toward investing Comecon with some supranational authority.

===Labor resources===
Just as the 1971 Comprehensive Program stimulated investment flows and technology transfers among members, it also increased intra-Comecon flows of another important factor of production: labor. Most of the transfers occurred in connection with joint resource development projects, e.g., Bulgarian workers aiding in the exploitation of Siberian forest resources, Polish workers assisting in the construction of the Union pipeline, or Vietnamese workers helping on the Friendship pipeline in the Soviet Union. Labor was also transferred in response to labor imbalances in member countries. Hungarian workers, for example, were sent to work in East Germany under a bilateral agreement between the two countries. Such transfers, however, are restricted by the universal scarcity of labor that has emerged with the industrialization of the less developed Comecon countries. Moreover, the presence of foreign workers has raised practical and ideological issues in socialist planned economies. Cooperation in the area of labor has been by no means limited to planned exchanges of manpower. Comecon countries have exchanged information on experience in manpower planning and employment and wage policies through Comecon organs and activities.

==Changes in the mid-1980s==
By 1987, Comecon&#x27;s Comprehensive Program, adopted in 1971, had undergone considerable change. Multilateral planning faded into traditional bilateral cooperation, and the Bucharest formula for prices assumed a revised form. The 1985 Comprehensive Program for the Development of Science and Technology or, as some Western analysts call it, the &quot;Gorbachev Charter,&quot; was Comecon&#x27;s new blueprint for taking a firm grip on its future. Experience in the early 1980s showed that turning to the West and Japan for technological advancement put Comecon in a very dangerous position because it pulled the East European members further away from the Soviet Union and threatened to leave the entire organization at the mercy of the West. The purpose of the 1985 program was to offset centrifugal forces and reduce Comecon&#x27;s vulnerability to &quot;technological blackmail&quot; through broadened mutual cooperation, increased efficiency of cooperation, and improved quality of output.

The success of the 1985 program would be closely tied to the success of Gorbachev&#x27;s changes in the Soviet economy. Major projects for the 1986-90 period included a 5,600 km natural-gas pipeline from the Yamburg Peninsula (in northern Siberia) to Eastern Europe; the Krivoy Rog (in the Ukraine), a mining and enrichment combine that would produce 13 million tons of iron ore annually; the production and exchange of 500 million roubles&#x27; worth (approximately US$650 million) of equipment for nuclear power plants; and joint projects for extracting coal in Poland, magnesite in Czechoslovakia, nickel in Cuba, and nonferrous metals in Mongolia.
