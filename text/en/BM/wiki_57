<doc id="419215" wikidata="Q3087456" url="?curid=419215" title="List of ABC television affiliates (by U.S. state)">
<text>The [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) is an American broadcast television television network owned by the Disney Media Networks subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, which originated in 1927 as the NBC Blue radio network, and five years after its 1942 divorce from NBC and purchase by Edward J. Noble (adopting its current name the following year), expanded into television in April 1948. The network currently has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current affiliation agreements with 242 other television stations.

This article is a listing of current ABC affiliates in the continental United States and U.S. possessions (including subchannel affiliates, satellite stations and select low-power translators), arranged alphabetically by state, and based on the station&#x27;s city of license, and followed in parentheses by the Designated Market Area if it differs from the city of license. There are links to and articles on each of the stations, describing their histories, local programming and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies.

The station&#x27;s advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is its virtual channel number.

Stations listed in boldface are owned and operated by ABC through its subsidiary ABC Owned Television Stations.

<doc id="419216" wikidata="Q538459" url="?curid=419216" title="Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton">
<text>Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton (28 September 1663 – 9 October 1690) was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England and his mistress Barbara Villiers. A military commander, Henry FitzRoy was appointed colonel of the Grenadier Guards in 1681 and Vice-Admiral of England from 1682 to 1689. He was killed in the storming of Cork during the Williamite–Jacobite War in 1690.

==Early life and military career==
Born to Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine, on 28 September 1663, Henry FitzRoy was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England, the second by Barbara Villiers. His mother was the daughter of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, a colonel of one of King Charles I&#x27;s regiments who was killed in action during the Civil War. On 1 August 1672, at the age of 8, marriage was arranged to the 5-year-old Isabella, daughter and heiress of Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington. A wedding ceremony took place on 4 November 1679 witnessed and recorded by John Evelyn in his diary of that date describing him as &quot;exceedingly handsome, by far surpassing any of the Kings other naturall Issue&quot;. At the time of his marriage, Henry FitzRoy was created Baron Sudbury, Viscount Ipswich, and Earl of Euston. In 1675, he was created Duke of Grafton, and Charles II made him a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1680. He was appointed colonel of the Grenadier Guards in 1681.

FitzRoy was brought up as a sailor and saw military action at the siege of Luxembourg in 1684. In that year, he received a warrant to supersede Sir Robert Holmes as Governor of the Isle of Wight, when the latter was charged with making false musters. However, Holmes was acquitted by court-martial and retained the governorship. In 1686, he killed John Talbot, brother of the Earl of Shrewsbury, in a duel; Talbot having given Grafton some &quot;unhandsome and provoking language&quot;. He was appointed Vice-Admiral of the Narrow Seas from 1685 to 1687. At King James II&#x27;s coronation, Grafton was Lord High Constable. During the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth he commanded the royal troops in Somerset. However, he later acted with John Churchill, and joined William of Orange to overthrow the King in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

==Death==
FitzRoy died in Ireland on 9 October 1690 of a wound received at the storming of Cork while leading William&#x27;s forces, aged 27. His body was returned to England for burial—with some internal organs removed and buried (in Ballintemple, Cork) to preserve his remains for transport.

In October 1697, his widow, Isabella, married Sir Thomas Hanmer, a young Flintshire baronet, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and an authority on the works of William Shakespeare. She died in 1723.

==Legacy==
The Duke of Grafton owned land in what was then countryside near Dublin, Ireland, which later became part of the city. A country lane on this land eventually developed into Grafton Street, one of Dublin&#x27;s main streets. Grafton Alley in Cork, close to where he was shot, also bears his name.

<doc id="419220" wikidata="Q762507" url="?curid=419220" title="Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland">
<text>Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, 4th Baron Percy, (29 September 160213 October 1668), was an English aristocrat, and supporter of the Parliamentary cause in the First English Civil War.

The Percys had been the leading family in Northern England for centuries, and one of the richest, a combination that made them both essential to a stable regime, and dangerous. His ancestors included Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot;, who led two rebellions, and died at Shrewsbury in 1405; his great-uncle was executed for treason in 1537, as was his uncle, the 2nd Earl of Essex, in 1601. His grandfather died in the Tower of London, where his father Henry Percy was held from 1605 to 1621. From 1569 to 1630, the Percies were barred from visiting their estates in the North.

This made his support, and that of his cousin, the 3rd Earl of Essex, an important asset for Parliament when the civil war began in 1642. His position as Lord High Admiral also helped secure the Royal Navy, a decisive factor in winning the war.

While contemporaries acknowledged this was driven by a genuine belief in constitutional monarchy, his innate caution meant he could appear unreliable. He supported peace moves in 1643, then the war party headed by Oliver Cromwell, followed by a number of changes in allegiance. The breaking point was his refusal to support the execution of Charles I in 1649. During the 1649 to 1660 Commonwealth of England, he lived on his estates.

Attempts to re-enter politics after the 1660 Restoration failed, although he held several minor positions under Charles II. He died at Petworth House in October 1668.

==Biographical details==

Algernon Percy was the third, but eldest surviving, son of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, the so-called &#x27;Wizard Earl.&#x27; His mother Dorothy was sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, executed for treason in 1601. The marriage was not a success; Henry claimed the terms of the marriage contract had not been fulfilled, and considered his wife a bad influence on his sons. In 1605, he was accused of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he remained until 1621.

His sister, Lucy Hay &quot;née&quot; Percy, dowager countess of Carlisle, and his younger brother, Henry Percy, were members of the household of Charles I&#x27;s queen, Henrietta Maria. Another sister, Dorothy, was married to Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester.

In 1629, Algernon married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury; his father considered it a bad match, allegedly because he blamed Anne&#x27;s grandfather for his imprisonment. Before her death in 1637, they had five daughters, two of whom lived to adulthood; Anne (died 1654), and Elizabeth (1636–1718), who married Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex. His second marriage to Lady Elizabeth Howard (died 1705) produced his son and heir Josceline (1644–1670).

==Career; 1615–1642==
Despite his imprisonment, Percy spent long periods with his father, who attempted to supervise and control his education, which followed the normal path for nobility of the period. from 1615 to 1618, he attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, then studied law at the Middle Temple in London. In 1618, he and his tutor, Edward Dowse, began a six-year tour of Europe, including visits to the Dutch Republic, Italy, and France.

After returning to England in 1624, he was elected MP for Sussex, then Chichester. In March 1626, he moved to the House of Lords, becoming known as &quot;Lord Percy.&quot; When his father died in 1632, he succeeded to his title.

In November 1626, he was appointed joint Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland, Westmorland, and Northumberland. Percy became a leader in the House of Lords of the faction opposed to Charles I&#x27;s favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.

===Naval career===

Throughout the early 1630s, the 10th Earl attempted to ingratiate himself with Charles I&#x27;s court, initially unsuccessfully, although his family connections in the queen&#x27;s household did manage to get him admitted to the Order of the Garter in 1635. By 1636–1637, he was in good enough standing at court to be appointed admiral of the ship money fleet. Northumberland attempted to initiate naval reforms, often bypassing the lords of the admiralty and submitting his proposals directly to Charles I and the Privy Council. Although most historians would not consider Northumberland a Puritan, he did enforce the Oath of Supremacy on his fleet and removed three Catholic officers who refused to take the oath.

Northumberland&#x27;s first expedition as admiral in 1636 was to force Dutch ships fishing in waters claimed by England to purchase English fishing licences, in exchange for which the English fleet would offer protection from the Dunkirkers. If Dutch sea captains refused to purchase the licences, their nets were cut.

Northumberland was less enthusiastic about his second expedition as admiral, which was to transport Spanish money to the Netherlands in 1637. His political faction was strongly pro-French and anti-Spanish, so he rankled at the thought of aiding the Spaniards.

====Lord High Admiral====
In 1638, two of Northumberland&#x27;s prominent supporters at court — Thomas Wentworth and Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud — used their influence at court to have him made Lord High Admiral of England, a position which had been vacant since the assassination of the 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1628. At the time he was appointed, it was understood that Charles I&#x27;s son James would become Lord High Admiral upon attaining his majority, although the Civil Wars occurred before this could happen and Charles removed Northumberland from the post in 1642.

===Events leading to the Civil Wars===
In response to the rise of the Scottish Covenanters, who opposed the attempt to introduce the Book of Common Prayer in Scotland in 1637, Charles I appointed an eight-man subcommittee of the Privy Council to deal with the issue. Northumberland&#x27;s patron, Thomas Wentworth, favoured war with Scotland, while Northumberland did not want to go to war, and feared that his estates in northern England would be occupied during the hostilities. As such, when Wentworth had Northumberland appointed general of the English forces during the second of the Bishops&#x27; Wars in January 1640, Northumberland was happy to let illness prevent him from joining the army in the field, and Northumberland was entirely defeatist about the prospect of defeating the Covenanters militarily. In May 1640, Northumberland was one of only two members of a subcommittee of the Privy Council who opposed the dissolution of the Short Parliament, a move that confirmed his break with Wentworth (whom Charles had recently named Earl of Strafford) and earned him the displeasure of the king.

When the Long Parliament met, Northumberland became one of the leading critics of royal policy. During Strafford&#x27;s trial for high treason and the subsequent bill of attainder against him, Northumberland gave evidence at his trial which, though favourable on the important point of bringing the Irish army to England, was on the whole damaging.

Northumberland&#x27;s brother Henry was involved in the First Army Plot of 1641, an attempt to rescue Strafford from the Tower of London and to forcibly dissolve the Long Parliament. Northumberland encouraged his brother to write a letter exposing the royalist plot to rescue Strafford, and then, at John Pym&#x27;s urging, agreed to allow Denzil Holles and John Hampden to publish this letter.

==The English Civil War, 1642–1649==
===Northumberland&#x27;s role in the First English Civil War, 1642–1646===
====Break with the king====
With the coming of the English Civil War, Northumberland became the highest-ranking member of Charles I&#x27;s government to side with the Parliamentarians.

His first action in open defiance of royal authority came in November 1641, when he obeyed Parliament&#x27;s instruction to prepare four ships to take men and arms under parliamentary control to Ireland to suppress the rebellion there. He did not, however, support the Grand Remonstrance. However, when James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond suggested in January 1642 that the parliament adjourn for six months, Northumberland led a protest which favoured sanctioning Richmond for breach of privilege. In February, Parliament named Northumberland Lord Lieutenant of Sussex, Pembrokeshire, and Anglesey. Northumberland subsequently voted in favour of the Militia Ordinance. During the subsequent fighting between royalist and parliamentary forces, Northumberland&#x27;s control of the navy was a crucial factor in securing parliamentary victory. As a result, Charles I removed Northumberland from the post of Lord High Admiral in late June 1642 and Northumberland relinquished the position. In July, he accepted a position on the parliamentary committee of public safety.

Northumberland&#x27;s support for the war wavered shortly thereafter, however, in the wake of setbacks faced by parliamentary forces in 1642–1643; he was also disappointed that Parliament chose Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick rather than himself as the new Lord High Admiral. He was apparently appalled by the violence of the Battle of Edgehill and the Battle of Turnham Green, and became the leader of a party favouring peace by early-to-mid-1643.

====Second marriage====
Northumberland&#x27;s first wife died of smallpox in 1637. In October 1642, he remarried, to Lady Elizabeth, daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk and thus his first wife&#x27;s cousin.

====Conversion to the peace faction====
In April 1643, Northumberland headed the parliamentary delegation to negotiate with Charles I at Oxford, but Charles was willing to grant little. Returning to London, Northumberland&#x27;s peace party was increasingly attacked by the party favouring continued war: for example, in June, he was accused of complicity in Waller&#x27;s Plot, though he was never prosecuted. In August, a leading hawk, Isaac Penington, the Lord Mayor of London instigated a plot whereby a number of lords were physically threatened, in the hopes that he would be able to have Northumberland arrested. After Northumberland was unable to convince his cousin, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to support further peace negotiations with the royalists, he retired to his estates at Petworth—unlike other &quot;peace lords&quot;, who joined the king at Oxford at this time.

====Conversion to the war party====
Northumberland did not remain at Petworth for long, though. Although he had opposed an alliance between parliament and Scotland against the king, following the passage of the Solemn League and Covenant in September 1643, Northumberland returned to the capital and took the Covenant. He was soon appointed to the newly created Committee of Both Kingdoms, serving as its first chairman. Northumberland would gain a reputation as a supporter of the Scots on the committee – many speculated that this was because Scottish forces were occupying his lands in the north. Thus, although he continued to favour negotiations with Charles I, he was quickly coming around to the war party&#x27;s position. Northumberland was one of only four lords to vote in favour of the Self-denying Ordinance. Soon, he would prove to be one of the greatest supporters of the New Model Army, with his servant Robert Scawen chairing parliament&#x27;s army committee.

In March 1645, Parliament made Northumberland guardian of Charles&#x27; two young children, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Gloucester (and also the Duke of York in July 1646), and there was talk that Northumberland might be made king if negotiations with Charles failed. Following the failure of the negotiations at Uxbridge, Northumberland was thoroughly behind the war party, now known as the Independents. In spite of Northumberland&#x27;s political conversion, he did not vote in favour of the bill of attainder against his old patron, Archbishop Laud.

===1647: Between the First and Second English Civil War===
In early 1647, Northumberland sided with Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and the Presbyterian party against the Independents as they attempted to draw up terms acceptable to the king.

In the emerging dispute between parliament and the army, Northumberland sided with the army, and in July 1647, he was one of nine peers who left Parliament for the army following riots around Westminster. Meetings were subsequently held between Northumberland and the army at his property, Syon House.

Northumberland led a final attempt to negotiate with Charles I in December 1647, but this failed.

===Role in the Regicide===
Northumberland opposed the Vote of No Addresses in January 1648 and backed the continuation of attempts to agree terms with Charles I, along with former members of the Peace Party in the House of Commons, such as Denzil Holles. Attitudes on both sides hardened following Royalist defeat in the February to August 1648 Second English Civil War and a significant section of Parliament and senior officers of the New Model Army, including Oliver Cromwell, concluded further negotiation with Charles I was pointless. In December 1648, Pride&#x27;s Purge excluded those MPs who wanted to continue talks, creating the so-called Rump Parliament which voted to put the king on trial. Northumberland led the Lords in opposing the Execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649.

==Life during the English Interregnum, 1649–1660==
Northumberland withdrew from public life following the execution of Charles I. In May 1649, he was relieved of responsibility for the king&#x27;s children and no longer had any official duties. He was briefly placed under house arrest in 1655 after John Thurloe accused him of encouraging his northern tenants to participate in the Penruddock uprising.

Northumberland refused requests from both Oliver Cromwell and Richard Cromwell to sit in the upper house of their parliaments.

==Life following the Restoration, 1660–1668==

With the coming of the Restoration in 1660, Northumberland attempted to re-enter politics by organizing the Suffolk House cabal, which included Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, Denzil Holles, Oliver St John, and William Pierrepont, and which hoped to force on Charles II the terms offered to Charles I at Newport. This cabal collapsed when General Monck chose to support the Convention Parliament in April 1660.

With Charles II&#x27;s return to England in May 1660, Northumberland rushed to curry favour with the new king. He did however oppose the bill to execute the regicides responsible for Charles I&#x27;s death.

Charles II appointed Northumberland to his Privy Council in late May 1660, and he was named Lord Lieutenant of Sussex in August and Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland in September. His return to politics was completed with his service as Lord High Constable of England at Charles II&#x27;s coronation in April 1661. Northumberland gained a reputation as a diligent enforcer of the Clarendon Code and as an efficient organizer of the militias.

During the period of Restoration politics, Northumberland&#x27;s closest ally at court was Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, while Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon remained a constant enemy, a rivalry which climaxed with Northumberland voting in favour of Clarendon&#x27;s impeachment in 1667.

Northumberland died at Petworth on 13 October 1668 and was buried there in September 1668. His son Josceline succeeded him as 11th Earl of Northumberland.

<text>Robert Ezra Park (February 14, 1864 – February 7, 1944) was an American urban sociologist who is considered to be one of the most influential figures in early U.S. sociology. Park was a pioneer in the field of sociology, changing it from a passive philosophical discipline to an active discipline rooted in the study of human behavior. He made significant contributions to the study of urban communities, race relations and the development of empirically grounded research methods, most notably participant observation in the field of criminology. From 1905 to 1914, Park worked with Booker T. Washington at the Tuskegee Institute. After Tuskegee, he taught at the University of Chicago from 1914 to 1933, where he played a leading role in the development of the Chicago School of sociology.

Park is noted for his work in human ecology, race relations, human migration, cultural assimilation, social movements, and social disorganization He played a large role in defining sociology as a natural science and challenged the belief that sociology is a moral science. He saw sociology as &quot;...a point of view and a method for investigating the processes by which individuals are inducted into and induced to cooperate in some sort of permanent corporate existence, society.&quot;

== Biography ==
=== Childhood and early life ===
Robert E. Park was born in Harveyville, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, on February 14, 1864, to parents Hiram Asa Park and Theodosia Warner Park. Immediately following his birth, the Park family moved to Red Wing, Minnesota, where he grew up.

Park lived in Red Wing for his first eighteen years. Given the pseudonym &quot;Middle Border&quot; by American novelist Hamlin Garland, Red Wing was a small town of immigrants and Mdewakanton on the bluffs and in the valley along the northern Mississippi River. The rural area is fertile, and Minnesota serves as a corporate outpost for East Coast colonial investment in the American West; Park&#x27;s hometown was connected to the Twin Cities nearby to the north and Chicago to the east by barge, riverboat, and railroad. Suggesting something of a criminology credential, Park later recalled an encounter with bandit Jesse James, who young Park provided with directions to a local blacksmith&#x27;s shop. Park has been described as an &quot;awkward, sentimental and romantic boy&quot; whose character led him to develop an interest in writing. He was not considered a promising student, but he liked learning about the people in his town and their ancestries, a niche which would prove to be useful throughout his life. Park graduated high school in 1882, finishing tenth overall in a class of thirteen. Park was interested in attending college after high school, but his father did not consider his son &quot;study material&quot; and did not support the boy&#x27;s plan. As a result, Robert ran away from home and found a job working on a railroad.

Park&#x27;s love of writing and concern for social issues, especially issues related to race in cities, led him to become a journalist. Franklin Ford and Park made plans for a newspaper, &quot;Thought News&quot;, which would report public opinion. Although it was never published, Park still pursued a career as a journalist. From 1887 to 1898, Park worked as a journalist in Detroit, Denver, New York City, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Park&#x27;s experience as a reporter led him to study the social function of the newspaper, &quot;not as an organ of opinion, but as a record of current events&quot;. Towards the end of his newspaper career, Park became disenchanted with the idea that newspaper reporting could alone solved social issues. As a reporter Park learned a great deal about urban communities, which inspired his later sociological endeavors in race relations.

In 1894, Park married Clara Cahill, the daughter of a wealthy Michigan family and had four children: Edward, Theodosia, Margaret and Robert.

=== Education ===
Park first attended the University of Minnesota where he excelled in his courses. Because of his success at the University of Minnesota, his father offered to invest in furthering Robert&#x27;s education at the prestigious University of Michigan. Upon entering the University of Michigan, Park decided to transition from studying science to instead studying philology. His professor Calvin Thomas exerted a great influence on him. He challenged him to expand his mind and deeply pursue the concepts presented in his courses.

John Dewey also had a very strong influence on Park during his college year. After Park took Dewey&#x27;s course on logic his sophomore year of college, he decided to again shift his major, this time to philosophy. Park stated that his interest in going to college has originally been purely practical, originally intending to pursue engineering, but this mindset shifted when he began taking courses which truly intrigued him. He was endlessly fascinated by the notion of exploring the realm of the dubious and unknown rather than focusing on the secure knowledge offered to him in his previous years of education. Upon becoming a student of philosophy Park became, &quot;presently possessed with a devouring curiosity to know more about the world and all that men had thought and done&quot;. His future work in the field of sociology, which primary focused on human&#x27;s behavior in different environments, proves that this exploratory mindset stuck with him for the rest of his life.

At the University of Michigan Park was involved in the school newspaper, &quot;The Argonaut.&quot; He held a position of associate editor his junior year and managing editor his senior year. He wrote a satirical piece titled, &quot;A Misapprehension, A Realistic Tale à la Henry James&quot;. The connections he formed at &quot;The Argonaut&quot; would prove helpful in later landing him a job as a reporter at Minneapolis newspaper.

Park graduated from the University of Michigan (Phi Beta Kappa) in 1887 and attended Harvard University. He earned an MA from Harvard in 1899. After graduating, he went to Germany to study at Friedrich Wilhelm University. He studied Philosophy and Sociology in 1899–1900 with Georg Simmel in Berlin. The three courses Park took with Simmel constituted the majority of his sociological training and Park proceeded to adopt Simmel&#x27;s belief that modernity would express itself most tangibly in the city. Simmel&#x27;s work the &quot;Philosophy of Money&quot; and relative shorter essays greatly influenced Park&#x27;s future writing. In Berlin, Park read a book on the logics of social sciences by Russian author Bogdan A. Kistyakovski, who studied under philosopher Wilhelm Windelband. It was this reading that inspired Park to spend a semester at the University of Strasbourg (1900), and then undergo his PhD in philosophy in 1903 in Heidelberg under Wilhelm Windelband and Alfred Hettner with a dissertation titled &quot;Masse und Publikum. Eine methodologische und soziologische Untersuchung,&quot; which translates to&quot;:&quot; &quot;Crowd and Public: A methodological and sociological study.&quot; Park then traveled to Germany to study at the University of Berlin. He enrolled for one semester at the University of Strasbourg, and studied for a few years at the University of Heidelberg alongside Georg Simmel, earning his PhD in 1904.

=== Professional life ===

==== Journalism ====
Park began his career with journaling in Minneapolis in 1887. Between then and 1898, he worked with newspapers in Detroit, Denver, New York, and Chicago until attending Harvard in 1898. He believed that his work for newspapers could encourage moral and social change through public outrage. He worked in various journalistic capacities, such as being a police reporter, general reporter, and feature writer and city newspaper editor and wrote muckraking stories and investigative pieces and articles that called for techniques of &quot;scientific reporting,&quot; which he later realized was similar to survey research. Park&#x27;s main focus as a journalist was the daily life of human beings and their routines. His focus was what journalists call &quot;human interest&quot;. His experience as a journalist impacted his view on the world and how people should study it. Although he was a journalist for many years he was not totally satisfied with just reporting current events. Park wanted to dive deeper than the surface of these events and understand the underlying long-term significance of the events.

==== Teaching ====
In 1904, Park began teaching philosophy at Harvard as an assistant professor. Park taught there for two years until celebrated educator and author, Booker T. Washington, invited him to the Tuskegee Institute to work on racial issues in the southern United States. Park was offered a position by the Congo Reform Association, but ended up subsequently working for Washington at Tuskegee. Park and Washington originally met through their mutual interest in helping Africans through the Congo Reform Association of which Park was secretary and Washington was vice president. Over the next seven years, Park worked for Washington by doing field research and taking courses. In 1910, Park traveled to Europe to compare US poverty to European poverty. Shortly after the trip, Washington, with the help of Park, published &quot;The Man Farthest Down&quot; (1913). This publication highlights Parker and Washington&#x27;s journey to explore Europe in the hopes of finding the man &quot;the farthest down&quot; in order to explore these people were choosing to emigrate and the likeliness of a future change in positions. This led them on a six-week journey through the British Isles, France, Italy, Poland, Denmark, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

After the Tuskegee Institute, Park joined the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago in 1914, first as a lecturer (until 1923), then as a full professor until his retirement in 1933. During his time in Chicago, he continued to study and teach human ecology and race relations. In 1914, Park taught his first course in the Sociology and Anthropology department. The course was titled &quot;The Negro in America&quot; and it was, &quot;Directed especially to the effects, in slavery and freedom, of the white and black race, an attempt will be made to characterize the nature of the present tensions and tendencies and to estimate the character of the changes which race relations are likely to bring about in the American system&quot;. This class was important from a historical perspective because it may have been the first course ever offered at a predominantly white institution that focused exclusively on black Americans. This set a precedent for classes with similar focuses to come.

==== Legacy ====
During Park&#x27;s time at the University of Chicago, its sociology department began to use the city that surrounded it as a sort of research laboratory. His work, together with that of his Chicago colleagues, such as Ernest Burgess, Homer Hoyt, and Louis Wirth – developed into an approach to urban sociology that became known as the Chicago School. This would become Park&#x27;s legacy.

After leaving the University of Chicago, Park moved to Nashville, Tennessee. He taught at Fisk University until his death in 1944, at age 79.

During his lifetime, Park became a well-known figure both within and outside the academic world. At various times from 1925, he was president of the American Sociological Association and of the Chicago Urban League, and he was a member of the Social Science Research Council. Park&#x27;s presidential address for the American Sociological Association was entitled &quot;The Concept of Position in Sociology&quot; and was later published in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the 1925 Annual Meeting.

== Work ==
=== Human ecology ===
Park coined the term human ecology, the study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. The term has been described as an attempt to apply the interrelations of human beings a type of analysis previously applied to the interrelations of plants and animals. Park himself explains human ecology as, &quot;fundamentally an attempt to investigate the processes by which the biotic balance and social equilibrium are disturbed, the transition is made from one relatively stable order to other&quot;. Bogardus acknowledges that Park is the father of human ecology, proclaiming, &quot;Not only did he coin the name but he laid out the patterns, offered the earliest exhibit of ecological concepts, defined the major ecological processes and stimulated more advanced students to cultivate the fields of research in ecology than most other sociologists combined.&quot;

Park found that a key underpinning of his human ecology is the concept of competition. He believed that it is the primary feature of the biotic level of life. He maintained that human beings restricted in some areas when it comes to competition, while in the plant and animal kingdom it is uninhibited. He maintained that human restriction of competition is what allows our modern concept of society to exist. The essential characteristics of competition are 1) a territorially organized population 2) that is more or less completely rooted in the soil it occupies 3) the individual units living in a relationship are living in a mutually dependent relationship, not a symbiotic one. According to Park&#x27;s papers regarding this topic, &quot;Dominance&quot; and &quot;Succession: An Ecological Concept&quot;, ecological competition can be manifest itself through dominance and succession.

=== Urban ecology ===
While at the University of Chicago, Park continued to strengthen his theory of human ecology. Along with Ernest W. Burgess developed a program of urban research in the sociology department. They also developed a theory of urban ecology, which first appeared in their book &quot;Introduction to the Science of Sociology&quot; (1922). Using the city of Chicago as their model they proposed that cities were environments like those found in nature. Park and Burgess suggested that cities were governed by many of the same forces of Darwinian evolution that happens in ecosystems. They felt the most significant force was competition. Competition was created by groups fighting for urban resources, like land, which led to a division of urban space into ecological niches. Within these niches people shared similar social characteristics because they were subject to the same ecological pressure.

Competition for land and resources within cities eventually leads to separation of urban space into zones with the more desirable zones imposing higher rent. As residents of a city become more affluent, they move outward from the city center. Park and Burgess refer to this a succession, a term also used in plant ecology. They predicted that cities would form into five concentric rings with areas of social and physical deterioration concentrated in the center and prosperous areas near the city&#x27;s edge. This model is known as concentric zone theory, it was first published in &quot;The City&quot; (1925).

=== Race relations ===
Park spent a great deal of time studying race relations with Booker T. Washington while at the University of Chicago. Park contributed significantly to the study of race relations, with Everrett Hughes stating that, &quot;Park probably contributed more ideas for analysis of racial relations and cultural contracts than any other modern social scientist.&quot;

Park worked closely with Booker T. Washington and the Tuskegee Institute from 1907 to 1914. While working under Washington, Park&#x27;s primary interest was the system that had evolved to define Black-White relations in the South. Park said that he learned more about human nature and society while in the South. He says that, &quot;These seven years were for me a sort of prolonged internship during which I gained a clinical and first hand knowledge of a first class social problem . . .[It was from Washington that] I gained some adequate notion of how deep-rooted in human history and human nature social institutions were, and how difficult, if not impossible it was, to make fundamental changes in them by mere legislation or by legal artifice of any sort&quot;.

After leaving the Tuskegee Institute, Park joined the University of Chicago where he developed a theory of assimilation, as it pertained to immigrants in the United States, known as the &quot;race relation cycle&quot;. The cycle has four stages: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. The first step is contact followed by competition. Then, after some time, a hierarchical arrangement can prevail – one of accommodation – in which one race was dominant and others dominated. In the end assimilation occurred. Park declared that it is &quot;a cycle of events which tends everywhere to repeat itself&quot; and that it can also be seen in other social processes.&quot; He was instrumental in founding the race relations course at Chicago.

=== Critiques ===

Park&#x27;s theory of conflict has been discredited for a number of reasons, and his theories and contributions in sociology have largely been neglected and forgotten over time.

In the years following the heyday of the Chicago school, Park&#x27;s reputation took a downfall, and his idea of &quot;symbolic interactionism&quot; was subsequently pushed aside. Park was frequently called a conservative when it came to his theory of the race relations cycle. Critics of Park misinterpreted his theory of race relations, believing that Park meant to assert that progression through the four stages was inevitable; current discourse debates whether Park meant anything of the sort. Within Park&#x27;s theory of conflict, race relations exists merely as a specific case of this greater theory. Racial groups, or any other kind of group can remain in the conflict stage indefinitely.

Park was further criticized for perceived racist tendencies. Already in his work as an editorial secretary of the Congo Reform Association, Park defended the idea of a noble white civilizing mission to elevate an allegedly savage African population. During his years at the Tuskegee Institute, this nostalgia for European imperialism was complemented by a stereotypical depiction of black peasants in the South as a primitive counterpart of the negative tendencies Park identified in modern city life. These early views on imperialism and race have been called a form of &quot;romantic racism&quot; that strongly influenced his later more elaborated sociological perspectives on the same issues. As already the black Marxist Oliver C. Cox, a student of Park, has warned, this racial essentialism eventually led Park to a mystification of race relations in the Jim Crow era as a natural solution to racial conflict.

In his essay &quot;Education in its relation to the conflict and fusion of cultures&quot;, Park can be quoted: The Negro is, by natural disposition, neither an intel-lectual nor an idealist, like the Jew; nor a brooding introspective, like the East African; nor a pioneer and frontiersman, like the Anglo-Saxon. He is primarily an artist, loving of life for its sake. His métier is expression rather than action. He is, so to speak the lady among the races.

Park&#x27;s belief in inherited racial temperaments, though racist, was somewhat offset by his belief in &quot;social inheritance&quot; working in tandem with &quot;biological inheritance&quot;. Put simply, he thought that while some races are more predisposed to certain temperaments, a whole person is also made up of their social qualities. Park also supported Franz Boas&#x27; conclusion that there was no scientific evidence to indicate that &quot;Blacks were as a group intellectually inferior to Whites&quot;.

The works of sociologists Louis Wirth and Rose Hum Lee illustrate the downfalls of Park&#x27;s thinking, specifically in relation to adhering to his views on ethnic groups in America. Park&#x27;s conclusions that the complete assimilation of Jews, Christians, and Chinese folks have occurred was shown within Wirth and Hum Lee&#x27;s work to be untrue.

== Impact ==
Park&#x27;s impact on the field of sociology is palpable yet often goes unrecognized. The majority of the sociologists born in the nineteenth century borrowed and concentrated in other fields and their work was considered sociological after the fact. Park was one such sociologist, with much of his interests originating in philosophy and then evolving into what we consider to be modern sociology when he began to focus on studying Chicago. His work led to the development of the Chicago school in sociology. Park along with fellow Chicago School sociologists Ernest Burgess, William I. Thomas, George Herbert Mead, and Louis Wirth created a theoretical basis for sociology which emphasized the more methodological approach which we recognize today. The school produced many studies on city life, including ones on Polish immigrants, gangs, and Jewish ghetto life. It has been noted that Park and his students employed a &#x27;moving camera&#x27; approach to their studies of urban life, attempting to capture city dwellers in their natural modes of life. The Chicago school of thought regarding urban ecology still guides much of the work conducted in this field today. Additionally, Erving Goffman, who is considered to be the most influential sociologist of the twenty-first century, embraced the legacy of Park by adopting more qualitative methods when constructing predictive empirical science in contrast to positivist sociological trends.

<doc id="419223" wikidata="Q266012" url="?curid=419223" title="Nebula Award for Best Novel">
<text>The Nebula Award for Best Novel is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy novels. A work of fiction is considered a novel by the organization if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths, in the categories of short story, novelette, and novella. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration, a novel must have been published in English in the US. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible, provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The award has been given annually since 1966. Novels which were expanded forms of previously published stories are eligible, and novellas published individually can be considered as novels if the author requests it. The award has been described as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot; and &quot;the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent&quot; of the Emmy Awards.

Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors nominated do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.

Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format, and nominated works must have been published during that calendar year. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as being one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be &quot;nominated&quot; in the calendar year after their publication, and then be &quot;awarded&quot; in the calendar year after that. Under the previous process, works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work if they felt it was overlooked.

During the 59 nomination years, 202 authors have had works nominated, and 46 of these have won (including co-authors and ties). Ursula K. Le Guin has received the most Nebula Awards for Best Novel, with four wins out of six nominations. Joe Haldeman has received the next most: three awards out of four nominations, while nine other authors have each won twice. Jack McDevitt has the most nominations at twelve (with one win), while Poul Anderson and Philip K. Dick tie for having the most nominations without winning an award, at five each.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="419224" wikidata="Q6143797" url="?curid=419224" title="James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe">
<text>Colonel James Archibald Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 1st Baron Wharncliffe, PC (6 October 1776 – 19 December 1845) was a British soldier and politician. A grandson of Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, he held office under Sir Robert Peel as Lord Privy Seal between 1834 and 1835 and as Lord President of the Council between 1841 and 1845.

==Background and education==
Stuart-Wortley was the son of Colonel James Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, son of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and his wife Mary Wortley-Montagu, Baroness Mountstuart in her own right, daughter of Edward Wortley Montagu and Lady Mary Pierrepont. His father had assumed the additional surname of Wortley as heir to his mother, taking later also that of Mackenzie (which his son in later life discarded) as heir to his great-uncle James Stuart-Mackenzie of Rosehaugh. Stuart-Wortley&#x27;s mother was Margaret, daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir David Cunynghame, 3rd Baronet. He was educated at Charterhouse School.

==Military career==
Stuart-Wortley was commissioned into the 48th Foot in 1790, transferred to the 7th Foot in 1791, and purchased a captaincy in the 72nd Foot in 1793. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1797 and became colonel of the 12th Foot six months later. In 1797 he transferred to the Grenadier Guards, but resigned his commission in 1801.

==Political career==
Stuart-Wortley sat as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Bossiney in Cornwall between 1802 and 1818, when he was returned for Yorkshire. 

His attitude on various questions became gradually more liberal, and his support of Catholic Emancipation lost him his seat in 1826. He was then raised to the peerage as Baron Wharncliffe, of Wortley in the County of York, a recognition both of his previous parliamentary activity and of his high position among the country gentlemen.

In 1831, as political tempers ran high over the issue of Reform, Wharncliffe succeeded in opening channels of communication between the Government and the Opposition. Greville noted in his diary on 19 November 1831 that:”Wharncliffe has neither wealth, influence, nor superior abilities, nor even popularity with his own party. He is a spirited, sensible, zealous, honorable, consistent country gentleman; their knowledge of his moderation and integrity induced Ministers to commit themselves to him, and he will thus be in all probability enabled to render an essential service to his country…” 

He at first opposed the 1832 Reform Bill but, having come to see the undesirability of a popular conflict, separated himself from the Tories (with a number of colleagues, collectively known as &quot;the Waverers&quot;) and took an important part in modifying the attitude of the peers and helping to pass the bill, though his attempts at amendment only resulted in his pleasing neither party. He became Lord Privy Seal in Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s short 1834 to 1835 ministry, and again joined him in 1841 as Lord President of the Council, a post he held until 1845. 

In 1834, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

In 1837 Lord Wharncliffe brought out an edition of the writings of his ancestress, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.

The 1833 steam locomotive, &quot;Lord Wharncliffe&quot;, was named after him; it ran on the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, of which he was a director.

==Family==
Lord Wharncliffe married Lady Elizabeth Caroline Mary Crichton (1779–1856), daughter of John Crichton, 1st Earl Erne and his second wife Lady Mary Hervey on 30 March 1799. They had five children:

*John Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 2nd Baron Wharncliffe (1801–1855)
*Hon. Charles Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie (1802–1844)
*Hon. Caroline Mary Stuart-Wortley (1803–1806) 
*Hon. James Archibald Stuart-Wortley (1805–1881), Solicitor-General
*Hon. Caroline Jane Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie (1809–12 June 1876), married on 30 August 1830 Hon. John Chetwynd-Talbot (1806–1852)

Lord Wharncliffe died in December 1845, aged 69, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son, John, whose son Edward, 3rd Baron was created Earl of Wharncliffe in 1876. Lady Wharncliffe died in April 1856.

<doc id="419225" wikidata="Q1086189" url="?curid=419225" title="Nebula Award for Best Novella">
<text>The Nebula Award for Best Novella is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy novellas. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novella if it is between 17,500 and 40,000 words; awards are also given out for pieces of longer lengths in the novel category, and for shorter lengths in the short story and novelette categories. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration, a novella must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible, provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The Nebula Award for Best Novella has been awarded annually since 1966. Novellas published by themselves are eligible for the novel award instead, if the author requests them to be considered as such. The award has been described as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot; and &quot;the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent&quot; of the Emmy Awards.

Nebula Award nominees and winners are selected by members of SFWA, although the authors of the nominees are not required to be members themselves. Each year, works are nominated by SFWA members during a period typically spanning from December 15 to January 31. The six works receiving the most nominations proceed to the final ballot, with additional nominees considered in the event of ties. Subsequently, members have about a month to vote on the final ballot, and the winners are announced at the Nebula Awards ceremony held in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. The rules were changed to their current format in 2009. Previously, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.

During the 59 nomination years, 201 authors have had works nominated; 56 of these have won, including co-authors and ties. Nancy Kress has won the most awards: four out of eight nominations. Robert Silverberg, John Varley, and Roger Zelazny have each won twice out of eight, two, and three nominations, respectively. Silverberg&#x27;s and Kress&#x27;s eight nominations are the most of any authors, followed by Lucius Shepard and Michael Bishop at seven, and Kate Wilhelm and Avram Davidson with six. Bishop has the most nominations without receiving an award for novellas, though Wilhelm and Davidson have also not won an award.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novella was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<text>The Lindsay String Quartet (or The Lindsays) was a British string quartet from 1965 to 2005.

==History==
The quartet first performed at the Royal Academy of Music in 1965 to compete for a prize and set out to make the string quartets of Bartók and Beethoven the centre of their repertoire. In 1967, the quartet was appointed to be Leverhulme Scholars at Keele University, and in 1970, it changed its name from the Cropper to the Lindsay String Quartet, naming itself after Lord Lindsay, the founder of Keele University. 1971 brought a change in second violin to Ronald Birks. The quartet gained a Gramophone Award for the Late Beethoven Quartets in 1984. Roger Bigley left the quartet in 1985 to be replaced by Robin Ireland. Bigley then became assistant principal viola of the BBC Philharmonic orchestra before becoming assistant head of strings at the RNCM.

In 1974, they became Quartet-in-Residence at Sheffield University and five years later held a similar position at Manchester University, where they performed a regular concert season, directed seminars, and coached chamber ensembles. The quartet presented festivals each year at the Studio Theatre in the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, which featured many famous local and international musicians, and travelled widely throughout the world.

In 2005, after 39 years, the quartet announced their intended retirement the following year. They then performed a successful series of farewell concerts throughout the world, culminating in four final concerts in their home town of Sheffield in July 2005. Individual members afterwards pursued separate musical ideas.

The quartet produced an extensive list of recordings, including an acclaimed Beethoven cycle, and substantial parts of the Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Dvořák repertoires.

In 2019, a book titled &quot;A Quintessential Quartet: The Story of the Lindsay String Quartet&quot; was written by Bernard Gregor-Smith, one of the founding members.

Leader Peter Cropper (19 November 1945 – 29 May 2015) was the founding artistic director of Music in the Round, a charitable organisation he founded in the 1980s, that promotes chamber music concerts in Sheffield and nationally. The Lindsays formed the core of Music in the Round&#x27;s activity for over twenty years, until their retirement. Cropper died suddenly in 2015 aged 69.

<text>Flash Airlines was a private charter airline operating out of Cairo, Egypt that was part of the Flash Group tourism company. The airline operated two Boeing 737-3Q8 aircraft manufactured in 1993 on non-scheduled commercial passenger flights on both international and domestic routes.

==History==

The airline was established in 1995 as Heliopolis Airlines. It received its certificate of operation from the Egyptian authorities in 1996. It became a member of the Flash group in 2000. During that year Flash Airlines had one 737-300 with another that joined in 2002.

In 2002, Swiss aviation authorities performed a surprise inspection on SU-ZCF, a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300. They discovered missing pilot oxygen masks, a lack of oxygen tanks, and inoperable cockpit instruments. The Swiss grounded the aircraft until Flash repaired the plane. Several days later, Switzerland banned Flash. Poland also banned Flash, while tour operators in Norway ceased contracting. In early 2004, SU-ZCF crashed while operating Flash&#x27;s Flight 604 from Sharm el-Sheikh to Paris via Cairo. The subsequent investigation exposed poor safety measures and pilot disorientation, which led to the demise of Flash.

==Fleet==

The Flash Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft during operations:

The Heliopolis Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft before merging into Flash group:

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 3 January 2004, Flash Airlines Flight 604, operated by a Boeing 737-300 registration SU-ZCF, crashed into the Red Sea shortly after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh. All passengers and crew died. As a result of the crash, Flash Airlines went out of business in March 2004.

<doc id="419231" wikidata="Q3066599" url="?curid=419231" title="John Kessel">
<text>John Joseph Vincent Kessel (born September 24, 1950) is an American author of science fiction and fantasy. He is a prolific short story writer, and the author of four solo novels, &quot;Good News From Outer Space&quot; (1989), &quot;Corrupting Dr. Nice&quot; (1997), &quot;The Moon and the Other&quot; (2017), and &quot;Pride and Prometheus&quot; (2018), and one novel, &quot;Freedom Beach&quot; (1985) in collaboration with his friend James Patrick Kelly. Kessel is married to author Therese Anne Fowler.

==Education==

Kessel obtained a B.A. in Physics and English from the University of Rochester in 1972, followed by a M.A. in English from University of Kansas in 1974, and a Ph.D. in English from the University of Kansas in 1981, where he studied under science fiction writer and scholar James Gunn. Since 1982 Kessel has taught classes in American literature, science fiction, fantasy, and fiction writing at North Carolina State University, and helped organize the MFA Creative Writing program at NCSU, serving as its first director.

==Publications==

Kessel won a Nebula Award in 1982 for his novella &quot;Another Orphan&quot;, in which the protagonist finds himself living inside the novel &quot;Moby-Dick.&quot; His short story &quot;Buffalo&quot; won the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award and the Locus poll in 1992. He won a second Nebula Award for his 2008 novelette &quot;Pride and Prometheus,&quot; a melding the tales of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The intervening 26 years between his two Nebula Awards was the longest gap between competitive awards in Nebula history. The novelette also won a 2009 Shirley Jackson Award, and was expanded into a novel by the same name in 2018. 

His novella &quot;Stories for Men&quot; shared the 2002 James Tiptree Jr. Award (Otherwise Award) for science fiction dealing with gender issues with M. John Harrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Light&quot;. He has been nominated three times for a World Fantasy Award: 1993 for the &quot;Meeting in Infinity&quot; collection, 1999 for the short fiction &quot;Every Angel is Terrifying&quot;, and 2009 for the short story &quot;Pride and Prometheus&quot;.

Kessel is also a widely published science fiction and fantasy critic. His works of criticism include the 2004 essay on Orson Scott Card&#x27;s novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, &quot;Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender&#x27;s Game, Intention, and Morality&quot;. With Mark L. Van Name, Kessel created the Sycamore Hill Writer&#x27;s Workshop. Kessel has also edited, with James Patrick Kelly, three collections of contemporary sf short stories, &quot;Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology&quot;, &quot;Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology&quot;, and &quot;The Secret History of Science Fiction&quot;.

In 1994 his play &quot;Faustfeathers&quot; received the Paul Green Playwrights&#x27; Prize. In 2007 his story &quot;A Clean Escape&quot; (previously adapted by Kessel as a one-act play in 1986) was adapted by Sam Egan for ABC&#x27;s science fiction anthology series &quot;Masters of Science Fiction&quot;.

<text>RTLinux is a hard realtime real-time operating system (RTOS) microkernel that runs the entire Linux operating system as a fully preemptive process. The hard real-time property makes it possible to control robots, data acquisition systems, manufacturing plants, and other time-sensitive instruments and machines from RTLinux applications. The design was patented. Despite the similar name, it is not related to the Real-Time Linux project of the Linux Foundation.

RTLinux was developed by Victor Yodaiken, Michael Barabanov, Cort Dougan and others at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and then as a commercial product at FSMLabs. Wind River Systems acquired FSMLabs embedded technology in February 2007 and made a version available as Wind River Real-Time Core for Wind River Linux. As of August 2011, Wind River has discontinued the Wind River Real-Time Core product line, effectively ending commercial support for the RTLinux product.

== Background ==
The key RTLinux design objective was to add hard real-time capabilities to a commodity operating system to facilitate the development of complex control programs with both capabilities. For example, one might want to develop a real-time motor controller that used a commodity database and exported a web operator interface. Instead of attempting to build a single operating system that could support real-time and non-real-time capabilities, RTLinux was designed to share a computing device between a real-time and non-real-time operating system so that (1) the real-time operating system could never be blocked from execution by the non-real-time operating system and (2) components running in the two different environments could easily share data. As the name implies RTLinux was originally designed to use Linux as the non-real-time system but it eventually evolved so that the RTCore real-time kernel could run with either Linux or Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix.

Multi-Environment Real-Time (MERT) was the first example of a real-time operating system coexisting with a Unix system. MERT relied on traditional virtualization techniques: the real-time kernel was the &quot;host&quot; operating system (or hypervisor) and Bell Systems Unix was the &quot;guest&quot;. RTLinux was an attempt to update the MERT concept to the PC era and commodity hardware. It was also an attempt to also overcome the performance limits of MERT, particularly the overhead introduced by virtualization.

Instead of encapsulating the guest OS in a virtual machine, RTLinux virtualized only the guest interrupt control. This method allowed the real-time kernel to convert the guest operating system into a system that was completely preemptible but that could still directly control, for example, storage devices. In particular, standard drivers for the guest worked without source modification although they needed to be recompiled to use the virtualization &quot;hooks&quot;. See also paravirtualization. The Unix &quot;pipe&quot; was adapted to permit real-time and non-real-time programs to communicate, although other methods such as shared memory were also added.

From the programmer&#x27;s point of view, RTLinux originally looked like a small threaded environment for real-time tasks plus the standard Linux environment for everything else. The real-time operating system was implemented as a loadable kernel module which began by virtualizing guest interrupt control and then started a real-time scheduler. Tasks were assigned static priorities and scheduling was originally purely priority driven. The guest operating system was incorporated as the lowest priority task and essentially acted as the idle task for the real-time system. Real-time tasks ran in kernel mode. Later development of RTLinux adopted the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) POSIX threads application programming interface (API) and then permitted creation of threads in user mode with real-time threads running inside guest processes. In multiprocessor environments threads were locked to processor cores and it was possible to prevent the guest thread from running on designated core (effectively reserving cores for only real-time processing).

== Implementation ==
RTLinux provides the ability to run special real-time tasks and interrupt handlers on the same machine as standard Linux. These tasks and handlers execute when they need to execute no matter what Linux is doing. The worst case time between the moment a hardware interrupt is detected by the processor and the moment an interrupt handler starts to execute is under 15 microseconds on RTLinux running on a generic x86 (circa 2000). A RTLinux periodic task runs within 35 microseconds of its scheduled time on the same hardware. These times are hardware limited, and as hardware improves RTLinux will also improve. Standard Linux has excellent average performance and can even provide millisecond level scheduling precision for tasks using the POSIX soft real-time capabilities. Standard Linux is not, however, designed to provide sub-millisecond precision and reliable timing guarantees. RTLinux was based on a lightweight virtual machine where the Linux &quot;guest&quot; was given a virtualized interrupt controller and timer, and all other hardware access was direct. From the point of view of the real-time &quot;host&quot;, the Linux kernel is a thread. Interrupts needed for deterministic processing are processed by the real-time core, while other interrupts are forwarded to Linux, which runs at a lower priority than real-time threads. Linux drivers handled almost all I/O. First-In-First-Out pipes (FIFO) or shared memory can be used to share data between the operating system and RTLinux.

== Objective ==
The key RTLinux design objective is that the system should be transparent, modular, and extensible . Transparency means that there are no unopenable black boxes and the cost of any operation should be determinable. Modularity means that it is possible to omit functionality and the expense of that functionality if it is not needed. And extensibility means that programmers should be able to add modules and tailor the system to their requirements. The base RTLinux system supports high speed interrupt handling and no more. It has simple priority scheduler that can be easily replaced by schedulers more suited to the needs of some specific application. When developing RTLinux, it was designed to maximize the advantage we get from having Linux and its powerful capabilities available.

== Core components ==
RTLinux is structured as a small core component and a set of optional components. The core component permits installation of very low latency interrupt handlers that cannot be delayed or preempted by Linux itself and some low level synchronization and interrupt control routines. This core component has been extended to support SMP and at the same time it has been simplified by removing some functionality that can be provided outside the core.

== Functions ==
Most RTLinux functions are in a set of loadable kernel modules that provide optional services and levels of abstraction. These modules include:

# rtl sched - a priority scheduler that supports both a &quot;lite POSIX&quot; interface described below and the original V1 RTLinux API.
# rtl time - which controls the processor clocks and exports an abstract interface for connecting handlers to clocks.
# rtl posixio - supports POSIX style read/write/open interface to device drivers.
# rtl fifo - connects RT tasks and interrupt handlers to Linux processes through a device layer so that Linux processes can read/write to RT components.
# semaphore - a contributed package by Jerry Epplin which gives RT tasks blocking semaphores.
# POSIX mutex support is planned to be available in the next minor version update of RTLinux.
# mbuff is a contributed package written by Tomasz Motylewski for providing shared memory between RT components and Linux processes.

== Realtime tasks ==
RTLinux realtime tasks get implemented as kernel modules similar to the type of module that Linux uses for drivers, file systems, and so on. Realtime tasks have direct access to the hardware and do not use virtual memory. On initialization, a realtime task (module) informs the RTLinux kernel of its deadline, period, and release-time constraints.

== Threads ==
RT-Linux implements a POSIX API for a thread&#x27;s manipulation. A thread is created by calling the codice_1 function. The third parameter of codice_1 is a function which contains the code executed by the thread.

It is necessary to set thread priorities in RTLinux. Threads with higher priorities can preempt threads with lower priorities. For example, we can have a thread controlling a stepper motor. In order to move the motor fluently, it is necessary to start this thread in strictly regular intervals. This can be guaranteed by assigning a high priority to this thread. The example threads2.c sets different thread priorities. Setting of thread priority is done by code shown below:
int init_module(void)
 pthread_attr_t attr;
 struct sched_param param;
 pthread_attr_init(&amp;attr);
 param.sched_priority = 1;
 pthread_attr_setschedparam(&amp;attr, &amp;param);
 pthread_create(&amp;t1, &amp;attr, &amp;thread_code, &quot;this is thread 1&quot;);
 rtl_printf(&quot;Thread 1 started\n&quot;);
}
The output the program is as follows.

The thread 2 has the highest priority and the thread 3 has the lowest priority. The first message is printed by the middle priority thread 1 because it is started a short time before the thread 2.

<text>Thomas Johnston (2 November 1881 – 5 September 1965) was a prominent Scottish socialist journalist who became a politician of the early 20th century, a member of the Labour Party, a member of parliament (MP) and government minister – usually with Cabinet responsibility for Scottish affairs. He was also a notable figure in the Friendly society movement in Scotland.

==Red Clydesider==
Johnston was the son of David Johnston, a grocer, and his wife, Mary Blackwood.

He was born in Kirkintilloch in 1881 and educated at Kirkintilloch Board School then at Lenzie Academy. Studying Moral Philosophy and Political Economy at the University of Glasgow, he failed to graduate, but helped launch the left-wing journal, &quot;Forward&quot;, in 1906, and in the same city later became associated with the &#x27;Red Clydesiders&#x27;, a socialist grouping that included James Maxton and Manny Shinwell. In 1909 he published a book, &quot;Our Scots Noble Families&quot;, which aimed to discredit the landed aristocracy.

First elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Stirling and Clackmannan West in November 1922 general election, Johnston lost his seat at the October 1924 general election. He quickly returned to Parliament, winning the Dundee by-election in December.

He was re-elected for Stirling and Clackmannan Western at the 1929 general election, when he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Scotland by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. This troubled administration was relatively short-lived; only a handful of Labour ministers supported MacDonald&#x27;s proposal of a coalition government, with Johnston and other Red Clydesiders among the strong opponents. Long a member of the Independent Labour Party, he opposed its disaffiliation from the Labour Party. He lost his seat at the 1931 general election, and failed to be returned at a by-election in Dunbartonshire in 1932, but he joined the new Scottish Socialist Party, which affiliated to Labour, and he returned (representing Stirling and Clackmannan West) to the House of Commons at the 1935 general election and remained an MP until retiring in the 1945 general election.

Johnston was the key government figure involved in the evacuation of St Kilda, Scotland in 1930. Documents relating to this event, which attracted considerable press attention, are available to view in the National Archives of Scotland.

==The City of Glasgow Friendly Society (now Scottish Friendly)==

On 17 October 1912, Tom Johnston was welcomed to the board of the City of Glasgow Friendly Society (now Scottish Friendly). John Stewart had established the society as a breakaway movement from the Royal Liver Friendly Society some 50 years previously, with the intention of providing a &quot;safe and sound means of investment for the working classes.&quot;

Johnston was appointed vice-president of the society in 1919. On his appointment as Member of Parliament in 1922, he was warmly congratulated by the society&#x27;s board. When many coal miners were unable to pay their premiums during the 1926 British general strike, the society remained supportive, in line with its founding principles; according to Johnston:

:&quot;The City of Glasgow Friendly Society had a reputation for humane dealings with its members. We really did try to live up to the word &#x27;Friendly&#x27;. So when the miners couldn’t pay their premiums, we helped them instead of lapsing them. We were possibly the only office not to lapse a miner during those strikes.&quot;

On 10 October 1932, almost 20 years after joining the board, Johnston was appointed deputy and successor to James Stewart, the son of the society&#x27;s original founder. A brochure printed to mark the society&#x27;s 70th birthday indicated the high regard with which Johnston was held:

:&quot;The task that faced the Board in making this appointment was no light one. To preserve the continuity of success and management it was essential to secure a man, not only intellectually capable, but who was also imbued with the ideals of the Society. The long association of Mr. Johnston with the Society as a Delegate and a Member of the Board, and his outstanding qualities which have made him so prominent a figure in the public life of this country, singles him out as the one person to assist the general manager and ultimately to fill as adequately as it is possible the office of general manager. This choice was the unanimous one of the Board.&quot;

Though an active politician and MP, Johnston devoted considerable time to the society, and proposed novel ideas about life assurance. In December 1933, he addressed the Glasgow and West of Scotland Faculty of Insurance, where he introduced the idea of an all-in social insurance scheme, covering unemployment, health and pensions. In effect, the society played a role in shaping the life assurance movement and what is now known as the Welfare State.

The following year, in 1934, James Stewart retired as general manager of the society and Johnston took over. With the society facing ever-rising administration costs as many of their members relocated to England in search of work, Johnston worked out proposals for co-operation between the collecting societies, proposing a sub-committee be formed. Despite opposition, in October 1934, Johnston was elected to the executive of the Association of Collecting Friendly Societies. He went on pressing for his sub-committee until 1938 when, in view of the reluctance of some of the larger societies to participate, he decided that no useful purpose would be served by proceeding with it.

One of the big changes that occurred during Johnston&#x27;s management was the improvement of Society staff conditions. It was the first of its group to give the staff alternative Saturdays off, and it introduced a special bonus system. On several occasions the board proposed salary increases for the general manager, but on each occasion Johnston refused. In March 1938, for example, the board proposed to increase his salary by £500 a year. As Johnston knew there would have to be economies among the lower tiers of staff, he refused the increase.

In 1941, Tom Johnson was appointed wartime Secretary of State for Scotland by Prime Minister Winston Churchill but continued to work for the society and the principles for which it stood.

When Sir William Beveridge was asked to make a report on industrial assurance, Tom Johnston came back to the campaign he had been waging among the members of the Association of Collecting Friendly Societies. The report &quot;Social Insurance and Allied Services&quot; (known as the Beveridge Report) served as the basis for the post-World War II British welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945.

Responding to the Beveridge Report, a letter to the Association of Collecting Friendly Societies from David White, the interim general manager of the society, reiterated the need to remove some of the unnecessary costs of Industrial Assurance:
:&quot;My Board does not believe it possible or desirable to defend a system of collection which involves 20 or 30 offices collecting in almost every street in the land: in thousands upon thousands of instances two or three offices sending or permitting agents to collect in the same houses, and in extreme cases the same Society sending or permitting two of its agents to collect in the same houses.&quot;

The letter goes on to remind the Association of the attempts by Tom Johnston to get a sub-committee appointed.

In 1946, after 34 years’ active service, Johnston retired as the society&#x27;s general manager. But he did not give up his connection and continued as a director of the trustee company, which held the society&#x27;s investments.

==Wartime roles==
In April 1939, during the build-up to the Second World War, John Anderson, the Home Secretary, appointed Johnston as Commissioner for Civil Defence in Scotland. In this role, Johnston oversaw preparations for aerial bombardment and possible invasion, and the organisation of shelter and relief work. Prime Minister Winston Churchill appointed Johnston as Secretary of State for Scotland on 12 February 1941, and Johnston retained the post until May 1945. As Devine (1999) concludes, &quot;Johnston was a giant figure in Scottish politics and is revered to this day as the greatest Scottish Secretary of the century...In essence, Johnston was promised the powers of a benign dictator.&quot;.

Johnston launched numerous initiatives to promote Scotland. Opposed to the excessive concentration of industry in the English Midlands, he attracted 700 businesses and 90,000 new jobs through his new Scottish Council of Industry. He set up 32 committees to deal with any number of social and economic problems, ranging from juvenile delinquency to sheep farming. He regulated rents, and set up a prototype national health service (see Emergency Hospital Service), using new hospitals set up in the expectation of large numbers of casualties from German bombing. His most successful venture was setting up a system of hydroelectricity using water power in the Scottish Highlands.

A long-standing supporter of the Home Rule movement, he was able to persuade Churchill of the need to counter the Scottish nationalist threat north of the border and created a Scottish Council of State and a Council of Industry as institutions to devolve some power away from Whitehall.

==Post-war activity==
He withdrew from politics in 1945 to run the Hydro Board. Johnston subsequently served as chairman of various Scottish organisations, including the Scottish Tourist Board, the Scottish National Forestry Commission (1945–48) and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (1946–59). He represented Scottish interests in the council appointed to devise the 1951 Festival of Britain. In 1948 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen. He was also Chancellor of Aberdeen University from 1951 until his death in 1965.

==Power to the Glens==

Undoubtedly his greatest legacy was the creation of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.

Until the 1940s, many rural areas of Scotland outwith the Central Belt had little or no electricity supply. There were coal-fired steam-turbine and some diesel-driven power stations serving urban locations, and excess capacity from a few large industrial hydroelectricity stations (e.g. those serving the aluminium smelters at Foyers and Kinlochleven) was made available locally, but there was no widespread distribution of electricity through a comprehensively integrated electric power transmission system such as the present National Grid.

Possibly inspired by the earlier example of the American Tennessee Valley Authority initiative of the New Deal administration of President Franklin D Roosevelt, but undoubtedly determined to address the very strong popular sentiment of the immediate post-war period for a more equitable distribution of the resources and benefits of a modern economy, Johnston strove hard and successfully to win over all interested parties, including generally reluctant landowners, to the goal of harnessing the (then) scarcely developed but naturally well-suited geography and climate of the Scottish Highlands to the generation of electricity by water power. In the three decades following the Second World War, the Hydro Board&#x27;s teams of planners, engineers, architects and labourers succeeded in creating an epic succession of electricity generation and distribution schemes that were world-renowned not only for successfully achieving their technical aims in very demanding terrain but for often doing so in an aesthetically inspiring manner. The economic and social benefits thus brought to all the people of Scotland, and especially those in rural areas, were immense and long-lasting.

==Private life==

In 1920 he published the &quot;History of the Working Classes in Scotland&quot;.

He married Margaret F. Cochrane (d.1977) in 1914 and they were married for over 50 years.

From 1950 to 1952 he served as President of the Scottish History Society.

He died in Milngavie on 5 September 1965.

<text>The Cheeky Girls are a Romanian singing duo consisting of identical twin sisters Gabriela and Monica Irimia. After appearing as auditionees on &quot;&quot;, they achieved success in the UK charts with four top 10 hits between 2002 and 2004. They are best known for their debut single, &quot;Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum)&quot;, which has sold more than 1.2 million units internationally. The Cheeky Girls released their debut studio album, &quot;PartyTime&quot;, in 2003 which reached number 14 in the UK Albums Chart.

==Biography==

Gabriela and Monica were born to Doru and Margit Irimia. Their early life in Romania consisted of studying gymnastics and ballet and touring with the Hungarian State Opera. Moving to the United Kingdom with their mother in 2002, the girls shot to fame as the Cheeky Girls after auditioning on two British TV shows, Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Model Behaviour&quot; and more importantly &quot;&quot;. Following two appearances on the show with their audition, which had judges Pete Waterman and Louis Walsh not knowing what to say – Waterman was later quoted as saying they were the worst act ever – various record companies approached the Granada Press Office. The Press Office contacted Paul Holland at Granada Ventures, who was able to secure them a deal with the Multiply label, part of Telstar Records. &quot;Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum)&quot; was swiftly recorded and released in the first week in December. Entering the chart at number two, the single remained in the top five for five consecutive weeks, four of them at number two.

This was quickly followed up with two more top three hits, &quot;Take Your Shoes Off&quot; and &quot;(Hooray, Hooray!) It&#x27;s a Cheeky Holiday!&quot;. Their style of music is primarily disco-pop, aimed at the pre-teen market. Most of their songs are written by their mother, who also acts as their manager.

On 4 August 2006, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported that the Cheeky Girls were &quot;at rock bottom&quot; and facing bankruptcy action in court owing to not having been paid by their now-defunct record label, Telstar Records. The article said that the women owed £4,500 in unpaid taxes, along with other bills, and that Telstar owed them £2.2 million. Later, it was reported that they owed £130,000 in total.

In September 2009, the act released their Cheeky Girls make-up range, aimed at the young teen market.

On 7 March 2013, the women appeared on the &quot;This Week&quot; BBC TV programme discussing the subject of Romanian immigration to the UK with host Andrew Neil. This followed a short video report by Monica talking about British fears of an invasion of benefit-seekers from their homeland. They previously appeared on the show on 10 July 2008.

==Personal lives==
In December 2006, it was revealed by the tabloids that former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik had broken up with long-time fiancée, ITV weather presenter Siân Lloyd, and was now romantically involved with Gabriela. Öpik &quot;passed documentation on to the singers&#x27; constituency MP and spoke to a Home Office minister,&quot; when the Irimias were facing deportation to Romania. The couple announced their engagement in April 2008 after Öpik proposed in Rome, but the engagement was short-lived and a break-up was announced three months later.
In 2016, Monica married her fiancé of four years, Shaun Taylor, who works as a building contractor.

<text>Found objects are sometimes used in music, often to add unusual percussive elements to a work. Their use in such contexts is as old as music itself, as the original invention of musical instruments almost certainly developed from the sounds of natural objects rather than from any specifically designed instruments.

==Use in classical and experimental music==
The use of found objects in modern classical music is often connected to experiments in indeterminacy and aleatoric music by such composers as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. However, it has reached its ascendancy in those areas of popular music as well, such as the ambient works of Brian Eno. In Eno&#x27;s influential work, found objects are credited on many tracks. The ambient music movement which followed Eno&#x27;s lead has also made use of such sounds, with notable exponents being performers such as Future Sound of London and Autechre, and natural sounds have also been incorporated into many pieces of new-age music. Also other builders like Yuri Landman, Harry Partch (for example his famous cloud chamber bowl instrument), Pierre Bastien, Iner Souster often incorporate found material in their works. Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Parade&quot; is also an example of this unconventional type of compositional practice.

==Use in popular music==
Einstürzende Neubauten became known for incorporating a wide range of found objects in their percussion gear. A more recent example of found objects being used as percussion instruments is Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan from the nu metal band Slipknot, who beats a beer keg with a baseball bat to the beat of the song. The Dodos also played a garbage bin as a part of their percussion gear. Wall of Voodoo drummer Joe Nanini would commonly use pots and pans instead of conventional drums. Many street drummers perform with empty plastic baskets.

The band Neptune uses VCR-casings, scrap metal and all kinds of other found objects to create experimental musical instruments.

Found objects have occasionally been featured in very well-known pop songs: &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; from the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; features bicycle bells and horns as part of the orchestral arrangements.

===Found sounds===
The use of found objects in music takes one of two general forms: either objects are deliberately recorded, with their sound used directly or in processed form, or previous recordings are sampled for use as part of a work (the latter often being referred to simply as &quot;found sound&quot; or &quot;sampling&quot;). With the improvement and easy accessibility of sampling technology since the 1980s, this second method has flourished and is a major component of much modern popular music, particularly in such genres as hip hop. Found sounds are also used significantly in certain areas of Industrial music, especially metallic sounds that are the result of hitting or belabouring solid metal objects and surfaces.

<doc id="419239" wikidata="Q644077" url="?curid=419239" title="Nebula Award for Best Script">
<text>The Nebula Award for Best Script was given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy scripts for movies or television episodes. Awards are also given out for published literary works in the novel, novella, novelette, and short story categories. The Nebula Award for Best Script was awarded annually from 1974 through 1978, and from 2000 through 2009. It was presented under several names; in 1974, 1975, and 1977 the award was for Best Dramatic Presentation, while in 1976 the award was for Best Dramatic Writing. The award was discontinued in 2010 and replaced with Ray Bradbury Nebula Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation; this award was not originally a Nebula but was made one retroactively in 2019, and is presented at the Nebula Awards Ceremony and follows Nebula rules and procedures. The Nebula Awards have been described as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot; and &quot;the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent&quot; of the Emmy Awards.

== Selection process ==

Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be a member. Works are nominated each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then reach the final ballot in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary ballot for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.

== Award statistics ==

During the 15 nomination years, 14 awards for Best Script have been given, including the special award given to &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; in 1978 but not including 1977, since no nominee was given the award.

<text>John Trudell (February 15, 1946December 8, 2015) was an American author, poet, actor, musician, and political activist. He was the spokesperson for the Indians of All Tribes&#x27; takeover of Alcatraz beginning in 1969, broadcasting as &quot;Radio Free Alcatraz&quot;. During most of the 1970s, he served as the chairman of the American Indian Movement, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

After his pregnant wife, three children and mother-in-law were killed in 1979 in a suspicious fire at the home of his parents-in-law on the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes Duck Valley Indian Reservation in Nevada, Trudell turned to writing, music and film as a second career. He acted in films in the 1990s. The documentary &quot;Trudell&quot; (2005) was made about him and his life as an activist and artist.

== Early life and education ==
Trudell was born in Omaha, Nebraska on February 15, 1946, the son of a Santee Dakota father and a Mexican mother. He grew up in small towns near the Santee Sioux Reservation in northern Nebraska near the southeast corner of South Dakota. He was educated in local schools and also in Santee Dakota culture.

==Military service==
At the age of 17 in 1963, Trudell dropped out of high school and left the Midwest to join the US Navy. He served during the early years of the Vietnam War and stayed in the Navy until 1967.

Afterwards, he attended San Bernardino Valley College, a two-year community college in San Bernardino, California, studying radio and broadcasting.

==Activism==
After leaving the military, Trudell had become involved in Indian activism. In 1969, he became the spokesperson for the United Indians of All Tribes&#x27; occupation of Alcatraz Island. This was a mostly student-member group that had developed in San Francisco. Trudell went to Alcatraz a week after the occupation started. He used his background in broadcasting and ran a radio station from the island through a cooperative arrangement with students at the University of California, Berkeley, broadcasting at night over the Berkeley FM station KPFA. The show was called &quot;Radio Free Alcatraz&quot;. He discussed the cause of the occupation and American Indian issues and played traditional Native American music. He criticized how &quot;the system today is only geared toward white needs.&quot; He spoke for the many Indigenous people who believed they did not fit in with the majority of European-American population of the nation. He became a spokesperson for the occupation specifically and for the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement generally, as the author Vine Deloria, Jr. named it. Trudell was the spokesman for the nearly two-year-long occupation, until 1971.

After the failure of the federal government to meet demands of the protesters at Alcatraz, Trudell joined the American Indian Movement. It had been established in 1968 in Minneapolis among urban American Indians, first to deal with alleged police harassment and injustice in the law enforcement system. Trudell acted as its national chairman from 1973 until 1979. He took the position after the first chairman, Carter Camp, was convicted for actions related to a protest and was sentenced to jail.

===Loss of family in house fire===
On February 12, 1979, Trudell&#x27;s wife Tina Manning, their three children and his mother-in-law, Leah Hicks-Manning, died in a suspicious fire at the home of his parents-in-law on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in Nevada. His father-in-law Arthur Manning survived. He was a member of the Duck Valley Shoshone Paiute&#x27;s Tribal Council which was working for treaty rights. Opponents included the local tribal police chief and the BIA superintendent, John Artichoker. Leah coordinated social services at the reservation. Tina had been working for tribal water rights at the Wild Horse Reservoir. Opponents of her campaign included officials of the local BIA, Elko County and Nevada state officials, members of the water recreation industry, and local white ranchers. Other activists have also speculated whether there was government involvement behind the tragedy. The house fire that killed Trudell&#x27;s family happened within 24 hours of him burning a US flag on the steps of the FBI building in Washington D.C. in protest of the government&#x27;s treatment of Native Americans and the Sioux Nation. Trudell believed that the fire was meant to threaten and silence him and his activist wife.

Trudell believed that the fire was arson, but the BIA police investigation claimed that it was accidental. In numerous interviews, he expressed distrust for the federal government and specifically the FBI. The FBI has been implicated in wrongdoing in Pine Ridge and other reservations during this period, which included offering monetary support to Dick Wilson&#x27;s Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONS). Essentially the GOONS, paid by Dickie Wilson (who in turn was paid by the FBI), the then Band Council Chief (elected in what many believe was a rigged election), terrorized and murdered traditional Sioux people who spoke out against federal government treatment of American Indian people.

=== Aquash murder controversy ===
In 2004, Trudell testified in the federal trial of Arlo Looking Cloud, an Oglala Lakota American Indian Movement (AIM) member charged in the kidnapping and murder of Anna Mae Aquash, the highest-ranking woman in AIM, in December 1975. Trudell testified that Looking Cloud had told him that John Graham, another low-level AIM member, was the gunman in the murder. Trudell identified Graham from photographs. Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

His testimony was part of the evidence considered by the Canadian judge who ordered Graham&#x27;s extradition to the United States in February 2005. On March 2, 2005, the Native Youth Movement Vancouver announced a boycott of Trudell&#x27;s music and poetry in retaliation for his testimony and alleged that the FBI had killed Aquash. In 2010, Graham was convicted in a South Dakota state court of felony murder of Aquash and sentenced to life imprisonment.

===Later years===
Trudell was the co-founder, with Willie Nelson, of Hempstead Project Heart, which became a project of Earth Island Institute in 2012. Hempstead Project Heart is dedicated to raising awareness about the environmental, social, and economic benefits of legalizing industrial hemp in America.

Trudell was also involved with Seva Foundation and their Native American programs. He performed at numerous benefit concerts in support of their work.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Trudell married his first wife, Fenicia &quot;Lou&quot; Ordonez, divorcing in 1970. They had one son, Wovoka Trudell, who was born on Alcatraz Island; and a daughter, Tara Evonne Trudell.

In 1972, Trudell married Tina Manning, an activist of the Duck Valley Shoshone Paiute Tribe. They had three children together: Ricarda Star, Sunshine Karma, and Eli Changing Sun. In February 1979, Tina (who was pregnant), the children and her mother Leah Hicks-Manning were all killed in a fire at her parents&#x27; house on the Duck Valley Reservation. Her father Arthur survived. This occurred within a day of John Trudell burning the American Flag on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington D.C.

Trudell was in a relationship with Marcheline Bertrand, the mother of actress Angelina Jolie, at the time of her death from cancer in 2007.

In early December 2015, it was announced that Trudell was in the last stages of terminal cancer. His death was prematurely announced on the evening of December 4, 2015; his publicist asked for a retraction and the stories were largely removed from the websites where they had been posted. Trudell died on December 8, 2015. According to Independent Lens, one of his last statements was: &quot;I want people to remember me as they remember me.&quot; After his death, a family member posted: &quot;My ride showed up. Celebrate Love. Celebrate Life,&quot; on his Facebook page.

==Musical career==
In 1979, Trudell met musical artist and activist Jackson Browne and became more interested in the musical world (and recording albums and performing his own compositions in live venues).

Trudell recorded an album &quot;AKA Grafitti Man&quot; (&quot;graffiti&quot; was misspelled in the title) with Kiowa guitarist Jesse Ed Davis that was originally available on cassette tape format only. This comports with the practice common to American Indigenous and other minorities of distributing music mixtapes. These tapes were captured live at group events and copied and distributed through non-commercial channels, like those of the San Francisco-based rock group Grateful Dead, Native American powwow music performances in general, and African American gatherings - whence came the expression Each One Teach One. These tactics were common also to an emerging grassroots movement that was arguably itself a &quot;response&quot; to the reactionary madness of slavery and/or military-industrial/imperialist hegemony flourishing since the 1980s.

In 1990, he took part in Tony Hymas&#x27;s &quot;Oyaté&quot; project.

In 1992, Trudell remade and re-released &quot;AKA Grafitti Man&quot; as an audio CD to substantial critical and popular acclaim.

Arguably his greatest musical success came with the 1994 album &quot;Johnny Damas &amp; Me&quot; that was described as &quot;a culmination of years of poetic work, and an example of a process of fusing traditional sounds, values, and sensibilities with thought-provoking lyrics, this time with urgent rock and roll.&quot;

His musical releases (many with his band Bad Dog) include &quot;A.K.A Grafitti Man&quot; (1986), &quot;Heart Jump Bouquet&quot; (1987), &quot;Blue Indians&quot; (1999), &quot;Descendant Now Ancestor&quot; (2001), &quot;Bone Days&quot; (2001), &quot;Live A Fip&quot; (2003), &quot;Madness and The Moremes&quot; (2007), &quot;Crazier Than Hell&quot; (2010), &quot;Wazi&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2015).

Popular Music critic Neal Ullestad said of Trudell&#x27;s live performances, &quot;This isn&#x27;t simply pop rock with Indian drums and chants added. It&#x27;s integrated rock and roll by an American Indian with a multicultural band directed to anyone who will listen.&quot;

The closing sequence of Alanis Obomsawin&#x27;s 2014 documentary film &quot;Trick or Treaty?&quot; is set to Trudell&#x27;s song &quot;Crazy Horse.&quot;

== Writing career ==
About six months after the deaths of his family, Trudell started writing poetry. He described his work, &quot;They&#x27;re called poems, but in reality they&#x27;re lines given to me to hang on to.&quot; He has written many poems, including &quot;Baby Boom Che&quot; and &quot;Rant and Roll,&quot; and hundreds of others.

In the 2010s he often shared recent poetic musings and written works-in-progress via social media, such as his Facebook page.

Various impromptu videos of Trudell in live concert appearances or addressing political, social, indigenous rights and educational groups are posted on YouTube, and although he was sought after by various print and broadcast media outlets for &quot;sound byte commentary,&quot; Trudell preferred to speak in a less frenetic style directly to gatherings assembled for specific causes that he supported (e.g., advocating on behalf of re-legalizing hemp cultivation for its many beneficial uses, including sustainable paper pulp).

Trudell often used his poetry as lyrics for recordings and began in 1982 to set them to traditional American Indian music, which also in the 1980s eventually led to the recording of &quot;A.K.A Graffiti Man&quot;, as he struggled to make sense of bewildering situations that confronted him, including the loss of so many loved ones.

In late 1988, Australian rock band Midnight Oil invited Trudell (as Graffiti Man) to tour with them during their &quot;From Diesel and Dust to the Big Mountain&quot; world tour. They billed Trudell&#x27;s part of the show as &quot;Native American activist performance.&quot; Members of Midnight Oil played traditional instruments, sang in native American languages, and accompanied songs with heavy psychedelic Hendrix-style guitar, accompanying Trudell. This exposure brought Trudell new and larger audiences.

Trudell also toured in 1993 with Peter Gabriel&#x27;s global WOMAD (World Music and Dance) production. He was billed as John Trudell, performing his traditional songs and reading his poetry.

In 2008, Trudell published a book, &quot;Lines From a Mined Mind: The Words of John Trudell,&quot; a collection of 25 years of poetry, lyrics and essays.

== Acting ==
Trudell created a career as an actor, performing in roles in &quot;Pow Wow Highway&quot; (1989), &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992), &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; (1994) and &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; (1998) (as the Radio speaker Randy Peone on K-REZ radio). He was an adviser to the production of &quot;Incident at Oglala&quot;, directed by Michael Apted and produced by Robert Redford. A kind of companion piece to the fictional &quot;Thunderheart&quot;, the 1992 documentary explores facts related to the 1975 shooting of two FBI agents at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, for which Leonard Peltier was convicted in 1977. In &quot;Thunderheart&quot;, Trudell played a character who resembles Peltier.

==Documentary==
The filmmaker Heather Rae spent more than a decade making a documentary about Trudell, which was released in 2005. Her intent in &quot;Trudell&quot; (2005) was to demonstrate how his political and cultural activities were tied to contemporary history and inspired people. The film premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. documentary competition. The movie has received a mixed response among film critics and viewers. Some claimed it to be thought-provoking and touching, while others suggested Rae made a one-dimensional biopic. The song used at the end of the film is &quot;Johnny Lobo&quot; about Trudell by Kris Kristofferson, from his 1995 album &quot;A Moment of Forever&quot;.

<doc id="419243" wikidata="Q370136" url="?curid=419243" title="George William Hill">
<text>George William Hill (March 3, 1838 – April 16, 1914) was an American astronomer and mathematician. Working independently and largely in isolation from the wider scientific community, he made major contributions to celestial mechanics and to the theory of ordinary differential equations. The importance of his work was explicitly acknowledged by Henri Poincaré in 1905. In 1909 Hill was awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal, &quot;on the ground of his researches in mathematical astronomy&quot;. Hill is remembered for the Hill differential equation, along with the Hill sphere.

== Early life and education ==
Hill was born in New York City to painter and engraver John William Hill and his wife, Catherine Smith. He moved to West Nyack with his family when he was eight years old. After high school, Hill attended Rutgers College, where he became interested in mathematics.

At Rutgers, Hill came under the influence of professor Theodore Strong, who was a friend of pioneering US mathematician and astronomer Nathaniel Bowditch. Strong encouraged Hill to read the great works on analysis by Sylvestre Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, as well as the treatises on mechanics and mathematical astronomy by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Siméon Denis Poisson, and Gustave de Pontécoulant.

Hill graduated from Rutgers College in 1859, with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In that same year he published his first scientific paper, on the geometrical curve of a drawbridge. Two years later he earned a prize from the &quot;Runkle Mathematical Monthly&quot; for his work on the mathematical theory of the figure of the Earth.

In the early 1860s, Hill began studying the works on lunar theory by Charles-Eugène Delaunay and Peter Andreas Hansen, which would inspire and motivate most of Hill&#x27;s subsequent research. In 1861, Hill was hired by John Daniel Runkle to work in the United States Naval Observatory&#x27;s Nautical Almanac Office, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1862 Rutgers awarded Hill a Master of Arts degree. Hill lived for a while in Cambridge and later in Washington, D.C., but he preferred to carry out his mathematical work in his family farm in West Nyack, to which he retired for good after 1892.

== Work on mathematical astronomy ==
Hill&#x27;s mature work focused on the mathematics of the three-body problem, and later the four-body problem, to calculate the orbits of the Moon around the Earth, as well as that of planets around the Sun. Hill was able to quantify the gravitational sphere of influence of an astronomical body in the presence of other heavy bodies, by introducing the concept of the zero-velocity surface. The space within this surface is called the Hill sphere, which corresponds to the region around a body within which it may capture satellites.

In 1878, Hill provided the first complete mathematical solution to the problem of the apsidal precession of the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth, a difficult problem in lunar theory first raised in Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; of 1687. This same work also introduced what became known in physics and mathematics as the &quot;Hill differential equation&quot;, which describes the behavior of a parametric oscillator and which made an important contribution to the mathematical Floquet theory.

== Influence and recognition ==
Hill&#x27;s work attracted the attention of the international scientific community, and in 1894 he was chosen as president of the American Mathematical Society, serving for two years. Hill lectured at Columbia University from 1898 to 1901, but he attracted few students and he ultimately chose to return his salary and to continue working alone in his home in West Nyack, rather than within academia.

Hill&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot; were published in 1905-07 by the Carnegie Institution for Science, with a 12-page introduction by the eminent French mathematician and theoretical physicist Henri Poincaré. In that introduction, Poincaré said that, in Hill&#x27;s 1878 article titled &quot;Researches in the lunar theory&quot;, &quot;one is allowed to perceive the germ of most of the progress that [celestial mechanics] has made ever since&quot;. Of Hill&#x27;s isolation from the academic community, Poincaré declared that

George William Hill was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1902. He also became a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1908, and of the scientific academies of Belgium (1909), Norway (1910), Sweden (1913), and the Netherlands (1914). His later years were marked by poor health, and he died in West Nyack in 1914. He never married and had no children.

<doc id="419244" wikidata="Q115174410" url="?curid=419244" title="Nakina, Ontario">
<text>Nakina is a community in the Town of Greenstone in the Thunder Bay District in Northern Ontario, Canada. It is approximately north of Geraldton, located along the Canadian National Railway. The origins of the town were initially support of the railway, but its economy has evolved through lumber, pulp and paper, mining and tourism. It has a population of about 500 people.

It was a separate municipality from 1978 until 2001, when it was amalgamated with the former Township of Beardmore, and the Towns of Geraldton and Longlac. Its name is an indigenous word meaning &quot;meeting place&quot;.

==History==
Nakina was first established in 1913 as flag stop on the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR), between the divisional points of Grant and Armstrong. Nakina was at Mile 15.9 of the NTR&#x27;s Grant Sub-Division.

After the NTR was nationalized into the Canadian National Railway (CNR) in 1923, the CNR decided to create a &quot;shortcut&quot; between the tracks of the Canadian Northern Railway at Longlac to the National Transcontinental Railway at Nakina (called the Longlac-Nakina Cut-Off), which would reduce travel time by 4 hours. This prompted the development of the town, since Nakina replaced Grant (25 kilometers to the east) as the new divisional point. A repair and refueling complex, including a new large 2-storey station, was built at Nakina. The entire town of Grant was moved by flatcars to the new Nakina town site, including a store house, the 12-stall round house with machine shop and 75&#x27; turntable, 200-ton coal plant, 1,000-ton ice house, 70,000-gallon water tank, and staff resthouse. The community was briefly renamed Thornton Junction, after Henry Worth Thornton, then president of the CNR.

From the 1920s on, Nakina prospered as an important railway service stop.

During World War II, there was also a radar base on the edge of the town, intended to watch for a potential attacks on the strategically important locks at Sault Ste. Marie between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Research into the radar site in the National Archives of Canada indicates that it was largely a United States Army Air Forces operation, that pre-dated the later Pinetree Line radar bases that were erected shortly thereafter focussing on the cold-war threat. The Nakina base was totally removed shortly after the war.

In 1955, the road from Geraldton to Nakina was built, connecting it with the Trans-Canada Highway.

The introduction of diesel locomotives after World War II meant that service and maintenance could be consolidated at points much more distant from one another than had been common in the first half of the 20th century. As a result, the value of Nakina as a railway service community greatly diminished. In 1958, the last steam engine left Nakina. Railway shops closed in the 1960s, and its status as a maintenance centre ended in 1986, when trains would no longer stop to change crews. That same year Nakina ceased to be a station stop.

In the 1970s, pulp and paper operations near the town offset the decline in railway employment. In 1978, the place was incorporated as the Township of Nakina and had a peak population of nearly 1000 in the 1981 census.

In 2001, Nakina was amalgamated with the former Township of Beardmore and the Towns of Geraldton and Longlac, together with previously unorganized areas, into the new municipality of Greenstone.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
In March 2018, The North West Company shuttered the town&#x27;s Northern Store branch, deeming it no longer financially sustainable. This closure represented the loss of the last major retail outlet in Nakina.

, the town remains focused on tourism, diminished pulp and paper operations, and support of other more northern communities (food, fuel and transportation). Mining and minerals industries are seen as a possible source of further growth, including via a potential all-season road link to the Ring of Fire mining project.

==Transportation==
Access to the remote northern community is via Highway 584 from Highway 11 at Geraldton.

Nakina is served by Via Rail at the Nakina station, and by charter flights at the Nakina Airport. Nakina Water Aerodrome is just north of the community on Cordingley Lake, where a float plane service provides transport to a variety of different lakes.

<text>Steven Saylor (born March 23, 1956) is an American author of historical novels. He is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied history and classics.

Saylor&#x27;s best-known work is his &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; historical mystery series, set in ancient Rome. The novels&#x27; hero is a detective named Gordianus the Finder, active during the time of Sulla, Cicero, Julius Caesar, and Cleopatra. Outside this crime novel series, Saylor has also written three epic-length historical novels about the city of Rome, &quot;Roma&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, and &quot;Dominus&quot;. His work has been published in 21 languages.

Saylor has also written two novels set in Texas. &quot;A Twist at the End&quot;, featuring O. Henry, is set in Austin in the 1880s and based on real-life serial murders and trials (the case of the so-called Servant Girl Annihilator). &quot;Have You Seen Dawn?&quot; is a contemporary thriller set in a fictional Texas town, Amethyst, based on Saylor&#x27;s hometown, Goldthwaite, Texas.

Saylor contributed autobiographical essays to three anthologies of gay writing edited by John Preston, &quot;Hometowns&quot;, &quot;A Member of the Family&quot;, and &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, and prior to his novel-writing career he published gay erotic fiction under the pen name Aaron Travis.

Saylor has lived with Richard Solomon since 1976; they registered as domestic partners in San Francisco in 1991 and later dissolved that partnership in order to legally marry in October 2008. The couple split their time between properties in Berkeley, California, and Austin, Texas.

<doc id="419247" wikidata="Q2683169" url="?curid=419247" title="Davey Allison">
<text>David Carl Allison (February 25, 1961 – July 13, 1993) was an American NASCAR driver. He was best known for driving the No. 28 Texaco-Havoline Ford for Robert Yates Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. Born in Hollywood, Florida, he was the oldest of four children born to Bobby and Judy Allison. The family moved to Hueytown, Alabama, and along with Bobby Allison&#x27;s brother, Donnie, Red Farmer and Neil Bonnett, became known as the Alabama Gang.

==Early career==
Growing up, Allison participated in athletics, preferring football, but settled upon automobile racing. He began working for his father&#x27;s NASCAR Winston Cup Series team after graduating high school, and built a race car of his own, a Chevy Nova, with friends known as the &quot;Peach Fuzz Gang.&quot; He began his career in 1979 at Birmingham International Raceway and won his first race in his sixth start. He became a regular winner at BIR, and by 1983 was racing in the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) series. Allison won two ARCA events at his home track, Talladega Superspeedway, in 1983, and was named ARCA Rookie of the Year in 1984, placing second in the series title. That same year he married his first wife, Deborah.

Allison continued racing in the ARCA series in 1985, winning eight races in the series, four at Talladega Superspeedway. He competed in some of NASCAR&#x27;s lower divisions. In the Busch series, his crew chief was Red Farmer. In July 1985, car owner Hoss Ellington gave Allison an opportunity to drive a NASCAR Winston Cup Series car in the Talladega 500. Allison qualified 22nd In Ellington&#x27;s Chevrolet and finished 10th in his first Winston Cup start. The wins earned Allison more NASCAR Cup Series opportunities in 1986, when he made 4 starts in the No. 95 Sadler Racing Chevrolet entry with Tom Pistone serving as crew chief. Davey later substituted for injured racer Neil Bonnett in Junior Johnson&#x27;s No. 12 Budweiser Chevy, starting and finishing 7th in the Talladega 500.

==NASCAR==

=== Early Winston Cup career ===
Prior to the 1987 season, car owner Harry Ranier tapped Davey to replace veteran driver Cale Yarborough in the Ranier-Lundy No. 28 Ford Thunderbird. Yarborough was leaving the Ranier-Lundy team to start his own operation along with the team&#x27;s sponsor, Hardee&#x27;s. Ranier negotiated a sponsorship deal with Texaco&#x27;s Havoline motor oil brand, a deal that was signed during the NASCAR edition of Speedweeks at Daytona International Speedway. On qualifying day, Davey signalled that he was in Winston Cup to stay when he qualified an unmarked, but Texaco-Havoline painted No. 28 Thunderbird second for the 1987 Daytona 500, becoming the first rookie ever to start on the front row for NASCAR&#x27;s most prestigious event. A pit miscue which allowed a rear tire to fall off on the track ended his hopes of a good finish in the race, but success for Davey Allison would be just around the corner.

May 3, 1987 would become an infamous day in NASCAR history. Earlier in the week, Bill Elliott had qualified his No. 9 Coors-Melling Ford Thunderbird at a record 212.809 mph (a record which still stands today) for the Winston 500 at the unlighted Talladega Superspeedway. Davey Allison would qualify third, while father Bobby would start second alongside Elliott in the Stavola Brothers No. 22 Miller Buick. On lap 22 of the event, Bobby Allison ran over a piece of debris, cutting his right-rear tire. The car turned sideways, lifted into the air, became airborne, and crashed vertically into the frontstretch spectator fence near the start finish line. The car landed back on the track and collected a number of other competitors. Davey was ahead of his father at the time and saw the crash unfold in his mirror. Bobby Allison was not injured, but the crash slightly injured several spectators and the race was red-flagged for two hours and thirty-eight minutes. It was this event that triggered the requirement of smaller carburetors, and later, carburetor restrictor plates on engines at Daytona and Talladega to reduce the top speeds.

When the race resumed, Allison continued to run up front and when Elliott exited the race with engine failure, his toughest competition was eliminated. With darkness falling during a late caution flag, the decision was made to end the race 10 laps short of its 188 lap distance. Running second on the restart, Allison passed leader Dale Earnhardt on the backstretch and pulled away for his first Winston Cup win. In winning the race, Allison became the first rookie since Ron Bouchard in 1981 to win a Winston Cup event.

Allison would better that feat just 28 days later by winning the Budweiser 500 at Dover International Speedway (then the Dover Downs International Speedway), becoming, at the time, the only rookie to win two Winston Cup events. In all, Allison started 22 of the 29 Winston Cup races in 1987, winning twice, and scoring nine top-five and 10 top-ten finishes. He also won five poles in his rookie season.

The 1988 season started with much promise. Allison again started outside the front row for the Daytona 500, the first modern day race utilizing the NASCAR-mandated carburetor restrictor plate. While father Bobby was battling up front early in the race, Davey and his team struggled with a car that was repaired during the early morning hours following a crash in the final practice session. As the race came to a conclusion, Davey found himself running second, just behind his father. Bobby Allison would go on to hold off his son and win his third Daytona 500. Father and son would celebrate their one-two finish in victory lane.

Davey Allison would struggle through much of the first half of the 1988 season as he ran some of the Winston Cup short tracks for the first time. The team was also suffering from engine failures and now sole-owner Harry Ranier was looking to sell the team. Crew chief Joey Knuckles was fired and engine builder Robert Yates replaced him. Then on June 19, at Pocono International Raceway came his father&#x27;s near-fatal, career-ending crash.

With his father clinging to life in a Pennsylvania hospital, Davey Allison raced on but failed to finish the next three events. The team rebounded when the series returned to Pocono in July with Allison scoring a third-place finish. Back at Talladega, the No. 28 Ford again suffered engine failure but Allison would drive his father&#x27;s car later in the race when relief driver Mike Alexander was overcome by heat. Two races later, Allison would score his first win of the season at Michigan International Speedway. The win changed the fortunes for the financially strapped team and after a series of top-5 and top-10 finishes, Allison would win the inaugural race at the new Richmond International Raceway. On October 1, 1988, Ranier sold the team to Yates, who temporarily remained as Allison&#x27;s crew chief for the balance of the season, before undertaking full ownership. The rest of the season was a mixed bag but Allison would finish the season with a third-place finish at Phoenix International Raceway, and a second at the season ending Atlanta Journal 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He would finish eighth in the final Winston Cup standings. But the roller coaster 1988 Winston Cup season had taken a toll on Davey Allison&#x27;s marriage and he and Deborah quietly divorced during the offseason.

=== Initial years with Robert Yates Racing (1989–1990) ===

Davey Allison&#x27;s 1989 season did not start well. A year after he and his father&#x27;s one-two Daytona 500 finish, Davey started at 16th, then was involved in an early incident with Geoff Bodine that sent his car careening into the sand bar separating the track&#x27;s backstretch from Lake Lloyd. The car made one slow, complete, roll-over with Davey eventually restarting the car and driving it back to the pits. He drove the damaged, hood-less car to a 25th-place finish and had a heated exchange with Bodine following the race (the first of several exchanges with other drivers during his career).

The team rebounded at Rockingham and when the series moved to Talladega in May for the Winston 500, Davey had scored one top-10 and three top-5 finishes. Davey started on the pole at Talladega and got his first win of 1989, his second victory in Talladega&#x27;s spring event. After the race, Davey stood sixth in the Winston Cup Championship standings, but did not win again until the next restrictor plate race, the Pepsi 400 at Daytona, his last win of the season. By the end of the season, Davey had collected seven top-five and 13 top-ten finishes along with one pole position to go with the two wins. He slipped to 11th in the final Winston Cup standings. However, Davey would marry his second wife, Liz, during the season, and their first child, Krista, was born prior to the 1990 season.

The 1990 season did not start much better than the 1989 season and by the sixth race at Bristol, Davey was a 17th in the Winston Cup standings. A poor qualifying run had the team pitting in the backstretch pits, which usually doomed a team&#x27;s chances of winning the race. But the team owner decided against pitting on the final caution flag and Davey scored his second short-track win in a thrilling photo-finish with Mark Martin, winning by just eight inches. But the win did not change the team&#x27;s fortunes and after an ill-handling car at Dover required Davey to ask for relief from fellow Alabama driver Hut Stricklin, Robert Yates decided to hire &quot;Suitcase&quot; Jake Elder as the team&#x27;s crew chief. Davey won the fall event at Charlotte Motor Speedway but finished the season 13th in the final Winston Cup standings. He again posted two wins, but only five top-five and 10 top-ten finishes.

=== Larry McReynolds&#x27; hiring (1991) ===
The 1991 season began with much promise. Davey won the pole for the Daytona 500 and was in contention for the win until the final laps. After a late race restart, eventual winner Ernie Irvan passed Dale Earnhardt for the lead. Davey tried to follow Irvan around Earnhardt but could not make the pass and the two drivers battled side by side for a few laps. As the cars came off turn two, Earnhardt&#x27;s car spun, collecting Allison and Kyle Petty. Davey was unable to continue and finished 15th. From there, things went downhill. Davey finished 12th at Richmond, 16th at Rockingham, then crashed hard early in the Motorcraft 500 at Atlanta, finishing 40th. Davey was openly feuding with crew chief Elder, and Allison threatened to quit the team if Elder stayed. After the poor result at Atlanta, Robert Yates decided that he had to make a change at crew chief.

Elder was fired, and Larry McReynolds was hired away from the Kenny Bernstein team to replace him. In his first race with McReynolds at the helm, Allison finished second at the 1991 Transouth 400. A third-place finish followed at Bristol, then a sixth at North Wilkesboro and an eighth at Martinsville. The team finished 22nd at Talladega due to a large accident triggered by Ernie Irvan but there was no doubt the team was much improved and was destined for bigger things.

Two weeks later, Davey dominated The Winston all-star race at Charlotte, and continued his domination by winning the Coca-Cola 600 the following week, leading 263 of the race&#x27;s 400 laps. Two races later, Davey won his first road course event at then Sears Point International Raceway where he was awarded the victory after Ricky Rudd was penalized by NASCAR for spinning Allison out on the final lap. He won again at Michigan then finished third in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. At the halfway point of the 1991 season, Davey had climbed to fifth in the Winston Cup point standings.

After finishing 14th at Pocono, the series moved to Talladega. As the race wound down, Davey Allison aimed for yet another win behind leader Dale Earnhardt. But Davey was unable to get drafting help from fellow Ford Motor Company drivers, and he slipped to ninth place after attempting to pass Earnhardt for the lead. In his post-race interview, Allison stated &quot;All we needed was three inches to clear Earnhardt, when you can&#x27;t get help from a fellow Ford driver, that&#x27;s pitiful.&quot; In a fit of rage after the race, Allison punched a wall in the team&#x27;s transporter, breaking his wrist. The injury failed to slow him down, however, as he finished a remarkable 10th on the road course at Watkins Glen, then was second at Michigan, a photo-finish, in which Dale Jarrett scored his first Winston Cup victory. Davey scored back-to-back victories at Rockingham and Phoenix and entered the final race at Atlanta second in the Winston Cup standings. But a dead battery in that race relegated him to a 17th-place finish, dropping him to third in the final standings, only four points behind Ricky Rudd. Dale Earnhardt won the championship. The final tally of the 1991 season for Davey Allison; five wins, 12 top-five and 16 top-ten finishes, and three pole positions. It was also during the 1991 season that Davey and Liz welcomed their second child, a son, Robert Grey Allison. With Larry McReynolds at the helm, Davey Allison entered the 1992 season as a legitimate championship contender.

=== 1992 ===

Statistically, 1992 was Davey Allison&#x27;s best season in Winston Cup racing. Davey started sixth in the 1992 Daytona 500 but was probably not quite as fast as the Junior Johnson teammates of Bill Elliott and Sterling Marlin. But the race would change dramatically on lap 92 when Elliott, Marlin, and Ernie Irvan triggered a multi-car crash at the front of the pack. Fourteen cars were eliminated, but Allison—and eventual runner-up Morgan Shepherd—somehow made it through the mess. He would dominate the event, lead 127 laps to join his father as a Daytona 500 winner. Allison was also the only driver to lead the Daytona 500 at halfway and go on to win, until Denny Hamlin won the 2016 race.

Bill Elliott would rebound to win the next four events, but Allison was not far behind in each event, posting four top-five finishes to maintain his lead in the points. A hard crash in the Food City 500 at Bristol left him with a bruised shoulder, and the following weekend the team had Jimmy Hensley on hand for relief just in case Allison could not go the distance. Allison managed to race through the pain and go the distance, winning at North Wilkesboro after beating Rusty Wallace and Geoffrey Bodine off pit road with a fast pit stop and leading the remaining laps en route to victory. Another hard crash at Martinsville re-injured his ribs, but Allison rebounded yet again, leading a contingent of Fords to victory in the Winston 500 at Talladega using the same car with which he won the Daytona 500. This would be Allison&#x27;s third victory at Talladega. The win also put him in position to win the Winston Million if he could finish off the &quot;small slam&quot; with a win in either the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, or the Southern 500 at Darlington.

Next up was The Winston all-star race. One year removed from his domination of that event and the Coca-Cola 600, Davey was ready to take the spotlight again. But this time around, there was more focus on the event itself. Over the winter, the Musco Lighting company had installed a state-of-the-art lighting system at then Charlotte Motor Speedway. Billed as &quot;One Hot Night&quot; by The Nashville Network, which was to broadcast the event, The Winston was the first superspeedway race to be held under the lights. Davey would drive the same car that he used to dominate the event one year earlier, affectionately known as &quot;007.&quot;

In the final, 10-lap segment of the race, Dale Earnhardt led, followed by Kyle Petty and Davey. In the third turn on the final lap, Petty got under Earnhardt&#x27;s car and the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet spun. Davey took advantage of this and jumped into the lead. But Petty charged back and as Davey crossed the start-finish line to win the race, the two cars came together, sending the driver&#x27;s side of Davey&#x27;s car hard into the outside wall in a shower of sparks. An unconscious Allison was taken from his car and airlifted to a Charlotte hospital. The crash left him with a concussion, bruised lung, and a battered and bruised body.

His car, &quot;007,&quot; was totaled. Allison would later claim to have sustained an out-of-body experience after the crash. He claimed to have awoke to see his crashed car below him as he rose away from it, and to have turned his attention away from the frantic work of the emergency workers to a bright light above, which faded and left him in darkness until he awoke later in the hospital. McReynolds stated during the FOX telecasts that the first words from Allison when he awoke in the hospital were &quot;Did we win?&quot; McReynolds told Allison &quot;Yes, Davey, we won.&quot; Victory celebrations went on even though the driver was not present, and all of the crew members later went to the hospital to be with their driver.

The wreck did not deter Allison. He finished fourth in the Coca-Cola 600 the following week despite the injuries and maintained his points lead. He then finished 11th at Dover, 28th at Sears Point, and fifth at Pocono. Still hanging onto the points lead, and his body healing, Davey won the pole and dominated the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at Michigan, leading 158 of the race&#x27;s 200 laps. The first half of the season ended with Davey posting a 10th-place finish in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. At the halfway point of the season, Allison had a 46-point lead over second place Bill Elliott and a 134-point lead over third place Alan Kulwicki, and had held the points lead since the first race of the season, despite the injuries and setbacks.

That would all change as the series went back to Pocono. Davey won the pole for the event and led 115 of the first 149 laps. But a lengthy pit stop during a caution flag sent him to the middle of the pack. On lap 150, Allison was charging back through the pack, followed closely by Darrell Waltrip. The two cars made contact and Davey went sliding into the grass off Pocono&#x27;s &quot;tunnel turn.&quot; The car went airborne and began a series of violent flips before landing on top of an infield guardrail. Miraculously, Davey survived the crash. He was airlifted to the hospital with a severe concussion, along with a broken arm, wrist, and collar bone. His 33rd-place finish left him nine points behind Bill Elliott for the series title, but that seemed insignificant at the moment. Especially traumatizing was the fact that Pocono was the site of Davey&#x27;s father Bobby&#x27;s career-ending crash a few years earlier (see above). In fact, many worried fans wondered if the younger Allison&#x27;s career was over.

Davey arrived at Talladega the following week wearing dark shades to hide eyes severely bruised in the Pocono crash, Allison famously told a reporter asking to see his eyes at the press conference, &quot;You can see it, but its ugly.&quot; His arm was in a cast that allowed him to drive, and velcro attachments to his glove and the car&#x27;s shifter knob helped him drive with less exertion, but Bobby Hillin Jr. would relieve Davey after the initial laps of the DieHard 500. Under NASCAR rules, the driver who takes the green flag is the one assigned to the points for all drivers that drive that car during the race. Hillin drove the No. 28 Texaco-Havoline Ford Thunderbird to a third-place finish at Talladega, helping Davey and the team keep pace with Elliott. The team was a strong contender for the win until suffering a jack failure on a pit stop. The following week, veteran road racer Dorsey Schroeder would relieve Allison, but he could only manage a 20th-place finish.

With his body healed enough to allow him to drive an entire race, Davey headed to Michigan where he had dominated the track&#x27;s earlier event. But tragedy struck as the Michigan events began. While practicing for the weekend&#x27;s Busch Series race, Davey&#x27;s younger brother, Clifford crashed hard in the third and fourth turns of Michigan International Speedway. He would die en route to the hospital. Davey drove to a fifth-place finish in the Champion Spark Plug 400, then went home to Hueytown for Clifford&#x27;s funeral. The following weekend, he crashed again at Bristol, finishing 30th. Although still in second place in the Winston Cup standings, he now trailed leader Bill Elliott by 109 points.

Davey&#x27;s chance to win the Winston Million was up next as the series headed to Darlington for the Mountain Dew Southern 500, which was worth both a million dollar bonus if he could win the Small Slam, but moreover, become the fourth driver to win the Career Grand Slam. There was a promotion for the event as fake Million Dollar Bills were printed with Allison&#x27;s face on them were handed out for fans. Davey led 72 laps of the event and was in contention to win, but soon after the leaders pitted for tires and fuel, rain halted the race with 69 laps left. Instead it was Darrell Waltrip, gambling that the rains would come, did not pit and was leading the race when it was red flagged. He was declared the winner as darkness fell and the rains continued. Waltrip, who had long feuded with the entire Allison clan (Bobby and Donnie; ironically, Waltrip had replaced Donnie Allison with the DiGard team in 1975 and was a relief driver for one of Donnie&#x27;s wins at Talladega), sat next to his car on pit road in lawn chair and held a colorful umbrella, gleefully joking that the rain shower was worth &quot;one million dollars&quot; to him as he became the fourth driver to finish a Career Grand Slam. (This was the second time Waltrip prevented a driver from clinching a Small Slam; in 1985, he stopped Bill Elliott&#x27;s 1985 run at a Small Slam at Charlotte and Elliott has yet to win that leg of the Grand Slam; Elliott would take the Small Slam at Darlington in September; Dale Earnhardt stopped Waltrip&#x27;s Small Slam and Career Grand Slam attempt three years previously at Darlington.) Davey finished fifth and was now 119 points behind Elliott, who finished third.

Allison and Elliott continued their drive for the championship after Darlington as the two kept pace with each other. But beginning with the Goody&#x27;s 500 at Martinsville on September 28, Elliott&#x27;s hold on the points lead began to slip. He finished 30th in that event while Allison finished 16th. Then at North Wilkesboro, Allison posted an 11th-place finish, while Elliott finished 26th. Back at Charlotte, Allison finished a 19th, but Elliott finished 30th and there were now four drivers within 100 points of Elliott...Allison, Alan Kulwicki, Mark Martin, and Harry Gant. Martin and Kulwicki finished first and second respectively at Charlotte, and Kulwicki was continuing a late season charge. Three races prior to Charlotte, Kulwicki had crashed and finished 34th at Dover leaving him 278 points behind Elliott and in fourth place in the standings.

Elliott&#x27;s skid stopped temporarily at Rockingham where he finished fourth. Davey finished 10th and Kulwicki 12th and entering the final two races of the 1992 season, Davey was 70 points behind Elliott in second, with Kulwicki 85 points behind in third. But Davey&#x27;s fortunes changed dramatically at Phoenix as he won the event by beating his closest rivals off of pit road, and Elliott finished 31st. Davey now had the points lead for the first time since his violent Pocono crash, and was 30 points ahead of Kulwicki, and 40 ahead of Elliott, who had slipped to third in the standings. Also in contention to win the championship as the series moved to the final race at Atlanta were Harry Gant (fourth place, 97 points behind), Kyle Petty (fifth place, 98 points behind), and Mark Martin (sixth place, 113 points behind).

The 1992 Hooters 500 would be a milestone race in NASCAR Winston Cup history. It would be the final race of Richard Petty&#x27;s career, as well as the first for future Winston Cup Champion Jeff Gordon. Couple that with the closest championship race in history, and the race was destined to be a classic. Davey Allison entered the race needing only to finish fifth or better to win the Winston Cup. A first lap incident involving Rick Mast caused minor damage to Davey&#x27;s car, and he battled through much of the race to stay in the top ten.

Meanwhile, Elliott and Kulwicki were staging a battle for the ages, battling for and swapping the lead through much of the event. Late in the race, Davey had finally managed to reach the top five and was in position to win the championship when Ernie Irvan lost control of his car on the frontstretch on lap 286. Davey could not avoid Irvan&#x27;s spinning car and plowed into the No. 4 Kodak Chevrolet Lumina. Allison&#x27;s tumultuous 1992 season was over, his championship hopes lost as Elliott and Kulwicki finished first and second in the race respectively. Kulwicki, an independent driver who had turned down offers to drive for other teams, including Junior Johnson, won the championship by leading one more lap than Elliott (103 to 102).

=== 1993 ===

Though 1992 had been a heartbreaking year for Davey Allison and the Robert Yates Racing team in more ways than one, they had to be encouraged by their run for the championship. But 1993 opened on a sour note with Allison finishing 28th at Daytona. That finish was followed by a 16th at Rockingham, but Davey rebounded to win at Richmond the following week. The next race at Atlanta was delayed a week by a blizzard that blanketed much of the Southeast. Morgan Shepherd won the race and Davey finished 13th. He then posted an 11th at Darlington. Despite the early season struggles, Davey was sixth in the Winston Cup standings, while defending series champ Kulwicki was ninth.

Davey Allison had debuted in the International Race of Champions (IROC) in 1992, but his injuries forced him to miss the last two races.

Three days after Kulwicki&#x27;s death in an airplane crash, Davey Allison finished fifth in an emotional race at Bristol. He followed that finish with a fourth at North Wilkesboro, second at Martinsville, seventh at Talladega, and 15th at Sears Point. He finished a 30th in the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, but rebounded at Dover, finishing third. He was sixth at Pocono, but finished 35th at Michigan and 31st at Daytona. Halfway through the 1993 season, Davey was fifth in the point standings, but was 323 points behind leader Dale Earnhardt. Still, Davey and the Robert Yates team were confident that they could put their early season struggles and inconsistency behind them and could make a run for the championship in the second half. The inaugural race at New Hampshire International Speedway proved the team&#x27;s optimism was not unfounded. Davey led 38 laps of the event and finished third behind Rusty Wallace and Mark Martin.

==Death==

On July 12, 1993, Allison boarded his newly acquired Hughes 369HS helicopter to fly to Talladega Superspeedway to watch family friend Neil Bonnett and his son David Bonnett test a car for David&#x27;s Busch Series debut. Hut Stricklin was to have flown with him but he was recovering from being unwell at New Hampshire. Instead Davey picked up family friend and racer Red Farmer en route to the track. Allison was attempting to land the helicopter inside a fenced-in area of the track infield when the craft nosed up suddenly, then crashed. Neil Bonnett freed Farmer from the wreckage, but Allison was unresponsive and could not be freed until paramedics arrived. Farmer went on to a lengthy but successful recovery, but Allison never regained consciousness after sustaining a critical head injury. He was pronounced dead at 7:00 a.m. the next morning by a neurosurgeon at Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Birmingham after a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain proved unsuccessful.

In January 1994, Allison&#x27;s estate filed a lawsuit against McDonnell Douglas claiming the cause of the crash was a failure of the collective socket on the helicopter. The lawsuit sought $25 million and was filed on behalf of Davey Allison Racing Enterprises, Tommy Allison as Executor of Davey Allison&#x27;s estate, and Red Farmer. Birmingham attorney Jim Thompson presented evidence from a metallurgist showing that the cast metal piece contained air pockets and paint inside the part, claiming &quot;that meant the part was defective the day it left the factory.&quot; A test pilot reconstruction showed identical results to Allison&#x27;s crash. The suit called the socket a &quot;totally failed magnesium part.&quot;

In their March 1995 report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) blamed the crash on Allison&#x27;s inexperience in helicopters, coupled with the decision to attempt a downwind landing. It blamed the crash on a &quot;poor in-flight decision to land downwind in a confined area that was surrounded by high obstructions&quot; The board also listed Allison&#x27;s &quot;failure to properly compensate for the tailwind condition&quot; as a likely crash cause. Furthermore, NTSB investigator Rolf Sasser said, &quot;there was no indication of failure of that socket prior to the accident. There was no evidence of any fatigue failure. In fact, the failure of that socket would not be consistent with the loss of control that we found and witnesses stated that occurred.&quot;

In August 1995, a judge ruled against the Allison estate in their lawsuit against McDonnell-Douglas. The cause of the accident was not established and not considered important to the outcome of the case. The judge&#x27;s ruling was based upon the evidence that shoulder harnesses that came in the helicopter from the manufacturer had been removed at some point. Testimony from a biomechanics expert established that Allison would not have died, and Farmer would not have sustained his injuries, had they been wearing shoulder harnesses originally provided in the helicopter, relieving the manufacturer of liability.

In a 2003 interview, Jim Thompson said McDonnell-Douglas settled the suit in 1996 for an undisclosed amount without admitting fault. Both Thompson and attorneys for McDonnell-Douglas stated they were prohibited by the court from discussing the settlement.

Thousands packed the auditorium at St. Aloysius Church in Bessemer, Alabama, to pay their respects at his funeral. His organs except his corneas were donated. Allison was buried wearing one of his black Texaco firesuits and wearing a racing hat. Fellow drivers attending the funeral included Mario Andretti, Roger Penske, Mark Martin, Darrell Waltrip, and Bill Elliott. Governor Jim Folsom Jr. made a brief visit and ordered the flags in Alabama lowered to half-mast. Some members of the band Aerosmith attended the service at St. Aloysius. Police estimated 2,000 people attended the funeral service. The procession of cars on the way to the cemetery stretched five miles long. People parked their cars on Interstate 20 and stood on the highway overpass to watch the procession. He is buried near his brother, Clifford, in Bessemer&#x27;s Highland Memorial Gardens. Four jet fighters flew over the cemetery in formation. At the gravesite, country singer Joe Diffie performed his song Ships That Don&#x27;t Come In, Allison&#x27;s favorite song.

Journalist Paul Finebaum compared the large-scale mourning done by Alabama to the death of Bear Bryant in 1983. &quot;Not since that sad week a decade ago has this state responded to a tragedy in such an overwhelming fashion.&quot;

After the final race of the season, series champion Dale Earnhardt and race winner Rusty Wallace drove a side-by-side Polish Victory Lap carrying flags for fallen drivers Alan Kulwicki and Allison. In his short NASCAR Winston Cup career, Allison posted 19 wins, 66 top-five finishes, and 92 top-ten finishes. He also won 14 poles and earned $6,724,174. He was survived by his wife, Liz, and two children: daughter Krista Marie and son Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Grey.

==Tribute==

Ten years after Allison&#x27;s first win, Texaco debuted the throwback Battlestar paint scheme in his memory. It ran two races, but in the second, at the 1997 DieHard 500 in October, Ernie Irvan put the throwback Battlestar on the pole. Later, Texaco would often use the throwback paint scheme for their drivers at the track until they discontinued sponsorship.

The R. K. Allen Oil Company, the Talladega-based distributor for Texaco in the area, remembered the legacy of Allison with the Talladega-Texaco Walk of Fame in Talladega, where fans vote drivers, past and present, to a specially themed &quot;hall of fame&quot; for drivers. The event took place until 2013.

City manager Seddrick Hill of Talladega reinstated the Walk of Fame in 2022.

===Talladega Walk of Fame members===
Note: From 1994 to 2003, two drivers were inducted in the inactive driver category. From 2003 to 2012, one inactive driver was voted, unlike the past. Since 2013, the Talladega Walk of Fame Board of Directors has nominated one driver when necessary. The Board of Directors also inducted an active driver in 2000.
Notes

*The Walk of Fame induction was moved from July to October in 1997, and was in September in 2003.
*Hamilton was voted by fans to the Walk of Fame in 2000; the Board of Directors did not want the retiring Waltrip, whose 84 wins was the most by a driver who started his career after 1972 (when the schedule was reduced to the current format) to be inducted as an inactive driver, so he was automatically inducted by the board. It should be known Waltrip was very unpopular at Talladega in his prime for his feuds with all three Allisons, starting when he replaced Donnie in the DiGard racing car in 1975; ironically, it was Waltrip who was a relief driver driving when Donnie won the 1977 Talladega 500. Also, Waltrip&#x27;s associate sponsor was the Havoline brand of oil from 1993 to 1997 (co-branding with Sears) and again in 1999-2000 (Texaco was associated with Kmart-sponsored cars fielded by Carl Haas, with both Newman-Haas Racing in CART and Haas-Carter Racing in 2000). In the 2010s, Waltrip&#x27;s daughter Sarah Kaitlin graduated from Samford University in the Birmingham area; coincidentally, Davey Allison&#x27;s widow and children moved shortly after his death to the Nashville area where Waltrip lives, where son Robert Grey graduated from Middle Tennessee State University.
*The Board of Directors of the Talladega-Texaco Walk of Fame inducted the inaugural class by decree in 1994.

==Legacy==

Allison was leading the IROC series championship at the time of his death, with one race remaining in the four race series. Terry Labonte drove the final race in place of Allison and secured the championship for him. His championship money, $175,000, was set up as a trust fund for his children. Allison finished 31st in the final 1993 NASCAR Championship Standings and earned officially half of the 1993 owner points fund for the #28 team.

Racing Champions produced a die-cast model of Allison&#x27;s 1989 Texaco car as a tribute after his death, as well as his standard 1993 scheme in the main line of die-cast. Racing Champions also made die-cast replicas of cars Allison drove during his career in the Racing Champions Premier line, with a trading card that read &quot;Champion Forever&quot;. A promotional die-cast 28 car was released with Allison&#x27;s replacement, Ernie Irvan listed as driver to pay tribute to the team&#x27;s win at Martinsville in the fall of 1993. Only 20,000 of them were released.

Allison was posthumously inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1998, and in 2018 he was announced as an inductee of the NASCAR Hall of Fame where he was formally inducted in 2019.

Allison became a figure in a controversy as his widow became involved with country music star Joe Diffie shortly after Allison&#x27;s death. Tabloid television programs and newspapers gave much coverage to the story at the time, with some claiming that the two had been lovers before Allison&#x27;s death. Liz has openly discussed her relationship with Diffie, most recently on the Paul Finebaum Radio Network during the week of the 2006 race at Talladega. Liz expressed some regret over the relationship and mentioned that she and Diffie were band-aids for each other, and band aids were not meant to be permanent.

Liz Allison and their two children moved to Nashville and she married physical therapist Ryan Hackett on May 13, 2000. After being divorced for four years, Bobby and Judy Allison reunited at the wedding, after nearly seven years of tragedy had separated them.

On April 28, 2003, the mayor of Hueytown, Alabama, declared it Davey Allison Day and is celebrated on the weekend of the springtime Talladega race.

Due to Allison&#x27;s death, Robert Yates initially chose not to field a car at the 1993 Miller Genuine Draft 400, stating &quot;It&#x27;s hard to race with tears in your eyes&quot;. Yates would return to Talladega with Robby Gordon replacing Allison in the No. 28, but he lost control of the Texaco/Havoline Ford early in the race and crashed and finished last. Lake Speed would take over driving duties until the 1993 Southern 500. Ernie Irvan, would later take over the ride at the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and won the Goody&#x27;s 500 at Martinsville Speedway and it was a heartwarming time for Irvan&#x27;s crew as it marked their first time back to victory lane since Allison&#x27;s death. Irvan would also win the Mello Yello 500 at Charlotte as well. Racing Champions ran the No. 28 Havoline Ford with Ernie Irvan replacing Allison as the driver in tribute of the win.

Allison also had his own brand of chili by Bunker Hill with his face on the can. Allison also had a comic book printed about him during his racing days.

A road called &quot;Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive&quot; in his hometown is honored by him, along with fellow native Neil Bonnett, who died a year after Davey.

In the videogames &quot;NASCAR 99&quot;, &quot;NASCAR 2000&quot; and &quot;NASCAR Rumble&quot;, he appears as an unlockable NASCAR Legend with his Texaco Ford that he drove from 1987 to 1989.

Allison&#x27;s livery style has been used as tributes by Ford (Robert Yates NASCAR Hall of Fame), Dr. Pepper / 7 Up Group (an associate sponsor of Allison in 1992 and 93), and Chevron (at least two occasions, primarily at Talladega, the Battlestar livery has been used as a retro livery). Most notably, Irvan put the 1987 Battlestar livery on the pole at the October 1997 Talladega race, much to the delight of fans.

In the 2021 GEICO 500, Joey Gase and his Rick Ware Racing No. 53 team would run a tribute scheme for Davey Allison. The car started 35th and finished 34th.

<text>Anthony Marc Shalhoub ( ; born October 9, 1953) is an American actor. His breakout role was as Antonio Scarpacci on the sitcom &quot;Wings&quot; from 1991 to 1997. He later starred as Adrian Monk in the USA Network series &quot;Monk&quot; from 2002 to 2009, winning three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. For his supporting role as Abe Weissman on Amazon&#x27;s &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

Shalhoub has had a successful film career, with roles in films such as &quot;Quick Change&quot; (1990), &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991), &quot;Big Night&quot; (1996), &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Paulie&quot; (1998), &quot;The Siege&quot; (1998), &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (1999), &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (all 2001). He has also provided voice work for the &quot;Cars&quot; franchise, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2014), and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; (2016). For his work on Broadway, Shalhoub won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance as Tewfiq Zakaria in &quot;The Band&#x27;s Visit&quot; in 2018. Other Tony-nominated roles were in &quot;Conversations with My Father&quot; in 1992, &quot;Golden Boy&quot; in 2013, and &quot;Act One&quot; in 2014.

==Early life and education==
Anthony Marc Shalhoub (), the ninth of ten children, was born and raised in a Lebanese Christian household in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The family lived in Doty Street, and Shalhoub&#x27;s mother kept the large family harmonious despite the chaos. Shalhoub described his mother as &quot;funny and nutty&quot; and said she wouldn&#x27;t allow Shalhoub and his siblings to express anger. Shalhoub attributed his therapy as an adult to that emotional restriction but has stated that it enabled him to play calm and relaxed roles in his career. 

His father, Joseph (1912–1991), was from Zahle, Lebanon while it was still part of the Ottoman Empire and immigrated to the United States as a child after his own parents, Milhem and Mariam, died during World War I. After immigrating to America, Joe Shalhoub became a meat peddler who drove a refrigerated truck. 

Joe married Shalhoub&#x27;s mother, Helen Seroogy (1910–1983), a Lebanese American. The two met when Joe was taken in to be raised by her family, when both were young. The Seroogy family operated a candy store that remains a family business. One of Shalhoub&#x27;s maternal great-great-grandfathers, Abdul Naimy, although Lebanese, was reportedly killed by being crucified in 1895 during the Hamidian massacres committed against Christian Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. 

Shalhoub was introduced to acting by an older sister, who put his name forward to be an extra in a high-school production of &quot;The King and I&quot;. After graduating from Green Bay East High School, he spent a short time at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay before participating in the National Student Exchange to the University of Southern Maine where he later transferred and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He later went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree from the Yale School of Drama in 1980.

==Career==
=== 1980–2001: Rise to prominence and &quot;Wings&quot; ===
Shortly after graduating from Yale, Shalhoub moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he spent four seasons with the American Repertory Theater before heading to New York City, where he found work waiting tables. He made his Broadway debut in the 1985 Rita Moreno/Sally Struthers production of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; and was nominated for a 1992 Tony Award for his featured role in &quot;Conversations with My Father&quot;. Shalhoub met his wife, actress Brooke Adams, when they co-starred on Broadway in &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;. In 1998, Shalhoub starred in The Classic Stage Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; alongside John Turturro and Christopher Lloyd.

After playing several small television and film roles Shalhoub landed the role of cab driver Antonio Scarpacci in the NBC sitcom &quot;Wings&quot; which he played from 1991 to 1997. Shalhoub was pleasantly surprised to land the role after having a guest appearance as a waiter in the second season. He became a regular in the third season. The character&#x27;s name was kept, but the character&#x27;s occupation changed to a cab driver. He affected an Italian accent for the role. Shalhoub played the role from 1991 until the series ended in 1997.

Shalhoub also made guest appearances on other shows. In 1995, he played the lead role of physicist Dr. Chester Ray Banton in &quot;The X-Files&quot; second-season episode &quot;Soft Light&quot;, the first episode written by Vince Gilligan. The following year, he had a role in the hit NBC sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; in the episode &quot;The Focus Group&quot; as an Arab newsstand owner named Manu Habbib. His first two voiceover credits were as Emir in one episode of the Disney animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1995), and Aradesh in the original &quot;Fallout&quot; (1997) in his only non-Cars related video game credit. Film roles following his &quot;Wings&quot; breakout included an excitable producer consulted by John Turturro&#x27;s character in &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991) and a fast-talking lawyer in &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001) (both directed by the Coen brothers). Other early roles included a linguistically unidentified cabby in &quot;Quick Change&quot; (1991), a concierge in &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992), a drunken sailor in &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), a Cuban-American businessman in &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), sleazy alien pawn shop owner Jack Jeebs in the &quot;Men in Black&quot; films (1997–2002), an attorney in &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (1998), a widowed father in &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; (2001), a cameo role in the film &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), a Russian immigrant in the film &quot;Paulie&quot; (1998), and a has-been television star who falls in love with an actual space alien, in the &quot;Star Trek: TOS&quot; satire film &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (1999).

In his first major film role, Shalhoub co-starred in the film &quot;Big Night&quot; (1996), as one in a pair of Italian immigrant brothers who own a struggling ethnic restaurant. He demonstrated his dramatic range in the 1998 big-budget thriller &quot;The Siege&quot;, where he co-starred alongside Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, and Bruce Willis. His character, FBI Special Agent Frank Haddad, also a Lebanese American, suffered discrimination after terrorist attacks in New York City. He returned to series television in 1999, this time in a lead role on &quot;Stark Raving Mad&quot;, opposite Neil Patrick Harris. The show failed to attract an audience and NBC canceled the series in 2000.

=== 2002–2009: &quot;Monk&quot; and acclaim ===
After a three-year absence from the small screen, Shalhoub starred in another TV series, &quot;Monk&quot;. Airing on the USA Network, the series featured Shalhoub as Adrian Monk, a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in eight consecutive years from 2003 to 2010, winning in 2003, 2005, and 2006. He also took the Golden Globe award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2003. In May 2020, NBC&#x27;s Peacock streaming service posted a series of videos on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic, entitled the &quot;At-Home Variety Show&quot;. Among them was a &quot;Monk&quot; short entitled &quot;Mr. Monk Shelters in Place&quot;, featuring Shalhoub and his co-stars Traylor Howard, Ted Levine, and Jason Gray-Stanford, showing how their characters were coping with the pandemic.

Shalhoub returned in December 2006 to the Off-Broadway Second Stage Theatre, opposite Patricia Heaton for a run of &quot;The Scene&quot; by Theresa Rebeck. In addition to his acting work, Shalhoub, along with the Network of Arab-American Professionals and Zoom-in-Focus Productions, established The Arab-American Filmmaker Award Competition in 2005. Arab-American filmmakers submitted screenplays, and the chosen winner was flown to Hollywood to have their screenplay produced.

Shalhoub played Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Minion in the first three &quot;Spy Kids&quot; films (2001–2003). He appeared with Matthew Broderick and Alec Baldwin in the 2004 Hollywood satire &quot;The Last Shot&quot; as a gruff small-time mobster with a love for movies. In 2006, he appeared in Danny Leiner&#x27;s drama &quot;The Great New Wonderful&quot; as a psychologist in post-9/11 New York City. In 2007, he appeared in the horror film &quot;1408&quot; and on-stage off-Broadway as Charlie in &quot;The Scene&quot;. He received a 2008 Grammy nomination in the category &quot;Best Spoken Word Album for Children&quot; for his narration of &quot;The Cricket in Times Square&quot;. He provided the voice of Luigi, a 1959 Fiat 500 who runs a tire shop, in the 2006 Disney/Pixar film &quot;Cars&quot; and its 2011 and 2017 sequels, &quot;Cars 2&quot; and &quot;Cars 3&quot;, respectively, as well as 3 episodes of the short-form &quot;Cars&quot; series &quot;Tales from Radiator Springs&quot; (2013–2014) and the first episode of &quot;Cars on the Road&quot; (2022), and several video games in the franchise (2006–2011).

=== 2010–2016: Return to theatre ===
In 2010, he went to Broadway to act as Saunders in a revival version of &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot; in New York at the Music Box Theatre. He was nominated for a 2013 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play for Lincoln Center Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;Golden Boy&quot; at the Belasco Theatre. He was nominated for a 2014 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for Lincoln Center Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;Act One&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre. Shalhoub and his wife appeared in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot; in June and July 2015 in New York City. Shalhoub played Victor Kershaw in the 2013 true crime film &quot;Pain &amp; Gain&quot;. He voiced Splinter in the 2014 film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and reprised the role in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; (2016).

He starred in the musical stage adaptation of the film &quot;The Band&#x27;s Visit&quot;, in the Off-Broadway Atlantic Theatre Company production. The musical, with music and lyrics by David Yazbek and book by Itamar Moses, ran from November 11, 2016, through December 23, 2016. He reprised his role when the show moved to Broadway where it opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on November 9, 2017. For his performance, he won the 2018 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He also appeared as Walter Franz in the 2017 Broadway revival of &quot;The Price&quot;.

===2017–2023: &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;===

Shalhoub stars as Jewish-American math professor Abe Weissman, father of protagonist Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), in the Emmy-winning, Amazon-produced television comedy series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;. For his performance he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series both in 2019. Thelma Adams of &quot;TheWrap&quot; praised Abe&#x27;s character development and Shalhoub&#x27;s performance on the series, writing, &quot;Midge&#x27;s father — always intelligent, rarely self-aware — has a remarkable epiphany where he finally understands what Midge has accomplished, and how late he is to the party.&quot; Cristina Escobar of &quot;Roger Ebert.com&quot; declared, &quot;[Shalhoub] came close to stealing the show&quot;.

He played the character of Fred in the 2021 animated film, &quot;Rumble&quot;, and reprised his role as Adrian Monk in &quot;Mr. Monk&#x27;s Last Case: A Monk Movie&quot; in 2023.

==Personal life==
Shalhoub married actress Brooke Adams in 1992. They have worked together in several films, in one episode of &quot;Wings&quot;, and on &quot;BrainDead&quot;. Adams has appeared credited as a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; in five episodes of &quot;Monk&quot;—&quot;Mr. Monk and the Airplane&quot;, &quot;Mr. Monk&#x27;s 100th Case&quot;, &quot;Mr. Monk and the Kid&quot;, &quot;Mr. Monk Visits a Farm&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Monk and the Badge,&quot; as well as in &quot;Mr. Monk&#x27;s Last Case&quot;.

Shalhoub and Adams appeared on Broadway together in the 2010 revival of &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot;. At the time of their wedding, Adams had an adopted daughter, Josie Lynn (born 1989), whom Shalhoub adopted. In 1994, they adopted another daughter, Sophie (born 1993).

<text>The significand (also coefficient, sometimes argument, or more ambiguously mantissa, fraction, or characteristic) is the first (left) part of a number in scientific notation or related concepts in floating-point representation, consisting of its significant digits. For negative numbers, it does not include the initial minus sign.

Depending on the interpretation of the exponent, the significand may represent an integer or a fractional number, which may cause the term &quot;mantissa&quot; to be misleading, since the &quot;mantissa&quot; of a logarithm is always its fractional part. Although the other names mentioned are common, &quot;significand&quot; is the word used by IEEE 754, an important technical standard for floating-point arithmetic. In mathematics, the term &quot;argument&quot; may also be ambiguous, since &quot;the argument of a number&quot; sometimes refers to the length of a circular arc from 1 to a number on the unit circle in the complex plane.

==Example==

The number 123.45 can be represented as a decimal floating-point number with the integer 12345 as the significand and a 10−2 power term, also called characteristics, where −2 is the exponent (and 10 is the base). Its value is given by the following arithmetic:

: 123.45 = 12345 × 10−2.

This same value can also be represented in scientific notation with the significand 1.2345 as a fractional coefficient, and +2 as the exponent (and 10 as the base):

: 123.45 = 1.2345 × 10+2.

Schmid, however, called this representation with a significand ranging between 1.0 and 10 a &quot;modified normalized form&quot;.

For base 2, this 1.xxxx form is also called a &quot;normalized significand&quot;.

Finally, the value can be represented in the format given by the Language Independent Arithmetic standard and several programming language standards, including Ada, C, Fortran and Modula-2, as

: 123.45 = 0.12345 × 10+3.

Schmid called this representation with a significand ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 the &quot;true normalized form&quot;.

==The hidden bit in floating point==

For a normalized number, the most significant digit is always non-zero. When working in binary, this constraint uniquely determines this digit to always be 1. As such, it is not explicitly stored, being called the &quot;hidden bit&quot;.

The significand is characterized by its width in (binary) digits, and depending on the context, the hidden bit may or may not be counted toward the width. For example, the same IEEE 754 double-precision format is commonly described as having either a 53-bit significand, including the hidden bit, or a 52-bit significand, excluding the hidden bit. IEEE 754 defines the precision &quot;p&quot; to be the number of digits in the significand, including any implicit leading bit (e.g., &quot;p&quot; = 53 for the double-precision format), thus in a way independent from the encoding, and the term to express what is encoded (that is, the significand without its leading bit) is &quot;trailing significand field&quot;.

==Floating-point mantissa==

In 1914, Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced floating-point arithmetic in his &quot;Essays on Automatics&quot;, where he proposed the format &quot;n&quot;; &quot;m&quot;, showing the need for a fixed-sized significand as currently used for floating-point data.

In 1946, Arthur Burks used the terms &quot;mantissa&quot; and &quot;characteristic&quot; to describe the two parts of a floating-point number (Burks &quot;et al.&quot;) by analogy with the then-prevalent common logarithm tables: the &quot;characteristic&quot; is the integer part of the logarithm (i.e. the exponent), and the &quot;mantissa&quot; is the fractional part. The usage remains common among computer scientists today.

The term &quot;significand&quot; was introduced by George Forsythe and Cleve Moler in 1967 and is the word used in the IEEE standard as the coefficient in front of a scientific notation number discussed above. The fractional part is called the &quot;fraction&quot;.

To understand both terms, notice that in binary, 1 + mantissa ≈ significand, and the correspondence is exact when storing a power of two. This fact allows for a fast approximation of the base-2 logarithm, leading to algorithms e.g. for computing the fast square-root and fast inverse-square-root. The implicit leading 1 is nothing but the hidden bit in IEEE 754 floating point, and the bitfield storing the remainder is thus the &quot;mantissa&quot;.

However, whether or not the implicit 1 is included is a major point of confusion with both terms—and especially so with &quot;mantissa&quot;. In keeping with the original usage in the context of log tables, it should not be present.

For those contexts where 1 is considered included, William Kahan, lead creator of IEEE 754, and Donald E. Knuth, prominent computer programmer and author of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, condemn the use of &quot;mantissa&quot;. This has led to declining use of the term &quot;mantissa&quot; in &quot;all&quot; contexts. In particular, the current IEEE 754 standard does not mention it.

<doc id="419255" wikidata="Q936683" url="?curid=419255" title="Nebula Award for Best Novelette">
<text>The Nebula Award for Best Novelette is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) to a science fiction or fantasy novelette. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novelette if it is between 7,500 and 17,500 words; awards are also given out for pieces of longer lengths in the Novel and Novella categories, and for shorter lengths in the Short Story category. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration a novelette must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The Nebula Award for Best Novelette has been awarded annually since 1966. The Nebula Awards have been described as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot; and &quot;the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent&quot; of the Emmy Awards.

Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. The rules were changed to their current format in 2009. Previously, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.

During the 59 nomination years, 236 authors have had works nominated; 51 of these have won, including co-authors and ties. Ted Chiang has won three times out of three nominations, and Poul Anderson, Kelly Link, George R. R. Martin, Sarah Pinsker, and Connie Willis have each won twice out of five, two, four, six, and five nominations, respectively. One of Anderson&#x27;s nominations was under the pseudonym Michael Karageorge. Ursula K. Le Guin has the most nominations of any author with seven, including one win and not including one withdrawn nomination. James Patrick Kelly and Richard Bowes are tied for the most nominations without winning at six.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novelette was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="419258" wikidata="Q5685720" url="?curid=419258" title="Haxted Watermill">
<text>Haxted Watermill is a much-restored Grade II listed watermill in Surrey, England, close to the border with Kent, and is powered by the River Eden.

==History==
The mill was first mentioned in the will of Sir Reginald de Cobham in 1361. The western half of the current building, constructed on the foundations of the 14th Century mill, dates to about 1680 and the eastern half dates to 1797. The mill was last used to grind flour in 1919 but worked until 1945, grinding meal for local farmers. The last miller was Thomas Stanford whose family had operated the mill for the previous two centuries. Purchased by Mr Woodrow in 1949, he spent the next twenty years restoring the machinery to working order. The mill was opened as a museum of water milling and water pumping in 1966. In recent years it has operated as a bar and brasserie but is now closed. In 2016, planning permission was granted to site three shepherd huts on the adjoining site as guest accommodation for visitors to the mill.

==Machinery==

The current overshot waterwheel has a diameter of and a width of . It was installed in about 1830, but by 1972 the 72 iron buckets had failed and were replaced by fibreglass replicas. The bearing-stone for an earlier, undershot waterwheel was found during renovation and this dates to the fourteenth century. In full working order the current wheel produced about , rotating at 8 r.p.m. and driving three pairs of millstones, through gearing, at 120 r.p.m. The pit wheel and wallower are of the same date as the waterwheel, but the great spur wheel, made of oak with applewood teeth, has been dated to 1680. The mill originally operated three pairs of French burr millstones. At some stage a fourth pair was added, driven from a shaft off the crown wheel, but this was too much for the machinery and was disconnected.

<text>Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one event occurs, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called reliability theory, reliability analysis or reliability engineering in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer certain questions, such as what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?

To answer such questions, it is necessary to define &quot;lifetime&quot;. In the case of biological survival, death is unambiguous, but for mechanical reliability, failure may not be well-defined, for there may well be mechanical systems in which failure is partial, a matter of degree, or not otherwise localized in time. Even in biological problems, some events (for example, heart attack or other organ failure) may have the same ambiguity. The theory outlined below assumes well-defined events at specific times; other cases may be better treated by models which explicitly account for ambiguous events.

More generally, survival analysis involves the modelling of time to event data; in this context, death or failure is considered an &quot;event&quot; in the survival analysis literature – traditionally only a single event occurs for each subject, after which the organism or mechanism is dead or broken. &quot;Recurring event&quot; or &quot;repeated event&quot; models relax that assumption. The study of recurring events is relevant in systems reliability, and in many areas of social sciences and medical research.

==Introduction to survival analysis==

Survival analysis is used in several ways:

*To describe the survival times of members of a group 
**Life tables 
**Kaplan–Meier curves
**Survival function
**Hazard function
*To compare the survival times of two or more groups 
**Log-rank test
*To describe the effect of categorical or quantitative variables on survival
**Cox proportional hazards regression
**Parametric survival models
**Survival trees 
**Survival random forests

===Definitions of common terms in survival analysis===

The following terms are commonly used in survival analyses:

*Event: Death, disease occurrence, disease recurrence, recovery, or other experience of interest
*Time: The time from the beginning of an observation period (such as surgery or beginning treatment) to (i) an event, or (ii) end of the study, or (iii) loss of contact or withdrawal from the study.
*Censoring / Censored observation: Censoring occurs when we have some information about individual survival time, but we do not know the survival time exactly. The subject is censored in the sense that nothing is observed or known about that subject after the time of censoring. A censored subject may or may not have an event after the end of observation time.
*Survival function S(t): The probability that a subject survives longer than time t.

===Example: Acute myelogenous leukemia survival data===

This example uses the Acute Myelogenous Leukemia survival data set &quot;aml&quot; from the &quot;survival&quot; package in R. The data set is from Miller (1997) and the question is whether the standard course of chemotherapy should be extended (&#x27;maintained&#x27;) for additional cycles.

The aml data set sorted by survival time is shown in the box.
* Time is indicated by the variable &quot;time&quot;, which is the survival or censoring time
* Event (recurrence of aml cancer) is indicated by the variable &quot;status&quot;. 0= no event (censored), 1= event (recurrence)
* Treatment group: the variable &quot;x&quot; indicates if maintenance chemotherapy was given

The last observation (11), at 161 weeks, is censored. Censoring indicates that the patient did not have an event (no recurrence of aml cancer). Another subject, observation 3, was censored at 13 weeks (indicated by status=0). This subject was in the study for only 13 weeks, and the aml cancer did not recur during those 13 weeks. It is possible that this patient was enrolled near the end of the study, so that they could be observed for only 13 weeks. It is also possible that the patient was enrolled early in the study, but was lost to follow up or withdrew from the study. The table shows that other subjects were censored at 16, 28, and 45 weeks (observations 17, 6, and9 with status=0). The remaining subjects all experienced events (recurrence of aml cancer) while in the study. The question of interest is whether recurrence occurs later in maintained patients than in non-maintained patients.

====Kaplan–Meier plot for the aml data====

The survival function &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), is the probability that a subject survives longer than time &quot;t&quot;. &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is theoretically a smooth curve, but it is usually estimated using the Kaplan–Meier (KM) curve. The graph shows the KM plot for the aml data and can be interpreted as follows:

*The &quot;x&quot; axis is time, from zero (when observation began) to the last observed time point.
*The &quot;y&quot; axis is the proportion of subjects surviving. At time zero, 100% of the subjects are alive without an event.
*The solid line (similar to a staircase) shows the progression of event occurrences.
*A vertical drop indicates an event. In the aml table shown above, two subjects had events at five weeks, two had events at eight weeks, one had an event at nine weeks, and so on. These events at five weeks, eight weeks and so on are indicated by the vertical drops in the KM plot at those time points.
*At the far right end of the KM plot there is a tick mark at 161 weeks. The vertical tick mark indicates that a patient was censored at this time. In the aml data table five subjects were censored, at 13, 16, 28, 45 and 161 weeks. There are five tick marks in the KM plot, corresponding to these censored observations.

====Life table for the aml data====

A life table summarizes survival data in terms of the number of events and the proportion surviving at each event time point. The life table for the aml data, created using the Rsoftware, is shown.

The life table summarizes the events and the proportion surviving at each event time point. The columns in the life table have the following interpretation:

*time gives the time points at which events occur.
*n.risk is the number of subjects at risk immediately before the time point, t. Being &quot;at risk&quot; means that the subject has not had an event before time t, and is not censored before or at time t.
*n.event is the number of subjects who have events at time t.
*survival is the proportion surviving, as determined using the Kaplan–Meier product-limit estimate.
*std.err is the standard error of the estimated survival. The standard error of the Kaplan–Meier product-limit estimate it is calculated using Greenwood&#x27;s formula, and depends on the number at risk (n.risk in the table), the number of deaths (n.event in the table) and the proportion surviving (survival in the table).
*lower 95% CI and upper 95% CI are the lower and upper 95% confidence bounds for the proportion surviving.

====Log-rank test: Testing for differences in survival in the aml data====

The log-rank test compares the survival times of two or more groups. This example uses a log-rank test for a difference in survival in the maintained versus non-maintained treatment groups in the aml data. The graph shows KM plots for the aml data broken out by treatment group, which is indicated by the variable &quot;x&quot; in the data.

The null hypothesis for a log-rank test is that the groups have the same survival. The expected number of subjects surviving at each time point in each is adjusted for the number of subjects at risk in the groups at each event time. The log-rank test determines if the observed number of events in each group is significantly different from the expected number. The formal test is based on a chi-squared statistic. When the log-rank statistic is large, it is evidence for a difference in the survival times between the groups. The log-rank statistic approximately has a Chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, and the p-value is calculated using the Chi-squared test.

For the example data, the log-rank test for difference in survival gives a p-value of p=0.0653, indicating that the treatment groups do not differ significantly in survival, assuming an alpha level of 0.05. The sample size of 23 subjects is modest, so there is little power to detect differences between the treatment groups. The chi-squared test is based on asymptotic approximation, so the p-value should be regarded with caution for small sample sizes.

===Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression analysis===

Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank tests are most useful when the predictor variable is categorical (e.g., drug vs. placebo), or takes a small number of values (e.g., drug doses 0, 20, 50, and 100 mg/day) that can be treated as categorical. The log-rank test and KM curves don&#x27;t work easily with quantitative predictors such as gene expression, white blood count, or age. For quantitative predictor variables, an alternative method is Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Cox PH models work also with categorical predictor variables, which are encoded as {0,1} indicator or dummy variables. The log-rank test is a special case of a Cox PH analysis, and can be performed using Cox PH software.

====Example: Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for melanoma====

This example uses the melanoma data set from Dalgaard Chapter 14.
Data are in the R package ISwR. The Cox proportional hazards regression usingR gives the results shown in the box.
 

The Cox regression results are interpreted as follows.

*Sex is encoded as a numeric vector (1: female, 2: male). The Rsummary for the Cox model gives the hazard ratio (HR) for the second group relative to the first group, that is, male versus female.
*coef = 0.662 is the estimated logarithm of the hazard ratio for males versus females.
*exp(coef) = 1.94 = exp(0.662) - The log of the hazard ratio (coef= 0.662) is transformed to the hazard ratio using exp(coef). The summary for the Cox model gives the hazard ratio for the second group relative to the first group, that is, male versus female. The estimated hazard ratio of 1.94 indicates that males have higher risk of death (lower survival rates) than females, in these data.
*se(coef) = 0.265 is the standard error of the log hazard ratio.
*z = 2.5 = coef/se(coef) = 0.662/0.265. Dividing the coef by its standard error gives the z score.
*p=0.013. The p-value corresponding to z=2.5 for sex is p=0.013, indicating that there is a significant difference in survival as a function of sex.

The summary output also gives upper and lower 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratio: lower 95% bound = 1.15; upper 95% bound = 3.26.

Finally, the output gives p-values for three alternative tests for overall significance of the model:

*Likelihood ratio test = 6.15 on 1 df, p=0.0131
*Wald test = 6.24 on 1 df, p=0.0125
*Score (log-rank) test = 6.47 on 1 df, p=0.0110

These three tests are asymptotically equivalent. For large enough N, they will give similar results. For small N, they may differ somewhat. The last row, &quot;Score (logrank) test&quot; is the result for the log-rank test, with p=0.011, the same result as the log-rank test, because the log-rank test is a special case of a Cox PH regression. The Likelihood ratio test has better behavior for small sample sizes, so it is generally preferred.

====Cox model using a covariate in the melanoma data====

The Cox model extends the log-rank test by allowing the inclusion of additional covariates. This example use the melanoma data set where the predictor variables include a continuous covariate, the thickness of the tumor (variable name = &quot;thick&quot;).

In the histograms, the thickness values are positively skewed and do not have a Gaussian-like, Symmetric probability distribution. Regression models, including the Cox model, generally give more reliable results with normally-distributed variables. For this example we may use a logarithmic transform. The log of the thickness of the tumor looks to be more normally distributed, so the Cox models will use log thickness. The Cox PH analysis gives the results in the box.

The p-value for all three overall tests (likelihood, Wald, and score) are significant, indicating that the model is significant. The p-value for log(thick) is 6.9e-07, with a hazard ratio HR = exp(coef) = 2.18, indicating a strong relationship between the thickness of the tumor and increased risk of death.

By contrast, the p-value for sex is now p=0.088. The hazard ratio HR = exp(coef) = 1.58, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.934 to 2.68. Because the confidence interval for HR includes 1, these results indicate that sex makes a smaller contribution to the difference in the HR after controlling for the thickness of the tumor, and only trend toward significance. Examination of graphs of log(thickness) by sex and a t-test of log(thickness) by sex both indicate that there is a significant difference between men and women in the thickness of the tumor when they first see the clinician.

The Cox model assumes that the hazards are proportional. The proportional hazard assumption may be tested using the Rfunction cox.zph(). A p-value which is less than 0.05 indicates that the hazards are not proportional. For the melanoma data we obtain p=0.222. Hence, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of the hazards being proportional. Additional tests and graphs for examining a Cox model are described in the textbooks cited.

====Extensions to Cox models====

Cox models can be extended to deal with variations on the simple analysis. 
*Stratification. The subjects can be divided into strata, where subjects within a stratum are expected to be relatively more similar to each other than to randomly chosen subjects from other strata. The regression parameters are assumed to be the same across the strata, but a different baseline hazard may exist for each stratum. Stratification is useful for analyses using matched subjects, for dealing with patient subsets, such as different clinics, and for dealing with violations of the proportional hazard assumption.
*Time-varying covariates. Some variables, such as gender and treatment group, generally stay the same in a clinical trial. Other clinical variables, such as serum protein levels or dose of concomitant medications may change over the course of a study. Cox models may be extended for such time-varying covariates.

===Tree-structured survival models===

The Cox PH regression model is a linear model. It is similar to linear regression and logistic regression. Specifically, these methods assume that a single line, curve, plane, or surface is sufficient to separate groups (alive, dead) or to estimate a quantitative response (survival time).

In some cases alternative partitions give more accurate classification or quantitative estimates. One set of alternative methods are tree-structured survival models, including survival random forests. Tree-structured survival models may give more accurate predictions than Cox models. Examining both types of models for a given data set is a reasonable strategy.

====Example survival tree analysis====

This example of a survival tree analysis uses the Rpackage &quot;rpart&quot;. The example is based on 146 stageC prostate cancer patients in the data set stagec in rpart. Rpart and the stagec example are described in Atkinson and Therneau (1997), which is also distributed as a vignette of the rpart package.

The variables in stages are:
*pgtime: time to progression, or last follow-up free of progression
*pgstat: status at last follow-up (1=progressed, 0=censored)
*age: age at diagnosis
*eet: early endocrine therapy (1=no, 0=yes)
*ploidy: diploid/tetraploid/aneuploid DNA pattern
*g2: % of cells in G2 phase
*grade: tumor grade (1-4)
*gleason: Gleason grade (3-10)

The survival tree produced by the analysis is shown in the figure.

Each branch in the tree indicates a split on the value of a variable. For example, the root of the tree splits subjects with grade &lt; 2.5 versus subjects with grade 2.5 or greater. The terminal nodes indicate the number of subjects in the node, the number of subjects who have events, and the relative event rate compared to the root. In the node on the far left, the values 1/33 indicate that one of the 33 subjects in the node had an event, and that the relative event rate is 0.122. In the node on the far right bottom, the values 11/15 indicate that 11 of 15 subjects in the node had an event, and the relative event rate is 2.7.

====Survival random forests====

An alternative to building a single survival tree is to build many survival trees, where each tree is constructed using a sample of the data, and average the trees to predict survival. This is the method underlying the survival random forest models. Survival random forest analysis is available in the Rpackage &quot;randomForestSRC&quot;.

The randomForestSRC package includes an example survival random forest analysis using the data set pbc. This data is from the Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) trial of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984. In the example, the random forest survival model gives more accurate predictions of survival than the Cox PH model. The prediction errors are estimated by bootstrap re-sampling.

===Deep Learning survival models===

Recent advancements in deep representation learning have been extended to survival estimation. The DeepSurv model proposes to replace the log-linear parameterization of the CoxPH model with a multi-layer perceptron. Further extensions like Deep Survival Machines and Deep Cox Mixtures involve the use of latent variable mixture models to model the time-to-event distribution as a mixture of parametric or semi-parametric distributions while jointly learning representations of the input covariates. Deep learning approaches have shown superior performance especially on complex input data modalities such as images and clinical time-series.

==General formulation==
===Survival function===
The object of primary interest is the survival function, conventionally denoted &quot;S&quot;, which is defined as

formula_1
where &quot;t&quot; is some time, &quot;T&quot; is a random variable denoting the time of death, and &quot;Pr&quot; stands for probability. That is, the survival function is the probability that the time of death is later than some specified time &quot;t&quot;.
The survival function is also called the &quot;survivor function&quot; or &quot;survivorship function&quot; in problems of biological survival, and the &quot;reliability function&quot; in mechanical survival problems. In the latter case, the reliability function is denoted &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

Usually one assumes &quot;S&quot;(0) = 1, although it could be less than 1if there is the possibility of immediate death or failure.

The survival function must be non-increasing: &quot;S&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) ≤ &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) if &quot;u&quot; ≥ &quot;t&quot;. This property follows directly because &quot;T&quot;&gt;&quot;u&quot; implies &quot;T&quot;&gt;&quot;t&quot;. This reflects the notion that survival to a later age is possible only if all younger ages are attained. Given this property, the lifetime distribution function and event density (&quot;F&quot; and &quot;f&quot; below) are well-defined.

The survival function is usually assumed to approach zero as age increases without bound (i.e., &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) → 0 as &quot;t&quot; → ∞), although the limit could be greater than zero if eternal life is possible. For instance, we could apply survival analysis to a mixture of stable and unstable carbon isotopes; unstable isotopes would decay sooner or later, but the stable isotopes would last indefinitely.

===Lifetime distribution function and event density===

Related quantities are defined in terms of the survival function.

The lifetime distribution function, conventionally denoted &quot;F&quot;, is defined as the complement of the survival function,

formula_2
If &quot;F&quot; is differentiable then the derivative, which is the density function of the lifetime distribution, is conventionally denoted &quot;f&quot;,

formula_3
The function &quot;f&quot; is sometimes called the event density; it is the rate of death or failure events per unit time.

The survival function can be expressed in terms of probability distribution and probability density functions

formula_4
Similarly, a survival event density function can be defined as

formula_5
In other fields, such as statistical physics, the survival event density function is known as the first passage time density.

===Hazard function and cumulative hazard function===

The hazard function formula_6 is defined as the event rate at time formula_7 conditional on survival at time formula_8

Synonyms for &quot;hazard function&quot; in different fields include hazard rate, force of mortality (demography and actuarial science, denoted by formula_9), force of failure, or failure rate (engineering, denoted formula_10). For example, in actuarial science, formula_11 denotes rate of death for people aged formula_12, whereas in reliability engineering formula_13 denotes rate of failure of components after operation for time formula_14.

Suppose that an item has survived for a time formula_14 and we desire the probability that it will not survive for an additional time formula_16:

formula_17

Any function formula_6 is a hazard function if and only if it satisfies the following properties:

#formula_19 ,
#formula_20 .

In fact, the hazard rate is usually more informative about the underlying mechanism of failure than the other representations of a lifetime distribution.

The hazard function must be non-negative, formula_21, and its integral over formula_22 must be infinite, but is not otherwise constrained; it may be increasing or decreasing, non-monotonic, or discontinuous. An example is the bathtub curve hazard function, which is large for small values of formula_14, decreasing to some minimum, and thereafter increasing again; this can model the property of some mechanical systems to either fail soon after operation, or much later, as the system ages.

The hazard function can alternatively be represented in terms of the cumulative hazard function, conventionally denoted formula_24 or formula_25:

formula_26
so transposing signs and exponentiating

formula_27
or differentiating (with the chain rule)

formula_28
The name &quot;cumulative hazard function&quot; is derived from the fact that

formula_29
which is the &quot;accumulation&quot; of the hazard over time.

From the definition of formula_30, we see that it increases without bound as &quot;t&quot; tends to infinity (assuming that formula_31 tends to zero). This implies that formula_13 must not decrease too quickly, since, by definition, the cumulative hazard has to diverge. For example, formula_33 is not the hazard function of any survival distribution, because its integral converges to 1.

The survival function formula_31, the cumulative hazard function formula_30, the density formula_36, the hazard function formula_13, and the lifetime distribution function formula_38 are related through
formula_39

===Quantities derived from the survival distribution===

Future lifetime at a given time formula_40 is the time remaining until death, given survival to age formula_40. Thus, it is formula_42 in the present notation. The expected future lifetime is the expected value of future lifetime. The probability of death at or before age formula_43, given survival until age formula_40, is just

formula_45
Therefore, the probability density of future lifetime is

formula_46
and the expected future lifetime is

formula_47
where the second expression is obtained using integration by parts.

For formula_48, that is, at birth, this reduces to the expected lifetime.

In reliability problems, the expected lifetime is called the &quot;mean time to failure&quot;, and the expected future lifetime is called the &quot;mean residual lifetime&quot;.

As the probability of an individual surviving until age &quot;t&quot; or later is &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), by definition, the expected number of survivors at age &quot;t&quot; out of an initial population of &quot;n&quot; newborns is &quot;n&quot; × &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), assuming the same survival function for all individuals. Thus the expected proportion of survivors is &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).
If the survival of different individuals is independent, the number of survivors at age &quot;t&quot; has a binomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), and the variance of the proportion of survivors is &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) × (1-&quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;))/&quot;n&quot;.

The age at which a specified proportion of survivors remain can be found by solving the equation &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;q&quot; for &quot;t&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is the quantile in question. Typically one is interested in the median lifetime, for which &quot;q&quot; = 1/2, or other quantiles such as &quot;q&quot; = 0.90 or &quot;q&quot; = 0.99.

==Censoring==

Censoring is a form of missing data problem in which time to event is not observed for reasons such as termination of study before all recruited subjects have shown the event of interest or the subject has left the study prior to experiencing an event. Censoring is common in survival analysis.

If only the lower limit &quot;l&quot; for the true event time &quot;T&quot; is known such that &quot;T&quot; &gt; &quot;l&quot;, this is called &quot;right censoring&quot;. Right censoring will occur, for example, for those subjects whose birth date is known but who are still alive when they are lost to follow-up or when the study ends. We generally encounter right-censored data.

If the event of interest has already happened before the subject is included in the study but it is not known when it occurred, the data is said to be &quot;left-censored&quot;. When it can only be said that the event happened between two observations or examinations, this is &quot;interval censoring&quot;.

Left censoring occurs for example when a permanent tooth has already emerged prior to the start of a dental study that aims to estimate its emergence distribution. In the same study, an emergence time is interval-censored when the permanent tooth is present in the mouth at the current examination but not yet at the previous examination. Interval censoring often occurs in HIV/AIDS studies. Indeed, time to HIV seroconversion can be determined only by a laboratory assessment which is usually initiated after a visit to the physician. Then one can only conclude that HIV seroconversion has happened between two examinations. The same is true for the diagnosis of AIDS, which is based on clinical symptoms and needs to be confirmed by a medical examination.

It may also happen that subjects with a lifetime less than some threshold may not be observed at all: this is called &quot;truncation&quot;. Note that truncation is different from left censoring, since for a left censored datum, we know the subject exists, but for a truncated datum, we may be completely unaware of the subject. Truncation is also common. In a so-called &quot;delayed entry&quot; study, subjects are not observed at all until they have reached a certain age. For example, people may not be observed until they have reached the age to enter school. Any deceased subjects in the pre-school age group would be unknown. Left-truncated data are common in actuarial work for life insurance and pensions.

Left-censored data can occur when a person&#x27;s survival time becomes incomplete on the left side of the follow-up period for the person. For example, in an epidemiological example, we may monitor a patient for an infectious disorder starting from the time when he or she is tested positive for the infection. Although we may know the right-hand side of the duration of interest, we may never know the exact time of exposure to the infectious agent.

==Fitting parameters to data==

Survival models can be usefully viewed as ordinary regression models in which the response variable is time. However, computing the likelihood function (needed for fitting parameters or making other kinds of inferences) is complicated by the censoring. The likelihood function for a survival model, in the presence of censored data, is formulated as follows. By definition the likelihood function is the conditional probability of the data given the parameters of the model.
It is customary to assume that the data are independent given the parameters. Then the likelihood function is the product of the likelihood of each datum. It is convenient to partition the data into four categories: uncensored, left censored, right censored, and interval censored. These are denoted &quot;unc.&quot;, &quot;l.c.&quot;, &quot;r.c.&quot;, and &quot;i.c.&quot; in the equation below.

formula_49
For uncensored data, with formula_50 equal to the age at death, we have

formula_51
For left-censored data, such that the age at death is known to be less than formula_50, we have

formula_53
For right-censored data, such that the age at death is known to be greater than formula_50, we have

formula_55
For an interval censored datum, such that the age at death is known to be less than formula_56 and greater than formula_57, we have

formula_58
An important application where interval-censored data arises is current status data, where an event formula_59 is known not to have occurred before an observation time and to have occurred before the next observation time.

==Non-parametric estimation==

The Kaplan–Meier estimator can be used to estimate the survival function. The Nelson–Aalen estimator can be used to provide a non-parametric estimate of the cumulative hazard rate function. These estimators require lifetime data. Periodic case (cohort) and death (and recovery) counts are statistically sufficient to make nonparametric maximum likelihood and least squares estimates of survival functions, without lifetime data.

== Discrete-time survival models ==
While many parametric models assume a continuous-time, discrete-time survival models can be mapped to a binary classification problem. In a discrete-time survival model the survival period is artificially resampled in intervals where for each interval a binary target indicator is recorded if the event takes place in a certain time horizon. If a binary classifier (potentially enhanced with a different likelihood to take more structure of the problem into account) is calibrated, then the classifier score is the hazard function (i.e. the conditional probability of failure).
Discrete-time survival models are connected to empirical likelihood.

== Goodness of fit==
The goodness of fit of survival models can be assessed using scoring rules.

==Computer software for survival analysis==

The textbook by Kleinbaum has examples of survival analyses using SAS, R, and other packages. The textbooks by Brostrom, Dalgaard
and Tableman and Kim
give examples of survival analyses using R (or using S, and which run in R).

<doc id="419260" wikidata="Q335864" url="?curid=419260" title="David Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes">
<text>David Michael Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes, (born 14 April 1940) is a retired Anglican bishop. He was the Bishop of Wakefield between 1985 and 1991 and the Bishop of London between 1991 and 1995. From 1995 to 2005, he was the Archbishop of York in the Church of England. In March 2005, he was made a life peer and therefore a member of the House of Lords; he had already sat in the house as a Lord Spiritual when he was a bishop. He retired from the Lords in April 2015. He was closeted about his sexuality for much of his ministry and even after a press conference when he outed himself, changed that story afterwards. 

==Early life and education==
Hope was born on 14 April 1940. He studied theology at the University of Nottingham, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He then entered St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford to train for ordination, and also undertook postgraduate study at Linacre College, Oxford, being awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 1965. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;The Leonine Sacramentary: a re-assessment of its nature and purpose&quot;.

==Early career==
Hope was ordained deacon in 1965 and priest in 1967. After a curacy at the Church of Saint John the Baptist, Liverpool he was Vicar of Orford from 1970 to 1973. In that year he became Principal of St Stephen&#x27;s House, an Anglo-Catholic theological college in Oxford, from 1974 until 1982. He was Vicar of All Saints, Margaret Street, an Anglo-Catholic church in the West End of London from 1982 to 1985.

Hope was nominated to become Bishop of Wakefield on 2 July 1985, consecrated as a bishop by John Habgood, Archbishop of York, on 18 October at York Minster and enthroned at Wakefield Cathedral on 29 October. He was translated to become Bishop of London with the confirmation of his election to that See on 2 July 1991 and enthroned at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 14 September. Hope was Master of the Guardians of the Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham from 1982 to 1994.

==Archbishop of York==
Having become Archbishop of York with the confirmation of his election at Lambeth Palace in September/October 1995, Hope was enthroned at York Minster on 8 December 1995. After Peter Tatchell alleged in the same year that Hope was gay as part of a much criticised OutRage! &quot;outing&quot; campaign, Hope had said that his sexuality is &quot;a grey area&quot;. &quot;He said that his sexuality was &#x27;ambiguous&#x27; and that he was celibate.&quot; On 26 October 1995 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO), an honour in the personal gift of the Queen. Hope was one of four English bishops who declined to sign the Cambridge Accord, an attempt in 1999 to find agreement on affirming certain human rights of homosexuals, notwithstanding differences within the church on the morality of homosexual behaviour. On 30 June 2004, together with Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, and on behalf of all 114 Anglican bishops, he wrote to Tony Blair expressing deep concern about government policy and criticising the coalition troops&#x27; conduct in Iraq. The letter cited the abuse of Iraqi detainees, which was described as having been &quot;deeply damaging&quot;, and stated that the government&#x27;s apparent double standards &quot;diminish the credibility of western governments&quot;. Hope conducted a series of disciplinary hearings involving errant clergy within his province.

On 1 August 2004 it was announced that Hope would step down as Archbishop of York to become a parish priest at St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He did so on 28 February 2005.

==Later years==
In recognition of his contribution to the church, Downing Street announced on 25 January 2005 that Hope was to be created a life peer; the title was gazetted as Baron Hope of Thornes, &quot;of Thornes in the County of West Yorkshire&quot;, on 6 April 2005 (dated 31 March 2005). On 4 August 2006 he was appointed to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved for a period of five years. On 10 September 2006, Hope announced his resignation as Vicar of St Margaret&#x27;s, Ilkley, owing to ill health. He stated that he intended to continue to work a three-day week at St Margaret&#x27;s until the end of 2006, but after that would serve as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford (and later in the successor Diocese of Leeds.) On 1 October 2007 it was announced that he would also serve as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe; that licence lapsed in 2012. Hope has also been an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Blackburn since 2008.

In April 2013, it was reported that in 1999 and 2003, Hope had been made aware of allegations of child sexual abuse against a former Dean of Manchester, Robert Waddington. Hope removed Waddington&#x27;s right to officiate at services but did not refer Waddington to the authorities because of his ill health. Following the 2014 report of the Cahill Inquiry, Hope resigned his post as honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of West Yorkshire and the Dales on 27 October 2014. He retired from the House of Lords on 30 April 2015.

He was present at the Accession Council which proclaimed King Charles III as Monarch on 10 September 2022.

<doc id="419266" wikidata="Q888441" url="?curid=419266" title="Bobby Allison">
<text>Robert Arthur Allison (December 3, 1937 – November 9, 2024) was an American professional stock car racing driver and owner. Allison was the founder of the Alabama Gang, a group of drivers based in Hueytown, Alabama, where there were abundant short tracks with high purses. Allison raced competitively in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1961 to 1988, while regularly competing in short track events throughout his career. He also raced in IndyCar, Trans-Am, and Can-Am. Named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 greatest drivers and a member of the NASCAR Hall of Fame, he was the 1983 Winston Cup champion and won the Daytona 500 in 1978, 1982, and 1988.

His brother Donnie Allison was also a prominent driver, as were his two sons, Clifford and Davey Allison. Bobby and Donnie&#x27;s televised fistfight with Cale Yarborough at the 1979 Daytona 500 has been credited with exposing NASCAR to a nationwide audience. Allison was unusual for competing successfully with his own, low-budget team for much of his career.

==Early life==
Allison was born December 3, 1937, in Miami, Florida. He entered his first race as a senior at Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame High School in Miami. Since he was only 17, he had to have his parents&#x27; permission to compete. When his mother approved, Allison assumed it was permanent, but his mother believed it was for only one race. After he graduated from high school in 1955, Allison&#x27;s mother thought she would derail his racing interest by sending him to Wisconsin to work for Mercury Outboard Motors, where her brother-in-law, Jimmy Hallett, was the national sales manager. Unbeknownst to her, the owner of Mercury was Carl Kiekhaefer, who also owned race cars. Allison began working as a mechanic and an engine tester. While employed at Mercury, Allison worked in the boat division for 10 months, then was transferred to the racing division. During the two months he worked in the racing division for Kiekhaefer, he went to 19 races, mostly Grand National (Known as the NASCAR Cup Series as of 2020), and a few Convertible races. Every one of those races was won by a Carl Kiekhaefer car from the shop in which he worked. Kiekhaefer was a hard person to work for and several people got fired, so Allison decided to go back to Miami only after a little over two months.

In 1956, having returned to Miami, Allison started racing again. His parents had told Allison that he could not race and live at home, so Allison came up with a fictitious name (Bob Sunderman) which was used only once as he finished well enough to make the Sunday paper. Allison&#x27;s father saw the paper and told him that if he was going to race he should do it with honor and use his own name. In 1959, Allison took his brother, Donnie, Kenny Andrews, who owned a car (whose father owned Andy Racing Wheels), and Gil Hearne, who went along as Kenny&#x27;s driver, to find more lucrative racing than was available in South Florida. Their search led them to Montgomery Motor Speedway in Montgomery, Alabama, where he was informed of a race that would take place that night in Midfield, Alabama, near Birmingham. Allison entered and finished 5th in that race, which paid more than finishing second in any race of a higher level in South Florida. He went to Montgomery the next night, winning the preliminary races, and finished 2nd in the feature, winning $400, having found his lucrative racing. The brothers returned home and Bobby convinced Red Farmer into coming back to Alabama with him. They had immediate success and began answering to the name The Alabama Gang. Allison became a well-known driver and a top star in short-track racing, earning back-to-back Modified Special titles in 1962–63, then two consecutive NASCAR National Modified championships in 1964–65.

==NASCAR career==

Allison moved full-time to the Grand National circuit in 1965 and got his first victory at Oxford Plains Speedway on July 12, 1966.

During the course of his career, Bobby Allison accumulated 85 credited victories and 1 uncredited victories, making him fourth all-time. He also won the Daytona 500 in 1978, 1982 and 1988, finishing one-two with his son, Davey Allison. In 1972 he was voted national Driver of the Year after winning ten races and taking 11 poles, including a record five straight. He was NASCAR Winston Cup Champion in 1983, winning the Driver of the Year award again while driving for DiGard Racing. The 1982 Daytona 500 was fraught with controversy that became known as &quot;Bumpergate&quot;. He also won the Firecracker 400 in 1982, making Allison the fourth driver to sweep both Sprint Cup point races at Daytona in the same year. After Allison accomplished this, no driver repeated such a feat until Jimmie Johnson did it in 2013.

Allison ran in the Indianapolis 500 twice, with a best finish of 25th in 1975. He also made two starts in the 1972 Trans-Am Series, driving a Brock Racing Enterprises (BRE) Datsun 510 in the Under 2.5 liter class; he finished third on debut at Laguna Seca. His NASCAR team owners included DiGard, Junior Johnson &amp; Associates, and Roger Penske, for whom Allison scored four of the five NASCAR wins for American Motors&#x27; Matador. The other AMC victory was accomplished by Mark Donohue also racing for Penske in 1973 at Riverside. He raced in NASCAR as a driver/owner of an AMC Matador.
Allison was involved in an accident at Talladega in May 1987, that saw his car cut down a tire, turn sideways and go airborne into the protective catch fence that separates the speedway from the grandstands. The impact, at over , tore out over 100 yards of fencing. Parts and pieces of the car went flying into the grandstand injuring several spectators. This was the same race where Bill Elliott had set the all-time qualifying record at . NASCAR then mandated smaller carburetors for the remaining 1987 events at Talladega and Daytona. The following year, NASCAR mandated restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega to keep speeds under .

Allison won the first Daytona 500 run with restrictor plates in February 1988 by a car length over his son Davey Allison, rendering him the first driver to have won the Daytona 500 both with and without restrictor plates. He is the oldest driver (50 years) ever to win the Daytona 500. Bobby and Davey Allison are the first one-two father/son finish in the Daytona 500. As a result of permanent injuries in a crash at Pocono (see below), Bobby had no memory of the final win of his career or of celebrating together with his son in victory lane.

Allison was elected to the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1993. He was elected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2011.

===Cale Yarborough fight===
Early in the 1979 Daytona 500, Bobby, his brother Donnie and rival Cale Yarborough tangled early in the race. Donnie led the second half of the race while Yarborough made up his lost laps through caution periods. By the time there were eight laps to go, Yarborough reached second place and set his eyes on passing Donnie. Bobby was two laps down and was 1/4 mile ahead of the two rivals as Yarborough and Donnie crashed on the final lap. Richard Petty went by and won the race. Bobby passed the wreckage, finished the race, and on his way back around stopped to check on his brother and make sure he wasn&#x27;t hurt. He pulled over to the wreck site to offer Donnie a ride to the garage area. Yarborough ran up to Bobby and, according to Bobby, Yarborough was yelling that Bobby was at fault and hit him in the face with his helmet—cutting his nose and his lip. Bobby climbed out and a fist-fight broke out.

This fight led to a $6,000 fine each for Yarborough and the Allison brothers. In 2000 when asked about the fist-fight Bobby said &quot;I stopped to offer Donnie a ride to the garages and Cale comes running up saying I caused the wreck. I tried to tell him he had the wrong person. And I&#x27;ve said before, I think I questioned his ancestry. He hit me in the face with his helmet and I saw blood dripping onto my shirt. I thought &#x27;If I don&#x27;t stop this I&#x27;ll be running from Cale for the rest of my life.&#x27; I climbed out and throttled him. He ran his nose into my fist several times. My story and I&#x27;m sticking to it forever. He never challenged me again. The fine surprised me, but the fact that it brought NASCAR onto the map makes it all worth every penny.&quot; To this day, Allison maintains that Yarborough was &quot;beating his face on my fist&quot;.

Donnie had a similar story to Bobby: &quot;Cale said I forced him in the mud. I did not. He wrecked himself and I was the unfortunate bystander to be in it. He and I have talked. We&#x27;re fine. We both view it as lost opportunities. After he and I talked it out and agreed to disagree, Bobby came to the crash site asking me if I wanted a ride. Somehow I don&#x27;t remember...but seconds later fists were thrown between Cale and Bobby. I tried to get into the fight and got scratched in the cheek by Cale. I later kicked him when Bobby mopped him into the mud. All of us were fined $6,000 but between Daytona 500 and this fight, today it&#x27;s worth every penny to be involved in a fight that got NASCAR on the map.&quot;

Cale Yarborough unsurprisingly has a different account of the story: &quot;If they look at the video they&#x27;ll realize I was forced in the mud by Donnie. I was going to pass Donnie and win the race but he forced me in the mud and I had no control. So hell I hit him back. If I wouldn&#x27;t finish the race neither would he. He and I had a civil talk after the wreck and we were fine until Bobby Allison climbed out of the car and began shouting at me. It went chaotic from there.&quot;

According to the three during an interview in 2012 at the NASCAR Hall of Fame, NASCAR later refunded the fines as a reward to them for bringing NASCAR into national spotlights. Allison however complains to this day that because he only made $4,000 in the race, he had his wife Judy help pay the fine (by contributing $2,000) and he was only refunded with $4,000 by officials.

==Pocono and tragedies==

On June 19, 1988, at the midpoint of the 1988 season, Allison crashed on lap 1 of the Miller High Life 500. Initially he survived a head-on hit into the outside barrier but then suddenly Jocko Maggiacomo t-boned Allison in the driver&#x27;s side of the car, nearly killing Allison. When he reached a local hospital he was initially declared dead, but subsequent medical assistance saved his life. Beginning from a vegetative state, Allison entered a rehab program. After regaining most of his memory and re-learning everyday activities, Allison prepared to attempt a comeback in the early 1990s. However, a series of tragedies led Allison to abort his comeback attempt, thus retiring from driving in NASCAR.

In 1992 his younger son, Clifford Allison, was fatally injured in a practice crash for the NASCAR Busch Series race (now Xfinity Series) at Michigan International Speedway.

Later in 1993, his son Davey was killed in a helicopter accident at Talladega Superspeedway. Three years after these tragedies, he and his wife Judy divorced. Four years after their divorce, while attending their daughter-in-law&#x27;s wedding, they reconnected. They were remarried in July 2000 and remained together until her death in 2015. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1992, and inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in May 2011, along with Lee Petty, Bud Moore, David Pearson, and Ned Jarrett.

Allison is one of ten drivers to have won what was then considered a career Grand Slam (an unofficial term) by winning the sport&#x27;s four majors: the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, the Coca-Cola 600, and the Southern 500. Only nine other drivers have accomplished this feat: Richard Petty, David Pearson, Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Buddy Baker, Kevin Harvick &amp; Denny Hamlin.

==Career wins controversy==
Officially, Allison has won 85 Cup Series races, placing him in fourth place on the all-time wins list, just one ahead of Darrell Waltrip. Unofficially, Allison may be credited with 86 wins. The controversy lies in two races: the 1971 Myers Brothers 250 held at Bowman Gray Stadium (Winston-Salem, North Carolina; win was reawarded in 2024), and the 1973 National 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. (Charlotte, North Carolina.)

===1971 Myers Brothers 250===
Due to reduced sponsorship money being given out by the &quot;Big Three&quot; automobile companies in Detroit, some Winston Cup teams chose not to enter some of the smaller prize-money races of the large 48-event season (only 14 cars entered the 1971 Space City 300), leading NASCAR to allow its &quot;minor league&quot; Grand American Series drivers (itself suffering from a massive decrease in events versus its 1970 season) to enter six of the Winston Cup races. For these races, Grand American Series &quot;pony cars&quot;, such as the Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang, and AMC Javelin, were competing against the larger Grand National Series cars, featuring the Chevrolet Chevelle, Ford Torino Talladega, Dodge Charger Daytona, and Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird.

The 1971 Myers Brothers 250 was held August 6, 1971, at Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The first car to cross the finish line after 250 laps was driven by Allison. Knowing that the pony car would handle better on the flat track of that race, and the race following at West Virginia International Speedway, Allison had chosen to race his Grand American 1970 Ford Mustang, No. 49, sponsored by Rollins Leasing, and owned by Melvin Joseph. (Joseph was the head of Dover International Speedway until his death in 2005.) As he was not racing in a Grand National car, he never received credit in that series, but was credited with a Grand American Series win.

NASCAR has had co-sanctioned races with various series in the past; in such cases, the win counts only in the series which that driver&#x27;s car was sanctioned. The driver tied with Allison in all-time Cup wins because of the dispute is involved in this incident. An Automobile Racing Club of America/Winston West combination race in College Station, Texas on March 21, 1993, was won by Darrell Waltrip, driving an ARCA entry. That win was credited as an ARCA win only, and not counted in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West (as it is currently known) win list. Likewise, when a Winston Cup driver won a Winston Cup/Winston West combination race, the win counts in Cup, not West. The Busch Series and Busch North Series also raced combination races in the past. Currently, Bristol Motor Speedway has such a race, with the Whelen Modified Tour and Whelen Southern Modified Tour. 

On October 23, 2024, NASCAR officials awarded Bobby Allison this win, bringing his win total to 85 wins, surpassing Darrell Waltrip.

===1973 National 500===
The 1973 National 500 was held October 7, 1973 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. The first three cars to cross the finish line after the scheduled 334 laps (501 miles) were driven by Cale Yarborough, Richard Petty, and Bobby Allison, in that order. Again, these facts are not disputed. What is disputed, is the legality of the first two cars&#x27; engines, recounted in Jim McLaurin&#x27;s book ”NASCAR&#x27;S Most Wanted&quot;, in the chapter “Fudgin’ With the Rules”:

:In the 1973 National 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Allison protested that the engines in winner Cale Yarborough&#x27;s and second-place Richard Petty&#x27;s cars were over-sized. NASCAR inspected all three of the top finishers, and Allison&#x27;s engine fit the cubic-displacement specs. Six hours after the inspections began, NASCAR technical director Bill Gazaway told the press that the results were being sent to headquarters in Daytona for a final decision.

:Monday afternoon NASCAR released a statement saying that, because the inspection facilities at Charlotte were inadequate, the pre-race inspection numbers would be used-when all three cars were legal and that the results would stand.

:Allison threatened both to quit and to sue. It was not until after a private meeting with NASCAR President Bill France Jr., a week later that Allison was assuaged. Speculation was that Allison had been bought off. Allison wouldn&#x27;t confirm or deny it, saying only that he had “received satisfactory restitution”. The results were never changed. 1973 was a transition year in NASCAR. Teams could run a restrictor plate-equipped 7-liter engine or a 5.9 liter engine without restrictor plates. A decade later, Petty&#x27;s over sized engine at the same race resulted in new NASCAR rules being implemented against oversized engines, including the possibility of twelve-week suspensions for the offending engine builder, driver, and car owner. 

=== 1982 Daytona 500 ===
Following his victory at Daytona, Allison&#x27;s car was inspected and was found to have lost its rear bumper, which appeared to have fallen off in a slight bump between two cars at the beginning of the race, causing a multi-car accident. Tests were performed on the car without its rear bumper and it was discovered that the car was faster and handled better without the bumper (better underside aerodynamics and over 70lbs. lighter). It has been claimed that Allison and his crew modified the bumper so that it would fall off easily at the beginning of the race. NASCAR never fined him and the victory stands. Allison and his crew denied the allegations. In the Allison biography Miracle, Allison explained that NASCAR inspectors told the DiGard crew to move the bumper on its mounting points. The team simply tack-welded the bumper back on at an acceptable position, but &quot;forgot&quot; to properly secure it.

==Car owner==

Allison drove his own cars for portions of the early 1970s, including the full 1973 season. Allison won six races as an owner-driver from 1970 to 1974. Allison also ran for his own team in 1977 after splitting with Roger Penske, with a best finish of second at Nashville.

In 1985 Allison returned to being an owner-driver after leaving DiGard Motorsports, taking his number (22) and sponsor (Miller American) with him to his new team. His best finish as an owner-driver in 1985 was a fourth-place finish at Dover. Following the 1985 season he brought his number and sponsor with him to the Stavola Brothers Racing team.

In 1990 Allison revived his team and was a car owner for numerous drivers, most notably Mike Alexander, Hut Stricklin, Jimmy Spencer, and Derrike Cope. Stricklin was Donnie Allison&#x27;s son-in-law.

The car number raced was No. 12 and sponsors included Raybestos Brakes from 1990 to 1992 and, in 1993, Meineke. Stricklin moved to the Junior Johnson &amp; Associates team halfway through 1992 and Raybestos left at the end of the year to the Stavola Brothers No. 8 team. For 1994 season, the team partnered with Ron Zook, for Cup and Busch Series. For 1995 and 1996, the team was sponsored by Mane &#x27;n Tail with Derrike Cope at the wheel. Allison was forced to close down the team due to financial problems after the 1996 season.

==Later life and death==
Allison actively promoted rail safety for the CSX &quot;Keep on Living&quot; campaign with appearances at Talladega and Daytona. On March 6, 2008, his mother, Kittie Allison, died in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the age of 101. On May 23, 2011, Bobby Allison was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

Judy Allison, Bobby&#x27;s wife of 55 years, died December 18, 2015, following complications from surgery.

Allison died in Mooresville, North Carolina, on November 9, 2024, at the age of 86. His family announced his death that same day, prior to the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship Race.

<doc id="419269" wikidata="Q610903" url="?curid=419269" title="Nebula Award for Best Short Story">
<text>The Nebula Award for Best Short Story is a literary award assigned each year by Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy short stories. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a short story if it is less than 7,500 words; awards are also given out for longer works in the categories of novel, novella, and novelette. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration a short story must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition. The Nebula Award for Best Short Story has been awarded annually since 1966. The award has been described as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot; and &quot;the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent&quot; of the Emmy Awards.

Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be a member. Works are nominated each year by members in a period around December 15 through January 31, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Soon after, members are given a month to vote on the ballot, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then reach the final ballot in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary ballot for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.

During the 59 nomination years, 239 authors have had works nominated; 46 of these have won, including co-authors. One of these authors, Lisa Tuttle, refused her award, and in 1971 no winner was chosen as &quot;no award&quot; received the highest number of votes. Harlan Ellison won three times out of eight nominations, both the highest number of wins and the highest number of nominations of any author. Ten authors have won twice, with Karen Joy Fowler at seven and Gardner Dozois at six having the next highest nomination count after Ellison. Michael Swanwick has the most nominations for short story without winning at six, and Howard Waldrop and Gene Wolfe are next with five each. No other author has been nominated more than four times.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the short story was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist. Entries with a gray background and a plus sign (+) mark a year when &quot;no award&quot; was selected as the winner.

<doc id="419270" wikidata="Q1474371" url="?curid=419270" title="Heckington Windmill">
<text>Heckington Windmill is the only eight-sailed tower windmill still standing in the United Kingdom with its sails intact.

Heckington is located between Sleaford and Boston in Lincolnshire, England. The mill stands very close to Heckington railway station, hence its name of the &#x27;Station Mill&#x27; in the 19th century. The windmill is designated a Grade I listed building.

==Construction==
It was built in 1830 for Michael Hare to plans by millwright Edward Ingledew who also built, among others, Wragby tower mill in 1831, Waltham Windmill in 1837, and the former Pickworth tower mill. The tower is of red brick, the outer walls being tarred (provided with a black bitumen paint in order to keep moisture out). It was built as a five-sailed windmill (similar to Alford Windmill) with Sutton&#x27;s single patent sails (15 feet tip-width and 12 feet heel-width) providing longitudinal shutters on both sides of the backs (36 feet in length). The mill has six storeys called &quot;floors&quot;: ground floor, meal floor, stone (stage) floor, lower bin floor, upper bin floor (hoist floor), dust or cap floor.

==History==
The five-armed sail-cross drove three pairs of stones and milled grain for over 60 years. But Hare died before August 1834, and the mill owner&#x27;s widow, Ann Hare (née Bonner) (1807-1879), was left with two young children, one a son (James b. 1831), she then married a local miller Sleightholme Nash (1769-1847) around 1836. The mill eventually passed to Joseph Nash (Sleightholme Nash&#x27;s son by an earlier marriage) who became its last miller before its destruction in 1890. A tail-wind made the sails run backwards after the destruction of the fantail by lightning leaving the cap rotating uncontrolled, blew off the entire cap with the curb smashing it with parts of the upper gear and all five sails to pieces, and destroyed the tower rim. Nash abandoned the wrecked mill.

In 1891 John Pocklington of Wyberton mill had bought the eight-sailed mill cap with gear of the 78-year-old defunct Tuxford&#x27;s mill (built in 1813 at Skirbeck by the Tuxford millwright family is an example of their fine work) for just £72 at auction in Boston without any plans (N.B. the cost of a tower windmill was £2,000 in 1830). As a condition of the deal, he had to remove all the machinery from the mill site, so he was in an urgent need for a suitable mill stump to mount the cap on, as he had no place to put his acquisition. He bought the wrecked Heckington mill, and, from 1891 until early 1892, he fitted the white onion-shaped and fantail-driven Tuxford&#x27;s Mill cap to the Heckington Mill and set it working for the following 54 years. Later he installed a large circular saw-mill in a shed on one side, also driven by wind-power using line-shafts. It was used to make elm boards for coffins. John Pocklington was successful in milling, baking, building, sawing, and farming. In that time and even up to today the mill was also called the Pocklington&#x27;s Mill.

After Pocklington&#x27;s death in 1941 the mill stopped working in 1946 for the next 40 years. The shutters (&quot;shades&quot; in Lincolnshire) were removed from the sails. In 1953 the mill came into the hands of Kesteven County Council who made the first restorations preventing the fine old mill from being dismantled and restoring it as a rare landmark. Only four of the eight sails could be installed (from the Old Bolingbroke and Wainfleet St Mary mills, ~ 22/25 miles north east of Heckington). The mill changed hands to Lincolnshire County Council and in 1986 the mill was finally restored to working order (the repairs included the construction of 192 new shades and four new sails sustained by the &quot;Friends of Heckington Mill&quot;, with the new sails cross weighing five tons. The cap&#x27;s overhang assures the fact it is from a mill with a much wider tower top. As a rare feature with post and smock mills (Dutch type mills) and common with &quot;sail windmills&quot; (with pole-shaped sailstocks and triangular sails) such as around the Mediterranean Sea) the sail-tips are linked together by steel rods or cables to prevent sagging in the sails, a probably unnecessary work with this kind of mill sails. Parts of the bigger timber wheels have iron teeth instead of wooden ones. Among the six floors the third one being the lower of the two bin floors provides two grain cleaners-a modern one driven by an electric motor and the other an old wind-driven separator. On the second floor, the stone and stage floor, there are the original three pairs of stones (two pairs of grey and one pair of French quartzite stones) and a drive down to the first floor with a fourth pair of stones. On the ground floor a fifth pair of stones was installed which could also be driven by wind if desired or rather by engine. The mill houses a mixer on the first floor and in addition an elevator from the ground floor. Due to its large sail area supplied by its eight sails and its well-winded site the mill is able to drive four pairs of millstones - now two pairs of French (quartzite) stones and two pairs of so-called Peak stones (Derbyshire sandstone) and is able to work in very light breezes, when other local mills do not. An additional dresser is used to make white flour from time to time.

The mill is run by the Heckington Windmill Trust (established in 1986). In 2014 the Trust purchased the buildings and land surrounding the windmill with help from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant. These buildings have been restored to provide an award-winning visitor centre, shop and bakehouse. The original Victorian miller&#x27;s house has been converted to a tea room and cafe. There is also a micro brewery in the old saw mill, the 8 Sail Brewery.

The windmill has a hurst frame (a set of mill stones supported by a wooden frame) which is driven by an oil engine. This allows for milling when there is no wind .

==Opening times==
The mill is open to visitors:

* Open All Year. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. 
* Extended opening from mid July to early September for summer holidays

==Eight-sailed windmills==
Heckington Windmill is the last survivor of around 12 eight-sailed windmills in England (four in Lincolnshire) including:
*Skirbeck Mill (Tuxford&#x27;s Mill), Boston, Lincolnshire (machinery and sails moved to Heckington in 1890)
*Barrington Mill, Holbeach, Lincolnshire
*Market Rasen Mill, Market Rasen, Lincolnshire 
*Preston Place Mill, Angmering, Sussex (a small multi-purpose mill for farming use)
*Old Buckenham tower windmill, Norfolk, still standing as a four-sailed mill after her damage in 1879
*Victoria Road tower mill, Diss, Norfolk; in 1880 converted into a four-sailed mill (in 1972 into a residence)
*Leach&#x27;s tower mill in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, eight-storeyed, the tallest eight-sailer ever built (now a residence).

These mills were converted into four-sailed mills, into residences, were dismantled, or still exist as ruins.

Mediterranean windmills (&quot;sail-windmills&quot;) seem to have more sails, but their sails are in fact up to six long poles (&#x27;polestocks&#x27;) forming a wheel-shaped sail-cross of 12 round sailstocks each holding one triangular sail. They do not have shutter-type or lattice-type sails (with canvas sails attached to the lattice blades) as they come with Dutch-type windmills the Heckington Windmill belongs to. Beside this there are a few post mills in Northern and Eastern Europe with six short (~ 15 ft) paddle-shaped sails, and in Finland there are some eight-sailed hollow-post windmills with a similar type of short sails.

Boyd&#x27;s Windmill, Rhode Island, USA is another example of the larger type of windmill with eight sails.

<doc id="419271" wikidata="Q678394" url="?curid=419271" title="Final Fantasy XI">
<text>also known as Final Fantasy XI Online, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), originally developed and published by Square and then published by Square Enix as the eleventh main installment of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Designed and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, it was released in Japan on May 16, 2002, for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows-based personal computers in November of that year. The game was the first MMORPG to offer cross-platform play between PlayStation 2 and Windows. It was later released for the Xbox 360 in April 2006. All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play.

The story is set in the fantasy world of Vana&#x27;diel, where player-created avatars can both compete and cooperate in a variety of objectives to develop an assortment of jobs, skills, and earn in-game item rewards. Players can undertake an array of quests and progress through the in-game hierarchy and through the major plot of the game. Since its debut in 2002, five expansion packs have been released along with six add-on scenarios. Each expansion pack and add-on brings a new major storyline to the &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; world, along with numerous areas, quests, events and item rewards.

In 2015, Square Enix released the final main scenario for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; titled &quot;Rhapsodies of Vana&#x27;diel&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; became the final active server on the PlayStation 2 online service. Support for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions was ultimately ended on March 31, 2016, leaving only the PC platform playable. A mobile client for the game was under development by Square Enix in collaboration with Korean developer Nexon, using Unreal Engine 4, but was cancelled in late 2020. A spin-off mobile game, &quot;Final Fantasy Grandmasters&quot; was released on September 30, 2015. A new, episodic story series titled &quot;The Voracious Resurgence&quot; was added to the game in 2020, concluding in June 2023. In May 2022 rumors had circulated that &quot;FFXI&quot; may soon be shutting down. Yoji Fujito released a statement noting that this was not the case and users should not worry about the services being shut down any time soon.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), and differs from previous titles in the series in several ways. Unlike the predefined main characters of previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender, facial style, hair color, body size, job, and nation allegiance. Also diverging from previous games in the series, the game takes place in a fully three-dimensional landscape with enemies freely roaming in it, allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the random encounters used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title since.

There are currently 16 public game worlds available for play, down from 32 at the game&#x27;s height, with approximately 15,000 to 20,000 players in each. A private Test Server was opened to eligible players to aid in feedback of updates in development for the game in mid-2011. The servers are named after summoned monsters from previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, such as Ifrit and Diabolos. Players have the ability to move between servers, though Square Enix charges a &quot;world transfer&quot; fee to do so. There are no region-specific or system-specific servers, and unlike most online games, players of different languages play in the same world and can interact through automatic language translation from a library of translated phrases. The game servers are run by Square Enix as part of their PlayOnline network.

===Interface===

Players have the option of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and controller to play &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. While, by default, a player using a PlayStation 2 or an Xbox 360 uses a virtual/in-game keyboard option, the player is able to use an external keyboard that is USB compatible for communication within the game. The head-up display in &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window at the bottom of the screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. &quot;Menus&quot; allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. The &quot;action command menu&quot; appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts, as well.

===Basic gameplay===
Story related gameplay in &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; consists of two major components: missions, through which the main storyline of the game is told, and quests, which do not advance the main storyline, but fill out the game&#x27;s fantasy world. Completing missions allows a player to advance in rank, which grants access to new areas, several privileges, and various other storylines. At first, a player may only complete missions for their home nation, though they are able to change allegiances later on, allowing access to other nations&#x27; storylines. Quests may be undertaken for their various rewards, or to acquire &quot;fame&quot;, which allows a character to become well-known and respected by NPCs; a higher fame rating will open up new interactions and quests with NPCs. At release, over one hundred quests were available to play and each expansion pack has added its own set of missions and quests. Players obtain in-game money known as gil by completing missions, quests and defeating Beastmen, though unlike previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, these monsters drop only small amounts. Gil can then be exchanged amongst players for goods through the Auction House, or be used to purchase items and rewards from NPCs.

Unlike some MMORPGs, there is very little focus on player versus player (PvP) combat; the game instead revolves around player versus environment (PvE). There are numerous PvE activities and events for players to partake in, including instanced activities and shared spaces activities. Some instanced events include Dynamis, Salvage, Assault and Nyzul Isle, which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players. These battle grounds give players a series of objectives to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat, generally within a certain time frame. Popular shared spaces activities include hunting Notorious Monsters, fiends that rarely appear and drop precious loot.

The only way to attack other players in PvP is to enter one on one competition activities known as &quot;Conflict&quot;. The first form of competition, called Ballista, involves players competing to score points by throwing petras into a castle-like structure known as a Rook. The second form is known as &quot;Brenner&quot;, and features a capture the flag type system.

From time to time special seasonal festivals and events are held. They last only for a set period of time and offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features and eliminating old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players to level 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione&#x27;s Day in place of Valentine&#x27;s Day, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of Easter, and the Starlight Celebration in place of Christmas.

===Battle and party system===
Battles in &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; take place in the world in which players move around, a first in the series, where battle had previously taken place in a separate screen via random encounters. The surprise of the random encounter system is achieved via aggressive monsters, who will attack players based on different factors such as sight and sound. This format would continue in future &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. Monsters within the game operate under a system of &quot;claim&quot; and &quot;&quot;. A monster is claimed the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it, whether physical, magical or ability related. With some exceptions, once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it. A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity. Players have several means at their disposal, including spells, abilities and items, to build up enmity or shed it to their advantage in battle - a factor that features heavily in group, or &quot;party&quot; play.

To defeat more powerful monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party has room for six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense that will be the main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. One of the key aspects of the battle system lies in the extreme flexibility of the party composition: unlike many other games, there are no constraints on the role (or &quot;job&quot; class) of the party members. This feature allows to tackle every fight with a wide array of different strategies, while encouraging the community to share new, creative ways of handling a certain type of enemy.

A party can expand into an alliance, with up to three parties combined, with a total of 18 players. Alliances are necessary to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, nation or territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item).

&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;″s incarnation of Limit Breaks are &quot;Weapon Skills&quot;. Physical damage given and received fills a Tactical Points (TP) bar, to a maximum of 3000. Any amount above 1000 is able to be used up by being channelled into a weapon skill. These skills vary in effect depending on job class, what weapon is equipped, how full the TP bar is, and how proficient the player is with the weapon. If partying with other players, one may use these weapon skills in succession in order to create a &quot;Skillchain&quot;. A skillchain creates additional damage after a series of weapon skills are used. Building on this even further, magic used on a skillchain at the right time will receive a boost to its damage; this is called a &quot;Magic Burst&quot;. In order to create the best possible skillchains and magic bursts, players must work together, focusing on each other&#x27;s actions and timing.

===Job system===

&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; uses the concept of changing Jobs in a similar fashion to &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, and currently has twenty-two Jobs as of the latest expansion pack in 2013. There are six &quot;standard Jobs&quot; available to choose from at the start of the game. After one standard Job has reached Level 30, the &quot;extra Jobs&quot; are accessible upon completing certain quests. Players are able to change their jobs any time from inside their house or by speaking with a Nomad Moogle. In June 2010, the long-standing level limit of 75 was incrementally increased to the higher level cap of 99, finishing in the December 2011 version update.

Jobs have a combination of unique &quot;job traits&quot;, &quot;job abilities&quot;, and magic spells, giving them a specific role within group play due to their area of expertise. Job traits are passive abilities that are always in effect, while job abilities must be activated by the player in order to come into effect. They last a limited time and have a &quot;cooldown&quot; period before they can be used again. Magic spells are available to certain jobs, and in addition to a cooldown period, they often consume MP or some form of item in order to be cast, while at the same time requiring the user to stand still. Additionally, each job has a special one-hour ability that performs an extraordinary function.

The unique system of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;″s job system is the &quot;Support Job&quot;. This system allows a player to augment their character with abilities, traits, and spells from another chosen job, at half the level of their current job. For instance, a Level 20 Warrior setting Ninja as their support job would allow them to use all Ninja abilities, traits, and spells up to that of a level 10 Ninja, while still primarily being a Level 20 Warrior. The support job system allows for job-merges never before seen in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. However, there are some exceptions to the system. One-hour abilities and other abilities deemed signature to a particular job (such as Call Wyvern for Dragoons) are restricted to being used only on the main job.

=== Crafting and hobbies ===

In addition to completing quests and missions, players can participate in several side-minigames and other activities. One such minigame is fishing, where players can measure their strength against the fish they attempt to catch. Another is clamming, where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over their bucket&#x27;s size limit. Gardening allows players to raise plants in their residence, or &quot;Mog House&quot; as it is known in the game. The raising and breeding of Chocobos was a long-requested activity enabled in the summer 2006 update. Chocobo racing began in March 2007, which allowed for the racing of player-raised Chocobos against non-player characters (NPCs). Winning racers can earn &quot;Chocobucks&quot;, which can be used to buy, for example, items that assist Chocobo breeding.

An important part of the game is the accumulation of items, especially rare ones, which allow players to create powerful weapons, armour and food. There are many ways to obtain items, such as harvesting, excavating, logging, mining, defeating monsters, and digging by using Chocobos. Square Enix attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of &quot;gil selling&quot;, or exchanging real money for in-game items. The item auction system was shut down temporarily once due to some players exploiting the system. Items can be created by consuming elemental crystals (obtained by fighting monsters) with other ingredients in a process called &quot;synthesis&quot;. Recipe results can vary widely based on the player&#x27;s skill, the quality of the player&#x27;s equipment worn, and the ingredients used. There is large speculation (though nothing evidently documented yet) about the moon phase, direction the player is facing, in-game day (every day of the week is assigned an element), and even time of day the synthesis is performed to either increase or reduce the results of the recipe.

=== Game economy ===
&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; has a largely player-based economy, with a heavy reliance on auction houses in each of the major cities of Vana&#x27;diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.

Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the Terms of Service for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion gil was removed from circulation. That July, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
The setting of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; is the world of Vana&#x27;diel, a rich world with diverse climates, ranging from northern glaciers and southern deserts, to ethereal realms and sky landmasses. Vana&#x27;diel is divided into a number of regions, which are subdivided into areas known as &quot;zones&quot;. These zones are available for exploration and consist of outdoor areas, dungeons, cities, and towns. Players are able to explore a portion of Vana&#x27;diel, including the Middle Lands, Near East, and with the release of &quot;Seekers of Adoulin&quot;, the near west. Six city states exist in the available lands, The Republic of Bastok, The Kingdom of San d&#x27;Oria, The Federation of Windurst, The Grand Duchy of Jeuno, The Empire of Aht Urhgan and the Sacred City of Adoulin. While most areas are accessible by walking, various modes of transportation, ranging from the classic &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Chocobo and airships to special spells, facilitate movement across the game world.

Ancient lore states that Vana&#x27;diel was created as a playground for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence and their cities cast to the bottom of the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana&#x27;diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana&#x27;diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore&#x27;s sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game&#x27;s main antagonists.

The events of the game are set 20 years after the Crystal War, a devastating war where the Middle Land nations of Bastok, San d&#x27;Oria and Windurst fought and defeated the Shadow Lord and his army of Beastmen. Players deal with the aftermath of this conflict in the original story, and may travel back in time to aid in the war effort with the expansion pack &quot;Wings of the Goddess&quot;. Several parallel worlds are available, such as Dynamis and Abyssea, in which the beastmen won the Crystal War and conquered the land.

=== Characters ===
&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; features five playable races known as the &quot;Enlightened Races&quot;:
;Elvaan: A race of proud warriors, the Elvaan&#x27;s home city is the Kingdom of San d&#x27;Oria. Elvaan have an unshakable pride and faith in their beliefs, and many eschew the business world, preferring an austere lifestyle as skilled sword fighters. The Elvaan race possesses high strength and mind, but low MP and intelligence. Elvaan are said to be cursed with the sin of arrogance.

;Hume: Originating from the city of Bastok, Humes are the most common race in Vana&#x27;diel and are known for their intelligence and high level of skill in numerous areas. Humes have equally balanced abilities, and are said to be cursed with the sin of apathy. They serve as the game&#x27;s human race.

;Galka: A hulking race of powerful warriors, the Galka&#x27;s capital city was destroyed by war 600 years ago. Many of the surviving Galka settled in Bastok, and are currently used by the city as cheap underclass labour. The Galka do not have a female counterpart, but reproduce through reincarnation. They possess the highest HP and vitality in the game, but also the lowest MP. The Galka are cursed with rage.

;Mithra: The Mithra are a race of hunters who live alongside the Tarutaru in Windurst. They are known for their energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.

;Tarutaru: A race of skilled magic users from the Federation of Windurst, the Tarutaru physically resemble children, however their size does not reflect their age. Tarutaru are playful yet cunning. They possess the highest MP and intelligence of all the races, but the lowest HP and strength. Tarutaru are said to be cursed with cowardice.

In addition to the playable races, there are two other non-playable Enlightened Races, known as the Zilart and the Kuluu. These ancient races were thought to be extinct, and are the focus of the first two-game expansions. There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests, missions and the game&#x27;s storylines. The game features several typical &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fiends, including Goblins, Sahagins and Tonberries. Several of these races are known as Beastmen, a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence, exhibiting self-awareness, emotions, culture, and religion. The complex relationship, bigoted views, and reasons of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game.

&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; is represented in the &quot;Dissidia&quot; game series by Shantotto, a female Tarutaru Black Mage from the Windurst storyline, voiced by famed voice actress Megumi Hayashibara in the Japanese version and Candi Milo in the English version. The game&#x27;s prequel adds Prishe, a female Elvaan from Tavnazia, who is the main character in the &quot;Chains of Promathia&quot; expansion pack.

=== Story ===
The storyline is primarily followed with missions through the governing nations that exist in the base game as well as each expansion that the player is affiliated with. Nation or governing body affiliation is relatively simple, sometimes requiring prerequisite quests being completed and have several stages of progression to achieve higher recognition and reward throughout each story. Some missions are even required to be completed to further progress into the start of the additional storylines of each expansion or specific areas.

Players begin the game as residents of one of the three main countries: San d&#x27;Oria, Bastok, and Windurst, and must help band the nations together against the resurrected Shadow Lord.

The expansion &quot;Rise of the Zilart&quot; reveals that the Crystal War and the resurrection of the Shadow Lord had been masterminded by the Zilart princes Eald&#x27;Narche and Kam&#x27;lanaut, who survived the extinction of their race. The two Zilarts plan to become Gods by opening the path to paradise, and the player is charged with thwarting their plans.

&quot;Chains of Promathia&quot; revolves around an Elvaan girl named Prishe and the dead Twilight God Promathia, who had originally cursed the Zilart race, and the attempts of various factions to either complete or stop his resurrection. The wyrmking Bahamut is involved in these events, and intends to destroy Vana&#x27;diel to prevent Promathia from absorbing the life of the world.

&quot;Treasures of Aht Urhgan&quot; concerns the Empire of Aht Urhgan which opens up to the nations of midlands after years of self-imposed isolation. As a new and powerful nation, it is of concern to the nation of the player, who is sent as a representative. The player then becomes embroiled in the intrigues of the Empress&#x27;s court and the growing fears of war and darkness coming to Aht Urhgan.

&quot;Wings of the Goddess&quot; primarily occurs in the era of the Crystal War, 20 years in the past from the main &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; setting. The player discovers and crosses mysterious time portals alongside the Hume/Elvaan mix Lilisette, and are led to help the Regal Feline Cait Sith reduce the suffering of the era. However, Lilisette and her partner encounter Lilith, an alternate timeline version of herself who wishes to keep the war going to maintain her time while negating Lilisette&#x27;s.

&quot;Seekers of Adoulin&quot; concerns the western continent archipelago of Adoulin, and the Sacred City of Adoulin. The city was a focal point for colonization 200 years before the present game, but when colonization efforts failed in the main continent of Ulbuka, the nation fell in population and shifted to trade as a focus. Now colonization has begun once again, and players are free to explore the region.

&quot;Rhapsodies of Vana&#x27;diel&quot; concerns the conclusion of the previous &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; storylines with the threat posed by the Cloud of Darkness and an alternate timeline version of the player.

&quot;The Voracious Resurgence&quot;, the follow-up story to &quot;Rhapsodies of Vana&#x27;diel&quot;, concerns the mysterious &quot;world eater eggs&quot; appearing all throughout the land of Vana&#x27;diel.

== Development ==

The idea to develop &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; as an online game was conceived by Hironobu Sakaguchi when establishing Square Pictures headquarters in Hawaii. Impressed by western MMORPGs that he discovered there, such as &quot;EverQuest&quot;, Sakaguchi convinced Square to begin the development of their own MMORPG and suggested that it be based on the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Since MMORPG creation was seen as a &quot;greater cause&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; was made by a merger of four crews: the &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot; and &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot; teams from Osaka, and the &quot;Mana&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; teams from Tokyo. Development began in November 1999. The game was the first developed under Square&#x27;s new philosophy to develop for &quot;all platforms and media&quot;. Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer of the game, said that the title is heavily influenced by &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, especially in its battle and magic systems. According to Tanaka, Square put in &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; what they could not put in the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles due to technical limitations, thus making &quot;XI&quot; the &quot;most [representative] &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; of all the episodes&quot;. The game was developed and ran on the Nvidia GeForce 4 Ti GPU, which the President of Square Yoichi Wada described as the most powerful graphics processor available at the time. The game cost two to three billion yen (~$17–25 million) to create along with the PlayOnline Network Service and was assumed to become profitable over a five-year timespan. By creating a unified game world instead of different ones balkanized by language, development costs were cut 66%. Since recurring monsters of the series are known by different names in the Japanese and English versions of the other installments, it was decided for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; to use both Japanese and English names for different varieties of the same monsters.
A simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release was originally considered, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced on January 29, 2000, at the Square Millennium Conference in Yokohama, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of &quot;Final Fantasy Online&quot; was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done four months later in December.

Following its PC release, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; was listed as one of IGN&#x27;s most anticipated PlayStation 2 games of 2004. Sony launched a multimillion-dollar ad campaign to promote the game along with the PlayStation 2 hard drive add-on which the game required. Having been released on the PlayStation 2 as well as the personal computer, it became the first cross-platform MMORPG ever created. On June 14, 2002, the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface, and a new patch for the game client. This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game. Other early issues included complaints by American players that experienced Japanese players had already completed all the quests. Square Enix responded by adding new servers in order to have game worlds with fewer expert players.

&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; is one of the first cross-console video games, and has continued to update its software to allow the game to run on new consoles. In March 2007, a patch was released to enable gameplay in French and German. Square Enix noted that Nintendo&#x27;s use of &quot;Friend Codes&quot; was the primary reason &quot;XI&quot; was not brought to the Wii. In December 2006, the PlayStation 2 versions of PlayOnline and &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; were able to install and run on the PlayStation 3. The &quot;Vana&#x27;diel Collection 2008&quot; discs for the PlayStation 2 had installation issues on the PlayStation 3, causing them to be unusable at first since they weren&#x27;t on Sony&#x27;s list of HDD compatible titles in the firmware the PlayStation 3 had at the time. This problem was fixed in December 2007 when Sony released firmware update 2.10 for the PlayStation 3. This allowed all backwards compatible models—20GB model #CECHB01, 60GB model #CECHA01 and 80GB model #CECHE01—to play &quot;XI&quot;. After working with Microsoft to resolve the game&#x27;s incompatibility issues with Windows Vista, Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the operating system, although small bugs have appeared.

In September 2010, Akihiko Matsui became the director of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. Only three months later, on December 10, Matsui left the team to work as &quot;Lead Combat System Designer&quot; on Square Enix&#x27;s new MMO, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;. His replacement as director of &quot;XI&quot; is Mizuki Ito. At one point in 2011, Square Enix considered to port &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; for Sony PlayStation Vita. On June 24, at the end of VanaFest 2012, a festival in Yokohama, Japan to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Japanese launch of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, Hiromichi Tanaka, for health reasons, decided to step down as producer of the game and leave Square-Enix. Akihiko Matsui was selected to replace him. In March 2023, Yoji Fujito replaced Matsui as the producer, while Matsui would in some form continue supporting &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;.

In 2006, between 200,000 and 300,000 active players logged in per day, with 500,000 total active players and around 150,000 online at any one time. By April 2009, the total number of active characters exceeded 2 million for the first time. By June 2012, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; became the most profitable title in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

===Music===
The music of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; was scored by Naoshi Mizuta, Kumi Tanioka, and Nobuo Uematsu. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda was also asked to contribute, but at the time he was unable to do so, as he was scoring the music for &quot;Xenosaga&quot;. The game&#x27;s five expansion packs since were scored by Mizuta alone, after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in Esperanto. According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers&#x27; hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. He also noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. It was the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square Enix employee. New music has been employed for special events, such as a holiday score titled &quot;Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-&quot; which can be heard in the city of Jeuno each mid-to-late December since 2004.

The game&#x27;s music has been released in CD form several times and has been featured in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts. Some of the game&#x27;s music has been released on iTunes, such as the vocal &quot;Distant Worlds&quot;, which was released on the Japanese iTunes store on September 13, 2005, having been put in the game in a July 2005 patch. A compilation CD box was released on March 28, 2007, titled &quot;Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box&quot;, which included the four original soundtracks from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and its three expansion sets, as well as the previously unreleased tracks from the game and the unreleased &quot;Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections&quot;. Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-, a 2004–05 concert series, featured &quot;Ronfaure&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. A ten-track album of music inspired by &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; entitled &quot;Music from the Other Side of Vana&#x27;diel&quot; was released by The Star Onions on August 24, 2005.

== Expansions and add-ons ==
&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; has additions released every few years. Expansion packs add new story, jobs, zones, quests, and content to the game, while add-ons are smaller in scale, adding a smaller selection of the aforementioned items. Until the discontinuation of the Xbox 360 and PS2 versions, all of the expansions and add-ons had been released on PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360, with the exception of &quot;Seekers of Adoulin&quot;, which did not see a PlayStation 2 release outside Japan.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 2 version 85% based on 57 reviews and 85/100 based on 49 reviews, the PC version 82% based on 44 reviews and 85/100 based on 25 reviews the Xbox 360 version 69% based on 32 reviews and 66/100 based on 25 reviews. &quot;Famitsu&quot; rated the game 38 out of 40. &quot;Computer and Video Games Magazine&quot; noted that it was one of the most welcoming MMORPGs despite the cumbersome initial registration and setup. &quot;IGN&quot; called it a well done but unoriginal game and also noted that North American players were forced to play with already much more experienced Japanese players who had already completed the game&#x27;s various quests. &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized it at release for having an unconventional control system, a lengthy installation, and having no player versus player (PvP) aspects. Other elements receiving criticism include the EXP grind, which involves constant battles to access different parts of the game, and overcrowded camp sites. The expansions have been mostly positively received, with praise for the amount of content added, but increasing signs that the graphics of the game are becoming outdated. The &quot;IGN&quot; review of the Xbox 360 release was similar, noting that it was a large amount of game content, but had a protracted setup process and elements of the game design that require a large time investment. It has also been noted that this game is the first to move in a wildly different direction while remaining in the main numbering line, as opposed to the &quot;Tactics&quot; and &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; games which became their own side series.

===Sales and subscriptions===
The user base for the PlayStation 2 version was truncated initially because of limited sales of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s hard drive and network adapters that were needed for the game. The Japanese release of &quot;Rise of the Zilart&quot; was the number one selling game when it debuted in 2003 with 90,000 copies sold in the first week. The &quot;Treasures of Aht Urhgan&quot;, released three years later, sold over 103,000 copies for the PlayStation 2 in Japan during 2006. In the United States, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;″s computer version sold 340,000 copies ($15.5 million) by August 2006, after its release in October 2003. It was the country&#x27;s 51st best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. The &quot;Final Fantasy XI All-in-One Pack&quot; was number 36 and &quot;Wings of the Goddess&quot; was number 40 on the top 50 best-selling Xbox 360 games in Japan as of December 2007. For the April–September 2004 financial period, Square Enix saw online gaming, particularly &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, sales increase by 101 percent and operating profit increase by 230.9 percent. Revenues held steady from subscription services in the summer of 2006; in the fall, however, Square acknowledged that online subscription revenues were &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, despite the steady performance of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. By December 2003, there were over 200,000 subscribers to &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, allowing the company to break even and start making a profit. There were between 200,000 and 300,000 active players daily in 2006. As of August 2006, the Xbox 360 version was the sixth most played game on Xbox Live. As of 2008, the game had 500,000 subscribers. By June 2012, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; became the most profitable title in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. While many MMOs have switched to some form of free-to-play model, the base monthly subscription price point for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; has remained the same at $11.95 since its debut in 2002.

===Awards and legacy===
&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; was awarded the grand prize from the Japan&#x27;s Consumer Entertainment Software Association (CESA) for 2002–2003 along with &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot;. It has also received GameSpy&#x27;s 2003 PC MMORPG Game of the Year Award and IGN&#x27;s Game of the Month for March 2004, citing the game&#x27;s huge customization and its successful cross-platform and cross-language game world. It received a runner-up position in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2004 &quot;Best Massively Multiplayer Online Game&quot; award category, losing to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the expansion &quot;Chains of Promathia&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Massively Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot;, ultimately losing out to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. During the following year&#x27;s awards ceremony, &quot;The Vana&#x27;diel Collection&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; was referenced in the online game &quot;Minna no Golf Online&quot; in the form of a &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;-themed lobby.

Square Enix released the second MMORPG in the series in 2010, titled &quot;Final Fantasy XIV Online&quot;.

The game has spawned several written adaptations and related merchandise. Starting in 2003, a series of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; novels was written by Miyabi Hasegawa and released in Japanese, German, and French. Additionally, in 2004, &quot;Adventure Log&quot;, a webcomic by Scott Ramsoomair, was commissioned by Square Enix starting in 2007. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; PlayOnline Visa and MasterCard credit cards were available in Japan, with features including no annual fees as long as cardholders remain PlayOnline subscribers and various other rewards. There have also been posters with limited edition phone cards and keychains released, also exclusively in Japan. Several T-shirts have been made available for order in North America, and various stuffed animals and gashapon figurines have also been made available to order of different races from the series.

<doc id="419276" wikidata="Q2427659" url="?curid=419276" title="Józef Mackiewicz">
<text>Józef Mackiewicz (1 April 1902 – 31 January 1985) was a Polish writer, novelist and political commentator; best known for his documentary novels &quot;Nie trzeba głośno mówić&quot; (One Is Not Supposed to Speak Aloud), and &quot;Droga donikąd&quot; (The Road to Nowhere). He staunchly opposed communism, referring to himself as an &quot;anticommunist by nationality&quot;. Mackiewicz died in exile. His older brother Stanisław Mackiewicz was also a writer.

==Life and career==
Józef Mackiewicz was the son of Antoni Mackiewicz and Maria née Pietraszkiewicz originally from Kraków, a Polish noble family from the Polish-Lithuanian gentry of Bożawola coat of arms. He was born on 1 April 1902 in Saint Petersburg. Józef Mackiewicz was the younger brother of Stanisław Mackiewicz, a political publicist and Prime Minister of the postwar Polish government in exile from 1954 to 1955; and Seweryna Mackiewicz, mother of Polish writer .

In 1907 his family moved to Vilnius. In 1919, as a 17-year-old volunteer he participated in the Polish–Soviet War, first, as an uhlan of the Polish Army&#x27;s 10th Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment, and then of the 13th Wilno Uhlan Regiment. He finished his military service during Poland&#x27;s fight of independence as an uhlan of the . Similar to other young veterans of the war who entered university without their Matura graduation, Mackiewicz started his favourite subject of biological sciences at the University of Warsaw and then upon moving to Vilnius continued studies at the Vilnius University, but he never graduated with a degree. From 1923 he worked as a journalist for &quot;Słowo&quot; (&quot;The Word&quot;), a periodical published in Vilnius by his older brother Stanisław and fully sponsored and financed by the old noble families of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Journalist work took him all over the Baltic republics and eastern Poland.

Mackiewicz married Antonina Kopańska with whom he had a daughter Halina, and upon divorce he was in a long-term relationship with Wanda Żyłowska, with whom he had a daughter Idalia. Then he began his lifelong relationship with a writer and journalist of Vilnius&#x27; &quot;Słowo&quot; Barbara Toporska, but they had no children. They married in 1939.

===World War II===
On 17 September 1939 Soviet troops attacked eastern Poland as part of the joint German-Soviet Invasion of Poland. Upon the division of the country by occupying forces, the Vilnius region was transferred to then independent Lithuania. On the 18th, Mackiewicz published an article expressing joy at the Bolshevik&#x27;s withdrawal from Vilnius, resulting in him being accused of anti-Polonism and pro-Lithuanianism. Mackiewicz remained in Vilnius, and between October 1939 and May 1940 he was a publisher and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Gazeta Codzienna&quot; (&quot;Daily Paper&quot;), a Polish-language an anti-nationalist and anti-Soviet daily in Lithuanian-controlled Vilnius. In his articles, he attempted to initiate a political dialogue between Lithuanians and Poles. In May 1940, he was forbidden from further roles as a publisher and journalist by the Lithuanian government.

After the 15 June 1940 invasion and annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, Mackiewicz gave up his professional activity and worked as a lumberjack and wagon driver. In June 1941, the Germans occupied Lithuania. For the first four months of the occupation, Mackiewicz again worked as a journalist for the German-issued Polish-language newspaper &quot;Goniec Codzienny&quot;, in which he published several anti-Soviet articles, and excerpts from one of his books.

In 1942, he witnessed the Ponary massacre of some 100,000 mostly Polish Jews by German SD, SS and the Lithuanian Nazi collaborators Ypatingasis būrys, which he described in his 1969 book &quot;Nie trzeba głośno mówić&quot; (One Is Not Supposed to Speak Aloud). At the end of 1942 (beginning of 1943) he was sentenced to death by the resistance for his work at &quot;Gazeta Codzienna&quot; and &quot;Goniec Codzienny&quot;. The sentence was not carried out, and later formally cancelled.

In April 1943 Mackiewicz was invited by the international Katyn Commission, headed by German occupying authorities, to the site of Katyn massacre. Upon consent of the Polish government-in-exile, he assisted in the first excavations of the mass graves of the Polish officers killed by Soviet NKVD there in 1940. Upon his return to Vilnius, the local German-sponsored daily &quot;Goniec Codzienny&quot; published an interview with Mackiewicz titled &quot;Widziałem na własne oczy&quot; (&quot;I saw with my own eyes&quot;). He later arrived in Italy where he worked for the II Corps (Poland) and, in this capacity, he edited a compilation of documents related directly to the Katyń Massacre under the title &quot;Zbrodnia katyńska w świetle dokumentów&quot; (The Katyn murder in light of new evidence), published in 1948 with an introduction by General Władysław Anders. At the same time he wrote his own book under the title &quot;Katyń. Zbrodnia bez sądu i kary&quot; (Katyn. Murder without Trial nor Sentence). Its first Polish language publication was destroyed by the publisher in London, UK, for political reasons. In 1949 he published its German language version, &quot;Katyn – ungesühntes Verbrechen&quot;, in Zürich, Switzerland. In 1951 he published the English-version of his book under a title &quot;The Katyn Wood Murders&quot;, the very first book in English on the subject (Italian version in 1954 as &quot;Il Massacro della foresta di Katyn&quot;, in Spanish in 1957 as &quot;Las Fosas de Katyn&quot;, in Russian published in Canada in 1988 as &quot;Катынь&quot;). In 1952 he testified before the US Senate Committee known as &quot;Select Committee to Investigate and Study the Facts, Evidence, and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest Massacre&quot; about the genocidal nature the Katyń Massacre (the Polish version of &quot;Katyń. Zbrodnia bez sądu i kary&quot; was published in 1997 in Poland, and again under different title: &quot;Sprawa mordu katyńskiego. Ta książka była pierwsza&quot; in 2009).

===Accusations of Collaboration with Nazi Germany===
In 1942, Mackiewicz was accused of collaboration with the Germans during the occupation due to his work as a journalist and publisher at &quot;Gazeta Codzienna&quot; and &quot;Goniec Codzienny&quot;. In these articles, Mackiewicz put forth several ideas, notably that a return to the prewar borders of Poland was a pipe-dream and not a useful premise, which some local Poles then considered unthinkable.

He also proclaimed that opposing just one invader, Germany (as did the Polish Resistance), was synonymous with helping the second invader, the Soviet Union, because their intentions were identical, but that opposing communism was more important.

During the first four months of the German occupation, Mackiewicz worked as a journalist for the Nazi-controlled Polish-language propaganda newspaper &quot;Goniec Codzienny&quot;, in which he published several anti-Soviet articles, and excerpts from his novel &quot;Droga Donikąd&quot; (The Road to Nowhere).

This work under the Nazi occupation, and skepticism of a return to pre-war Polish borders, resulted in him being sentenced to death by the Special Court of the Home Army (Polish underground resistance), however this was never carried out and later formally cancelled. The circumstances around this are unclear 

According to Czesław Miłosz, he was not a collaborator. Miłosz says that In 1947, Mackiewicz was completely cleared of any wrongdoing, and that It is open to debate how much the popular criticism of his novels was influenced by the Soviet sympathies of his adversaries.

The accusations negatively influenced the Polish perceptions of Mackiewicz and his work, especially following World War II.

==Exile==
Mackiewicz and his wife Barbara Toporska left Vilnius and lived in Warsaw until 31 July 1944, when they left for Kraków and then finally left Poland for Rome in January 1945, never to return. They first lived in Italy and he started publishing in various émigré publications like &quot;Kultura&quot; in Paris and many others. In 1948 they moved to London and he continued writing and publishing. In 1955 he and his wife Barbara Toporska moved permanently to Munich, Where he continued to write on variety of topics and also published plenty of fiction and articles. He lived on the verge of poverty, supporting himself by writing and his wife’s handicraft. Mackiewicz died in Munich on 31 January 1985, and was buried in the St Andrew Bobola Polish Church in London

==Works==
Mackiewicz&#x27;s prose is extremely realistic: he believed that there are no &quot;untouchable&quot; subjects in writing. In 1957, he published &quot;Kontra&quot;, a narrative account of the particularly brutal and treacherous handover of thousands of anti-Soviet Cossacks back to the Soviets by the British soldiers in Austria; and in 1962 &quot;Sprawa pulkownika Miasojedowa&quot; (&quot;Colonel Miasoyedov&#x27;s Case&quot;), a harshly realistic novel of the bombing of Dresden in World War II. His other best-known novels include: &quot;Droga donikąd&quot; (&quot;The Road to Nowhere&quot;), an account of life under Soviet occupation; &quot;Zwycięstwo prowokacji&quot; (&quot;Victory of Provocation&quot;) on communism; and &quot;W cieniu krzyża&quot; (&quot;In the Shadow of the Cross&quot;) on Catholicism. His voluminous output as a writer of fiction and a publicist has been undergoing a revival after many years of underground publishing and later marginal interest. His books have been published since 1972 by the KONTRA Publishing House of London, UK, owned by Nina Karsov-Szechter. In 2009 Nina Karsov-Szechter received an award of the Union of Polish Writers Abroad as the editor of works by Józef Mackiewicz.

==Popular culture==
Józef Mackiewicz is the subject of two documentaries made after his death. First was the film „Jedynie prawda jest ciekawa” (Only the truth is interesting) by Robert Kaczmarek made for Polish TV in 1996, and then in 2008 a short film „Errata do biografii – Józef Mackiewicz” (Correction to biography - Józef Mackiewicz) by Grzegorz Braun. His life and works are the subject of more than 30 scholarly works, as well as articles, websites and blogs.

<doc id="419278" wikidata="Q16205408" url="?curid=419278" title="John Bell (bishop of Worcester)">
<text>John Bell (died 11 August 1556) was a Bishop of Worcester (1539–1543), who served during the reign of Henry VIII of England.

==Education==
Bell attending Balliol College, Oxford, and later at Cambridge where he took the degree of LL.B in 1504.

==Career==
Following this advancement he was promoted to other posts:

::&quot;Canon and prebendary of the collegiate church of St. Stephen in Westminster Palace (until 1539);&quot;; 1526 Collated: Warden of the church of Stratford-Upon-Avon, Preceptor of the hospital of St.Wulstans, Magister, Bachelor of Civil law, acta capitularia (Chapter act book) Coventry &amp; Lichfield diocese 1528 Collated: Doctor of Canon law, Lincoln Cathedral, Doctor of Civil law, St. Pauls, Rector of Gloucestershire, Weston-sub-Edge, Lichfield, Southwell and St.Paul&#x27;s, Cathedrals 1529 Collated: Magister, Doctor of Civil law Gloucester, 1539 Collated: Archdeacon of Gloucester.

Wolsey, would appoint Bell to the membership of the Legantine court of audience, where in 1523, he examined William Tyndale on charges of heresy.

One such mission was to secure a religious and political relationship with the Lutheran Princes in Germany. While abroad Bell was made LL.D of some foreign university, in which his degree was incorporated at Oxford in 1531.

===King&#x27;s Great Matter===

In 1531, primarily as a result of the innovative suggestion of Thomas Cranmer, who thought the King&#x27;s position in the divorce would be strengthened by obtaining favourable opinions from the various universities in England and abroad, Henry VIII sent Dr. Bell, together with the bishop of Lincoln and Foxe, to deliver a letter that he had personally drafted and to canvass Oxford, for a favourable opinion concerning the King&#x27;s cause; of which they successfully secured despite the danger, being pelted with stones by the popish opposition, together while overcoming the strong resistance from the junior members of convocation.

In the same year he was also one of a commission including Sir Thomas More to assist the Archbishop in preparing the royal proclamation against William Tyndale&#x27;s translation of the Scriptures and a number of heretical books.

In 1532 he took part in the proceedings of the convocation which decided that the King&#x27;s marriage was contrary to divine law, and consequently that the pope&#x27;s dispensation was &quot;ultra vires&quot;, and which drew up &quot;&#x27;the articles about religion&quot;,&#x27; of which the original may be seen, with John Bell&#x27;s name attached, in the Cotton Library.

&quot;He served as proctor for the king at the trial at Dunstable Abbey [May 10–17, 1533] which definitively nullified Henry&#x27;s first marriage in time for the coronation of Anne Boleyn.&quot;

In 1537, Bell was one of the composers of the Bishop&#x27;s Book, properly entitled &quot;The Institution of the Christian Man&quot;.

===Bishopric of Worcester 1539–1543===
In 1539, John Bell succeeded Hugh Latimer as bishop of Worcester and was consecrated by Cranmer on 17 August. In the same year he was present during the baptism of Edward VI at Hampton Court. John Bell&#x27;s elevation to bishop was accompanied with a difficult managerial legacy, that followed in the wake of Latimer&#x27;s ambitious reform agenda, and Bell did what he could to restore order and balance while rebuilding the diocese; this has been fairly appraised and noted in that he &#x27;laboured to reverse&#x27; Latimer&#x27;s abrupt restructuring.

In 1540, Bell was a member of the committee of convocation which pronounced the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves illegal.

In 1541, Bell supported Archbishop Cranmer in the House of Lords when Cranmer was attempting to bring forward an act for the advancement of the true religion and the abolishment of the contrary&quot; however, this caused a great disruption within the conservative factions and when Bell witnessed this &#x27;he fell away from him&#x27;
(Stripe, &quot;Cranmer&quot;, p. 141), 

In the convocation of 1542, when the bishops undertook the work of a revised translation of the New Testament, the first and second epistles to the Thessalonians were assigned to Bell.

On 17 November 1543, at Hartlebury Castle, bishop Bell resigned from the see of Worcester with a pension of £133-6s–81/2d, and retired to the parish of Clerkenwell, where he was priest until his death, 11 August 1556.
==Final years==
Bell retired to London where he was priest of the parish church in Clerkenwell, until his death.

An account of his funeral was recorded by Mr. Green, a historian of Worcestershire:

&quot; Dr. Bell, sometime bishop of Worcester, was buried with due respect August 13, at Clerkenwell, with a sermon preached by Nicholas Harpsfield; he was put into his coffin, like a bishop, with the mitre and other &quot;pontificalibus&quot;; his funeral was illuminated with two white branches, two dozen staff torches, and four great tapers, [near the altar]&quot; (Strype, &quot;Memorials&quot;, Vol. 3, p. 305)

&quot;He gave by his will 2l. to the poor of Clerkenwell, 5l. to Stratford-upon-Avon, and some legacies to Jesus chantry in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, desiring that &#x27;his soul might be prayed for.&#x27; He was also a benefactor to Balliol College, Oxford, and to Cambridge, but especially to the former, where he provided for the maintenance of two scholars born in the diocese of Worcester.&quot;

&quot;Coote says of bishop Bell (&quot;English Civilians&quot;): That &#x27;He died with the character of an eloquent preacher and advocate, a learned divine, and a man of integrity and beneficence.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="419279" wikidata="Q1185562" url="?curid=419279" title="Light aircraft carrier">
<text>A light aircraft carrier, or light fleet carrier, is an aircraft carrier smaller than the standard carriers of a navy. The precise definition of the type varies by country; light carriers typically have a complement of aircraft only one-half to two-thirds the size of a full-sized fleet carrier. A light carrier was similar in concept to an escort carrier in most respects; however, light carriers were intended for higher speeds to be deployed alongside fleet carriers, while escort carriers were typically relatively slow and usually defended equally slow convoys, as well as providing air support during amphibious operations.

==History==
In World War II, the United States Navy produced a number of light carriers by converting cruiser hulls. These s, converted from light cruisers, were unsatisfactory ships for aviation with their narrow, short decks and slender, high-sheer hulls; in virtually all respects the escort carriers were superior aviation vessels. These issues were superseded by &quot;Independence&quot;-class ships&#x27; virtue of being available at a time when available carrier decks had been reduced to and in the Pacific and in the Atlantic. In addition, they had enough speed to take part in fleet actions with the larger carriers while escort carriers did not. Late in the war, a follow on to the &quot;Independence&quot; class, the , was designed. Two vessels in this class— and —were completed after the war&#x27;s end. After very brief lives as carriers, the &quot;Saipan&quot;s were converted to command and communication ships.

By the start of World War II, the Royal Navy&#x27;s , the first purpose-built aircraft carrier (launched 1919, sunk 1942) was being considered as equivalent to a light aircraft carrier, due to her small size, small aircraft complement and lack of armour. The British 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, originally designated the &quot;Colossus&quot; class, was a scaled-down version of their fleet carrier. The design could be built in a yard with little or no experience of warship construction. Although built to merchant standards, the design incorporated better watertight subdivision. Expected to have a lifetime of about three years, the last of the design was taken out of service in 2001. The first ten were built as the &quot;Colossus&quot; class, though two of these were modified whilst under construction into aircraft maintenance carriers. An additional five carriers, none of which were completed in time for service in World War II, were built with revisions upgrading the design to handle larger and heavier aircraft, receiving the designation &quot;Majestic&quot; class. In the post-war period, the Royal Navy operated a force of the ten &quot;Colossus&quot; carriers, while the five &quot;Majestic&quot; carriers were sold, during construction, to Australia, Canada and India. The &quot;Majestics&quot; were followed, after the war, by the four light carriers of the &quot;Centaur&quot; class.

In the 1970s the Royal Navy introduced a new type of light carrier, designed to operate the V/STOL Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Originally classed as &quot;through-deck cruisers&quot;, the three-ship Invincible class served into the early 21st century; HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was key to the British victory in the Falklands War.

<doc id="419280" wikidata="Q25132" url="?curid=419280" title="Paul Thomas Anderson">
<text>Paul Thomas Anderson (born June 26, 1970), also known by his initials PTA, is an American filmmaker. Often described as one of the most preeminent talents of his generation, his accolades include a BAFTA Award, and nominations for eleven Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and a Grammy Award. He is also the only person to have won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival, the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and the Silver and Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.

Anderson&#x27;s films are often psychological dramas characterized by depictions of desperate characters and explorations of dysfunctional families, alienation, loneliness, and redemption, alongside a bold visual style that uses constantly-moving camera shots and long takes. After his directorial debut, &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996), he had critical and commercial success with &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), and received further accolades with &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999) and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002). His fifth and sixth films, &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Master&quot; (2012), are often cited among the greatest of the 21st century. They were followed by &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014), &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017) and &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; (2021). His next film, &quot;One Battle After Another&quot;, will be released in 2025.

Anderson is noted for his collaborations with cinematographer Robert Elswit, costume designer Mark Bridges, composers Jon Brion and Jonny Greenwood, and several actors. He has directed music videos for artists including Fiona Apple, Haim, Aimee Mann, Joanna Newsom, Michael Penn, Radiohead and the Smile. He also directed the documentary &quot;Junun&quot; (2015) and the short music film &quot;Anima&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Anderson was born in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 26, 1970, the son of Edwina (née Gough) and actor Ernie Anderson (1923–1997). His father was the voice of ABC and played a Cleveland late-night horror host known as Ghoulardi, after whom Anderson would later name his production company. Anderson has three siblings, as well as five older half-siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley and was raised as a Roman Catholic. He had a troubled relationship with his mother, but was close with his father, who encouraged him to become a writer or director. He attended various private schools, including The Buckley School, John Thomas Dye School, Campbell Hall School, Cushing Academy, and Montclair College Preparatory School.

Anderson was involved in filmmaking from a young age, and never had an alternative plan to directing films. He made his first film when he was eight years old, and started making films on a Betamax video camera that his father bought in 1982. He later started using 8 mm film, but realized that video was easier. As a teenager, he began writing and experimenting with a Bolex 16 mm camera. After years of experimenting with &quot;standard fare&quot;, he wrote and filmed his first real production as a senior at Montclair Prep, using money he earned cleaning cages at a pet store. The film was a 30-minute mockumentary about a porn star called &quot;The Dirk Diggler Story&quot; (1988), with a story inspired by John Holmes, who also served as a major inspiration for &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), the feature-length adaptation of &quot;The Dirk Diggler Story&quot;.

==Career==
===1990s===
Anderson attended Santa Monica College, before having two semesters as an English major at Emerson College, where he was taught by David Foster Wallace. Anderson spent two days at New York University before he began his career as a production assistant on television, films, music videos, and game shows in Los Angeles and New York City. Feeling that the material shown to him at film school turned the experience into &quot;homework or a chore&quot;, Anderson decided to make a 20-minute film that would be his &quot;college&quot;.

For a budget of $10,000 (which was made up of gambling winnings, his girlfriend&#x27;s credit card, and the money his father set aside for him for college), Anderson made &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Coffee&quot; (1993), a short film connecting multiple storylines with a $20 bill. The film was screened at the 1993 Sundance Festival Shorts Program. He planned to expand the film to feature-length, and was invited to the 1994 Sundance Feature Film Program. Michael Caton-Jones served as Anderson&#x27;s mentor. He saw him as someone with &quot;talent and a fully formed creative voice, but not much hands-on experience&quot;, and gave him some hard and practical lessons.

While at Sundance, Anderson had a deal with Rysher Entertainment to direct his first full-length feature film, &quot;Sydney&quot;, which was retitled &quot;Hard Eight&quot;. After completing the film, Rysher re-edited it. He had the workprint of the original cut and submitted the film to the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown at the Un Certain Regard section. He had the version released, but only after he retitled the film, and raised the $200,000 necessary to finish it. Anderson, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly and Gwyneth Paltrow contributed to the final funding. The version that was released was Anderson&#x27;s and the acclaim from the film launched his career. The film follows the life of a senior gambler and a homeless man. Philip Seymour Hoffman worked with Anderson on five films. In his review of the film, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Movies like &quot;Hard Eight&quot; remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us.&quot;

Anderson worked on the script for his second film while working on the first one, and completed it in 1995. The result was his breakout film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, which is based on his short film &quot;The Dirk Diggler Story&quot; and is set in the Golden Age of Porn. The film follows a nightclub dishwasher who becomes a pornographic actor under his stage name. The script was noticed by New Line Cinema&#x27;s president, Michael De Luca, who felt &quot;totally gaga&quot; reading it. It was released on October 10, 1997, and was a critical and commercial success. The film revived the career of Burt Reynolds, and provided breakout roles for Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. After the film&#x27;s production, Reynolds refused to star in Anderson&#x27;s third film, &quot;Magnolia&quot;. At the 70th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Reynolds), Best Supporting Actress (Moore) and Best Original Screenplay.

After the success of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, New Line told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted for his next film and granted him creative control. Though Anderson initially wanted to make a film that was &quot;intimate and small-scale&quot;, the script &quot;kept blossoming&quot;. The result was the ensemble piece &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), which tells the story of the peculiar interaction of several individuals in San Fernando Valley. It was inspired by the music of the singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, who wrote songs for its soundtrack. At the 72nd Academy Awards, &quot;Magnolia&quot; was nominated for three awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Tom Cruise), Best Original Song for &quot;Save Me&quot; by Mann, and Best Original Screenplay. After its release, Anderson said that &quot;&quot;Magnolia&quot; is, for better or worse, the best movie I&#x27;ll ever make&quot;.

===2000s===

After the success of &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Anderson stated that he would make his next film around 90 minutes and would be working with Adam Sandler. The romance film is named &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002). It follows a beleaguered entrepreneur in love with his sister&#x27;s co-worker. The film&#x27;s main character for the subplot was inspired by real-life civil engineer David Phillips. Sandler received critical praise for his first dramatic role in the film. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. &quot;Time Out&quot; included it among the best films of the 21st century. Karina Longworth wrote, &quot;Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s cracked ode to the transformative power of love in a world that actively mocks sensitivity is perhaps his most original work.&quot;
&quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (2007) was loosely based on Upton Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;Oil!&quot;. It follows a ruthless oil prospector exploiting the Southern California oil boom in the early 20th century. Against a budget of $25 million, the film earned $76.1 million worldwide. At the 80th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for eight awards, tying with &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;. Anderson was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, losing all three to the Coen Brothers for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;. Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar for Best Actor and Robert Elswit won the prize for Best Cinematography. Paul Dano received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Anderson was nominated for Best Director from the Directors Guild of America. &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; was regarded by some critics as one of the greatest films of the decade, with some parties further declaring it one of the most accomplished American films of the modern era. David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;the young writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has now done work that bears comparison to the greatest achievements of Griffith and Ford&quot;, while Richard Schickel proclaimed it &quot;one of the most wholly original American movies ever made.&quot; In 2017, &quot;New York Times&quot; film critics A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis named it the &quot;Best Film of the 21st Century So Far&quot;.

===2010s===
In December 2009, Anderson worked on a new film about a &quot;charismatic intellectual&quot; starting a new religion in the 1950s. An associate of Anderson&#x27;s stated that the idea for the film had been in his mind for twelve years. &quot;The Master&quot; was released on September 14, 2012, in North America to critical acclaim. The film follows an alcoholic World War II veteran, who meets the leader of a religious organization. Though the film makes no reference to the movement, it has &quot;long been widely assumed to be based on Scientology.&quot; At the 85th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three awards, including for Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix), Best Supporting Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Amy Adams).

Production of the film adaptation for Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; began in May and ended in August 2013. The film marked the first time that Pynchon allowed his work to be adapted for the screen, and had Anderson work with Phoenix for a second time. The supporting cast includes Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Jena Malone, Martin Short, Benicio Del Toro, Katherine Waterston and Josh Brolin. Following its release in December 2014, the film was nominated for two awards at the 87th Academy Awards, including for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Costume Design.
Anderson directed &quot;Junun&quot;, a 2015 documentary about the making of the album by the composer and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, the Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur, and a group of Indian musicians. Most of the performances were recorded at the 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan. &quot;Junun&quot; premiered at the 2015 New York Film Festival.

Anderson&#x27;s eighth film, &quot;Phantom Thread&quot;, set in the London fashion industry, was released in December 2017. Day-Lewis starred in his final film role to date, after his penultimate film &quot;Lincoln&quot;. The cast includes Lesley Manville and Vicky Krieps. Focus Features distributed the film in the United States, with Universal Pictures handling international distribution. Principal photography began in January 2017. Elswit was absent during production, and despite claims of Anderson acting as a cinematographer on the film, no official credit was given. On February 16, 2019, Elswit said he would not work with Anderson on his next films. &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; was nominated for six awards at the 90th Academy Awards, winning one for Best Costume Design.

In 2019, Anderson directed the short music film &quot;Anima,&quot; starring the Radiohead singer Thom Yorke and featuring music from Yorke&#x27;s album &quot;Anima&quot;. It was screened in select IMAX theatres on June 26 and released on Netflix on June 27. It was nominated for Best Music Film at the 2020 Grammy Awards.

===2020s===
Anderson&#x27;s ninth film, &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;, was released in December 2021. It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the 94th Academy Awards. It follows a teenage actor in love with a photography assistant. In 2022, Anderson rewrote portions of Ridley Scott&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;Napoleon&quot; after its lead actor, Joaquin Phoenix, who had worked with Anderson, threatened to leave the project.

On January 10, 2024, it was announced that Anderson had cast Leonardo DiCaprio, Regina Hall and Sean Penn, as part of the ensemble cast of &quot;One Battle After Another&quot; based at Warner Bros. Pictures. Production began in California that month with a reported $100million budget. In February, it was reported that the &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; actress Alana Haim and the singer Teyana Taylor had joined the cast.

===Other work===
In 2000, Anderson wrote and directed a segment for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Ben Affleck, &quot;SNL FANatic&quot;, based on the MTV series &quot;FANatic&quot;. He was a standby director during the 2005 filming of Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; for insurance purposes, as Altman was 80 years old at the time. In 2008, Anderson co-wrote and directed a 70-minute play at the Largo Theatre, comprising a series of vignettes starring Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, with a live score by Jon Brion.

Anderson has directed music videos for artists, including Fiona Apple, Radiohead, Haim, Joanna Newsom, Aimee Mann, Jon Brion and Michael Penn. Anderson directed a short film for Haim in 2017, &quot;Valentine&quot;, featuring three musical performances from the band. In 2023, Anderson collaborated with Yorke and Greenwood again on the videos for &quot;Wall of Eyes&quot; and &quot;Friend of a Friend&quot;, by their band the Smile.

==Influences and style==
===Influences===
Anderson attended film school for two days, preferring instead to learn by watching the films of directors he liked along with the accompanying director&#x27;s audio commentary. He has cited Robert Altman, Jonathan Demme, Robert Downey, Sr., Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Mike Leigh, David Mamet, Anthony Mann, Vincente Minnelli, Max Ophüls, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Frank Tashlin, François Truffaut, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder as influences.

===Themes and style===
Anderson is known for films set in the San Fernando Valley with realistically flawed and desperate characters. Among the themes dealt with in the films are dysfunctional families, alienation, surrogate families, regret, loneliness, destiny, the power of forgiveness, and ghosts of the past. Anderson makes frequent use of repetition to build emphasis and thematic consistency. In &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Punch Drunk Love&quot;, and &quot;The Master&quot;, the phrase &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything&quot; is used at least once, developing themes of responsibility and denial. Anderson&#x27;s films are known for their bold visual style which includes stylistic trademarks, such as constantly moving camera shots, steadicam-based long takes, memorable use of music, and multilayered audiovisual imagery. Anderson tends to reference the Book of Exodus, either explicitly or subtly, such as in recurring references to Exodus 8:2 in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, which chronicles the plague of frogs, culminating with the literal raining of frogs in the film&#x27;s climax, or the title and themes in &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, a phrase in Exodus 7:19, which details the plague of blood.

Within his first three films, &quot;Hard Eight&quot;, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Anderson explored themes of dysfunctional families, alienation, and loneliness. &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;. In &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, Anderson explored similar themes, but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having a heightened sense of reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.

&quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; stood apart from his first four films, but shared similar themes and style, such as flawed characters, moving camera, memorable music and a lengthy running time. The film was more overtly engaged with politics than his previous films had been, examining capitalism and themes such as savagery, optimism and obsession. &quot;The Master&quot; dealt with &quot;ideas about American personality, success, rootlessness, master-disciple dynamics, and father-son mutually assured destruction.&quot; All of his films deal with American themes, with business versus art in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, ambition in &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, and self-reinvention in &quot;The Master&quot;.

===Collaborators===

Anderson frequently collaborates with many actors and crew, carrying them over on each film. He has referred to regular actors as &quot;my little rep company&quot;, including John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Melora Walters and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Luis Guzmán is also considered an Anderson regular. Hoffman acted in Anderson&#x27;s first four films as well as &quot;The Master&quot;. Except for Paul F. Tompkins, Kevin Breznahan and Jim Meskimen, who all had equally minor roles in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; had an entirely new cast. Anderson is one of three directors – the others being Jim Sheridan and Martin Scorsese – with whom Daniel Day-Lewis has collaborated more than once. Robert Elswit served as a cinematographer for Anderson&#x27;s films, except &quot;The Master&quot; which was shot by Mihai Mălaimare Jr. and &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; which has no credited cinematographer. Jon Brion served as a composer for &quot;Hard Eight&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love,&quot; and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead for every film since. Dylan Tichenor edited &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; and &quot;Phantom Thread&quot;. Anderson regularly works with producers, JoAnne Sellar, Scott Rudin, Michael De Luca and Daniel Lupi, and casting director Cassandra Kulukundis.


==Filmography==

==Personal life==

Anderson is a vegan.

He dated musician Fiona Apple from 1997 to 2000. Apple said in 2020 that he had anger issues during their relationship, and once threw a chair across the room and another time shoved her out of his car. Apple said that aspects of the relationship had made her feel &quot;fearful and numb&quot;.

Anderson has been in a relationship with actress and comedian Maya Rudolph since November 2001. They live in the San Fernando Valley with their four children.

==Awards and recognition==

Anderson has been called &quot;one of the most exciting talents to come along in years&quot; and &quot;among the supreme talents of today.&quot; After the release of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Anderson was praised as a &quot;&quot;. In 2007, the American Film Institute regarded him as &quot;one of American film&#x27;s modern masters.&quot; In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked him number one on its list of &quot;The 23 Best Film Directors in the World,&quot; writing &quot;his dedication to his craft has intensified, with his disdain for PR and celebrity marking him out as the most devout filmmaker of his generation.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named him the eighth-greatest working director, calling him &quot;one of the most dynamic directors to emerge in the last 20 years.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;The Master&quot;, the sixth film from the 42-year-old writer-director, affirms his position as the foremost filmmaking talent of his generation. Anderson is a rock star, the artist who knows no limits.&quot;

Other directors have also praised him. In an interview with Jan Aghed, Ingmar Bergman referenced &quot;Magnolia&quot; as an example of the strength of American cinema. Sam Mendes referred to Anderson as &quot;a true auteur – and there are very few of those who I would classify as geniuses&quot;. In his acceptance speech for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, Ben Affleck compared Anderson to Orson Welles.

, Anderson is the only person to win all three director prizes from the three major international film festivals (Cannes, Berlin, Venice).

<doc id="419281" wikidata="Q2234525" url="?curid=419281" title="Soulbury">
<text>Soulbury is a village and also a civil parish within the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Aylesbury Vale, about seven miles south of Central Milton Keynes, and three miles north of Wing. The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;stronghold in a gully&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the village was recorded as &quot;Soleberie&quot;.

== The parish ==
The parish contains the hamlets of:
* Hollingdon in the west,
* Chelmscote on the Stoke Hammond to Leighton Buzzard road,
* Bragenham to the east of the River Ouzel, and
* Stockgrove near Stockgrove Country Park on the border with Bedfordshire.

Other places mentioned in historical records include:
* Lortun Hill and
* a road called London Street, (mentioning William Holynden)
* Hongurhell

The parish extends as far as Rammamere Farm on Watling Street. Rammamere Heath is managed with King&#x27;s Wood in Heath and Reach as a nature reserve.

== Liscombe Park ==
A 17th-century mansion, Liscombe Park was originally the seat of the Lovett family, of whom the most famous member was Colonel John Lovett (c. 1660–1710), patron of the Eddystone Lighthouse. The house was rebuilt in the 1920s by the Bonsor family who live there today. The house is built of brick with small turrets and crenelations, in the style of an 18th-century pseudo gothic castle. The interiors are a mixture of panelling and some 18th-century styles. Near to the house is the former much older chapel, this today has been converted to a billiards room. The house is not open to the public, but the gardens are sometimes used for fairs and fetes.

The stable block has been converted to a leisure and health complex, with a polo cross field. There is a riding stables, open to the public, adjacent to the complex.

An early mention of the name as &quot;Lyscombe&quot; appears in 1418, where Roger Stok and his wife, Sara, lived, suing people from Stewkley (appearing as &quot;Stucle&quot;) and Burcote.

Soulbury gave its name to Solebury Township, Pennsylvania, which was founded by Quaker settlers from Soulbury.

== Glacial erratic rock ==

A glacial erratic lies in a road in the parish. The stone originated in Derbyshire, and was deposited by the retreat of glaciers at the end of the last ice age. Oliver Cromwell is said to have used the stone as a podium during an attack on the village church during the English Civil War. Local tradition holds that the stone is the petrified foot of the devil.

In March 2016, the stone was hit by a motorist who made complaints of it being a hazard, prompting the county council to investigate its removal. The parish council and villagers strongly opposed its removal and the stone still remains in its ancient position.

There is a public house in Soulbury called the Boot. Its pub sign features a boot of the Duke of Wellington, but the tradition of the Soulbury Boot is said to be much older than that. It is said that the Devil himself once came to the village, but the villagers came together to fight him off. One of them took his sword and cut off the Devil&#x27;s foot and as it fell to the ground it turned to stone. The stone came to be known as the Soulbury Boot. This story is said by some to have been made up by a previous pub landlord in order to attract visitors.

=== Soulbury Millennium Green ===
This public greenspace is owned and run by a local charitable trust and was created as part of the celebrations for the turn of the Millennium in the year 2000. It is one of 245 such Millennium Greens throughout England and the only one in Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="419283" wikidata="Q945517" url="?curid=419283" title="Howard W. Hunter">
<text>Howard William Hunter (November 14, 1907 – March 3, 1995) was an American lawyer and the 14th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1994 to 1995. His nine-month presidential tenure is the shortest in the church&#x27;s history. Hunter was the first president of the LDS Church born in the 20th century and the last to die in it. He was sustained as an LDS apostle at the age of 51, and served as a general authority for over 35 years.

==Early life==
Hunter was born to John William and Nellie Marie Hunter in Boise, Idaho. His father, who was not a Latter-day Saint but joined the church in 1927, would not allow Hunter to be baptized until he was 12; Hunter was ordained to the Aaronic priesthood several months after he turned 12. He was the second person to become an Eagle Scout in the state of Idaho.

In March 1923, the Boise Ward, where Hunter had been a member since his baptism, was split, and he ended up in the new Boise 2nd Ward. It initially met in a Jewish synagogue that was provided free of charge. When calls were issued to build the Boise LDS Tabernacle, Hunter was the first to pledge money for the building, offering $25.

Hunter had a love for music and played the piano, violin, drums, saxophone, clarinet, and trumpet. He formed a band called Hunter&#x27;s Croonaders, which played at many regional events and on a cruise ship to Asia.

==Professional career==
In 1928, Hunter tried a system where he would publish train and bus schedules and charge for advertising, placing them in hotels. The project worked moderately well in such cities as Nampa and Twin Falls, but it was unsuccessful in Pocatello, Idaho. After this failure, Hunter moved to southern California.

In California, Hunter initially worked in a citrus factory and in shoe sales. After a few weeks he secured a job at a Bank of Italy branch on April 23, 1928. Hunter studied at the American Institute of Banking while working for the Bank of Italy. Besides working in banking, Hunter was still playing the saxophone for dances on a regular basis.

In November 1930, Hunter was involved in booking for the merger of the Bank of Italy with the Bank of America of California to form the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association. Shortly after, Hunter took a position as a junior officer with the First Exchange Bank of Inglewood. This bank was taken over by the state of California and placed in receivership in January 1932. For the next two years, Hunter filled several odd jobs, including working as a bridge painter and a laundry detergent peddler. In 1934, he managed to get a position as a title examiner with the Los Angeles County Flood Control District. In 1935, Hunter began his studies at Southwestern Law School and eventually had a successful career as a lawyer.

==Leadership in the LDS Church==

Prior to his call as an apostle, Hunter held several leadership positions in the LDS Church. He was the first president of the church&#x27;s Pasadena California Stake, where he had also served as a bishop.

Hunter became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1959. He filled a vacancy in the Quorum created when apostle Henry D. Moyle was added to the First Presidency following the death of Stephen L Richards, a counselor in the First Presidency.

In January 1965, Hunter was appointed the president of the board of directors of the Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC). At the time, the PCC was two years old, had just closed its second year with a loss of nearly $500,000, and had barely made payroll the month before. Hunter reduced board membership from 21 to 10, drew members with more broad business backgrounds, and emphasized &quot;good hard headed business practice.&quot; In three years, the PCC was turning a profit. He remained the president of PCC&#x27;s board of directors until 1976.

As an apostle, Hunter led church negotiations to acquire land in Jerusalem to build the BYU Jerusalem Center, which he dedicated in 1989.

In 1970, when Joseph Fielding Smith became president of the church, Hunter succeeded him as Church Historian and Recorder. Hunter held this position until 1972, and was succeeded by Leonard J. Arrington.

In November 1985, when Ezra Taft Benson became church president, Hunter was named Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve due to the infirmity of Marion G. Romney, who became quorum president by seniority. Hunter became the quorum president upon Romney&#x27;s death in 1988.

Hunter became church president in June 1994, following Benson&#x27;s death. Hunter retained Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson as counselors in the First Presidency. He offered a conciliatory message at his initial news conference, saying, &quot;To those who have transgressed or been offended, we say, &#x27;Come back.&#x27;&quot;

Some of Hunter&#x27;s contributions as church president include the creation of the church&#x27;s 2000th stake and drafting of the &quot;Proclamation on the Family&quot;, which was released six months after his death. As church president, Hunter encouraged and emphasized Christ-like living and temple attendance. He dedicated the Orlando Florida and Bountiful Utah temples shortly before his death.

Hunter&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2016 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.
===Leadership in other LDS Church-owned endeavors===
Hunter served in several LDS Church assignments not directly related to ecclesiastical matters while a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of Brigham Young University and closely involved with the founding of the J. Reuben Clark Law School. He also was a member of the Board of Trustees of the New World Archaeology Foundation, chairman of the board of the PCC, and president of the Genealogical Society of Utah.

===Attempted hostage incident===
While preparing to speak at a CES fireside being held at Brigham Young University&#x27;s Marriott Center on February 7, 1993, Hunter was confronted by Cody Judy, who rushed onto the rostrum and threatened Hunter and the audience of 15,000 to 17,000. Judy carried a briefcase that he claimed contained a bomb and held what appeared to be a detonator-like device. Judy demanded that Hunter read a three-page document that supposedly detailed God&#x27;s plan for Judy to lead the church, which Hunter refused to do. The audience spontaneously sang &quot;We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet&quot;, during which students from the audience, and then security personnel, overtook Judy. After Judy was taken away, Hunter delivered his prepared remarks, a talk entitled, &quot;An Anchor to the Souls of Men.&quot;

==Health problems and death==
When Hunter was four years old, he was stricken with polio, which afflicted his back so that he was never able to bend forward and touch the ground again.

While serving as president of the Quorum of the Twelve, Hunter developed major health problems that continued for the remainder of his life, including a heart attack, broken ribs from a fall at general conference, heart bypass surgery, bleeding ulcers, and kidney failure. Hunter was admitted to LDS Hospital on January 12, 1995, for exhaustion and was released on January 16. While hospitalized, it was discovered that Hunter was suffering from prostate cancer that had spread to the bones.

Hunter died at age 87 in his downtown Salt Lake City residence as a result of the cancer. With him at the time of his death were his wife, Inis; his nurse, who had been attending him; and his personal secretary, Lowell Hardy. Funeral services were held on March 8, 1995, at the Salt Lake Tabernacle, under the direction of Hinckley, Hunter&#x27;s counselor in the First Presidency and president of the Quorum of the Twelve. Hinckley replaced Hunter as president of the LDS Church. Hunter was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. On October 14, 2007, at her home in Laguna Hills, California, Inis Hunter died of causes incident to age.
==Personal life==
In June 1928, Hunter met Clara May &quot;Claire&quot; Jeffs, a young woman from Salt Lake City and they were married in the Salt Lake Temple on June 10, 1931. The Hunters&#x27; first son, William, died a year before Hunter started law school. While he was in law school, they had other two sons, Richard and John, who lived until adulthood and both became attorneys. After the death of Hunter&#x27;s first wife in 1983, he married Inis Stanton in 1990 while he was president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

<text>Southcote (or Southcott) is a hamlet in the parish of Linslade, in Bedfordshire, England. It is in the civil parish of Leighton-Linslade. The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin and means &#x27;southern cottage&#x27;.

The hamlet, little more than one road of cottages, is located to the south of the small town of Linslade, to which it has become joined as Linslade has grown. Linslade has itself joined to the larger town of Leighton Buzzard and hence Southcote appears to be a small suburb of Leighton Buzzard. The hamlet is home to the Hare Inn, a pub located on Southcott Green. There has been a pub in Southcott since at least 1847, although the pub was not known as &quot;The Hare&quot; until 1876.

The Rothschild family who reside at nearby Ascott House maintain a stud farm at Southcote, and own the remaining agricultural land in the hamlet. Built in 1880, the stud farm and its adjoining former managers&#x27; homes are known as &quot;Southcourt Stud&quot;. This leads to confusion as to the hamlet&#x27;s true name, especially as in the immediate vicinity is a Southcourt Avenue.

The stud farm is home to numerous &quot;Rothschild home counties style&quot; cottages, including the former stud groom&#x27;s quarters at neighbouring St Frusquins Cottage, named after champion racehorse St. Frusquin, who retired to stud at Southcourt. The Cottage hosted numerous visitors to the stud farm, including former Prime Minister Winston Churchill who became a prolific owner and trainer of racehorses in his later years.

Southcourt Cottage, a large Victorian house, close to the stud, was from 1922 to 1951 let by the Rothschild family to Sir Basil Henriques the philanthropist and social reformer, known for his work with Jewish youth in the east end of London. Southcourt Cottage became a holiday home for these children. He also wrote several books on reforming juvenile law, and founded educational youth clubs in the Whitechapel area of the city.

Southcote was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Bedfordshire in 1974. The hamlet is home to numerous listed buildings, and in 1993 Southcott Village was designated as a Conservation Area.

Southcott Lower School in Linslade is named after the parish.

<doc id="419287" wikidata="Q335547" url="?curid=419287" title="Brian Faulkner">
<text>Arthur Brian Deane Faulkner, Baron Faulkner of Downpatrick, (18 February 1921 – 3 March 1977), was the sixth and last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, from March 1971 until his resignation in March 1972. He was also the chief executive of the short-lived Northern Ireland Executive during the first half of 1974.
Faulkner was also the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from 1971 to 1974.

==Early life==
Faulkner was born in Helen&#x27;s Bay, County Down, Ireland, some 2 months before the creation of Northern Ireland. The elder of two sons of James and Nora Faulkner. His younger brother was Colonel Sir Dennis Faulkner, . James Faulkner owned the Belfast Collar Company which traded under the name Faulat. At that time, Faulat was the largest single-purpose shirt manufacturer in the world, employing some 3,000 people. He was educated initially at Elm Park preparatory school, Killylea, County Armagh, but at 14 was sent to the Church of Ireland-affiliated St Columba&#x27;s College at Rathfarnham in Dublin, although Faulkner was Presbyterian. Faulkner chose St Columba&#x27;s, preferring to stay in Ireland rather than go to school in England. His best friend at the school was Michael Yeats, son of W. B. Yeats. He was the only prime minister of Northern Ireland to have been educated in the Irish Free State and one of only two to have been educated in Ireland.

Faulkner entered the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in 1939 to study law, but, with the advent of World War II, he quit his studies to work full-time in the family shirt-making business.

==Early political career==
Faulkner became involved in unionist politics, the first of his family to do so, and was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland as the Ulster Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of East Down in 1949. His vociferous traditional unionist approach to politics ensured him a prominent backbench position. He was, at the time, the youngest ever MP in the Northern Irish Parliament. He was also the first Chairman of the Ulster Young Unionist Council in 1949.

In 1956 Faulkner was offered and accepted the job of Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, or Government Chief Whip.

==Ministerial office==
In 1959, he became Minister of Home Affairs and his handling of security for most of the Irish Republican Army&#x27;s Border Campaign of 1956–62 bolstered his reputation in the eyes of the right wing of Ulster unionism.

When Terence O&#x27;Neill became prime minister in 1963 he appointed Faulkner, his chief rival for the job, as Minister of Commerce. Faulkner resigned in 1969 over the technicalities of how and when to bring in the local government reforms which the British Labour government was pushing for. This was a factor in the resignation of Terence O&#x27;Neill, who resigned as prime minister in the aftermath of his failure to achieve a good enough result in the 1969 Northern Ireland general election.

In the ensuing leadership contest, Faulkner lost out again when O&#x27;Neill gave his casting vote to his cousin, James Chichester-Clark. In 1970, Faulkner became the Father of the House.

Faulkner came back into government as Minister of Development under Chichester-Clark and in a sharp turn-around, began the implementation of the political reforms that were the main cause of his resignation from O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s cabinet.

Chichester-Clark himself resigned in 1971; the political and security situation and the more intensive British interest proving difficult.

==Prime minister==

=== Promising beginnings===
In March 1971 Faulkner was elected leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and thus became prime minister. In his initial innovative approach to government, he gave a non-unionist, David Bleakley, a former Northern Ireland Labour Party MP, a position in his cabinet as Minister for Community Relations. In June 1971, he proposed three new powerful committees at Stormont which would give the opposition salaried chairmanships of two of them.

===Initial troubles===
However, this initiative (radical at the time) was soon overtaken by events. The shooting of two Catholic youths in Derry by British soldiers prompted the SDLP, the largest Nationalist party and main opposition to boycott the Stormont parliament. The political climate deteriorated further when, in response to the worsening security situation, and in a move without precedent in the United Kingdom in modern times, Faulkner introduced internment on 9 August 1971. This was a disaster; instead of lessening the violence, it caused the situation to worsen.

David Bleakley resigned in September 1971 over internment and Faulkner appointed Dr G. B. Newe, a prominent Catholic, as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office. Faulkner&#x27;s administration staggered on through the rest of 1971, insisting that security was the paramount issue.

In January 1972, an incident occurred during a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march in Derry, during which paratroopers shot and killed thirteen unarmed civilians. A fourteenth civilian was to die later. What history has come to know as Bloody Sunday was, in essence, the end of Faulkner&#x27;s government. In March 1972, Faulkner refused to maintain a government without security powers which the British government under Edward Heath decided to take back. The Stormont parliament was subsequently prorogued (initially for a period of one year) and following the appointment of a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, direct rule was introduced.

==Chief Executive==

In June 1973, elections were held to a new devolved parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections split the UUP. Faulkner became chief executive in a power-sharing executive with the SDLP and the centre-ground Alliance Party, a political alliance cemented at the Sunningdale Conference that year. However, the prominence in the Sunningdale Agreement of the cross-border Council of Ireland suggested that Faulkner had strayed too far ahead of his party. A section of the party had previously broken away to form the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party, which contested the elections in opposition to the UUP.

The power-sharing Executive which he led lasted only six months and was brought down by a loyalist Ulster Workers Council Strike in May 1974. Loyalist paramilitary organisations were prominent in intimidating utility workers and blockading roads. The strike had the tacit support of many unionists. In 1974, Faulkner lost the leadership of the UUP to anti-Sunningdale elements led by Harry West. He subsequently resigned from the Ulster Unionist Party and formed the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.

The UPNI fared badly in the Convention elections of 1975, winning only five out of the 78 seats contested. Whereas Faulkner had topped the poll in South Down in 1973 with over 16,000 votes, he polled just 6,035 votes in 1975 and finished seventh, winning the final seat. In 1976 Faulkner announced that he was quitting active politics. He was elevated to the House of Lords in the New Year&#x27;s Honours list of 1977, being created Baron Faulkner of Downpatrick, of Downpatrick in the County of Down on 7 February 1977.

==Personal life==

Faulkner married Lucy Forsythe, a graduate of Trinity College Dublin, in 1951. They met through their common interests in politics and hunting. She was equally suited to a political partnership having had a career in journalism with the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; and was secretary to the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, Sir Basil Brooke, when they met. Together they had three children: a daughter and two sons. They took up residence at Highlands, not far from the village of Seaforde. One of his sons, Michael, has written a memoir, &quot;The Blue Cabin&quot; (2006) about his move to the family&#x27;s former holiday house on the island of Islandmore on Strangford Lough. Michael Faulkner died on 1 June 2024 at the age of 71.

Brian Faulkner was a member of the Apprentice Boys of Derry but was expelled from the group in 1971.

Faulkner considered himself to be both Irish and British, writing &quot;the Northern Ireland citizen is Irish and British; it is a question of complement, not of conflict&quot; and reacted to the Republic of Ireland Act by remarking &quot;They have no right to the title Ireland, a name of which we are just as proud as they&quot;.

==Death==
Lord Faulkner, a keen huntsman, died on 3 March 1977 at the age of 56 following a riding accident whilst hunting with the County Down Staghounds at the Ballyagherty/Station Road junction near Saintfield, County Down. Faulkner had been riding at full gallop along a narrow country road when his horse slipped. Faulkner was thrown off and killed instantly. He was laid to rest at Magherahamlet Presbyterian Church near Spa in County Down where he had been a regular member of the congregation. Lord Faulkner had retired from active politics and was pursuing his interests in industry at the time of his death. He had recently become a European consultant for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, a company which he proved instrumental in attracting to Northern Ireland during his tenure as Minister of Commerce. His twenty-four-day life peerage was thus the shortest-lived until the death of Lord Heywood of Whitehall in 2018 just nine days after ennoblement, although there have been hereditary peerages, such as that of Lord Leighton, which have been shorter still.

<text>Tessa Ann Vosper Blackstone, Baroness Blackstone, (born 27 September 1942) is an English politician and university administrator.

==Early life==
Her father, Geoffrey Vaughan Blackstone, CBE, GM, was the Chief Fire Officer for Hertfordshire and her mother, Joanna Vosper, was an actress and model for the House of Worth in Paris. She was educated at Ware Grammar School for Girls and the London School of Economics, where she gained a doctorate. Her doctoral thesis, titled &quot;The provision of pre-school education: A study of the influences on the development of nursery education in Britain from 1900–1965&quot;, was submitted in 1969.

==Career==

Her academic career began at the former Enfield College (now Middlesex University) before she went on to become a lecturer at the LSE and Professor of Educational Administration at the University of London Institute of Education.

Blackstone was Deputy Education Officer of the Inner London Education Authority (1983–1986). She has also worked as a policy adviser in the Cabinet Office. As a member of Jim Callaghan&#x27;s Downing Street thinktank, she upset the Foreign Office by criticizing diplomats&#x27; lavish lifestyles.

She headed Birkbeck College, University of London, for a decade as Master (from 1987 to 1997) until her appointment to the new Labour government in 1997. She has also concurrently held research fellowships at the Centre for Studies in Public Policy and the Policy Studies Institute.Blackstone became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Greenwich, holding this position up to 2011.

She has served as chairman of the ballet board of the Royal Opera House, the Fabian Society, and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), and has sat on the governing bodies of numerous other organisations. She has been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation. She is currently Chairman of the British Library and Chairman of Great Ormond Street hospital. She is currently the patron of Hamlin Fistula UK, a charity whose aim is to raise funds and awareness to support the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital.

==Politics==
She is a Labour life peer and sits in the House of Lords, having been created Baroness Blackstone, &quot;of Stoke Newington in Greater London&quot;, on 18 March 1987. Originally on the Opposition front bench in House of Lords, Blackstone held a succession of portfolios during her time at Birkbeck.

Self-described as &#x27;vintage&#x27; rather than old or new Labour, Blackstone was Minister for Education at the Department of Education from 1997 to 2001 then Minister for the Arts at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport 2001–2003. While in her position here she attended The European Higher Education Area Ministerial Conferences and was a member of the European Ministers of Education that signed The Bologna Declaration of 19 June 1999.

On 15 September 2010, Blackstone, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK.

==Current activities==
She is a Patron of Humanists UK and chairs the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) trust. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. In 2009, she became the chair at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and later in 2010, she became chair at the British Library, a 4-year term. In September 2012, she joined the board of the Orbit Group housing association as its future chair.

In January 2013, she became co-chair at the Franco-British Council together with Christian de Boissieu, an organisation which looks to promote better understanding between Britain and France and to contribute to the development of joint action. She is the chair to the British Section of the council. She became the Chair of the Bar Standards Board in January 2018.

<doc id="419289" wikidata="Q952000" url="?curid=419289" title="Arthur Lismer">
<text>Arthur Lismer, LL.D. (27 June 1885 – 23 March 1969) was an English-Canadian painter, member of the Group of Seven and educator. He is known primarily as a landscape painter and for his paintings of ships in dazzle camouflage.

==Early life==
Lismer was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, the son of Harriet and Edward Lismer, a draper&#x27;s buyer. At age thirteen, he apprenticed at a photo-engraving company. He was awarded a scholarship, and used this time to take evening classes at the Sheffield School of Art from 1898 until 1905. In 1905, he moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where he studied art at the Academie Royale.

Lismer immigrated to Canada in 1911, settled in Toronto, Ontario, and took a job with Grip Ltd. where he met Tom Thomson. In May 1914, he went camping with him in Algonquin Park, writing about the trip:
Our canoe was a 16 footer Chestnut, canvas covered, roomy &amp; capable of carrying the weight we had to put in it, stores for two weeks, tent, blankets, a cooking oven and utensils, plates and pannekins of aluminum, fishing tackle, axe, &amp; sketching impedimenta, this last consisting (for me) of two dozen 12 1⁄2 x 9 1⁄2 three ply veneer boards of birch wood back and front &amp; soft pine inside, &amp; good for sketching. These fit into a holder designed to carry six &amp; two more into a flat sketch box, also about 12 to 15 pounds of paint, oil, brushes per man. When our canoe was fully laden, we had about 2 1⁄2 inches of free board above the water line &amp; with our two selves about 560 lbs. in all.

==Principalship of NSCAD University==
At thirty-one years of age, Lismer moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1916 and served as the Principal of the Victoria School of Art and Design (now NSCAD University). With only twelve students when he began his principalship, Lismer was able to increase the student body to 150 pupils by the time he resigned in 1919. 

With the goal of broadening the public reach of the art school, Lismer created new programs including Saturday morning art classes that he would re-create at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario). In addition to his teaching and administrative duties, he held the curatorship of the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts located at the Victoria School of Art and Design.

==Official war artist==
In wartime Halifax, Lismer was inspired by the shipping and naval activity of the port, notably the dramatically painted dazzle camouflaged ships with their patterns of curved and zigzag lines designed to mislead
German U-boats and submarines. Lismer&#x27;s work came to the attention of Lord Beaverbrook who arranged for Lismer to be commissioned as an official war artist. His best-known work from the war years depicted what he observed and learned about in Halifax, Nova Scotia: Mine sweeping, convoying, patrolling and harbour defense. Lismer completed a number of oil studies and finished several major canvases during 1918 and 1919. These included the large and ebullient &quot;Convoy in Bedford Basin&quot; (c.1919)&quot;,&quot; which depicts merchant ships forming a transatlantic convoy near Halifax. He also did some sketches of the Halifax Explosion.

During his time as a war artist, he wrote a booklet for the Canadian Armed Services titled &quot;How to get started: Watercolor Painting for Pleasure&quot;.

==Group of Seven and afterwards==

Lismer returned to Toronto in 1919 when he was appointed vice-principal of the Ontario College of Art. With the collaboration of four artists at Grip where Lismer had previously worked, he helped found the Group of Seven, whose work contributed to the process of giving Canada a distinctive national voice in painting. He also worked with the cadre at Grip Ltd..

Arthur Lismer&#x27;s style was influenced by his pre-Canadian experience (primarily in Antwerp), where he found the Barbizon and Post-Impressionist movements a key inspiration. Collaborating with the group of artists who would, in 1920, become the Group of Seven, Lismer exhibited the characteristic post-impressionist style, and spiritual connection with the landscape that would embody that group&#x27;s work. Like the other members of the Group of Seven many of his works began as small en plein air sketches in oil on hardboard. Like other members of the Group of Seven too, Lismer became a member of the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933. 

During the Centennial of the City of Toronto, in 1934, Lismer was on the Pictures Committee. His work in art education was effective; and this service to the wider community caused Lismer to become influential in ways not always achieved by his artist colleagues. For example, he started a children&#x27;s art program at the Art Gallery of Toronto, which became successful in the 1930s. In 1936, as Lismer&#x27;s prominence in the field of art education involved him in international travels, he went on a one-year tour of South Africa. Together with art educator Norah McCullough, he organized art education programmes, lectured on Canadian art and gave workshops for teachers. On the trip, he painted extensively in watercolour.

He moved to Montreal in 1940, as a result of being given a teaching appointment at the Art Association of Montreal and established the MMFA School of Art and Design. He joined the McGill School of Architecture as a sessional lecturer in 1943 at the invitation of John Bland, the School’s director, and was appointed assistant professor in 1945, retiring in 1955 at the age of seventy.

Between 1940 and 1950, he travelled in the summertime to the east coast of Canada to paint. He particularly liked to paint fishermen`s gear on the docks of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.

In 1951, a retrospective exhibition of Lismer&#x27;s work, originating at the Art Gallery of Toronto, traveled in an abbreviated version to the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the University of British Columbia Fine Arts Gallery and may have influenced him to take his first trip to the West Coast in the summer of that year. Using Galiano Island as a base, he explored Pender and Saltspring Islands, as well as Victoria and Long Beach on Vancouver Island.

Lismer died on March 23, 1969, in Montreal, Quebec, and was buried alongside other members of the original Seven on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection.

<doc id="419293" wikidata="Q1595152" url="?curid=419293" title="Throwing Muses">
<text>Throwing Muses are an American alternative rock band formed in 1981 in Newport, Rhode Island, United States, that toured and recorded extensively until 1997, when its members began concentrating more on other projects. 

The group was originally fronted by two stepsisters, Kristin Hersh and Tanya Donelly, who both wrote the group&#x27;s songs. Throwing Muses are known for performing music with shifting tempos, creative chord progressions, unorthodox song structures, and surreal lyrics. The group was set apart from other contemporary acts by Hersh&#x27;s stark, candid writing style; Donelly&#x27;s pop stylings and vocal harmonies; and David Narcizo&#x27;s unusual drumming techniques eschewing use of cymbals.

== History ==
=== 1983–1986: Formation, first EP and &quot;The Doghouse Cassette&quot;, debut album ===

Throwing Muses were formed in 1983 by Kristin Hersh and her stepsister Tanya Donelly, who were both attending Rogers High School. They initially called themselves &quot;Kristin Hersh and the Muses&quot;, in which they were accompanied by bass player Elaine Adamedes and drummer Becca Blumen, who later were replaced by Leslie Langston and David Narcizo, respectively. Narcizo did not originally know how to play the drums, but when Hersh told him Blumen had left the band and he could join, Narcizo said, &quot;I had never played a drum kit before – all I&#x27;d played was marching drums and concert drums. We found somebody whose kit we could borrow, but it arrived without cymbals. I learned to play on it without cymbals which then became my trademark early on.&quot;

Throwing Muses released their debut self-titled EP in 1984 on their own Blowing Fuses label. In 1985, they released a set of demos, later known as &quot;The Doghouse Cassette,&quot; garnering a number-one college radio hit, &quot;Sinkhole&quot; and extensive coverage in the local music press. Demo producer Gary Smith of Fort Apache Studios led them to sign with 4AD, where they became the label&#x27;s first American band. Kristin recalls, &quot;I signed with them because [owner] Ivo [Watts-Russell] was funny and goofy, and that was about it.&quot; In 1986, they released their self-titled debut album produced by Gil Norton. Hersh has written the memoir &quot;Rat Girl&quot; about the year the band moved to Boston, was signed, and recorded their first album.

=== 1987–1991: further EPs, &quot;House Tornado&quot;, &quot;Hunkpapa&quot; and &quot;The Real Ramona&quot; ===
In 1987, Throwing Muses released two EPs, &quot;Chains Changed&quot; and &quot;The Fat Skier&quot;, released July 6. These were followed in 1988 by their second studio album, &quot;House Tornado&quot;, produced by Gary Smith and engineered by Paul Kolderie; it was recorded at Fort Apache Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The album was released internationally on the 4AD label, except in the United States, where it was released by Sire Records. Sire used a different album cover for its release, as the label was putting a strong promotional push behind the band, and label executives favored a picture of the band over the collage featured on the 4AD release. Both &quot;House Tornado&quot; and &quot;the Fat Skier&quot; were combined on a single CD in a later release. The band embarked on a tour of the UK, supported by the Pixies, to support &quot;House Tornado&quot;.

In 1989, the band released their third album, &quot;Hunkpapa&quot;, which was produced by Gary Smith and engineered by Steve Haigler. The album saw Hersh experimenting with more conventional melodic structures, although the fractious lyrics remained. The song “Dizzy” was released as a single.

In 1990, bassist Leslie Langston left and was replaced by Fred Abong. Throwing Muses recorded their fourth album, &quot;The Real Ramona&quot; during the same year. &quot;The Real Ramona&quot; is considered to have a more poppy sound than their previous records. The song &quot;Counting Backwards&quot; from the album was released as a single. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release in 1991, Tanya Donelly left the Muses to form Belly, taking Abong with her.

=== 1992–2002: Work as trio – &quot;Red Heaven&quot;, &quot;University&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot; and disbandment ===
With Donelly not being replaced, Throwing Muses opted to continue as a trio, with Bernard Georges replacing Abong on bass. In 1992, the band made a fresh start recording their fifth album &quot;Red Heaven&quot; at The Power Station and Fort Apache Studios. The album was produced by Throwing Muses and Steve Boyer, and also featured guest appearances by Leslie Langston and by Hüsker Dü frontman Bob Mould (the latter duetting with Hersh on the song &quot;Dio&quot;).

In 1993, they recorded their sixth album, &quot;University&quot;. Hersh recorded her debut album, &quot;Hips and Makers&quot;, immediately after recording finished on &quot;University&quot;. &quot;Hips and Makers&quot; was released first, in 1994, which delayed the release of &quot;University&quot; until 1995. &quot;University&quot; gave the band their first national U.S. hit, &quot;Bright Yellow Gun&quot;. The album was favorably reviewed.

Throwing Muses released their seventh album, &quot;Limbo&quot;, which was followed by a tour. However, the band disbanded in 1997 as Kristin Hersh went on to continue her solo career.

=== 2002–present: Reformation – &quot;Throwing Muses&quot;, &quot;Purgatory&quot;, etc. ===
In March 2003, Throwing Muses came back with their eighth album, &quot;Throwing Muses&quot;, which also saw the return of Tanya Donelly who provided backing vocals on the album. A greatest hits compilation titled &quot;Anthology&quot; was released in 2011. The band&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Purgatory / Paradise&quot; was released on October 29, 2013 in the UK and November 11 in the US.

In early 2014, the band toured a few U.S. cities, with Donelly opening for the East Coast dates.

The first single from their new album &quot;Sun Racket&quot;, titled &quot;Dark Blue&quot;, was released in February 2020. The album was released on Fire Records on September 4, 2020.

<text>Sir Rhodes Boyson (11 May 192528 August 2012) was an English educator, author and Conservative Party politician who served as Member of Parliament for Brent North. He was knighted and made a member of the Privy Council in 1987.

==Early life==
Born in Haslingden, Lancashire, England, the son of cotton-spinner and Alderman William Boyson MBE JP, and his wife Bertha, Rhodes Boyson was educated at Haslingden Grammar School, University College Cardiff, the University of Manchester, the London School of Economics, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

He was awarded a PhD in 1967 by London University, his thesis being on Henry Ashworth, a Victorian Lancashire cotton manufacturer, brother-in-law of Richard Cobden, and a Radical campaigner who also had a reputation as a model employer. It was published in 1970 by Oxford University Press as &quot;The Ashworth Cotton Enterprise. The Rise and Fall of a Factory Firm. 1818–1880&quot;.

==Early career==
Called up towards the end of the Second World War, Boyson served with the Royal Navy, based in India at the time of Independence, and from his late 20s, he was a Methodist lay preacher.

He became a teacher in 1950, and later a head teacher, first at Lea Bank Secondary Modern School in Cloughfold, Rossendale (1955–61), then at Robert Montefiore Secondary School, Stepney, London (1961–66), and finally from 1967 to 1974 at Highbury Grove School, a new all-boys&#x27; comprehensive in Islington, North London, of which he was the founding head teacher; in this capacity, and subsequently as an MP, he was outspoken in support of the retention of corporal punishment in British schools. He opposed what he perceived to be lax discipline, both in modern education and in the wider society, and at Highbury Grove he introduced an unfashionably traditional regime, with strictly enforced uniforms, caning for misbehaviour, and a house system. He said that this proved so popular with local parents that the school was consistently oversubscribed.

From 1957 to 1961, Boyson was a Labour councillor in Haslingden, where his father was at that time a Labour alderman and had been a trade union secretary. His father was a cotton spinner, and had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector in the First World War.

Boyson left the Labour Party in 1964, joining the Conservative Party three years later. He later wrote:

My own move to Conservative party membership arose from the effect of my research into the cotton industry and the Manchester school of liberal economic philosophy. Here was a body of men who believed that a free enterprise economy was not only efficient but brought moral growth to all men. The employer risked his capital on his judgement and must care for his workers as part of his stock in trade, and the workers would be enabled to become prosperous and through their own industry, thrift and moral courage could establish their own business enterprises and their personal independence to the advantage of themselves, their families and society. Cobden had a moral view of society and believed that free enterprise would not only bring prosperity but social harmony at home and peace abroad within a system of universal free trade.

In 1977, he was co-author (with Brian Cox) of one of the series of Black Papers on education, criticising many aspects of the comprehensive schools system.

Boyson was a severe critic of what he regarded as the influence of &quot;mindless sociologists&quot; who produced &quot;mush which has corrupted the national character&quot;, noting in 1978 that &quot;it has not gone unnoticed that crime has increased parallel with the number of social workers&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; responded with an editorial comment &quot;that crime has also increased parallel with speeches from Dr. Boyson&quot;.

He served as chairman of the National Council for Educational Standards.

==Parliamentary career==

Having stood unsuccessfully at Eccles in 1970, Boyson was first elected to the House of Commons in February 1974 for Brent North, and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of Education and Science 1979–1983. In this capacity he sought to uphold schools&#x27; right to use the cane, and was nicknamed the &quot;Minister for Flogging&quot; by the anti-corporal-punishment campaign STOPP. He was Minister of State for Social Security 1983–1984, for Northern Ireland 1984–1986 and for Local Government 1986–1987.

Boyson was a strong opponent of homosexuality, and a supporter of Section 28. He said:It is wrong biblically, is homosexuality. It is unnatural. AIDS is part of the fruits of the permissive society. The regular one-man, one-woman marriage would not put us at risk in this way. If we could wipe out homosexual practices, then Aids would die out.

Boyson was a supporter of the Conservative Monday Club and frequently addressed them. At the Conservative Party Annual Conference at Blackpool on 10 October 1991 he was the principal speaker at a Club fringe meeting on the subject of &quot;A Conservative Revolution in Education&quot;.

In 1994, he appeared on the BBC topical panel TV show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Brass Eye&quot; and was an early interviewee of Ali G.

Boyson lost his Brent North seat in the Labour landslide of 1997, his 24% majority turning to a 10% majority for the opposition, partly because of his perceived lack of commitment to the campaign to retain Edgware General Hospital; in 2001, the seat, no longer contested by Boyson, swung a further 9% to Labour.

==Personal life==
Distinctive personal features were his mutton chop whiskers and strong Lancashire accent. The whiskers dated from an occasion when he rebuked pupils for having long hair at the school where he was headmaster: the students retorted jokingly, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you grow your hair, Sir, if we cut ours.&quot;

In 2007, he received an honorary degree from the University of Buckingham.

Boyson married Violet Burletson in 1946, and they had two daughters. The couple divorced in 1971, after which he married Florette MacFarlane, a teacher. He and his second wife lived in Pinner, northwest London, until he moved into Cedar House nursing home in Harefield, where he died aged 87. He left more than £2,000,000 in his will, the majority of it going to his widow. She died in 2018.

<doc id="419295" wikidata="Q7575734" url="?curid=419295" title="Speen, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Speen is a village in the Chiltern Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, situated in the civil parish of Lacey Green, in Buckinghamshire, England.

The centre of the village (depicted by the village sign) is south-east of Princes Risborough, and north of High Wycombe. The village is a short distance &#x27;as the crow flies&#x27; from Hampden House, originally owned by John Hampden and a further distance from Chequers, the country residence of the Prime Minister.

The village has an annual fete which is usually held on the first weekend of July and a bi-annual arts festival which has been running for many years. The festival consists of entertainment shows, a theatre production and general activities on Speen Playing Field.

== History ==

The village name originates from Anglo Saxon. The exact meaning is unclear, but possibly meaning &#x27;wood-chip place&#x27;. The name of the village corresponds to the location of the hamlet in the Chiltern Forest where trees were regularly felled.

The Baptist church was built by men of the village in 1802. The flints were apparently collected in their aprons by local women from surrounding fields, helped by their children. It is a Grade II listed building.

== Surrounding Lands and Population ==
The village is in the style of a traditional 18th century village. Its surroundings consists of a mixture of woodland and agricultural fields. Due to the geographical location of the village no railway station was built. There are approximately 165 houses in the village which has a population at the time of the 2011 census of 637 and has an estimated population of 654 in 2019.

== Speen Festival ==
The village hosts the &quot;Speen Festival&quot;, a culture and arts festival, in the September of odd-numbered years.

The first Speen Festival, in 2001, was based on a festival called &quot;The Leaves of Time&quot;, held in 1999 to celebrate the passing of the millennium.

== Notable residents ==
* In 1928 the artist Eric Gill moved to &quot;Pigotts&quot; at Speen, where he set up a printing press, and lettering workshop and alternative community. He is buried in the Baptist churchyard.
* The composer Edmund Rubbra lived at Valley Cottage, Highwood Bottom, Speen, for many years following his marriage in 1933.
* Ishbel MacDonald, the eldest daughter of Ramsay MacDonald, bought and then ran the pub, The Old Plow, for 17 years.
* In the 1960s physicist Bernard Robinson bought Pigotts and in 1966 transferred his amateur Music Camp activities there. (Music Camp, an influential annual gathering of amateur musicians who tackled challenging repertoire with the aid of many professional musicians, was previously held at Bothampstead in Berkshire, from 1935). 
* His son Nicholas Wheeler Robinson (1937-2022) was a teacher who continued to live at Pigotts and carried on Music Camp activities there.

<doc id="419296" wikidata="Q1138632" url="?curid=419296" title="Spadix (botany)">
<text>In botany, a spadix ( ; : spadices , ) is a type of inflorescence having small flowers borne on a fleshy stem. Spadices are typical of the family Araceae, the arums or aroids. The spadix is typically surrounded by a leaf-like curved bract known as a spathe. For example, the &quot;flower&quot; of the well known &quot;Anthurium&quot; spp. is a typical spadix with a large colorful spathe.

In this type of inflorescence, the peduncle is thick, long and fleshy, having small sessile unisexual flowers covered with one or more large green or colourful bracts (spathe). Spadix inflorescence is found in colocasia, aroids, maize and palms (palms have compound spadix).

Monoecious aroids have unisexual male and female flowers on the same individual and the spadix is usually organized with female flowers towards the bottom and male flowers towards the top. Typically, the stigmas are no longer receptive when pollen is released which prevents self-fertilization.

In the compound spadix inflorescence, the axis is branched. Usually the whole inflorescence is covered by a stiff boat-shaped hood, for example the coconut (palms).

In many arums with unisexual (imperfect) spadices, the upper portion of the spadix contains infertile male flowers and is referred to as the appendix. The appendix in certain species, such as &quot;Amorphophallus paeoniifolius&quot;, is enlarged, highly modified and shows variability in shape. In &quot;Arum maculatum&quot; the appendix length increases more rapidly with total spadix length than either the male or female zones.

Male florets and the appendix may participate in thermogenesis. The appendix may have additional specializations for odorant production.

<doc id="419298" wikidata="Q333159" url="?curid=419298" title="Jeremy Hanley">
<text>Sir Jeremy James Hanley, KCMG (born 17 November 1945) is a politician and former chartered accountant from the United Kingdom. He served as the Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1994 to 1995, and as a member of parliament (MP) representing the constituency of Richmond and Barnes from 1983 to 1997.

==Career==

Hanley was educated at Rugby School, and began his career with Peat Marwick Mitchell &amp; Company (now KPMG) as an articled clerk in 1963. He qualified as a chartered accountant in 1969, and as a Chartered Certified Accountant and chartered secretary in 1980. He joined the Financial Training Company, responsible for training chartered accountants, as a lecturer in Law and Accountancy (now Kaplan Financial Ltd), and rose to become the organisation&#x27;s deputy chairman.

Hanley stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative Party candidate in the 1978 Lambeth Central by-election, and for the same seat in the general election the following year, before becoming the MP for Richmond and Barnes at the 1983 general election, narrowly defeating the SDP–Liberal Alliance candidate Alan Watson. On his first day in the House of Commons he ended up sitting next to Ian Paisley and introduced himself saying: &quot;How do you do? I did not realise that you were on our side&quot;, to which Paisley replied: &quot;Never confuse sitting on your side with being on your side.&quot;

Hanley was the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Richard Luce from 1987 to 1990, and briefly the PPS to Chris Patten. He became an Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office in 1990, and a Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence in 1993.

In 1994, Hanley was brought into the Cabinet by Prime Minister John Major, who made him the Chairman of the Conservative Party and a minister without portfolio. He served in this position until the 1995 Cabinet reshuffle, when he was moved to the non-Cabinet role of Minister of State at the Foreign Office, where he remained until the 1997 general election.

Hanley&#x27;s Richmond and Barnes constituency was abolished as part of a redrawing of constituency boundaries ahead of the 1997 election. He stood as the Conservative candidate for the new constituency of Richmond Park, but was defeated by the Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Tonge.

Since leaving politics, Hanley has served on a number of company boards and as a director of the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce.

==Honours==
Hanley has been a member of the Privy Council since 1994. Hanley was awarded a knighthood in John Major&#x27;s farewell honours list in 1997. He is also a Freeman of the City of London, and Master of the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants.

==Personal life==

<text>Patricia Janet Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal, (born 19 August 1955), is a Dominican-British barrister and politician, serving as the sixth secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations. She was elected at the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and took office on 1 April 2016. She is the first woman to hold the post. 

She was elevated to the House of Lords in 1997 and, as a British Labour Party politician, served in ministerial positions within the UK Government, most notably as the Attorney General for England and Wales and Advocate General for Northern Ireland. She is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Dominica, where she was born.

==Early life and career==

Scotland was born on 19 August 1955 in Dominica, in the British Windward Islands. She was the tenth child of twelve born to Roman Catholic parents, a Dominican mother and Antiguan father. When she was two years old, her family emigrated to Walthamstow in north-east London, where she attended Chapel End Primary School and Walthamstow School for Girls. She then went on to Mid Essex Technical College in Chelmsford, where she obtained a University of London‘s Bachelor of Laws at University College London which at that time awarded the University of London’s qualifications. She was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1977, specialising in family law, and was called to the Dominican bar in 1978.

In 1991, Scotland was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. She later founded the (now closed) 1 Gray&#x27;s Inn Square barristers chambers. Early in 1997, she was elected as a Bencher of the Middle Temple. Scotland was named as a Millennium Commissioner on 17 February 1994, and was a member of the Commission for Racial Equality. She received a life peerage on a Labour Party list of working peers and was made Baroness Scotland of Asthal, &quot;of Asthal in the County of Oxfordshire&quot; on 30 October 1997.

==Politics==

From 1999 to 2001, Scotland was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where she was responsible, among others, for the UK Government&#x27;s diplomatic relations with North America, the Caribbean, Overseas Territories, Consular Division, British Council, administration and all Parliamentary business in the House of Lords. Scotland introduced the International Criminal Court Bill which sought to ratify the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court into UK law. 

In 2001, she became Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, and was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. She was the minister formally responsible for civil justice and the reform of civil law including the comprehensive reform of land registration leading to the Land Registration Act 2002. She was also formally responsible for international affairs at the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department and was appointed by Prime Minister Tony Blair as the UK Alternate Representative to the European Convention and was given primary responsibility for the negotiations in relation to the Charter of Rights which were successfully concluded in 2003. 

Scotland was an unsuccessful contender for a cabinet position in 2003, when Blair reportedly considered appointing her Leader of the House of Lords.

In 2003, Scotland was made Minister of State for the Criminal Justice System and Law Reform at the Home Office and deputy to the Home Secretary. She served in that post until 2007 under three Home Secretaries: David Blunkett, Charles Clarke and John Reid. 

===Attorney General===
On 28 June 2007, Scotland was appointed Attorney General by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. She was the first woman to hold the office since its foundation in 1315.

She was the last Attorney General for England and Wales also to be the Attorney General for Northern Ireland before the devolution of justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and appointment of a separate Attorney General for Northern Ireland. She became instead Advocate General for Northern Ireland, the UK government&#x27;s chief advisor on Northern Ireland law, for a brief period until Labour left office.

===Shadow Attorney General===

When Labour left government on 11 May 2010, Scotland became the Shadow Attorney General and was reappointed to that role by Ed Miliband when he appointed his first Shadow Cabinet in October 2010.

In November 2012, she was appointed Prime Ministerial Trade Envoy to South Africa.

===Local government===

In December 2014, Scotland was elected as the Alderman for the ward of Bishopsgate in the City of London, having stood (in accordance with convention in the City) as an independent candidate.

==Commonwealth Secretary-General==

At the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Scotland was nominated for the position of Commonwealth Secretary-General by her native country of Dominica and defeated Antiguan diplomat Ronald Sanders, who was thought to have been the frontrunner for the position, and former deputy secretary-general for political affairs Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba of Botswana to become the sixth Commonwealth Secretary-General and the first woman to hold the post. She began her first of a maximum of two possible four-year terms on 1 April 2016.

Her candidacy was opposed by retired Canadian senator Hugh Segal, formerly Canada&#x27;s special envoy to the Commonwealth and a member of the 2009—2011 Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group mandated to recommend reforms to improve Commonwealth governance, who wrote in an editorial that Scotland was not qualified for the position because she &quot;accepted a well-paying brief from a junta in the Maldives to argue against the Commonwealth&#x27;s legitimacy when it and Canada sought the restoration of democracy in that country.&quot;

Her bid to have her four-year term automatically renewed was rejected in June 2020, in contrast to the usual convention where an incumbent seeking a second term in office is elected unopposed for his or her second term. This followed a &quot;significant and diverse number of colleagues from across the Commonwealth&quot; raising objection to the proposal, due to allegations of cronyism following an audit of the Commonwealth Secretariat&#x27;s procurement practices. Her first term was extended, however, due to the postponement of the 2020 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

Scotland was re-elected to a second term at the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, reportedly defeating Jamaican foreign minister Kamina Johnson Smith by 27 votes to 24. As her first term had been extended by two years due to the pandemic and the postponement of the 2020 CHOGM, Scotland promised that she will only serve for two more years instead of a full four-year term.

In her capacity as Secretary General, Baroness Scotland performed a scripture reading at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey on 19 September 2022.

==Controversies==

===Illegal immigrant employment penalty===

In January 2009, Scotland employed Lolo Tapui, an illegal immigrant, as a cleaner. Tapui had been using a forged passport for the period up to and including December 2008. Tapui was later jailed for eight months for fraud, possessing a false identity stamp, and overstaying her UK visa. At her trial, Tapui admitted to having been paid £95,000 by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. She was later deported to her native Tonga.

Scotland, who was Attorney General at the time, had earlier been subjected to a penalty of £5,000 for employing Tapui. She had not kept copies of relevant documents to check Tapui&#x27;s immigration status and could therefore not establish a statutory defence. The rules were established when Scotland was a Home Office minister. The investigation by the UK Border Agency found that Scotland did not &quot;knowingly&quot; employ an illegal worker.

===Expenses controversy===

In November 2016, political blogger Guido Fawkes published purported extracts from leaked documents exposing Scotland&#x27;s extravagant spending on redecorating her grace and favour apartment in Mayfair, London. Scotland denied the claims in a statement posted on the Commonwealth&#x27;s website, insisting there had been &quot;no extravagance at all&quot; and explained that the spending was agreed by Kamalesh Sharma, the Commonwealth&#x27;s secretary-general from 2008 to 2016.

===Contract controversy===

In January 2020, Scotland faced further criticism of her role as secretary-general of the Commonwealth for awarding a consultancy contract to a company run by a friend. The Audit Committee of the international organisation noted that she offered a contract to a fellow Labour peer, Lord Patel of Bradford, despite his firm being &quot;apparently insolvent&quot; and &quot;circumventing&quot; the normal competitive tendering process. Auditors also found that procurement rules had not been observed by the secretariat on over 50 occasions.

=== Praise for Azerbaijan ===
Scotland has praised the authoritarian regime in Azerbaijan for its leadership on climate issues. In 2024, she attended an event in Baku organized by a newly created Azerbaijani NGO run by a businessperson with close ties to the authoritarian regime. At the event, she urged young Azerbaijanis to support their authoritarian government. She also laid flowers at the grave of Azerbaijani dictator Heydar Aliyev. She attended an event in 2015 at Baku’s Four Seasons Hotel launching a glossy book praising Azerbaijan&#x27;s state-owned oil company SOCAR.

==Awards==

Scotland was decreed and invested by Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, as a Dame of Merit with Star of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George in 2003. In 2014 she was appointed to the Council of the British and Irish Delegation of the Constantinian Order and promoted in rank to Dame Grand Cross of Merit. Scotland has been voted Peer of the Year by Channel 4, &quot;The House&quot; magazine, Parliamentarian of the Year by &quot;the Spectator&quot; and the Political Studies Association, and received a number of other awards for her contribution to law reform in the UK and abroad. Scotland was awarded an honorary degree from the University of East London in 2005. &quot;Powerlist&quot; ranked her as the most influential Black Briton in 2010, 2007 and 2008. On 1 January 2014, she was appointed chancellor of the University of Greenwich. In 2015, she was listed as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Women.

==Personal life==

Scotland resides in London and in Asthal, Oxfordshire, where she and her husband Richard Mawhinney, also a barrister, live with their two sons.

Scotland&#x27;s son Matthew Mawhinney has appeared on the reality series &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;. In 2021, he was arrested and fined for abusing cabin crew on a British Airways flight, including shouting &quot;Look up who my mum is – Baroness Scotland [...] go and get me a drink&quot; after being refused alcohol.

Scotland is the Patron of the Corporate Alliance Against Domestic Violence, Chineke! Foundation, Missio, and Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB).

<text>The Daytona 500 is an annual American stock car race sanctioned by the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and held every February at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. It was first held in 1959 after NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. wanted to take the sanctioning body away from the Daytona Beach and Road Course and onto a permanent racing facility to allow NASCAR races to continue being held in Daytona Beach. The event is the premier and final race of the three-week Speedweeks series of races and has been the first points-paying round of the NASCAR Cup Series since 1982. It usually covers 200 laps over a total distance of , but accidents and other incidents have meant that the race has been extended through the use of overtime rules on 13 occasions. Each winning driver is presented with a replica of the Harley J. Earl Trophy in Victory Lane, an estimated $2.5 million in prize money, a championship ring as well as a black leather jacket, and their car is put on display in race-winning condition in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America museum adjacent to the track for 12 months until the following year&#x27;s Daytona 500. 

In the 67 editions of the Daytona 500 that have occurred as of the 2025 race, 43 different drivers have won. The winner of the first race was Lee Petty in 1959, and the most recent victor was William Byron in 2025. Richard Petty holds the record for the most victories with seven, with Cale Yarborough in second place with four wins. Five drivers have won the event twice in a row, but no one has won three or more consecutively. Trevor Bayne and Bobby Allison are the youngest and oldest Daytona 500 winners, winning at the ages of 20 years and 1 day in 2011 and 50 years, 2 months, and 11 days old in 1988, respectively. Petty also holds the distinction of having the longest time between his first and last wins, 17 years between the 1964 and 1981 races. Buddy Baker and Junior Johnson set the record for the fastest and slowest race-winning average speeds of in 1980 and in 1960, respectively. Chevrolet have won the most races as a manufacturer with 27 since their first in 1960, followed by Ford in second with 17 victories. Hendrick Motorsports is the most successful race team with ten wins in total, followed by Petty Enterprises with nine wins.

<doc id="419308" wikidata="Q7177498" url="?curid=419308" title="Peter Viggers">
<text>Sir Peter John Viggers (13 March 1938 – 19 March 2020) was a British Conservative politician and lawyer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Gosport for 36 years, from 1974 to 2010. He stepped down as a result of the investigation of MPs&#x27; expenses.

==Early life==
Born in Gosport, Hampshire, he was the son of John Sidney Viggers. He was educated at Alverstoke School and Portsmouth Grammar School, a public school in Portsmouth. He studied at Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge, receiving an MA in History and Law in 1961. He qualified from the College of Law in Guildford in 1967. He became a solicitor in 1967.

==Career==

===Military service===
As part of National Service, Viggers was commissioned into the Royal Air Force on 8 January 1957 as an acting pilot officer. He was regraded to pilot officer on 8 January 1958, and promoted to flying officer on 18 May 1958. On 20 April 1958, he was transferred to the Reserve (national service list), ending his active service. He relinquished his commission in the Royal Air Force on 20 July 1963.

He then joined the Royal Artillery, Territorial Army, on 20 July 1963 as a lieutenant. He was given seniority in that rank from 20 July 1960. He was made acting captain on 13 January 1965 before being promoted to that rank on 13 March 1965. On 1 April 1967, he transferred to the Wessex Brigade, Territorial Army. At his request, he also reverted to the rank of lieutenant and was given seniority in that rank from 18 September 1960. He resigned from his commission on 31 March 1969, ending his military career.

===Politics===
Viggers was Member of Parliament for Gosport and lived just a few miles from where he was born. He was first elected in February 1974 and served as industry minister for Northern Ireland under Margaret Thatcher from 1986 to 1989. He left the ministry in 1989 and returned to the backbenches.

In 2002, he made headlines by suggesting that the European Union adopt a &quot;single European language&quot; to cut down on translation costs.

===Duck island scandal===
On 21 May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on Viggers&#x27; claims as part of its investigation of MPs&#x27; expenses, which it said showed Viggers was paid more than £30,000 for gardening expenses over three years. The paper noted in particular that Viggers had attempted to claim for a &quot;pond feature&quot; worth £1,645, which was identified as a &quot;floating duck island&quot;. However, it was unclear whether he had been reimbursed as an official had written &quot;not allowable&quot; next to it. On hearing the details of the story the &quot;Telegraph&quot; intended to run, Viggers announced late the previous night &quot;at the direct request&quot; of party leader David Cameron his intention to stand down at the next election. He also stood down from his role as spokesman for the Speaker&#x27;s Committee answering Parliamentary Questions for the Electoral Commission. On his website, however, he said about expenses: &quot;Personally, I have of course always scrupulously observed the rules&quot;.

The floating duck house, a symbol of the expenses scandal, was later sold at auction. It raised £1,700, handed over to the Macmillan Cancer charity. The claim was later referenced in the name of the 2013 farcical political satire &quot;The Duck House&quot; based on the UK parliamentary expenses scandal.

==Honours==
Viggers was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours &#x27;for services to Parliament&#x27;. He was knighted in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 14 October 2008 by Queen Elizabeth II.

===Business interests===
From 1970 to 1979, Viggers was chairman and director of banking, oil, hotels, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and venture capital companies. He was the chairman of Calgary-based Tracer Petroleum Corporation from 1996 to 1998, and of Lloyd&#x27;s Pension Fund from 1996. He was a director of Jakarta-based Emerald Energy plc from April 1998 to 2003.

==Personal life==
Viggers was a vice-patron of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He was also an honorary treasurer of the America All Party Parliamentary Group. He was chairman of governors at St Vincent College for four years.

In 1993, Viggers nearly drowned after being thrown into the English Channel, without a life jacket, in a yacht race in gale force winds. He credited his survival to &quot;closing my eyes and thinking of John Major&quot;.

He died on 19 March 2020 at the age of 82.

<doc id="419311" wikidata="Q7600294" url="?curid=419311" title="Stantonbury">
<text>Stantonbury is a district and civil parish of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, situated roughly north of Central Milton Keynes. The toponym &quot;Stanton&quot; is derived from an Old English term for &quot;stone-built farmstead&quot; and the &quot;bury&quot; element from the French family who held it in 1235. The original Stantonbury is a deserted medieval village now known as Stanton Low; the Stantonbury name has been reused for the modern district at the heart of the civil parish.

==Civil parish==
As well as Stantonbury itself, the civil parish of Stantonbury includes the districts of Bancroft and Bancroft Park, Blue Bridge, Bradville and Linford Wood. The population of the parish of Stantonbury grew from 19 at the 1971 census to 3,938 according to the 1981 census. By the time of the 2001 census its population had reached 9,010. At the 2011 census, it had 10,084 people.

===Bancroft ===
The residential Bancroft district is divided by Shenley Brook into Bancroft Park to the west and Bancroft to the east. The brook valley here is part of the flood control system and is a linear park for most of the year. There is a permanent wetland with associated plants and wildlife.

The foundations of a Romano-British farm known as Bancroft Roman Villa are in what is now the North Loughton Park, overlooking the Shenley Brook. Rescue excavations in 1957 identified a group of perhaps four buildings, traces of a hypocaust and sherds of Iron Age pottery. A section of mosaic flooring recovered from the site is in the &quot;guest services lounge&quot; of Central Milton Keynes shopping centre.

A copy of the famous &quot;Concrete Cows&quot; sculpture is at the southern end of the park (the original is in the Milton Keynes Museum). The &quot;Cows&quot; were originally sited here.

Bancroft is a haven for birds and one of the best places to see a common kingfisher. This is because of the wide variety of habitats the Parks Trust has created, from old grassland managed as wildflower meadows, through patches of thorn scrub to extensive marsh. cowslips and salad burnet flower in the spring, followed in summer to the customary flowers of traditional hay meadow: lady&#x27;s bedstraw and birdsfoot trefoil.

Bancroft pétanque Piste, which is near the Roman villa site, is provided by the Parks Trust free of charge. Also known as boules, pétanque is a traditional game played with steel balls on any sandy or gravelly surface across a large part of Europe.

The Bancrofts comprise just half the H2/H3/V5/V6 grid square, which is divided by the West Coast Main Line; the line is also the parish boundary, with Stacey Bushes (in Wolverton and Greenleys parish) on the other side of the tracks. Monks Way (H3, A422) bounds the parish from the neighbouring Bradwell.

===Blue Bridge===
This small district is mainly residential, near the West Coast Main Line and the Grand Union Canal (which separates it from Stonebridge, the rest of the grid square). It is also home to its own residential club, which it shares with Bancroft Park. The &#x27;Blue Bridge&#x27; (18345), now restricted to pedestrian and cycle traffic, is one of the oldest bridges over the West Coast Main Line and is a Grade II listed structure.

This district, between Bradwell, New Bradwell and Stantonbury itself, is mainly residential. The windmill is a Grade II listed building.
===Linford Wood===
As well as the ancient woodland that gives it its name, this district is mainly for high-tech industry. It is best known in Milton Keynes as the site of the telecommunications tower, for which it was chosen for its high elevation. It was originally part of the Linford demesne.

===Oakridge Park===
This small district of private housing development, part of the northern expansion of Milton Keynes outside its 1967 designated boundary, dates from about 2010. There is a small local centre with an Asda supermarket, a pharmacy and other small shops.

===Stantonbury===
This district lies north of Central Milton Keynes, between Great Linford and Wolverton, and south of Oakridge Park. It is largely residential, but the greater proportion of the area is taken up by two secondary schools (Stantonbury School and the Webber Independent School), a Theatre, leisure centre with a 25m swimming pool and an all-weather, competition standard, athletics track.

Modern Stantonbury lies on land historically known as &quot;Stanton High&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Stanton Low&quot;).
===Stanton Low===

Stanton Low lies near the River Great Ouse and is the deserted village of historic Stantonbury, one of the rural Buckinghamshire villages that were included in the area designated in 1967 to become Milton Keynes. Today this is an uninhabited agricultural area near the river. Little if anything remains of the deserted village other than the ruins of the parish church of St Peter. In the late 1950s the ruins of a Roman villa were discovered here, but were completely destroyed by gravel extraction.

==Church of St Peter==
The former Church of England parish church of Saint Peter in Stanton Low is Norman, with a mid-12th century nave and even earlier chancel. There was a squint in the south wall of the chancel, but this was later blocked. St. Peter&#x27;s was extensively rebuilt in the 13th century; the Decorated Gothic east window and piscina were added in the 14th century. By the latter part of the 17th century Stantonbury was almost deserted but the church was still in use; between 1668 and 1674 the Puritan poet and hymnwriter John Mason was its parish priest. In 1736 only four houses remained in the village, but St Peter&#x27;s was still in use in 1927 and John Piper painted a watercolour of it in about 1940. By 1955 the church had been disused for a number of years; the following year the roof collapsed. and was not repaired. By 1973 St. Peter&#x27;s was a ruin, and the east window and ornamented Norman chancel arch had been removed (in 1963, to the Church of St James in New Bradwell.) The building is a Grade II listed building.

Because the civil parish boundary runs along the canal, St Peter&#x27;s is actually in Haversham-cum-Little Linford civil parish.

<text>Steeple Claydon is a village and civil parish in the Buckinghamshire district of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about south of Buckingham, west of Winslow and northwest of Waddesdon. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,278.

==History==
The toponym &quot;Claydon&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;clay hill&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the area (including nearby Botolph Claydon, East Claydon and Middle Claydon) as &quot;Claindone&quot;. The affix &quot;steeple&quot; refers to the steeple of the Church of England parish church, which is prominent in the village. The manor of Steeple Claydon was once a royal possession. It was given as a wedding gift to Robert D&#x27;Oyly by King Henry I because D&#x27;Oyly was marrying one of the king&#x27;s former mistresses. Later, after changing hands several times it came into the possession of King Edward IV when his grandfather the Earl of March left it to him. The manor house has since been pulled down. Thomas Chaloner, a regicide, had a school built in the village in 1656. This site was later made into the public library.

==Present day==
Steeple Claydon is now one of the largest villages in Aylesbury Vale. It has a public house, a Co-op supermarket, a hairdresser, a fish &amp; chips shop, a Chinese Takeaway, a dentist, a doctor&#x27;s surgery and a garage. The village also has a successful football side, Steeple Claydon Football Club. The village has had some notable residents, including Florence Nightingale, Olympic swimmer Craig Gibbons, professional footballers Sam Baldock and George Baldock and Deep Purple founder member and guitarist Nick Simper.

The current Steeple Claydon School is a mixed, community primary school, with roughly 166 pupils ranging in age from four to eleven.

The HS2 Infrastructure Maintenance Depot is planned for Calvert, opening in 2029.

<doc id="419318" wikidata="Q11880942" url="?curid=419318" title="Mario Teaches Typing">
<text>Mario Teaches Typing is an educational video game developed and published by Interplay Productions for MS-DOS compatible operating systems, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh. The game uses the Mario character, licensed from Nintendo, to teach keyboard skills. A sequel to the game, &quot;Mario Teaches Typing 2&quot;, was developed by Brainstorm and published by Interplay in 1997.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; lets the player enter a name, select either Mario, Luigi, or Princess Peach as the player character, and set their target words per minute (WPM) rate. In the base mode, the player must type out a given text without additional decor. There are three difficulty levels of typing challenges based on &quot;Super Mario World&quot;: the chosen character continuously runs to the right until encountering an obstacle or enemy adorned with a letter (level 1), word (level 2), or sentence (level 3). Entering this string correctly allows the character to proceed. At the end of either mode, the game presents the player with statistics, including the reached WPM and error rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;PC Player 05/93&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Localized versions exist, such as a German release that supports QWERTZ keyboards and umlauts.

==Development and release==

&quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; was conceived and developed by Brian Fargo, at the time head of developer Interplay Entertainment and future founder of inXile Entertainment and Robot Cache. Fargo was acquaintances with Les Crane, a talk show host and radio announcer, who had also developed the educational typing game &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;. The game was successful and inspired Fargo to create a typing game of his own. Considering who could be the face and teacher of the game, he found Mario to be a good fit. Pitching the game to Nintendo, according to Fargo &quot;they loved it and it was a huge success&quot;. The CD-ROM version of the game was produced by Thomas R. Decker, a producer for Interplay whose past titles included &quot;Mario&#x27;s Game Gallery&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; reuses the title theme from &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. The game was released in the United States in 1992 and in the United Kingdom in 1993. The Macintosh version of the game was developed by Presage Software, who developed Mario&#x27;s Game Gallery.

Fargo told &quot;IGN&quot; in an interview that when he attended Crane&#x27;s talk show after the game&#x27;s release, he saw that Crane was &quot;giving me the stink eye&quot;. He called Crane afterward, who expressed disapproval of &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot;; the game was successful enough to become a direct competitor to &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;. According to Fargo, &quot;somebody else came out with some other Mario product that was not high quality&quot; for computers, resulting in Nintendo cutting ties with Interplay Entertainment.

In the CD version, Mario was voiced by Charles Martinet, which would be among his first times using the voice for a &quot;Mario&quot; video game. He also performed the motions and expressions for the character through virtual actor tracking sensors. Martinet considered &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; to be one of his favorite projects using the voice, as well as one of the most important; it helped him understand the character from a child&#x27;s perspective. He declared that Mario would never be in a negative headspace, and when he saw the script containing criticism for failing, such as &quot;Oh that wasn&#x27;t very good, try again&quot;, he insisted that the dialogue encourages the user to continue trying, such as, &quot;Not as good this time, but you&#x27;re gonna do it better this time, let&#x27;s go!&#x27;&quot;

==Reception==
Steve Fountain of the &quot;Evening Sentinel&quot; reviewed the Windows version, stating that &quot;&quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; is less fun than a normal computer game, but a whole lot better than ploughing through a dull typing manual&quot;. Heinrich Lenhardt, the co-editor-in-chief of &quot;PC Player&quot;, regarded the game as a competent alternative to ten-finger typewriter courses, although he believed its usefulness would be limited to hobbyists as it could not satisfy the needs of experienced typers like secretaries.

&quot;Electronic Games&quot; &quot;said &quot;If families are looking for only one typing program, Mario should be a serious contender&quot;.

&quot;The Oregonian&quot; said &quot;The program&#x27;s greatest appeal is that it provides a comfortable way of moving from the familiar world of video games into the sometimes intimidating world of home computers&quot;.

&quot;Macworld&quot; said &quot;The software challenges beginning, intermediate, and advanced typists with arcade games cum typing drills, recording and charting progress along the way&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; said &quot;Though it could never be as exciting as a typical Mario game, Teaches Typing featured pleasing sprites and a fair approximation of Nintendo&#x27;s signature style&quot;.

==Sales==
The game sold more than 800,000 copies. According to PC Data &quot;Mario Teaches Typing&quot; was the tenth best-selling game of June 1996 for Macintosh as well as the eight the top selling software in the first half of 1996 for Macintosh.

The game ranked 5th under Best Selling Educational software for the week ending Dec. 19, 1992 at Software Etc.

<text>Stewkley is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about east of Winslow and about west of Leighton Buzzard. The civil parish includes the hamlets of North End and Stewkley Dean.

The toponym Stewkley is derived from the Old English for &quot;woodland clearing with tree stumps.&quot; The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Stiuclai&quot;.

==History==
The principal manor in Stewkley was once held by the son of Geoffrey Chaucer, who was an occasional visitor to the village. The Church of England parish church of St Michael and All Angels is one of the least-altered of England&#x27;s 6,000 Norman churches. There is a Methodist chapel in High Street South. St Michael&#x27;s Church of England Combined School teaches children aged 4–11.

Stewkley has one of, if not, the longest village high streets in Britain at 2 miles long, a title also claimed by Combe Martin in Devon, whose 1.5 mile (previously thought to be 2 miles) long high street is not as continuously populated as Stewkley&#x27;s high street. Southeast of the village is Aylesbury Vale Golf Club.

In World War 2, the village was a popular destination for personnel serving at nearby RAF Wing.

==Campaign against London&#x27;s third airport==
In 1968 the Roskill Commission was charged with looking into finding a site for London&#x27;s third airport. The report was published in 1970, with the proposal that Stewkley would be destroyed along with some other nearby villages. However two local residents, Desmond Fennell and Bill Manning, set up the Wing Airport Resistance Association (WARA), which successfully campaigned against the proposal. A Monument, known as the Airport Monument and Spinney was erected in Stewkley to mark the successful campaign.

==Notable people==
*Alastair Cook, England cricket captain, was married at the Methodist Chapel on 31 December 2011.
*Arthur Hughes, actor, known for his roles in &quot;The Innocents&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Archers&quot;.
*The Earl and Countess of Orkney lived at Tythe House.
*Darren Gough, former England cricketer, previously lived in and played football for the village.
*Al Murray, stand-up comedian, best known for his persona &quot;The Pub Landlord&quot;, was born in Grove Cottage on High Street South.

<text>The Selecter is an English 2 tone ska revival band, formed in Coventry, England, in 1979.

The Selecter featured a diverse line-up, both in terms of race and gender, initially consisting of Arthur &#x27;Gaps&#x27; Hendrickson and Pauline Black on lead vocals, Neol Davies and Compton Amanor on guitar, Desmond Brown on Hammond organ, Charley &#x27;Aitch&#x27; Bembridge on drums, and Charley Anderson on bass. The band&#x27;s name comes from the original &quot;The Selecter&quot; track, which appeared on the flip side of The Special AKA&#x27;s &quot;Gangsters&quot; single in 1979, and was written by Neol Davies and John Bradbury, produced by Roger Lomas and featured Barry Jones on trombone.

The band were one of the most successful ska bands of the 2 tone era, notching up several top forty singles in the UK Singles Chart. Having co-released the first 2 tone ska single with the Specials, they were one of the founding acts of the movement. Though influential, the original lineup only remained together for a year, and even with replacement players the band continued until breaking up in 1981.

The Selecter reformed in 1991 with original members Neol Davies and Pauline Black, along with Bad Manners members Martin Stewart, Nick Welsh and Perry Melius. Davies left the band in 1993, but lead vocalist Black continued to perform and release music under the Selecter name until 2006.

By 2011, another version of the band featuring Neol Davies was touring separately. In June 2011 Black applied for, and won, the Selecter trademark and the right to use the name herself. The reformed, Pauline Black-led line-up still tours and releases albums under the Selecter name, most recently releasing &quot;Human Algebra&quot;, the band&#x27;s 16th studio album, in 2022.

==History==
In 1977, Neol Davies and John Bradbury (who later became a member of the Specials), with the trombone player Barry Jones, recorded a track in a recording session in 1977–78 that resulted in &quot;Kingston Affair&quot;, which was produced by Coventry producer Roger Lomas. It was initially credited to &#x27;The Selecters&#x27; and although the record was touted around the industry, there were no takers and it remained on the shelf until 1979, when it was released as &quot;The Selecter&quot; as a double a-side with the Special AKA&#x27;s recording &quot;Gangsters&quot;, the first 2 Tone Records single. It was released in March 1979, reaching 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was written by Davies and Bradbury.

After the success of the single, Davies put a band together to capitalise on the success of the single. He had recently been playing in Transposed Men with keyboard player Desmond Brown and Brown joined the band, along with bass player Charley Anderson, guitarist Compton Amanor, drummer Aitch Bembridge and vocalist Gaps Hendrickson. All the musicians had played on the local scene in Coventry for a number of years with bands such as The Ray King Soul Band, Hard Top 22 and others. The seven piece line-up for the original band was completed when Pauline Black was spotted by Davies. Davies offered Pauline an audition with the Selecter – she joined along with other members in July 1979.

The new band released the singles &quot;On My Radio&quot;, &quot;Three Minute Hero&quot; and &quot;Missing Words&quot;, written by Davies. The Selecter&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Too Much Pressure&quot;, was recorded at the end of 1979 and beginning of the new year, and was released in February 1980 by 2 Tone Records and Chrysalis Records. Anderson and Brown left the Selecter in 1980 to form the People. Their replacements were James Mackie and Adam Williams. Their second studio album, &quot;Celebrate the Bullet&quot; was released in February 1981 and the title track has a music video that aired on MTV&#x27;s first day of broadcast, before Black left the band to pursue a solo career. A short time after, unsuccessfully having tried Stan Campbell as the singer, the rest of the members disbanded. The Selecter were featured in the 2 Tone film documentary and on the live compilation album &quot;Dance Craze&quot; (1981).

==Post break-up years==
===Pauline Black===
Black left the band in 1981 to pursue a solo career. That solo career was ultimately short-lived and Black pursued a career in theatre, television and film.

From 1991 she led a reformed Selecter for 15 years releasing several new albums. In 2006 she took a sabbatical from the Selecter, to write her memoirs &quot;Black by Design&quot; for publishing house Serpent&#x27;s Tail. In 2009, she returned to the live arena, playing shows in the UK, Germany and South America guesting with various ska musicians and performing songs from the Selecter&#x27;s first two studio albums. During her sabbatical, Black recorded a new 13-track solo album, &quot;Pigment of My Imagination&quot;, though it remains unreleased. She later reformed the Selecter, this time with guest original lead singer Arthur &quot;Gaps&quot; Hendrickson, and in 2010 they played two shows at the Sinner&#x27;s Day Festival at the Ethias Arena in Hasselt, Belgium, and at the Bloomsbury Ballroom in London.

===Neol Davies===
Neol Davies penned all of the Selecter&#x27;s hit singles. He started up his own home studio after the band disbanded in 1981 to write and record his own new songs, and he played a number of local shows in the Midlands while teaching guitar in local schools. Davies formed a new version of the Selecter in 1991 with Black, before he left the band two years later. He started up a new outfit called Selecter Instrumental, mostly playing movie tunes in a ska style. In the early 1990s, he joined a reunited Specials in the studio, contributing rhythm guitar to sessions that would later be released as the cover albums &quot;Skinhead Girl&quot; (2000) and &quot;Conquering Ruler&quot; (2001). In 1998, he released his debut solo studio album &quot;Box of Blues&quot;, assisted by bass player Horace Panter of the Specials and drummer Anthony Harty, and the trio often performed at a number of blues concerts in the UK. He later recorded another solo studio album, &quot;Future Swamp&quot; (2002), with guests including Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and Reef members Dominic Greensmith and Jason Knight. Both albums were released on Davies&#x27; own label, VoMatic Records. He later led his own version of The Selecter from 2010 to 2012 and occasionally guested on stage with The Neville Staple Band between 2019 and 2021.

===Charley Anderson===
Charley Anderson moved to Sweden during the 1990s where he performed, recorded and released material with the Skalatones. In 2009, Anderson returned to Coventry to play a charity concert at the Central Hall to promote his Ghetto Child project. Joining him on stage were guests from UB40, the Specials, the Selecter along with saxophonist Carlos Garnett.

===Aitch Bembridge===
Charley &#x27;Aitch&#x27; Bembridge has been involved with the All Skas, a ska band which performed in the Midlands. He also served as drummer in the Specials through their first reunion, both live and in the studio, from 1993 through to 1998. He re-joined Black and Hendrickson&#x27;s version of the band in 2021.

===Gaps Hendrickson===
Hendrickson later re-joined The Selecter in 1994, remaining until 1996. He occasionally performed on stage with local Coventry bands, including Special Brew and also worked as a security guard in the city. Hendrickson died at his home in Coventry from a brief illness on 11 June 2024 at the age of 73, after having been diagnosed with cancer the prior year.

===30th Anniversary of 2 Tone celebrations===
Davies, Hendrickson, Anderson and Black were also involved with unveiling commemorative plaques for the 30th anniversary of 2 Tone on significant buildings associated with the record label in Coventry.

==Reunions==

Davies and Black reunited towards the end of the 1980s, performing as a duo, with Davies on electric guitar and Black on vocals. The pair featured on an episode of a Jools Holland music show that was broadcast on European satellite television. Then, in 1990, after two guest spots with Bad Manners, and being genuinely surprised by the reception they received, Black and Davies reformed the Selecter with three members of Bad Manners, Martin Stewart, Nick Welsh and Perry Melius, in 1991.

After releasing a new version of &quot;On My Radio&quot;, backed up with a new version of &quot;The Selecter&quot; and performing some tours, Davies departed the band in 1993. From 1994 to 1996, another original member, Arthur &#x27;Gaps&#x27; Hendrickson, performed with this line-up occasionally. They released several new albums, toured around the world and toured with No Doubt in 1997 in the US. 1998&#x27;s politically-focused &quot;Cruel Britannia&quot; was critically acclaimed. Black continued to record and perform as the Selecter up until 2006, and from 2010 to the present.

On 31 October 2010, Pauline Black and Arthur &#x27;Gaps&#x27; Hendrickson played under the Selecter name to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the seminal debut studio album, &quot;Too Much Pressure&quot; (1980), by performing the whole album live at the Sinners Day Festival, Ethias Stadium, Hasselt, Belgium. They also performed at the Bloomsbury Ballroom, London, in November 2010. In her capacity as lead singer of the Selecter, Black featured prominently in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Reggae Britannia&quot; series in February 2011 and the televised &#x27;Reggae Britannia Concert&#x27; at the Barbican, London, alongside Ken Boothe, Neville Staple and Brinsley Forde of Aswad.

The Selecter reunited once again when the band travelled over to Belfast, Northern Ireland, to play a show in the capital&#x27;s annual Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival. This was followed by an extensive tour of the UK, Europe, and in October 2014, New Zealand and Australia.

In June 2015, the band released &quot;Subculture&quot; mixed by Mike &quot;Prince Fatty&quot; Pelanconi on DMF Records. They toured the UK in 2015 and Black and Hendrickson were special guests on a number of dates with Jools Holland&#x27;s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra including at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in November.

In October 2017, the band released a new studio album &quot;Daylight&quot;.

In 2022, The Selecter were due to tour the UK performing their second studio album &quot;Celebrate the Bullet&quot; (1981) in its entirety. However, the tour was postponed until 2023 and only select tracks from that album ended up being performed.

After a 2022 interview with 89-year-old Barry Jones appeared in the &quot;2 Tone - Before, During &amp; After&quot; fanzine, Davies contacted Jones and, in May 2023, Davies, Jones and Lomas, the surviving musicians and producer to have been involved with the original &quot;Kingston Affair&quot; track, reunited in Coventry.

The trio initially met up at Lomas&#x27; house and then made an appearance at The 2 Tone Village in the city. An in-depth article on the reunion was featured in the June 2023 edition of the fanzine, where Jones credited the fanzine with setting the whole thing in motion and also for giving him &quot;a new lease of life&quot;.

==Style==
===Music===
The Selecter were &quot;one of the key bands&quot; of 2 tone music, the late 1970s and early 1980s genre that mixed ska with the energy of punk rock. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Too Much Pressure&quot; (1980), exemplifies the band&#x27;s 2 Tone sound, mixing ska, reggae and punk rock styles. Adding influences from new wave music, the record&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Celebrate the Bullet&quot; (1981) was broodier than its predecessor, featuring a less intense, slower sound. After reuniting in the 1990s, the band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;The Happy Album&quot; (1994) saw a stylistic deviation; while keeping ska as its base, the record explored contemporary rhythms and influences from genres such as hip hop and flourishes of orchestral music, incorporating sampling while occasionally slowing down to a reggae tempo. One critic said the record is &quot;roughly parallel for the memory of 2- Tone what Big Audio Dynamite did for punk.&quot;

The band scaled back somewhat with its follow-up album &quot;Pucker!&quot; in 1995, which displayed a new blend of ska with elements from new wave and power pop, as well as other atypical touches such as, on one song, pedal steel guitar. &quot;Cruel Britainnia&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album from 1998, was heralded as a return to the band&#x27;s 2 tone sound, and &quot;The Trojan Songbook&quot; series of cover albums from the turn of the century were predominately in a reggae style. The band also recorded several acoustic albums, namely &quot;Unplugged for the Rude Boy Generation&quot; (2002) and &quot;Requiem for a Black Soul&quot; (2004), which brought &quot;ska into the fashionable acoustic field.&quot; When the band reunited in the 2010s, they used ska and reggae rhythms on &quot;Made in Britain&quot; (2011) and its follow-up &quot;String Theory&quot; (2013).

===Lyrics===
The band were among the few racially and sexually mixed 2 tone bands and Black&#x27;s lyrics, in a similar vein to several other 2 tone bands, covered numerous social ills, including sexism and most prominently racism. While &quot;Too Much Pressure&quot; (1980) featured politically conscious lyrics, &quot;Celebrate the Bullet&quot; (1981) was darker and tenser, likewise featuring racial and social issues as themes while also concerning itself with &quot;cold war paranoia and fear for the future.&quot; &quot;The Happy Album&quot; (1994) was similarly &quot;burdened by a social conscience,&quot; whereas the lyrics on &quot;Pucker!&quot; (1995) were generally more uncharacteristically sunny and lightweight. With &quot;Made in Britain&quot; in 2011, the band &quot;wanted to have a conversation basically about where The Selecter was at, where we were at in relation to 2 Tone.&quot; The record largely addressed the advent of multiculturalism and the legacy of 2 tone&#x27;s equality message in the 21st century. For &quot;String Theory&quot; (2013), the band extended from these themes, observing how people &quot;celebrate their differences more than they celebrate the things that unite us,&quot; and named the album in relation to the string theory being a metaphor for connection between humans.

<doc id="419324" wikidata="Q3275" url="?curid=419324" title="David Cairns (politician born 1966)">
<text>John David Cairns (7 August 1966 – 9 May 2011) was a Scottish politician who served as Minister of State for Scotland from 2005 to 2008. A member of Scottish Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Inverclyde, formerly Greenock and Inverclyde, from 2001 until his death in 2011.

==Early life==
Cairns was born and raised in Greenock. He attended Notre Dame High School in the town, before training for the Roman Catholic priesthood at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He continued his studies at the Franciscan International Centre in Canterbury.

From 1991 to 1994 he served as a priest in Clapham. He left the priesthood in 1994 and became director of the Christian Socialist Movement. In 1997 he became a research assistant to newly elected Labour MP, Siobhain McDonagh until he himself became an MP in 2001. In 1998 he was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Merton where he served until 2002.

==Parliamentary career==
Cairns had ambitions to enter House of Commons but was barred due to the Removal of Clergy Disqualification Act 1801 and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 which prevented present or former Catholic priests from being elected to Parliament. To rectify this, Siobhain McDonagh MP introduced the House of Commons Disqualification (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 16 June 1999, but the bill failed. The government subsequently introduced the House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Bill, which removed almost all restrictions on clergy of whatever denomination from sitting in the House of Commons. The only exception is the 26 Church of England (Anglican) bishops who sit as Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords, as a person may not sit in both Houses at once. The bill passed on 11 May 2001.

Cairns had already been selected as the Labour candidate in his home town following the retirement of Norman Godman. He was elected as the Labour MP for Greenock and Inverclyde at the 2001 general election with a majority of 9,890, becoming the first person born in Greenock to represent it in Parliament. He made his maiden speech on 4 July 2001.

Cairns was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions Malcolm Wicks in 2003, and following the 2005 general election, at which, due to the redrawing of boundaries his constituency was abolished and replaced with a larger Inverclyde constituency, he became a member of the Labour government as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. He then had the Northern Ireland Office added to his responsibilities and in 2007 he became the Minister of State for Scotland. He played a high profile role in the media as the principal defender of Scotland&#x27;s role in the United Kingdom in opposition to the movement for Scottish independence. Cairns was Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, and while he gave up the position when becoming a junior minister, he remained a committed member of the group.

On 16 September 2008, Cairns resigned from the government during arguments in the Labour party over Gordon Brown&#x27;s leadership, saying that the time had come to &quot;allow a leadership debate to run its course&quot;. He was the only minister to resign after rebel MPs began calling for a leadership contest. The &quot;Guardian&quot; later called it &quot;a principled decision by a principled politician&quot;. In the 2010 general election, Cairns was returned as Member of Parliament for his constituency of Inverclyde with a majority of 14,416, which was an increase on his previous election.

==Personal life and death==
Cairns was openly gay, and at the time of his death, was in a relationship with Dermot Kehoe.

In March 2011, Cairns was hospitalised in London for acute pancreatitis, and died at Royal Free Hospital on 9 May 2011, at the age of 44.

<doc id="419326" wikidata="Q1791360" url="?curid=419326" title="Stoke Goldington">
<text>Stoke Goldington is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about four miles NNW of Newport Pagnell, on the road to Northampton.

==History==

The village name &#x27;Stoke&#x27; derives from the Old English &#x27;stoc&#x27;, which means &#x27;place&#x27;. It came to be used in the context of either a religious or a secondary settlement, and is one of the most common place name elements in England (see Stoke (disambiguation)). In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Stoche&quot;. The affix &#x27;Goldington&#x27; came later and refers to &quot;Peter de Goldington&quot; (from Goldington in Bedfordshire) who held the manor in the early thirteenth century.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has one grade I listed building, and 33 at grade II.

==Parish church==
The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and is a grade I listed building. The earliest parts of the building date from the 12th century.

==Flooding==
Stoke Goldington is susceptible to occasional flooding, and suffered badly in 2007 with repeated floods. Water settled up to 1.5 metres deep in places, requiring the evacuation of some of the population. Subsequently, contractors for Milton Keynes City Council installed measures to reduce the flood risk. In May 2018, there was another flood, that overcame the new flood defences.

<doc id="419331" wikidata="Q7565435" url="?curid=419331" title="South African Breweries">
<text>South African Breweries (officially The South African Breweries Limited, informally SAB) is a major brewery headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa and was a wholly owned subsidiary of SABMiller until its interests were sold to Anheuser-Busch InBev on 10 October 2016. South African Breweries is now a direct subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.

The company that is now South African Breweries was founded in 1895 as Castle Brewery to serve a growing market of miners and prospectors in and around Johannesburg. Two years later, it became the first industrial company to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the year after (1898) it listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 1950, SAB relocated its headquarters and control from London to South Africa. In 1955, Castle Brewing purchased the Ohlsson&#x27;s and Chandlers Union breweries, and the group was renamed South African Breweries.

From the early 1990s onward, the company increasingly expanded internationally, making several acquisitions in both emerging and developed markets. In 1999, it formed a new UK-based holding company, SAB plc, and moved its primary listing to London. In May 2002, SAB plc acquired Miller Brewing, forming SABMiller plc.

On 10 October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller for £69 billion (US$107 billion at the time the deal closed). The arrangement had been approved by shareholders of both companies on 28 September 2016, and the deal closed on 10 October 2016. The acquisition ended the corporate use of the name SABMiller. After the deal closed, the new company&#x27;s name changed slightly, to Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (abbreviated as AB InBev); it is trading as ABI on the Brussels Stock Exchange, as BUD on the New York stock exchange and as ANH on the Johannesburg market. SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets.

== Acquisition of SABMiller by ABinBev ==
The acquisition of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev on 10 October 2016 ended the corporate use of the name SABMiller except as a business division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev). The new entity began trading on the Brussels Stock Exchange as ABI.BR and as BUD on the New York stock exchange. SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.

On 21 December 2016, the company agreed to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Eastern Europe to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. Anheuser-Busch InBev had previously agreed to sell Grolsch Brewery, Peroni Brewery and Meantime Brewery to Asahi; that deal closed on 12 October 2016. On the same day, the sale of SABMiller&#x27;s 49 percent share in Snow beer to China Resources Enterprise also closed.

In December 2016, the Coca-Cola Company bought the Coca-Cola operations in Africa and in two Central American countries. The deal requires regulatory approval and should close by the end of 2017.

In August 2016, after the plans for acquiring SABMiller had been established by Anheuser-Busch InBev, the company said it would close SABMiller&#x27;s regional offices in Miami, Hong Kong and Beijing after the acquisition deal closed in October 2016. Plans had not yet been revealed for the operation in Zug, Switzerland which controlled SABMiller&#x27;s central &amp; eastern European beer brands. However, the subsequent sale of much of the business in such countries to Asahi Breweries may affect the Zug operation. The office in Woking (United Kingdom) was expected to remain open for a transitional period but the HQ in London&#x27;s Stanhope Gate would close. The South African Breweries office in Johannesburg will remain open and will also be used by Anheuser Busch InBev SA/NV (whose corporate HQ is in Leuven, Belgium) as its Africa hub.

== Board of directors, management and staffing ==
Since SABMiller had been acquired on 10 October 2016, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, there was no longer a need for a board of directors for the former SABMiller. In August 2017, Anheuser Busch InBev had announced that Mauricio Leyva, then the CEO of SAB South Africa, would be the only executive to remain with Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV on the new entity&#x27;s 18 member permanent board. Leyva would become zone president for Middle Americas at Anheuser Busch Inbev SA/NV. News reports indicated that &quot;three ... SABMiller executive committee members - general counsel John Davidson, human resources head Johann Nel and Africa MD Mark Bowman - [would] stay on for a six-month transitional period only&quot;.

South African Breweries (SAB) remains an entity, as a subsidiary of SAB InBev. According to Bloomberg, Grant Murray Liversage was the Finance Director of South African Breweries Limited after the takeover by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. Mauricio Leyva Arboleda, currently employed by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV and Dinyar S. DeVitre were board members of SAB.

Before the 10 October 2016 acquisition of SABMiller, in April 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev had agreed to protect South African jobs and create a 1 billion rand (US$69 million) fund that would &quot;support farmers, local manufacturing, jobs, and the reduction of harmful alcohol use,&quot; including funding new barley and hops farms. This offer was made to convince the regulators to approve the sale of SABMiller.

The company is bound by an agreement with the South African Competition Tribunal that employment numbers at South African Brewery will be stable for five years and that there will be no forced reductions of staff and that unionized employees will not be offered voluntary separation for five years.

However, AB InBev decided to attempt some cost savings by offering voluntary severance offers to some management level staff at SAB. On 23 January 2017, Robyn Chalmers, Director of Communications, AB InBev Africa and SAB, said that &quot;... no employee will be forcibly retrenched as a result of the merger. It is too early in the process to say how many people may opt for the voluntary offer.&quot; She added that the offer &quot;has been made available only to mid-level employees and above&quot;. Since the company must maintain the staffing level, highly paid managers will probably be replaced by staff at lower levels.

==History==
===Brewing in South Africa===

Prior to incorporation in the year 1895, Castle Brewery had operations in Cape Town to serve the steady expansion of a settler community from the mid-17th century. The demand for beer prompted the first Dutch governor, Jan van Riebeeck, to establish a brewery at the Fort (later replaced by the Castle in central Cape Town) as early as 1658 - beating the first wine production by six months. In the same year, Pieter Visagie brewed the first beer from the waters of the Liesbeeck River. Over the next 200 years, brewing made its mark in the Cape and beyond. Noted brewers of the time included Cloete at the Newlands Brewery; Ohlsson at the Anneberg Brewery; Jacob Letterstedt at Mariendahl Brewery - also in Newlands: Hiddingh at Cannon Brewery; Martienssen at the Salt River Brewery, and a second Cloete in Kloof Street.

One of the key figures in the story of Newlands, and in the annals of South African beer manufacturing history, was Swede Anders Ohlsson, who sailed for Africa, aged 23, in 1864. Initially, he imported Swedish goods and timbers, and developed an extensive trade network and a solid business empire. Then he turned to brewing, basing himself at Newlands, where he produced Lion Lager.

In 1955, the South African government introduced a heavy tax on beer products causing many consumers to switch to spirits. However, the subsequent shock to the South African beer industry proved to be a blessing in disguise for SAB. A year later, the company purchased its two main competitors, Ohlsson&#x27;s and Chandlers Union Breweries, both of whom were struggling under the depressed demand for beer, and the group was renamed South African Breweries.

After the acquisitions the new and larger SAB was able to rationalize operations, thereby reducing costs and increasing profitability. 
Donald Gordon&#x27;s Liberty Life Strategic Investments (LIBSIL), which was associated with JSE-listed financial services and property holding company Liberty Holdings, maintained a large stake in the company for most of the 1990s.
By 1998, SAB commanded approximately 98 per cent share of the South African beer market and was considered one of the lowest cost producers of beer in the world.

In 1999, after listing on the London Stock Exchange to raise capital for acquisitions, the group purchased the Miller Brewing Company in North America from the Altria Group in 2002, and changed its name to SABMiller.

Within South Africa, SAB distributes beer through its extensive network, augmented by a fleet of independent truck drivers (called owner-drivers) comprising mainly former employees, many of whom had received help from the group to start their own businesses. SAB has invested billions of rands in this owner-driver project since inception.

Although several international brewers, such as the UK&#x27;s Whitbread, had tried to enter the South African market, all had thus far failed to gain significant market share. From time to time, new startups also tried to challenge SAB&#x27;s monopoly, but these had either gone out of business, or been acquired by SAB. A case in point was National Sorghum Breweries (NSB), &quot;a black business consortium&quot; founded in 1990, and the first new player in the beer industry in more than 10 years. &quot;SAB’s supremacy is under threat,&quot; observers said, and some thought that within a few years NSB could achieve 10 per cent market share. Instead, the company ran into financial difficulties and failed to gain any significant share of the market.

This does not mean that SAB&#x27;s position could never be threatened. In 2004, a new company was established in South Africa known as Brandhouse through a joint venture of Diageo, Heineken and Namibian Breweries. Brandhouse started marketing, selling and distributing some of the world&#x27;s top premium brands such as Heineken and Windhoek and in March 2007, the 40-year agreement between SABMiller plc and Heineken N.V. which allowed SAB Ltd to brew and distribute Amstel Lager in South Africa, was terminated, sparking a new era of competition for the industry. At the same time, Heineken announced its intention to build its own brewery in South Africa. 
SAB Ltd launched a new premium brand, Hansa Marzen Gold shortly thereafter and continued its expansion into premium brands with the launch of Dutch heritage beer, Grolsch, following SABMiller&#x27;s acquisition of Koninklijke Grolsch N.V. in early 2008. Dreher Premium Lager was launched in South Africa the same year, and the company has made a number of innovations in the spirit cooler and apple-ale categories in recent years.

In October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired the entire SABMiller company which then became a business division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV and ceased trading on the worldwide stock markets. As a result, South African Breweries and Carlton &amp; United are now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.

*Polokwane Brewery, Limpopo, 
*Prospecton Brewery, KwaZulu-Natal,

===Soft drinks===
In 1925, SAB expanded into other beverages after purchasing a large share in Schweppes (soft drinks). In 1960, the group purchased a controlling interest in Stellenbosch Farmer&#x27;s Winery, which, along with Distillers Corporation, contributed R98 million to group earnings in 1997.

1997, SAB subsidiary, Amalgamated Beverage Industries, purchased another Coca-Cola bottler, Suncrush, thereby doubling market share to approximately 60 per cent of South African soft drinks. PepsiCo, SAB&#x27;s only competitor, withdrew from the market in 1997 resulting in the liquidation of Pepsi franchisees. Pepsi, however, re-entered the South African market in 2006.

In December 2004, SAB Ltd acquired 100% of Amalgamated Beverage Industries Limited (ABI), which became the soft drink division of SAB Ltd, and the largest beverage company in South Africa was created.

===Plate glass===
In 1917, the group began to venture into unrelated businesses when it agreed to take over a failed glass manufacturer, Union Glass, to counter the acute shortage of bottles during World War I. In 1954, Union Glass merged with Consolidated Glassworks and this business was sold off in 1960 to Anglovaal Industries. The company became an important player in international glass manufacturing when it acquired the Plate Glass Group in 1992.

The Plate Glass Group traced its roots to a British immigrant and entrepreneur who, in 1897, established a plate glass manufacturing operation in Cape Town, South Africa. Eventually the company became a leading producer of safety and bullet-proof glass for automobiles. In 1987 the company launched a new subsidiary in the United States in partnership with SAB and Anglo American. When Glass medic, a US-based windshield repair and replacement company, was acquired in 1990, the South African parent company merged the subsidiaries under the name Belron International. Belron became a base from which to launch further acquisitions. When SAB purchased Plate Glass in 1992, it was renamed Shatterprufe Limited.

Belron had by 1998 become the world&#x27;s leading producer of automotive replacement glass, with some 1,865 retail outlets in North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil. Growth had come mainly through acquisitions. In 1997, Belron acquired several leading brands, including Standard Autoglass in Canada, thereby becoming &quot;the largest player in the North American Markets.&quot; Worldwide market share was on the order of 18%, and SAB envisioned further expansion in the coming years:

In Europe, Belron was opening an average of 12 new outlets per month. While sales had increased by five per cent in 1997, earnings had declined eight per cent to R255 million as a result of the borrowing costs associated with new acquisitions and expansion.

In 1997, recognising the need to enhance long-term shareholder value, SAB returned to its core beverage business, locally and internationally, selling off or closing non-core operations over the next few years. Amongst these was the Plate Glass business.

===Entertainment and hospitality===
Although SAB (then called Castle Breweries) had established the first pub in South Africa in 1896, it did not begin to invest heavily in service industries until 1949 when an aggressive expansion thrust saw some £4.5 million invested in hotels and pubs, as well as additional brewing facilities.

In 1969, these interests were merged with a hotel chain owned by Sol Kerzner, to form a separate subsidiary known as Southern Sun Hotels. Kerzner remained with Southern Sun as its managing director for several years thereafter. In 1983 Kerzner left SAB, but remained a significant shareholder in the company.

Southern Sun eventually grew to become the leading hotel chain in South Africa, with franchises awarded by Holiday Inn and Inter-continental Hotels. By 1998, this subsidiary owned 74 hotels with 12,200 rooms, or about 22 per cent of industry capacity. Southern Sun also maintained a minority interest in an eco-tourism company.

Development of new hotels depended on securing licences from the government, &quot;as the state still owned large tracts of land in both urban and rural areas.&quot; Suitable locations for hotel and resort development were very limited, and local government officials often did not have the training and expertise needed to make informed decisions about the granting of such licences. Resulting delays resulted in significant costs.

Several international hotel chains decided to enter South Africa after the lifting of economic sanctions. By 1998, numerous hotels were under construction by Hyatt, Sheraton, Howard Johnson&#x27;s, Days Inn, Hilton, Best Western, Concorde (France), Le Meridian (France), and Relais de Chateau (France), among others. Most new hotel development was in the executive and luxury segments of the market. In less than four years, industry-wide capacity had more than doubled, and as a result, the hotel industry began to experience significant over-supply. Combined with a weak currency, this translated into some of the lowest room rates in the world.

Although escalating levels of violent crime had been a serious constraint for South African tourism, Southern Sun had been able to maintain an average occupancy above 70%. In 1997, hotel earnings increased by 16% over the previous year to contribute R182 million to group earnings.

The government introduced the National Gambling Act in 1996, which allowed for up to 40 casino licenses to be issued to &quot;financially competent operators.&quot; In 1997, SAB entered into a joint-venture with Tsogo Sun Gaming and Entertainment to establish up to eight casino resorts to be completed as early as 2000. Monte Casino was the first of these developments to be completed at an expected construction cost of $US250 million.

The most notable black empowerment transaction facilitated by SAB was Tsogo Investments in early 2003. The transaction, which had an implied value of approximately R1.9-billion, meant that empowerment group Tsogo Investments acquired control of Southern Sun Hotels, then the largest hotel group in southern Africa as well as Tsogo Sun, a leading casino operator in South Africa.

===Other manufacturing and retail===
Further diversification came in 1967 with the establishment of a new subsidiary known as Food Corporation (coffee, tea, and food products). An even larger diversification push was undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s, when the SAB group of companies purchased or established numerous unrelated operations including grocers (OK Bazaars), furniture factories and stores (Associated Furniture Company), shoe factories and stores (Shoecorp), and clothing stores (Scotts Stores and Edgars Fashion Group). In 1996, more than 20% of SAB&#x27;s workforce was employed in these companies.

Changes in consumer preferences towards less expensive goods had a negative effect on the premium retail market in the mid-1990s. SAB off-loaded the OK Bazaar grocery chain in 1997 for one rand, after losing nearly R20 million per month. And at the beginning of 1998, the Clothing and Footwear, as well as the furniture divisions were also sold. Later SAB also sold its 21% minority stake in Edgars Fashion Group in 2004.

SAB no longer holds any manufacturing or retail assets.

===International expansion===
The company&#x27;s earliest international venture was in 1910 when it founded Rhodesian Breweries in Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. This subsidiary spearheaded SAB&#x27;s initial international expansion efforts, having established new breweries in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia and Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, in the early 1950s. Further international expansion came in the 1970s and 1980s with the establishment of breweries in Botswana, Angola, and the buying of &quot;Compañía Cervezera de Canarias&quot; of the Canary Islands. Nevertheless, prior to 1990, SAB remained primarily focused on domestic opportunities.

In 1994, a formal Export Department consisting of 3 people (Neal &amp; McLellan et al.) was established at Beer Division Central Office and was tasked with trading beer into Africa. This proved to be a masterstroke in Strategy as laid the foundations for a significant growth catalyst for Brand and accordingly, market share establishment into African and Indian Ocean markets, as well as generated significant foreign currency for the Group to allow for Investment (South African Reserve Bank regulations at the time made raising Foreign Capital difficult). SAB was invited to revitalise the beer industry in Tanzania, a joint venture with that country&#x27;s government in Tanzania Breweries Limited, and to re-enter the beer markets of Zambia, Mozambique and, later, Angola. This followed one of its first foreign investments into the Canary Islands. Expansion continued into Africa in the 1990s and on other continents into Hungary (1993), China (1995), Romania, Poland (1995–96), Slovakia (1997), and Russia (1998), the Czech Republic (1999), India (2000) and Central America in 2001.

The group&#x27;s expansion into Asia started with its 1995 negotiation of joint control of the second-largest brewery in mainland China with China Resources, a privatisation arm of the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Further investments included those in the Harbin Brewery Group and the Fuyang City Snowland Brewery. In 2000 SAB plc entered the Indian market where it has subsequently increased its commitment.

By 2001, turnover from SAB plc&#x27;s international operations accounted for 42% of group turnover. The same year, a pan-African strategic alliance with the Castel group offered the opportunity to invest in promising new African markets and the benefits of scale economies.

Involvement in Central and South America started in 2001 with the acquisition of Honduran and Salvadoran breweries. This was followed four years later by the purchase of a major holding in Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, South America&#x27;s second largest brewer.

One of its largest transactions was with the Miller Brewing Company in the US in 2002, whereupon the listed company changed its name to SABMiller plc.

By the end of March 2009, SABMiller produced global lager volumes of 210 million hectolitres, with total group revenues of US$25,302 million.

On 10 October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller for £69 billion. The arrangement had been approved by shareholders of both companies on 28 September 2016, and the deal closed on 10 October 2016. The acquisition, subsequently referred to as a merger in the news media, ended the corporate use of the name SABMiller. The new company is called Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, (AB InBev) and is trading on the Brussels Stock Exchange as ABI.BR and as BUD on the New York stock exchange. SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and divested itself of its interests in the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors.

After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi Breweries Group Holdings, Ltd. for US$7.8 billion. The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher and Ursus.

SABMiller was one of the world&#x27;s largest Coca-Cola bottlers and had carbonated soft drinks bottling operations in 14 markets. These were subsequently owned by the new Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV entity which is also a PepsiCo bottler. In December 2016, Coca-Cola Co. bought the Coca-Cola operations in Africa and in two Central American countries. The deal requires regulatory approval and should close by the end of 2017.

==Controversy==
In March 2014, the Competition Tribunal found that the South African Breweries (SAB) did not engage in any anti-competitive behaviour following a case of alleged anti-competitive behaviour brought by the Competition Commission which was heard by the Tribunal between 2010 and 2013. The case was the result of an investigation into allegations related to SAB&#x27;s distribution system and pricing activities between 2004 and 2007, with the allegations having been referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2007.

Throughout the trial, the company maintained that none of its practices were in breach of the law and that it had not engaged in any anti-competitive behaviour. It noted that &quot;SAB has structured its business to serve retailers and consumers and strongly believes that all businesses have the right to distribute their products in the manner that best serves their needs…”

The case was in the public domain for several years, having been referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2007 by the Competition Commission after a three-year investigation between 2004 and 2007. The original complaint lodged by Big Daddy&#x27;s head Nico Pitsiladis with the Competition Commission alleged that SAB charged the Big Daddy&#x27;s group as a wholesaler the same price as the company charged to retailers, thereby preventing Big Daddy&#x27;s from earning a fair margin on its sales to retail.

The case that was presented by the Competition Commission before the Competition Tribunal related to SAB&#x27;s distribution system; an alleged practice of minimum resale price maintenance; an allegation of price discrimination and broad, diffuse allegations relating to abuse of dominance. The abuse of dominance allegations were previously separated from the &quot;distribution&quot; case and may proceed separately although the commission has taken no further steps on this part of the case.

SAB applied in 2011 to have the case dismissed, arguing that the case presented to the Tribunal was not the same as the original complaint laid by the Big Daddy&#x27;s group in 2004. This was upheld by the Tribunal in April 2011.

Following the Tribunal&#x27;s dismissal of the case in April 2011, the Competition Commission applied to the Constitutional Court for direct access to the Constitutional Court, bypassing both the Competition Appeal Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December 2011, the Constitutional Court handed down a decision in which it dismissed, with costs, the Competition Commission&#x27;s direct access application.

The Commission subsequently filed an appeal with the Competition Appeal Court, which was heard on 13 September 2012. In November 2012, the Competition Appeal Court announced it had upheld the commission&#x27;s appeal and set aside the Tribunal&#x27;s ruling. This resulted in the resumption of the commission&#x27;s case against SAB, which was heard before the Tribunal in July and August 2013.

<text>Gabriel Knight is a series of point-and-click adventure games released by Sierra On-Line in the 1990s created by Jane Jensen. The titular character is an author and book store owner in New Orleans who is investigating a strange series of murders when he learns he is descended from a long line of &quot;Schattenjäger&quot; (&quot;Shadow Hunters&quot;). After undergoing a spiritual trial, Gabriel becomes the new &quot;Schattenjäger&quot;, called on to stop those who use supernatural methods to threaten others. To signify this, he wears the Ritter Talisman, a protective medallion. Not having supernatural abilities himself, Gabriel mainly opposes his enemies with cunning and insight after investigation and research. In the first game, he is assisted by Grace Nakimura. In the two sequels, the two act as partners against evil, with Grace being a playable character.

The original 1993 game &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; met with success and popularity, due in part to the voice cast including actors Tim Curry, Leah Remini, Virginia Capers, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. The game was followed by two sequel games that each used a different style of game design: &quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery&quot; (1995), an interactive movie featuring werewolves, and &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; (1999), a 3D graphics game involving vampires. The first two games met with enough critical success that &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared Jane Jensen &quot;the interactive Anne Rice&quot;. The third game did not reach the same success and wound up being the final game published by Sierra following the decline of the point-and-click adventure video game industry.

The first two games each had a published novelization written by game creator and writer Jane Jensen. The original game was re-released in 2014 as &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father (20th Anniversary Edition)&quot;. This version had remastered graphics, sound, and new voice recordings. To celebrate its release, Jane Jensen posted a &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; short story online, one set six months after the third game.

==Series==
The &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; characters and games were created by writer Jane Jensen, who also worked on &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot; with veteran game designer Roberta Williams. The music in the series was composed by Robert Holmes, Jensen&#x27;s husband.

All three games in the series focus on the adventures of Gabriel Knight, a financially struggling author and bookstore owner in New Orleans who discovers his true family name is Ritter and he is destined to follow the family legacy of being a &quot;Schattenjäger&quot; (German for &quot;Shadow Hunter&quot;). Grace Nakimura is a major supporting character in &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot;, running the bookstore while doing research for Gabriel. The two are friends who often bicker. In the sequel games, Grace and Gabriel develop a closer relationship and act more as partners when investigating the supernatural. The second game teases their romantic feelings for each other, while the third game has them directly confront their feelings. The two sequel games make Grace a lead character alongside Gabriel and the player alternates between controlling each of them during different parts of the game.

Each game calls on the player to acquire information through investigation of surroundings and interrogation of non-player characters (NPCs). Players must also solve puzzles and complete tasks through the use of items they acquire, information they obtain, devices they activate, or provoking action in NPCs. The game&#x27;s story generally proceeds linearly, with the player unable to continue into the next &quot;day&quot; or &quot;chapter&quot; or &quot;time block&quot; of the narrative until they have solved the required puzzles and obtained the proper information. Solving puzzles and gathering information results in the collection of points.

&quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; and &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; both included short graphic novels that contained back-story, much in the tradition of Infocom&#x27;s &quot;feelies&quot;. The &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot; graphic novel follows the story of Günter Ritter, an ancestor of Gabriel Knight, who has left his ancestral home for the American continent in the 17th century. The &quot;Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; graphic novel acts as a prologue to the game, explaining how Gabriel began the case.

===&quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot;===

The first game in the series is a point and click adventure done in third-person style, with comic book style art used for story cut scenes. While the floppy version of the game only included subtitles, the CD-ROM version featured a cast of voice actors. Tim Curry plays Gabriel Knight, Mark Hamill plays his old friend Detective Franklin Mosely, Leah Remini plays his assistant and friend Grace Nakimura, and Leilani Jones as Malia Gedde. Other characters include Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Wolfgang Ritter, Gabriel&#x27;s great-uncle, Michael Dorn as Dr. John, a proprietor of a voodoo museum, and Mary Kay Bergman as Gerde Hull, the caretaker at Gabriel&#x27;s ancestral home Schloss Ritter in Germany. The narrator is Virginia Capers.

This game introduces Gabriel Knight, a financially struggling horror novelist who owns a bookstore in New Orleans called &quot;St. George&#x27;s Rare Books&quot;. His friend Detective Mosely is investigating series of homicides dubbed &quot;The Voodoo Murders&quot; by the press. Compelled by strange nightmares and thinking the murders may give him good material for a book, Gabriel begins his own investigation, aided by his assistant Grace Nakimura. This leads him to meet mysterious New Orleans socialite Malia Gedde, as well as learn much about the history of voodoo. During the investigation, Gabriel realizes genuine supernatural practices are involved and learns he is related to the Ritter family, making him the latest in a line of &quot;Schattenjägers&quot; (&quot;Shadow Hunters&quot;) who are meant to fight those who use supernatural methods to threaten innocent lives.

The 20th anniversary remake edition featured Jason Victor as Gabriel Knight, Cissy Jones as Grace Nakimura, Ned Clarke as Detective Mosely, and Amy Kelly as the Narrator.

===&quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery&quot;===
The second game (also known as Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within) is in the style of a live-action interactive movie, starring Dean Erickson as Gabriel Knight and Joanne Takahashi as Grace Nakimura. Grace is now a playable character for portions of the game. The character Gerde Hull is back as an NPC, portrayed by Andrea Martin.

A year after the events of &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot; and after undergoing the spiritual trial necessary to become a &quot;Schattenjäger&quot;, Gabriel has moved to his ancestral home in the small village of Rittersberg in Bavaria, Germany to write his new novel and connect with his family lineage. His new book &quot;The Voodoo Murders&quot;, a fiction murder mystery based on the events of the first game, is now a best-seller. The people of Rittersberg, the seat of the &quot;Schattenjägers&quot;, ask for Gabriel&#x27;s help when there is talk of a werewolf attack in Munich. Gabriel investigates and Grace comes to Germany to help him, determined to fight evil alongside the &quot;Schattenjäger&quot; and now experiencing visions and dreams of her own. Gabriel develops an unusual friendship with Baron Friedrich Von Glower, who leads an exclusive hunting club in Munich and believes Knight is a kindred spirit.

===&quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot;===
This game uses 3D rendered graphics and features the return of Tim Curry to the role of Gabriel Knight. Grace is once again a playable character, now voiced by Charity James. Detective Franklin Mosely returns to Gabriel&#x27;s life, now voiced by David Thomas.

Years after the events of the second game, Gabriel has published another successful book called &quot;The Brutal Beast&quot;, based on his experiences in the previous game. He now considers himself a full-time &quot;Schattenjäger&quot; and Grace is his full partner, having created a computerized &quot;Schattenjäger&quot; archive called SYDNEY. The two are asked by the exiled Prince James of Albany to protect his newborn son from a centuries-old family threat that may involve vampires. That same night, the boy Charlie is kidnapped and Gabriel follows the kidnappers to the mysterious French village of Rennes-le-Château. Gabriel&#x27;s arrival coincides with that of a visiting tour group supposedly hunting for a legendary local treasure that may be linked to the Roman Catholic Church, the Knights Templar, or the Holy Grail. Gabriel and Grace investigate the case alongside Mosely, who arrived with the tour group. After finding and rescuing the child, Gabriel discovers the origin of the first &quot;Schattenjäger&quot;. At the end of the game, Grace leaves Gabriel&#x27;s side to find her own path.

===&quot;Temptation: A Gabriel Knight Interlude&quot;===
To celebrate the release of &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers - 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, Jane Jensen released a short prose story online. The story &quot;Temptation: A Gabriel Knight Interlude&quot; is set six months following the events of the third game. The story was later adapted into a comic book.

The short story depicts Gabriel pursuing a cloaked figure in the woods said to be a seeleesser, &quot;an eater of souls&quot;. During the case, Gabriel reflects on recent events and Grace&#x27;s departure, as well as the fact that he has fulfilled three major &quot;quests&quot; already and is now 36-years-old, bringing him to wonder if he has reached his peak already. During the adventure, he has a vision of Von Glower from &quot;The Beast Within&quot; and hears the man voice his own doubts and selfish desires, saying Gabriel should return to his life where he had no responsibility and didn&#x27;t need to endanger himself hunting evil. In the end, Gabriel dismisses the vision and continues his investigations.

===Possible fourth game===
After the release of &quot;Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot;, Jane Jensen stated she had started planning a possible story and setting for a fourth game. In &quot;Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot;, the player can use the SIDNEY computer interface to search for &quot;gk4&quot; and see an entry on ghosts as a result. Jane Jensen said ghosts would have been the antagonists for a fourth entry to the series. However, no &quot;Gabriel Knight 4&quot; game followed and in August 2006, it was confirmed that Jane Jensen&#x27;s next adventure game project would be the revival of &quot;Gray Matter&quot;.

The rights to Gabriel Knight are currently held by Activision, which acquired them after merging with former rights holder Vivendi Universal in 2008. Jane Jensen has pitched new &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; games to both Vivendi and Activision. In April 2012, Jensen launched Pinkerton Road Studio and said in interviews that she hopes producing a new game with Pinkerton Road is a step in the right direction for getting the chance to make new &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; games in the future. A remake of &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; for Windows, OS X, iOS and Android was released on October 15, 2014.

In 2022, Jensen noted that she has previously envisaged a potential fourth game being about witches and set in Scotland. She stated her willingness to proceed with a book version as a method to make any potential subsequent game production more feasible, but admitted that the complex nature of rights and legal contracts with Activision continues to render such a project unlikely.

==Characters==
* Gabriel Knight is the central protagonist of the series, the orphaned son of Philip Knight and Margaret Templeton Knight, meant to be about 30 year old when the narrative starts (although his age is not consistent in the games). Gabriel is the proprietor of St. George&#x27;s Rare Books in his hometown of New Orleans and a struggling horror fiction author. Charismatic, sardonic, and intuitive, he prefers to avoid responsibility, often distracted by interesting books and casual affairs with women. His two main friends are his assistant Grace Nakimura and his childhood friend Franklin Mosely, a police detective. Early in the first game, he realizes there is more to his family than he knows. Gabriel&#x27;s nightmares and a desire to research a new book lead him to investigate recent &quot;voodoo murders&quot;. During his investigation, he discovers he descends from the Ritter family and is the latest in a line of &quot;Schattenjägers&quot; (&quot;Shadow Hunters&quot;). Visiting his family castle &quot;Schloss Ritter&quot; in Rittersberg, Germany, he undergoes a spiritual trial to become a new &quot;Schattenjäger&quot;. He later inherits the Ritter Talisman. &quot;GK2&quot; features a somewhat more somber Gabriel now living in his family castle over a year later and experiencing financial success since his new novel &quot;The Voodoo Murders&quot; (based on his experiences in the first game and starring fictional detective Blake Backlash) is a best-seller. By &quot;GK3&quot;, Gabriel has published another successful novel entitled &quot;The Brutal Beast&quot;, based on the events of the second game. Gabriel is a more mature and experienced character, now more focused on his duties as a &quot;Schattenjäger&quot;, with Grace as a full partner in his investigations. Despite his feelings, he still resists romantic commitment with Grace.
* Grace Nakimura is first introduced in &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; in 1993 as a non-player character, before becoming a player character in both sequel games. Introduced as a 26-year-old assistant, Grace is a researcher, aid, and moral compass for Gabriel in the first game. She becomes a full investigative partner in the two sequel games and is more strongly in the role of romantic interest. At the end of the third game, she decides to pursue her own path rather than remain Gabriel&#x27;s helper. Grace has been included in multiple lists of top sidekicks and female characters in video games. &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that Grace was &quot;more likable&quot; than Knight and more &quot;intelligent and resourceful&quot;. In 2007, Tom&#x27;s Games also noted that unlike traditional female characters in video games, Grace is designed with conservative dress, without &quot;sexy outfits [and] out-sized proportions&quot;. According to USgamer&#x27;s Pete Davison in 2013, &quot;Grace Nakimura remains one of the best, most realistic female characters in game history&quot;.
* Gerde Hull (voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the first game, and played by Andrea Martin in the second) is the caretaker of Gabriel&#x27;s ancestral home, &quot;Schloss Ritter&quot; in Ritterberg, Germany. When Gabriel first meets Gerde in &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot;, she is an anxious and enthusiastically optimistic young woman. She clearly has deep love and respect for Gabriel&#x27;s great-uncle Wolfgang Ritter, grieving the man&#x27;s death still during the events of &quot;The Beast Within&quot;. Gerde acts as a valuable research assistant. Grace considers her a possible rival as Gabriel&#x27;s investigative partner and love interest but after a talk with Gerde the two become friends. Gerde does not appear in the third game but is mentioned.

==Novelizations==
The stories of &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot; and &quot;The Beast Within&quot; were adapted into novels by Jane Jensen. The first is a straightforward adaptation of the events of the game, an approach which Jane Jensen decided, in retrospect, was not the most successful way of introducing Gabriel Knight to a literary audience. For the second novel she &quot;threw the whole idea of the game away and started again from scratch&quot;.

Both books are out of print as of 2010. As part of her 2012 Kickstarter campaign to fund a new adventure game, Jensen offered both &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; novels as ebooks to backers who pledge $50 or more.

==Compilation==
In 1998, Sierra released the title Gabriel Knight Mysteries: Limited Edition, which contains: 
* an 8-disc PC CD box of first two &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; games and electronic manuals.
* a 419-page novelization of &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; (written by Jane Jensen and published by Roc in 1997).
* a full soundtrack of &quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery&quot;.
* bundled with the original 1993 editions, a 33-page full-color graphic novel of an event that takes place almost 200 years before the opening of &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; (written by Jane Jensen, art direction by Nathan Gams and illustrated by Terese Nielsen).
* a 20-page full-color graphic novel of an event that takes place days before the opening of the then-upcoming &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; (written by Jane Jensen and illustrated by Ron Spears).

<text>Patricia Calton (; 19 September 1948 – 29 May 2005) was a British Liberal Democrat politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cheadle in Greater Manchester.

She was first elected at the 2001 general election, with a 33-vote majority over the sitting Conservative MP Stephen Day. She held her seat in the 2005 general election with a majority of 4,020 votes over Stephen Day, despite being too ill with cancer to campaign personally. She died less than four weeks later, although she was sworn in as an MP five days before her death. She also stood at the 1992 general election and the 1997 general election. She had previously been a deputy leader of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. She is, to date, the only Liberal Democrat MP to have died in office since the party&#x27;s foundation in 1988.

==Biography==
Calton was born into a Royal Air Force family and as a result moved around frequently as a child. She began her schooling in Egypt while her father was posted there but most of her school days were spent at Wymondham College in Norfolk.

After her degree in biochemistry at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), she took a Postgraduate Certificate in Education at the University of Manchester.

Either side of a career break while bringing up her family, she taught Chemistry in comprehensive schools in Greater Manchester and Cheshire. In June 2001 she left teaching for Parliament, her last school being Poynton High School, where she was head of Chemistry and head of Legh House.

In Parliament, she was a Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on Northern Ireland and on health, and was also chair of the all-party group on breast cancer.

She was married to her husband Clive in 1969. They had three children; Libby, Andrew and Catherine and one grandchild named Bethany. The family lived in Bramhall for most of their married life and all the children were educated at local schools — Pownall Green Primary and Bramhall High School — and then at Stockport&#x27;s sixth form colleges.

Calton was first diagnosed with breast cancer following the 1997 election campaign. She recovered after she had undergone a double mastectomy the same year. She ran the London Marathon four times to raise money for Macmillan Nurses. In February 2005 the cancer recurred, this time in the spine. She died in Stockport on 29 May 2005.
A few days before her death, she entered the House of Commons in a wheelchair to affirm her allegiance. Speaker Michael Martin broke with tradition, leaving the Speaker&#x27;s Chair to shake Calton&#x27;s hand, said &quot;welcome home Patsy,&quot; and kissed her cheek.

After her death, Breakthrough Breast Cancer established the Breakthrough Patsy Calton Award in her honour to recognise exceptional achievement by parliamentarians in campaigning for improvements in breast cancer research, services and/or the patient experience.

<text>Sharm El Sheikh (, , literally &quot;bay of the Sheikh&quot;), alternatively rendered Sharm el-Sheikh, Sharm el Sheikh, or Sharm El-Sheikh, is an Egyptian city on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, in South Sinai Governorate, on the coastal strip along the Red Sea. Its population is approximately 13,000 . Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt&#x27;s South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of Dahab and Nuweiba as well as the mountainous interior, St. Catherine and Mount Sinai. It was historically a fishing town and military base, and was developed into a commercial and tourist-centric city in 1968 by Israel. Today, the city and holiday resort is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences and diplomatic meetings.

==Name==

The English name of Sharm El Sheikh is a borrowing of the Egyptian Arabic &quot;شرم الشيخ&quot;, &quot;šarm aš-šayḵ&quot; and, as such, does not have a fixed romanisation. There are documented uses of alternate spellings such as Sharm el Sheikh and Sharm el-Sheikh, sometimes within the same news article.

Sharm El Sheikh is sometimes referred to as the &quot;City of Peace&quot; (Egyptian Arabic: &quot;Madinet el-Salam&quot;), referring to the large number of International Peace Conferences that have been held there.

Amongst Egyptians and also many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to &quot;Sharm&quot; (), which is its common name in Egyptian Arabic.

==Geography and history==
Sharm El Sheikh is on a promontory overlooking the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy. It was conquered by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and returned to Egypt in 1957. A United Nations peacekeeping force was stationed there until 1967 when it was ordered to leave by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a fact that precipitated the Six-Day War during which it was reoccupied by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control from 1967 until the Sinai Peninsula was returned back to Egypt in 1982, after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 that was signed in Washington, D.C. During that time, an Israeli settlement named Ofira was built in the area. In 1968, Israel opened an air force base there which functions today as the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport. Unlike Sinai&#x27;s other well-known settlement, Yamit, Ofira was not demolished after Israel ceded control of Sinai to Egypt following the Camp David Accords, but was returned intact and is today a thriving tourist town and home to local Egyptian residents.
Egypt&#x27;s then-president Hosni Mubarak designated Sharm El Sheikh as &quot;The City of Peace&quot; in 1982 and the Egyptian government began a policy of encouraging further development of the city. Egyptian businessmen and investors, along with global investors contributed to building several mega projects, including mosques and churches. The city is now an international tourist destination, and environmental zoning laws limit the height of buildings to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings.

A hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the Gulf of Aqaba, whereby the area&#x27;s components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: Taba, Nuweiba, Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, Naama Bay, Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.

Sharm El Sheikh city, with Naama Bay, Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and form a metropolitan area.

The site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.

In 2005, the resort was hit by the Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks, which were carried out by an extremist Islamist organisation targeting Egypt&#x27;s tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country&#x27;s history.
The city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to establish Palestinian self-rule over the Gaza Strip. A second summit was held at Sharm on 17 October 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but it failed to end the violence. A summit was held in the city on 3 August 2005 on developments in the Arab world, such as the situation in the Arab–Israeli conflict. Again in 2007, an important ministerial meeting took place in Sharm, where dignitaries discussed Iraqi reconstruction. The World Economic Forum on the Middle East was hosted by Sharm El Sheikh in 2006 and 2008.

Amidst the 2011 Egyptian protests, then-president Mubarak reportedly went to Sharm El Sheikh and resigned there on 11 February 2011.

In November 2022, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) was held in Sharm El Sheikh. This conference led to the first loss and damage fund being created.

==Climate==
The city experiences a subtropical arid climate, classified by the Köppen–Geiger system as hot desert (BWh). Temperatures are just short of a tropical climate. Typical temperatures range from in January and in August. The temperature of the Red Sea in this region ranges from over the course of the year.

Marsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm El Sheikh have the warmest winter night temperatures of cities and resorts in Egypt.

The highest recorded temperature was on 3 June 2013, and the lowest recorded temperature was on 23 February 2000.


==Economy and tourism==


Sharm El Sheikh&#x27;s major industry is foreign and domestic tourism, owing to its landscape, year-round dry climate with long hot summers and warm winters and its long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year and have become popular for various watersports, particularly recreational scuba diving and snorkeling. There is scope for scientific tourism due to the diversity of marine life: 250 different coral reefs and 1000 species of fish.

These natural resources, together with its proximity to tourist markets in Europe, have stimulated rapid growth in tourism in the region. The number of resorts has increased from three in 1982 to ninety-one in 2000. Guest nights also increased in that period from sixteen thousand to 5.1 million. International hotel companies that currently operate in the city include Accor (Mövenpick, Novotel, Rixos), Deutsche Hospitality (Steigenberger), Four Seasons, Hilton (DoubleTree), Marriott (Renaissance, Sheraton), and Rotana, with categories of three to five stars. In 2007, the first aqua park hotel resort opened in the area. The four-star Aqua Blu Sharm Resort was built on the Ras Om El Seid, with an area of .

Sharm is also home to a congress center, located along Peace Road, where international political and economic meetings have been held, including peace conferences, ministerial meetings, world bank meetings, and Arab League meetings. The Maritim Sharm El Sheikh International Congress Centre can host events and congresses for up to 4,700 participants.

There is nightlife in Sharm El Sheikh. The colorful handicraft stands of the local Bedouin culture are a popular attraction. Ras Muhammad National Park, at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, has been designated a national park, protecting the area&#x27;s wildlife, natural landscape, shoreline and coral reef. There are a number of international hotels and restaurants in the centre of Sharm, in the area known as Naama Bay, with golf courses and other leisure facilities further up the coast.

The Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area is a area of mangroves, coral reefs, fertile dunes, birds and wildlife.

As of 2012, nationals from the EU and the US do not require a visa for travel to Sharm El Sheikh if the visit is for fourteen days or less, although those travelling outside the Sinai area may still require a visa, which is purchasable for a small fee on arrival. Visitors are often ushered into a queue to buy a visa after entering the airport upon landing.

===Flight incidents===
On 23 August 2015, Thomson Airways Flight 476, approaching Sharm El Sheikh at the end of a flight from London Stansted Airport with 189 passengers aboard, took evasive action to avoid a missile traveling toward it. the missile missed the airliner by about , and the plane landed safely. A UK investigation concluded that the missile was an Egyptian armed forces missile that had strayed from a military exercise, although the Egyptian government said the flight was never at risk.

On 31 October 2015, while flying from Sharm El Sheikh to Saint Petersburg, Metrojet Flight 9268 was destroyed by a bomb above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, killing all 224 people on board, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for this incident. This caused the repatriation of British and Russian tourists from 5 November 2015. Following these events, many countries ordered all flights to Sharm El Sheikh be suspended. These suspensions were gradually lifted as the security situation improved, with the UK government ending its ban on direct flights on 22 October 2019. The process of lifting flight suspensions was completed on 9 August 2021, when the first direct flight from Russia since November 2015 (operated by Rossiya Airlines) landed at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport.

==Transport==

Lampposts on El Salaam Street use solar power.
Taxis and buses are numbered for safety.

Sharm&#x27;s marina has been redeveloped for private yachts and sailing boats, with a passenger terminal for cruise ships.

The city is served by Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, the third largest airport in Egypt.

Sharm has frequent coach services to Cairo leaving from the Delta Sharm bus station.
==Scuba diving and water sports==
Sharm El Sheikh has become a popular location for scuba diving as a result of its underwater scenery and warm waters. Other beach activities include snorkeling, windsurfing, kite-surfing, para-sailing, boating, and canoeing.

Ras Muhammad National Park is located at the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula where the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez meet, producing strong currents and providing a habitat for diverse marine life. Two reefs popular with divers are Shark Reef, a vertical wall descending to over , and Yolanda Reef, the site of the wreck of the Yolanda.

The Straits of Tiran are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and in a major shipping lane. There are four reefs there, each named after one of the British cartographers who first mapped them: Gordan, Thomas, Woodhouse and Jackson. In summer months, hammerhead sharks swim in schools near the reefs.

The Sharm El Sheikh Hyperbaric Medical Center was founded in 1993 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism with a grant from USAID, to assist with diving-related medical conditions.

===Shark attacks===

On 1 December 2010, four tourists − three Russians and a Ukrainian − were attacked and injured by an oceanic whitetip shark or sharks in three separate incidents off Sharm El Sheikh. One victim lost a leg, and another an arm. The Egyptian authorities claimed that the shark responsible for the attacks had been captured alive, but the identification was disputed by the diving industry, based on eyewitness and photographic evidence. Four days later, on 5 December, an elderly German woman was attacked and killed by a shark while snorkeling at the resort.

<text>The Canadian Museum of Nature (; CMN) is a national natural history museum based in Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region. The museum&#x27;s exhibitions and public programs are housed in the Victoria Memorial Museum Building, a in Ottawa, Ontario. The museum&#x27;s administrative offices and scientific centres are housed at a separate location, the Natural Heritage Campus, in Gatineau, Quebec.

The museum originated from a museum established by the Geological Survey of Canada in 1856. Initially based in Montreal, the museum relocated to downtown Ottawa in 1881. In 1911, the museum relocated to the Victoria Memorial Museum Building. Initially, a natural history museum, the institution later expanded to include an anthropology and human history department; with the institution renamed the National Museum of Canada in 1927. The departments of the national museum were later split into separate national institutions, with the natural history department forming the National Museum of Natural Sciences in 1968. The museum adopted its current name in 1990 after it was made its own autonomous crown corporation. From 2004 to 2010, the museum renovated and expanded the Victoria Memorial Museum Building.

The museum&#x27;s collection contains over 14.6 million specimens of the natural world, several of which are displayed in its permanent exhibitions. The museum also hosts and organizes several travelling exhibitions and supports and conducts several research programs relating to natural history.

==History==
===Early museum (1856–1968)===
The Canadian Museum of Nature originates from the collecting efforts of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), an organization established in 1842 in Montreal. In 1856 the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada passed an act that enabled the GSC to establish a museum to exhibit items found from its geological and archaeological field trips; with the museum initially established in Montreal. In 1877, the museum mandate was formally expanded to include the study of modern fauna and flora, in addition to human history, languages, and traditions.

In 1881, the museum relocated from Montreal to downtown Ottawa; although space in the new facility soon proved to be inadequate, with the Royal Society of Canada petitioning the federal government to build a new building for the museum by 1896. Preliminary plans for a new building were drawn up by 1899, although work on the building did not begin until 1906. In the following year, management of the museum was assumed by the Department of Mines, with the mandate formally expanded to include anthropological studies. The new museum building, the Victoria Memorial building, was also completed in 1910, although it was not opened to the public until 1912. In 1927, the museum division of the Department of Mines was renamed the &quot;National Museum of Canada&quot;; with the museum formally split from the GSC.

Management of the National Museum was transferred from the Department of Mines to the Department of Resources and Development in 1950. In 1956, the museum was split into two branches, one focused on natural history and another on anthropology. The mandate of the museum was later expanded when the National Museum of Canada assumed management of the Canadian War Museum in 1958. A history division was established within the museum&#x27;s anthropology branch in 1964.

===Natural History Museum (1968–present)===
In 1968, the branches of the National Museum of Canada were split into separate museums. The Canadian Museum of Nature originated from the natural history branch of the museum, initially incorporated as the &quot;National Museum of Natural Sciences&quot;. The anthropological and human history branch of the former National Museum of Canada became the National Museum of Man (later renamed the Canadian Museum of Civilization in 1988, and the Canadian Museum of History in 2013), while the science and technology branch became the National Museum of Science and Technology (later renamed the Canada Science and Technology Museum). In the same year, the National Museums of Canada Corporation (NMC) was formed to serve as an umbrella organization for the national museums, as well as provide support and administrative units for the museums. The National Museum of Natural Sciences formed a part of the NMC until the organization was dissolved in 1988.

In 1990, the government of Canada passed the &quot;Museums Act&quot;, which led to the National Museum of Natural Sciences and several national museums being incorporated as autonomous crown corporations. The same act also renamed the National Museum of Natural Sciences into the Canadian Museum of Nature. By 1990, the museum was the only remaining occupant of the Victoria Memorial building. In 1997, the museum opened a new research and collections facility in Gatineau, Quebec, consolidating its research facilities and collections holdings in one building.

Between 2004 and 2010, the federal government spent approximately C$216 million dollars on expanding and renovating the Canadian Museum of Nature. Construction for the rehabilitation project was done in phases, with large portions of the existing structure removed and demolished for renovations. On 22 May 2010, International Day for Biological Diversity, the museum building was reopened to the public. The building&#x27;s glass tower, or the &quot;Queens&#x27; Lantern&quot;, was dedicated in honour of Queens Victoria and Elizabeth II, with the latter attending the tower&#x27;s dedication ceremony in June 2010.

==Facilities==
The Canadian Museum of Nature operates two facilities. The Victoria Memorial Museum Building in Ottawa houses the museum&#x27;s exhibitions and public programs, while its administrative, research and collections facility is situated at the Natural Heritage Centre in Gatineau.

===Victoria Memorial Museum Building===

The Victoria Memorial Museum Building in Ottawa houses the museum&#x27;s exhibitions and galleries and other public programs operated by the museum. The building is located on a property is located in Centretown, a neighbourhood of Ottawa. Situated approximately south of Centre Block on Parliament Hill, the building was initially designed to mirror the Canadian Parliament Buildings as a part of a larger envisioned planned capital. The property is surrounded by several roadways including O&#x27;Connor Street to the west, and Metcalfe Street to the east. Metcalfe Street&#x27;s southern and northern portions also terminate north and south of the building as it detours to the east of the property.

The building is the first purpose-built museum building erected in Canada. The federal government authorized the construction of the building in 1901, in honour of Queen Victoria; with construction for the building taking place between 1905 and 1911. After its completion, the building housed the national museums, in addition to the National Gallery of Canada from 1911 to 1959. The building&#x27;s auditorium also housed the Ottawa Little Theatre until 1916. The theatre company was forced to vacate the space after a fire ravaged Centre Block, forcing the temporary relocation of the parliament to the building until 1920. The Canadian Museum of Nature became the building&#x27;s sole occupant after the Canadian Museum of Civilization relocated to another facility in 1988. On 23 February 1990, the building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, given the building&#x27;s importance to the development of museology in Canada, as well as for its architecture.

====Design====

The Tudor-Gothic Revival-style building was designed by David Ewart, the Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works. Tudor-Gothic detailing may be found throughout the building; including its original entrance that consists of a triple arch with neo-gothic tracery, pointed arch windows, decorative buttresses, and crenellations and corner turret. Many of the carvings found on the building depict Canadian flora and fauna. In addition to its Tudor-Gothic detailing, the design and orientation of the building also draw upon Beaux-Arts architectural principles.

The interior is also embellished with carved wood and bronze balustrades, mosaic floors, marble and plaster detailing and decorative works, and stained glass windows. The interior spaces are centred around a formal hall from which all the museum&#x27;s other spaces are accessible.

The building initially included a central tower at its entrance. However, the original tower caused the building to &quot;sink&quot; as the original design did not account for the Leda clay the structure was built on, resulting in the original tower&#x27;s removal several years after the building opened. A glass and steel tower erected in the place of the former central tower was built between 2004 and 2010. The new central tower, named the &quot;Queens&#x27; Lantern&quot; was formally opened in May 2010. The glass tower houses a butterfly staircase that was installed to improve visitor circulation in the museum. 

The construction of the Queens&#x27; Lantern formed a part of a larger rehabilitation project undertaken by the museum between 2004 and 2010, including a partially below-grade expansion to the south of the building, which included laboratories, the shipping and receiving area, workshops, and a green roof; the latter feature used as an outdoor public gathering place. The area surrounding the building&#x27;s south-side expansion includes green spaces, a greenhouse, and a live animal display area. Other renovations included extensive redesigns to the exhibitions, seismic and building code upgrades, mechanical and electrical system upgrades, asbestos removal, and repairing and restoring the masonry on the building. Designs for the 2004-2010 renovations, including the Queens&#x27; Lantern, was a joint effort between Barry Padolsky Associates Inc., KPMB Architects, and Gagnon Joint Venture Architects; with PCL Construction contracted to renovate and build the expansion.

Materials used to erect the building include Tyndall stone, steel frames, reinforced concrete, stone exterior cladding, and sandstone. Most of the sandstone used in the building was quarried from Nepean, Ontario, Wallace, Nova Scotia, and several communities in Quebec. Granite used in the building was quarried from Stanstead, Quebec.

===Natural Heritage Campus===
The Natural Heritage Campus houses the museum&#x27;s administrative offices, scientific facilities, and collection storage. Situated in Gatineau, Quebec, the campus was opened by the museum in 1997. The building itself is , and offers workspaces, in addition to laboratory spaces.

The building includes three environmentally controlled &quot;pods,&quot; housing 42 individual collection rooms and nine documentation rooms. More than 3,000 cabinets are used in the facility&#x27;s storage spaces to house the museum&#x27;s specimens. To help preserve the specimens, none of the storage facilities share a wall with the exterior of the building; with a specially sealed corridor surrounding its storage spaces.

==Exhibitions==
The museum has seven permanent exhibitions at its Victoria Memorial Museum Building. In addition to its permanent exhibitions, the museum also hosts and organizes several travelling exhibitions. 

The permanent exhibitions at the museum include the Bird Gallery; with over 500 specimens mounted throughout the gallery, representing over 450 species. Several diorama backgrounds featured in the Bird Gallery were painted by James Perry Wilson. The Mammal Gallery is a gallery centred on mammals found in Canada, and also includes several dioramas painted by Clarence Tillenius during the mid-20th century. The Earth Gallery is a permanent exhibition focused on minerals, rocks, and other geological forces. A goodwill Lunar sample gifted to Canada by the United States is on display in the Earth Gallery. The Fossil Gallery is another permanent exhibition that contains fossils from dinosaurs, mammals, and marine animals from approximately 35 to 85 million years ago; including over 30 nearly complete sets of dinosaur skeletons dating between 65 and 85 million years old. A fairly complete specimen of an &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; in the museum&#x27;s Fossil Gallery was the first specimen to be mounted in a Canadian museum; having been acquired by the museum in 1912 and on display since 1913. The other permanent exhibitions include Nature Live, a gallery that houses live arachnids, insects and other invertebrates; and the Water Gallery, which focuses on marine animals and hydrology.

The newest permanent exhibition to be introduced at the museum is the Canada Goose Arctic Experience, with over 200 specimens and artifacts from the Canadian Arctic on display in the exhibition. The Arctic Experience gallery was opened in June 2017, coinciding with the 150th anniversary celebrations for Canada. The Arctic Experience gallery encompasses , and is divided into four themed areas that cover climate, ecosystems, geography, and sustainability; in addition to a &quot;Beyond Ice&quot; installation. The &quot;Beyond Ice&quot; installation provides visitors a sensory experience of the Arctic region, and was designed alongside the National Film Board of Canada. Although many of the items on display in the Arctic Experience gallery form a part of the museum&#x27;s collection, the seal-skin kayak, and the items originating from John Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition were loaned to the museum by the Government of Nunavut. Canada Goose Inc. is the gallery&#x27;s title sponsor.

==Collections==

Collecting efforts by the Canadian Museum of Nature forms a part of the museum&#x27;s core mandate, with the collection intended to be used to facilitate &quot;interest in, knowledge of and appreciation and respect for the natural world.&quot; The museum&#x27;s collection includes algae, amphibians, birds, bryophytes, fishes, gemstones, invertebrate animals, lichens, mammals, minerals, mosses, palaeobotany material, reptiles, rocks, vascular plants, and vertebrate fossils. In addition these specimens, the museum&#x27;s collection also includes a collection of art and film pertaining to natural history, audio recording of animal behaviours, and animal models; the latter two typically employed in the museum&#x27;s exhibitions. As of February 2017 the museum&#x27;s collection includes over 14.6 million specimens, forming the largest collection of biological specimens in Canada. Although a number of these items are on display in its exhibitions, many of these specimens are held at an off-site storage facility, the Natural Heritage Campus in Gatineau, Quebec. The off-site facility holds over 3.1 million accessioned lots representing more than 10.6 million specimens. As of 2014, approximately 22 per cent of the accessioned lots have been digitized and may be viewed through an online database. Since 2001, there were approximately 43,000 specimens added to the museum&#x27;s collections annually; acquired primarily through fieldwork by staff, research associates and other collaborators.

The first items from the museum&#x27;s collection originated from the collecting efforts of John Macoun, who was hired as the museum&#x27;s first biologist by the Geological Survey of Canada in 1882. Other early researchers who helped build up the institution&#x27;s collections includes Erling Porsild, Charles Mortram Sternberg, and Percy A. Taverner. In addition to museum staff, the museum&#x27;s collection also includes specimens collected from other naturalists including Catharine Parr Traill. The museum&#x27;s collection includes over 25 scrapbooks from Traill from 1866 to 1899, forming the most extensive collection of plant pressings by Traill. The Traill collection forms a part of the National Herbarium of Canada, the museum&#x27;s botany collection.

The museum&#x27;s herpetology collection includes over 133,000 specimens and forms the world&#x27;s largest collection of herpetological specimens that originate from Canada. The museum also holds the largest collection of Arctic plant specimens from Canada; with over 100,000 Arctic plant specimens forming part of the National Herbarium of Canada collection.

The museum&#x27;s collection also includes the skull of an &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, the first dinosaur skull found in Canada, discovered by Joseph Tyrrell. Other specimens from its fossil collection include the holotypes for the &quot;Daspletosaurus torosus&quot; and the &quot;Vagaceratops&quot;. The former skeletal set was initially mistaken for a &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; although research conducted by the museum during the 1960s determined that the fossils were a new species of dinosaur. The holotype for the &quot;Vagaceratops&quot; was similarly mistaken for a different species when its fossils were first delivered to the museum in 1958; with museum researchers later discovering the fossil was a new species after removing it from the plaster field during the 1990s. In 2015, the museum received over 60 specimens of the &quot;Tiktaalik roseae&quot;. The species was discovered by American paleontologists Edward Daeschler, Farish Jenkins, and Neil Shubin on Ellesmere Island, who studied the fossils in the United States before they were sent to the Canadian Museum of Nature.

==Research==
Supporting and conducting research into natural history forms a part of the museum&#x27;s core mandate according to the &quot;Museum Act&quot;. The museum&#x27;s Research Services are split into two disciplines, life sciences and earth sciences. The museum operates two cross-disciplinary centres, the Beaty Centre for Species Discovery and the Centre for Arctic Knowledge and Exploration. Museum researchers have been conducting research on Arctic flora since the 1980s, with a particular emphasis on alkali grass. Other major research programs the museum took part in include several excavations of the Foremost Formation for dinosaur remains, and the China-Canada Dinosaur Project between 1986 and 1991.

Between 1972 and 1995, the institution published its own scientific journal, &quot;Syllogeus&quot;.

==Library and archives==
The museum also operates a library and archive at the Natural Heritage Centre. The library contains over 35,000 books, 2,000 periodic titles, museum publications, and microfilms relating to natural history. The museum&#x27;s archives contain three collections: archival records relating to the museum; a photograph collection of more than 275,000 slides, photos, negatives, and plates; and an art collection of 1,800 works primarily focused on nature.
