<text>Edith Wilson ( Bolling, formerly Galt; October 15, 1872 – December 28, 1961) was the first lady of the United States from 1915 to 1921 and the second wife of President Woodrow Wilson. She married the widower Wilson in December 1915, during his first term as president. Edith Wilson played an influential role in President Wilson&#x27;s administration following the severe stroke he suffered in October 1919. For the remainder of her husband&#x27;s presidency, she managed the office of the president, a role she later described as a &quot;stewardship&quot;, and determined which communications and matters of state were important enough to bring to the attention of the bedridden president.

==Early life and education==
Edith Bolling was born October 15, 1872, in Wytheville, Virginia, to circuit court judge William Holcombe Bolling and his wife Sarah &quot;Sallie&quot; Spears (née White). Her birthplace, the Bolling Home, is now a museum located in Wytheville&#x27;s Historic District.

Bolling was a descendant of the first settlers to arrive at the Virginia Colony. Through her father, she was also a descendant of Mataoka, better known as Pocahontas. Her father was descended from Pocahontas&#x27;s granddaughter Jane Rolfe, who married Robert Bolling, a wealthy slave-owning planter and merchant. Additionally, she was related, either by blood or through marriage, to Thomas Jefferson, Martha Washington, Letitia Tyler, and the Harrison family.

Edith was the seventh of eleven children, two of whom died in infancy. The Bollings were some of the oldest members of Virginia&#x27;s slave-owning, planter elite prior to the American Civil War. After the war ended and slavery abolished, Edith&#x27;s father turned to the practice of law to support his family. Unable to pay taxes on his extensive properties, and forced to give up the family&#x27;s plantation seat, William Holcombe Bolling moved to Wytheville, where most of his children were born.

The Bolling household was a large one, and Edith grew up within the confines of a sprawling, extended family. In addition to eight surviving siblings, Edith&#x27;s grandmothers, aunts and cousins also lived in the Bolling household. Many of the women in Edith&#x27;s family lost husbands during the war. The Bollings had been staunch supporters of the Confederate States of America, were proud of their Southern planter heritage, and in early childhood, taught Edith in the postCivil War South&#x27;s narrative of the Lost Cause. As was often the case among the planter elite, the Bollings justified slave ownership, saying that the slaves that they owned had been content with their lives as slaves and had little desire for freedom.

==Education==

Edith had little formal education. While her sisters were enrolled in local schools, Edith was taught how to read and write at home. Her paternal grandmother, Anne Wiggington Bolling, played a large role in her education. Crippled by a spinal cord injury, Grandmother Bolling was confined to bed. Edith had the responsibility to wash her clothing, turn her in bed at night, and look after her 26 canaries.

In turn, Grandmother Bolling oversaw Edith&#x27;s education, teaching her reading, writing, basic math skills, speaking a hybrid language of French and English, and making dresses. She also instilled in Edith a tendency to make quick judgments and hold strong opinions, personality traits Edith would exhibit her entire life. William Bolling read classic English literature aloud to his family at night, hired a tutor to teach Edith, and sometimes took her on his travels. The Bolling family attended church regularly, and Edith became a lifelong, practicing Episcopalian.

When Edith was 15, her father enrolled her at Martha Washington College (a precursor of Emory and Henry College), a finishing school for girls in Abingdon, Virginia. William Holcombe Bolling chose it for its excellent music program. Edith proved to be an undisciplined, ill-prepared student. She was miserable there, complaining of the school&#x27;s austerity: the food was poorly prepared, the rooms too cold, and the daily curriculum excessively rigorous, intimidating, and too strictly regimented. Edith left after only one semester. Two years later, Edith&#x27;s father enrolled her in Powell&#x27;s School for Girls in Richmond, Virginia. Years later, Edith noted that her time at Powell&#x27;s was the happiest time of her life. Unfortunately for Edith, the school closed at the end of the year after the headmaster suffered an accident that cost him his leg. Concerned about the cost of Edith&#x27;s education, William Bolling refused to pay for any additional schooling, choosing instead to focus on educating her three brothers.

==First marriage==
While visiting her married sister in Washington, D.C., Edith met Norman Galt (1864–1908), a prominent jeweler of Galt &amp; Bro. The couple married on April 30, 1896, and lived in the capital for the next 12 years. In 1903, she bore a son who lived only for a few days. The difficult birth left her unable to have more children. In January 1908, Norman Galt died unexpectedly at the age of 43. Edith hired a manager to oversee his business, paid off his debts, and with the income left to her by her late husband, toured Europe.

==First Lady of the United States==

===Marriage to Woodrow Wilson===

In March 1915, the widow Galt was introduced to recently widowed U.S. President Woodrow Wilson at the White House by Helen Woodrow Bones (1874–1951). Bones was the president&#x27;s first cousin and served as the official White House hostess after the death of Wilson&#x27;s wife, Ellen Wilson. Wilson took an instant liking to Galt and proposed soon after meeting her. However, the couple were troubled by rumors that Wilson had cheated on his wife with Galt and even that Wilson and Galt had murdered the First Lady. Distressed at the effect such wild speculation could have on respect for the presidency and on his personal reputation, Wilson suggested that Edith Bolling Galt back out of their engagement. Instead, she insisted on postponing the wedding until the end of the official year of mourning for Ellen Axson Wilson. 

Wilson married Galt on December 18, 1915, at her home in Washington, D.C. There were 40 guests. The groom&#x27;s pastor, Reverend Dr. James H. Taylor of Central Presbyterian Church, and the bride&#x27;s, Reverend Dr. Herbert Scott Smith of St. Margaret&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C., officiated jointly at the ceremony.

===Early role as First Lady===
As First Lady during World War I, Edith Bolling Wilson had relatively few opportunities to be a social hostess, especially after the United States&#x27; entry into the war in April 1917. In wartime, she observed gasless Sundays, meatless Mondays, and wheatless Wednesdays to set an example for the federal rationing effort. Similarly, she set sheep to graze on the White House lawn rather than use manpower to mow it, and had their wool auctioned off for the benefit of the American Red Cross. Additionally, Edith Wilson became the first First Lady to travel to Europe during her term. She visited Europe with her husband on two separate occasions, in 1918 and 1919, to visit troops and to sign the Treaty of Versailles. During this time, her presence amongst the female royalty of Europe helped to cement America&#x27;s status as a world power and propelled the position of First Lady to an equivalent standing in international politics. Meanwhile, Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s health was failing under the stress of the presidency, and she devoted much effort to trying to keep him fit.

=== Increased role after husband&#x27;s stroke ===

Following his attendance at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Woodrow Wilson returned to the United States to campaign against strong non-interventionist sentiment for the ratification of the peace treaty and of the League of Nations Covenant. However, in October he suffered a stroke that left him bedridden and partially paralyzed.

Edith Wilson and others in the President&#x27;s inner circle (including his physician and a few close friends) hid the true extent of the president&#x27;s illness and disability from the American public. Edith also took over a number of routine duties and details of the executive branch of the government from the onset of Wilson&#x27;s illness until he left office almost a year and a half later. From October 1919 to the end of Wilson&#x27;s term on March 4, 1921, Edith, acting in a role she later described as a &quot;stewardship&quot;, decided who and which communications and matters of state were important enough to bring to the bedridden president. Edith Wilson later wrote: I studied every paper sent from the different Secretaries or Senators and tried to digest and present in tabloid form the things that, despite my vigilance, had to go to the President. I, myself, never made a single decision regarding the disposition of public affairs. The only decision that was mine was what was important and what was not, and the very important decision of when to present matters to my husband.Edith became the sole communication link between the President and his Cabinet. She required they send her all pressing matters, memos, correspondence, questions, and requests.

Edith took her role very seriously, even successfully pushing for the removal of Secretary of State Robert Lansing after he conducted a series of Cabinet meetings without the President (or Edith herself) present. She also refused to allow the British ambassador, Edward Grey, an opportunity to present his credentials to the president unless Grey dismissed an aide who was known to have made demeaning comments about her. She assisted President Wilson in filling out paperwork, and would often add new notes or suggestions. She was made privy to classified information, and was entrusted with the responsibility of encoding and decoding encrypted messages.

====Controversy====
In &quot;My Memoir&quot;, published in 1939, Edith Wilson justified her self-proclaimed role of presidential &quot;steward&quot;, arguing that her actions on behalf of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s presidency were sanctioned by Wilson&#x27;s doctors; that they told her to do so for her husband&#x27;s mental health. Edith Wilson maintained that she was simply a vessel of information for President Wilson; however, others in the White House did not trust her. Some believed that the marriage between Edith and Woodrow was hasty and controversial. Others did not approve of the marriage because they believed that Woodrow and Edith had begun communicating with each other while Woodrow was still married to Ellen Wilson.

In 1921, Joe Tumulty (Wilson&#x27;s chief of staff) wrote: &quot;No public man ever had a more devoted helpmate, and no wife a husband more dependent upon her sympathetic understanding of his problems ... Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s strong physical constitution, combined with strength of character and purpose, has sustained her under a strain which must have wrecked most women.&quot; In subsequent decades, however, scholars were far more critical in their assessment of Edith Wilson&#x27;s tenure as First Lady. Phyllis Lee Levin concluded that the effectiveness of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s policies was unnecessarily hampered by his wife, &quot;a woman of narrow views and formidable determination&quot;. Judith Weaver opined that Edith Wilson underestimated her own role in Wilson&#x27;s presidency. While she may not have made critical decisions, she did influence both domestic and international policy given her role as presidential gatekeeper. Howard Markel, a medical historian, has taken issue with Edith Wilson&#x27;s claim of a benign &quot;stewardship&quot;. Markel has opined that Edith Wilson &quot;was, essentially, the nation&#x27;s chief executive until her husband&#x27;s second term concluded in March of 1921&quot;. While a widow of moderate education for her time, she nevertheless attempted to protect her husband and his legacy, if not the presidency, even if it meant exceeding her role as First Lady. This period of her life was dramatized in the 2021 historical fiction podcast &quot;Edith!&quot; starring Rosamund Pike.

==Later years==
Upon leaving the White House in March 1921, Edith and Woodrow Wilson moved into a home on S Street NW in Washington, D.C. There she cared for the former president until his death on February 3, 1924. In subsequent years, she headed the Woman&#x27;s National Democratic Club&#x27;s board of governors when the club opened formally in 1924 and published her memoir in 1939.

On December 8, 1941, the day after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war, taking pains to draw a link with Wilson&#x27;s April 1917 declaration of war. Edith Wilson was present during Roosevelt&#x27;s address to Congress. On April 14, 1945, she attended Roosevelt&#x27;s funeral at the White House. She later attended the January 20, 1961 inauguration of President John F. Kennedy.

Edith Wilson died of congestive heart failure on December 28, 1961, at age 89. She was to have been the guest of honor that day at the dedication ceremony for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia, on what would have been her husband&#x27;s 105th birthday. She was buried next to her husband at the Washington National Cathedral.

==Legacy==

Wilson left her home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, with a condition that it be made into a museum honoring her husband. The Woodrow Wilson House opened as a museum in 1964. To the Library of Congress, Mrs. Wilson donated first President Wilson&#x27;s presidential papers in 1939, then his personal library in 1946.

The Edith Bolling Wilson Birthplace Foundation &amp; Museum in Wytheville, Virginia was established in 2008. The foundation has stabilized the first lady&#x27;s birthplace and childhood home; it had been identified in May 2013 by Preservation Virginia as an Endangered Historic Site. The foundation&#x27;s programs and exhibits aspire to build public awareness &quot;honoring Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s name, the contributions she made to this country, the institution of the presidency, and for the example she sets for women.&quot; The Foundation shares First Lady Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s journey &quot;From Wytheville to The White House&quot;.

In 2015, a former historic bank building in Wytheville, located on Main Street, was dedicated to the First Lady and bears her name. Adapted as the Bolling Wilson Hotel, it serves Wytheville residents and travelers alike.

<text>Golden Gate Park is an urban park between the Richmond and Sunset districts of San Francisco, California, United States. It is the second-largest park in the city, containing , and the third-most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 24 million visitors annually.

The creation of a large park in San Francisco was first proposed in the 1860s. In 1865, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted proposed a park designed with species native to San Francisco. The plan was rejected for a Central Park-style park designed by engineer William Hammond Hall. The park was built atop shore and sand dunes in an unincorporated area known as the Outside Lands. Construction centered on planting trees and non-native grasses to stabilize the dunes that covered three-quarters of the park. The park opened in 1870.

Main attractions include cultural institutions such as the De Young Museum, California Academy of Sciences, and the Japanese Tea Garden; attractions such as the Conservatory of Flowers, the San Francisco Botanical Garden, the Beach Chalet, the Golden Gate Park windmills, and the National AIDS Memorial Grove. Recreational activities include bicycling, pedal boating, and concerts and events such as Outside Lands music festival and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass. Golden Gate Park is accessible by car and by public transportation.

Golden Gate Park earned the designation of National Historic Landmark and of California Historic Resource in 2004. The park is administered by the San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department, which began in 1871 to oversee the park&#x27;s development. Golden Gate Park is over three miles () long east to west, and about half a mile () north to south.

==History==
===Development===
In the 1860s, San Franciscans felt the need for a spacious public park similar to Central Park, which was then taking shape in New York City. Golden Gate Park was carved out of unpromising sand and shore dunes that were known as the Outside Lands, in an unincorporated area west of San Francisco&#x27;s then-current borders. In 1865, Frederick Law Olmsted proposed a plan for a park using native species suited for San Francisco&#x27;s dry climate; however, the proposal was rejected in favor of a Central Park-style park needing extensive irrigation. Conceived ostensibly for recreation, the underlying purpose of the park was housing development and the westward expansion of the city. Field engineer William Hammond Hall prepared a survey and topographic map of the park site in 1870 and became its commissioner in 1871. He was later named California&#x27;s first state engineer and developed an integrated flood control system for the Sacramento Valley. The park drew its name from the nearby Golden Gate Strait.

The plan and planting were developed by Hall and his assistant, John McLaren, who had apprenticed in Scotland, home of many of the 19th-century&#x27;s best professional gardeners. John McLaren, when asked by the Park Commission if he could make Golden Gate Park &quot;one of the beauty spots of the world,&quot; replied saying, &quot;With your aid gentleman, and God be willing, that I shall do.&quot; He also promised that he&#x27;d &quot;go out into the country and walk along a stream until he found a farm, and that he&#x27;d come back to the garden and recreate what nature had done.&quot; The initial plan called for grade separations of transverse roadways through the park, as Frederick Law Olmsted had provided for Central Park, but budget constraints and the positioning of the Arboretum and the Concourse ended the plan. In 1876, the plan was almost replaced by one for a racetrack, favored by &quot;the Big Four&quot; millionaires: Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, Collis P. Huntington, and Charles Crocker. Stanford, who was president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, was also one of the owners of the Ocean Railroad Company, which ran from Haight Street across the park to its south border, then out to the beach and north to a point near Cliff House. It was Gus Mooney who claimed land adjacent to the park on Ocean Beach. Many of Mooney&#x27;s friends also staked claims and built shanties on the beach to sell refreshments to the patrons of the park. Hall resigned, and the remaining park commissioners followed. In 1882 Governor George C. Perkins appointed Frank M. Pixley, founder and editor of The Argonaut, to the board of commissioners of San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. Pixley was adamant that the Mooney&#x27;s shanties be eliminated, and he found support with the San Francisco Police for park security. Pixley favored Stanford&#x27;s company by granting a fifty-year lease on the route that closed the park on three sides to competition. The original plan, however, was back on track by 1886, when streetcars delivered over 47,000 people to Golden Gate Park on one weekend afternoon (out of a population of 250,000 in the city).

The first stage of the park&#x27;s development centered on planting trees in order to stabilize the dunes that covered three-quarters of the park&#x27;s area. In order to transform the sand dunes into parkland, John McLaren grew bent grass seeds obtained from France for two years. Once the seeds were grown, he planted them over the sand to hold the ground together. After this success, McLaren introduced new species of plants to the land, and added over 700 new types of trees to California within the span of one year. By 1875, about 60,000 trees, mostly Eucalyptus globulus, Monterey pine, and Monterey cypress, had been planted. By 1879, that figure more than doubled to 155,000 trees over . Within his lifetime, McLaren is credited to have planted over two million trees within northern California as a whole. Another accomplishment of John McLaren is his creation of an open walking space along the Pacific shoreline on the western boundary of the park. Despite obstacles such as heavy tides and winds that carried sand inland towards the park, McLaren was able to build an esplanade by stacking thousands of tree boughs over the course of 20 years.

When he refused to retire at the customary age of 60 the San Francisco city government was bombarded with letters: when he reached 70, a charter amendment was passed to exempt him from forced retirement. On his 92nd birthday, two thousand San Franciscans attended a testimonial dinner that honored him as San Francisco&#x27;s number one citizen. He lived in McLaren Lodge in Golden Gate Park until he died in 1943, aged 96. McLaren Avenue, in Sea Cliff, near Lincoln Park is named after him.

In 1903, a pair of Dutch-style windmills were built at the extreme western end of the park. These pumped water throughout the park. The north windmill was restored to its original appearance in 1981 and is adjacent to Queen Wilhelmina tulip garden, a gift of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. These are planted with tulip bulbs for winter display and other flowers in appropriate seasons. The Murphy Windmill in the southwest corner of the park was restored in September 2011.

=== 1906 earthquake relief ===
After the great earthquake of San Francisco in 1906, Golden Gate Park became a site of refuge for many who found themselves without shelter. The undeveloped Outside Lands became a prime location to house these masses of people, and &quot;earthquake shacks&quot; popped up all throughout the area. Of the 26 official homeless encampments in the Golden Gate Park region, 21 were under the control of the United States Army.

The United States Army housed 20,000 people in military style encampments, and 16,000 of the 20,000 refugees were living at the Presidio. Within the Presidio were four major encampments including a camp exclusively for Chinese immigrants. Despite being simple lodgings, the army organized 3,000 tents into a geometric grid complete with streets and addresses. &quot;The Army constructed a virtual town with large residential barracks [with temporary] tented housing, latrines and bathhouses, laundries, and other services.&quot;

Not only was the standard of military organization high, but the social organization was also at an acceptable standard despite the aftermath of the earthquake and fires. Reports indicate that small communities formed within the tent neighborhoods. The children of the refugees established play areas, and the adults congregated in the mess halls to socialize.

In June 1906, the Presidio tent camps were shut down. To replace these tents the city of San Francisco built more permanent living quarters. As mentioned earlier these earthquake shacks were built to house those still homeless after the earthquake and subsequent fires. Army Union carpenters built the shacks, and residents paid off the cost of construction at a rate of two dollars a month for twenty-five months.

===Early 20th century===

During the Great Depression, the San Francisco Parks and Recreation Department ran out of public funds. Thus, the duties of the department were transferred to the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a government program designed to provide employment and community improvements during the economic woes of the 1930s. Within the park, the WPA was responsible for the creation of several features such as the Arboretum, the archery field, and the model yacht club. In addition, the WPA reconstructed 13 miles of roads throughout the park and built the San Francisco Police Department&#x27;s horse stables. Another WPA contribution, Anglers Lodge and the adjoining fly casting pools, is still in use today. It is home to the Golden Gate Angling &amp; Casting Club (formerly known as the San Francisco Fly Casting Club). The horseshoe pits were also created by WPA employees. The pits also came with two sculptures, one of a gentleman tossing a horse shoe and one of a white horse (which has since crumbled), both created by artist Jesse S. &quot;Vet&quot; Anderson.

Most of the water used for landscape watering and for various water features is now provided by groundwater from the city&#x27;s Westside Basin Aquifer. In the 1950s, the use of this effluent during cold weather caused some consternation, with the introduction of artificial detergents but before the advent of modern biodegradable products. These &quot;hard&quot; detergents would cause long-lasting billowing piles of foam to form on the creeks connecting the artificial lakes and could even be blown onto the roads, forming a traffic hazard.

===Summer of Love ===
Golden Gate Park is recognized as the birthplace of the Summer of Love. On January 14, 1967, the Human Be-In was held in the Polo Fields. Organized by artist Michael Bowen, the event was attended by almost 30,000 people. Famous artists such as Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg were in attendance, as calls for alternative lifestyles and expanded consciousness reflected the countercultural attitudes of the period. At the event, psychologist Timothy Leary coined the phrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out.&quot; Several months later, Scott McKenzie&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot; became an anthem for the Summer of Love. The eastern end of the Park was the epicenter of the Summer of Love, with an estimated 100,000 youth visiting the Haight-Ashbury district, where they embraced communal living and counter-establishment values. Hippie Hill was a central meeting place, and renowned artists like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison performed free concerts there during the Summer of Love.

=== Recent history ===
In 1983, Queen Elizabeth II visited Golden Gate Park during a tour of the West Coast. Her stop included a dinner at the De Young Museum, attended by then-President Ronald Reagan, Willie Mays, George Lucas, Joe DiMaggio, and Steve Jobs. About three blocks away from the museum, 5,000 people protested the Queen&#x27;s visit due to Britain&#x27;s role in The Troubles in Northern Ireland. In 2023, the FBI revealed an assassination plot against the Queen during her visit.

Today, Golden Gate Park is one of San Francisco&#x27;s core attractions, drawing more than 24 million visitors each year. It hosts several annual music and arts festivals, including Outside Lands and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass. Notable Outside Lands headliners have included Radiohead, Paul McCartney, Kendrick Lamar, Elton John, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Tyler, the Creator, and SZA.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Park became an epicenter of debate on which public city spaces should be made permanent car-free zones. In 2022, the Board of Supervisors voted 7-4 to keep the eastern section of John F. Kennedy Drive permanently car-free, a decision affirmed later that year by voters who defeated a ballot initiative which sought to revert the change. The section was subsequently renamed &quot;JFK Promenade.&quot;


==Music Concourse area==

The Music Concourse is a sunken, oval-shaped open-air plaza originally excavated for the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. Its focal point is the Spreckels Temple of Music, also called the &quot;Bandshell&quot;, where numerous music performances have been staged. During the fall, spring, and summer seasons, various food trucks are often parked behind the Bandshell, providing local food options to visitors of the Music Concourse. Parkwide bicycle and surrey rentals are also available behind the bandshell and at Haight and Stanyan on the east edge of Golden Gate Park. The area also includes a number of statues of various historic figures, four fountains, and a regular grid array of heavily pollarded trees. Since 2003, the Music Concourse has undergone a series of improvements to include an underground 800-car parking garage and pedestrianization of the plaza itself. It is surrounded by various cultural attractions, including:

===De Young Museum===


Named after M. H. de Young, the San Francisco newspaper magnate, the De Young Museum is a fine arts museum that was opened in January 1921. Its original building, the Fine Arts Building, was part of the 1894 Midwinter Exposition, of which Mr. de Young was the director. The Fine Arts Building featured several artists, twenty-eight of whom were female. One of these revolutionaries was Helen Hyde, who is featured in the De Young Museum today. Once the fair ended, the Egyptian-styled building remained open &quot;brimful and running over with art.&quot; Most of these pieces were paintings and sculptures purchased by De Young himself, and others were donations of household antiques from the older community, which were &quot;more sentimental than artistic.&quot; By 1916, the Fine Arts Building&#x27;s collection had grown to 1,000,000 items, and a more suitable museum was necessary.

Construction to build a new museum began in 1917. With funds donated by De Young, and Louis Mullgardt as head architect, the De Young Museum was completed in 1921 in a &quot;sixteenth century Spanish Renaissance design, with pale salmon colored façades that were burdened with rococo ornamentation.&quot; At its center was a 134-foot tower from which its wings extended. At the entrance was the Pool of Enchantment, which consisted of the sculptured Indian boys created by M. Earl Cummings. The museum contained four wings: the East Wing (featuring ever-changing paintings, sculptures and photography by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh); the Central Wing (famous American and European work); the Northeast wing (Asian collections); and the West Wing (artistic history of San Francisco).

The original De Young Memorial Museum stood for most of the twentieth century, until 2001 when it was completely rebuilt, reopening in 2005. The head-architects, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, when asked about their design, said they wanted to create a place &quot;where the art would be less hierarchically presented – more like contemporary art than like bijoux.&quot; The building is mostly constructed of copper, and its unique design was created with the idea that the &quot;building would be enhanced not only by sunlight but also by San Francisco&#x27;s constant fog.&quot; Since the opening of the De Young in 1921, its galleries have mostly changed, but some of the art originally featured during the fair and in the early twentieth century still exists in the museum today. The galleries of Asian art have since been relocated, but the De Young still features American art, Modern art, African art, textiles and sculptures, and special alternating exhibitions.

===Academy of Sciences===

The California Academy of Sciences was founded in 1853, just three years after California was made a state, making it the oldest scientific institution in the western United States. Evolutionist Charles Darwin corresponded on the initial organization of the early institution. The original museum consisted of eleven buildings built between 1916 and 1976 located on the former site of the 1894 Midwinter Fair&#x27;s Mechanical Arts Building in Golden Gate Park. The structure was largely destroyed in the 1989 earthquake and just three of the original buildings were conserved for the new construction: the African Hall, the North American Hall, and the Steinhart Aquarium. The new building opened in 2008 at the same location in the park. The present building encompasses 37,000 square meters and includes exhibits of natural history, aquatic life, astronomy, gems and minerals, and earthquakes.

The academy also contains a 2.5-acre living roof with almost 1.7 million native California plants and domes that cover the planetarium and rainforest exhibitions. The soil of the roof is six inches deep, which reduces storm water runoff by more than 90% and naturally cools the interior of the museum, thereby reducing the need for air-conditioning. The glass panels of the living roof also contain cells that collect more than 5% of the electricity needed to power the museum. Due to its eco-friendly materials and natural sources of energy, the California Academy of Sciences has been named the country&#x27;s only LEED-platinum certified museum, granted by the U.S. Green Building Council.

===Japanese Tea Garden===


The Japanese Tea Garden is the oldest public Japanese garden in the United States and occupies five of the 1,017 acres (412 ha) of the Golden Gate Park. It stands adjacent to the de Young Museum and is rumored to be the introduction site of the fortune cookie to America.

George Turner Marsh, an Australian immigrant, originally created the garden as a &quot;Japanese Village&quot; exhibit for the 1894 Midwinter Exposition. Following the fair, a handshake agreement with John McLaren would allow Japanese horticulturalist Makoto Hagiwara to take over the garden. Hagiwara would oversee modifications in the garden&#x27;s transition from a temporary exhibit to a permanent installment within the park. Hagiwara and his family would continue to occupy the garden, maintaining the landscape and design of the garden until 1942.

Hagiwara himself died in 1925, leaving the garden in the hands of his daughter, Takano Hagiwara, and her children. They lived there until 1942, when they were evicted from the gardens and forced into internment camps by way of Executive Order 9066. During World War II, anti-Japanese sentiment led to the renaming of the garden as the &quot;Oriental Tea Garden&quot;. After the war, a letter-writing campaign enabled the garden to be formally reinstated as the Japanese Tea Garden in 1952. In January 1953, &quot;a classical Zen garden was added to the Tea Garden&quot; as well as the Lantern of Peace. The Lantern of Peace, weighing 9,000 pounds, was a gift from the Japanese Government as a way to mend the relationship between the U.S. and Japan that was damaged from World War II. In addition, a plaque, designed by Ruth Asawa, now stands at the entrance of the gardens as a tribute meant to honor Hagiwara and his family for their care-taking of the gardens. The garden also still has features such as the Drum Bridge and the Tea House from the Midwinter Exposition.

As is typical among Japanese style tea gardens, the Golden Gate Park&#x27;s tea garden has its own stepping stone pathways, stone lanterns, and variety of plants. In the mix there are dwarf trees, bamboo, and azaleas adorning the gardens.

The Japanese Tea Garden serves as a spot of tranquility in the middle of the various activities that take place at the Golden Gate Park and provides visitors &quot;a place in which it is possible to be at one with nature, its rhythms, and changing beauties.&quot; The Japanese Tea Garden brings in more than $1 million to the Golden Gate Park and the city annually. There is a constant debate whether or not changes should be made to the garden. Adding souvenir shops and a diversity of food options at the garden historically brings in more money to the organization monitoring the Golden Gate Park, the Recreation and Park Commission. Selling products that share knowledge about Japanese gardens and culture also helps maintain the Japanese Tea Garden&#x27;s authenticity.

== Structures and buildings ==
===Conservatory of Flowers===
==== History ====
The Conservatory of Flowers opened in 1879 and stands today as the oldest building in Golden Gate Park. The Conservatory of Flowers is one of the largest conservatories in the US, as well as one of few large Victorian greenhouses in the United States. Built of traditional wood and glass panes, the Conservatory stands at 12,000 square feet and houses 1,700 species of tropical, rare and aquatic plants. Though it was not originally constructed, William Hammond Hall included the idea of a conservatory in his original concept for the design of the park. The idea was later realized with the help of twenty-seven of the wealthiest business owners in San Francisco.

In 1883, a boiler exploded and the main dome caught fire. A restoration was undertaken by Southern Pacific magnate Charles Crocker. It survived the earthquake of 1906, only to suffer another fire in 1918. In 1933 it was declared unsound and closed to the public, only to be reopened in 1946. In 1995, after a severe storm with winds damaged the structure, shattering 40% of the glass, the conservatory was closed again. It was cautiously dissected for repairs and reopened in September 2003.

==== Rooms within the Conservatory ====
*The &quot;Potted Plants Gallery&quot; follows Victorian architecture and the 19th century idea of displaying tropical plants in non-tropical parts of the world.
*The &quot;Lowlands Gallery&quot; contains plants from the tropics of South America (near the equator).
* The &quot;Highlands Gallery&quot; contains native plants from South to Central America.
* The &quot;Aquatic Plants&quot; room is similar in conditions as those near the Amazon River.

=== Beach Chalet ===

The two-story Beach Chalet faces the Great Highway and Ocean Beach at the far western end of the park. It contains two restaurants and murals from the 1930s.

=== Windmills ===


Before the construction of its windmills, Golden Gate Park paid the Spring Valley Water Works up to 40 cents per 1000 gallons of water. To avoid this expense the North (Dutch) Windmill was commissioned in 1902 when Superintendent John McLaren deemed the park&#x27;s pumping plant insufficient to supply the additional water essential to the life of the park. A survey and inspection of the vast area west of Strawberry Hill revealed a large flow of water toward the ocean. The North windmill was constructed to reclaim the drainage towards the Pacific Ocean and direct fresh well water back into the park. Alpheus Bull Jr., a prominent San Franciscan, designed the North Windmill. The Fulton Engineering Company received the bid for the ironwork, and Pope and Talbot Lumber Company donated sails (&quot;spars&quot;) of Oregon pine. The North Windmill was installed, standing 75 feet tall with 102-footlong sails. The windmill pumps water an elevation of 200 feet with a capacity of 30,000 gallons of water per pump per hour, supplying and replenishing Lloyd Lake, Metson Lake, Spreckels Lake, and Lincoln Park. The water is pumped from the valley into a reservoir on Strawberry Hill. From there the water runs downhill into Falls and Blue Heron Lake. The North Windmill was successful, causing another system of wells and a second windmill at the southwestern corner of the park to be recommended. Samuel G. Murphy provided $20,000 to erect the windmill. The South Windmill (Murphy Windmill) stands as the largest in the world, having the longest sails in the world since its construction, with the ability to lift 40,000 gallons of water per hour.

=== Sculpture ===
A statue of longtime park superintendent John McLaren stands in the Rhododendron Dell. McLaren had this statue hidden and it was only placed in the dell after his death. Other statues of historical figures are also located throughout the park, including Francis Scott Key, Robert Emmet, Robert Burns, the double monument to Johann Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, General Pershing, Beethoven, Giuseppe Verdi, President Garfield, and Thomas Starr King. A bronze statue of Don Quixote and his companion, Sancho Panza kneeling to honor their creator, Cervantes, combines historical and fictitious characters. At the Horseshoe Court in the northeast corner of the park near Fulton and Stanyan, there is a concrete bas-relief of &quot;The Horseshoe Pitcher&quot; by Jesse &quot;Vet&quot; Anderson, a member of the Horseshoe Club. Across from the Conservatory of Flowers is Douglas Tilden&#x27;s &quot;The Baseball Player&quot;.

During the George Floyd protests, on June 19, 2020, demonstrators toppled or otherwise vandalized the statues of Catholic missionary Junípero Serra, Francis Scott Key (author of the lyrics to &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;), Ulysses S. Grant, Cervantes, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The archbishop of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone, described the toppling of the saint&#x27;s statue as &quot;an act of sacrilege [and] an act of the evil one&quot;, and on June 27 performed an exorcism at the site using the Prayer to Saint Michael.

In the northwest corner of the park, near the Beach Chalet, is a monument to explorer Roald Amundsen and the &quot;Gjøa&quot;, the first vessel to transit the Northwest Passage. Following the expedition, &quot;Gjøa&quot; was donated to the city in 1906 and put on display for decades near Ocean Beach. After falling into disrepair, &quot;Gjøa&quot; was returned to Norway in 1972.

=== Prayer Book Cross ===
The Prayer Book Cross, also known as Drake&#x27;s Cross, is a sandstone Celtic-style cross measuring 60 feet tall. Erected by Episcopalians in 1894, it commemorates Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s first landing on the West Coast in 1579, the first use of the Book of Common Prayer in California and (from the inscription) the &quot;First Christian service in the English tongue on our coast.&quot; It is located near Rainbow Falls on Crossover Drive between the John F. Kennedy Promenade and Park Presidio Drive. The cross was meant to be visible to ships at sea but has since been overgrown by trees. A gift of George W. Childs, it was designed by the architectural firm Coxhead &amp; Coxhead of San Francisco.

=== Carousel ===
William Hammond Hall persuaded officials to build the Children&#x27;s House and Play Ground, designed by Percy &amp; Hamilton, finished in 1888, and funded by William Sharon″s bequest. It was the first public children&#x27;s playground in the United States, for children and their mothers, offering swings, indoor enclosures, open sitting areas and a steam-powered carousel. The two-story Sharon Children&#x27;s House now houses the Sharon Art Studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/Sharon-ggp-children&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, a steam-powered carousel was installed in a circular building near the Children&#x27;s House and Play Ground. The carousel building was occupied by two more carousels before the 1914 Herschell-Spillman Company carousel was purchased by Herbert Fleishhacker from the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1941. The 1914 carousel has undergone several major renovations, the first, a transition from steam to electric power with the assistance of the PG&amp;E Company.

In 1977, the carousel closed for safety concerns and The San Francisco Arts Commission hired local artist Ruby Newman to oversee the artistic restoration. Her crew of craftspeople restored the badly deteriorated carousel and hand painted all animals, chariots, painted landscapes of the bay area and decorative housing (she holds the copyright), re-opening in 1984. Presently, the carousel includes sixty two animals, and a German Band Organ. Two of the animals, a goat and an &quot;Outside Row Stander Carousel Horse&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pafa/orsCh&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tJm/orsCh&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; are by the Dentzel Wooden Carousel Company.

In 2007, the Koret Foundation funded a $3.8 million renovation, later called the Koret Playground/Children’s Quarter.

== Transportation ==
===Public transport===
The San Francisco Muni Metro runs along the southern edge of the park. Access to the park on the westbound N Judah line begins at the Carl and Stanyan station, located one block from Kezar Stadium. The line continues along the entirety of the park, and includes access to the California Academy of Sciences and De Young Museum at the 9th Avenue and Irving station; Blue Heron Lake at the Judah and 19th Avenue station; Polo Fields at the Judah and Sunset station; and the Beach Chalet Soccer Fields at the line&#x27;s western terminus at the Judah and La Playa station.

Various bus routes pass through Golden Gate Park or stop along its boundaries. The 18 bus stops along the Great Highway on the western end of the park. The 5 Fulton runs along the northern boundary of the park along Fulton Street. The 33 Ashbury/18th Street stops along the eastern edge of the park in Haight-Ashbury. The 7 Haight/Noriega also stops in the Haight, running about halfway along the southern end of the park. The 43 Masonic stops near the Pandhandle on the far eastern end of the park. The 44 and 28 both run through the park.

== Natural features ==

===San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum===

The San Francisco Botanical Garden was laid out in the 1890s, but funding was insufficient until Helene Strybing willed funds in 1926. Planting began in 1937 with WPA funds supplemented by local donations. This arboretum contains more than 7,500 plant species. The arboretum also houses the Helen Crocker Russell Library, northern California&#x27;s largest horticultural library.

Due to the unique climate of San Francisco and Golden Gate Park, the plants in the San Francisco Botanical Garden range from a variety of different national origins, some of them no longer existing in their natural habitats. Areas of origin include but are not limited to Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Central and South America. These regions of origin go from desert to tropical. In addition, some native California species are housed in the garden as well, such as Redwood trees. Overall, the tradition of these diverse gardens that eventually served to inspire the San Francisco Botanical Garden comes originally from China, Europe, and Mexico.

===Lakes===
Blue Heron Lake, formerly known as Stow Lake, surrounds the prominent Strawberry Hill, now an island with an electrically pumped waterfall. The lake was originally named for William W. Stow, a known anti-Semite, who gave $60,000 for its construction. Strawberry Hills&#x27; waterfall was named Huntington Falls after its benefactor Collis P. Huntington. Blue Heron Lake was the first artificial lake constructed in the park and Huntington was the park&#x27;s first artificial waterfall. The falls are fed by a reservoir located atop Strawberry Hill. Water is pumped into the reservoir from Elk Glen Lake, the South Windmill, wells, and the city&#x27;s water supply to keep the system of lakes flowing eastward from Blue Heron Lake.

Rowboats and pedalboats can be rented at the boathouse. Much of the western portion of San Francisco can be seen from the top of this hill. The reservoir at its top also supplies a network of high-pressure water mains that exclusively supply specialized fire hydrants throughout the city. The lake itself also serves as a reservoir from which water is pumped to irrigate the rest of the park should other pumps stop operating.

In the past the Hill was also topped by Sweeny Observatory, but the building was ruined by the 1906 earthquake and plans to replace it were not approved by park commissioners.

Two bridges connect the inner island to the surrounding mainland: the Roman Bridge and the Stone (or Rustic) Bridge. The Stone Bridge is a prominent background feature in the 1915 American silent comedy short &quot;Wished on Mabel&quot;, starring Mabel Normand and Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle.

In October 2022, three San Francisco city supervisors introduced a resolution urging the Recreation and Park Commission to rename the lake due to William Stow&#x27;s outspoken antisemitism, as part of an effort to rename various landmarks across the San Francisco Bay Area. In January 2024, the Commission decided on the new name of &quot;Blue Heron Lake&quot;, in honor of the blue herons that nest along the lake.

Spreckels Lake

Spreckels Lake is an artificial reservoir behind a small earthen dam that lies on the north side of the Golden Gate Park between Spreckels Lake Drive and Fulton Street to the north, and John F. Kennedy Drive to the south. It is named after sugar-fortune heir and then San Francisco Parks Commissioner Adolph B. Spreckels. Built between 1902 and 1904 at the request of the San Francisco Model Yacht Club specifically as a model boating facility, the lake was first filled in February 1904 and opened March 20, 1904. One can usually find both &#x27;sail driven,&#x27; self-guided Yachts and electric or gas/nitro powered radio-controlled model boats of many types and designs plying the lake&#x27;s waters most times of year.

Alvord Lake is located at the eastern end of the park near the intersection of Haight and Stanyan streets. It was named for William Alvord, Park Commissioner in the 1870s, and Mayor of San Francisco from 1871 to 1873, who financed its construction in 1882. A few yards west of the lake is the Alvord Lake Bridge, the oldest known reinforced concrete bridge built in the United States.

Elk Glen Lake is the park&#x27;s deepest ornamental lake, measuring over 6 ft. deep on average. The lake acts as a reservoir for water from the Reclamation Plant before it is pumped to either Blue Heron Lake or the reservoir atop Strawberry Hill.

Mallard Lake is landlocked and not a part of the park&#x27;s irrigation system.

Metson Lake lies west of Mallard Lake and east of the Chain of Lakes. This body of water has a capacity of over 1.1 million gallons that overflow into South Lake or can be redirected elsewhere for irrigation purposes.

Chain of Lakes Many naturalistically landscaped lakes are placed throughout the park: several are linked together into chains, with pumped water creating flowing creeks. Out of the original 14 natural marshy lakes within the sand dunes Golden Gate Park was built in, only 5 remain, three of which are the Chain of Lakes. The three lakes, North, Middle, and South Lake, are located along the Chain of Lakes Drive.

North Lake is the largest of the three, and is known for its water birds that often live on the small islands within the lake. Some of the birds spotted are egrets, belted kingfishers, ducks, and great blue herons. It is surrounded by a paved walkway that is often used by families, joggers, and dog walkers.

In 1898, McLaren started a landscaping project, inspired by Andrew Jackson Downing&#x27;s teachings on building with nature. Seven islands were planted within the North Lake in 1899, using different species of shrubs and trees. A gazebo was built, and wooden footbridges were used to connect the different islands within the lake. Both the gazebo and the bridges were removed in order to conserve nesting birds on the islands.

North Lake is the final of the Chain of Lakes that flow into each other south to north, making it the final destination of the lakes&#x27; water pumped in from the Water Reclamation Plant. Should the plant&#x27;s water not meet the lake&#x27;s needs the water level is maintained by well water pumped from the North Windmill.

Middle Lake is particularly known for bird-watching due to the visits of migrant species of birds like tanagers, warblers and vireos. It is surrounded by a dirt trail and vegetation. The lake resembles the marshes that existed before Golden Gate Park, and is known for being a more remote and romantic setting.

South Lake is the smallest of the three lakes, and borders Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This lake is the smallest in the Chain of Lakes. Its water is sourced from either a direct flow from Metson Lake, or by Blue Heron Lake water released by a valve. It does not contribute to irrigation in the park but it does feed into Middle Lake. Its noteworthy bird population is its ducks.

===Bison Paddock===
Bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;) have been kept in Golden Gate Park since 1891, when a small herd was purchased by the park commission. At the time, the animal&#x27;s population in North America had dwindled to an all-time low, and San Francisco made a successful effort to breed them in captivity. In 1899, the paddock in the western section of the park was created. At its peak and through a successful captive breeding program, more than 100 calves were produced at Golden Gate Park, helping preserve the iconic bison population numbers in North America, which has been critical to the culture and livelihood of Native Americans.

In 1984, Mayor Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s husband, Richard C. Blum, purchased a new herd as a birthday present for his wife. The older bison in the paddock today are descendants of this herd.

In December 2011, after the number of bison in the paddock had dwindled to three, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma&#x27;s office led another preservation effort. With donations from the Theodore Rosen Charitable Foundation, Richard C. Blum, and the Garen Wimer Ranch, Assemblywoman Ma&#x27;s office worked with the San Francisco Zoo and San Francisco Recreation and Parks to add seven new bison to the existing herd. The paddock is open to the public for viewing.

=== Hippie Hill ===

Nestled in the trees between the Conservatory of Flowers and Haight Street, Hippie Hill displays a lifestyle unique to San Francisco. East of the Golden Gate Park tennis courts, the green space known as Hippie Hill is a gentle sloping lawn just off of Kezar Drive and overlooking Robin Williams Meadow, with Eucalyptus and Oak on either side. Additionally, the hill contains several uncommon trees: coast banksia, titoki, turpentine, and cow-itch.

Hippie Hill has been a part of San Francisco&#x27;s history, namely the Summer of Love, in 1967, a large counterculture movement that partially took place on the hill. With its close proximity to Haight Street, the main site of the Summer of Love, the movement often overflowed onto the hill. During this era, people gathered in the area to connect with one another through many activities, including the playing of music, consumption of LSD and marijuana, and expression of hippie ideals. With time, area residents began to complain of the flower children&#x27;s open sexuality, nude dancing, panhandling, and excess litter.

Through this movement, music came to have its own history on the hill as well. Musicians and bands such as Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison all played free shows for the public near by. Today, improvised drum circles form on the weekends where people come together and fill the hill with a constant beat for hours on end. A space filled with their culture, the hill played a major part in the hippies&#x27; ability to openly use drugs and express themselves as the police adopted a policy of looking the other way.

Though the police have been known to crack down on certain occurrences in the park, the SFPD are lenient with activity on the hill. Starting from the Summer of Love when the police were unable to address the enormity of the situation, some activity is overlooked. As supervisor London Breed stated, &quot;smoking anything in any city park is illegal, but San Francisco has a tradition of turning a blind eye to infractions for official or unofficial events.&quot; The police department has stated that they are not naïve enough to attempt to catch all the people smoking marijuana on the hill, but as Police Chief Greg Suhr said, &quot;There are plenty of other things that come with it that we will not have.&quot;

=== Plants ===
A diverse collection of plants, from all over the world, can be found in Golden Gate Park. Acacias, like the Sydney golden wattle from Australia, were some of the first planted in the park by William Hammond Hall to stabilize the sand dunes. They still play that role in the western portion of the park and are common all around the park.

While ninety-six percent of the park is considered not a natural area, four out of the thirty-two San Francisco locations designated as natural areas by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department&#x27;s Natural Areas Program are found in Golden Gate Park. These are the Oak Woodlands, the Lily Pond, Strawberry Hill, and Whiskey Hill.

The California live oak is the only tree native to the park. Some of the oldest plants in the park are the coast live oaks in the Oak Woodlands in the northeastern portion of the park which are hundreds of years old. Oaks also grow on Strawberry Hill and in the AIDS Memorial Grove. Acorns from the oak trees were an important food source to Native American groups in San Francisco.

Other than the oak trees, the plants that are currently in the park are non-native, some of which are considered invasive species. Many have disrupted the ecosystem and harm birds, mammals, reptiles, and insects in the park. Volunteers with the Strawberry Hill Butterfly Habitat Restoration Project are removing and replacing invasive plant species to help restore the butterfly population on Strawberry Hill. Under the Significant Natural Resource Areas Management Plan, the city will remove many invasive species and replace them with native plants.

Blue gum eucalyptus, Monterey pine, and Monterey cypress were the most commonly planted trees in the park during the late 1800s. Blue gum continued to grow and spread and is now one of the most important trees found in the park. They can be found near McLaren Lodge, on Hippie Hill, and in a eucalyptus forest near Middle Lake. Monterey pines are also prevalent today and can found in the Strybing Arboretum, the Japanese Tea Garden, and in the western portions of the park around the Buffalo Paddock.

Redwoods were planted in the park during the 1880s and can be found all around the park, most notably in Heroes Grove, Redwood Memorial Grove, AIDS Memorial Grove, Stanyan Meadows, on top of Hippie Hill, and in the Panhandle.

Tree ferns were planted early on by McLaren and continue to thrive in the park. Many can be found in the Tree Fern Dell, near the Conservatory of Flowers, which is made up of mostly Tasmanian tree fern.

=== Wild animals ===
In 2013, San Francisco photographer David Cruz shot pictures of coyote pups in Golden Gate Park. It is estimated that over 100 coyotes live in San Francisco, and there have been more sightings in Golden Gate Park than any other spot in the city. Coyotes have proven adaptive in the city, as they live primarily in open prairies and deserts. Mountain lions occasionally roam the park. The first colony of great blue herons to nest in San Francisco was discovered at Blue Heron Lake in Golden Gate Park in 1993 by Nancy DeStefani and has been continuously returning to the park during the breeding season since then. The heronry features in &quot;Heron Island&quot; (1998), a short documentary directed by filmmaker Judy Irving.

==Dedicated areas and memorials==

=== National AIDS Memorial Grove ===

In the decades following the first reports of AIDS in the United States in 1981, some Americans were overwhelmed with the devastation of the AIDS epidemic. In 1988 a few San Franciscans belonging to communities hit hard by the AIDS epidemic envisioned a place of remembrance for those who had died from AIDS. They imagined a serene AIDS memorial where people could go to heal. Renovation for the National Aids Memorial Grove began in September 1991 and continues today as communities are constantly working to improve it. Located at 856 Stanyan Street, in the eastern portion of Golden Gate Park, the Grove stretches across seven acres of land. In 1996, due to Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s efforts, the &quot;National AIDS Memorial Grove Act&quot; was passed by Congress and the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, which officially made those seven acres of Golden Gate Park the first AIDS memorial in the United States. Then in 1999, it earned the Rudy Bruner Silver Medal Award for excellence in the urban environment.

Due to its serene environment of redwoods, maples, ferns, benches, logs, and boulders, this memorial remains a place where people go to grieve, hope, heal, and remember. Located at the Dogwood Crescent the Circle of Friends is the heart of the grove. The Circle of Friends has over 1,500 names inscribed on its flagstone ground which represent lives lost to AIDS. If one wishes to inscribe a name into the Circle of Friends they must donate $1,000 to the memorial and the name will be inscribed before the Worlds AIDS day commemoration on December 1. Funded privately and tended by over 500 of volunteers, The National AIDS Memorial Grove remains a sanctuary for remembrance.

On November 30 an annual Light in the Grove fundraising gala is held in the Grove. This event, held on the eve of Worlds Aids Day, sells out each year and was voted &quot;Best Bay Area LGBT Fundraiser&quot; by &quot;Bay Area Reporter&quot; readers in 2015.

=== Shakespeare Garden ===
The Shakespeare Garden is a relatively small &quot;17th century classical garden&quot; located directly southwest of the California Academy of Sciences. It is a tribute to William Shakespeare and his works, decorated with flowers and plants that are mentioned in his plays. The entrance is an ornate metal gate that says &quot;Shakespeare Garden&quot; intertwined with vines. Directly past the entrance is a walkway overarched with trees and lined with small flowers and a sundial in the center. The main area has a large moss tree and benches. At the end of the garden there is a wooden padlocked shelf containing a bust of William Shakespeare. The cast was made and given to the garden by George Bullock in 1918 and has remained behind locked doors since around 1950 to prevent people from cutting off pieces of the bronze statue to melt down. Around the bust, there are four plaques, originally six, with quotes from Shakespeare. The missing two were stolen and most likely sold and melted down so the thieves could make a profit from the bronze the plaques were made from.

Alice Eastwood, the director of botany from the California Academy of Sciences at the time, came up with the idea for the garden in 1928, and it was carried out by Katherine Agnes Chandler. It however is not unique, as there are several Shakespeare gardens around the world, including &quot;Cleveland, Manhattan, Vienna, and Johannesburg.&quot; The garden is a popular spot for weddings. There are over 200 plants mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

===Rose Garden===
The Rose Garden is found between the John F. Kennedy Promenade and Park Presidio Boulevard.

===Dahlia Garden===
The Dahlia Garden is found just to the East of the Conservatory of Flowers, and is maintained by volunteers from the Dahlia Society of California, founded in 1917.

== Sports and recreation ==
Golden Gate park contains many areas for sports and recreation including tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball fields, lawn bowling fields, an angling and casting club, a disc golf course, horseshoe pits, an archery range, the polo field, and Kezar Stadium. Golden Gate park formed the first Lawn Bowling Club in the United States in 1901, with an Edwardian style clubhouse constructed in 1915.

=== Kezar Stadium ===

Kezar Stadium was built between 1922 and 1925 in the southeast corner of the park. It hosted various athletic competitions throughout its existence. It served as the home stadium of the San Francisco 49ers of the AAFC and NFL from 1946 to 1970, and for one season in 1960, it hosted the Oakland Raiders of the AFL

The 59,000-seat stadium was demolished in 1989 and replaced with a modern 9,044-seat stadium, which includes a replica of the original concrete arch at the entryway.

The stadium has been used in recent years for soccer, lacrosse, and track and field. The stadium also holds the annual city high school football championship, the Turkey Bowl. The Turkey Bowl dates to 1924 and is played each Thanksgiving. The game was held at Lowell High School in 2014 because Kezar was closed due to renovation of the running track. Galileo High School has the most overall wins in the game (16) after breaking Lincoln High School&#x27;s record four-game winning streak in 2009.

The stadium also hosts the football game in the three-part Bruce-Mahoney Trophy competition between Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory and Saint Ignatius College Preparatory, two Catholic high schools in San Francisco, in addition to serving as the home field for Sacred Heart Cathedral&#x27;s football program.

=== The Polo Field ===


The sport of polo came to California in 1876, when the California Polo Club was established with help of Bay Area native, Captain Nell Mowry. By the late 1800s, polo in San Francisco was dominated by the Golden Gate Driving Club and the San Francisco Driving Club. In 1906, the Golden Gate Park Stadium was built by private subscription from the driving clubs which contained both a polo field and a cycling velodrome. Later on, the stadium was renamed simply the Polo Field. In the mid-1930s, the City and County of San Francisco used PWA and WPA funds to renovate the polo field. In 1939, additional WPA funds were used to build polo sheds, replacing already-standing horse stables. Polo continued being played through the 1940s but by the 1950s polo stopped being played on the Polo Field because the sport had largely migrated to other bay area cities where land more suitable for polo was available. In 1985 and 1986, polo was brought back to the Polo Field in Golden Gate Park for the second and third annual San Francisco Grand Prix and Equestrian Festival. Today, polo is not regularly played on the Polo Field, but from 2006 to 2010 Polo in the Park was hosted annually.

The Polo Fields has a history of cycling lasting from 1906 to the 21st century. The Polo Fields were originally created for track cycling in 1906, as track cycling was a popular sport in the early 1900s. Despite a down-surge of popularity in the mid-1900s, track cycling has seen a rebirth ever since the introduction of more track cycling programs in the Olympics in 2003. San Francisco has seen a surge in cycling popularity, and groups such as &quot;Friends of the Polo Field Cycling Track&quot; have recently formed.

The field has an extensive history with music and events. Because of the location and size of the Polo Fields, various events are commonly held on the field. Historically, many major music festivals took place in the park, including the Human Be-In, which featured bands like the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. More contemporary music festivals such as the Outside Lands and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass also take place on or nearby the Polo Fields. One of the largest public gatherings in San Francisco took place in the Polo Fields—a public Rosary in 1961 with 550,000 people. Public political events were also held at the field, such as the anti-Vietnam War rally in 1969 and the Tibetan Freedom Concert in 1996.

Now in the 21st century, the Polo Field is split into two divisions: the inner soccer field, and the flat-style cycling velodrome found around the field itself. Today many sports are played in the polo fields, including soccer, cross country running, and various types of cycling. The cycling track is still alive, with a large number of time-trial races held every cycling season. A cyclist in 2013 set a record in the park by riding a total of 188.5 miles on the Polo Field velodrome, circling it 279 times in just over twelve hours. In 2023 a new cycling track distance record was set at 201.0 miles over 296 laps in 11 hours 6 minutes.

=== Archery range ===
Archery was first organized in Golden Gate Park in 1881. However, there was not a devoted range specifically for archery until around 1933. In 1936, during Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, many parts of Golden Gate Park, including the archery range, were improved as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). With WPA support, the archery range was increased in size and the adjacent hill was carved to serve as a backdrop for stray arrows. Bales of hay are used as targets and are provided by the Golden Gate Joad Archery Club as well as donations from other donors. The Golden Gate Park Archery Range is located right inside the park off of 47th Street and Fulton Street. It is open whenever the park is open and is free to use by anyone. There is no staff and equipment is not offered to be rented at the range, however there are archery stores nearby for rentals and there are multiple groups that offer training and lessons.

== Golden Gate Park Nursery ==
Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has remained one of the few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners. The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive to the nursery, and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park.

==Homeless population==
In 2017, there were approximately 7,500 homeless people living in San Francisco. Around 40 to 200 of these people were estimated to reside in the park as of 2013. Around half of the homeless population in Golden Gate Park are short-term residents that leave after a certain amount of time, and the other half are more long-term residents. Short-term residents tend to be younger, while permanent residents tend to be older, military veterans. Most of the homeless population is male. It is estimated that around 60% of the population may have a mental disability. However, it is hard to gather data about the population due to its variability.

The city government of San Francisco has attempted to establish various outreach programs in order to help the homeless population. The city&#x27;s government stated in 2013 that &quot;current outreach efforts to inform park dwellers about support services are limited, and efforts that do take place are not documented in a way that makes it possible to analyze their efficiency or success&quot;.

The City of San Francisco has grappled with what to do about camps of homeless people living in Golden Gate Park, which have been criticized as unsanitary, and &quot;demoralizing&quot; for park users and workers. The camps have been described by journalists as full of garbage, broken glass, hypodermic needles, and human excrement, and the people in them are described as suffering from serious addictions and often behaving aggressively with police and park gardeners. There have been occasional incidents of violence against homeless people in the park, including the 2010 park beating to death of a homeless man and an attack on park visitors by dogs owned by a park resident, also in 2010. In the 1990s, then-Mayor Willie Brown sought unsuccessfully to borrow the Oakland Police Department&#x27;s helicopters in order to find homeless people&#x27;s camps.

Starting in 1988 under then-mayor Art Agnos, and continuing under the direction of subsequent mayors including Frank Jordan, Willie Brown, and Gavin Newsom, San Francisco police have conducted intermittent sweeps of the park aimed at eliminating the camps. Tactics have included information campaigns designed to inform homeless residents about city services available to help them; waking sleeping homeless people and making them leave the park; issuing citations for infractions and misdemeanors such as camping, trespassing, or public intoxication, which carry penalties of $75 to $100; and the seizure and removal from the park of homeless people&#x27;s possessions. During the night, police urge visitors to Golden Gate Park to be careful around homeless people.

The crackdowns have been criticized by anti-poverty activists and civil liberties groups, who say the measures attack only the symptoms of homelessness, while ignoring its root causes, and criminalize the poor for their poverty while ignoring their property rights and constitutional rights. In 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit against the city government on behalf of 10 homeless people, alleging property violations by the city during sweeps in Golden Gate Park the year before.

<text>Ellen Louise Axson Wilson (May 15, 1860 – August 6, 1914) was the first lady of the United States from 1913 until her death in 1914, as the first wife of President Woodrow Wilson. Like her husband, she was a Southerner, as well as the daughter of a clergyman. She was born in Savannah, Georgia, but raised in Rome, Georgia. Having an artistic bent, she studied at the Art Students League of New York before her marriage, and continued to produce art in later life.

During her tenure as First Lady, she arranged White House weddings for two of their daughters. She was the third First Lady and the most recent to die during her tenancy.

==Biography==
Ellen Louise Axson, born in Savannah, Georgia, was the daughter of the Reverend Samuel Edward Axson, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife Margaret Jane (née Hoyt) Axson. Ellen became a woman of refined tastes with a fondness for art, music, and literature. When she was eleven years old, she began studying art at Rome Female College in Rome, Georgia. After her graduation in 1876, Ellen&#x27;s drawing titled &quot;School Scene&quot; was submitted to the Paris International Exposition. where it won a bronze medal for excellence.

In April 1883, she met Woodrow Wilson when he was visiting his cousin Jesse Woodrow Wilson in Rome, Georgia, on family business. At that time, she was keeping house for her widowed father. Woodrow Wilson thought of Ellen, &quot;What splendid laughing eyes!&quot; They were engaged 5 months later, but postponed the wedding while he did postgraduate work at Johns Hopkins University and she nursed her ailing father. Ellen&#x27;s father committed suicide while hospitalized for depression, after which she went North to study at the Art Students League of New York.

Wilson, who was 28 years of age, married Ellen, age 25, on June 24, 1885, at her paternal grandparents&#x27; home in Savannah, Georgia. The wedding was performed jointly by his father, the Reverend Joseph R. Wilson, and her grandfather, the Reverend Isaac Stockton Keith Axson. They honeymooned at Waynesville, a mountain resort in western North Carolina.

That same year, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania offered Dr. Wilson a teaching position at an annual salary of $1,500. He and his bride lived near the campus, keeping her little brother with them.

Together, the Wilsons had three daughters:
*Margaret Woodrow Wilson (1886–1944) - singer, businesswoman, Hindu nun (1940–44)
*Jessie Woodrow Wilson (1887–1933) - she worked three years at a settlement house in Philadelphia. She married Francis B. Sayre at the White House in 1913. They settled at Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Sayre joined the faculty of Harvard Law School. Jessie was active in the League of Women Voters, the YWCA, and as secretary of the Massachusetts Democratic Committee.
* Eleanor Randolph Wilson (1889–1967), she married Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo.
Insisting that her children must not be born as Yankees, Ellen went to stay with relatives in Gainesville, Georgia for Margaret&#x27;s birth in 1886 and Jessie&#x27;s in 1887. But Eleanor was born in Connecticut in 1889, while Wilson was teaching at Wesleyan University.

Wilson&#x27;s career at Princeton University began in 1890, bringing Ellen new social responsibilities. She took refuge from such demands in her art. As First Lady, she drew sketches and painted in a studio set up on the third floor of the White House. She donated much of her work to charity. She arranged the White House weddings of two of her daughters.

After Wilson was elected as president in 1912, the Wilsons preferred to begin the administration without an inaugural ball. The First Lady&#x27;s entertainments were simple, but her unaffected cordiality made her parties successful. In their first year, she convinced her scrupulous husband that it would be perfectly proper to invite influential legislators to a private dinner.
Wilson had grown up in a slave-owning family. As First Lady, she devoted much effort to the cause of improving housing in the national capital&#x27;s largely black slums. She visited dilapidated alleys and brought them to the attention of debutantes and Congressmen.

She died of Bright&#x27;s disease at the White House on August 6, 1914. She was buried in Rome, Georgia among her family at Myrtle Hill Cemetery.

In December 1915, President Woodrow Wilson remarried, to Edith Bolling Galt.

<text>Monemvasia (, or ) is a town and municipality in Laconia, Greece. The town is located in mainland Greece on a tied island off the east coast of the Peloponnese, surrounded by the Myrtoan Sea. Monemvasia is connected to the rest of the mainland by a tombolo in length.

In 1890, a small part of the natural tombolo was cut to create an artificial bridge for ships and boats. Its area consists mostly of a large plateau some above sea level, up to wide and long.

Founded in the sixth century, and thus one of the oldest continually-inhabited fortified towns in Europe, the town is the site of a once-powerful medieval fortress, and was at one point one of the most important commercial centres in the Eastern Mediterranean. The town&#x27;s walls and many Byzantine churches remain as testaments to the town&#x27;s history. Today, the seat of the municipality of Monemvasia is the town of Molaoi.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name derives from two Greek words, (, &#x27;single&#x27;) and &quot;emvasis&quot; (, &#x27;approach&#x27;), together meaning &quot;city of the single approach, or entrance&quot;. Its Italian form, &quot;Malvasia&quot;, gave its name to the eponymous wine. Monemvasia has been nicknamed &quot;the Gibraltar of the East&quot; ().

==History==
===Early history===
While uninhabited in antiquity, the island on which the town of Monemvasia is situated may have been the site of a Minoan trading post. Pausanias, the renowned Greek traveler and geographer, referred to the site as &quot;Akra Minoa&quot;, which translates to &quot;Minoan Promontory&quot;. The ancient settlement of Epidaurus Limera was located a little north of Monemvasia in ancient times. The region surrounding the two settlements has been inhabited since prehistoric times. During Roman times it flourished as the most important city on the eastern coast of the Malea peninsula. 

Pausanias visited Epidaurus Limera and said that opposite the city there was a promontory which he referred to as the &quot;extremity of Minos&quot;, which has been identified as Monemvasia. Strabo—a century earlier—mentions it as &quot;Minoan fortress&quot;. The toponym &quot;Minoa&quot; indicates the existence of a port in antiquity, traces of which have been discovered underwater. However, it is not known if there was a significant settlement on the island. It is possible that a settlement was established there in the 4th century, around the time when the capital of the Roman Empire moved from Rome to Constantinople, which resulted in changes in maritime trade routes. Epidaurus Limera itself was abandoned in the 4th century.

=== Establishment ===
Monemvasia was founded in the 6th century, from the relocation of the inhabitants of Ancient Sparta, which was then known as &quot;Lacedaemon&quot;. Sparta, unlike other cities that were abandoned, continued to be inhabited until the 6th century AD, despite earthquakes, Goth raids in 395 under Alaric I and Vandals in 468 under Gaiseric, and the plague epidemic of 541-543. According to the later Chronicle of Monemvasia, the city was abandoned after a Slav raid in 587-588, during the reign of Maurice. The Chronicle reports that its inhabitants left Sparta in panic and fortified themselves under the leadership of their bishop in Monemvasia while others settled in the passes of the region, while mentioning that many other cities of the Peloponnese were also abandoned in this way. However, archaeological findings do not generally concur with this view, and place the foundation of Monemvasia a few decades earlier, during the reign of Justinian. The first level of the basilica church of Christ Elkomenos in the center of the lower town dates from that time.

During Justinian&#x27;s reign, due to various disasters, either natural factors or raids, the cities experienced significant decline. Justinian proceeded with residential remodeling, moving entire cities&#x27; populations to new locations and often changing the city&#x27;s name. Such changes are mentioned by Procopius in &quot;On Buildings&quot;, though specific references to the Peloponnese are rare.

The 15th century text &quot;Report to the Patriarch&quot;, written by Isidoros, the metropolitan of Monemvasia, mentions that the movement of the population took place under Justinian. Another city that moved in the same period was Aipeia in Messenia, which moved to the current site of Koroni. Similarly, the location of Sparta was deemed insufficiently fortified and prone to long-term blockades due to its long distance from the port, while with the move of the capital to Constantinople, ships from Gytheion now had to sail around Cape Maleas.

Due to the aforementioned reasons, the city authorities proceeded not only to move the population of Sparta, establishing Monemvasia, but also to reorganize the settlements of southeastern Laconia. The reorganization included settlement in the mountain passes of Parnon and the migration from Gytheion. The &quot;Chronicle of Monemvasia&quot; states that part of the population relocated as far away as Sicily. Because the rebuilding, moving, and settling of the population at the new location must have been completed several years later, it is likely that the two cities coexisted for some time. Along with the inhabitants, the seat of the diocese of Lacedaemonia was also moved, although it kept its old name.

=== Byzantine period ===
Unlike other settlements in the Peloponnese region that saw their decline from the 7th century onwards—a period known as the Dark Ages—Monemvasia developed into a commercial and cultural centre due to its location on important sea routes, such as the one that connected it to Sicily. A bronze coin minted in Sicily of Philippikos Bardanes was found in the lower town. The oldest known mention of Monemvasia dates from the third decade of the 8th century, and is made by the pilgrim Vilibaldos, who traveled from the Sicilian Holy Land with a stopover in Monemvasia. Monemvasia is also mentioned by Theophanes the Confessor, who describes the arrival of the plague in Byzantium in 746-747.
Monemvasia&#x27;s key position on the sea route to the eastern Mediterranean made it the target of pirate raids in the following centuries, along with raids by Western rulers. Arab raids began in the 9th century and after their settlement in Crete, after which the raids multiplied. One such raid is mentioned in the so-called &quot;Psychophile Narratives&quot; of bishop Pavlos Monemvasias, which were written in the 10th century and survive only in an Arabic translation. In one of them, it is mentioned that the Arabs attacked the fortress of &quot;Vukolo&quot;, which has been identified as Monemvasia. 

Earlier in the same text it is mentioned that the relics of the saints of Barcelona—of Bishop Valerius, Eulalia and Vincentius among others—had washed up in the city. The inhabitants collected the sarcophagi that contained them and built a church on the steep hill. Later, after the landing, it is reported that during the reign of Emperors Leo VI and Alexander, the chapel was located and the remains were transferred to the chapel of Agia Irini, next to the church of Agia Anastasia (which today is dedicated to Christ Elkomenos). 

At the beginning of the 10th century, the ecclesiastical seat of Monemvasia was transferred from the jurisdiction of the church of Rome to the patriarchate of Constantinople, where it was demoted to the diocese of Corinth. Despite this, Monemvasia continued to develop, while at the same time maintaining privileges, among which was self-government.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, Monemvasia experienced significant economic growth. During that period, the settlement spread around the island (not only on its main side), and important monuments were rebuilt, such as the church of Hagia Sophia (originally dedicated to Panagia Hodegetria) in the upper town and the church of Elkomenos Christos, which was reconstructed during that period, possibly due to the placement of the image of Christ Elkomenos in the temple. At the time of the Komnenians, Monemvasia had evolved into a guardian of the western entrance to the Aegean. In 1147 ships of the Sicilian king Roger II tried to capture it without success and were forced to withdraw with heavy losses. The archon of Monemvasia during the attack Theodoros Mavrosomis then settled in the imperial court and after the Battle of Myriokephalos, he was put in charge of the left wing of the army and was then given the position of mediator.

The Latin Empire, a 13th-century crusader state, unsuccessfully besieged Monemvasia in 1222. Then, in 1252, after a three-year siege, the Frankish prince of Achaia, William of Villehardouin, occupied Monemvasia. The inhabitants of Monemvasia who did not wish to remain under Latin occupation left for Bithynia, which acquired many of the same commercial privileges as Monemvasia. Monemvasia itself retained the privileges it had, with the only obligation being maintenance of the ships, and became the seat of a Latin bishop. Its loss was a serious blow to the emperor of Nicaea, Michael VIII Palaiologos, as it overturned his plans for the recovery of the lands that had fallen to the Franks.

When William was captured by the Byzantines at the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259 and refused to cede his possessions in the Peloponnese in exchange for his release, Michael held him prisoner until 1262, when he agreed to surrender to the Byzantines the castles of Monemvasia, Mystras, Grand Magne, and Geraki. Monemvasia was designated the seat of a Byzantine general and the seat of an Orthodox metropolitan, while at the same time important privileges were granted to the inhabitants, which were renewed and expanded by Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282-1328), such as exemption from inheritance tax and exemption from commerce (duties). Andronikos III Paleologos then exempted Monemvasia from 28 taxes. The prosperity of the city was rapid: in addition to the increase in population, whose main achievement was trade and shipping, conditions were created for spiritual and ecclesiastical development, to the extent that the period up to 1460 is considered to have been the city&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;. This prosperity attracted Roger of Lauria, who sacked the lower town in 1292. In 1302, the town welcomed the Catalan Company on its way eastward. In 1324, out of a total of 3,108 pyres that the metropolitans contributed to the Constantinople Patriarchate, 800 came from the Monemvasia metropolis, more than any other. In 1347 or 1348, John VI Kantakouzenos promoted the metropolis of Monemvasia to the hierarchy of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The peaceful life of Monemvasia during the 14th and the first half of the 15th century was disturbed by pirate raids and internal conflicts, though they did not, however, affect its historical course under the Despotate of the Morea.

In 1354, control over the Despotate of Morea was usurped by Manuel Kantakouzinos, who remained in power until 1380. The administration of Monemvasia was given to Ioannis Kantakouzinos, who rebelled after learning that after Manuel&#x27;s death, Theodore Palaiologos would be appointed. Theodore tried to approach Monemvasia but was driven away and fled to Venetian-occupied Koroni to ask for help in exchange for the territory of Monemvasia, but the Monemvasians repudiated the rebels. In 1394, Theodore was captured by Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I and, in order to free himself, asked for the surrender of Monemvasia. Theodore managed to escape and with the help of Venice recaptured Monemvasia from the Ottomans in July 1394. The result of all these events was that the city&#x27;s population decreased and commercial traffic was effectively brought to a halt.

After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, unrest prevailed in the Despotate, which at the time had two despots, Thomas Palaiologos and Demetrios Palaiologos, who disagreed about the future of the despotate. Dimitrios surrendered Monemvasia in May 1460 to Mehmed II, but he withdrew without besieging it. Then, following the advice of Thomas, the inhabitants offered the city to Pope Pius II on September 12, 1460, who accepted.

=== First Venetian rule and first Ottoman rule ===
In 1460 Sultan Mehmed II arrived in Corinth, proceeded to Laconia, capturing the fortresses of Achaia and Ilia, and in July 1461, Salmenikos, the last castle of the Greek despot, was surrendered. Thus, apart from the Venetian possessions of the Peloponnese and Monemvasia, which had been granted with the consent of the Despot of Morea Thomas Palaiologos to Pope Pius II, the Ottoman conquest of this critical region for Byzantium was complete. By the end of 1463, Monemvasia had fallen to the Venetians. After the end of the First Ottoman-Venetian War (1463–1479), part of the lands in the territory of Monemvasia came under the possession of the Ottomans, affecting the island&#x27;s agricultural production and trade. Venice&#x27;s possessions around Monemvasia became more limited after the Second Ottoman-Venetian War (1499–1503).

Hayreddin Barbarossa began in 1537 attempts to capture Nafplio and Monemvasia, the two remaining Venetian possessions in the Peloponnese. In the peace treaty, Sultan Suleiman II requested as compensation for the damages suffered by the fleet the concession of islands he has conquered along with Nafplio and Monemvasia, and despite the Venetians&#x27; reactions, the treaty was signed on October 2, 1540, and the two cities surrendered to the Turks. Most of its inhabitants then abandoned it and took refuge in the nearest Venetian-occupied islands, mainly in Corfu and Crete.

During the Ottoman times, the upper town was abandoned. Monemvasia itself became known as &quot;Menexe&quot; (), &quot;Menefse&quot; (), or &quot;Benefse&quot; () in Greek and in Turkish (all meaning &#x27;violet&#x27;). It was administratively included in the Eyalet of the Morea. In the census of 1573-1574, it was mentioned that the town had a garrison of 104 men and paid 28,665 akçes in taxes, 6,000 of which came from the commercial traffic in its port. Due to information that there was a small garrison in Monemvasia, Jean Parisot de La Valette, the Grand Master of the Order of Malta decided to capture it in order to obtain a base in the Aegean. At the end of September 1564, he sent galleys but as the old unguarded path leading to the upper town could not be located, they withdrew. This path was sealed by the Ottomans sometime later with a wall. In 1583 there were 320 non-Muslim families and 191 residents without a family.

During the Cretan War (1645–1669), attempts were made by Venice to capture Monemvasia, which served as a base for the Ottoman army. The first attempt was made in August 1653, in which the Venetians managed to capture a fort outside the lower town, but abandoned the attempt as attacks on the lower town failed. The second attempt was made in July 1655, with the Venetians proceeding to blockade Monemvasia, but as the Ottomans sent reinforcements, they eventually withdrew. Subsequently, the Ottomans strengthened the defense of the island, and granted its inhabitants the possibility to build a church with a dome, as a reward for not ceding the city to the Venetians.

=== Venetian recapture and second Ottoman rule ===
In 1684, the Sixth Ottoman–Venetian War began, during which Francesco Morosini occupied the entire Peloponnese, with the exception of Monemvasia, which resisted. Morosini besieged it again in 1687, bombarding it, but the Turkish defenders refused to surrender and he withdrew. Many Turks who fled from the rest of Moria took refuge in the city. In 1688 he proposed to build a fortress opposite Monemvasia. Finally in July 1689 the construction of two forts began and the siege began again, but it was again unsuccessful and at the end of September it was withdrawn. At the end of the following spring the siege was resumed, led by Girolamo Corner and despite setbacks, the city surrendered and Corner entered on 12 August 1690.

The recovery of the Peloponnese from the Venetians also resulted in the resettlement of residents in Monemvasia, which was designated as the capital of the department of Laconia. The city had suffered significant damage and began a program of reconstruction. Its population in 1700 had reached 1,622 inhabitants, almost double the count of ten years prior.

In 1715, the Ottoman Empire army attacked the Peloponnese, in the context of the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718). The Ottoman fleet arrived at Monemvasia on 3 August 1715, demanding the city&#x27;s surrender. The city&#x27;s council of war asked for a 20-day extension to learn the intentions of the Venetian fleet, which was granted. The fleet did not approach Monemvasia and the city finally surrendered on September 7, 1715. Some of the inhabitants were sold as slaves as part of the surrender treaty. Others fled to other Venetian-occupied areas. After the Ottoman recovery, Monemvasia remained under the jurisdiction of Kapudan Pasha. The area experienced a relative commercial and economic boom and a Greek school was established. Some Venetians returned to the city, as did former Turkish residents.

During the Orlov revolt (1770), the Metropolitan of Monemvasia, Anthimos the Lesvios, armed a body of Monemvasians and blocked the Ottomans in the fortress, but when the besiegers were attacked by the Albanians, they dispersed and many were captured or killed and the city was looted. After the revolt, the area was abandoned by a large part of its population.

=== During the War of Independence ===
During the beginning on March 15, 1821, at the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, the fortress of Monemvasia was besieged by land and sea. After a four-month siege, it was surrendered to the Greeks on July 23, 1821. Disputes over the distribution of spoils and administration ensued, leading to anarchy. 

In March 1822, it was decided by the temporary administration of Greece to repair the fortress and send a guard, but to no avail, the result of which was that the situation in the fortress worsened. Later, the fortress and the province of Monemvasia fell victim to the civil war. The Maniots led by Konstantinos Mavromichalis began to besiege the fortress in September 1823. By March 1824, half the villages of the province had passed into the possession of the Maniots, and while they continued to besiege the fortress, the central administration decided to transfer three to four cannons from Monemvasia to Spetses. Cretans and Psarans arrived at the fortress after the destruction of Psara, but the siege of the fortress continued. 

In January 1827, Dimitris Plapoutas arrived at the fortress with 200 soldiers and the inhabitants and the governors of Monemvasia agreed to hand over the administration of the castle to him so that the fortress could be liberated, as was done by the decision of the National Assembly on 1 March 1827. However, Mavromichalis continued to try to conquer the fortress, as a result of which Plapoutas withdrew, not accepting this behavior, and eventually Mavromichalis was placed in charge of the castle. These constant quarrels prevented Monemvasia from being able to play an important role in the later developments regarding the establishment of the Greek state.

=== Post-Independence ===
According to the 1828 Census, Monemvasia was home to just 659 inhabitants, with most of the houses having been destroyed in the war. Konstantinos Kanaris was appointed as the new guardian of Monemvasia. Among the issues he faced were guarding the fortress and repairing the buildings, as they were not in sufficient shape to house necessary public services. For this reason the engineers Fotis Kesoglou and Theodoros Vallianos arrived in the town. At the same time, an effort was made to operate a school, which was housed in the church of Agios Nikolaos. Despite difficulties in financing it, it remained in operation in 1937. Ecclesiastically, Monemvasia remained the seat of the metropolis of Monemvasia, but after the death of Metropolitan Chrysantho Pagonis, the seat remained unoccupied and Gerasimos Pagonis was appointed as vicar.

Monemvasia continued to be in a dire situation for many more years, but it remained the largest village in the region and during the administrative reorganization of 1833. Monemvasia continued to be the seat of the province, which was renamed from the province of Monemvasia to the province of Epidaurus Limiras. Monemvasia remained the seat of the province until 1864, when the seat was transferred to Molaoi, but it remained the seat of a municipality, until its abolition in 1913. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was the seat of a court of justice, customs office, telegraph office, police, and school authority. According to the censuses, there was a population decline until the 1970s. The community&#x27;s population trend according to the censuses is as follows: 1920: 483, 1928: 638, 1940: 638, 1951: 522, 1961: 487, 1971: 445. Generally, the inhabitants of Monemvasia either immigrated to Athens or moved to Gefyra, opposite Monemvasia. In the 1951 census, of the community&#x27;s 522 residents, 261 lived in Gefyra, 178 in the old town, and 83 in Agia Kyriaki. The population of the old town continued to decline, and in 1971 only 32 residents lived in it. Monemvasia continued to rely on cisterns for its water supply until 1964 and electricity arrived in 1972. Trade was carried out by coastal shipping, where products were transported to the nearest major port, Piraeus.

===Recent years===
From the 1970s, Monemvasia began to flourish again, this time as a tourist destination. The people of Monemvasia sold their houses to people visiting Monemvasia, who restored them. Alexandros and Harris Kalliga played a key role in the restorations. At the same time, Gefyra also experienced strong growth (in the 2011 census it has 1,299 inhabitants).

In 1971, Monemvasia became linked with the rest of the outside world through a bridge on the western side that connects to GR-86.

In more recent history, the town has seen a resurgence in importance with increasing numbers of tourists visiting the site and the region. The medieval buildings have been restored, and many of them converted to hotels.

For the past few years, on July 23, an independence day celebration has been held in the main port. Speeches are made and the story of Tzannetakis Grigorakis, and his men, is recounted in both Greek and English. Inhabitants and visitors can gather to watch as a ship, built every year, is filled with pyrotechnics and set on fire.

The 1986 horror movie &quot;The Wind&quot; was filmed here.

==Municipality==
The municipality of Monemvasia was formed from the former province of Epidavros Limira during the 2011 administrative reform as a part of the Kallikratis Programme. It was formed through the merger of the following 5 former municipalities, which thereby became municipal units:
* Asopos
* Molaoi
* Monemvasia
* Voies
* Zarakas

The municipality has an area of , the municipal unit an area of .

==Historical population==
== Malvasia Wine ==

Monemvasia&#x27;s trade in wine was so extensive throughout its history, especially under Venetian administration, that the name of the place became familiar throughout Europe in connotation with the variety of wine called &quot;Malvasia&quot;, &#x27;Malmsey&#x27; in English. Though the wine was associated with Monemvasia through trade, it was not grown locally, rather coming for the most part from the Peloponnese region and islands in the Cyclades, especially Tinos. The variety of grape is believed by most ampelographers, however, to originate from Crete.

== Outline of town ==

Monemvasia consists of the upper town, which is located on the plateau of the hill, and the lower town, which is built on the southern coast of the peninsula. The upper town is no longer inhabited, as it was abandoned after the second Venetian occupation. The entrance to the upper town today is through a fortified gate to which a winding path ascends from the lower town. A second entrance used to be on the north side, but was sealed during the first occupation by the Ottoman Empire. In the upper town was the acropolis of Monemvasia, a rectangular fortress with four towers, which was built in the 6th century, houses and public buildings, such as churches, cisterns and administrative buildings. The church of Hagia Sophia stands out among them. The layout of the settlement is no longer distinct.

The lower town is located under the southern wall of the upper town. It is walled on three sides: east, south, and west. Entry is through the west gate, which is connected by a road to the bridge over the causeway. The street continues inside the city and forms the main street of the lower town, which was known as the Middle Street (&quot;Μέση Οδός&quot;) in the Byzantine period. The area surrounding it was known as the &quot;Agora&quot; and along it are shops. This road intersects with the road that descends from the upper town and leads to the gate in the sea walls known as the &quot;portello&quot; (). At the point where these two roads cross is Elekmenos Christos square, where the metropolitan church, the former mosque, and the episcopal palace—official residence of the bishop—are located. In the 19th century, two more squares were created, the &quot;Megali&quot; () and &quot;Mikri Tapia&quot; (). The rest of the streets of the lower town are narrow cobblestones, sometimes covered with vaulted structures known as , over which sections of houses were built.

=== Fortifications ===

At the highest point of the rock of Monemvasia was the acropolis. This fortress consisted of an enclosure with four towers at each corner. Entrance was made through a gate in the eastern wall. The walls were made of &#x27;mudstone&#x27; with a fortified mortar. In the place of the southwestern tower, a rectangular powder magazine was built during the second Venetian period. Remains of buildings are preserved inside the fort. One of the buildings near the center had a cistern. There are indications that on the eastern side of the fort there was a large hall, on the southern wall of which the monogram of Theodore Palaiologos was found. The fortress seems to have been abandoned during the first Venetian rule.

The rest of the upper town is protected by a fortified enclosure on the north and south sides of the hill, while the other sides were not fortified as they were steep and thus naturally fortified. A road with parapets in places, which had battlements and lookouts, was built around the cliff to avoid the risk of falling. The fortification of the upper town is known as () and was built during the Byzantine period, although now the greater part of the walls date from the Venetian and Ottoman times. The walls are more reinforced in the section where the south gate is located, in the section above the west gate of the lower town and at the eastern end. To the gate of the upper town leads from the lower town a winding cobblestone with two intermediate gates. The gate in Byzantine times was vaulted and had a square tower above it. 

During Ottoman times, vaulted rooms were built near the gate, one of which was a mosque. To the west there is a small bastion. The western wall of the upper town oversaw the main gate of the lower town. It had two towers. This wall was strengthened by the Ottomans so that it could face the artillery with a double bastion to the east. On the eastern edge of the north wall there was also a fort, which was rebuilt in 1540 by Kasım Pasha, but was destroyed when his gunpowder magazine exploded after being bombarded by the Venetians. The castle also had a gate on the north wall, but this was sealed during the 1st Ottoman Empire with a wall which the Venetians called (&#x27;Red Wall&#x27;). The Venetians strengthened it and placed cannons in it.

The lower town is walled to the west, south and east. To the west is the main gate of the town, which leads to the bridge and the harbor. During Byzantine times it must have been incorporated into a tower and protected by additional towers, one of which survives to this day, incorporated in later alterations. A straight wall () connected tower to tower at the base of the cliff, and another reached to the sea, where there was a corner tower. The south-west corner of the wall was strengthened in the 17th century with a cannon tower, while the gate was rebuilt and a bastion built over it. Another bastion was built near the rock. After the recapture by Venice, a strong tower was built in the southwest corner. The sea wall consists of straight sections which connected five towers beyond the two corner towers. In the middle of the wall was a gate. In the 17th century it was strengthened, as a sloping wall and a small bastion were built. The eastern wall resembles the western, with straight sections between towers. It has a gate in the middle that leads out of the town. To strengthen the western wall, the Ottomans also built a fortress outside the walls with many cannons.

=== Churches ===

* The Church of Hagia Sophia () in the upper town, near the edge of the cliff. The church dates from Byzantine times, and was built according to the prevailing Byzantine architecture of the 12th century. It is an built according to the cross-in-square structure. It has been identified with the temple of &quot;Odigetria&quot; mentioned in various sources. The main temple measures 14 by 14 meters and the dome is 7 meters in diameter and has 16 windows. The narthex measures two stories. The temple had rich sculptural decoration. Parts of frescoes have been preserved, such as two archangels in the narthex, a scene from the life of Saint Nicholas in the northern chancel, and a depiction of Christ as the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in the sanctuary. After the completion of the temple, a double portico was added to the south façade externally, while during the Venetian times a two-story external gallery was added to the west façade. During the first Ottoman rule, the temple was turned into a mosque and the frescoes were whitewashed. Restoration works of the temple took place in 1958, with the restoration of Byzantine elements, but some of the architectural members had been modified to such an extent that they could not be used and thus were transferred to the archaeological collection.
* The Church of Christos Elkomenos () in the central square of the lower town is the metropolitan church of Monemvasia. Today the church has the form of a three-aisled basilica with a dome. The middle nave is raised and separated from the other two by pillars. The belfry is separate from the temple, northwest of it. The church was originally built in the 6th century AD and has since undergone a series of modifications. The central arch is semi-circular and has an internal synthronon, which suggests that the temple dates from the early Christian era. A second phase of construction took place during the 11th-12th centuries, as can be seen from the sculptures above the temple door. In 1538, according to an inscription, construction work was carried out, while an inscription above the west door states that work was completed in 1697, which probably related to the construction of the dome and the narthex. The temple does not appear to have been wall-painted. Inside it were kept icons, such as the icon of Elkomenos that was brought to Constantinople by Isaac II Angelos in the 12th century; the icon of the Crucifixion of Christ, from the 14th century, which is exhibited in the Byzantine Museum; and several post-Byzantine icons.
* Panagia Myrtidiotissa () or Panagia Kritikia () was built north of the temple of Elkomenos during the second Venetian period, in a district where Cretans settled. It is a one-room basilica with a dome. It has a large central arch. The façade and the dome are built of ashlar and the rest of the temple of mudstone. The façade features decorative elements with Italianate influences, such as the round skylight and cornices and decorated pediments with geometric and floral motifs. 
* Panagia Chrysafitissa () is located near the sea wall and Chrysafitissa square. It has a large dome and a narrow narthex on the western façade. The temple was built during the first Ottoman occupation and has Islamic influences. The temple is plastered inside. 
* The Church of Agios Nikolaos () is located northeast of Panagia Chrysafitissa. It is a three-aisled basilica with a dome, with aisles separated by pillars. On the western façade there is an inscription which states that the temple was built by Andrea Licinio in 1703. Both the decoration and the construction have Western European influences.
* The Church of Agios Spyridon () is two-aisled and dates from the second Venetian period. It is located below the upper city gate.
* The Church of Agios Antonios (), northeast of the church of Elkomenos, dates from Byzantine times, but its current form dates from the second Venetian period. It is a single-bay vaulted temple with two blind apses preserved on the north wall. The church&#x27;s worn frescoes, such as a hierarch and two saints holding a cross in the northwest apse, date from the late 13th or 14th century.
* The Church of Agia Paraskevi () is a small chapel on the northwest side of the church of Elkomenos. It is single room and vaulted.
* The Church of the Holy Apostles (), a small cave church with traces of frescoes from the second Venetian period. 
* The double-aisled Church of Saints Demetrius and Anthony (), of the second Venetian period. 
* Hagia Anna the Catholic () a small one-room church on the main street of the lower town. It has a peculiar space on its northern side. Based on its characteristics, it was built in the second Venetian period.
* Hagia Anna of Malta () is a three-aisled basilica of the 2nd Venetian period, whose eastern side has deteriorated.
* Also preserved in Monemvasia are the ruined churches of &quot;Hagia Anna&quot;, &quot;Hagioi Tessarakontos&quot;, &quot;Hagios Ioannis,&quot; and &quot;Panagia&quot; (with traces of frescoes), &quot;Evangelistrias&quot;, &quot;Katichoumenon&quot; and a small single-aisled Middle Byzantine church with a sculpted marble iconostasis that was discovered near the sea walls in 1974.

=== Other religious buildings ===

The Mosque of Monemvasia was erected in the square of Elkomenos during the first Ottoman occupation. After the recovery of Monemvasia by the Venetians in 1690, the building changed its use and was probably used by the Capuchins as a monastery. In 1715, when the Ottomans recaptured Monemvasia, the building became a mosque again. After the Revolution of 1821, the building was turned into a prison and later, in the middle of the 20th century, it functioned as a café. Since 1999, it has housed the archaeological collection of Monemvasia. The building is structurally simple, consisting of two halls, a square hall with a lowered dome and a rectangular space. The former mihrab and minaret no longer exist. The entrance is from the eastern façade, where there are two doors but only the northern one is used. Sealed openings can also be seen, such as a Venetian portico on the north façade. The walls are made of rough stone construction and hewn ashlar stones are used in the openings and some architectural details.

South of the church of Elkomenos, the old episcopal palace (bishop&#x27;s residence) is preserved. Above its entrance, a lion relief survives, which is the symbol of Venice.

=== Archaeological collection ===

The archaeological collection of Monemvasia was inaugurated in July 1999 and is housed in the former Ottoman mosque, located in Elkomenos square. The collection includes finds from the excavations and restorations that took place in Monemvasia. The exhibits are exhibited in the vaulted hall on the ground floor of the building, measuring , which is separated from the entrance by a wall. The original floor has been covered with ceramic tiles to protect it. Most of the exhibits are architectural sculptures from the early Christian, Byzantine and post-Byzantine periods and ceramic objects of daily use, while there are also a small number of coins, lamps and glass objects. Among the sculptures stand out those from the church of Hagia Sophia and the restored marble iconostasis of a small church from the Middle Byzantine period that was excavated on a private plot near the sea walls.  Other exhibits include Venetian-era coats of arms and cisterns.

=== Houses ===

The lower city of Monemvasia is, like other Byzantine castle-cities, densely built. Most houses have a narrow façade and are arranged perpendicular to the slopes of the land. These houses generally have three levels. The lower level has an independent entrance and was intended for the stable of animals and had a cistern in a separate area, where the rainwater was collected. Cisterns and reservoirs were necessary as there are no natural water sources in Monemvasia. Above are utility rooms, such as the galley and, occasionally, the bath and fireplace. There was also in this area the mouth of the cistern, through which the water was collected. Access to the upper level was by a small wooden ladder fixed to a stone base. The family stayed in this space and it had many windows.  Although the houses may vary typologically, the three-level layout is common to all.

Houses may have large chimneys and curved cornices formed by roof gutters that lead water to the cistern. Other decorative elements are pilasters and incised crowns. The walls of the houses are made of mudstone and mortar and the outside is plastered to withstand the weather conditions. Other architectural elements such as doorways, chimneys and corner stones are made of ashlar. For the floors, they can be made of &quot;kourasani&quot; (κουρασάνι), a &quot;high quality lime mortar which also includes brick dust and natural pozzolana&quot;, slates, marble, and tiles, while the floors are made of wood. Wood is also used in interior walls, roofs and frames, but its use is generally limited due to its limited availability.

Due to the lack of space within the castle, there were no cultivated lands and gardens. The French naturalist and military officer Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent visited Monemvasia in 1829 and noted that houses may have small walled gardens with only one almond tree inside.

=== Other buildings ===
Due to the absence of natural water sources, Monemvasia has public cisterns. Three large public reservoirs are located in the western part of the upper town, where it was more sparsely populated and more protected than the lower town in case of siege. These cisterns are semi-underground, built long and narrow and are coated internally with &quot;kourasani&quot; so that they are watertight up to the point where the dome begins. In the lower city there are two underground cisterns whose mouths are now in squares, but it is not clear whether they were public cisterns or private cisterns.

In the upper town, near the reservoirs, an Ottoman fountain is preserved. The fountain is four-sided and covered with a dome. It is likely that its water came from the reservoirs. Additionally, in the upper city, near the church of Hagia Sophia, there is a ruined 17th century bathhouse, of which the small dome and cisterns have been preserved. In the lower town, south of the central square, a bathhouse of the first Ottoman occupation is preserved, in the place of the sanctuary of the Byzantine church of Sotiros.

At the eastern end of the island is a modern lighthouse. The lighthouse was built in 1896 and began operation in 1897. Its focal height is above sea level and its beam reaches 11 nautical miles. Next to the lighthouse tower, high, is the lighthouse keeper&#x27;s stone residence. A marble staircase leads to the lighthouse cage. Restoration work on the lighthouse was completed in December 2015. It has a small exhibition about the Greek network of lighthouses.

==Geography==
The rock of Monemvasia was separated from the rest of the mainland by an earthquake in 375 AD leaving only a narrow tombolo connecting the two. The majority of the rock&#x27;s area is a plateau about above sea level, and the town of the same name is built on the slope to the south-east of the rock, overlooking Palaia Monemvasia bay. Many of the streets are narrow and fit only for pedestrian and donkey traffic. A small hamlet of about ten houses lies to the northwest.

===Climate===
Monemvasia has a very hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with mild winters and very hot summers. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 26 June 2007 and the lowest on 17 February 2008. The World Meteorological Organization station of the National Observatory of Athens is located in mainland Greece, just off the tied island of Monemvasia. Monemvasia falls in 11a plant hardiness zone and is the only area in mainland Greece that belongs to 11a zone.

On 27 June 2007 Monemvasia registered a staggering 24 hours minimum temperature of 35.9 °C which is the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in mainland Greece. During that night Monemvasia did not drop below 36.3 °C.
 Monemvasia has never recorded a temperature below 1.5 °C in its entire recorded meteorological history. Moreover, Monemvasia records 133 tropical nights per year which is unique for a location in mainland Europe. Monemvasia has never recorded snow accumulation the past 80 years.

<doc id="415584" wikidata="Q255115" url="?curid=415584" title="Helen Herron Taft">
<text>Helen Louise Taft (née Herron; June 2, 1861 – May 22, 1943) was the First Lady of the United States from 1909 to 1913 as the wife of President William Howard Taft. Born to a politically well-connected Ohio family, she took an early interest in political life, deciding at the age of 17 that she wished to become first lady. Herron married Taft in 1886, and she guided him throughout his political career, encouraging him to take actions that would bring him closer to the presidency. Accompanying her husband to the Philippines in 1900, she became a prominent socialite in Manila, contributing to US-Philippines relations. After her husband was appointed Secretary of War, she played a significant role in convincing him to run for president in the 1908 presidential election and making the necessary connections to ensure his success.

As first lady, Taft was closely involved in the political aspects of the presidency, regularly sitting in on meetings and serving as her husband&#x27;s closest advisor. She held a strong influence over the president&#x27;s decisions, expressing her concerns when she disagreed with him and providing her input on presidential appointments. She also carried out a reorganization of the White House staff and decor. Inspired by her experience in the Philippines, she converted the White House lawn and the West Potomac Park into social hubs with regular live shows and events. Her decision to plant cherry trees in the park proved to be a success, creating a popular tourist attraction. Taft&#x27;s influence as first lady was cut short by a stroke two months into her tenure, permanently limiting her mobility and leaving her absent for a year while she partially recovered.

Though President Taft was relieved that his term had ended, Helen Taft was upset by his defeat for reelection. She remained active after leaving the White House, supporting the Red Cross during World War I and participating in activities for the Colonial Dames of America. She was widowed in 1930, and she was buried beside her husband in Arlington National Cemetery after her death in 1943.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Helen Herron was born on June 2, 1861, in Cincinnati as the fourth of eleven children, the daughter of Harriet Collins Herron and lawyer John Williamson Herron. Throughout her life, she went by &quot;Nellie&quot;. Her father was an associate of two future presidents: he was a college classmate of Benjamin Harrison and a law partner of Rutherford B. Hayes, while her mother was the daughter and the sister of U.S. congressmen. Growing up around politics, Herron developed a love for campaigning. She was also musically inclined as a child, eventually becoming proficient in the piano.

Herron&#x27;s many siblings, eight of whom survived to adulthood, made life complicated for her family, causing her to develop a personal insecurity and distance herself from her family. As a teenager, Herron would rebel against the societal expectations for upper class women; by the age of 15 she had secretly begun smoking cigarettes, drinking whiskey, and gambling. Seeking a channel for her ambition and independence, she enrolled in Cincinnati&#x27;s prestigious Miss Nourse School for Girls where she was educated in many subjects, including several languages. She then attended Miami University, and she also briefly attended the University of Cincinnati.

Herron took an interest in law when she was young, often reading her father&#x27;s legal books at his law office. In 1877, she accompanied her parents when they visited President Hayes and stayed for several weeks at the White House. Her younger sister Lucy Hayes Herron was baptized at that event and named for Mrs. Hayes. This visit instilled in Herron a strong desire to return to the White House as first lady, one that she would often present to her eventual husband.

=== Early career and courtship ===
Herron long wished to leave Ohio, feeling that the region offered her little opportunity. She did not consider marriage to be a viable option, believing that matrimony should not be a woman&#x27;s goal. As a young adult, she worked for her father in his law office. Her debut took place at this time, which she enjoyed despite considering her social obligations to be frivolous. Herron lamented her lack of career options as a woman, eventually taking up teaching as it was the only available career for which she was qualified. She taught French at a private school in Walnut Hills, Ohio for two years beginning in 1881, but she found it unpleasant. She wished to write or perform music, though neither developed into a career for her.

Herron first met William Howard Taft at a sledding party in 1880, though the Herron family and the Taft family were familiar with one another. They would go on to perform together as part of the community theater company. In 1884, Herron founded a salon to discuss intellectual topics each Sunday afternoon with other people of her age. Among the people she invited were Taft and his brother Horace. Taft courted Herron, accompanying her to dances and sending her letters and flowers. Self-doubt caused Herron to avoid commitment to Taft, fearing that he did not truly care for her or value her opinions. Taft proposed to her multiple times, and she eventually accepted in June 1885, though she asked that he keep the engagement secret.

==Marriage and family==
=== Marriage ===

Herron married Taft on June 19, 1886. They went on a honeymoon in Europe, spending three months in England before visiting Germany and Italy. She managed the budget on their vacation, limiting their spending to five dollars per day. After returning, her husband borrowed money to have a home built for them in Walnut Hills, and they lived with his parents until it was complete.

As a couple, they shared not only an emotional companionship but an intellectual one, and they held high regard for each other&#x27;s ideas. Her husband would welcome her opinion when she thought he was in error, describing her as his &quot;best critic&quot;, and she would sometimes mother him. He generally took her advice, though she failed in her attempts to convince him to live a healthier lifestyle and better control his weight. Taft&#x27;s husband considered Taft to be the politician of the family, and early in their marriage he expected her to develop a political career that would outpace his own. She managed the finances of the Taft household, and she encouraged her husband&#x27;s political career, pushing him toward the executive branch rather than his preferred career in the judiciary.

Taft worried about their political future when her husband accepted a five-year term on the Cincinnati Superior Court in 1888, but she was optimistic after he was appointed Solicitor General of the United States in 1890, a position which she had helped him in obtaining through her acquaintance with President Harrison. She saw their move to Washington, D.C., as an opportunity to escape Cincinnati, where she had felt confined, and she hoped that her husband would build connections in Washington politics. She assisted her husband in his presentation in this role, instructing him in oration to better plead cases. She also became a popular socialite in the city and regularly attended Congressional proceedings, both of which allowed her to build political connections. Among her closest friends in Washington were the family of Attorney General William H. H. Miller and the wives of the Supreme Court justices.

They returned to Cincinnati in 1892 when Taft&#x27;s husband was appointed as a judge on the federal circuit. He enjoyed this position, but Taft again feared that it would stifle his ambition and that he would progress no further. While her husband served on the bench, Taft raised their three children: Robert, born 1889; Helen, born 1891; and Charles, born 1897. She helped found a hospital at this time, and she founded the Cincinnati Orchestra Association, serving as its president. She lamented the lack of excitement in Cincinnati, with her only respite being a vacation home in Murray Bay, Quebec.

=== Life in the Philippines ===

Taft&#x27;s husband was sent to help establish a government in the Philippines in 1900, as Spain had transferred the Philippines to the United States the previous year. Though neither of them knew what the job would entail, Taft encouraged him to accept the position. She relished this opportunity for travel and excitement, stopping in Hawaii and Japan while her husband went on to the Philippines. She also believed that the position would move him closer to the presidency. After Taft arrived in the Philippines, she sought to win the approval of the Filipino people and respect the culture of the Philippines by learning the language, wearing a native Filipino costume, and inviting Filipinos to social events. Taft&#x27;s treatment of the Filipino people contributed to improved relations with the country, including her work to end the system of racial segregation that had previously been in place.

Taft traveled extensively throughout the Philippines, learning how to ride a horse in order to do so. She also accompanied her husband when he traveled to China, Japan, and Hong Kong on official duties. She considered her primary responsibility in the country to be the hosting of gala events, where she would mingle with the Filipino people. Her husband became Governor-General of the Philippines on July 4, 1901, and the Tafts moved into the Malacañang Palace in Manila. While in the Philippines, Taft organized a nutritional program that provided milk for Filipino children. When she wrote her autobiography years later, the majority of her writing addressed her years in the Philippines, overshadowing even her time in the White House.

The Tafts took leave from the Philippines and began a voyage to return home on December 24, 1901. The winter was difficult for Taft, as she was exhausted from the constant stress of her role in the Philippines, compounded by her husband needing two surgeries, and both of her parents suffering from strokes, her mother&#x27;s proving fatal. Taft accompanied her husband on a trip to Italy in 1902, where she was treated as a guest of honor and was personally received by Pope Leo XIII. She returned to Philippines in September 1902. When President Theodore Roosevelt offered Taft&#x27;s husband the position of Secretary of War in 1904, Taft convinced him to accept, and the Tafts returned to Washington, D.C.

=== Cabinet member&#x27;s wife ===
Taft became a cabinet member&#x27;s wife when her husband became Secretary of War. In this role, she was expected to call upon and receive other cabinet members&#x27; wives in Washington. She considered the position to be a downgrade from her time in the Philippines, where she had grown accustomed to being the wife of the region&#x27;s chief executive. This also required her to be in regular contact with first lady Edith Roosevelt, with whom she developed a strong rivalry. At the same time, Taft&#x27;s husband developed a close political and personal friendship with President Roosevelt: a relationship that Taft encouraged and helped facilitate. His work in the Department of War did allow for more travel, providing Taft with a chance to learn more of international politics and make connections abroad. The couple traveled together to Panama and Japan, and she also took their children on a vacation to England while her husband stayed behind.

Taft&#x27;s husband&#x27;s career came to a crossroads in 1906 when President Roosevelt considered nominating him for a position on the Supreme Court, while at the same time momentum grew for a William Howard Taft presidency. Taft was vehemently opposed to her husband taking such a position, fearing it would end any further political aspirations. She personally met with Roosevelt and discouraged him from nominating her husband in a half hour discussion. Taft had spoken to the president on several occasions, earning his trust to improve her husband&#x27;s position in the Roosevelt administration. This would eventually contribute to Roosevelt&#x27;s support of a William Howard Taft presidency, and Roosevelt would even strategize politically with Taft rather than with her husband as the 1908 presidential election approached.

By 1907, Taft&#x27;s husband was considered to be a potential candidate for the presidency, and the Tafts traveled across the country in a speaking tour. Taft found the experience more intensive than she had expected, and she was deeply embarrassed by one incident in which she lost track of the week and she was seen playing cards with her husband on the Lord&#x27;s Day. Afterward, they returned to the Philippines and took a trip to other countries. Upon returning to the United States, Taft declined to join her husband in campaigning. She did advise him during his campaign, however, and she closely followed news coverage of the race so that she would be aware of the criticisms against him. She also advised him as to how his decisions as Secretary of War would affect public opinion.

==First Lady of the United States==

=== Entering the White House ===

Taft considered it a personal victory when her husband was elected president in 1908, as she had guided him toward the office. She eagerly planned for the upcoming inauguration and her term as first lady, including how she would manage the White House. She also had her inaugural dress sent to the Philippines so that it could be embroidered there. President Roosevelt was unavailable on the day of President Taft&#x27;s inauguration [disputed - discuss], so Taft determined that she would ride to the White House with her husband in Roosevelt&#x27;s place, becoming the first presidential wife to do so.

Upon entering the White House, Taft had the White House redecorated, and she removed the trophy heads that Theodore Roosevelt had mounted on the walls. She made several other decorative changes, taking inspiration from Eastern cultures and using flowers from the White House greenhouse. She had twin beds put into the White House for the first time, and she made accommodations for the White House silver collection by installing a vault and a silver cleaner. She also made staff changes, replacing the ushers with footmen and the steward with a housekeeper. Taft was strict about cleanliness and presentation in the White House, and her decorative talents were celebrated by contemporary journalists.

In May 1909, shortly after her husband&#x27;s term began, Taft suffered a stroke, impairing her speech and limiting movement in right arm and leg. She left Washington to recover, causing newspapers to report that she had suffered a nervous breakdown. Over the following year, Taft was forced to relearn how to speak. She took a less active role after her stroke, but she remained involved in White House affairs. Though her condition improved over time, she would never fully recover. The nature of her stroke was not disclosed to the press, following a long-standing precedent of the press not inquiring about the first lady&#x27;s private life.

=== Hostess and socialite ===

Taft had grown accustomed to the royal style of treatment that she had experienced in the Philippines, and she wished to establish a similar regal environment as White House hostess. She sought to improve the social traditions associated with the White House while she was first lady; she changed the locations of events to make them more efficient, and she introduced dancing at formal receptions. She made extensive use of the White House lawn, hosting garden parties, theatrical shows, and music performances. In the time that she was recovering from her stroke in 1909, Taft took a less active role in organizing events, having her sisters and her daughter supporting her in the duties of White House hostess. She resumed her responsibilities in 1910, and she had returned to an active schedule by 1911. Taft hosted many parties and social events, but the social highlight of her tenure was the Tafts&#x27; silver wedding anniversary gala on June 19, 1911, for nearly 5,000 guests. Another 15,000 observers crowded outside of the White House.

Taft exerted some level of autonomy while she served as first lady. She declined to participate in luncheons with the wives of cabinet members, feeling that they were of little consequence and simply a means of putting her aside as a woman. Instead, she observed presidential meetings and closely managed the organization of the White House. She felt that the presidential salary of $75,000 was well above what they needed, she reduced their spending to $50,000 per year, accumulating a savings of $100,000 by the end of her husband&#x27;s term. Among her cost-saving practices were the purchase of foods wholesale and the care of a cow on White House grounds to provide milk and butter. The presence of the cow was poorly received.

As first lady, Taft received guests three afternoons a week in the Red Room. She introduced musical entertainment after state dinners which became a White House tradition. The Tafts attended symphony, opera, and theater performances in Washington, D.C.; she started another summer tradition at West Potomac Park with the United States Marine Band playing for the public. One major undertaking of Taft&#x27;s tenure as first lady was the transformation of the West Potomac Park into an esplanade. Inspired by Luneta Park in Manila, she had a bandstand constructed and organized weekly concerts. She also arranged for the planting of Japanese cherry trees, accepting a donation of trees from the mayor of Tokyo, who was a friend of the Tafts. The Potomac cherry trees would continue to be a popular tourist attraction, particularly during their blooming.

Prohibition was a major political issue while the Tafts lived in the White House. Taft opposed the Prohibition movement, and she served alcohol to White House guests against the wishes of the president. Unlike most other first ladies, Taft would visit the White House kitchens and oversee the preparation of food. In particular, she would observe the preparation of one of her specialty dishes, turtle soup. As first lady, Taft also saw to the replacement of horse and buggy with the first presidential automobile fleet. She was open with the press, and she broke precedent by actively participating in media interviews. She particularly engaged with women journalists to support their work and earn their support. In 1912, she donated her inauguration gown to the National Museum of American History to begin the First Ladies&#x27; Gown display, one of the Smithsonian’s most popular exhibits.

=== Political influence ===

Taft took an interest in everything relating to her husband&#x27;s presidency, and she maintained her own opinions on important matters. Though she did not believe that women should be &quot;meddling&quot; in politics, she spoke publicly on her beliefs, even when they contradicted the positions of her husband. She managed his appearance and scheduling to ensure he maintained proper presentation, and she would provide him with political information such as names and statistics as he needed them. She would also stay near him to prevent his narcolepsy from affecting his responsibilities.

Taft also influenced appointments during her husband&#x27;s presidency, providing her thoughts on the character of his nominees. She convinced her husband to recall ambassador Henry White because of a long-standing grudge that she held against him. She also rejected the appointment of Nicholas Longworth as a diplomat because he was married to Alice Roosevelt Longworth, whom she disliked. This latter action is cited as one of the reasons that Presidents Roosevelt and Taft began to oppose one another during the Taft presidency.

Though Taft did not identify as a feminist, she supported women&#x27;s rights and used her position to advance the cause, convincing her husband to appoint women in government. In 1912, she attended a House Rules committee inquiry to hear testimonies of police brutality against women, bringing awareness to the issue. She also supported the rights of African Americans and other marginalized groups, believing that they were hampered by a lack of opportunity. She was active in other causes, such as safe workplace conditions, throughout her tenure as first lady. Her stroke at the beginning of her tenure prevented her from further political activity, a fact that she regretted. Her husband recognized her influence in White House politics, considering the accomplishments of his presidency to be hers as well. She also spoke openly about her own influence on the presidency, prompting criticism from her husband&#x27;s political opponents.

Taft was the first first lady to visit the American judiciary. In 1911, she visited the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the arguments of &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;. She also asked to observe the inauguration of new Supreme Court justices, becoming the first woman to ever sit in the bar of the court. In June 1912, she attended both the Republican National Convention that re-nominated her husband and the Democratic National Convention that nominated his opponent Woodrow Wilson. She took a front-row seat at the latter in order to deter speakers&#x27; criticism of her husband. Though her husband disliked the presidency, Taft was saddened when her husband lost reelection to Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential election, and she left the White House reluctantly.

== Later life and death ==

After leaving the White House, the Tafts moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where Taft&#x27;s husband held a chair at Yale University. Taft was unhappy with life outside of the White House, and she was often alone when her husband was traveling and her children were away at school. She was, however, happy to be out of the public eye. In 1914, Taft became the first first lady to publish a memoir with the publication of &quot;Recollections of Full Years&quot;, which had been written with her daughter Helen and journalist Eleanor Egan. She took an interest in the events of World War I, and during the war she provided support for the American Red Cross.

The Tafts continued to travel after retiring from the White House, visiting Bermuda, Panama, England, and Italy, being greeted in the latter two countries by King George V and the Pope, respectively. Continuing in her interest in politics, Taft joined the Colonial Dames of America in 1923 and became its honorary vice president in 1925.She also served as the honorary leader of the Girl Scouts of the USA.

After her husband&#x27;s death in March 1930, she lived with her housekeeper in Washington, D.C., occasionally traveling to other countries. She continued to follow politics later in life, opposing the New Deal policies that were implemented in the 1930s. Taft died in Washington on May 22, 1943, and was buried next to her husband at Arlington National Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
Taft was one of the earliest first ladies to become directly involved in the political career of her husband. Her influence in presidential politics was not given significant attention by historians after her death in 1943, and like other first ladies, her influence was not closely examined by historians until the 1980s. Before this, she was most well known for her introduction of cherry trees in the West Potomac Park. The first biography about Taft was written in 2005 by Carl Sferrazza Anthony, who argued that she was her husband&#x27;s closest advisor and that she saw herself as responsible for the presidency as her husband. Her role as a mentor and guide to her husband was recognized by contemporary journalists and has since become a defining aspect of her legacy. She is recognized for her role in developing her husband&#x27;s political career and bringing about the presidency of William Howard Taft.

<doc id="415586" wikidata="Q237590" url="?curid=415586" title="Edith Roosevelt">
<text>Edith Kermit Roosevelt ( Carow; August 6, 1861 – September 30, 1948) was the second wife of President Theodore Roosevelt and the first lady of the United States from 1901 to 1909. She had previously been the second lady of the United States in 1901 and the first lady of New York from 1899 to 1900.

Edith Carow grew up alongside the Roosevelt family and married Theodore Roosevelt in 1886. They established a home in Sagamore Hill, where Edith had five children with Theodore, and they moved back and forth between New York and Washington, D.C., as Theodore&#x27;s political career progressed over the following years. Edith became a public figure when her husband became a war hero in the Spanish–American War and was elected governor of New York. Theodore became vice president in March 1901, and she became second lady of the United States for six months; she became first lady when the assassination of President William McKinley propelled Theodore to the presidency in September of that year.

The exact nature of Edith&#x27;s influence over Theodore&#x27;s presidency is unknown, but they frequently spoke about politics and he often took her advice. She resented the press, feeling that it was intrusive. She leveraged her influence to control when and how they reported on the Roosevelts, and had professional photographs taken of the family so the press would not need to take their own. Edith also controlled Washington social life, organizing weekly meetings of the cabinet members&#x27; wives, and became the gatekeeper of who could attend formal events. Her oversight of the 1902 White House renovations and her hiring of the first social secretary for a first lady, Belle Hagner, are described by historians as her most enduring legacies.

Edith took up travel in the years after leaving the White House, frequently touring Europe and Latin America. Her health declined in the 1910s, and she was devastated by the deaths of her son Quentin in 1918 and then Theodore in 1919. She remained politically active, supporting Warren G. Harding in 1920 and Herbert Hoover in 1932. Edith took an interest in her ancestry in the 1920s, writing a book on her ancestors and purchasing her ancestral home in Brooklyn, Connecticut. She lost two more of her sons in the 1940s and was bedridden for the last year of her life. Edith died on September 30, 1948. Historians have consistently ranked her in the upper half of first ladies in periodic polling by the Siena College Research Institute.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
Edith Kermit Carow was born on August 6, 1861, in Norwich, Connecticut. She was the first of two daughters born to Charles Carow and Gertrude Elizabeth Tyler. Though her family was wealthy, her father was an unsuccessful businessman as well as a chronic gambler and an alcoholic, while her mother was a hypochondriac. For much of her childhood, the family was forced to move in with various relatives. She was unhappy with her childhood, and she rarely spoke of her parents throughout her adult life.

The Carows were close friends with their neighbors, the Roosevelt family. Edith&#x27;s early schooling took place at the Roosevelt home, as well as the Dodsworth School where she received etiquette instruction. Corinne Roosevelt was Edith&#x27;s closest childhood friend, and Edith was often brought along with the Roosevelt children in their family activities. At age four, she stood with the Roosevelts on their balcony to watch Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral procession. Edith and Corinne formed their own literature club as children, the &quot;Party of Renowned Eligibles&quot;, in which Edith served as club secretary each week for three years. She also bonded with Corinne&#x27;s brother, Theodore Roosevelt, over their mutual love of literature. The Carows moved uptown in 1871, where Edith attended Miss Comstock&#x27;s School. Here she developed a lifelong sense of strict religious morality. She also learned to speak fluent French and took a more active interest in English literature, with a particular focus on the works of William Shakespeare.

=== Adolescence and young adulthood ===
During the celebrations for the centennial of the United States in 1876, Edith visited the White House, afterward commenting that it would be unlikely that she should ever visit it again. After graduating from Miss Comstock&#x27;s School in 1879, she participated in New York&#x27;s social life, attending balls and making social calls. She was unable to travel, as she had to stay home tending for her parents, who had both fallen ill.

Edith and Theodore grew closer as teenagers, and they developed romantic feelings for one another. They stayed in contact when Theodore went to Harvard University, but they had a falling-out in August 1878. The details surrounding this stage of their relationship are not known. Various reasons have been proposed by the families and by historians for their split, including a rejected proposal, Theodore Roosevelt Sr.&#x27;s disapproval of Charles Carow&#x27;s alcoholism, a rumor that the Roosevelts were afflicted with scrofula, or clashing personalities between their strong tempers. They rekindled their friendship in December 1879. By this time, Theodore was engaged to his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee. This caused Edith grief, but she held a dinner in the couple&#x27;s honor and attended their wedding. She maintained a close relationship with the Roosevelts over the following years, though she was cold toward Alice. Edith&#x27;s father died from alcohol-related illness in 1883.

Theodore&#x27;s wife and his mother Martha Bulloch Roosevelt both died in February 1884, so he moved west to distance himself from his life in New York. Edith did not see him for the following year. He avoided her intentionally, worrying that he would be betraying Alice if he developed feelings for Edith. When Theodore returned to New York in September 1885, he encountered Edith by chance at his sister&#x27;s house. They renewed their relationship and were secretly engaged that November, unwilling to disclose that Theodore was to rewed so soon after the death of his wife. After their engagement was set, they separated for eight months so Edith could help her mother and sister move to Europe while Theodore could settle his business affairs on the frontier. They remained in contact, but she preserved only one of these letters.

Edith and her sister inherited an interest in a building on Stone Street in New York, and in 1886 they took the New York Elevated Railroad Company and the Manhattan Railway Company to court, alleging that the companies had caused damage to the building during rail construction. The trial went on until it was decided in the Carow sisters&#x27; favor in 1890.

== Marriage and family ==
=== Sagamore Hill ===
Edith and Theodore traveled to London, where they were wed at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, on December 2, 1886. They spent their honeymoon in Europe over the winter, going to France and then visiting Edith&#x27;s family at their new home in Italy before returning to England. The Roosevelts returned to New York in March 1887. They stayed with Theodore&#x27;s sister Bamie for the next two months, then moved into Leeholm, the Oyster Bay house that Theodore had intended to live in with his first wife. The house was subsequently renamed Sagamore Hill. Edith promptly had her own family&#x27;s furniture brought in to replace the furniture from Theodore&#x27;s previous marriage. This was to be the Roosevelts&#x27; home for the rest of their lives. Edith decided that her stepdaughter Alice was to live with them and was to refer to Edith as her mother. Separating Alice from her aunt, who had previously been caring for her, began a lifelong enmity between Edith and her stepdaughter.

Sagamore Hill had a staff of approximately 12 servants, and Edith found herself managing the entire staff and estate by herself. Each morning, Edith tended to the household chores while Theodore worked on his writing, and then the two went walking or rowing in the afternoons. She was content with a quiet, domestic life, but she accepted that Theodore would often bring home company for her to entertain. To her displeasure, her husband was frequently away on trips west. She began suffering headaches that plagued her for the rest of her life, sometimes leaving her bedridden.

Edith&#x27;s first child, Theodore III, was born September 13, 1887. She hired her own childhood nanny, Mary Ledwith, to care for the children. Edith then underwent a period of postpartum depression, and she experienced a miscarriage the following year.

Managing the family became a large responsibility, in part because she considered her husband to be one of the children for his involvement in their trouble-making, and she frequently hosted their family friend Cecil Spring Rice. In October 1888, Edith joined Theodore in traveling west to campaign for Benjamin Harrison in that year&#x27;s presidential election, finding the experience enjoyable. After Harrison&#x27;s victory, he repaid Theodore with a position on the Civil Service Commission. Edith was pregnant again, and she stayed at Sagamore Hill while Theodore moved to Washington, D.C. His absences especially took a toll on her while she was pregnant, causing her further depression. Edith&#x27;s second son, Kermit, was born on October 10, 1889. She joined her husband in Washington that December.

=== Washington, D.C. ===
During her time in Washington, Edith took on more serious hosting responsibilities as the wife of a political figure, and she befriended several of the city&#x27;s major figures, developing a particularly close friendship with Henry Adams. She preferred Washington to New York, and after arriving, she made her first of many visits to the Smithsonian Institution and Fischer&#x27;s antique shop. She looked back fondly on these years later in life. She attended several receptions at the White House in 1890 with her husband, and was now received as a guest rather than a tourist. She retired to Sagamore Hill that summer at the end of the social season, and she accompanied Theodore on his travels west. While initially hesitant, she came to share her husband&#x27;s love of the Badlands and Yellowstone.

Edith gave birth to a daughter, Ethel, on August 13, 1891. With a growing family and both their New York and Washington homes to maintain, the Roosevelts struggled financially. Edith was in charge of all the family&#x27;s finances, keeping meticulous records and allotting $20 per day to her husband (). The increasingly erratic behavior of Theodore&#x27;s alcoholic brother Elliott became the family&#x27;s primary focus until his sudden death in 1894.

The Roosevelts were invited to dine at the White House for the first time on February 1, 1894, where Edith was seated directly next to President Grover Cleveland. Edith had another son, Archibald, on April 9, 1894. When Theodore considered running a campaign to be mayor of New York in 1894, Edith implored him not to because she preferred life in Washington and because he would have a smaller salary as mayor. He regretted not running to the point of depression, and Edith made a promise not to give further input on his political career. The promise was not kept for long.

=== Entering public life ===

Theodore was appointed New York City Police Commissioner in 1895, and the Roosevelts again made New York their primary residence. Edith was reluctant to leave Washington and her social circle in the city, but the move also came with an increased salary for Theodore. Edith&#x27;s mother died in April of the same year, and Edith&#x27;s sister Emily came to live with the Roosevelts for several months. Theodore was rarely at home as he became heavily invested in his work. Edith eventually joined him in the city whenever he worked overnight, and after her period of mourning for her mother ended, she began attending cultural events in the city.

The Roosevelts returned to Washington in 1897 when Theodore was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by the newly elected president William McKinley. Edith once again delayed her move to Washington because of pregnancy. Her final child, Quentin, was born on November 9, 1897. She spent the following four months recovering from an abdominal abscess and the resulting surgery.

With the onset of the Spanish–American War, Edith supported American efforts to end Spanish rule over Cuba. Though she was apprehensive about Theodore&#x27;s desire to join the fighting, she defended his decision against critics. She traveled to Florida on June 1, 1898, to see Theodore off as he left to fight with the Rough Riders. Edith wrote to him almost every day while he was away and stayed informed through the newspaper, which often covered his exploits with the Rough Riders as he became increasingly famous. The Rough Riders returned to the United States that August and were put under quarantine in Montauk, New York, as disease had spread on the battlefield. Violating the quarantine, Edith and Theodore secretly reunited, and she worked tirelessly at the camp over the next four days as a Red Cross volunteer.

Theodore returned as a war hero, and their home became a place of public interest. When he began his campaign to be elected Governor of New York in the fall of 1898, Edith worried he would be targeted by anarchist assassins. She did not join him on the campaign, out of both her need to support the children and her desire to avoid public attention. She instead took charge of the mail that he received. Theodore went on to win the election, making Edith the first lady of New York.

== First lady of New York ==

At the reception for Theodore&#x27;s inauguration as governor, Edith held a bouquet in each hand so she would not have to shake hands with the thousands of visitors—a technique that she used throughout her husband&#x27;s political career. Her children were older by this point, and their time in school or with a governess gave her a degree of freedom from her previous responsibilities. She renovated the New York State Executive Mansion in Albany after moving in so that it was a suitable home for her children, and she redecorated it with new artwork.

Edith grew comfortable with her life in Albany, as it brought financial security and her role as first lady allowed her to spend more time with her husband. She pursued new hobbies in the city, joining the Friday Morning Club and accompanying Frances Theodora Parsons on botanical trips. Edith was more cautious about public life as her husband became one of the most prominent figures in American politics. Her receptions and public activity were the subject of national press coverage, though it was generally positive. Edith&#x27;s primary focus when entertaining was the flower arrangements, while an aide addressed food, seating, and music. In March 1900, Edith and her sister vacationed in Cuba where she visited San Juan Hill, the site of her husband&#x27;s most famous battle.

As the 1900 presidential election approached, Theodore considered running for Vice President of the United States. Edith was uncomfortable with the proposition. It would again uproot the family&#x27;s lives in a move to Washington, and it would come with a lower salary than the governorship. The two at one point drafted an official declination of the role saying he was needed as the governor of New York, but he attended the 1900 Republican National Convention and was chosen to join the Republican Party&#x27;s electoral ticket. In the days leading up to the convention, the Roosevelts dined at the White House with President McKinley, where Edith reveled in the fact that she and Theodore were much younger than the other guests of their status. As the presidential campaign commenced, she tended to their home while he traveled to garner support. She became very thin during the campaign, because of the stress of Theodore being away and the possibility that he might win. After Theodore was elected vice president, Edith began receiving requests that she donate some of her possessions to be auctioned, as was common for prominent women of the time. She started a diary, deciding that her insights as the wife of a public figure were worth preserving.

Edith attended Theodore&#x27;s inauguration as vice president in Washington on March 4, 1901. Edith and the children subsequently had lunch with President William McKinley, watched the inaugural parade, and returned to Sagamore Hill. Theodore joined the rest of the family soon after, as the vice president was not needed until the next Congressional session later in the year. Edith felt that the job&#x27;s limited duties made it a poor fit for her perennially active husband. Nonetheless, she was glad to have more time with him. Over the following months, they attended the Pan-American Exposition, went horseback riding with Edith&#x27;s new horse Yagenka, and endured a variety of medical ailments in the family.

In August 1901, Edith took her children on a vacation to the Adirondack Mountains while Theodore was on a speaking tour. It was here that she received a telephone call from her husband informing her that President McKinley had been shot. Edith correctly speculated that the perpetrator was an anarchist. McKinley died on September 14, 1901. Only six months into his term as vice president, Theodore became president of the United States, and Edith became the nation&#x27;s first lady.

=== Becoming first lady ===
Edith dreaded the idea of Theodore being president, fearing both for his safety and for her children who would receive national attention. Only after leaving the White House did she realize how severely these anxieties affected her. Especially stressful were Theodore&#x27;s absences on tours and hunting trips, during which she was in constant worry until his return. Edith feared that he would not do well under the confinement he would experience as president, and she worried that he was too young to be president. She received some relief at the beginning of her tenure when she spoke to former president Cleveland about Theodore as president, to which he simply responded &quot;don&#x27;t worry, he is all right&quot;.

Edith&#x27;s first duty in her new role was to attend the funeral of William McKinley. Upon entering the White House, she rearranged the furniture in the living quarters and then promptly slept for two days. One benefit of their new position meant that the Roosevelts no longer had to worry about money, and she came to enjoy her life as first lady. For her sitting room, Edith used an oval library adjacent to the president&#x27;s office. From here she could watch over him and scold him if he was working too late. Instead of overseeing meal preparation in the White House, Edith hired caterers, allowing her to lighten her schedule and to avoid potential criticism for poor catering decisions. She likewise delegated management of the staff to the chief usher. Rather than hiring a housekeeper, she took personal responsibility for the care of the mansion.

=== Life as first lady ===

Edith&#x27;s mornings as first lady often entailed answering her mail, reading the newspaper, shopping, and studying French. In the evenings, she spent time with her children and went horseback riding with her husband. Despite the tribulations of White House life, Edith and Theodore adored one another and maintained a strong relationship. Each Tuesday, Edith organized a meeting with the wives of all the cabinet members to run concurrently with cabinet meetings. Here they planned and budgeted White House entertainment, and they made sure the wives&#x27; entertainment did not overshadow that of the White House. Here Edith also governed who was allowed on guest lists, excluding anyone that did not meet her moral standards, particularly those suspected of adultery.

In tandem with her responsibilities as first lady, Edith continued acting as the caregiver for her children. She tended to her children and her husband whenever they fell ill or were injured, which happened many times throughout her tenure. Quentin&#x27;s childhood friend Earle Looker later wrote that Edith seemed to regret that her role as first lady prevented her from being more active in the children&#x27;s play. She hoped for another child, but her two pregnancies in 1902 and 1903 both resulted in miscarriages. For two months beginning in April 1903, Theodore ventured off on a trip to the west. Edith cared for the children on her own at this time, first when she was on a cruise aboard the USS &quot;Mayflower&quot; and after she returned to the White House. Worried about his safety the entire time, she was relieved when he returned. Besides her own children, Edith also made sure to dedicate time to her stepdaughter Alice, who felt neglected by Theodore.
The White House became too hot in the summer, so the Roosevelts returned to Sagamore Hill each year. Edith was confident in Theodore&#x27;s chances for his reelection in 1904, as she had a low estimation of his opponent, Alton B. Parker. She nonetheless lost five pounds from stress as the election neared. Edith was disappointed when, in the jubilation of his victory, Theodore announced that he would not run for election again. She knew he would come to regret the announcement, and she later said that she would have done anything in her power to prevent it if she had known what he was going to say.

In May 1905, Edith set off to create a presidential retreat to which the family could escape. Their home at Sagamore Hill was frequently visited by reporters, politicians, and those seeking favors of the president. She went to the Blue Ridge Mountains in Albemarle County, Virginia, where she purchased a cabin from a family friend. This cabin became Theodore&#x27;s presidential retreat, Pine Knot. The same year, Edith joined Theodore in a voyage to Panama to oversee the construction of the Panama Canal. Theodore left for another trip across the United States in fall 1907, and she again grew anxious for his return, looking forward to each letter he sent. In the final ten months of her tenure as first lady, a series of attacks on unaccompanied women in Washington led Theodore to appoint a bodyguard for Edith&#x27;s walks. He chose Archibald Butt, the new White House military aide. Butt accompanied Edith on her walks and shopping trips, and she felt herself able to speak freely to him in a way that she did not with most people.

=== White House hostess ===

The nation was in mourning when the Roosevelts entered the White House, so the first lady&#x27;s traditional role of hosting social events was postponed for 30 days. As Washington became active, Edith increased the number of social events held by the White House each season, including dinners, teas, garden parties, and concerts. The 1902 social season saw approximately 40,000 people visit the White House, far more than any previous year.

Edith found comfort in the fact that the first lady did not have to make social calls, instead receiving them from others each afternoon. Being first lady came with new obligations that she disliked, including participation in large receiving lines and the White House Easter Egg Roll. She found the egg roll distasteful, saying that it ruined the grass and lamenting the smell of rotting eggs as the event went on. Though &quot;first lady&quot; had already become a common term for the president&#x27;s wife, she never used the title herself, instead signing her name as Mrs. Roosevelt.

While the Roosevelts were staying in Oyster Bay in 1902, Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia was touring the United States, and he engaged in what Edith considered to be vulgar behavior. She refused to recognize him socially, leaving to have lunch with relatives before he arrived to meet Theodore. Her rejection of the duke was praised by the press and by members of the Russian aristocracy.

The tone of the White House improved after Theodore&#x27;s reelection, as the beginning of this term was a cause for celebration instead of the mourning that followed the assassination of President McKinley. This led up to Edith&#x27;s most prominent social event as first lady, in which she hosted the White House wedding of her stepdaughter Alice to Congressman Nicholas Longworth on February 17, 1906.

=== White House renovations ===
Edith disliked the White House upon moving in, saying that it was &quot;like living over the store&quot;. The building had become cramped with more employees as the scope of federal politics changed over the 19th century, and demand for workspace restricted the residential areas. Renovations began on the building in 1902, and the Roosevelts found other places to live for six months. While Theodore moved to a house on Lafayette Square, Edith returned to Sagamore Hill with the children. From here, she stayed updated on the renovations and prevented the implementation of any ideas she disliked. The work was carried out by McKim, Mead &amp; White. The earliest point of contention was the location of the White House conservatory; the architect Charles Follen McKim wished to destroy it, and Edith protested. They settled on relocating it, an agreement that McKim dubbed the &quot;Treaty of Oyster Bay&quot;. She also objected to McKim&#x27;s proposed design for her writing desk, calling it &quot;ugly and inconvenient&quot;.

Edith saw the construction of a feature long desired by past first ladies: separate living quarters secluded from the executive offices and public areas, allowing the family to live uninterrupted by visitors. This separation came with the establishment of the West Wing and the East Wing. Aware that extravagant spending could provoke controversy, she reduced costs wherever possible, having older furniture brought in rather than purchasing newer items. The largest change was in the East Room, which was entirely redesigned, including a new ceiling, wallpaper, carpeting, and three electric crystal chandeliers. She also had a tennis court installed, hoping that it would encourage her husband to maintain a healthy weight. Other projects included changes to the public areas and a redesign of the garden. The renovations were generally received positively. The Roosevelts moved back into the White House on November 4, 1902, as renovations finished over the following month.

After the State Dining Room was expanded to seat over one hundred guests, Edith purchased more china for the White House. Unable to find American-made china, she had Wedgwood china imported to the United States where it was painted with the great seal. She then ensured the continuation of the White House china collection that had been started by former first lady Caroline Harrison. Along with her social secretary Belle Hagner and the reporter Abby Gunn Baker, Edith tracked down much of the china used by previous administrations. At the end of her tenure, she had all of the damaged pieces destroyed, feeling that selling or gifting them would degrade the collection. She also organized the creation of a portrait gallery that featured official portraits of the first ladies. Since then, every first lady has had an official portrait created.

=== Political influence ===

Edith did not share her political opinions publicly, but she often discussed them with her husband—a fact that was generally known by the public. Since Theodore did not read the newspapers, Edith read four each day and brought clippings to him if she thought they warranted his attention. It is unknown to what extent or in what areas Edith had political influence over her husband. One government official, Gifford Pinchot, said that she had &quot;much more ... to do with government business than was commonly supposed&quot; after Theodore appointed her preferred candidate, James Rudolph Garfield, to the Civil Service Commission. She sometimes worked with William Loeb Jr., the president&#x27;s secretary, to convince Theodore of her ideas.

Edith often dissuaded Theodore from ideas she disliked. When he asked for reduced security, she instructed the Secret Service to ignore his request. She also had two Secret Service agents stationed at Pine Knot each night without telling Theodore. Edith had little interest in the political affairs of the Republican Party and its members, but she took an interest in certain political issues and gave her evaluations of the men with whom the Roosevelts interacted. She agreed with Theodore&#x27;s policies when he became adamant about progressive reforms in his second term.

Shortly after becoming first lady, Edith put her efforts toward helping her friend Frances Metcalfe Wolcott reunite with her ex-husband following a divorce. Theodore wished to keep her ex-husband, former senator Edward O. Wolcott, from returning to the senate. This was in part because of political alliances, but Edith had a negative opinion of him for neglecting Frances that may have also played a role. The Roosevelts were successful in keeping Edward from being elected, but he never reunited with Frances. The Roosevelts later got Frances&#x27;s son, Lyman M. Bass, a prominent position as a New York district attorney.

Edith often served as an intermediary for the Roosevelts&#x27; associates to get information to the president. During peace negotiations for the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, she was in contact with Cecil Spring Rice, who at this point was a diplomat at the British embassy in Russia. It would have been untoward for Spring Rice and Theodore to communicate directly given their respective positions, but Spring Rice wrote to Edith and his letters included valuable information for Theodore.

=== Charitable work and the arts ===
Edith donated handkerchiefs and other items to be auctioned for charity during the first two years of her tenure, establishing a &quot;handkerchief bureau&quot; to facilitate the donations. She stopped after the handkerchiefs were scrutinized and criticized, which caused her a great deal of emotional distress. She also made anonymous donations from her personal funds to those in need, so long as she could first confirm the facts to ensure she was not &quot;&#x27;carrying&#x27; people when they should &#x27;learn to walk. Edith frequently did needlework for charity, participating in the St. Hilda Sewing Circle with Oyster Bay&#x27;s Christ Episcopal Church. She voiced her support for the Audubon Society&#x27;s efforts to end the use of decorative plumes on women&#x27;s hats in 1905, and she joined the New York Assembly of Mothers in 1907.

Edith sponsored a variety of classical instrumentalists and singers, giving them a venue to perform at the White House. She enjoyed classical music, including the work of Richard Wagner. Edith hosted the famous German composer Engelbert Humperdinck when he visited the United States, which led to her appearance at a charity performance of Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; for The Legal Aid Society. She also supported the theater and allowed the performance of plays at the White House at a time when actors were seen as lower class.

=== Press and public relations ===
Among Edith&#x27;s greatest concerns with becoming first lady was the effect it would have on her privacy. This was something she valued, and she considered the press to be her greatest annoyance while living in the White House. She exerted her influence over journalists: for example, when she wore the same dress on multiple occasions, she convinced the reporters to describe it differently each time. To control media coverage of her family, she had photographs taken of herself and her children that were then given to the press.

It became common practice for well-off women to hire a secretary in the 1890s, but no first lady had ever done this. A few weeks into her tenure, Edith hired Belle Hagner as a social secretary, creating the first formalized staff office for the first lady. Hagner was responsible for answering Edith&#x27;s mail, managing her schedule, overseeing guest lists, and communicating information about the first lady&#x27;s activities to the press. In Theodore&#x27;s second term, Congressman Thomas W. Hardwick objected to Hagner&#x27;s employment on government funds and raised a motion to dismiss her. The remainder of the United States House of Representatives saw this as an affront against the first lady, and Hardwick was the lone voice in support of the motion.

Fashion was not important to Edith, who often kept outfits over multiple seasons. She sometimes had adjustments made to keep them updated. When Marion Graves Anthon Fish wrote a critical article about the first lady&#x27;s fashion consisting of &quot;three hundred dollars a year&quot;, Edith cut it from the newspaper and placed it in her scrapbook. The first published caricature of a first lady depicted Edith during her husband&#x27;s dinner at the White House with Booker T. Washington.

=== Departure ===
Edith was skeptical when Theodore selected the secretary of war William Howard Taft as his successor to run as a candidate in the 1908 presidential election. This was complicated by the attempts of Taft&#x27;s wife, Helen Herron Taft, to exert her own influence on the White House. Edith and Helen had developed a rivalry over the years, both distrusting each other and the other&#x27;s husband. This contributed to a similar animosity between Theodore and William in the following years. The tone of the White House became melancholy when the 1909 social season began as the Roosevelts&#x27; presence there was nearing its end. The incoming Taft family, though generally well-liked, lacked the energetic reputation of the Roosevelts. Helen Taft had already begun planning the changes she would make in the staff. Edith had bonded with these people over the years and became emotional when discussing Taft&#x27;s intentions.

While taking inventory of her belongings, Edith caused controversy because she intended to keep a $40 couch () that had been purchased during White House renovations. After the backlash, she decided to leave it behind, saying that it was now tainted by negative associations with the scandal. Archibald Butt described this incident as the only time he ever saw her angry. Two years later, President Taft bought a new couch and had the original sent to her. As their time in the White House came to a close, Theodore grew excited about the prospect of a year-long African safari. This frightened Edith, especially when he said that he did not fear death during the expedition. The Roosevelts learned of the sudden death of their nephew Stewart Robinson shortly before leaving, and they spent these final days in mourning.

== Return to Sagamore Hill ==
After leaving the White House in 1909, Edith returned to Sagamore Hill while Theodore and Kermit went on a safari. Her children had all moved out except for Ethel, who had just reached adulthood. The solitude became too much for Edith after a few months, so she took Ethel, Quentin, and Archibald on a trip to Europe, where they visited France, Switzerland, and Italy, including a stay at the home of Edith&#x27;s sister. They returned in November, only for Edith and Ethel to leave for Egypt the following March to reunite with Theodore and go on another European tour. They returned to New York in June 1910, and for the first time in nearly two years, Edith, Theodore, and their children were all reunited. Theodore began embarking on speaking tours shortly after their return, again leaving Edith alone until she eventually decided to accompany him in March 1911.

With her life having settled and her children all grown, Edith found herself wishing for a grandchild. This wish came true on August 6, 1911, when Theodore III and his wife Eleanor Alexander had a daughter, Grace. Edith was severely injured the following month after being thrown off of her horse. She was unconscious for the next two days and underwent physical rehabilitation for several months thereafter. She temporarily lost her sense of taste from the accident, and she permanently lost her sense of smell. As she recovered, Edith and Ethel left for a weeks-long trip to the Caribbean in February, giving her a chance to get away as Theodore again became active politically.

Edith strongly disliked the idea of Theodore returning to politics. She advised him not to run for president in the 1912 election, asserting that he would &quot;never be president again&quot;. When her attempts to discourage him failed, she assisted him in speech writing and accompanied him to the 1912 Progressive National Convention, though she did not campaign for him. Edith again feared for Theodore&#x27;s safety as he resumed his political activity, and her fears were validated when he was shot by John Schrank while campaigning. Theodore lost the election, and Edith loathed the eventual winner, Woodrow Wilson, whom she considered a &quot;vile and hypocritical charlatan&quot;.

In June 1913, Edith learned that her sister was to undergo an appendectomy and traveled to Italy to join her, staying until August. Theodore and Kermit went on another expedition later that year, this time to South America. Edith accompanied them in the beginning, returning home as they began the second stage of the trip charting unexplored areas in Brazil. Theodore&#x27;s trek was dangerous and nearly fatal, leaving Edith worried until his return in May 1914. Her health declined that year, preventing her from attending Kermit&#x27;s wedding. In April 1915, Edith underwent what was described as &quot;a necessary operation&quot;.

As Theodore led the movement for United States involvement in World War I, Edith found that she no longer had the energy to keep up with political figures passing through their home. For her part, Edith marched with the &quot;Independent Patriotic Women of America&quot;, which had been organized by Theodore III and his wife Eleanor. She also became president of the Needlework Guild. To get away from the politics of the war, Edith and Theodore left for the Caribbean in February 1916. They had planned further vacations over the following year, but as relations with Germany declined, the Roosevelts canceled them in anticipation of war. When the United States declared war, Edith encouraged her sons to fight. She took up typing to distract herself when they left for war, but this effort was short-lived. On July 17, 1918, Edith learned that Quentin&#x27;s plane had been shot down and that he had been killed. To escape the reminders of Quentin at Sagamore Hill, Edith, Theodore, and Quentin&#x27;s fiancée Flora Payne Whitney spent a month at Ethel&#x27;s home in Dark Harbor, Maine.

== Widowhood ==
Theodore&#x27;s health declined in 1918, and he was hospitalized on November 11. Edith stayed by him each day until his death on January 6, 1919. As was tradition for the widow, she stayed inside while the funeral took place two days later. Edith considered herself to have died with Theodore—something she told only her sister-in-law Corinne—but she felt that she had to do her part for the family and take on Theodore&#x27;s family responsibilities as well. From February through May, she went to Europe to see her sons, stay with her sister, and visit Quentin&#x27;s grave. She then accompanied Kermit on a vacation in South America that December. Both of these trips were fueled by a need to avoid memories of Theodore at Oyster Bay, but she began traveling for leisure as time passed. The following decade was marked by further ventures around the world.

Edith did not need the pension provided to first ladies, but she worried about embarrassing the other former first ladies by refusing it. She instead used the funds to support others, including former members of Theodore&#x27;s Rough Riders. To maintain some control over Theodore&#x27;s legacy, Edith also agreed to work with all of her husband&#x27;s biographers, though she did not approve of all their work. She especially disliked the biography written by Henry F. Pringle for its portrayal of Theodore as immature.

When the 1920 presidential election approached, Edith campaigned for Republican Warren G. Harding. She made appeals to women specifically, as they had just been granted the right to vote. In January 1921, Edith traveled the Caribbean, including a voyage deep into the jungle of British Guiana with a party of six to see Kaieteur Falls. She joined Archibald on a trip to Europe in January 1922, where they visited Paris, Berlin, and then London, taking her first airplane trip to the latter. From Europe, she traveled on her own to South Africa. Edith hosted a party for Theodore&#x27;s friends in 1922 in which they visited his grave and shared their memories of him, which became a yearly tradition. After hearing that her grandson Richard Derby Jr. had died in late 1922, she traveled to Pará, Brazil, the following January to distract herself. She traveled through Connecticut in April 1923, where she visited her ancestors&#x27; hometown Brooklyn, Connecticut. This inspired her to research her ancestry more thoroughly.

Edith and Kermit went on another trip in December 1923, going to California and then Hawaii before arriving in Japan the following January. The region had just been devastated by the Great Kantō earthquake, and tremors were still frequently occurring. They stayed at the newly constructed Imperial Hotel, which was designed to withstand earthquakes, but Edith feared for her safety as the tremors continued. She was delighted by the Noh drama performed in Japan, particularly &quot;Sumida-gawa&quot;, which told the story of a mother who lost her son. She had a much lower opinion of China and the Soviet Union as she passed through them.

== Further travel and political involvement ==
Theodore III was a candidate in the 1924 New York gubernatorial election. Franklin D. Roosevelt (Theodore&#x27;s fifth cousin) and his wife Eleanor Roosevelt (Theodore&#x27;s niece) lambasted Theodore III as they campaigned for his opponent, brewing resentment from Edith. That same year, Edith co-wrote a travelogue titled &quot;Cleared for Strange Ports&quot; with Kermit and his family. In 1925, Edith and Kermit published another book together, &quot;American Backlogs: The Story of Gertrude Tyler and Her Family, 1660–1860&quot;, detailing the history of Edith&#x27;s ancestors in New England. The book was of interest to only a limited few and saw poor sales.

Edith traveled to Yucatán, Mexico, in early 1926 where she visited Chichen Itza. That year, she began featuring the poet Elbert Newton as a guest of honor in a poetry reading group that she hosted. The following year, Edith took a ferry across the Paraná River to the Iguazu Falls on the border between Argentina and Brazil. By this time, Edith was beginning to have heart murmurs, which she called her heart attacks. Knowing that her health would no longer let her travel frequently, she searched for a vacation home in the United States. She purchased Mortlake Manor in Brooklyn, Connecticut, which had been built for her great-grandfather, Daniel Tyler III. Around this time, Edith confessed to her daughter that after leading a happy life, she had only been happy twice since Theodore&#x27;s death—both times in a dream. She took multiple trips to Mortlake Manor each year from then on, including an annual pilgrimage on July 4. Edith was not significantly affected by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. After Theodore III was appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Edith went to stay there in January 1930 and again that December. She traveled to Jamaica the following March.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the 1932 presidential election, Edith was frustrated by well-wishers who congratulated her, believing Franklin to be her son. Over 300 letters celebrating Franklin&#x27;s nomination arrived at Sagamore Hill. She vocally proclaimed support for Franklin&#x27;s opponent, Herbert Hoover, and began campaigning for him. To demonstrate her support, she took an airplane to the White House, visiting it for the first time since she was first lady. She did not recognize the interior, as it had been thoroughly refurnished, and she considered the whole experience &quot;hateful&quot;. Franklin went on to win the election. Theodore III had been appointed Governor-General of the Philippines under the Hoover administration, and Edith traveled to visit him there shortly before the inauguration. Edith opposed Franklin&#x27;s New Deal policies, insisting that they were nothing like Theodore&#x27;s progressive platform. She maintained good relations with her niece-in-law Eleanor after the latter became first lady, and she generally approved of Eleanor&#x27;s public activities.

== Later life and death ==
Edith&#x27;s heart condition, diagnosed as paroxysmal tachycardia, left her in pain for hours at a time as it became more severe in the 1930s. She spent March 1934 in Greece before making her final journey to South America in January 1935. Her income at this point had decreased, and she could no longer afford elaborate vacations. Edith then broke her hip after taking a fall that November. It did not heal well, and she spent five months in the hospital. The injury meant she could no longer live an active life. Continuing her recovery in early 1937, she rented a home, Magnolia Manor, for a few months in St. Andrew&#x27;s, Florida. She had not seen the house before renting it and discovered that it was a cockroach-infested house in a poor neighborhood, cast under shadow by moss-dripping trees.

Edith spent the early months of 1938 in Portugal, though she found the journey much more difficult in her old age. While she was in Haiti in early 1939, she received news that her sister was dying in Italy. The two had been almost estranged by that point, and Edith spent the rest of her life guilt-ridden, feeling that she had abandoned her sister. As she neared 80 years old in 1941, Edith felt greatly ashamed as she found herself no longer capable of managing her own finances and mail. Kermit&#x27;s alcoholism became more severe in 1941, and he fatally shot himself on June 4, 1943. Edith had adored Kermit especially among her children, and no one told her that his death was a suicide. Theodore III died from a heart attack during World War II.

Edith was bedridden in early 1947, where she stayed for the remainder of her life. She died at the age of 87 on September 30, 1948, a day after she fell into a coma. She was buried next to her husband. Edith wished for a simple funeral, and by the time of her death she had recorded every detail of how to organize it. Her instructions were: &quot;Simplest coffin possible. If the church has no pall, cover with one of my crepe shawls. Nothing on coffin but bunch of pink and blue flowers from my children. Processional Hymn No. 85 &#x27;The Son of God.&#x27; Not slow tempo. Recessional Hymn No. 226 &#x27;Love Divine.&#x27; The anthem from Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. Service as in Prayer Book. Do not take off my wedding ring and please no embalming.&quot; Her chosen epitaph read, &quot;Everything she did was for the happiness of others.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Edith was widely popular as first lady, maintaining strong public approval until her tenure ended. She was compared positively against her predecessor, Ida Saxton McKinley, whose poor health prevented her from being active as first lady. Edith was more socially active than the first ladies of the preceding two decades, as they either had abbreviated tenures or were unable to fulfill their duties. Besides social activity, Edith was the most athletic first lady to occupy the White House at that point, regularly engaging in walks and horseback riding. She was the last first lady to live in an environment where horseback riding was a common part of life, and she disliked using automobiles.

Edith is often recognized for the wisdom, both scholarly and political, that she provided her husband throughout his career. She read extensively throughout her life, preferring British, French, and German writers of the 19th century, including William Makepeace Thackeray and Jean Racine. Theodore once confessed his belief that she looked down on his literary knowledge, and he acknowledged that he was worse off whenever he did not take her advice.

Historians have little information about Edith&#x27;s own state of mind while studying her life, as she avoided public comment and did not preserve her letters. She worried that her letters might some day be published, and she sometimes requested that recipients destroy them after reading. Surviving letters and other papers are kept in various archival collections, including those of the Harvard Library and the Library of Congress. Many of Edith&#x27;s relatives and associates wrote memoirs that include detailed descriptions of their interactions. She was given little scholarly attention in the decades after her death. The first full biography about her, and the largest in scope, was &quot;Edith Kermit Roosevelt: Portrait of a First Lady&quot;, published by Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1980.

=== Historical evaluation ===
Historians credit Edith for developing the first lady&#x27;s office as its own institution. The historian Catherine Forslund described Edith as the &quot;first truly modern occupant of her post&quot;, citing her involvement in the White House renovations and her hiring of a secretary. The historian Stacy A. Cordery said that the White House renovations organized by Edith were one of her &quot;most important legacies&quot;, and that her hiring of a secretary was &quot;a significant innovation crucial to the creation of the modern institution of first ladies&quot;.

Historians disagree about Edith&#x27;s views on race. Lewis L. Gould pointed to her use of racist language and the fact that she allowed racist songs to be performed at the White House to suggest strong anti-black views. Black people were specifically disallowed from her receptions, as was anyone of a lower social class. Gould presented a negative image of Edith overall, portraying her as having an &quot;acidic personality&quot; and casting doubt on her success as a mother. Deborah Davis contradicted Gould&#x27;s account and said that Edith was an admirer of Booker T. Washington.

<text>In cabinetry, the bargueño (or vargueño, ; meaning &quot;from Bargas&quot;) is a form of portable desk, made up of two chests, the bottom one usually having drawers (called a &quot;taquillón&quot;) and the top one having a hinged desk surface which also serves as a side-mounted lid. It is basically a chest or box with one of the side panels, rather than the top panel, serving as a fold-out writing surface. The interior of the desk is equipped with small drawers, pigeonholes, etc., for storing papers and supplies. The bargueño has also been used for sewing or as a jewel chest.
The bargueño desk originated in Renaissance Spain. The desk was typically made of wood, with sturdy iron handles located on each side, to make transporting it relatively easy. A bargueño could be set down on any solid table, but often had a ready-made support for it: either a &quot;taquillón&quot;, a chest of drawers in the same material and style as the bargueño; or a &quot;pie de puente&quot;, a small trestle table. As a general rule, the interior of a bargueño is much more richly decorated than the exterior. Thus a bargueño looking very plain from the exterior will have a reasonably rich and well sculpted interior, while a bargueño with impressive exterior decorations will have a truly ornate and extremely rich interior.

Bargueño desks were first produced in the 15th century and were popular through the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. After a lull in the 19th century, they became again popular as antiques in the 20th century and continue to be produced today. The only other style of desk which is known to have been continuously produced for so long is the trestle desk, but some authorities exclude this desk from consideration because in early times it also served as a dining table and money lender&#x27;s counter.
The only other major antique combination of a large portable desk and a frame is the more delicate desk on a frame of the 18th century, which was popular in Colonial America. When the top and bottom chests are permanently attached or built as one piece there is a desk form called a Fall front desk. It is supposed that the fall front desk form gradually evolved from the desk on a chest towards the end of the Renaissance.

<text>In theology, divine providence, or simply providence, is God&#x27;s intervention in the Universe. The term &quot;Divine Providence&quot; (usually capitalized) is also used as a title of God. A distinction is usually made between &quot;general providence&quot;, which refers to God&#x27;s continuous upholding of the existence and natural order of the Universe, and &quot;special providence&quot;, which refers to God&#x27;s extraordinary intervention in the life of people. Miracles and even retribution generally fall in the latter category.

==Etymology==
&quot;Divine&quot; evolved in the late 14th century to mean &quot;pertaining to, in the nature of or proceeding from God or a god&quot;. This came from the Old French , with a similar meaning, and that from the Latin , meaning &quot;of a god&quot;, in turn from , with similar meaning, which was related the Latin , meaning god or deity. The word &quot;providence&quot; comes from Latin meaning foresight or prudence, and that in turn from &quot;ahead&quot; and &quot;to see&quot;. The current use of the word in the secular sense refers to foresight, or &quot;timely preparation for eventualities&quot;, or (if one is a deist or an atheist) &quot;nature as providing protective care&quot;.

==Theology==
===Jewish===

Divine providence ( &quot;Hashgochoh Protis&quot; / &quot;Hashgachah Pratit&quot; lit. [Divine] supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout Rabbinic literature, and in particular by the classical Jewish philosophers. These writings maintain that divine providence means that God is directing (or even recreating) every minute detail of creation. This analysis thus underpins much of Orthodox Judaism&#x27;s world view, particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.

===Roman Catholic===
Augustine of Hippo is often associated with the doctrine of divine providence in the Latin West. Augustine held that the universe is under the continuous control and unifying governance of a single Supreme Being, since God&#x27;s governance takes place over a vast multitude of relatively independent individuals differing in nature, function, and end.

Christian teaching on Providence in the High Middle Ages was most fully developed by Thomas Aquinas in the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;. The concept of providence as care exercised by God over the universe, His foresight and care for its future is extensively developed and explained both by Aquinas himself and modern Thomists. One of the foremost modern Thomists, Dominican father Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, wrote a study of providence entitled &quot;Providence: God&#x27;s loving care for men and the need for confidence in Almighty God.&quot; In it, He presents and solves, according to Catholic doctrine, the most difficult issues as related to Providence. However, Jean Pierre de Caussade (7 March 1675 – 8 December 1751) was a French Jesuit priest and writer. He is especially known for the work ascribed to him known as Abandonment to Divine Providence, and also his work with the Nuns of the Visitation in Nancy, France.

===Eastern Orthodox===
The doctrine of providence in Eastern Orthodoxy is set out by St. John of Tobolsk:
===Lutheran===

In Lutheran theology, divine providence refers to God&#x27;s preservation of creation, his cooperation with everything that happens, and his guiding of the universe. While God cooperates with both good and evil deeds, with the evil deeds he does so only in as much as they are deeds, not with the evil in them. God concurs with an act&#x27;s effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect. Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.

According to Martin Luther, divine providence began when God created the world with everything needed for human life, including both physical things and natural laws. In Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, the explanation of the first article of the Apostles&#x27; Creed declares that everything people have that is good is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things. Of the services others provide us through family, government, and work, he writes, &quot;we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God.&quot; Since God uses everyone&#x27;s useful tasks for good, people should look not down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.

===Reformed===

The concept of divine providence is an integral part of Reformed theology, which emphasizes the total depravity of man and the complete sovereignty of God. Article 13 of the Belgic Confession, a Reformed confession of faith, first outlines the doctrine, then explains why it does not entail that God is the author of evil, finally exhorting its readers to humility for this doctrine, which is said to afford great consolation to Christians.

The Confession draws from many biblical proof-texts, including (&quot;For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done&quot;). This text in particular is taken as illustrative of the concept of &quot;concursus dei&quot; (&#x27;divine concurrence&#x27;), which Reformed theologian Louis Berkhof defines as &quot;the cooperation of the divine power with all subordinate powers, according to the pre-established laws of their operation, causing them to act and to act precisely as they do&quot;. In the case of Acts 4, this means that the sinful doings of Herod, Pilate and others were permitted by God according to what his &quot;counsel&quot; had &quot;determined before to be done&quot;. Divine providence and human free will are thus not regarded as contradictory; rather the former is said to be the very ordering principle of the latter (and furthermore, evil cannot be attributed to God, as his permitting of evil to occur was only in view of a greater end, which is the redemption of the elect in Acts 4). This has two implications: Firstly, that: &quot;the powers of nature do not work by themselves, that is, simply by their own inherent power, but that God is immediately operative in every act of the creature.&quot; Secondly, that secondary causes &quot;are real, and not to be regarded simply as the operative power of God. It is only on condition that second causes are real, that we can properly speak of a concurrence or co-operation of the First Cause with secondary causes.&quot; The first implication, that God is &#x27;immediately operative in every act of the creature&#x27;, and steers the course of creation according to his will, distinguishes the Reformed faith from deism which states that God created the world but leaves it as if it were a mere mechanism, without intervening. The second implication, that secondary or contingent causes exist, refutes the opposite extreme of deism, which is occasionalism or pantheism; the idea that God is the only agent or cause that exists.

The Confession then takes a turn towards humility regarding this doctrine, &#x27;And as to what He doth surpassing human understanding, we will not curiously inquire into it further than our capacity will admit of;&#x27; while also proclaiming the &#x27;unspeakable consolation&#x27; that it affords for believers, who may be assured that nothing befalls them by chance but by the will of their Father. This is proved by the words of Christ in : &quot;Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.&quot; Finally, the article rejects Epicureanism, an ancient philosophy which taught that the world is ultimately chaotic, and that there is no underlying order or predestination, rather that everything is subject to luck or random chance. The doctrine of providence, and its implications regarding the immanence of God in all secondary causes, and the fact that nothing can come to pass without his divine foreordination, stands in direct contradiction to Epicureanism, as it asserts that nothing is chaotic or random, but rather that everything is absolutely dependent upon the necessary will of God. Calvin gives the metaphor in the &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;, that Creation is a great theatre, in which the epic drama of human history and redemption is played out, all according to the direction of the divine will.
=== Arminian ===
At the beginning of the 17th century, the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius formulated Arminianism and disagreed with Calvin in particular on election and predestination. Arminianism is defined by God&#x27;s limited mode of providence. This mode of providence affirms the compatibility between human free will and divine foreknowledge, but its incompatibility with theological determinism. Thus predestination in Arminianism is based on divine foreknowledge, unlike in Calvinism. It is therefore a predestination by foreknowledge. From this perspective, comes the notion of a conditional election on the one who wills to have faith in God for salvation.

===Swedenborgian===

&quot;Divine Providence&quot; is a book published by Emanuel Swedenborg in 1764 which describes his systematic theology regarding providence, free will, theodicy, and other related topics. Both meanings of providence are applicable in Swedenborg&#x27;s theology, in that providence encompasses understanding, intent and action. Divine providence relative to man is &#x27;foresight&#x27;, and relative to the Lord is &#x27;providence&#x27;. Swedenborg proposes that one law of divine providence is that man should act from freedom according to reason, and that man is regenerated according to the faculties of rationality and liberty.

===Latter Day Saint (LDS)===
There is little theological literature on the term &quot;providence&quot; in LDS studies. As stated above, Reformed theology relates these terms to predestination, which does have more prominence in LDS theology, if only as a polemical term.

One particular text that could be interpreted as being related to such terms is in the Book of Abraham. As Abraham is shown the heavens, he is also shown the pre-mortal spirits of mankind:
The &quot;making of rulers&quot; above is explained as foreordination (in the chapter summary) as opposed to &quot;predestination&quot;.

This differentiation balances free will (or free agency in LDS theology) against divine intervention. LDS scholar Richard Draper has described the church&#x27;s position thus:
However, this does not imply a passive God. LDS theology favours a more active, interventionist God. In a General Conference, Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles articulates this: &quot;Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another&quot;. Rasband continues by citing a well-known text from in the Book of Mormon in which Nephi finds his nemesis unconscious from inebriation in front of him, he concludes, &quot;Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by &#x27;divine design&#x27;?&quot; Although the text itself limits the interaction of the divine to the &quot;Spirit&quot; to commanding Nephi to &quot;Slay him.&quot;

God also limits his involvement. Rasband interprets one particular passage from the Book of Mormon as saying that God (through his Spirit) will only intervene based on righteousness. Rasband concludes that, &quot;When we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father&#x27;s &#x27;divine design&#x27;.&quot;

===Islam===
When Moses () and Aaron () arrive in the court of Pharaoh, the Pharaoh begins questioning Musa about the God he follows. The Quran narrates Musa, answering the Pharaoh:

==Text of Scripture==
Those who believe in the inerrancy of the original biblical manuscripts often accompany this belief with a statement about how the biblical text has been preserved so that what we have today is at least substantially similar to what was written. That is, just as God &quot;divinely inspired the text&quot;, so he has also &quot;divinely preserved it throughout the centuries&quot;. The Westminster Confession of Faith states that the Scriptures, &quot;being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical.&quot;

This is an important argument in the &quot;King James only&quot; debates. Edward F. Hills argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed must be the closest text to the Greek autographs.

== Politics ==
In the United States Declaration of Independence, it is cited, &quot;with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our Sacred Honor&quot;.

<text>The Army Air Corps (AAC) is the aviation arm of the British Army, first formed in 1942 during the Second World War by grouping the various airborne units of the British Army. Today, there are eight regiments (seven Regular Army and one Reserve) of the AAC, as well as two independent flights and two independent squadrons deployed in support of British Army operations around the world. Regiments and flights are located in the United Kingdom, Kenya, and Canada. Some AAC squadrons provide the air assault elements of 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team, through Joint Aviation Command.

==History==

===Precursors===

The British Army first took to the sky during the 19th century with the use of observation balloons. In 1911 the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers was the first heavier-than-air British military aviation unit. The following year, the battalion was expanded into the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps which saw action throughout most of the First World War until 1 April 1918, when it was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force. Between the wars, the army used RAF co-operation squadrons. At the beginning of the Second World War, Royal Artillery officers, with the assistance of RAF technicians, flew Auster observation aircraft under RAF-owned air observation post (AOP) squadrons. Twelve squadrons were raised, three of which belonged to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and each performed vital duties in many theatres.

===First formation: 1942–1949===

In 1942, Winston Churchill announced the establishment of a new branch of army aviation, the Army Air Corps. The corps initially comprised the Glider Pilot Regiment and the Parachute Battalions (subsequently the Parachute Regiment), Air Landing Regiments, and the air observation post squadrons. In March 1944, the SAS Regiment was added to the corps.

One of their most successful exploits during the war was the capture of the Caen canal and Orne river bridges by , which occurred on 6 June 1944, prior to the Normandy landings. Once the three gliders landed, some roughly which incurred casualties, the pilots joined the glider-borne troops (Ox &amp; Bucks Light Infantry) to act as infantry. The bridge was taken within ten minutes of the battle commencing and the men withstood numerous attempts by the Germans to re-capture the location. They were soon reinforced and relieved by soldiers from the 1st Special Service Brigade (Lord Lovat). The AAC was disbanded in 1949, with the SAS regaining independent status, while the Parachute Regiment and Glider Pilot Regiment came under the umbrella of the Glider Pilot and Parachute Corps.

===Second formation: 1957–present===
In 1957 the Glider Pilot and Parachute Corps was split, with the Parachute Regiment becoming an independent formation, while the Glider Pilot Regiment was merged with the Air Observation Squadrons of the Royal Artillery into a new unit, the Army Air Corps.

In 1958 the Saunders-Roe Skeeter 7 was introduced as the AAC&#x27;s first helicopter, it was replaced by the Aérospatiale Alouette II and Westland Scout AH.1 during the early 1960s. The de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver AL.1 was introduced during the 1960s along with the Agusta/Westland Sioux AH.1 in 1964.

From 1970, nearly every army brigade had at least one Aviation Squadron that usually numbered twelve aircraft. The main rotor aircraft during the 1970s were the Westland Scout and Bell Sioux general purpose helicopters. The Sioux was replaced from 1973 by the Westland Gazelle used for Airborne reconnaissance; initially unarmed, they were converted to carry 68mm SNEB rocket pods in 1982, during the Falklands War. The Scout was replaced from 1978 by the Westland Lynx, which was capable of carrying additional firepower in the form of door gunners.

Basic rotary flying training was carried out on the Sioux in the 1970s, on the Gazelle in the 1980s and 1990s, and is currently conducted on the Eurocopter H145/H135 through No. 1 Flying Training School RAF.

Fixed-wing types in AAC service have included the Auster AOP.6 and AOP.9 and Beaver AL.1 in observation and liaison roles. In 1989, the AAC commenced operating a number of Britten-Norman Islander aircraft for surveillance and light transport duties. The corps operated the DHC-1 Chipmunk T.10 in a training role until its replacement by the Slingsby T67 Firefly in the 1990s. The Firefly was replaced by the Grob Tutor in 2010.

==== Cold War ====
During the Cold War the majority of Army Air Corps units were based in Germany and part of the British Army of the Rhine. At the beginning of 1989 the Army Air Corps structure was as follows:

==== War on Terror ====
A further boost in the Army Air Corps&#x27; capability came in the form of the AgustaWestland Apache AH.1 attack helicopter, introduced in 2004. In 2006, British Apaches deployed to Afghanistan as part of the NATO International Security Assistance Force. In 2004, Britten-Norman Defender fixed wing aircraft were purchased for Afghanistan and Iraq.

==== End of fixed-wing flying, 2019–2021 ====
In April 2019, 651 Squadron personnel and aircraft, the Islander and Defender, were transferred from 5 Regiment to No. 1 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Wing Royal Air Force. 651 Squadron continued to operate the aircraft until they were retired from service on 30 June 2021.

==== End of aviation support to BATUS ====
In October 2021, 29 (BATUS) Flight was placed in suspended animation, with the UK no longer providing BATUS with aviation support.

==Current structure and deployment==

=== Mascot ===
The Army Air Corps adopted their first Corps Mascot – Zephyr, a bald eagle – in October 2011.

===Training===
The training of future Army Air Corps aircrew is delivered by the joint service UK Military Flying Training System. Elementary Flying Training is delivered at RAF Shawbury and Army Aviation Centre, Middle Wallop.

Training Units, Army Aviation Centre, Middle Wallop
* 7 (Training) Regiment AAC
** 671 Squadron – Juno HT1
** 673 Squadron – AH-64E Apache Conversion to type
*2 (Training) Regiment AAC
** 676 Squadron – Administration
** 668 (Training) Squadron – Groundcrew Training
* 9 Regiment AAC, RAF Shawbury | Juno HT1 (Battlefield Helicopter Wing of No. 1 Flying Training School RAF)
** 660 Squadron
** 670 Squadron – Operational Training

=== Personnel ===

The strength of the Army Air Corps is about 2,000 regular personnel, of which 500 are officers. However, the AAC draws an additional 2,600 personnel from the Royal Logistic Corps, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps. Therefore, total related Army Air Corps personnel is around 4,600.

===Aircraft===
Since 2019, the AAC solely operates rotary-wing aircraft operationally. Some fixed-wing aircraft are flown with the historic flight. The AAC uses the same designation system for aircraft as the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm. The sole fixed-wing trainer is the Grob Tutor, used for Army Flying Grading.

Circa 2023, AAC aviators fly four types of helicopter, and within each type there are usually several marks/variants which carry out different roles. Pilots train with No. 1 Flying Training School at RAF Shawbury. The school is a tri-service organisation consisting of civilian and military instructors that take the student from basic flying through to more advanced flying such as instrument flying, navigation, formation flying and captaincy. In service aircraft include the Airbus Helicopters H135 Juno, the AgustaWestland Wildcat AH.1, the Eurocopter AS365N3 Dauphin II, and the Boeing AH-64E Version 6 Apache.

In May 2023, the Royal Air Force took over the helicopter support role in Brunei and thus, the Bell 212HP AH1, previously in service, was retired.

In October 2023, the Gazelle helicopter was retired from service, after 49 years in the British Army.

In March 2024, the final Apache AH.1 was formally withdrawn from service. The AH-64E was declared &quot;operationally ready&quot; on the same day.

<text>Silicon tetrachloride or tetrachlorosilane is the inorganic compound with the formula SiCl4. It is a colorless volatile liquid that fumes in air. It is used to produce high purity silicon and silica for commercial applications. It is a part of the chlorosilane family.

==Preparation==
Silicon tetrachloride is prepared by the chlorination of various silicon compounds such as ferrosilicon, silicon carbide, or mixtures of silicon dioxide and carbon. The ferrosilicon route is most common.

In the laboratory, can be prepared by treating silicon with chlorine at :

It was first prepared by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1823.

Brine can be contaminated with silica when the production of chlorine is a byproduct of a metal refining process from metal chloride ore. In rare occurrences, the silicon dioxide in silica is converted to silicon tetrachloride when the contaminated brine is electrolyzed.

==Reactions==

===Hydrolysis and related reactions===
Like other chlorosilanes or silanes, silicon tetrachloride reacts readily with water:
:SiCl4 + 2 H2O → SiO2 + 4 HCl
The reaction can be noticed on exposure of the liquid to air, as SiCl4 vapour produces fumes as it reacts with moisture to give a cloud-like aerosol of silica and hydrochloric acid. In contrast, carbon tetrachloride is not readily hydrolyzed.

With alcohols it reacts to give orthosilicate esters:
:SiCl4 + 4 ROH → Si(OR)4 + 4 HCl

===Polysilicon chlorides===
At higher temperatures homologues of silicon tetrachloride can be prepared by the reaction:
:Si + 2 SiCl4 → Si3Cl8
In fact, the chlorination of silicon is accompanied by the formation of hexachlorodisilane Si2Cl6. A series of compounds containing up to six silicon atoms in the chain can be separated from the mixture using fractional distillation.

===Reactions with other nucleophiles===
Silicon tetrachloride is a classic electrophile in its reactivity. It forms a variety of organosilicon compounds upon treatment with Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds:
:4 RLi + SiCl4 → R4Si + 4 LiCl
Reduction with hydride reagents affords silane.

==Comparison with other SiX4 compounds==
==Uses==
Silicon tetrachloride is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of polysilicon, a hyper-pure form of silicon, since it has a boiling point convenient for purification by repeated fractional distillation. It is reduced to trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) by hydrogen gas in a hydrogenation reactor, and either directly used in the Siemens process or further reduced to silane (SiH4) and injected into a fluidized bed reactor. Silicon tetrachloride reappears in both these two processes as a by-product and is recycled in the hydrogenation reactor. Vapor phase epitaxy of reducing silicon tetrachloride with hydrogen at approximately 1250 °C was done:
: (g) + 2 (g) → Si(s) + 4 (g) at 1250°C

The produced polysilicon is used as wafers in large amounts by the photovoltaic industry for conventional solar cells made of crystalline silicon and also by the semiconductor industry.

Silicon tetrachloride can also be hydrolysed to fumed silica. High purity silicon tetrachloride is used in the manufacture of optical fibres. This grade should be free of hydrogen containing impurities like trichlorosilane. Optical fibres are made using processes like MCVD and OFD where silicon tetrachloride is oxidized to pure silica in the presence of oxygen.

As a feedstock in production of fused silica.

==Safety and environmental issues==
Pollution from the production of silicon tetrachloride has been reported in China associated with the increased demand for photovoltaic cells that has been stimulated by subsidy programs.

<doc id="415624" wikidata="Q5451655" url="?curid=415624" title="Fire screen desk">
<text>The fire screen desk (also known as a screen writing table) is a very small antique desk form meant to be placed in front of a fireplace to keep a user&#x27;s feet warm while he or she is stationary while writing. This kind of desk was very popular in prosperous homes in Europe during the 18th century and slowly disappeared during the 19th, with the gradual introduction of stoves and central heating. 

In order to keep the feet and the calves exposed to the heat from the fire, the fire screen desk usually had the form of a miniature writing table or a tiny bureau à gradin, with just a few drawers beneath the desktop. As its name indicates, it had a retractable fire screen in the back to protect the user&#x27;s relatively exposed face from too much heat from the fireplace. The screen was usually made of a pleated or straight piece of heavy fabric, supported by crossed and sliding metallic supports. Many fire screen desks still exist, but the original screens have rarely survived. The metal supports or rods which extended the screens generally have been maintained with the desk. When the bare rods are in their extended position, they form an &#x27;X shape&#x27; above the back of the desk.

A few fire screen desks had no screen per se but were simply lighter, narrower, and extremely thinner versions of the high secretary desk put on some form of permanent trestle mount. Their high form shielded the user&#x27;s face from the heat of the flames while the open trestle mount at the bottom exposed the feet. They were basically a smaller version of a French form called Secretaire en portefeuille.

The fire screen desk was often designed for use by a person of a specific gender: those designed for use by a female frequently had complex ornamentation and were generally smaller (light enough to be transported easily by a lady&#x27;s maid) than those designed for use by a male. Because of these differences, individual desks were frequently called a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s screen writing table&quot; or a &quot;lady&#x27;s screen writing table&quot;.

<doc id="415626" wikidata="Q1500043" url="?curid=415626" title="Parti Rakyat Malaysia">
<text>The Malaysian People&#x27;s Party (abbreviation: PRM; Malay: &quot;Parti Rakyat Malaysia&quot;) is a dormant political party in Malaysia. Founded on 11 November 1955 as Partai Ra&#x27;ayat, it is one of the older political parties in Malaysia and traces its pedigree to the anti-colonial movements from the pre World War II period like the Kesatuan Melayu Muda.

It was part of the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Socialist Front coalition with the Labour Party of Malaya and was a force in the late 1950s and 1960s although the coalition was eventually decimated by politically-motivated detentions. In 1965, the party renamed itself Parti Sosialis Rakyat Malaysia in keeping with its scientific socialist ideology, but this was reversed in 1989. 

A small faction of the party re-emerged to form the leadership of the Socialist Party in 1998.

Eventually, PRM merged with Parti Keadilan Nasional to form Parti Keadilan Rakyat in 2003, but was revived by a minority of its former membership in 2005. It contested in the states of Penang, Kedah and Selangor in the 2018 elections after a period of political inactivity but failed to win a single seat. It is unrepresented in the Dewan Rakyat and state legislative assemblies of Malaysia.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The founder of PRM, Ahmad Boestamam, was an activist of the leftist Kesatuan Melayu Muda (&quot;Young Malays Union&quot;; KMM). During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, he had briefly served as with the Japanese sponsored militia known as the Pembela Tanah Ayer (&quot;Defender of the Homeland&quot;) and later helped to organise co-operative communes run by the KMM.
With the capitulation of the Japanese in 1945, movements that collaborated with the Japanese like KMM likewise collapsed and the leftist Malay activists regrouped to organise various political movements, such as the Malay Nationalist Party (; PKMM) led by Burhanuddin al-Helmy, the Angkatan Pemuda Insaf (&quot;Awakened Youth Organisation; API&quot;) led by Ahmad Boestamam and the Angkatan Wanita Sedar (&quot;Cohort of Awakened Women&quot;; AWAS) led by Shamsiah Fakeh. 

Boestamam was part of the PKMM and API delegation that participated in the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in 1946 and was instrumental in keeping the Malay leftist movements out of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) that resulted out of the congress.

Growing opposition to the Malayan Union confederation led the British colonial authorities to consider an alternative constitutional framework for the country. A proposal known as the &quot;Constitutional Proposals for Malaya&quot; was developed in co-operation with UMNO and representatives of the Malay rulers. This proposal was opposed by a large segment of the non-Malay population of the country who saw it as discriminatory as well as a sizeable portion of the nationalists who saw it as delaying the self-determination and independence of Malaya.

A combination of anti-British sentiments and economic hardships saw the coalescing of the various political movements representing the Malay and non-Malay populations and eventually led to the formation of a broad coalition with the Malay movements represented in Pusat Tenaga Ra&#x27;ayat (&quot;People&#x27;s United Front;&quot; PUTERA), itself a coalition of movements like PKMM, API, AWAS and others, and the non-Malay movements represented in the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action (AMCJA), another coalition of movements such as the Malayan Indian Congress, Malayan Democratic Union, and others.

The PUTERA-AMCJA tabled an alternative proposal known as the People&#x27;s Constitutional Proposal and attempted to lobby for a Royal Commission to be formed to review the original proposals. The PUTERA-AMCJA also launched a successful nationwide hartal was organised on 20 October 1947, the same date where the constitutional proposals were due to be deliberated by the House of Commons in London.

Despite these efforts, PUTERA-AMCJA failed to overturn the decision to adopt the Constitutional Proposals which led to the formation of the Federation of Malaya on 31 January 1948. API was banned on 20 March 1948, gaining the distinction of being the first political movement in Malaya to be banned by the authorities and Boestamam was arrested on 1 July 1948. A declaration of emergency was extended nationwide on 12 July 1948 in what became the Malayan Emergency and resulted in the arrests and incarceration of many leftist and nationalist activists. Many who managed to escaped the dragnet joined the armed rebellion coordinated by the Communist Party of Malaya.

=== Foundation ===
Upon his release from incarceration in 1955, Boestamam regrouped his supporters to form Partai Ra&#x27;ayat Malaya (&quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;). The new party was inaugurated on 11 November 1955 embracing a philosophy of nationalistic social democracy focussing on the poor known as Marhaenism, a phrase coined by Sukarno. It formed a coalition with the Labour Party of Malaya (LPM) led by another PKMM veteran, Ishak Haji Muhammad, which became known as the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Socialist Front () or the Socialist Front in 1957.

Branches of PRM was formed in the neighbouring British protectorate of Brunei and the colony of Singapore in what eventually became the Brunei People&#x27;s Party and Partai Rakyat Singapore (&quot;Singapore People&#x27;s Party&quot; – not to be mistaken with the current Singapore People&#x27;s Party). Both these branches eventually disappeared from active politics by the mid 1960s with the PRB banned in 1962 as a result of the Brunei revolt and the PRS never gaining enough support in Singapore for electoral success, with its president Said Zahari being arrested under Operation Coldstore before the 1963 Singaporean general election.

=== Early successes ===
The party contested as part of the Socialist Front in both the 1959 Malayan state and federal elections and the coalition managed to capture a total of 16 state and eight federal seats.

The coalition had its strongest support in Penang and Selangor. It garnered a total of 12.91% of the popular vote in the federal election, becoming the third-largest party in parliament after the UMNO-led Alliance Party and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, which was also led by a former member of KMM and PKMM, Burhanuddin al-Helmy.

While a majority of the coalition&#x27;s elected representatives were from the Labour Party, Boestamam was elected Setapak MP and Karam Singh Veriah was elected MP for Damansara, giving PRM its only two elected MPs.

The SF further consolidated its gains in municipal elections including the City Council of Georgetown, Penang where it won 14 of the 15 seats in the Council during the 1961 Local Elections. The SF was further strengthened when the former Minister of Agriculture, Aziz Ishak, brought his National Convention Party (NCP) into the coalition.

Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s announcement for the expansion of Malaya into a larger federation known as Malaysia in 1961 galvanised the co-operation between the various Opposition parties in the Parliament. The SF found itself working on the same side as Parti Negara, the People&#x27;s Progressive Party, the United Democratic Party, and the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party, in opposing the proposal due to the perception that it was being formulated by the Alliance without the consent of the people of the territories.

=== Persecution ===
However, with the onset of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation in 1962, opposition to the new federation came to be seen as being pro-Indonesia and anti-national. Boestamam, Ishak Muhammad, Aziz Ishak, and hundreds of others were subsequently arrested under the Internal Security Act. These factors cost the SF significant losses in the 1964 general election where PRM and the NCP failed to gain any seats at all and the LPM lost a significant number of seats, ending with just two.

With most of the senior leadership and a considerable number of members arrested, the coalition suffered organisationally. Furthermore, disagreements between PRM and LPM over the country&#x27;s official language led to the coalition&#x27;s demise in 1966.

=== Radicalisation ===
The party underwent a radical change in 1965 when a group of young intellectuals led by Kassim Ahmad and Syed Husin Ali took over from Boestamam, who left the party to form Parti Marhaen Malaysia in 1968.

PRM itself was renamed Parti Sosialis Rakyat Malaysia (&quot;Malaysian People&#x27;s Socialist Party;&quot; PSRM) and it officially adopted scientific socialism as its ideology.

While an understanding was reached in 1969 between PSRM and LPM, it did not result in any cooperation between the two parties.

Its final victories as an electoral force were in the 1969 elections when PSRM won two state seats in Pahang through Dzulkifli Ismail (Ulu Kuantan) and S. Sivasubramaniam (Tanah Puteh) and one in Penang through Abdul Rahman Yunus (Balik Pulau).

However, the 1969 racial riots and the subsequent suspension of parliament meant they did not take their seats. The formation of the Barisan Nasional coalition together with the post-riot political climate meant that the party remained on the sidelines.

Other leaders were also arrested under the ISA like Syed Husin Ali in 1974 and Kassim himself in 1976. This cost the party significant organisational cohesiveness that continued to plague it right into the next decade. Leaders like Kampo Radjo, Syed Husin and Abdul Razak Ahmad helped keep the party intact over the next decade.

=== Consolidation ===
In the party&#x27;s congress in 1989, PSRM decided to revert to its previous name but retain the term &quot;Malaysia&quot;. A new leadership was also elected and Syed Husin was named party president while academic Sanusi Osman was elected secretary-general. The reversion to the name Parti Rakyat Malaysia and dropping of the socialist tag was not without controversy and a group led by Mohd Nasir Hashim left the party. This group eventually formed the core that founded the Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM).

The reorganised PRM contested the 1990 general elections as part of the Gagasan Rakyat coalition with the Democratic Action Party, Parti Melayu Semangat 46, All Malaysian Indian Progressive Front and Parti Bersatu Sabah. Although PRM failed to win any seats, it marked the beginning of the reversal of the party&#x27;s fortunes.

The Gagasan Rakyat coalition did not survive the 1995 elections after the withdrawal of PBS and the dissolution of Semangat 46. Nonetheless, this was soon followed by the Reformasi movement that saw the creation of a new coalition known as Barisan Alternatif (&quot;Alternative Front&quot;) that grouped PRM, DAP, PMIP (now known as PAS) and the newly formed Parti Keadilan Nasional (&quot;National Justice Party;&quot; KeADILan).

Prominent figures in PRM during this time included Syed Husin Ali, Abdul Razak Ahmad, Sanusi Osman, Hassan Abdul Karim, Rustam Sani, Syed Shahir Syed Mohamud and Chong Ton Sin.

PRM also gained an influx of younger members from the interest and political consciousness generated by the Reformasi movement during this period which rejuvenated the youth wing of the party. BA contested the 1999 general elections with PRM contesting three parliamentary seats in three state seats. The BA won 40.23% of the popular vote but PRM failed again to win any seats, although it did only lose one seat by a narrow margin of 8.4%.

=== Merger and revival ===
Following the 1999 general elections, KeADILan began to explore the possibility of a merger between the two parties.

At the PRM annual congress in 2002 the concept of the merger was approved with nearly 80 percent of delegates voting in support.

The two parties officially merged on 3 August 2003 becoming Parti Keadilan Rakyat (&quot;People&#x27;s Justice Party&quot;; PKR). PRM had to contest the 2004 general elections under Keadilan&#x27;s symbol as the merger had yet to be approved by the authorities.

However, the 2004 elections almost routed the BA, with the coalition losing 22 seats out of the 42 it previously held. The poor performance of the new party led some former PRM members to question the merger.

In April 2005, the dissidents convened a National Congress in Johor Bahru, taking advantage of the fact that the party had yet to be de-registered by the authorities, and elected a new executive committee led by former PRM youth leader Hassan Abdul Karim. Other PRM stalwarts who took part in resurrecting the party included academic Rohana Ariffin and former political detainee Koh Swee Yong. However, Hassan would later make a switch back to PKR in 2009 after his proposal to join the Pakatan Rakyat coalition was rejected by the party congress.

Former PRM leaders who eventually gained or sustained a degree of prominence while in PKR included Syed Husin Ali, who served two terms in the Dewan Negara, and Hassan Abdul Karim who was elected Pasir Gudang MP in 2018 and elected to a second term in 2022.

Another notable figure who made the move from PRM to PKR was Sivarasa Rasiah who was a three-term MP from 2008 to 2022 and served as deputy minister for rural development from 2018 to 2020.

Others who were in both parties were unionist Syed Shahir Syed Mohamud who was MTUC president from 2005 to 2010 and later served in the Dewan Negara from 2012 to 2015, and lawyer Latheefa Koya who was appointed as Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief in 2019.

=== Recent activity ===
PRM contested in the general elections of 2008, 2018 and 2022, without winning any federal or state legislative seats. PRM did not join the opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat (2008–2015) or its successor Pakatan Harapan (2015–present).

After Hassan returned to PKR, the position of PRM president was taken up by Dr Rohana Ariffin from 2010 to 2015. She eventually stepped down to be replaced by Ariffin Salimon.

In the lead-up to the 2018 general election, the party was joined by former DAP assemblywoman for Teratai, Jenice Lee Ying Ha, and former Kapar MP, S. Manikavasagam who had previously represented PKR. Both contested in the election but failed to win their seats.

In the 2022 general election, the party nominated 16 candidates, all of whom lost their deposits. In the aftermath of the election, the PRM central committee unanimously voted to appoint former Umno and PKR politician Mohamad Ezam Mohd Nor as deputy president of the party.

Former party president Rohana Ariffin called this &quot;tragic&quot; news and asserted: &quot;the party has shifted to the right-wing and we are seeing the demise of a left-wing party.&quot;

Ezam, a former Dewan Negara member, confirmed the party would run alone in 2023 Malaysian state elections, while stating that the party opposed both socialism and capitalism, in particular crony capitalism. It claimed both the ruling unity government and Perikatan Nasional committed corruption and theft and accused both uniracial and multiracial parties of playing divisive politics on racial and religious grounds.

=== Factional dispute ===
Following the death of Ariffin Salimon in December 2023, the party entered a period of instability with one faction headed by Ahmad Jufliz Faizal and Koh Swee Yong while another faction was headed by Rohana and Ezam. 

On 2 March 2024, the latter faction held a controversial extraordinary general meeting (EGM) which was proposed and decided by the party central committee on 28 January 2024. The EGM elected Rohana as the new party president and reelected Mohd Ezam as the party deputy president. Former Member of the Kedah State Executive Council (EXCO) Tan Chow Kang, former Member of Parliament (MP) for Kapar S. Manikavasagam and youth leader Sarah Afiqah Zainol Ariff were elected new party vice presidents. RN Raj was appointed secretary general to replace the long-serving Koh.

However, Rohana later clarified that the Registrar of Socities (RoS) did not recognise the EGM and that the committee led by Ahmad Jufliz and Koh remained the legitimate one until the party’s next AGM.

Koh and Manickavasagam were also involved in a legal tangle when Koh accused the latter of sending an insulting message with intent to incite anger and breach the peace on 4 January 2024.

He pleaded guilty in the magistrates’ court to the charge on 13 February, but on 22 March, the Shah Alam High Court set aside the conviction.

Justice Aslam Zainuddin also granted Manickavasagam a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) from a charge under Section 14 of the Minor Offences Act 1955.

In the 11 May 2024 Kuala Kubu Baharu by-election, PRM fielded Ariffin’s daughter in-law Hafizah Zainuddin. Close to the Jufliz-Koh faction, she was badly defeated in the by-election, losing her deposit as DAP’s Pang Sock Tao won comfortably. During the campaign, Hafizah denied being paid to split the Malay vote.

In September 2024, Ezam sprung another surprise by leaving PRM for Islamist party PAS.

<text>The Cape May warbler (Setophaga tigrina) is a species of New World warbler. It breeds in northern North America. Its breeding range spans all but the westernmost parts of southern Canada, the Great Lakes region, and New England. It is migratory, wintering in the West Indies. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, with two records in Britain as of October 2013. The English name refers to Cape May, New Jersey, where George Ord collected the specimen later described by Alexander Wilson. This species was not recorded again in Cape May for another 100 years, although it is now known as an uncommon migrant there.

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth,&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;tigrina&quot; is Latin for &quot;tiger-striped&quot; from &quot;tigris&quot;, &quot;tiger&quot;.

== Description ==

This bird is a small passerine and is a mid-sized New World warbler. Length can vary from , wingspan is , and body mass can range from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The adult male Cape May warbler has a brown back, yellowish rump and dark brown crown. The underparts are yellow streaked with black, giving rise to the bird&#x27;s scientific name. The throat and nape are bright yellow and the face has a striking chestnut patch framed in yellow with a black eyestripe. There is a narrow white wing bar.

Plumages of the female and immature male resemble washed-out versions of the adult male, lacking the strong head pattern. The yellowish rump, and at least indications of the white wing bar, are always present.

== Biology ==
This species is insectivorous and lays larger clutches in years when spruce budworm is abundant. It picks insects from the tips of conifer branches or flies out to catch insects. The Cape May warbler also feeds on berry juice and nectar in winter, and has, uniquely for a warbler, a tubular tongue to facilitate this behavior.

The breeding habitat of this bird is the edges of coniferous woodland. Cape May warblers nest in dense foliage near the trunk of the tree, commonly the black spruce, and lays a clutch of 4–9 eggs in a cup nest. This species can lay the largest clutch of any New World warbler, probably in response to increases in the numbers of spruce budworm during outbreaks.

The song of the Cape May warbler is a simple repetition of high &quot;tsi&quot; notes. The call is a thin &quot;sip&quot;. This bird usually sings from high perches.

<doc id="415631" wikidata="Q238397" url="?curid=415631" title="Ida Saxton McKinley">
<text>Ida McKinley (née Saxton; June 8, 1847 – May 26, 1907) was the first lady of the United States from 1897 until 1901, as the wife of President William McKinley. McKinley also served as the First Lady of Ohio from 1892 to 1896 while her husband was the governor of Ohio.

Born to a successful Ohio family, McKinley met her future husband and later married him during the early Reconstruction years. She never recovered from losing their daughters as children and remained in a fragile state of health for the rest of her life, including having seizures. During campaigns and while in office, her husband took great care to accommodate her needs, as they were a devoted couple. McKinley&#x27;s ability to fulfill the role of First Lady was nevertheless limited. She was brought further grief by the death of her brother and the assassination of her husband. McKinley reportedly visited her husband&#x27;s resting place daily until her own death.

== Early life and marriage ==
Ida Saxton was born in Canton, Ohio, the eldest child of James Saxton, a prominent Canton banker, and Katherine &quot;Kate&quot; DeWalt. Saxton&#x27;s family was one of Canton&#x27;s first pioneer families and was quite wealthy. Through his work in banking, James Saxton became the second richest man in Canton. He and Kate DeWalt raised Ida and her younger siblings, Mary and George, in the grand Saxton House. Little is known about Saxton&#x27;s early childhood. Saxton developed close lifelong relationships to her mother and her grandmother, Christiana DeWalt. This likely influenced Saxton&#x27;s later belief that close intergenerational family connections were a key part of a woman&#x27;s life. During the American Civil War, Saxton&#x27;s mother led a volunteer effort to gather supplies and sew uniforms for the Union Army. When Saxton was on break from boarding school, she helped her mother with these tasks.

===Education===
Saxton&#x27;s parents strongly believed in abolitionism and equal education for women. James Saxton was on the board of trustees of Canton&#x27;s local public schools and enlisted Betsy Mix Cowles, a prominent abolitionist and suffragette, as the principal of Canton Union School. Cowles became a close mentor to Saxton while she was a student there. From 1862 to 1863, Saxton studied at Delphi Academy in Clinton County, New York, as Cowles had moved to teach there. Delphi Academy was Saxton&#x27;s first boarding school experience and she learned accounting and finance there. However, both Cowles and Saxton left Delphi Academy due to its Confederate sympathies. Saxton later studied at the Sanford School in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1863 to 1865. At all the schools she attended, Saxton excelled in her studies, and was called &quot;an apt learner&quot; and &quot;gifted as a scholar&quot;.

Saxton attended finishing school at Brooke Hall Female Seminary from 1865 to 1868. There, she was educated in singing, piano playing, linguistics, and needlepoint, skills that would prepare her to become the household hostess. When she had time off from school, Saxton often traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to attend opera performances, classical music concerts, or theatrical plays. Saxton made many long-lasting friendships with fellow students and teachers at Brooke Hall Female Seminary, including teacher Harriet Gault. Gault believed that women should be physically active, a progressive idea for the time, inspiring Saxton to take long walks each day to improve her physical fitness.

===Career and trip to Europe===
After Saxton graduated from finishing school in 1868, her father insisted that she become an actress to help raise funds for the construction of a new Presbyterian church. That March, Saxton performed at Schaefer&#x27;s Opera House, posing in tableaus which depicted various scenes from American and European history. Her performance was well-attended, as about twelve hundred people flocked to the opera house and named Saxton &quot;best actress&quot;. Saxton also worked as a clerk at Stark County Bank, which her father owned. Saxton later worked as a cashier and managed the bank in her father&#x27;s absence. Her role in the bank was controversial and her male colleagues believed that she had received an &quot;over-education&quot;. However, Saxton defended her position at the bank, believing her father wanted her to support herself without getting married. Excluding the time she spent on Grand Tour, Saxton worked at Stark County Bank until she married William McKinley in 1871. When Saxton was not working or traveling, she taught Sunday school at the First Presbyterian Church, the same church her grandfather John Saxton helped establish.

From June to December 1869, Ida Saxton and her younger sister Mary took a Grand Tour of Europe chaperoned by Janette Alexander, using the trip as an opportunity to finish their education. The group travelled throughout Europe, visiting Ireland, Scotland, England, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. Saxton visited many art museums and met sculptor Vinnie Ream, who later became famous for her statue of Abraham Lincoln in Paris. Saxton also met a limbless painter named Charles Felir in Amsterdam who painted with his mouth. According to the National First Ladies&#x27; Library, &quot;[The artist&#x27;s] example seems to have inspired her to later insist on living a full public life despite disabilities she developed [later in life].&quot; When the group was in Italy, Alexander arranged for Ida and Mary to meet Pope Pius IX. Although Saxton disliked Roman Catholicism because she thought that &quot;the form and ceremony was too much&quot;, she &quot;bowed before [the Pope] and kissed his hand&quot; because she thought he was &quot;such a nice old man&quot;. Ida and Mary continued the habit of hiking daily to maintain physical health, hiking throughout the Swiss Alps. Saxton&#x27;s travels also influenced her social outlook and made her aware of her privileged position, as she witnessed working-class women perform physical labor for little pay. One such example was when she travelled to Belgium and saw lace workers create lace in poor conditions. Saxton decided to purchase a lot of their work to support the lace workers and spent her entire life developing a collection of Belgian lace.

==Marriage and family==
While Saxton was working at Stark County Bank, she met William McKinley for the first time in 1868 at a picnic at Meyers Lake, Ohio, about two miles from Canton. McKinley was visiting his sister Anna when he developed an acquaintance with Saxton. At this time, Saxton was engaged to Confederate Army veteran John Wright. However, John Wright suddenly died of brain inflammation (most likely meningitis) while Ida was in Europe. After her Grand Tour, Ida was approached by many suitors, but she turned down their offers of marriage. 

In 1870, Saxton began seriously courting McKinley after he introduced her to Horace Greeley at a lecture. At this time, Saxton was courting other men but was impressed by his moral character. The two often conversed while performing bank transactions, at friends&#x27; homes, or while traveling to teach Sunday school at Saxton&#x27;s Presbyterian church and McKinley&#x27;s Methodist church. McKinley also represented the Saxton family in court, winning claims for them. Although Saxton&#x27;s father encouraged her to court McKinley, Saxton asserted that she was not influenced by her father to accept McKinley&#x27;s marriage proposal. On January 25, 1871, Ida Saxton, aged 23, married William McKinley, aged 27, at the newly built First Presbyterian Church in Canton in a joint Methodist-Presbyterian service. The service was attended by one thousand people, as Ida was considered the belle of Canton. Following the wedding, performed by the Reverend E. Buckingham and the Reverend Dr. Endsley, the couple attended a reception at the home of the bride&#x27;s parents and then secretly travelled to New York for their honeymoon.

=== Children and development of illness ===

After their honeymoon, William and Ida McKinley returned to Canton and lived in St. Cloud Hotel for a time until Ida&#x27;s father bought them a small house on North Market and Elizabeth Street. The first two years of marriage were reportedly happy and Ida affectionately called William &quot;major&quot; in public and &quot;dearest&quot; in private. The McKinleys&#x27; first child Katie was born on Christmas Day 1871, while William was still a lawyer in Canton. She was adored by her parents, becoming the center of the household. Katie was smothered with love by Ida, getting both her photograph taken and an oil painting done. After Katie&#x27;s birth, Ida returned to her busy social life, making numerous public appearances with William. Ida also joined William&#x27;s Methodist church and Katie was baptized.

McKinley became pregnant again shortly thereafter. During this time, her mother began developing cancer and died on March 20, about two weeks before McKinley gave birth. At her mother&#x27;s burial, McKinley fell while stepping into or out of a carriage, striking her head. This likely caused her to develop epilepsy and phlebitis. In the spring of 1873, McKinley gave birth to a sickly infant also named Ida following a very difficult delivery, and the baby died four months later of cholera on August 20. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony believes because Ida became immunocompromised during her second pregnancy, she gave birth to a sickly daughter.

McKinley was grief-stricken, and she believed that God punished her by killing her daughter. She was deeply affected by this and desperately feared the loss of her firstborn child. Among the many ailments she developed, her walking ability was impaired and she lost strength in her dominant hand. Dr. Whitney, her father&#x27;s physician, cared for McKinley&#x27;s maladies and ordered complete rest. Unable to care for Katie and be separated from her father, the McKinleys moved into the Saxton House for six months and Ida&#x27;s sister Mary took care of Katie. McKinley spent hours a day in a darkened room with Katie in her arms, kissing her and weeping. She would not let Katie leave her sight unless William took her for a drive. William&#x27;s brother, Abner, once found Katie swinging on a gate of the garden of her house and invited her to go for a walk with him. The child replied that &quot;if [she] would go out of the yard, God would punish [her] mama some more.&quot; In June 1875, Katie became ill and died of heart disease on June 25.

After Katie died, McKinley was plunged into a state of deep depression and she prayed for her own death. She ate very little food and her seizures worsened. William did everything in his power to retain her &quot;interest in existence&quot;, offering to sacrifice his political ambitions for her well-being. Ida clung tightly to William, commissioning a painting of him and hanging it on the wall across from her bed. Ida stopped going to church, believing that God had abandoned her. In the early 1890s, she started believing in reincarnation and became interested in Eastern religions after attending a lecture on the subject, hoping that she would meet her daughters again. When she saw little girls, she stared intently at them, hoping one of her children had come back. Ida made every effort to preserve her children&#x27;s memory, hanging the picture of Katie on her wall as well as preserving her clothes and rocking chair.

== Illness ==
Possessed of a fragile, nervous temperament due to the loss of her mother and two young daughters within a short span of time, Mrs. McKinley broke down. She developed epilepsy and became totally dependent on her husband. Her seizures at times occurred in public; she had a seizure at McKinley&#x27;s inaugural ball as Governor of Ohio. Although she battled her illness for the rest of her life, she kept busy with her hobby, crocheting slippers, making gifts of thousands of pairs to friends, acquaintances and charities, which would auction pairs for large sums. For her condition, she often took barbiturates, laudanum, and other common sedatives of the time.

== First Lady of the United States ==

President McKinley took great care to accommodate her condition. In a break with tradition, he insisted that his wife be seated next to him at state dinners rather than at the other end of the table. At receiving lines, she alone remained seated. Many of the social chores normally assumed by the First Lady fell to Mrs. Jennie Tuttle Hobart, wife of Vice President Garret Hobart. Guests noted that whenever Mrs. McKinley was about to undergo a seizure, the President would gently place a napkin or handkerchief over her face to conceal her contorted features. When it passed, he would remove it and resume whatever he was doing as if nothing had happened.
The First Lady often traveled with the President. McKinley traveled to California with the President in May 1901, but became so ill in San Francisco that the planned tour of the Northwest was cancelled. She also accompanied the President on his trip to Buffalo, New York in September of that year when he was assassinated, but was not present at the shooting.
On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was shot in Buffalo, New York in the stomach by a 28-year-old anarchist named Leon Czolgosz. Doctors were unable to locate the bullet. The President&#x27;s wound eventually became infected with gangrene. He died eight days after the shooting, aged 58. Relatives and friends gathered around his death bed. The first lady sobbed over him, saying, &quot;I want to go, too. I want to go, too.&quot; Her husband replied, &quot;We are all going, we are all going. God&#x27;s will be done, not ours&quot;, and with final strength put an arm around her. He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;, although some other accounts have the first lady singing it softly to him.

==Later life and death==

With the death of her husband, Mrs. McKinley lost much of her will to live. Although she bore up well in the days between the shooting and the president&#x27;s death, she could not bring herself to attend his funeral. Her health eroded as she withdrew to the safety of her home and memories in Canton. She was cared for by her younger sister. The President was interred at the Werts Receiving Vault at West Lawn Cemetery until his memorial was built. Ida visited daily until her own death. She survived the president by less than six years, dying on May 26, 1907, aged 59. She was buried next to him and their two deceased daughters in Canton&#x27;s McKinley Memorial Mausoleum.

==Murder of brother George Saxton==
Three years before the assassination of her husband, Ida McKinley&#x27;s only brother, George DeWalt Saxton (1850–1898), was murdered. Dressmaker Mrs. Anna &quot;Annie&quot; E. Ehrhart George was accused of the murder, then tried 2–24 April 1899.

Following nine years of wooing Mrs. George, and six more years indulging in their affair, Saxton had then requested and financed his lover&#x27;s divorce from her husband, Sample C. George—who had, in 1892, sued Saxton in the Supreme Court for alienation of affections, settling for $1,850 plus legal costs (after quietly remarrying Lucy Graham)—but George Saxton later spurned his conquest. Failing to successfully sue Saxton for breach of promise, the former Mrs. George was accused of fatally shooting him as he approached the home of another woman—an act she had repeatedly threatened.

Neither the Saxtons nor the McKinley family attended the trial. The media championed her case; Mrs. George claimed self-defense and was acquitted of first-degree murder by a jury. No one else was ever charged with the crime. Mrs. George later married Dr. Arthur Cornelius Ridout, reputedly an alcoholic and a gambler, whose death by hanging from a chandelier was ruled a suicide.

== Legacy ==

McKinley&#x27;s childhood home, the Saxton House, has been preserved on Market Avenue in Canton. In addition to growing up in the house, she and her husband also lived there from 1878 to 1891, the period during which the future President McKinley served as one of Ohio&#x27;s Congressional Representatives. The house was restored to its Victorian splendor and became part of the First Ladies National Historic Site at its dedication in 1998.

<text>James Martin Pacelli McGuinness (; 23 May 1950 – 21 March 2017) was an Irish republican politician and statesman for Sinn Féin and a leader within the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during The Troubles. He was the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland from May 2007 to January 2017.

McGuinness served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Ulster from 1997 until his resignation in 2013. Like all Sinn Féin MPs, McGuinness followed abstentionism in the Westminster Parliament. Working alongside US Special Envoy George Mitchell, McGuinness was also one of the main architects of the Good Friday Agreement which formally cemented the Northern Ireland peace process and established the Northern Ireland Assembly.

In 1998, McGuinness was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Mid Ulster. He served as Minister of Education in the Northern Ireland Executive under First Minister David Trimble from 1999 to 2002. Following the St Andrews Agreement and the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he became deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland on 8 May 2007, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley becoming First Minister. In 2008 and 2016, he was reappointed as deputy First Minister to serve alongside Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster, respectively. He was Sinn Féin&#x27;s candidate for President of Ireland in the 2011 Irish presidential election.

In the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election, McGuinness was elected as the MLA for Foyle. On 9 January 2017, McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. He announced on 19 January that he would not be standing for re-election in the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election due to ill health. He reportedly suffered from amyloidosis, a condition that attacks the vital organs, and retired shortly before his death on 21 March 2017, aged 66.

== IRA ==
McGuinness acknowledged that he was a former IRA member, but stated that he left the IRA in 1974. He originally joined the Official IRA, unaware of the split at the December 1969 Army Convention, switching to the Provisional IRA soon after. By the start of 1972, at the age of 21, he was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry, a position he held at the time of Bloody Sunday on 30 January 1972, when thirteen civilians were shot and killed in the city by British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment during a civil rights march, with a fourteenth victim dying four months later.

During the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward stated he had been the leader of the Fianna, the youth wing of the IRA at the time of Bloody Sunday. He said that McGuinness and an anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts that morning. He said that his organisation intended to attack city centre premises in Derry on the same day. In response, McGuinness said the statements were &quot;fantasy&quot;, while Gearóid Ó hEára (formerly Gerry O&#x27;Hara), a Derry Sinn Féin councillor, stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.

The inquiry concluded that, although McGuinness was &quot;engaged in paramilitary activity&quot; at the time of Bloody Sunday and had probably been armed with a Thompson submachine gun, there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were &quot;sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire&quot;.

McGuinness negotiated alongside Gerry Adams with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Willie Whitelaw, in 1972. In 1973, he was convicted by the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Special Criminal Court, after being arrested near a car containing of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment. In court, he declared his membership of the Provisional IRA without equivocation: &quot;We have fought against the killing of our people... I am a member of Óglaigh na hÉireann and very, very proud of it&quot;.

After his release, and another conviction in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership in 1974, he became increasingly prominent in Sinn Féin, the political wing of the republican movement. He was in indirect contact with British intelligence during the 1981 hunger strikes, and again in the early 1990s. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont in 1982, representing Londonderry. He was the second candidate elected after Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume. As with all elected members of Sinn Féin and the SDLP, he did not take up his seat. On 9 December 1982, McGuinness, Gerry Adams and Danny Morrison were banned from entering Great Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Act by the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw.

In August 1993, he was the subject of a two-part special by &quot;The Cook Report&quot;, a Central TV investigative documentary series presented by Roger Cook. It accused him of continuing involvement in IRA activity, of attending an interrogation and of encouraging Frank Hegarty, a British informer, to return to Derry from a safe house in England. Hegarty&#x27;s mother Rose appeared on the programme to tell of telephone calls to McGuinness and of Hegarty&#x27;s subsequent murder. McGuinness denied her account and denounced the programme saying &quot;I have never been in the IRA. I don&#x27;t have any sway over the IRA&quot;.

In 2005, Michael McDowell, the Irish Tánaiste, stated McGuinness, along with Gerry Adams and Martin Ferris, were members of the seven-man IRA Army Council. McGuinness denied this, saying he was no longer an IRA member. Experienced Troubles journalist Peter Taylor presented further apparent evidence of McGuinness&#x27;s role in the IRA in his documentary &quot;Age of Terror&quot;, shown in April 2008. In his documentary, Taylor alleges that McGuinness was the head of the IRA&#x27;s Northern Command and had advance knowledge of the IRA&#x27;s 1987 Remembrance Day bombing, which left 12 people dead.

== Chief negotiator and Minister of Education ==
He became Sinn Féin&#x27;s chief negotiator in the Northern Ireland peace process negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement. At the time of his death, former US President Bill Clinton noted that McGuinness was the one who personally oversaw the agreement&#x27;s arms decommissioning phase. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also acknowledged the leading role which McGuinness had in ensuring the agreement would be enforced.

He was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996 representing Foyle. Having contested Foyle unsuccessfully at the 1983, 1987 and 1992 Westminster elections, he became MP for Mid Ulster in 1997 and after the agreement was concluded, was returned as a member of the Assembly for the same constituency. He was nominated by his party for a ministerial position in the power-sharing executive, where he became Minister of Education. One of his acts as Minister of Education was his decision to scrap the 11-plus exam, which he had failed as a child. He was re-elected to the Westminster Parliament in 2001, 2005 and 2010.

In May 2003, transcripts of telephone calls between McGuinness and British officials including Mo Mowlam, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair&#x27;s Chief of Staff, were published in a biography of McGuinness entitled &quot;From Guns to Government&quot; by Kathryn Johnston and Liam Clarke. The tapes had been made by MI5 and the authors of the book were arrested under the Official Secrets Act. The conversations showed an easy and friendly relationship between McGuinness and Powell. He joked with Powell about unionist MPs while Mowlam referred to him as &quot;babe&quot; and discussed her difficulties with Blair. In another transcript, he praised Bill Clinton to Gerry Adams.

== St Andrews Agreement and deputy First Minister ==

In the weeks following the St Andrews Agreement, the four biggest parties—the DUP, Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP—indicated their choice of ministries in the Executive and nominated members to fill them. The Assembly convened on 8 May 2007 and Paisley and McGuinness were nominated as First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively.

On 12 May Sinn Féin agreed to take up three places on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and nominated three MLAs to take them.

On 8 December 2007, while visiting President of the United States George W. Bush in the White House with the Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, McGuinness said to the press, &quot;Up until the 26 March this year, Ian Paisley and I never had a conversation about anything—not even about the weather—and now we have worked very closely together over the last seven months and there&#x27;s been no angry words between us... This shows we are set for a new course.&quot;

== 2011 Irish presidential campaign ==

On 16 September 2011 McGuinness was announced as the Sinn Féin candidate in the 2011 Irish presidential election. In the election held on 27 October 2011, McGuinness received 243,030 first preference votes, placing third behind Michael D. Higgins (elected president) and Seán Gallagher. McGuinness had earned endorsements from Colm Meaney, Roma Downey, and Fionnula Flanagan among others; and had performed well considering Sinn Féin&#x27;s position in the Republic at that time. 

McGuinness was the only candidate ineligible to vote in the election as, although an Irish citizen, he was not ordinarily a resident in the Republic of Ireland. Following the election, McGuinness formally returned to the role of deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland on 31 October.

== Resignation from the House of Commons ==
On 30 December 2012 McGuinness announced that he had formally resigned as the MP for Mid-Ulster stating &quot;I have served formal notice of my resignation from the position of MP for Mid-Ulster with immediate effect. This is in line with my party&#x27;s commitment to end double jobbing.&quot; To do this, he was made Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 2 January 2013 by Chancellor George Osborne, making him an employee of the Crown and thus ineligible for membership of the House of Commons.

== Resignation as deputy First Minister ==
In November 2016, a scandal came to light surrounding the Renewable Heat Incentive, an energy incentive championed by Arlene Foster when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Incentives in 2012. The incentive would cost the Northern Ireland Executive £480m over 20 years, and was marred by allegations of fraud, which were not acknowledged or acted upon by Foster or the DUP (McGuinness&#x27; and Sinn Féin&#x27;s partner in government). McGuinness and others in Sinn Féin called for Foster to step aside as First Minister to allow for independent inquiries, but she refused. She made a statement before the assembly on 19 December without McGuinness&#x27; approval (as required under the power-sharing agreement), resulting in Sinn Féin and the opposition parties all walking out of the assembly.

Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams indicated on 8 January 2017 that McGuinness could resign, thus vacating both his and Foster&#x27;s offices, if Foster did not agree to temporarily step aside to allow an independent inquiry. McGuinness resigned the following day; in his statements to the press, he said &quot;Today is the right time to call a halt to the DUP&#x27;s arrogance&quot;, and said that Foster had a &quot;clear conflict of interest&quot; in the affair. Another reason cited for his resignation was the decision by DUP Minister for Communities Paul Givan to remove £50,000 in funding from the Líofa Gaeltacht Bursary scheme, a yearly programme that allowed 100 school-age children to travel to the Donegal Gaeltacht to learn the Irish language. Sinn Féin refused to nominate a successor to McGuinness before 16 January, resulting in the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, calling for new elections scheduled for 2 March. McGuinness subsequently announced that he would not run for re-election, due to ill health.

== Personal life ==
McGuinness&#x27;s mother was from Donegal in the northwest of Ireland. She moved to Derry to work in a shirt factory. It was in Derry that she met McGuinness&#x27;s father.

One of McGuinness&#x27;s middle names, Pacelli, is after Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli).

McGuinness attended St. Eugene&#x27;s Primary School and later the Christian Brothers technical college, leaving school at the age of 15.

McGuinness married Bernadette Canning in 1974; they had four children, two girls and two boys. He was a fan of the Derry Gaelic football and hurling teams and played both sports when he was younger. He grew up just 50 metres from Celtic Park, the home of Derry&#x27;s Gaelic Athletic Association. His older brother Tom played Gaelic football for Derry. He supported Derry City F.C. where his younger brother Paul played for the Candystripes.

McGuinness supported Manchester United from the age of eight. McGuinness also had an interest in cricket – sometimes extending his support to the England cricket team, as well as that of Ireland.

In March 2019, McGuinness was posthumously awarded a certificate of honour by mayor of San Francisco London Breed for his &quot;courageous service in the military.&quot; The nomination had been made by the United Irish Societies who had appointed him honorary marshal in the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade. Breed apologised two days later following controversy.

==Health concerns and death==

In December 2016, McGuinness was advised against making a planned visit to China on medical grounds, initially announcing that this was due to &quot;unforeseen personal circumstances.&quot; After subsequent tests, he was told that he was suffering from &quot;a very serious illness.&quot; McGuinness and Sinn Féin declined to give details of his illness to the media. In January 2017, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; disclosed that McGuinness was suffering from amyloidosis, a rare incurable disease that affects organs. McGuinness complained that the &quot;Times&quot; had breached his privacy and that the paper had inaccurately reported the condition as genetic, thereby causing distress to his family.

On 6 March 2017, McGuinness was hospitalised at Derry&#x27;s Altnagelvin Area Hospital due to ill health. He died on 21 March, at the age of 66.

<text>Bernard Alexander Montgomery Grant (17 February 1944 – 8 April 2000) was a British politician who was the Member of Parliament for Tottenham, London, from 1987 to his death in 2000. He was a member of the Labour Party.

== Biography ==
=== Early years and education ===
Bernie Grant was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, to schoolteacher parents, who in 1963 took up the UK Government&#x27;s offer to people from the crown colonies to settle in the United Kingdom. In the UK, Grant attended Tottenham Technical College, and went on to take a degree course in Mining Engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, but did not graduate.

=== Political career ===
In the mid-1960s, he was, for a period, a member of the Socialist Labour League, led by Gerry Healy. This later became known as the Workers Revolutionary Party. He quickly became a trade union official, and moved into politics, becoming a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Haringey in 1978.

When the Conservative government introduced &quot;rate capping&quot;, Grant led the rate-capping rebellion in the borough in 1984. This created division in the local Constituency Labour Party, but through this split, Grant became the Borough of Haringey leader in 1985.

Grant was associated with the Socialist Campaign Group, and spoke out against police racism.

As council leader during the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot, in which policeman PC Keith Blakelock was murdered, Grant was brought to national attention when he gave a speech outside Tottenham Town Hall, in which he was widely misquoted as saying &quot;The police were to blame for what happened on Sunday night and what they got was a bloody good hiding&quot; – his actual words were &quot;the youth think they gave the police a bloody good hiding&quot;. His comments brought swift denunciation from the Labour Party leadership, and the then Conservative Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, called him &quot;the high priest of conflict&quot;; several British newspapers also dubbed him &quot;Barmy Bernie&quot;. Grant claimed that he was merely explaining to a wider audience what the feeling on the estate was like. He claimed his words had been taken out of context, but offered an apology to the family of PC Blakelock. There is conflicting information over whether Grant condemned the violence of the rioters the following day. To some, Grant was an extremist, yet he supported the prosecution of 45 people subsequently charged with riot and affray.

The controversy did not prevent him from being elected as MP for Tottenham at the 1987 general election, one of the UK&#x27;s first Black British MPs since the Liberal Peter McLagan in the 19th century, all of them members of the Labour Party Black Sections movement, being elected at the same time as Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng, as well as Britain&#x27;s first British Asian MP since the 1920s, Keith Vaz. Grant later stood for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, but was unsuccessful.

In 1989, he established and chaired the Parliamentary Black Caucus, modelled after the Congressional Black Caucus of the United States. The organisation was committed to advancing the opportunities of Britain&#x27;s ethnic minority communities.

=== African Reparations Movement ===
In 1993, Grant co-founded and chaired the African Reparations Movement (ARM UK) to campaign for the movement for reparations for slavery and racism. ARM UK was formed following the 1993 Abuja Proclamation declared at the First Pan-African Conference on Reparations, in Abuja, Nigeria, convened by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Nigerian government. On 10 May 1993 Grant tabled a motion in the House of Commons that the House welcomed the proclamation and &quot;calls upon the international community to recognise that the unprecedented moral debt owed to African people has yet to be paid, and urges all those countries who were enriched by enslavement and colonisation to review the case for reparations to be paid to Africa and to Africans in the Diaspora; acknowledges the continuing painful economic and personal consequences of the exploitation of Africa and Africans in the Diaspora and the racism it has generated; and supports the OAU as it intensifies its efforts to pursue the cause of reparations.&quot; The motion was sponsored by Grant, Tony Benn, Tony Banks, John Austin-Walker, Harry Barnes, and Gerry Bermingham; an additional 46 Labour Party MPs signed to support the motion, including Jeremy Corbyn. ARM UK, in a &quot;Birmingham Declaration&quot; of 1 January 1994, called upon:

Grant&#x27;s approach to reparations included demands for the return of looted African cultural heritage (such as the Benin Bronzes) and that the British government should financially support those who wanted to return to their country of origin.

=== Personal life and death ===
Grant married three times, living with his third wife in Muswell Hill. He was diabetic since his thirties. He died from a heart attack at Middlesex Hospital on 8 April 2000, aged 56. His funeral procession on 18 April passed through Tottenham towards a service at Alexandra Palace, pausing as it passed the Broadwater Farm estate. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s report, &quot;An estimated 3,000 people... turned out to salute the black radical. There were dancers and singers, a Highland piper and African drums. Also present were Home Secretary, Jack Straw, Chris Smith, Culture Secretary, Clare Short, Minister for International Development, and Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz, Britain&#x27;s most senior BAME ministers.&quot;

==Legacy==
Grant&#x27;s widow, Sharon, was on the shortlist to succeed him as the official Labour candidate for Tottenham, but was beaten by the 27-year-old David Lammy, who won the by-election in June 2000.

In September 2007, in Tottenham, Haringey Council opened the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in his name. On Sunday, 28 October 2012, a blue plaque, organised by the Nubian Jak Community Trust, was unveiled at Tottenham Old Town Hall in tribute to Grant. On 5 December 2017, a portrait of Grant was unveiled in Parliament. The portrait was commissioned by the Speaker&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Works of Art. Drawn in 180 hours using pencil and charcoal by hyper-realist artist Kelvin Okafor, the portrait joined the Parliamentary Art Collection.

In March 2019, the Labour Party launched the Bernie Grant Leadership programme, which was created to train and equip BAME Labour members. Dawn Butler wrote on the launch that &quot;This national programme is about empowering more Black, Asian, minority ethnic members to take on leadership positions in the Labour Party, develop skills and join a network of talented members and community activists across the country&quot;, saying that Grant &quot;campaigned tirelessly for the elimination of racism both in Britain and across the world. ... He was a champion of his community, a dedicated constituency MP and has encouraged a generation of BAME leaders.&quot;

Grant&#x27;s archive is held at the Bishopsgate Institute. Much of Grant&#x27;s life work and community contributions can be found in articles, newspaper clippings at the archives of the George Padmore Institute, an organisation committed to preserving the cultural contributions of Caribbean, African and Asian descent in Britain and Europe.

Gould returned to New Zealand and in 2004 was made a director at TVNZ.

==Early life and family==
Gould was born in Hāwera, New Zealand, on 11 February 1939, the son of Charles Terence Gould and Elsie Gladys May Gould (née Driller). He was educated at Tauranga College from 1951 to 1953, and then Dannevirke High School between 1954 and 1955. He went on to study at Victoria University College from 1956 to 1958, and Auckland University College from 1959 to 1962, graduating BA LLB in 1961, and LLM with first-class honours two years later. He was a New Zealand Rhodes Scholar to Balliol College, Oxford, from 1962. After completing a degree in Law with first-class honours, he joined the British Diplomatic Service in 1964. He then returned to Oxford as a tutorial Fellow in Law at Worcester College alongside Francis Reynolds.

Gould&#x27;s brother is Wayne Gould, best known for popularising Sudoku. They are descendants of George Gould, a former chairman of the New Zealand Shipping Company. In 1967, Bryan Gould married Gillian Anne Harrigan, and the couple went on to have two children.

==Parliamentary career==
Having fought the seat unsuccessfully in February 1974, Gould was elected Labour MP for Southampton Test in October 1974 and held it until 1979. He worked as a television journalist from 1979 to 1983, and was then elected as MP for Dagenham from 1983, holding the seat until he resigned on 17 May 1994.

Gould was a member of Neil Kinnock&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet, serving first as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, then as spokesman on Trade and Industry, the Environment, and later on Heritage. In 1992 he founded the Full Employment Forum. Later that year he was defeated in the leadership election to succeed Kinnock after the general election, which Labour had lost to the Conservative Party for the fourth election in succession. John Smith won the leadership contest, but Gould resigned from Smith&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet on 27 September 1992 when the Shadow Cabinet rejected a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and in protest against Labour&#x27;s support for the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. He resigned his parliamentary seat in May 1994 when he was about to return to New Zealand.

==After Parliament==
In July 1994, Gould returned to New Zealand and became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waikato, serving until his retirement in 2004. In this position, Gould was instrumental in initiating The Great Race, a rowing race for Waikato University against international universities on the Waikato River. The &quot;Bryan Gould Cup&quot; for the women&#x27;s eights race is named after him.

In the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Gould was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to tertiary education. In October 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Waikato. He is a board member of TVNZ.

<text>George Robert Cryer (3 December 1934 – 12 April 1994) was an English Labour Party politician from Yorkshire. He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Keighley from 1974 until his defeat in 1983. He then served as the Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Sheffield from 1984 to 1989, and returned to the Commons as MP for Bradford South from 1987 until his death in 1994.

He was one of the founders of the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway.

==Early life==
Born in Bradford, Cryer was educated at Salt High School, Shipley, and the University of Hull. He worked as a teacher and lecturer.

After British Railways closed the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway line in 1962, Cryer was one of a group of people who formed the KWVR Preservation Society, which bought the line and reopened it. As the society&#x27;s first chairman, he helped to facilitate the shooting of the film &quot;The Railway Children&quot; on the line in the summer of 1970 and had a small part in it, as a guard.

==Political career==
Cryer first stood for Parliament at Darwen in 1964, but was defeated by the incumbent Conservative MP, Charles Fletcher-Cooke.

He was elected the Labour Member of Parliament for Keighley from 1974 to 1983 and represented Bradford South from 1987 until his death in a road traffic accident on 12 April 1994 when he was 59. He was the MEP for Sheffield from 1984 until 1989.

At the start of the Queen&#x27;s Speech debate on 21 November 1989 – the first time the House of Commons was televised – Cryer raised a point of order on the subject of access to the House, thereby denying the Conservative MP Ian Gow, who was to move the Loyal Address to the Speech from the Throne, the accolade of being the first MP (other than the Speaker, Bernard Weatherill) to speak in the Commons on television.

Cryer served on the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute. 

==Death==
Cryer died in a car accident on 12 April 1994 when the Rover he was driving to London overturned on the M1 motorway near Junction 5 at Watford. His wife Ann survived the crash.

==Family==
His wife Ann Cryer was MP for Keighley between 1997 and 2010, and their son John Cryer was the MP for Leyton and Wanstead.

On several episodes of Radio 4&#x27;s political programme &quot;The Westminster Hour&quot;, Brandreth has shared his thoughts on how to make the most of being a government minister. From 2003 to 2005 Brandreth hosted the Radio 4 comedy panel game &quot;Whispers&quot;.

In 2006, Brandreth appeared in the Radio 4 comedy programme &quot;Living with the Enemy&quot; which he co-wrote with comedian Nick Revell, in which they appear as a former Conservative government minister and a former comedian. In 2010 he broadcast a Radio 4 documentary about his great-great-great-grandfather, Benjamin Brandreth, the inventor of a medicine called &quot;Brandreth&#x27;s Pills&quot;.

The podcast discussed aspects of the English language such as historic or unusual words and their origins, as well as the origins of popular phrases and sayings. The podcast ended in July 2024.

In September 2023, Brandreth began hosting another podcast, called &quot;Rosebud with Gyles Brandreth&quot;, where he interviews famous people about &quot;their first memories and first experiences&quot;. Interviewees include Judi Dench, Björn Ulvaeus, Miriam Margolyes and Keir Starmer.

==Writing==

Since the 1970s, Brandreth has written books for adults and children about Scrabble, words, puzzles and jokes, and was a regular contributor to &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot; magazine. He wrote an authorised biography of actor John Gielgud, and lipogrammic reworks of Shakespeare. In the 1980s, Brandreth wrote scripts for &quot;Dear Ladies&quot;, a television programme featuring Hinge and Bracket. Brandreth created the stage show &quot;Zipp!&quot;, which enjoyed success at the Edinburgh Festival and had a short run in the West End.

In 1999, he published diaries chronicling his days as a politician between 1990 and 1997, called &quot;Breaking the Code.&quot;

In September 2004, Brandreth&#x27;s book on the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, &quot;Philip and Elizabeth: Portrait of a Marriage&quot; was published. In July 2005, he published a second book on the royal family, entitled &quot;Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair&quot;, which concerns the three-decade love affair between the then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles.

In 2021, following the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Brandreth wrote, &quot;The duke showed me great friendliness over 40 years but royalty offer you friendliness, not friendship, and you have to remember the difference&quot;.

Brandreth has written a series of seven works of historical fiction called &quot;The Oscar Wilde Murder Mysteries&quot;, in which Oscar Wilde works with both Robert Sherard and Arthur Conan Doyle.

Brandreth has written and toured in a number of comedic one-man shows, including &quot;The One-to-One Show&quot; in 2010–2011, &quot;Looking for Happiness&quot; in 2013–2014 and &quot;Word Power&quot; in 2015–2016.

Brandreth has written a book entitled &quot;Have You Eaten Grandma?&quot;, about the English language and correct grammar.

==Politics==
Brandreth was a Conservative MP, representing the City of Chester, from 1992 to 1997. In 1992, he brought in a Plain Language Bill, to simplify language used in contracts, under the Ten Minute Rule. However it was objected to at Second Reading and was dropped. He proposed a private member&#x27;s bill which became law as the Marriage Act 1994, allowing civil marriages to be solemnized in certain &quot;approved premises&quot;. In 1995, he was appointed to a junior ministerial position as a Lord of the Treasury, with his role being essentially that of a whip.

He broadcast reminiscences of his parliamentary career on BBC radio as &quot;Brandreth on Office&quot; and &quot;The Brandreth Rules&quot; in 2001, 2003 and 2005.

In August 2014, Brandreth was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue. In May 2016, Brandreth told &quot;The Spectator&quot; that he was likely to vote for the UK to stay in the European Union in the following month&#x27;s referendum on the issue. In 2019, Brandreth confirmed that he had voted to remain, but accepted the result of the referendum and believed that the government had to &quot;get Brexit done&quot;.

== Gyles and George Knitwear ==
Brandreth is known for the colourful, humorous jumpers he has designed and worn throughout his career. He has stated on the BBC that &quot;it&#x27;s all I&#x27;m really known for&quot;. Collaborating with artist and knitwear designer George Hostler, Brandreth created hundreds of jumper designs that appear in books he and Hostler authored and produced under their knitwear label, Gyles &amp; George.

Brandreth has a room in his London home devoted to his jumpers, and claims to have one for almost every occasion. To name just a few examples: he has a knitted jumper emblazoned with a green frog that he has worn for appointments with princes (Philip and Charles); on other royal occasions, he has worn sweaters featuring corgis and crowns. He has appeared on television talking about rail strikes wearing a jumper that features a steam locomotive, and wore a sweater bearing the words &quot;The End&quot; on the day Boris Johnson resigned. And he has a Scrabble-themed jumper which he wears in his capacity as president of the Association of British Scrabble Players.

To strike a more serious note, he wore lounge suits rather than novelty jumpers when serving in Parliament, though he has stated: &quot;The first time I spoke in the House of Commons, I heard John Prescott on the bench opposite me muttering &#x27;woolly jumpers ha ha ha.&#x27; He could see I was thrown and he carried on. Eventually I had to pause and point out to Mr Prescott that the joy of a woolly jumper is that you can take it off at will. Whereas the blight of a woolly mind is that you&#x27;re lumbered with it for life&quot;.

In 2020, Brandreth partnered with American designer Jack Carlson to revive the label for the 21st century, with Gyles &amp; George joining Carlson&#x27;s collective of brands, Blazer Group. They have collaborated to re-release many of Brandreth&#x27;s original designs, including a jumper with the words &quot;I&#x27;m a Luxury&quot; across the front, famously worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, and another featuring the words &quot;What the **** is going on?&quot; (the back reads: &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me&quot;). They have also released a popular collection of sweaters themed around the Signs of the Zodiac.

Aside from Brandreth himself, the brand&#x27;s models and prominent customers have included Joanna Lumley, Floella Benjamin, Hugh Bonneville, Jane Asher, Elton John, Pete Davidson, Ziwe Fumudoh, Blanca Miro, Dwyane Wade, Keith Richards, and Diana, Princess of Wales.

In 2023, the Petersfield Museum opened an exhibition dedicated to Gyles &amp; George and Brandreth&#x27;s personal collection of jumpers.

==Other activities==

Brandreth is a former European &quot;Monopoly&quot; champion, and president of the Association of British Scrabble Players, having organised the first British National Scrabble Championship in 1971.

In 1987, Brandreth kissed Cheryl Baker onscreen for three minutes and 33 seconds, longer than the then-record longest onscreen kiss.

He is an after-dinner speaker and held the world record for the longest continuous after-dinner speech, twelve-and-a-half hours, done as a charity stunt. With his wife, he founded a Teddy bear museum. Located in Stratford-upon-Avon for 18 years, it was relocated to the Polka Theatre in Wimbledon, London. In 2016, the museum moved to Newby Hall in Yorkshire. He is a patron of the National Piers Society and vice-president of charity Fields in Trust (formerly the National Playing Fields Association).

In 2014, Brandreth was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (DLitt) from the University of Chester. In December 2016, he was named the university&#x27;s chancellor, and officially took the role in March 2017.

Since 2015, he has been the president of the Oscar Wilde Society, which was founded in 1990.

==Personal life==
Brandreth met his future wife, Michèle Brown, at Oxford. They were married at Marylebone Register Office on 8 June 1973, with actor Simon Cadell, Brandreth&#x27;s best friend from school, as a witness. The couple have lived in Barnes, southwest London, since 1986.

They have three children, including Aphra, who was elected as MP for Chester South and Eddisbury in 2024.

Brandreth is a vegetarian, and stopped drinking alcohol in 1997 to lose weight.

<text>Frances Clara Cleveland Preston (, christened Frank Clara; July 21, 1864 – October 29, 1947) was the first lady of the United States from 1886 to 1889 and again from 1893 until 1897, as the wife of President Grover Cleveland. She was the first, and until 2025, only person to serve in this role during two non-consecutive terms.

Folsom first met Grover Cleveland while she was an infant, as her father, Oscar Folsom, was a close friend to Cleveland. When her father died in 1875, Cleveland became the executor of the estate, and Cleveland paid off the family’s outstanding debts and provided for the well-being of Frances and her mother, Emma. After graduating Wells College she married Grover Cleveland while he was the incumbent president. When he lost reelection in 1888, the Clevelands went into private life for four years and began having children. After Grover Cleveland was elected president again in 1892, Frances dedicated much of her time in the second term to her children.

The Clevelands had five children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Cleveland became involved in education advocacy, serving on the Wells College board, supporting women&#x27;s education, and organizing the construction of kindergartens. Grover Cleveland died in 1908 and in 1913, Frances married Thomas J. Preston Jr.. She continued to work in education activism after leaving the White House, becoming involved with Princeton University. During World War I, she advocated military preparedness. She died in 1947 and was buried alongside her first husband in Princeton Cemetery.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Born in Buffalo, New York, on July 21, 1864, Frances Clara Folsom was the first child of Emma (née Harmon) and Oscar Folsom. Her only sibling, Nellie Augusta, died in infancy in 1872. Her father was a lawyer who had a law partnership with Grover Cleveland. Folsom and Cleveland first met when she was still an infant; he was a regular presence in her childhood, and he bought her her first baby carriage. Although the Folsoms were financially secure when she was born, her father&#x27;s gambling habits and his penchant for helping others with his money caused them financial trouble as she grew.

Folsom attended school at Madame Brecker&#x27;s French Kindergarten and Miss Bissell&#x27;s School for Young Ladies, both of which were among Buffalo&#x27;s best-regarded schools and guaranteed her an education above that of most women in her time. When not in school, she regularly spent time with Cleveland, known to her as &quot;Uncle Cleve&quot;. As a child, she went by the name Frank, and she was christened under this name as a teenager. The name sometimes caused her problems when she was assigned to boys&#x27; activities in school.

Folsom&#x27;s father died in a carriage accident on July 23, 1875. Cleveland was given charge of his estate and became Folsom&#x27;s unofficial guardian. Folsom and her mother moved to live with relatives, first with Folsom&#x27;s aunt in Saint Paul, Minnesota and then with her grandmother in Medina, New York. They eventually returned to Buffalo and lived in different boarding houses until they found a home.

=== Wells College ===
When Folsom was 14, she joined the Presbyterian Church, to which she remained devoted throughout her life. She attended Central High School in Buffalo, where she was briefly engaged to a seminary student, but the engagement was broken when they decided to remain friends. Folsom left Central High School in October 1881, before her schooling was finished.

Although Folsom had not finished school, Cleveland used his authority as the mayor of Buffalo to obtain for her a certificate of completion and entry into Wells College in Aurora, New York as a sophomore. Here she learned etiquette and manners from Helen Fairchild Smith, and she quickly became a prominent student at the school, taking her place at the center of its social life. At Wells, she became interested in photography and political science, and she participated in the Phoenix Society, a campus debate club. Folsom received two more marriage proposals at Wells, both on the same day. She accepted one of them, but this engagement was also ended by a decision to remain friends.

Cleveland, who became governor of New York at this time, maintained correspondence with Folsom while she attended Wells. He visited her, sent her flowers, and brought her on tours of New York when her schedule permitted. Folsom was unable to attend Cleveland&#x27;s presidential inauguration as it conflicted with her final exams, but she visited him at the White House during spring break some weeks later. Washington, D.C., left a positive impression on her, and she accompanied the new president on his nightly walks in the East Room while she stayed at the White House. Folsom was also permitted to ascend the Washington Monument before its opening, where she met former first lady Harriet Lane.

=== Engagement ===
Folsom graduated from Wells on June 20, 1885, and she spent the summer at her grandfather&#x27;s home in Wyoming County, New York. Cleveland proposed marriage by letter in August 1885, while Folsom was visiting a friend in Scranton, Pennsylvania. After accepting, Folsom accompanied her mother and her cousin on a year-long tour of Europe. Despite Folsom&#x27;s eagerness to wed, her mother and her future groom both insisted that she take the opportunity to travel and contemplate her future before marriage. Everyone involved agreed to keep the planned wedding a secret, and the president&#x27;s sister Rose Cleveland served as White House hostess in the meantime. Rumors of their engagement were initially dismissed as gossip, as speculation of the president&#x27;s love life was common. Popular gossip considered Frances&#x27; mother to be a more likely partner. Rumors grew after reporters caught up with the Folsoms and found them shopping for a wedding gown.

By the time of the Folsoms&#x27; return voyage, reporters were tracking their whereabouts, and they were forced to board their ship home in secret. They were greeted by the press upon returning to the United States, and rumors of Cleveland&#x27;s interest were seemingly confirmed when representatives of the president took the Folsoms away. It was only the next night that the White House officially announced that the president intended to marry Frances Folsom. Cleveland visited Folsom in New York while he was in the city attending a Decoration Day parade on May 30, 1886, and the Folsom women took a train to Washington, D.C., on June 1. Media attention quickly turned Folsom into a celebrity.

== First Lady of the United States ==
=== Wedding ===

The wedding of Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom took place in the Blue Room of the White House on June 2, 1886. The president wished for a quiet wedding, so only 31 guests were invited, and the press was explicitly denied entry. Hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside of the White House to celebrate. Frances Cleveland was the first presidential spouse to marry in the White House, and she was the youngest presidential spouse in American history. She was 21 years old, and her groom was 49. After their wedding, the Clevelands went on honeymoon for a week in Deer Park, Maryland, where they were closely followed by reporters who intruded on their privacy. After returning to the White House, they held two wedding receptions, one of which was open to the public.

=== First term ===

Frances Cleveland was immediately popular as first lady, attracting unprecedented publicity. She and Grover drew enough attention that the Clevelands chose not to use the living quarters of the White House. Instead, they moved to their private residence, the &quot;Red Top&quot;, to escape from the public and the media. Each evening, the couple drove to their private home to oversee improvements. Cleveland worked with socialite Flora Payne to better prepare for a role in high society. She also became close friends with poet Richard Watson Gilder and his wife Helena, and accompanied them in meeting prominent writers of the time. Cleveland stayed involved with Wells College as well, taking a seat on its board of trustees in 1887.

Cleveland maintained an openness with the public that was not shared by her husband or by her predecessor Rose Cleveland. To accommodate all who wished to visit the White House, she hosted many social events on Saturdays to ensure that they did not conflict with the schedules of working women. Cleveland received countless letters from the American people, many of them asking her to influence the president&#x27;s granting of patronage jobs. She read all of the mail that she received, but she sought assistance from the president&#x27;s secretaries in replying, eventually hiring her friend Minnie Alexander as a personal secretary. Her openness extended to the White House staff as well, with whom she maintained close relationships.

Cleveland was credited with an increase in the president&#x27;s sociability after their marriage. The president set aside time in his busy schedule to be with his wife, attending the theater and going on carriage rides. While Cleveland had considerable influence in their home life, she had little involvement in the political aspects of her husband&#x27;s administration. Her popularity nonetheless served her husband&#x27;s administration well. Many of the president&#x27;s political opponents acknowledged the difficulty of attacking the administration when the first lady had such support, and critics were careful not to attack her directly lest they provoke backlash. She was once even sent as the president&#x27;s representative during the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 to quietly observe from the visitors&#x27; gallery.

In 1887, the Clevelands toured the United States. Frances endured a severe insect bite and a black eye, and she spent so much time shaking hands that she needed to use an ice pack each night. Crowds of people became a constant on their trip, often preventing their carriage from moving. Their visit to Chicago was attended by about 100,000 people, with the crowd becoming so large that Cleveland had to be taken away by aides for her own safety while police and soldiers attempted to control the crowd. Cleveland avoided such publicized appearances for the rest of her time as first lady.

Toward the end of the president&#x27;s first term, opponents began crafting rumors to diminish her reputation. One rumor suggested that Grover was abusive toward Frances. In response, Frances praised her husband and harshly condemned the rumor as a political smear. For the first lady to speak so openly about such a topic was unprecedented. Another rumor suggested that she was unfaithful to her husband, having an affair with newspaper editor Henry Watterson. She remained a prominent figure when her husband sought reelection in the 1888 presidential election. The 1888 Democratic National Convention was the first such convention in which a first lady was recognized during a speech.

=== Private life ===

Cleveland&#x27;s tenure as first lady ended after her husband lost his reelection campaign, but she correctly predicted to the staff that they would return the following term. The Clevelands left the White House, sold the Red Top house, and moved to Madison Avenue in New York. Cleveland struggled with the transition from public to private life, having never run a private household of her own. She underwent a period of depression over the following months, and she retreated to the Gilders&#x27; cottage in Marion, Massachusetts. The Clevelands found a cottage to rent in the area, and they eventually purchased the Gray Gables summer home in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, where the couple developed their own private home life. Here they often hosted close friends, including the Gilders and actor Joseph Jefferson. Cleveland found comfort in this house, where she and her husband could lead a relatively normal life.

Despite no longer being the first lady, Cleveland remained in the public spotlight. In between her tenures as first lady, Cleveland took on charity work and grew more involved in New York social life through her charitable projects. Although they occasionally worked together on these projects, Frances and Grover for the most part led separate social lives after leaving the White House. Among her charitable endeavors was the promotion of kindergartens in New York, serving as the vice president of Gilder&#x27;s New York Kindergarten Association. Frances received further attention when she became a mother with the birth of Ruth Cleveland in 1891. She dedicated herself to Ruth, taking on many of the roles that a woman of her status would have typically given to a nurse, such as bathing the child.

Grover ran for president again in the 1892 presidential election. Although he never approved of it, Frances&#x27; image was often used prominently in campaign material. Her social connections and press coverage were valuable for the Cleveland campaign in New York. Her charity work in the state and her friendship with the Gilders enabled the Clevelands to build connections with New York&#x27;s Four Hundred society and helped win over disaffected Republicans. These factors contributed to Grover winning in his home state, which he had failed to do in 1888. Nonetheless, he disapproved of any involvement his wife had in the political aspects of his career. After Grover was reelected president, the Clevelands left their home on Madison Avenue, spending the period before the inauguration living on 51st Street next door to their friend Elias Cornelius Benedict and then in Lakewood, New Jersey.

=== Second term ===

The Clevelands returned to the White House on March 4, 1893. Just as her husband was the first of only two men to ever hold the presidency for two non-consecutive terms, Frances became the only first lady to serve non-consecutively. She was more apprehensive about taking the role for a second time, now being aware of all that it entailed. Her routine largely resembled that of her first tenure, including her evening drives with the president and her Saturday receptions. She received the familiar crowds that she had encountered during her previous time as first lady as well as heads of state, including one instance in which she disregarded precedent by meeting with Infanta Eulalia of Spain at her hotel. She also continued her work in the establishment of kindergartens and became involved with the Home for Friendless Colored Girls, visiting the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church with the group in 1896.

Cleveland became increasingly protective of her husband during his second term—a reversal of their relationship in his first term. The president&#x27;s work grew more difficult as the Panic of 1893 set in, and Cleveland found herself tending to her husband. The president&#x27;s health was in decline during his second term, and his wife became increasingly responsible for his well-being, encouraging him to exert himself less. When it became apparent that the president had cancer, she took responsibility for keeping his condition a secret and tending to his health, despite her pregnancy with her second child, which at this time was in its seventh month. She provided excuses for his absences and wrote letters on his behalf, insisting that he was merely suffering from rheumatism.

Cleveland had two more daughters as first lady: Esther Cleveland in 1893 and Marion Cleveland in 1895. She gave birth to Esther in the White House, making her the only first lady to give birth in the presidential residence. Much of her time was dedicated to raising her three children, and she would even play on the floor with her children, to the shock of the servants who had never before seen a first lady act in such a manner. Cleveland also took an interest in German culture during her husband&#x27;s second term, learning to speak the language and hiring a German nurse so her children would learn it as well. Cleveland&#x27;s time was split between her responsibilities as first lady and those as a mother. Her second term was not as socially active as her first, and she hosted only one reception in the 1894 social season.

The Clevelands were upset at the extent of press and public attention focused on their children, and they controversially had the White House closed to the public while they were present. They purchased another private residence, Woodley, where they could live away from the White House. Harassment from the public continued at their new residence, and Cleveland was particularly frightened by an incident in 1894 when three men were stalking their home. Fearing for her children&#x27;s safety, she had the local police station post a guard at their home, choosing not to worry her husband with the news.

Three thousand people attended the first lady&#x27;s final Saturday reception to shake her hand. Cleveland wept as she left the White House, personally saying goodbye to each member of the staff. This organized farewell would be replicated by future first ladies, becoming a tradition. Despite her emotional departure, she later expressed relief that she was no longer first lady, remembering the rumors and falsehoods that had surrounded her.

==Widowhood and remarriage==

After leaving the White House for the second time, the Clevelands bought Westland, a house in Princeton, New Jersey. They had two more children over the following years: Richard F. Cleveland and Francis Cleveland. Their firstborn daughter, Ruth, died of diphtheria in 1904 at their Gray Gables vacation home. Wishing to avoid memories of Ruth&#x27;s illness and death, the Clevelands sold the home and purchased Intermont, a summer home in Tamworth, New Hampshire. They involved themselves with Princeton University and provided financial support for many Princeton students. Grover died in 1908, and Frances was left to raise their four remaining children alone. She refused the pension to which she was legally entitled as a widowed first lady, but she did accept the franking privilege that was offered to presidential widows in 1909.

In March 1909, Cleveland held a memorial service for her husband at Carnegie Hall. After her husband&#x27;s death, Cleveland became involved in a legal battle against writer Broughton Brandenburg, who had been paid by &quot;The New York Times&quot; for an article supposedly written by Grover Cleveland before his death, but which was found to be a forgery created by Brandenburg. She was unable to prevent its publication after she discovered that it was fraudulent. She testified against Brandenburg in court, and he was found guilty of grand larceny. The ordeal made national headlines. Still grieving for her husband, Cleveland spent time away on a vacation to Europe with her family from September 1909 to May 1910.

On October 29, 1912, Wells College announced that Cleveland intended to remarry. She was engaged to Thomas J. Preston Jr., professor of archaeology and acting president at Wells College, where she served as a trustee. She was invited to return to the White House for a dinner to celebrate her engagement in January 1913, much to the excitement of the staff who had known her previously. As with her previous engagement, she was secretive about the process to limit media attention. Both Wells College and Princeton University congratulated them with the expectation that the couple would be active at their respective campuses. Frances Cleveland and Thomas Preston were wed on February 10, 1913. She was the first presidential widow to remarry. After their marriage, the Prestons went on honeymoon in Florida. Her second husband went on to teach at Princeton University, where she continued to be a prominent figure in campus social life.

== Later life ==
The Prestons moved to London in April 1914. Frances Cleveland-Preston was vacationing with her children and her mother in St. Moritz, Switzerland, when World War I began in August 1914. They returned to the United States via Genoa, arriving on October 1. Cleveland-Preston and her husband worked with activists Solomon Stanwood Menken and Robert McNutt McElroy throughout the war to promote military preparedness. She was appointed head of the speakers&#x27; bureau of the National Security League (NSL), where she was responsible for organizing rallies and other events to support the war effort. She caused controversy by accusing some Americans of being unassimilated, and she resigned from her position on December 8, 1919, after backlash to what some in the NSL saw as overzealous views around patriotic education.

Cleveland-Preston became more outspoken in her political beliefs as she grew older, taking a prominent position as an opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage and serving as the vice president of the New Jersey Association Opposed to Woman&#x27;s Suffrage from 1913 to 1920. In the 1928 presidential election, she gave her only formal political endorsement to someone other than her first husband, endorsing Al Smith for president. She had met the Smiths and grew upset with the anti-Catholic attacks against them. She was especially sympathetic to his wife Catherine, and Cleveland-Preston made a point of sitting with her at events as a show of support.

Cleveland-Preston supported Franklin D. Roosevelt as president in 1932, and she admired his wife Eleanor Roosevelt, but she declined to vote for Roosevelt in 1940 due to her first husband&#x27;s opposition to a third term. She subsequently supported Harry S. Truman. During the Truman presidency, she was invited to a luncheon at the White House where she met General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower is quoted as not recognizing her and asking where in the city she used to live, prompting her to respond that she had lived in the White House.

Later in life, Cleveland-Preston was afflicted by cataracts, and she learned Braille to use a Braille typewriter. She continued to use it after her cataracts were removed, translating books into Braille for blind children. She was involved with the theater community in her old age, sometimes traveling with the theater troupe founded by her son. Cleveland-Preston attended the Princeton University bicentennial celebration in June 1946, which proved to be her final public appearance. While staying at her son Richard&#x27;s home for his 50th birthday in Baltimore, she died in her sleep at the age of 83 on October 29, 1947. She holds the record as the First Lady with the longest post-presidency. She was buried in Princeton Cemetery next to President Cleveland.

== Legacy ==

Cleveland was much-loved as first lady, drawing an unprecedented level of media and public attention. Her travels and activities were meticulously documented by reporters, to the president&#x27;s ire. The furor at times even became dangerous, with large crowds pushing to see her, threatening to topple into her and one another. Her presence in the White House mitigated her husband&#x27;s surly reputation and fostered an image of the president as a loving husband, and later as a loving father.

Cleveland&#x27;s reputation influenced the role of first lady for generations after her tenure. The form letters used by Cleveland as first lady remained in use, eventually being redrafted by Eleanor Roosevelt. In honor of Frances Cleveland, Cleveland Hall was constructed in 1911 on the Wells College campus. Contemporaries ranked her among the greatest of first ladies. In 1982, the Siena College Research Institute polled historians on the performances of first ladies; Cleveland was placed 13th out of 42, but the 2008 edition of the poll placed her 20th of 38.

=== Fashion and image ===
Much of Cleveland&#x27;s fame and media coverage focused on her appearance and her fashion, and her fashion choices were widely imitated by women throughout the United States. These included her hairstyle, a low knot over a shaved nape, which became known as the &quot;á la Cleveland&quot;. Her fashion choices and purchases influenced the behavior of consumers, and products she reportedly used enjoyed an increase in popularity. An article published by the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; falsely stated that she no longer purchased bustles, causing a decline in their popularity. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union wrote to her requesting that she dress more modestly, fearing that she was setting a poor example. She declined to do so.

Cleveland&#x27;s immense popularity led to the extensive use of her image in advertising, and many products falsely claimed to have her endorsement. It became such a problem that a bill was introduced to Congress that would establish personality rights for women and criminalize the unauthorized use of a person&#x27;s image, but the bill did not pass. Cleveland updated her fashion choices during her husband&#x27;s second term. Reflecting the trends of the Gay Nineties, she wore tight gowns, feather boas, and picture hats. News articles on her activities continued to reference her sense of fashion in her old age.

=== Politics ===

Although she was personally interested in politics, Cleveland did not publicly support political causes while serving as first lady. One exception to her avoidance of politics was her interest in the political situation of the Republic of Hawaii, where she endorsed the restoration of monarchy with Princess Ka&#x27;iulani&#x27;s claim to the throne as the heir apparent. She also supported the temperance movement, personally abstaining from alcohol and donating to the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, but she was unwilling to impose these beliefs on others and continued to serve wine at White House receptions.

She worked with charity groups, including the Needlework Guild, which made clothes for the poor, and the Christmas Club and the Colored Christmas Club, which gave gifts to children during the holiday season. Cleveland&#x27;s activism focused heavily on the arts, and she was a supporter of international copyright protections, attending a convention on the subject while first lady in 1888. She also provided charitable support, sponsoring many aspiring musicians.

Cleveland supported women&#x27;s education and believed it to be an important step in gender equality. She did not support women&#x27;s suffrage, and she avoided commenting on the controversial issue during her tenure as first lady. Like many female anti-suffragists of her generation, she felt that politics was an unfortunate duty to be avoided and that it risked women&#x27;s control of the domestic sphere. Despite this, she chose to vote in elections after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.

<doc id="415644" wikidata="Q794480" url="?curid=415644" title="Bridge Mountain (Nevada)">
<text>Bridge Mountain is a mountain located in the Spring Mountain range of southern Nevada. It is located on land managed by the United States Bureau of Land Management as the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, part of the Rainbow Mountain Wilderness. Bridge Mountain is named for the natural feature of a bridge-like natural arch of sandstone near the summit.

== Hiking Route ==
The Bridge Mountain hike begins at the Rocky Gap Summit Trailhead, accessible by 4WD drive only. Hikers can park at the north Willow Springs campground and walk to the summit. Alternatively, hikers can turn North from Highway 160 and drive North on the Lovell Canyon Road and park where the pavement ends. The hike from here to the summit is about and has less elevation gain.

The hike climbs over the crest of the shale formed, north-south oriented Spring Mountain Ranges, and rewards the hiker with panoramic views of the Red Rock Escarpment below. A marked trail along the crest descends to the sandstone escarpment. Here, steep free climbing down a chimney—possible without technical gear—takes the hiker to a narrow neck of rock that separates the drainages of Pine Creek to the south and Icebox Canyon to the north. The hike is marked by cairns that show the route to proceed up toward the base of a cliff, angling left just above the northern drop-off. The hike ascends the slickrock here, in a crack in the rock. After about , the route comes to a point where there is a broad, flat ledge on the left, then continues about several feet to the left where a wider gully climbs to the top of the cliff. This leads up to the natural bridge for which the mountain is named. The bridge itself is the remains of a tinaja, or water tank, that eroded and left a remnant of the side, now a bridge.

In order to get to the top, one must climb over a fallen tree, bringing the person within reach of several pools, access to the bridge, and near the Hidden Forest (see below). Heading south for several hundred feet, one then must climb along a steep, difficult ridge to get near the top. At the top, a small ammunition box contains the peak&#x27;s sign-in book.

In a cleft in the sandstone of Bridge Mountain&#x27;s summit, there is a small hidden forest of Ponderosa pine. Expansive views of the Las Vegas Valley can be seen from the Eastern end of the hidden forest.

<doc id="415646" wikidata="Q336537" url="?curid=415646" title="Glenys Kinnock">
<text>Glenys Elizabeth Kinnock, Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead, (; 7 July 1944 – 3 December 2023), was a British politician and teacher who served as Minister of State for Europe from June to October 2009 and Minister of State for Africa and the United Nations from 2009 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, she was previously a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Wales, formerly South Wales East, from 1994 to 2009.

==Early life==
Glenys Elizabeth Parry was born in Roade, Northamptonshire, and educated at Holyhead Comprehensive School, Anglesey. She graduated in 1965 from University College, Cardiff in education and history. Parry worked at Moorland Primary School, in Splott, in 1966. She met Neil Kinnock at university and married him in 1967.

==European Parliament==
Kinnock represented Wales in the European Parliament from 1994 until 2009, where she was a member of the Party of European Socialists (PES) political group. She was a Member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Development and Co-operation Committee and a substitute member of the Committee on Citizens&#x27; Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. She was a co-president of the African, Caribbean and Pacific-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly from 2002 to 2009, and Labour spokesperson on International Development in the European Parliament. In November 2006 Kinnock was criticised for &quot;taking a &quot; to Barbados to discuss world poverty issues. Kinnock co-presided over the 12th ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.

==Domestic political career==
In the 2009 cabinet reshuffle, Kinnock was appointed minister for Europe following the resignation of Caroline Flint. To enable her to join the government, she was awarded a life peerage and became Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead, &quot;of Holyhead in the County of Ynys Môn&quot; on 30 June 2009. She was introduced to the House of Lords on the same day. 

In 2009, while she was minister for Europe, the status of the Welsh language was elevated to make it equal with several other European minority languages, such as Catalan. The cost of translation services was to be met by the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh Language Board. Kinnock commented &quot;This demonstrates a clear commitment by the EU to promote its unique and diverse cultural heritage&quot;.

From 2009 to 2010, Kinnock served as minister of state for Africa and the United Nations, filling a post left vacant after the resignation of Lord Malloch-Brown. From 2010 to 2013 she was an Opposition spokesperson for the Department of International Development in the House of Lords. Kinnock retired from the Lords on 9 April 2021.

==Personal life==
She was the wife of Neil Kinnock, who was leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992, and they had two children together, including Stephen. When her husband was given a life peerage in 2005, she was entitled to the title &quot;Lady Kinnock&quot;, but decided against its use. However, she became Lady (or Baroness) Kinnock in her own right when she was ennobled in 2009. Kinnock grew up speaking Welsh.

In 2017, Kinnock was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Her husband spoke about their experience with the disease and providing support for her. She died from complications of the disease at her home in London, on 3 December 2023, aged 79.

<doc id="415648" wikidata="Q272522" url="?curid=415648" title="Jill Evans">
<text>Jill Evans (born 8 May 1959) is a Plaid Cymru politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Wales from 1999 to 2020. She was the first person to use the Welsh language in debate at the European Parliament.

In June 1999, Evans was elected as one of the first Plaid Cymru MEPs, and was re-elected every five years until the last occasion in 2019. From 2009 until 2014, she was the Vice-President of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, and is a member of the Committee on Culture and Education.

She also deputised on the Transport and Tourism Committee and was a member of the Delegation for relations with Switzerland and Norway and to the EU-Iceland Joint Parliamentary Committee and the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.

==Background==
Evans was born in Ystrad, Rhondda. She was educated at Tonypandy Grammar School before attending the Polytechnic of Wales, Trefforest (now the University of South Wales) where she earned an M.Phil.

==Professional career==
Evans worked as a research assistant at the former Polytechnic of Wales. She later worked as public affairs officer for the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes in Wales for six years. Following her first election to public office, she took up the post of Wales Organiser for CHILD - the infertility support network.

==Political career==
Evans was a political activist before being elected to public office, and participated in the Greenham Common campaign. She first stood in Torfaen in the general election of 1987. She was later elected to Rhondda Borough Council in 1992, Mid Glamorgan County Council in 1993, and, following the abolition of these, to the Rhondda Cynon Taf Council in 1995, from which she stood down in 1999.

During her time as a councillor, she was elected as Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Alternate Member of the Committee of the Regions in 1993 and served for four years, and was also the party&#x27;s representative on the European Free Alliance, working with Plaid Cymru&#x27;s sister parties throughout the continent. In 2004 she became the first member of the European Parliament to use the Welsh language in debate, following a change in the rules, permitting the use of a non-official EU language, though without the benefit of translation. After making most of her speech in English, she reiterated the key points in Welsh, saying that it was a step forward towards a Europe of the peoples and a Europe that celebrates its diversity.

Evans was Chair of Plaid Cymru between 1994 and 1996. In June 1999 she was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for Wales, becoming one of the Party&#x27;s first MEPs. She was re-elected in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019.

During the 2009 – 2014 Parliament, Evans was a member of the Green / European Free Alliance (EFA) Group - the fourth largest group in the Parliament.

<doc id="415650" wikidata="Q1607189" url="?curid=415650" title="Henry Pottinger">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pottinger, 1st Baronet (3 October 1789 – 18 March 1856) was an Bombay Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the first governor of Hong Kong from 1843 to 1844.

== Early life ==
Henry Pottinger was born at his family estate of Mount Pottinger in Ballymacarrett in the north of County Down in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, on 3 October 1789. At the time of his birth, all of Ireland was part of the British-ruled Kingdom of Ireland. An Ulster Protestant, he was descended from the Pottingers of Berkshire, an English family by origin with a branch that had settled in Ulster during the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century. He was the fifth son of Eldred Curwen Pottinger and his wife Anne. They had three daughters and eight sons. His nephew was also named Eldred Pottinger. Henry attended the Belfast Academy until the age of 12. In 1803, he left for India to join the East India Company&#x27;s maritime service, but in the following year joined the Company&#x27;s military service as a cadet instead. He studied local languages in Bombay and became an assistant teacher. On 18 September 1806, he was made an ensign and promoted to lieutenant on 16 July 1809.

== India ==

Pottinger explored the lands between the Indus and Persia, traveling in disguise as a Muslim merchant and studying local languages, under the orders of Sir John Malcolm. In 1809, he served as a lieutenant in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. In 1810, he and Charles Christie undertook an expedition from Nushki (Balochistan) to Isfahan (Central Persia) disguised as Muslims. Christie went north to Herat and then west while Pottinger went west across two deserts to Kerman and Isfahan where they rejoined. The expedition was funded by the East India Company to map and research the regions of Balochistan and Persia because of concerns about India being invaded by French forces. It would be 100 years before another European took this route, and Pottinger rose to the rank of Colonel. Pottinger later became Resident Administrator of Sindh in 1820. He later held the same post in Hyderabad.

He was made a baronet when he returned to England in 1839.

== China ==

Pottinger accepted Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston&#x27;s offer of the post of envoy and plenipotentiary in China and superintendent of British trade, thus replacing Charles Elliot. In 1841, Palmerston instructed him to &quot;examine with care the natural capacities of Hong Kong, and you will not agree to give up that Island unless you should find that you can exchange it for another in the neighbourhood of Canton, better adapted for the purposes in view; equally defensible; and affording sufficient shelter for Ships of War and Commerce&quot;.

Pottinger left London on 5 June, travelled by ship through the Mediterranean, over land across the Suez, and reached Bombay on 7 July, where he stayed for 10 days before arriving in China on 10 August. The whole trip took 67 days, a record at the time. On 4 November, Palmerston&#x27;s successor Lord Aberdeen wrote to Pottinger that he had doubts over Hong Kong&#x27;s acquisition since it would incur administrative expenses, and complicate relations with China and other nations.

After Pottinger joined the British expeditionary force in northern China, he negotiated the terms of the Treaty of Nanking (1842), which ended the First Opium War and ceded Hong Kong Island to the United Kingdom. Pottinger wrote in a letter to Aberdeen that at a feast celebrating the ratification with his Hong Kong counterpart, Keying, Keying insisted they ceremonially exchange miniature portraits of each member of each others&#x27; families. Upon receiving a miniature portrait of Pottinger&#x27;s wife, Pottinger wrote that Keying &quot;placed it on his head—which I am told is the highest token of respect and friendship—filled a glass of wine, held the picture in front of his face, muttered some words in a low voice, drank the wine, again placed the picture on his head and then sat down&quot; to complete the ceremony of long-term amity between the two families and the two peoples.

== Governor of Hong Kong ==

Pottinger became the second Administrator of Hong Kong (1841–1843) and the first Governor of Hong Kong (1843–1844). When he forwarded the treaty to Aberdeen, Pottinger remarked, &quot;the retention of Hong Kong is the only point in which I have intentionally exceeded my modified instructions, but every single hour I have passed in this superb country has convinced me of the necessity and desirability of our possessing such a settlement as an emporium for our trade and a place from which Her Majesty&#x27;s subjects in China may be alike protected and controlled.&quot;

On 26 April 1843, Pottinger&#x27;s residence, now the Former French Mission Building, was burgled. In May 1843, he recommended a police force of four officers and 50 men be recruited from Britain, but this was rejected on financial grounds.

On 26 June 1843, he was appointed to become the Chief Commander of the British troops stationed in Hong Kong.

During his short tenure, Pottinger established executive and legislative chambers, with one discussing political affairs and one designing legal codes. However, the chambers did not convene often, and this gave Pottinger wide-ranging powers to decide on policy.

Towards the end of his tenure, Pottinger lost the support of the local British merchants and was isolated. He left on 7 May 1844.

During his governorship, Hong Kong became the major port for trading opium in China.

== Later life ==
Pottinger returned to Britain in 1844. He became a member of the Privy Council on 23 May 1844, was presented with the freedom of many cities, and in June 1845 the House of Commons voted to grant him £1,500 a year for life. In 1847, he served as Governor of the Cape Colony. He returned to India as Governor of Madras from 1848 to 1854, and was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1851. He died in retirement in Malta on 18 March 1856. He was buried in the Protestant cemetery, now known as the Msida Bastion Historic Garden, in Floriana. A marble plaque is still visible.

== Family ==
In 1820, Pottinger married Susanna Maria Cooke (1800–1886), daughter of Captain Richard Cooke. They had three sons and a daughter:
*Eldred Elphinstone Pottinger (born 1822); died in infancy.
*Frederick Pottinger, 2nd Baronet (1831–1865); police inspector.
*Henry Pottinger, 3rd Baronet (1834–1909); barrister; married in 1863; one daughter who married Henry Meysey-Thompson, 1st Baron Knaresborough.

<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected in the 1992 general election, held on 9 April.

During the 1992–97 Parliament, Betty Boothroyd was the Speaker, John Major served as Prime Minister, and Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Margaret Beckett, and Tony Blair served as Leader of the Opposition. This Parliament was dissolved on 8 April 1997.

== By nation ==

* List of MPs for constituencies in Scotland (1992–1997)
* List of MPs for constituencies in Wales (1992–1997)

== Composition ==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties as it was directly after the 1992 general election and before the 1997 general election:

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.



== By-elections ==
See the list of United Kingdom by-elections.

Two seats were vacant when Parliament was dissolved preparatory to the 1997 general election:
*Meriden: Iain Mills (Con) died 13 January 1997
*Don Valley: Martin Redmond (Lab) died 16 January 1997

One further MP died prior to the 1997 general election (who was standing down due to health problems, incidentally) during the period in which parliament was dissolved:
*North Dorset: Nicholas Baker (Con) died 25 April 1997

== Defections ==
*1995 Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon) defects from Con to Lab.
*1995 Emma Nicholson (Devon West and Torridge) defects from Con to Lib Dem.
*1996 Peter Thurnham (Bolton North East) defects from Con to Lib Dem, with eight months as an independent.
*March 1997 George Gardiner (Reigate) defects from Con to Referendum Party.

== Progression of government majority and party totals ==
The government voting total is the total number of Conservative MPs, minus the two Conservative Deputy Speakers. The opposition voting total is the total number of other MPs, minus the Speaker and the Labour Deputy Speaker. The majority is the difference between the former and the latter. See also here.

<doc id="415653" wikidata="Q6204390" url="?curid=415653" title="Jo Richardson">
<text>Josephine Richardson (28 August 1923 – 1 February 1994) was a British Labour Party politician. At the time of her death she was Member of Parliament for Barking, a post she had held almost exactly 20 years, since 1974.

==Early life==
She was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, and attended Southend High School for Girls. Her father, a sales representative, had stood as a Liberal Party candidate in Darlington during the 1930s; he died while she was still young. Her mother was a member of the Congregational Church.

Despite her intellect, Richardson was unable to afford a university education, which she regretted throughout her life.

==Parliamentary career==
Having joined the Labour Party in 1945, she began her political career as Ian Mikardo&#x27;s secretary. Richardson co-ordinated the Keep Left Group within the party, and went on to become the secretary of the Tribune Group before co-ordinating the Victory for Socialism Campaign. In 1951 she was elected to Hornsey Borough Council and became Mikardo&#x27;s full-time secretary and working partner in his business, which involved trade with eastern Europe. After unsuccessful campaigns as the Labour candidate in Monmouth in 1951 and 1955, Hornchurch in 1959, and Harrow East in 1964, Richardson was elected Member of Parliament for Barking in February 1974. 

Richardson was seen as a peace campaigner on the hard left of the Labour Party. She was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, but resigned in 1988 in protest at Tony Benn&#x27;s decision to challenge Neil Kinnock for the leadership. Richardson also served as a member of the Shadow Cabinet. She was a central figure of the feminist left, helped to expand women&#x27;s rights in Britain, and was the head of a group of women MPs that supported the anti-pornography position. She was also a pro-choice campaigner.

Richardson also served as an executive member of the National Council for Civil Liberties during a time in which the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), a pro-paedophile activist group, was affiliated with it. She wrote to PIE journal &quot;Childhood Rights&quot;, saying that she supported that organisation&#x27;s campaign against corporal punishment.

She co-authored the pamphlet &quot;Keeping Left&quot; (1950) with Richard Crossman, Michael Foot and Ian Mikardo.

In 1985, KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky named Richardson and two other left-wing Labour MPs as confidential contacts of his embassy.

==Death and legacy==
Amid complications of rheumatoid arthritis, Richardson&#x27;s health declined precipitously in her last year of life, and she underwent spinal surgery. During this time, she was sometimes transported to the House of Commons by ambulance. She died from respiratory failure at her home on 1 February 1994, at the age of 70.

Jo Richardson Community School, in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, was named in her honour.

<doc id="415655" wikidata="Q300269" url="?curid=415655" title="Pat Doherty (Northern Ireland politician)">
<text>Patrick Doherty (born 18 July 1945) is a retired Sinn Féin politician, who served as the abstentionist Member of Parliament (MP) for West Tyrone from 2001 to 2017. He was also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for West Tyrone from 1998 to June 2012. Doherty served as Vice President of Sinn Féin from 1988 to 2009, when Mary Lou McDonald became the party&#x27;s new Vice President.

==Political career==
Doherty was born in Glasgow; his parents were from County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. He moved to Donegal in 1968, shortly before the Troubles broke out across the Irish border. He was an abstentionist Sinn Féin Member of Parliament of the British parliament for West Tyrone from 2001 to 2017, as well as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from the 1998 elections until 2012. He has also stood for election in the Republic of Ireland, in the constituency of Donegal North-East in 1989, 1996 (a by-election) and 1997, and also in the Connacht–Ulster constituency in the EU elections in 1989 and 1994.

In May 2002, using parliamentary privilege, Ulster Unionist Party MP David Burnside named Doherty as a member of the IRA Army Council.

==Personal life==
According to &quot;The Times Guide to the House of Commons&quot;, Pat Doherty is married with three daughters and two sons, was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s College, Lochwinnoch, and is a site engineer who likes building stone walls. He is the brother of former Provisional IRA member Hugh Doherty, known for his involvement in the Balcombe Street siege.

Over a two-and-a-half-year period Doherty spent £16,000 on printer cartridges, an amount that he admitted was &quot;probably excessive&quot;.

In 2012, to some surprise, Doherty supported funding for a loyalist flute band in Castlederg. He praised the band in the application for reaching out to &quot;all sections of the community&quot;. The band had sought support for its funding application from a community group who then, unbeknownst to the band, reached out to Doherty. A spokesman for the band, whose website features a song commemorating deceased Ulster Volunteer Force member Brian Robinson, distanced themselves from the application, claiming the band was unaware of Doherty&#x27;s support and did not want it. He added that &quot;The band harbours nothing but contempt for Irish republicanism and its attacks on their community&quot;. Four of the band&#x27;s members were killed by the IRA.

<doc id="415667" wikidata="Q1189028" url="?curid=415667" title="Dennis Canavan">
<text>Dennis Andrew Canavan (born 8 August 1942) is a Scottish politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Falkirk West from 1974 to 2000 (known as West Stirlingshire from 1974 to 1983), first as a member of the Labour Party, and then as an Independent. He then served as an Independent Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Falkirk West from 1999 to 2007.

In 2014, he was the chair of the Advisory Board of Yes Scotland, the campaign for independence in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

==Early life==
Born in Cowdenbeath, Canavan was educated at St. Bride&#x27;s and St. Columba&#x27;s Schools, Cowdenbeath, St Andrew&#x27;s College, Drygrange, and at the University of Edinburgh. He worked as a schoolteacher from 1968 until 1974 and was Assistant Head of Holy Rood High School Edinburgh at the time of his first election to Parliament. Canavan was also head of the maths department at St Modans High in Stirling.

==Career==

===British Parliament (1974-1999)===
He was leader of the Labour Party Group on Stirling District Council in 1974 and, in October of that year, was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for West Stirlingshire. Following boundary changes, he was MP for Falkirk West from 1983 to 2000. He was Chair of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group from 1980 to 1981. In 1975, he tried introducing a bill to abolish corporal punishment in schools and his efforts formed part of the case presented to the European Commission of Human Rights which led eventually to abolition. He voted against the Blair Government&#x27;s proposals to cut benefits for children of lone parents, abolish student grants and introduce tuition fees.

A keen sports enthusiast, he was founder and Convener of the Scottish Sports Group at Westminster and the Cross-Party Sports Group in the Scottish Parliament. He has completed a marathon in less than three hours and the Ben Nevis Race in just over two hours. He won a gold medal, playing for Scotland in the British Universities Football Championships in 1967. In his book &quot;The Final Whistle?&quot;, Harry Reid claims that Canavan took part in the 1977 Wembley pitch invasion after Scotland beat England and ripped up a patch of the turf.

He takes an active interest in international affairs and served as a member of the House of Commons select committees on Foreign Affairs and International Development. He is still a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Amnesty International and is interested in conflict resolution.

He chaired the Northern Ireland Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 1989 to 1997, and led several parliamentary delegations to Ireland during The Troubles. He served on the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body from 1992 to 2000. As a member of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament, he was author of a report on the potential for co-operation between Scotland and Ireland. He has frequently spoken out against sectarianism and racism.

===Scottish Parliament (1999-2007)===
Throughout his political life, Canavan played a leading part in the campaign for a Scottish Parliament. When Labour was in opposition under James Callaghan, Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, John Smith and Tony Blair, he led a nationwide consultation about devolution, on behalf of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs, leading to the publication of a bill to establish a Scottish Parliament with revenue-raising powers. However, in 1999, when the first elections to the Scottish Parliament were held, the New Labour leadership rejected him as an official Labour candidate, despite the fact that he had the support of 97% of local party members. He therefore stood as an Independent, and was consequently expelled from the party. Although there were rumours he would join the Scottish National Party, he did not join another party. He won with almost 55 percent of the vote, the highest majority of any MSP in the 1999 election. He resigned his Westminster seat in 2000 to concentrate on representing his constituents in the Scottish Parliament. Canavan retained his Holyrood seat in 2003 with 55.7 percent of the vote, again with the biggest majority in Scotland.

In the Scottish Parliament, he was a member of the European and External Relations Committee and Convener of the All-Party Sports Group from 1999.
In 2003 he criticised the Scottish football authorities when Falkirk Football Club was refused promotion to the Scottish Premier League, despite having won the First Division Championship. He supported Falkirk&#x27;s efforts to build a new stadium for community use and he still regularly attends the club&#x27;s matches. He is also Honorary President of Milton Amateurs Football Club.

Canavan enjoys hill-walking and, in the Scottish Parliament, he championed the people&#x27;s right of access to the countryside, successfully introducing amendments to the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to extend the right of access to country estates, including land belonging to the Queen. He is now President of Ramblers Scotland.

He is a strong supporter of the idea of a national holiday to celebrate St Andrew&#x27;s Day, and his bill to achieve this was eventually passed as the St. Andrew&#x27;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007.

==Retirement from politics==
When he announced his retirement before the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, he was the longest serving parliamentarian in the Scottish Parliament, having completed a combined 33 years at Westminster and Holyrood. After this announcement he received an ovation in the Chamber of the Scottish Parliament from other MSPs and was praised by the First Minister Jack McConnell as &quot;an outstanding parliamentarian over a long, long period of time&quot;.

In April 2010, Canavan declared his support for John McNally, the Scottish National Party candidate for Falkirk in the 2010 general election. Falkirk is the successor to Canavan&#x27;s former Westminster constituency.

==After politics==
Canavan has been a member of the board of trustees of the National Mining Museum Scotland. He has been a patron of Bonnybridge Driving Force, a charity involved with the organisation of volunteer drivers transporting patients to and from hospital.

In 2018, the Scottish Government commissioned an independent review into the impact of policing on communities during the miners strike and Canvan was appointed a member of the advisory panel.

==Honours and awards==
He has honorary doctorates from the Universities of Stirling and Strathclyde.

In recognition of his public service, Falkirk Council launched the Dennis Canavan Scholarship to encourage young people to go on to further or higher education and to use their talents to help others.

==Personal life==
Canavan&#x27;s marriage to Elnor Canavan ended in divorce. They had four children, all of whom predeceased him; he also has a son with his partner.

==Autobiography==
His autobiography, &quot;Let the People Decide&quot;, was published by Birlinn in September 2009. ()

<doc id="415673" wikidata="Q333235" url="?curid=415673" title="Iris Robinson">
<text>Iris Robinson (née Collins; born 6 September 1949) is a former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician in Northern Ireland.
She is married to Peter Robinson, who was First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2008 to 2016.

Robinson was first elected councillor for Castlereagh Borough Council in 1989, and served as Mayor in 1992 and 1995. She was a member of the Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue from 1995 to 1997. In 1998 she was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the Democratic Unionist Party as member for Strangford, acting as Deputy Whip and health spokesperson. She was elected as DUP Member of Parliament for Strangford at the 2001 general election, replacing the Ulster Unionist Party&#x27;s John Taylor. She was re-elected at the 2005 general election.

Robinson describes herself as a born-again Christian, and has publicly stated that &quot;the government has the responsibility to uphold God&#x27;s laws&quot;. In light of this, she was criticised for her views on homosexuality in 2008.

In December 2009, Robinson announced that she would leave politics and withdraw from public life following prolonged periods of mental illness.
In January 2010, it emerged that Robinson had an extramarital affair with a 19-year-old in 2008, and she and her husband were faced with allegations of financial impropriety related to the affair. It was announced on 9 January 2010 that her membership of the DUP had been terminated, and that she would stand down from elected office. On 12 January 2010 she resigned from the Northern Ireland Assembly, and on 13 January 2010, she resigned from the House of Commons and from Castlereagh Borough Council.

==Personal life==
The oldest of seven children, Iris Collins was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland to Mary McCarten and Joseph Collins, an English soldier. She grew up in a working-class area in the east of the city. She describes herself as a born again Christian and attends Metropolitan Tabernacle Church in Belfast. She comes from family with a mixed religious background as ten of her first cousins are Roman Catholics. She attended Cregagh Primary School, Knockbreda Intermediate School and Cregagh Technical College before becoming a secretary.

She married Peter Robinson on 26 July 1970. They were the first husband and wife ever to represent Northern Ireland constituencies in Parliament at the same time. They have three grown-up children: Jonathan, Gareth and Rebekah. Gareth Robinson is also a former Councillor on Castlereagh Borough Council.

Outside politics Robinson listed her interests as charity fundraising for multiple sclerosis, interior design and horseriding.

==Political career==
Robinson was first elected councillor for Castlereagh (borough) in 1989. She became the Council&#x27;s first woman mayor in 1992 and served as mayor again in 1995. She was a member of the Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue from 1995 to 1997. She was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998, representing the constituency of Strangford. She acted as the DUP health spokesperson.

Robinson was elected as the DUP Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Strangford at the 2001 general election, replacing the Ulster Unionist Party&#x27;s John Taylor. She was re-elected at the 2005 general election.

Since taking up her seat in the House of Commons, Robinson has voted in 32 per cent of votes in parliament, below the average among MPs. In her maiden speech she spoke about the &quot;betrayal&quot; felt by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, criticising the Government&#x27;s policy on policing.

Robinson&#x27;s voting record shows that she voted strongly against introducing foundation hospitals, very strongly for the Iraq War, moderately for an investigation into said war, voted moderately against LGBT rights, and never voted on transparent Parliament or on replacing Trident. Robinson also voted for Labour&#x27;s 42-day terror detention, part of the Counter-Terrorism Bill.

Robinson was suspended from Stormont for a day on 19 November 2007 after refusing to withdraw &quot;unparliamentary&quot; comments she had made about the health minister, Michael McGimpsey.

In an interview with the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; in April 2008, anticipating becoming &quot;First Lady&quot; of Northern Ireland, Iris spoke out against Hillary Clinton alluding to her husband&#x27;s affair with Monica Lewinsky: &quot;No woman would put up with what she tolerated from her husband when he was president. She was thinking only of her future political career. It&#x27;s all about power and not principle.&quot;

==Comments about homosexuality==
In June 2008, shortly after a physical assault on a homosexual man in Northern Ireland, she made comments on the BBC Radio Ulster&#x27;s &quot;The Nolan Show&quot; offering to recommend homosexuals to psychiatric counselling. While condemning the attack, she called homosexuality an &quot;abomination&quot; that made her feel &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;nauseous&quot;, and offered to refer homosexuals to a psychiatrist she knew. In a subsequent interview, Robinson defended her views and denied prejudice against homosexuals, saying that &quot;just as a murderer can be redeemed by the blood of Christ, so can a homosexual... If anyone takes issue, they&#x27;re taking issue with the word of God&quot;. Her comments were rebuffed by representatives of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Rainbow Project, the Alliance Party, Sinn Féin, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party. The psychiatrist in question, Dr. Paul Miller later resigned as her adviser and stood down from his post of consultant psychiatrist at Belfast&#x27;s Mater hospital. He is no longer a consultant psychiatrist within the NHS and has been reported to the General Medical Council (GMC). A police investigation followed these comments, over 100 complaints were made, and gay rights activist Robert Toner also made a complaint to the Equality Commission.

Robinson subsequently repeated her views in parliamentary session. Speaking in a 17 June 2008 Northern Ireland Grand Committee session on &quot;Risk Assessment and Management of Sex Offenders&quot;, she said: &quot;There can be no viler act, apart from homosexuality and sodomy, than sexually abusing innocent children.&quot; She reiterated her statement to the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; on 21 June 2008, but later stated that she had been &quot;misrepresented&quot; in &quot;Hansard&quot;. This statement was challenged when Alliance Party Executive Director Gerry Lynch confirmed with &quot;Hansard&quot; staff that Robinson&#x27;s comments were in fact correctly quoted. Further controversy was caused on 17 July 2008 when on &quot;The Nolan Show&quot; Robinson stated &quot;it is the government&#x27;s responsibility to uphold God&#x27;s law&quot;. In the Northern Ireland Assembly on 30 June 2008, in a discussion about &quot;LGBT Groups: Mental-Health Needs&quot;, Robinson said that &quot;Homosexuality, like all sin, is an abomination&quot;, and suggested that teenagers needed help deciding whether they were homosexual or heterosexual. During this period, Robinson herself was having an extra-marital affair with a 19-year-old man.

By late July 2008, the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;[A]lmost 11,000 people have signed a petition calling on British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reprimand DUP MP Iris Robinson over her controversial remarks about homosexuality&quot; and &quot;[Fewer than] 30 people have signed an opposing petition calling on the Prime Minister to allow the comments to go un-reprimanded as a matter of personal opinion and religion&quot;. As a result of her comments, Robinson was named &quot;Bigot of the Year&quot; for 2008 by Stonewall.

==Parliamentary expenses==
In April 2009, both Iris and Peter Robinson came under fire after Commons MPs&#x27; expenses accounts were leaked to the press. The couple were described as the &quot;swish family Robinson&quot; by the &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot; after claims that they were receiving £571,939.41 a year in various salaries and expenses.

==Extramarital affair and financial investigation==

On 28 December 2009, and immediately prior to the airing of an investigative BBC programme looking at her personal life and financial dealings, Robinson announced her decision to retire from politics after claiming that she had been suffering serious bouts of stress and depression. At the time she said the stress and strain of public life came at a cost, and that her health had suffered.

On 6 January 2010, Robinson issued a statement in which she said that she had attempted suicide on 1 March 2009. BBC&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight&quot; programme revealed on 7 January 2010 that Robinson had had an affair with Kirk McCambley, who was 19 years old at the time. It is also alleged that she encouraged friends to provide financial backing to assist her lover in a business venture. According to a BBC investigation, the payments she arranged from two property developers to McCambley were £50,000. As the £50,000 was not declared to the Northern Ireland Assembly, this action broke the law. Robinson subsequently asked McCambley for £5,000 in cash; as well as a cheque made out to Dundonald&#x27;s Light &#x27;n Life Church, where Peter Robinson&#x27;s sister, Rev. Pat Herron is pastor. It is alleged that Peter pressed his wife to return this money – however, he did not inform the proper authorities about the large monetary transactions, which is a breach of his duty and responsibility as First Minister of Northern Ireland. Reports have been made of further affairs, with among others, Kirk McCambley&#x27;s father Billy, who died in 2008.

Robinson&#x27;s intention to retire from elected office was announced on 11 January 2010 and she resigned on 13 January 2010.

Castlereagh Borough Council announced on 14 January 2010 that it had voted to carry out an external investigation in the catering contract awarded to Kirk McCambley. Terms of reference for the investigation include identifying if the Council incurred any financial loss and whether officers and elected representatives complied with the requirements of all relevant local government legislation and guidance in the awarding the lease for the Lock-Keeper&#x27;s Inn. On 26 May 2011, the DUP announced that an independent investigation has &quot;cleared Iris Robinson of any wrongdoing in connection with the awarding of a contract to her former teenage lover&quot;, though the findings of the investigative report have not been publicly circulated.

The PSNI announced on 21 January 2010 that they were to conduct an investigation into Iris Robinson&#x27;s financial affairs. On 20 February 2010 officers from PSNI searched the offices of Castlereagh Borough Council as part of this investigation. On 25 June 2010, it became public that Robinson had been interviewed as part of a police investigation over money she obtained from two developers.
Robinson reportedly received &quot;acute psychiatric treatment&quot; and was under 24-hour suicide watch following the BBC &quot;Spotlight&quot; documentary.

==Later years==
It was reported that Robinson had been receiving psychiatric treatment in a London clinic from January 2010 and returned to Northern Ireland on 19 September 2010 to continue treatment.

Robinson made her first appearance in public almost seven months after her return, at the funeral of her mother at Bethany Free Presbyterian Church in County Armagh on 14 April 2011. Among the mourners was deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness who embraced Robinson on the steps of the church.

Her husband stated his wife was too ill to attend the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011. Robinson did, however, attend the state banquet in Dublin during the Queen&#x27;s visit to the Republic of Ireland 20 days later on 18 May 2011.

On 8 November 2019, an opera featuring Robinson&#x27;s homophobic views was staged in Belfast. &quot;Abomination, A DUP Opera&quot;, composed by Conor Mitchell, opened the 2019 Outburst Queer Arts Festival at the Lyric Theatre. It toured Belfast and Dublin in 2022, before receiving its London premiere at the Southbank Arts Centre in May 2023.

<doc id="415674" wikidata="Q583528" url="?curid=415674" title="Ear candling">
<text>Ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is a pseudoscientific alternative medicine practice claiming to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal. Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective and does not functionally remove earwax or toxicants, despite product design contributing to that impression.

==Procedure==
One end of a cylinder or cone of waxed cloth is lit, and the other is placed into the subject&#x27;s ear. The flame is cut back occasionally with scissors and extinguished between five and ten centimeters (two to four inches) from the subject.

The subject lies on one side with the treated ear uppermost and the candle vertical. The candle can be stuck through a paper plate or aluminium pie tin to protect against any hot wax or ash falling onto the subject. Another way to perform ear candling involves the subject lying face up with the ear candle extending out to the side with a forty-five-degree upward slant. A dish of water is placed next to the subject under the ear candle.

Proponents claim that the flame creates negative pressure, drawing wax and debris out of the ear canal, which appears as a dark residue.

An ear candling session lasts up to one hour, during which one or two ear candles may be burned for each ear.

Treatment is also performed by some naturopaths in Canada, although import and sale are prohibited by Health Canada. Jonathan Jarry from the Office for Science and Society says that the &quot;Association des naturopathes agréés du Québec&quot; (ANAQ) states in its code of ethics that &quot;its members can only use natural health products that conform to the rule of Health Canada&quot;. Results from an inquiry performed by Jarry showed that out of 50 naturopaths in Quebec, two offered the treatment and five said the consumer should buy the candles and do it himself. Only one said that the use of ear candles is unethical.

The conventional removal of earwax in medicine is done through an apparatus which creates a vacuum with which a doctor can remove excess earwax through suction. If the patient has a skin problem or the earwax is too sticky, an oil can be used to solubilise it so that excess earwax can be wiped off without inserting any object into the ear canal such as a cotton swab, which can damage the ear canal.

==Safety and effectiveness==
Professor of Complementary Medicine Edzard Ernst wrote about ear candles: &quot;There is no data to suggest that it is effective for any condition. Furthermore, ear candles have been associated with ear injuries. The inescapable conclusion is that ear candles do more harm than good. Their use should be discouraged.&quot;

According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ear candling is sometimes promoted with claims that the practice can &quot;purify the blood&quot; or &quot;cure&quot; cancer. Health Canada has determined the candles have no effect on the ear, and no health benefit; instead they create risk of injury, especially when used on children. In October 2007, US FDA issued an alert identifying ear candles (also known as ear cones or auricular candles) as &quot;dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration, prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof... since the use of a lit candle in the proximity of a person&#x27;s face would carry a high risk of causing potentially severe skin/hair burns and middle ear damage.&quot;

A 2007 paper in the journal &quot;Canadian Family Physician&quot; concludes:

A 2007 paper in &quot;American Family Physician&quot; said:


The Spokane Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic conducted a research study in 1996 which concluded that ear candling does not produce negative pressure and was ineffective in removing wax from the ear canal. Several studies have shown that ear candles produce the same residue — which is simply candle wax and soot — when burnt without ear insertion.

At least two house fires (one fatal) have been caused by accidents during ear candling.

A survey of ear, nose and throat surgeons found some who had treated people with complications from ear candling, and that burns were the most common.

== Product regulations ==
In Europe, some ear candles bear the CE mark (93/42/EEC), though they are mostly self-issued by the manufacturer. This mark indicates that the device is designed and manufactured so as not to compromise the safety of patients, but no independent testing is required as proof.

While ear candles are widely available in the US, selling or importing them with medical claims is illegal.

In a report, Health Canada states &quot;There is no scientific proof to support claims that ear candling provides medical benefits... However, there is plenty of proof that ear candling is dangerous&quot;. It says that while some people claim to be selling the candles &quot;for entertainment purposes only&quot;, the Canadian government maintains that there is no reasonable non-medical use, and hence any sale of the devices is illegal in Canada.

== Origin ==
Ear candle manufacturer Biosun refers to them as &quot;Hopi&quot; ear candles, but there is no such treatment within traditional Hopi healing practices. Vanessa Charles, public relations officer for the Hopi Tribal Council, has stated that ear candling &quot;is not and has never been a practice conducted by the Hopi tribe or the Hopi people.&quot; The Hopi tribe has repeatedly asked Biosun to stop using the Hopi name. Biosun ignored the request for over a decade until sometime after 2014 when the product was rebranded as &quot;traditional earcandles&quot; in Germany although the product is still marketed by third-party US resellers as &quot;Hopi&quot;.

Many advocates of ear candles claim that the treatment originates from traditional Chinese, Egyptian, or North American medicine. The mythical city of Atlantis is also reported to be the origin of this practice, which have no documentation. The earliest records state that it was first practice by Americans in the 20th century from some European immigrants. It developed largely in Arizona.

<doc id="415675" wikidata="Q333036" url="?curid=415675" title="Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)">
<text>Peter David Robinson (born 29 December 1948) is a retired Northern Irish politician who served as First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2008 until 2016 and Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from 2008 until 2015. Until his retirement in 2016, Robinson was involved in Northern Irish politics for over 40 years, being a founding member of the DUP along with Ian Paisley.

Robinson served in the role of General Secretary of the DUP from 1975, a position which he held until 1979 and which afforded him the opportunity to exert extraordinary influence within the fledgeling party. In 1977, Robinson was elected as a councillor for the Castlereagh Borough Council in Dundonald, and in 1979, he became one of the youngest Members of Parliament (MP) when he was narrowly elected for Belfast East. He held this seat for 31 years until his defeat by Naomi Long in 2010, making him the longest-serving Belfast MP since the 1800 Act of Union.

In 1980, Robinson was elected as the deputy leader of the DUP. Following the re-establishment of devolved government in Northern Ireland as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, Robinson was elected in 1998 as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Belfast East. Robinson subsequently served as Minister for Regional Development and Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Northern Ireland Executive. Robinson was elected unopposed to succeed Ian Paisley as leader of the DUP on 15 April 2008, and was subsequently confirmed as First Minister of Northern Ireland on 5 June 2008.

In January 2010, following a scandal involving his wife Iris, Robinson temporarily handed over his duties as First Minister to Arlene Foster under the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 2006. Following a police investigation, which recommended that Robinson should not be prosecuted following allegations made by the BBC in relation to the scandal, he resumed his duties as First Minister. The Official Assembly Commissioner&#x27;s Investigation and Report cleared Robinson of any wrongdoing.

In September 2015, Robinson again stood aside to allow Arlene Foster to become acting First Minister after his bid to adjourn the assembly was rejected. His action was a response to a murder for which a member of Sinn Féin, a party in the Northern Ireland Executive, had been questioned. He resumed his duties on 20 October 2015. On 19 November 2015, he announced that he would be stepping down as First Minister and as leader of the DUP. Robinson subsequently stepped down as First Minister on 11 January 2016 and has now fully retired from frontline politics.

==Background==
Peter David Robinson was born on 29 December 1948 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the son of Sheila and David McCrea Robinson.

Robinson was educated at Annadale Grammar School and Castlereagh College, now part of the Belfast Metropolitan College. In 1966 Robinson first heard Ian Paisley speak at a rally at Ulster Hall and shortly afterwards left school to devote himself to the Protestant fundamentalist cause. Robinson considered joining the Royal Ulster Constabulary but instead he joined the Lagan Valley unit of the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV), a paramilitary organisation tied to Ian Paisley&#x27;s Free Presbyterian Church. Robinson also joined the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee. As a young man Robinson embraced a populist anti-Catholic fundamentalism; a former classmate alleged Robinson and a friend harassed a pair of Catholic nuns in the street in Portrush, County Antrim, yelling &quot;Popehead, Popehead&quot;. Robinson initially gained employment as an estate agent for R.J. McConnell &amp; Co and later with Alex, Murdoch &amp; Deane in Belfast, and then he became the DUP&#x27;s first general secretary in 1975.

==Political career==

===Member of the DUP===
Robinson had by 1970 come to Paisley&#x27;s notice after writing a pamphlet called &quot;The North Answers Back&quot; which attacked the Northern Ireland civil rights movement and defended the Stormont government. Robinson became chairman of the Lagan Valley branch of the DUP&#x27;s predecessor the Protestant Unionist Party upon its formation. In 1970 he was prominent in Paisley&#x27;s campaign to win the North Antrim seat in the 1970 UK general election Robinson and for a time served as Paisley&#x27;s private secretary. In 1971 Robinson was a founding member of the DUP and was General Secretary of the DUP between 1975 and 1979. He had previously shared the post of honorary secretary of the party on an unpaid basis with Desmond Boal. Robinson was active in the 1974 Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike against the Sunningdale Agreement, which had been signed in December 1973. A senior loyalist politician recalled walking into the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council HQ on Hawthornden Road to find Peter Robinson and Jim Allister &quot;giggling&quot;, phoning SDLP headquarters claiming to be Catholics in distress in a loyalist area afflicted by the strike and asking the SDLP to send a car to rescue them. He was campaign manager for East Belfast MP William Craig in the 1974 general election but the relationship was short-lived. He first stood in the election to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention on 1 May 1975 in Belfast, East. Although he started in fifth place, he failed to get elected and was overtaken by his running mate Eileen Paisley.

Robinson was elected as a councillor for Castlereagh Borough Council for the Castlereagh C area in the local government elections on 18 May 1977, a seat he held until his resignation from the council on 2 July 2007.

===Member of Parliament and Executive Minister===
Robinson was selected as DUP candidate for Belfast East during the 1979 general election, a seat which previously had a big Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) majority. He won the seat with a 19.9% swing to the DUP and a majority of 64, with Alliance Party leader Oliver Napier 928 votes behind, unseating the MP former Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party leader and UUP candidate William Craig on 3 May 1979. The main plank of Robinson&#x27;s campaign was that he was the only candidate in the constituency who totally opposed power-sharing with the SDLP.

He was re-elected to the House of Commons in 1983, 1986 (along with other unionist MPs, he resigned his seat in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 17 December 1985 and was re-elected in the by-election the next year), 1987, 1992, 2001 and 2005. In the 2010 UK general election he lost Belfast East to Naomi Long of the Alliance Party.

Robinson served on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee from 1997 to July 2005.

In the general election on 7 June 2001, Robinson&#x27;s wife, Iris, joined him in Parliament as MP for Strangford.

===Leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party===
Robinson&#x27;s electoral success was marked when he was elected Deputy Leader of the DUP in 1980. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for Belfast East on 20 October 1982 where he served as Chairman of the Environment Committee until it was dissolved in 1986.

In 1986 he was involved, alongside other DUP leaders, in the launch of Ulster Resistance at the Ulster Hall, an event chaired by the DUP. Robinson was later photographed wearing a beret at an Ulster Resistance rally. The DUP later severed links with Ulster Resistance in 1987.

Robinson resigned briefly as DUP Deputy Leader in 1987 when the &quot;Task Force Report&quot;, written jointly with UUP members Harold McCusker MP and Frank Millar and calling for a strategic unionist rethink in the wake of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was rejected by their respective leaders, Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux.

He was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum on 30 May 1996 and served in it until it completed its work in 1998. On 25 June 1998, he was elected MLA for Belfast East in the Northern Ireland Assembly election. He was subsequently re-elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2003 and again in 2007.

Robinson was Minister for Regional Development, which has overall responsibility for the Department for Regional Development (DRD), between 29 November 1999 to 27 July 2000 and 24 October 2001 to 11 October 2002. He was responsible for the introduction of free fares on public transport for the elderly and helped formulate the 25-year Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland and devise the 10-year Regional Transport Strategy.

Robinson was Minister of Finance and Personnel from 8 May 2007 to June 2008.

On 4 March 2008, Ian Paisley announced that he would step down as Leader of the DUP and First Minister that May. On 14 April 2008, Robinson was nominated unanimously by the DUP MLAs as leader-designate with Nigel Dodds as deputy leader-designate and on 17 April 2008 they were both ratified by the DUP&#x27;s 120-member executive committee. He formally became leader on 31 May 2008.

===First Minister of Northern Ireland===
As he was nominated by the largest party, Robinson was ratified by the Northern Ireland Assembly as First Minister with Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness as deputy First Minister on 5 June 2008.

On 11 January 2010 Robinson announced that he was temporarily stepping down from the position of First Minister to clear his name over BBC allegations arising from the Iris Robinson scandal. Arlene Foster was designated to discharge the duties of First Minister until his return. Robinson faced claims that he knew his wife had obtained £50,000 from two developers for her teenage lover but did not tell the proper authorities, leading to him asking the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly to carry out an inquiry into his conduct. After an OFMdFM lawyer advised Robinson that he had committed no wrongdoing, he returned to active duty as First Minister despite the ongoing investigations by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Assembly Commissioner for Standards and Privileges. While the police investigation into the conduct of the Peter and Iris Robinson concluded in a recommendation not to prosecute in 2011, the Standards and Privileges enquiry remained incomplete three years after it was ordered by the Assembly. It was delayed as Iris Robinson was adjudged medically unfit to respond to the enquiry. The report was finally completed at the beginning of 2014, and finally made publicly available on 28 November 2014. Section 13 of the report stated that the three BBC allegations against Robinson &quot;even if established after investigation&quot;, did not breach of the Code of Conduct.


On 5 February 2010, Robinson and McGuinness oversaw the devolution of policing and justice powers from the British Parliament to the Northern Ireland Assembly, negotiating a power-sharing deal with Sinn Féin. This process ensured that devolution in Northern Ireland was able to be fully completed.
At the 2011 Assembly election, both the DUP and Sinn Féin increased their number of seats. Robinson had led the DUP to its best ever Assembly election result. Robinson and McGuinness were sworn in for a second term as First Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively shortly afterwards.

On 6 April 2011 Robinson attended the funeral of murdered PSNI officer, Ronan Kerr, becoming the first DUP leader to attend a Catholic Mass.

In 2012, Robinson was involved in the historic visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Northern Ireland, when she shook hands with Martin McGuinness. Robinson supported the event, saying, &quot;We recognise that this will be a difficult ask for Her Majesty The Queen and a significant step for republicans. The process has required us all to reach out and take decisions outside our comfort zone. It is the right decision and a step forward for Northern Ireland.&quot;

On 19 November 2015, Robinson announced he would be stepping down as Northern Ireland First Minister and leader of the DUP. Although he had recently suffered a heart attack, he stated his health was not the main reason behind his decision to stand down. He did not contest the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election.

==Political and personal controversies==

===Ulster Defence Association links===

The Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a Loyalist paramilitary group, were a decisive factor in Robinson being elected to the Belfast East constituency during the 1979 general election. Robinson had an association with the UDA that predated the 1979 election by several years. The UDA canvassed for Robinson&#x27;s election campaign, displayed his posters at their headquarters and did &quot;sterling service&quot; at polling booths. In 1984 Robinson and UUP politician John Carson negotiated on behalf of loyalist paramilitary prisoners held at Magilligan Prison on hunger strike in protest at not being segregated from republican prisoners. The pair and Ian Paisley both spoke at a large rally on the Shankill Road in support of the loyalists on hunger strike; Paisley addressing the British government, said &quot;We as the Protestant people of Ulster... say you have a right to give our prisoners safety&quot;. Robinson, in support, read out a letter from loyalist paramilitary prisoners: &quot;...often it is the sacrifice of a few that improves the life and standards for many, we are, if necessary, ready to make that sacrifice.&quot; Later interviewed about his role in the loyalist hunger strike, asked if he regarded the UDA as terrorists, he insisted that they were &quot;counter-terrorists&quot; and refused to condemn the UDA and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) by name.

Following the signing of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement Robinson tried to enlist the paramilitary group to join demonstrations including taking over towns at night. UDA sources claimed UDA members met Robinson at DUP headquarters, who would instruct his police bodyguard to sit outside the room and wait. Robinson also made contact with the UVF to coordinate strike action against the Anglo-Irish Agreement; following criticism Robinson insisted he was only fulfilling his responsibilities as Belfast co-ordinator for the protests. In this period Robinson attended rallies in Keady and Portadown where masked men paraded in military formation. In a profile by &quot;World in Action&quot; in 1986 Robinson acknowledged that he was relying on the UDA for &quot;muscle&quot; in the unionist confrontation with the British government over the Agreement, but justified the strategy on the basis that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had ignored the elected representatives of unionism and &quot;other means&quot; were necessary.

Robinson and UUP MP Harold McCusker were pallbearers at the funeral of UDA commander John McMichael, who was assassinated at his home by the IRA in December 1987. He also was a pallbearer with DUP politician Sammy Wilson at the funeral of UDA leader Ray Smallwoods, who served half of a 15-year sentence for the attempted murder of Bernadette McAliskey in 1981.

===Invasion of Clontibret===
On 7 August 1986, in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Robinson led a group of loyalists into the village of Clontibret in County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland to demonstrate the lack of security along the Irish border. The loyalists attacked the unmanned Garda station in the village and daubed loyalist slogans on the walls. They then held a parade along the main street and attacked two Gardaí. More Gardaí arrived shortly after and fired shots in the air, scattering the loyalist crowd. Robinson was arrested and held at Monaghan Garda station. He pleaded guilty to unlawful assembly and was fined IR£17,500 in a Drogheda court. There was also violence both before and after a court appearance in Dundalk, when both Robinson and Ian Paisley were attacked. Republicans also threw stones and petrol bombs at flag-waving Robinson supporters. At his trial one of the judges described him as &quot;a senior extremist politician&quot;.

===Ulster Resistance===

In November 1986, Paisley and Robinson spoke at the Ulster Hall demonstration which launched Ulster Resistance (UR), the organisation was intended to act as a protector for beleaguered unionists who were under attack from the IRA. The organisation subsequently imported arms from South Africa, resulting in Paisley and Robinson dissociating themselves from the organisation. He was photographed wearing the group&#x27;s beret at an Ulster Resistance demonstration.

===Views on homosexuality===
In the late 1970s, Robinson became widely known as the organiser of the DUP&#x27;s Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland.

On 30 October 2008, in his first extensive interview as First Minister (for &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; on BBC Northern Ireland), Peter Robinson stated that homosexuality was against Christian theology.

Robinson&#x27;s wife, Iris, had quoted the Bible which said that homosexuality was an abomination and that with help, gay people could be &quot;turned around&quot;. A police investigation was initiated amid claims &quot;her comments breached hate crime laws. No charges were brought.&quot; Peter Robinson supported his wife&#x27;s statements, saying: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t Iris Robinson who determined that homosexuality was an abomination, it was The Almighty. This is the Scriptures. It is a strange world indeed where somebody on the one hand talks about equality, but won&#x27;t allow Christians to have the equality, the right to speak, the right to express their views.&quot;

===Planning application===
On 28 May 2009 the Planning Service of Northern Ireland granted a developer planning permission for six houses to be built on land, part of which, was Robinson&#x27;s rear garden on the Gransha Road in the Dundonald area of East Belfast.

On 30 March 2010, the BBC reported that Robinson had purchased a piece of land from a developer for £5, enabling him to sell part of his back garden for nearly £460,000. Robinson later claimed that the inaccurate report was evidence that the BBC were leading a smear campaign against him.

===&quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; investigation===

On 8 January 2010 the BBC Northern Ireland programme &quot;Spotlight&quot; reported on how his wife, Iris, had obtained £50,000 for Kirk McCambley, 19 at the time, while in a sexual relationship with him. On the day before the &quot;Spotlight&quot; programme, Peter Robinson had made an emotional statement to the Press Association, BBC, UTV and RTÉ in regard to the relationship and stated that there had been no financial wrongdoing. The programme maintained that when Robinson found out about the financial aspects of his wife&#x27;s relationship he insisted that the money she had lobbied two property developers for and which she subsequently lent and gave to her lover be returned in full. It claimed that he did not tell the proper authorities what he knew about the transactions between the four, despite being obliged by the Northern Ireland Executive ministerial code of conduct to act in the public interest at all times. Later that day Robinson&#x27;s solicitors said he was thoroughly satisfied that he had at all times acted properly and fulfilled all requirements, and would robustly challenge any allegation to the contrary. On the following day, Robinson maintained that he had &quot;learned from Spotlight for the first time some alleged aspects of my wife&#x27;s affair and her financial arrangements&quot; and that he would be &quot;resolutely defending attacks on my character and contesting any allegations of wrongdoing&quot;. A series of investigations cleared Robinson.

===FAIR censorship allegations===
According to a report on the website of the Families Acting for Innocent Relatives (FAIR) non-governmental organisation, in 2007 Peter Robinson wrote to its director Willie Frazer, telling him he &quot;might find it much easier to get co-operation with political representatives if you were genuinely involved in Victim Support rather than opposition politics&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s principal private secretary was found to have been involved, in February 2010, in trying to have criticism of the DUP&#x27;s working relationship with Sinn Féin censored from FAIR&#x27;s website. UUP leader Reg Empey asked whether this amounted to party political use of the office. Seven months later FAIR&#x27;s funding by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) was stopped following allegations of financial irregularities in the group. Frazer stepped down as director after reading the report.

===Pastor McConnell support and Islam===
In May 2014, Robinson was widely criticized after he told &quot;The Irish News&quot; that he supported Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle Pastor James McConnell&#x27;s right as a pastor to make remarks about Islam. In a sermon the pastor had stated &quot;Islam is heathen, Islam is satanic, Islam is a doctrine spawned in hell.&quot; 
Robinson said that like the pastor he would not &quot;trust them&quot; for spiritual guidance, speaking of Muslims who follow a strict interpretation of Sharia law.
Pastor McConnell was found not guilty of two charges related to his sermon in 2016 - &quot;improper use of a public electronic communications network&quot; and &quot;causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network&quot;.

On 30 May, leaders of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Muslim community met with Robinson at Stormont Castle and accepted his clarification of the situation. He also accepted an invitation to the Belfast Islamic Centre.

After meeting members of the Islamic community he said he would be visiting the Centre again, a place where he felt welcome and respected.

==Personal life==
Robinson married Iris Collins on 26 July 1970; they have three children, Jonathan, Gareth and Rebekah.

His wife has joined him as a councillor, an MLA and an MP. Their son, Gareth Robinson was also member of Castlereagh (borough). They were the first husband and wife ever to represent Northern Ireland constituencies in Parliament. His daughter, Rebekah, served as his private secretary for his Advice Centre in the East Belfast constituency. Hazel Kerr serves as the office&#x27;s main secretary.

He is a supporter of Rangers and Tottenham Hotspur and has expressed admiration for former Spurs player Gareth Bale. Robinson is also a fan of his local Belfast football team Glentoran.

Robinson is an evangelical Pentecostal Christian. Despite originally attending Ian Paisley&#x27;s Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, he left in the late 1970s and joined Elim Pentecostal Church and then the Assemblies of God. Robinson was the driving force behind the DUPs secular appeal and leaving the FPCU was perhaps a part of this strategy.

He owns property in Belfast. In 2014 he and his wife sold their luxury villa in Florida and London apartment.

He is author of a number of books and pamphlets on local politics and history including: &quot;The Union Under Fire&quot; (1995); &quot;Sinn Féin – A Case for Proscription&quot; (1993); &quot;Hands off the UDR&quot; (1990); &quot;Their Cry was no Surrender&quot; (1986); &quot;Ulster in Peril&quot; (1984); &quot;Carson – Man of Action&quot; (1984); &quot;It&#x27;s Londonderry&quot; (1984); &quot;A War to be Won&quot; (1983); &quot;Self-Inflicted&quot; (1981); &quot;Ulster the Facts&quot; (1981); &quot;Savagery and Suffering&quot; (1975); &quot;Capital Punishment for Capital Crime&quot; (1974); &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; (no date); &quot;Ulster—the Prey&quot; (no date).

On 25 May 2015, he suffered a suspected heart attack and was admitted to hospital.

==Satire==
Robinson&#x27;s character on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Folks on the Hill&quot; television programme is portrayed as aggressive and constantly trying to get away from the Ian Paisley-Martin McGuinness so-called &quot;Chuckle Brothers&quot; image when he works with Martin McGuinness.

<text>The Heinkel He 176 was a German experimental rocket-powered aircraft. It was the world&#x27;s first aircraft to be propelled solely by a liquid-fueled rocket, making its first powered flight on 20 June 1939 with Erich Warsitz at the controls.

The He 176 was developed as a private venture by the Heinkel company in accordance with director Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s emphasis on developing technology for high-speed flight. Work on the project began in 1936 after testing with a modified He 72 and a pair of He 112s had shown rocket propulsion to have some viability. The He 176 was purpose-built to harness this propulsion, rather than a modification of existing piston engined-types. The resulting aircraft was relatively compact, was largely composed of wood, and in some respects relatively simplistic. It also incorporated some novel concepts, such as an unconventional reclined seating position for the pilot along with a unique jettisonable nose escape system for emergencies. In December 1937, the He 176 designation was officially assigned to the aircraft.

On 12 September 1939, the He 176 project was ordered to be cancelled, allegedly due to its unimpressive size and performance. However, the aircraft did provide &quot;proof of concept&quot; for rocket propulsion and high speed flight in general; lessons and designs cues were incorporated into subsequent aircraft such as the Heinkel He 280 prototype jet fighter and the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket interceptor. The prototype itself along with most documentation related to the He 176 were destroyed by the end of the war. Warsitz stated his belief that some material may have entered the Soviet/Russian archives. The often quoted performance data of the aircraft, such as its speed reaching 750 km/h, or 800 km/h, is drawn from Warsitz&#x27;s account, and are usually not based on sound documents. Only two true pictures of the He 176 have survived which were probably taken in Peenemünde while undergoing testing.

==Design and development==
===Background===

During the 1920s, German daredevils and inventors had experimented with the use of solid-fuel rockets to propel various vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, railway carriages, snow sleds, and, by 1929, aircraft such as Alexander Lippisch&#x27;s &quot;Ente&quot; and Fritz von Opel&#x27;s RAK.1. Solid-fuel rockets, however, have major disadvantages when used for aircraft propulsion, as their thrust cannot be throttled, and the engines cannot be shut down until the fuel is exhausted.

In the mid 1930s, the aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun and his rocketry team working at Peenemünde investigated the use of liquid-fuelled rockets for powering aircraft. The German aircraft designer Ernst Heinkel became an enthusiastic supporter of their efforts, initially supplying a He 72 and later a pair of He 112s to support these experiments. During early 1937, one of these aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight, thus being propelled by rocket power alone. At the same time, Hellmuth Walter&#x27;s experiments into Hydrogen peroxide monopropellant-based rockets were leading towards light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation, although at the price of considerable danger and limited duration.

The experimental flights of the He 112 had been subject to the close attention of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM)&quot; (the German Reich Aviation Ministry), which had become interested in the potential for a rocket-propelled interceptor aircraft. Heinkel decided to establish a secret department at its Rostock facility to pursue such endeavours; work commenced as early as 1936. Unlike the preceding He 112, the design team wanted to produce an aircraft that would be purpose-built to harness this new form of propulsion, and thus achieve superior performance from it; it would be from this effort that the He 176 would emerge.

===Design===
The basic design of the He 176 was sketched out during the Neuhardenberg rocket motor and booster tests. In 1936, the RLM awarded Heinkel the contract to build the world&#x27;s first rocket aircraft. It was decided to tailor-build the aircraft to specifically fit the test pilot Erich Warsitz, to minimise the size of the cockpit, along with the rest of the aircraft, to make the aircraft as lightweight as humanly possible. The resulting cockpit was so cramped that the pilot could not even flex his elbows while some controls were often placed in inconvenient positions. Due to the high speed range that the He 176 was designed to encounter, the sensitivity of these controls would have to be adjusted multiple times throughout the flight for the pilot to maintain sufficient control. The cockpit also featured an unconventional reclined seating position was adopted to help the pilot cope with the aircraft&#x27;s high rate of acceleration, it also helped reduce the frontal area and thereby had performance benefits. A crude plexiglas glazed section was removable so that the pilot could enter the aircraft.

The aircraft itself was relatively compact and in some respects fairly simplistic, being composed almost entirely out of wood, but did possess an advanced and entirely enclosed cockpit with a frameless single-piece clear nose. The undercarriage was a combination of conventional and tricycle gear designs, for which the main gear&#x27;s struts were intended to retract rearwards into the fuselage while the aerodynamically faired nose wheel and strut were fixed. The greatest diameter of the fuselage was only . The overall surface area, including the fuselage, was , with a wingspan, a fuselage length of , a height with the undercarriage deployed at , and a wheelbase of . The aircraft&#x27;s rudder proved to be relatively ineffective at slow speeds; during takeoff runs, it proved to be a more practical means of steering the aircraft via differential use of the wheel brakes.

The He 176 featured an elliptical wing that had a wing sweep of 40% and a thickness of 9% at . The wing had a slight positive dihedral so that sufficient stability would be maintained. The fuel tanks were also integrated into the interior of wings; a new welding technique had to be developed to manufacture these. Significant attention was paid to the reduction of aerodynamic drag. During ground test runs, it was discovered that the wings would often make contact with the ground; to prevent damage from being incurred, the wingtips were outfitted with metal bumpers.

The design team recognised that the conventional means of escaping the aircraft in an emergency situation by bailing out would be extremely difficult at high speed and possibly impossible without fatal injuries being sustained by the pilot. Accordingly, the He 176 was equipped with a unique jettisonable nose escape system. Compressed air was used to separate the nose from the aircraft, then a drogue chute was used to reduce the opening force required. After the drogue was deployed, the flush-fitting cockpit canopy was released and a conventional pilot/parachute bailout occurred. Unmanned scale mockups of the nose section were flight tested from a Heinkel He 111 bomber with positive results.

The original model of the He 176 was designed to be powered by one of the new Walter engines. This engine was similar to that of the He 112, the primary difference being the doubling of its thrust output to 6,000 Newtons, which was largely achieved via the addition of a pump to draw in propellant instead of using compressed air to push the fuel into the engine. The fuel used was 82% hydrogen peroxide. To provide more effective directional controls while flying at slow speeds, a rudder was to be installed within the engine nozzle itself. Detailed design work on the aircraft was completed by July 1937, after which construction of the prototype commenced almost immediately. In December 1937, the He 176 designation was officially assigned to the aircraft.

===Flight testing and cancellation===
On 20 June 1939, the He 176 performed its maiden flight piloted by Warsitz, the occasion being the first manned rocket flight in the world. Warsitz later described the flight: &quot;On quite another heading from that originally intended she leapt into the air and flew with a yaw and a wobble. I kept her close to the ground while gaining speed, then pulled back gently on the control stick for rapid ascent. I was at 750 kms/hr and without any loss in speed the machine shot skywards at an angle somewhere between vertical and 45°. She was enormously sensitive to the controls...Everything turned out wonderfully, however, and it was a relief to fly round the northern tip of Usedom Island without a sound at 800 kms/hr. I banked sharp left again to straighten up for the airstrip, losing such speed and altitude as I could, and during this steep turn the rocket died as the tanks dried up. The abrupt loss of speed hurled me forward in my restraint straps. I pressed the stick forward, hissed rapidly over the Penne and came in at 500 kms/hr. I crossed the airfield boundary and after several prescribed little bounces the machine came to a stop.&quot;

Following the initial test flight, the aircraft received alterations; allegedly the fixed nose wheel was removed at this point as the design team intended for regular landings to use only the two main wheels and the tail. Following an initial round of flight testing, Heinkel demonstrated the He 176 to the RLM, however, the organisation displayed a lack of official interest in the aircraft. According to Warsitz, speaking of Von Braun&#x27;s cooperation during the tests at Pennemunde: &quot;Although not technically part of the He 176-V1 project with the Walter rocket engine, naturally everything affecting it was of interest to himself and his colleagues because the He 176-V2 was to have the von Braun engine...&quot;

The RLM&#x27;s unfavourable attitude towards the aircraft was a major contributor to Heinkel&#x27;s decision to reduce his involvement in rocket propulsion efforts. On 12 September 1939, the discontinuation of the He 176 test programme was officially ordered, allegedly due to dissatisfaction with its performance and size. Only the one aircraft was ever completed prior to the termination of flight testing. After its retirement, the sole He 176 prototype was put on static display at the Berlin Air Museum, it was destroyed by an Allied bombing raid during 1943.

===Impact===
Prior to the cancellation of the programme, Heinkel had been in the process of designing a more sophisticated rocket powered aircraft, sometimes referred to the &quot;He 176 V2&quot;, which was allegedly intended for operational use. For this model, a more powerful von Braun engine would have been used, which would have allegedly allowed the He 176 V2 to reach speeds of up to 1,000 kph or 620 mph. No such aircraft were ever constructed, but because it bore the same designation as the aircraft that was actually flown, many books and websites mistakenly publish pictures of this aircraft when intending to illustrate its earlier namesake.

Some of the technical knowledge gained through the He 176 was incorporated into future projects undertaken by Heinkel, such as the He 280 prototype jet fighter.

Germany did eventually fly an operational rocket-propelled fighter, the Alexander Lippisch-designed Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot;, but this was produced by the competing Messerschmitt firm. By the time that orders to terminate work on the He 176 had been received, early work on the Me 163 project had already commenced. It was powered by a similar rocket engine that was actually a further development of the unit that had powered the He 176.

<doc id="415678" wikidata="Q337970" url="?curid=415678" title="Michelle Gildernew">
<text>Michelle Angela Gildernew (born 28 March 1970) is an Irish Sinn Féin politician from County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 2017 to 2024, after previously holding the seat from 2001 to 2015.

Gildernew is a former Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the Northern Ireland Executive. She was the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 2001 to 2015, and was a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for the Assembly constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone from June 1998 to July 2012. She was re-elected to the Assembly in 2016 and 2017. In 2017 she reclaimed her Westminster seat from Tom Elliott of the Ulster Unionist Party. In 2019, she was re-elected with the smallest majority of any constituency in the UK, a margin of just 57 votes.

Gildernew is Sinn Féin&#x27;s health spokesperson, and has been a member of the party&#x27;s &quot;Ard Chomhairle&quot; (National Executive). In the 2007–2011 Assembly, she served as Vice Chair of the Committee of Social Development and was a member of the Committee of the centre, as well as other statutory and ad-hoc committees.

==Education and background==
Born in Dungannon, Gildernew attended St Catherine&#x27;s College Armagh and later the University of Ulster, Coleraine. After graduating from university, she travelled extensively in Europe, the United States and Australia, where she worked for a year.

Gildernew is one of ten siblings from an Irish republican family based at the &quot;Gildernew farm complex&quot; (as described on Ordnance Survey maps) in County Tyrone. During the 1960s, the family were leading figures in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and took part in a 1968 protest in Caledon, County Tyrone over housing discrimination.

==Political career==
On returning to Northern Ireland in 1996, Gildernew was the second-placed but unsuccessful candidate for Sinn Féin in the Northern Ireland Forum elections for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The following year, she was appointed Sinn Féin representative to London and was part of the first Sinn Féin delegation to visit Downing Street. In the 1998 Assembly elections, she was elected MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, retaining the seat in the 2003 and 2007 elections. Gildernew has campaigned on women&#x27;s and mothers&#x27; rights.

===Election to Westminster===
In the 2001 UK general election, Gildernew was elected to Parliament as Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, defeating the Ulster Unionist candidate James Cooper by 53 votes. She was the first female candidate elected from her party to the House of Commons in over 80 years since Constance Markievicz in 1918. Like all Sinn Féin MPs, she followed a policy of abstentionism and never took her seat in Westminster in the five times she was elected at the polls.

In the 2005 election, she was re-elected and increased her majority to 4,582 votes. In the 2010 election, the Democratic Unionists (DUP), Ulster Conservatives and Unionists and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) all chose not to field candidates and she held her seat by four votes against Independent Unionist Rodney Connor.

In October 2014, Sinn Féin announced that Gildernew would be the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2015 Westminster election. She lost the seat by 530 votes to Ulster Unionist Party candidate Tom Elliott. According to the &quot;Times Guide to the House of Commons&quot;, Gildernew was popular across the sectarian divide in one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s most polarised constituencies.

She won her seat back in 2017, beating Elliott by 875 votes. Elliott closed the gap to a mere 57 votes in 2019, making Fermanagh and South Tyrone the most marginal seat in the country.

In 2019. Gildernew supported John O&#x27;Dowd&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to become Vice President of Sinn Féin at the party&#x27;s ard fheis.

===Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development===
During her time as Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Gildernew dealt with problems such as an outbreak of bluetongue disease. She also increased cross-border co-operation with the Republic of Ireland on farming issues.

===2011 Irish presidential election===
In September 2011, the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; reported that Sinn Féin was considering Gildernew as their candidate for that year&#x27;s Irish presidential election. Sinn Féin would ultimately nominate Martin McGuinness for president. 

===Support for Seán Quinn===
In a July 2012 interview for &quot;The Impartial Reporter&quot;, Gildernew defended embattled businessman Seán Quinn, saying that &quot;[h]e has been treated disgracefully by the Irish Government. Had they not tried to strip him of all his assets, including his home, deny him the ability to function in business, and routinely try to humiliate him I believe he would have paid back every penny he owed to the Irish taxpayer&quot;. Quinn, the former head of the privately owned Quinn Group (now Mannok), was declared bankrupt in January 2012. (With loans worth around €1.2 billion from the Anglo-Irish Bank, the Quinn group was exposed by its collapse and, on 30 March 2010, the High Court appointed joint provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance.)

Sinn Féin distanced themselves from Gildernew&#x27;s comments with Mary Lou McDonald stating that Seán Quinn had engaged in illegal business practices.

===2024 European Parliament election and retirement from Westminster===
In January 2024, Gildernew was announced as one two Sinn Féin candidates for the Midlands–North-West constituency at the 2024 European Parliament election in Ireland.

In May 2024, she announced she would stand down as an MP at the 2024 general election, in order to focus on her campaign for the European elections. In the election, Gildernew received 45,807 (6.7%) first preferences votes but was not elected.

==Personal life==
Gildernew is married to Jimmy Taggart; they have two sons, and one daughter.

<doc id="415679" wikidata="Q6776629" url="?curid=415679" title="Martin Smyth">
<text>William Martin Smyth (born 15 June 1931) is a Northern Irish unionist clergyman-politician. An ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, he was Grand Master of the Orange Order during much of the Troubles and served as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Belfast South from 1982 to 2005. He was also a vice-president of the Conservative Monday Club.

Smyth was minister of Raffrey, County Down, congregation from 1957 to 1963 and of Alexandra Church, Belfast, 1963–1982.

==Early life==
Smyth was brought up in the Donegall Road area of Belfast and attended Methodist College Belfast and Trinity College Dublin.

==Early political career==

Smyth&#x27;s appointment as head of the Orange Order was seen at the time as a working-class revolt against its middle-class leadership. In the 1970s, he was prominent in the Vanguard movement, a faction within the UUP. However, when it split from the UUP to form the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, Smyth chose to remain with the UUP. In 1975, he was elected to the Constitutional Convention for Belfast South, polling more than double the electoral quota.

==Member of Parliament==
Smyth was selected to fill the vacancy caused by the murder of Robert Bradford, MP for South Belfast. In the 1982 by-election, he received over 17,000 votes and was returned. Later the same year, he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, again polling double the electoral quota. He, along with all other Unionist MPs, resigned his seat in 1985 in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement and successfully defended the seat in the subsequent by election. In his paper &quot;A Federated People&quot; (published by the Joint Unionist Working Party in 1987), Smyth proposed a federal United Kingdom with the state governments of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each would be autonomous and, most significantly, fully independent from the federal parliament and government of the United Kingdom at Westminster.

Smyth was on the parliamentary advisory board of Western Goals (UK), which held a well-attended fringe meeting at the Conservative Party conference in October 1988 on the subject of &quot;International Terrorism – how the West can fight back&quot;. He was one of numerous high-profile speakers including General Sir Walter Walker, Andrew Hunter MP, Sir Alfred Sherman and Harvey Ward. Hunter and Ward both gave considerable detail to the meeting concerning top-level links between the IRA and ANC.

Having won first place in the ballot for Private Members&#x27; Bills, Smyth successfully introduced the Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland) Bill to afford disabled people in Northern Ireland analogous rights for disabled people elsewhere in the UK as provided for in the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. Smyth&#x27;s Bill received Royal Assent in 1989.

== Unsuccessful leadership bid==

Smyth ran for the leadership of the UUP in 1995 after James Molyneaux stood down but lost to David Trimble. He was opposed to the Good Friday Agreement but was considered a moderate in the early 1990s. He was condemned in 1993 by the Democratic Unionist Party for suggesting that talks with Sinn Féin might be possible. He challenged Trimble for the party leadership in 2000 and was again unsuccessful. He was unsuccessfully challenged for the UUP nomination in Belfast South by Michael McGimpsey before the 2001 general election, and went on to hold the seat. In 2001 he was elected to the position of UUP president. In 2003, he, along with David Burnside and Jeffrey Donaldson, resigned the party whip due to disagreements over the British Irish Declaration of 2003. In January 2004, Smyth and Burnside retook the UUP whip. Later that year he lost the party presidency in the annual election at the Ulster Unionist Council, polling 329 votes to Lord Rogan, who won with 407 votes.

==Later political career==

In January 2005, Smyth announced he would be stepping down from Westminster at the next election to spend more time with his wife. He ended his House of Commons career in May 2005. During the election Smyth courted controversy when he and former Ulster Unionist leader Molyneaux appeared in a photograph with Democratic Unionist Party candidate Jimmy Spratt on Spratt&#x27;s election literature. Smyth denied endorsing Spratt stating:

The candidates Smyth did canvass for were David Burnside in South Antrim and Rodney McCune in North Antrim. In the event neither Unionist candidate won in South Belfast, with the seat being taken by the Social Democratic and Labour Party&#x27;s Alasdair McDonnell amidst a unionist vote split.

<doc id="415681" wikidata="Q334322" url="?curid=415681" title="Richard Taylor (British politician)">
<text>Richard Thomas Taylor (7 July 1934 – 26 June 2024) was an English medical doctor and politician. He served as an independent Member of Parliament for Wyre Forest between 2001 and 2010. He was co-leader of the National Health Action Party.

==Background and education==
Taylor was born on 7 July 1934. The son of Thomas Taylor and his wife Mabel Hickley, Taylor was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. Taylor went to Clare College, Cambridge, and the former Westminster Medical School, now part of the Imperial College School of Medicine.

==Career==
===Medical career===
From 1959 to 1961, Taylor was pre-registration house officer at Westminster, Kingston and London Chest Hospitals in London. A medical officer in the Royal Air Force from 1960 to 1964, he was a registrar and senior registrar for appointments in London hospitals (1964–1972). Taylor latterly worked as a consultant physician at Kidderminster General Hospital from 1972 to 1995.

===Military service===
On 1 October 1960, he was commissioned as a flying officer in the Medical Branch of the Royal Air Force. On 1 April 1964, he was transferred to the reserve, ending his full-time service.

===Parliamentary career===
Before entering politics, Taylor was a member of his local health authority, chairman of Kidderminster Hospital League of Friends (1996–2001), and a committee member of the Save Kidderminster Hospital Campaign (1997–2001).

Standing for Parliament as an Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern candidate at the 2001 general election, Taylor campaigned largely on a single issue, that of restoring the Accident &amp; Emergency department of Kidderminster Hospital, which had been closed in 2000 due to cuts in the NHS. Taylor won with a majority of 18,000, defeating the incumbent Labour MP and junior minister, David Lock. The Liberal Democrats decided not to put up a candidate against him. The Liberal Democrats had previously stood down when faced with another independent candidate, Martin Bell in Tatton in 1997.

Taylor was re-elected at the 2005 election with a reduced majority of 5,250. Conservative candidate Mark Garnier took second place and Labour were pushed into third in the constituency. This made Taylor the first independent MP to retain a seat in the House of Commons in a second election since Frank Maguire in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in 1979.

He was a member of the Health Select Committee (2001–2010) and also became co-chair of the All Party Local Hospital Group, Vice Chairman of the All Party Group on Cancer, Vice Chairman of the Associate Parliamentary Flood Prevention Group, and Secretary of the All Party Group on Patient and Public Involvement in Health.

While his speeches in the Commons were mostly confined to the health service, Taylor also laid out an atypical collection of political views. These non-health policies included support for the renationalisation of the British railway system, and the availability of cannabis as a controlled drug. He also opposed the Iraq war and student top up fees.

Taylor lost his seat in the 2010 general election to the Conservative candidate, Mark Garnier, by a margin of 2,643 votes. The Liberal Democrats elected to field a candidate, who received 6,040 votes.

In 2013, Taylor announced his intention to stand for election in the 2015 general election, representing the National Health Action Party. At the election, Taylor finished fourth with 7,221 votes. He did not stand in the 2017 general election.

In June 2022, Taylor announced that his Party (now called Independent Health Concern) would not be standing in future elections and recommended that its supporters consider voting for independent candidates.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Taylor married Ann Brett and they had one son and two daughters. After this marriage was dissolved, in 1990 he married Christine Miller and with her had another daughter.

Taylor lived in Kidderminster. He died from dementia and bowel cancer on 26 June 2024, at the age of 89.

==Honours==
In the 2014 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Taylor was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) &#x27;for services to the community in Worcestershire especially to Kidderminster Hospital&#x27;.

==Electoral performance==
Taylor contested the constituency of Wyre Forest at four general elections, the first three times for Independent Community and Health Concern (previously Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern), and in the 2015 for the National Health Action Party.

<doc id="415685" wikidata="Q334603" url="?curid=415685" title="Mark Oaten">
<text>Mark Oaten (born 8 March 1964) is a British politician who was a senior member of the Liberal Democrats. He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchester from 1997 to 2010.

Born in Watford, Hertfordshire, Oaten became a councillor in local government, joining the centre-left Social Democratic Party, which merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats in 1988. He became the party&#x27;s Home Affairs spokesman in 2003. He stood for the position of Leader of the Liberal Democrats in 2006, but withdrew from the contest. He was later hit by a series of scandals which also led to his resignation as Home Affairs spokesman. He did not seek re-election to the House of Commons at the 2010 general election.

Following his retirement from active politics, Oaten published two books, before becoming executive of the International Fur Trade Federation in 2011.

==Early life==
Oaten was educated at Queens&#x27; School, Bushey and the University of Hertfordshire.

Before entering Parliament, Oaten had been a councillor and was employed as a lobbyist by various Westminster public affairs companies. He was leader of the SDP group on Watford Borough Council. He stood for the Watford seat at the 1992 general election and polled 10,231 votes, finishing in third place.

==Member of Parliament==
Oaten won the Winchester seat in the 1997 election with a majority of two, but his election was later declared void by the Election Court. The defeated Conservative former MP Gerry Malone successfully challenged the election on the basis of an established precedent which voided the result where it had been affected by a decision not to count ballot papers which had not been properly stamped.

This decision caused the 1997 Winchester by-election at which Malone stood again. Oaten won with a majority of 21,556, gaining 68% of the vote. He held the seat in the 2001 election, with a majority of 9,634 (with a 54.6% share of the vote), and again in 2005, although his majority dropped to 7,473 (a 50.6% share of the vote).

===Liberal Democrat leadership contest 2006===
On 10 January 2006, Oaten declared that he would be a candidate in the leadership election to replace Charles Kennedy, standing on an agenda of making liberalism relevant to the twenty-first century. He was widely rumoured to be Kennedy&#x27;s favoured successor but his campaign failed to gain momentum. On 18 January, he became embroiled in a row about the leaking of an email.

On 19 January, Oaten withdrew from the contest, having failed to attract support from within the parliamentary party; his sole supporters were Lembit Öpik MP and Sarah Ludford, Baroness Ludford, a peer and MEP. He concluded his withdrawal statement with the words &quot;Next week I&#x27;ll be giving some thought to where I go politically and giving my thoughts on the future of the Party.&quot;

===Scandal and resignation===
On 21 January 2006, Oaten resigned from the Liberal Democrat front bench when it was revealed by the &quot;News of the World&quot; that he had hired a 23-year-old male prostitute between the summer of 2004 and February 2005. The newspaper also alleged that Oaten had engaged in &#x27;three-in-a-bed&#x27; sex sessions with two male prostitutes. Further allegations surfaced in the media over the following days, including an accusation that he had asked one of the prostitutes to engage in an act of coprophilia.

Oaten gave an explanation for his actions in an essay in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in which he said a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; was partly responsible for his actions. In 2009 he gave an interview to &quot;Press Gazette&quot;, in which he said
&quot;Journalists ... had my story for three years I think, but hung on to it and never did anything with it. They could have made that public interest argument at any point in the three years. I had always been a Member of Parliament, but they waited until it could sell most newspapers, at the point at which I became well-known and at my most famous.&quot;

Oaten announced that he would be standing down from Parliament at the 2010 general election. The members of his Winchester constituency party selected Martin Tod to replace Oaten as the Liberal Democrat candidate, but Tod was defeated at the general election by the Conservative candidate Steve Brine.

===Retirement===
After his retirement from frontline politics, Oaten released two books, one on the history of coalition governments, and the other a memoir entitled &quot;Screwing Up: How One MP Survived Politics, Scandal and Turning 40&quot;. In 2018, he resigned from the Liberal Democrats after being a member for thirty years but announced that he had rejoined them in September 2019 to &quot;help defeat the new extremes growing in politics&quot;.

In the 2023 United Kingdom local elections Oaten stood unsuccessfully for the Liberal Democrats in the Severn Vale Ward of South Gloucestershire Council, receiving 1,435 votes.

==Political leaning==
Oaten was a member of the Advisory Board of the Liberal Future think tank until it was wound up in 2005, and one of the contributors to &quot;The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism&quot; in 2004—although he attracted anger from the book&#x27;s co-authors at its launch event at the Lib Dem Conference in spring 2004 when he refused to answer questions about his own chapter, stating that it had actually been written by his research assistant, and that he had not even read it. Within the party, Oaten had been called a moderniser in the sense that he was keen to emphasise economic liberalism and to prevent the Liberal Democrats being sidelined as a &#x27;party of the left&#x27;. As the party&#x27;s principal home affairs spokesman, he championed the rights of asylum seekers and civil liberties, condemned calls by then Conservative frontbencher David Davis for the reintroduction of capital punishment and has claimed to want to reunite all the strands of liberalism, and not elevate one above the others.

==&quot;Tower Block of Commons&quot;==
In February 2010 Channel 4 broadcast a four-part series called &quot;Tower Block of Commons&quot; in which four MPs lived briefly on different council estates in England. Taking part alongside Oaten were Tim Loughton, Austin Mitchell and Nadine Dorries.

==International Fur Trade Federation==
In 2011 Oaten accepted a position as executive of the International Fur Trade Federation. Whilst an MP, Oaten was critical of any plans to introduce legislation to outlaw fox hunting, and supported a &#x27;middle way&#x27; approach to the issue, that would allow hunting to remain legal. In 2004 Oaten voted against the ban on fox hunting.

==Personal life==
In an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live with Emma Barnett in 2019, Oaten came out as gay and revealed he was in a relationship. He was previously married to his wife, Belinda, with whom he had two daughters.

<text>Piers Rolf Garfield Merchant (2 January 1951 – 21 September 2009) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne Central from 1983 to 1987, and then MP for Beckenham from 1992 until he resigned in October 1997 following a scandal.

== Education ==
Merchant was educated at Nottingham High School and the University of Durham, where he studied law and politics. He then worked for nine years at &quot;The Journal&quot; (Newcastle).

==Political career ==
Merchant was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election for the Newcastle Central constituency, but lost his seat in the 1987 general election. He returned to parliament as the MP for Beckenham at the 1992 general election.

He was caught by &quot;The Sun&quot; romancing with a teenage nightclub hostess on a park bench in south-east London.

He resigned in 1997 following allegations that he was having an affair with his researcher. He later claimed that the whole affair had been set up by his one time assistant and family friend, Anthony Gilberthorpe, for a payment of £25,000 from the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

In the 2004 European Parliament election, Merchant stood for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in the North East England constituency at the top of its party list. He was not elected. In 2005 he was the UKIP candidate for the Torrington Rural ward in the Devon County Council election, but finished fourth of the four candidates.

Piers Merchant worked for some years in various capacities for UKIP, also, for a time, he acted as UKIP General Secretary.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Merchant and his family moved to Great Torrington in North Devon.

In July 2009 he was diagnosed with advanced multisite metastatic prostate cancer. He died on 21 September 2009.

Born Cynog Glyndwr Davies at Treboeth in Swansea, Glamorganshire, Wales, he was initially a school teacher and researcher before entering politics.

== Early life and teaching career ==
Cynog Glyndwr Davies was born in Treboeth, Swansea, on 1 April 1938. His father was George Davies, a Presbyterian reverend, preacher and minister. He grew up in South Wales and attended Aberaeron Primary School, Aberaeron County Secondary School and Neath Boys&#x27; Grammar School. He completed his secondary education in 1956, leaving grammar school with three A-levels in English, Welsh and history.

Davies then trained to become a teacher at University College Wales, Aberystwyth (now Aberystwyth University), where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA Hons) and Master&#x27;s in education. After his studies, Davies took to a career of teaching in secondary schools and institutions of further education. He taught Welsh and English at Pontardawe College of Further Education from 1960 to 1962, and also taught English at Newcastle Emlyn Secondary Modern School from 1962 to 1980, Aberaeron Comprehensive School from 1980 to 1984 and Dyffryn Teifi Comprehensive School from 1984 to 1991. From 1991 to 1992, he was also a research officer in the Department of Adult Continuing Education at University College Swansea (now Swansea University).

Davies married Llinos Iorwerth on 1 January 1962. Together, they have two sons and one daughter. The couple lived together at Crugyreryr Uchaf in Talgarreg, Ceredigion for 38 years but have since moved elsewhere. At some point, Davies changed the spelling of his surname from its English form to the Welsh form after his wife had done so to her own name; his name became Cynog Glyndwr Dafis.

== Political career ==

=== Member of Parliament ===
Dafis joined Plaid Cymru in his youth. He left the party in 1964 but rejoined in 1979. He first contested Ceredigion and Pembroke North in 1983 and finished in fourth place, a result repeated in 1987. His victory in 1992 was a notable one as he more than doubled his vote.

Dafis was a Member of Parliament for Ceredigion from 1992 until 2000, having been supported by a coalition of local Plaid Cymru and Green Party activists, the latter of which had worked with him on a number of environmental initiatives. Between 1992 and 1997 Dafis sat in Parliament as an official Plaid Cymru and Green Party MP, having been elected on a joint ticket. He agrees with the Greens&#x27; official recognition of Caroline Lucas as the first Green MP, as he was &quot;a kind of hybrid, so I don&#x27;t really count&quot;. 

During this eight-year period as an MP, Dafis voted for homosexual law reform, against greater autonomy for schools, and for removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords.

===Assembly Member ===
In 2000 he resigned as an MP to devote more time as a member of the National Assembly for Wales, to which he had been elected in 1999.

In a speech at the 2000 National Eisteddfod at Llanelli, Dafis called for a new Welsh language movement with greater powers to lobby for the Welsh language at the Assembly, UK, and EU levels. Dafis felt the needs of the language were ignored during the first year of the Assembly, and that in order to ensure a dynamic growth of the Welsh language a properly resourced strategy was needed. In his speech Dafis encouraged other Welsh language advocacy groups to work closer together creating a more favourable climate in which using Welsh was &quot;attractive, exciting, a source of pride and a sign of strength&quot;. Dafis pointed towards efforts in areas such as Catalonia and the Basque country as successful examples to emulate.

Lord Elis-Thomas, former Plaid Cymru president, disagreed with Dafis&#x27; assessment, however. At the Urdd Eisteddfod, Lord Elis-Thomas said that there was no need for another Welsh language act, claiming that there was &quot;enough goodwill to safeguard the language&#x27;s future&quot;. His controversial comments prompted &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; to join a chorus calling for his resignation as the Assembly&#x27;s presiding officer.

In 2002, Dafis announced he would step down from the Assembly at the 2003 elections, despite party leader Ieuan Wyn Jones having asked him not to do so. Soon after the elections in 2003, he announced his candidacy for Presidency of the party, but lost to Dafydd Iwan.

== Honours ==
He was made an Honorary Fellow of Aberystwyth University on 15 July 2010.

<text>The Blackburnian warbler (Setophaga fusca) is a small New World warbler. They breed in eastern North America, from southern Canada, westwards to the southern Canadian Prairies, the Great Lakes region and New England, to North Carolina.

Blackburnian warblers are migratory, wintering in southern Central America and South America, and are very rare vagrants to western Europe.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;. The specific &quot;fusca&quot; is Latin for brown.

The common name is for Anna Blackburne, an English botanist.

==Description==

Blackburnian warblers are small passerines and average-sized wood-warblers. They measure around long, with a wingspan, and weigh . The average mass of an adult bird is , although is slightly higher in fall due to fat reserves, averaging . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . In summer, male Blackburnian warblers display dark gray backs and double white wing bars, with yellowish rumps and dark brown crowns. The underparts of these birds are white and are tinged with yellow and streaked black. The head is strongly patterned in yellow and black, with a flaming-orange throat. It is the only North American warbler with this striking plumage. Other plumages, including the fall male and adult female, are washed-out versions of the summer male, and in particular, lack the bright colors and strong head pattern. The Blackburnian warbler is practically unmistakable if seen well, even the female due to her dull-yellow supercilium, contrasting with greyish cheeks and yellow throat contrasting with the dark streaky sides and back. The only other wood-warbler with an orange throat is the flame-throated warbler of Central America, which is very distinctive, lacking the contrasting blackish streaking about the head and whitish underside of a male Blackburnian. Basic plumages show weaker yellows and gray in place of black in the breeding male. Blackburnian warblers&#x27; songs are a simple series of high &quot;swi&quot; notes, which often ascend in pitch. Transliterations have included &quot;zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip&quot;, &quot;titititi tseeeeee&quot; or &quot;teetsa teetsa teetsa teetsa&quot;. Their call is a high &quot;sip&quot;. Genetic research has shown that their close living relative is the bay-breasted warbler, the latter species perhaps specialized to forage in the same coniferous trees at lower levels. Hybridization in the wild has been recorded once each with a bay-breasted warbler (in West Virginia), with a black-and-white warbler (in Pennsylvania), and possibly a wintering hybrid with a Kirtland&#x27;s warbler (in Hispaniola).

==Ecology==
Blackburnian warblers are solitary during winter, highly territorial on their breeding grounds, and do not mix with other passerine species outside of the migratory period. However, during migration, they often join local mixed foraging flocks of species such as chickadees, kinglets, and nuthatches. Similarly, in the tropics, they were found to be fairly social while engaging in migration but solitary from other passerines while wintering. These birds are basically insectivorous but will include berries in their diets in wintertime. They usually forage by searching for insects or spiders in treetops. Their breeding season diet is dominated by the larvae of Lepidoptera, i.e. moths and butterflies. They may help control the spruce budworm (often considered a harmful pest) when breakouts occur, at the local if not at epidemic level. In one study from Ontario, 98% of the diet was made of insects, the remaining 2% being spiders. Among the migratory &quot;Setophaga&quot; warblers, it is considered one of the specialists at foraging in the micro-habitat of the tree&#x27;s top canopy.

The breeding habitats of these birds are mature coniferous woodlands, the central part of their breeding range being in the southeastern portion of Canada&#x27;s boreal forest. However, their distribution as a breeding species continues broadly down much of New England and the Appalachian Mountains, from New York to northernmost Georgia, in elevated mixed woodlands, especially ones containing spruce and hemlocks. Hemlocks in particular are most likely to host Blackburnian warblers in mixed forests. It typically winters in tropical montane forests, from roughly , mainly from Colombia to Peru, more sporadically in Panama and the Amazon region.

Blackburnian warblers begin their first clutches in mid-May to early June in the contiguous United States and about 1 to 2 weeks later in Quebec. This species builds a nest consisting of an open cup of twigs, bark, plant fibers, and rootlets held to a branch with a spider web and lined with lichens, moss, hair, and dead pine needles, that is placed near the end of a branch. Although typically only laying one brood per year, if a nest is destroyed they are capable of producing a second or even third brood. Three to five whitish eggs are laid in its nest which is usually placed above the ground, on a horizontal branch. Nests usually constructed outwardly with twigs, bark, plant fibers, and rootlets; lined with lichens, mosses, fine grasses, hair, dead pine needles, and even occasionally such exotic substances as string, willow cotton, horsehair, and cattail down. Only the female broods and spends about 80% day actively brooding, with the male usually helping bring food to the nest. Among warblers, they are relatively rarely parasitized at the nest by brown-headed cowbirds, most likely due to the cowbirds&#x27; lack of success in dense pine-dominated forests. Blue jays and American red squirrels have been verified to prey on nestlings and new fledglings, while a merlin was recorded killing a brooding adult female. Sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper&#x27;s hawks are likely, but not confirmed, predators of adult Blackburnian warblers. By far the greatest threat faced by this species is the destruction of forest habitat, which some predict could cause the Blackburnian warbler to lose up to more than 30% of its wintering or breeding habitat. However, currently, this species continues to occur over a large range and can appear in stable numbers where habitat is appropriate.

<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, held on 1 May. The list is arranged by constituency. New MPs elected since the general election are noted at the bottom of the page.

During the 1997–2001 Parliament, Betty Boothroyd and Michael Martin served as Speaker, Tony Blair served as Prime Minister, and John Major and William Hague served as Leader of the Opposition. Dissolution of Parliament was on 14 May 2001.

== Sub-lists ==

* List of MPs for constituencies in Scotland (1997–2001)
* List of MPs for constituencies in Wales (1997–2001)

==Composition==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the 1997 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group, while Sinn Féin has not taken its seats. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.

The effective majority is slightly higher as Sinn Féin members choose not to take up their seats, and the speaker doesn&#x27;t usually vote. Speaker Betty Boothroyd was included in a Labour notional majority for statistical purposes.

Note:

# The election of Mark Oaten was declared void by the election court on 6 October 1997.

<doc id="415691" wikidata="Q192576" url="?curid=415691" title="Pith">
<text>Pith, or medulla, is a tissue in the stems of vascular plants. Pith is composed of soft, spongy parenchyma cells, which in some cases can store starch. In eudicotyledons, pith is located in the center of the stem. In monocotyledons, it extends only into roots. The pith is encircled by a ring of xylem; the xylem, in turn, is encircled by a ring of phloem.

While new pith growth is usually white or pale in color, as the tissue ages it commonly darkens to a deeper brown color. In trees pith is generally present in young growth, but in the trunk and older branches the pith often gets replaced – in great part – by xylem. In some plants, the pith in the middle of the stem may dry out and disintegrate, resulting in a hollow stem. A few plants, such as walnuts, have distinctive chambered pith with numerous short cavities (see image at middle right). The cells in the peripheral parts of the pith may, in some plants, develop to be different from cells in the rest of the pith. This layer of cells is then called &quot;the perimedullary region of the pithamus&quot;. An example of this can be observed in &quot;Hedera helix&quot;, a species of ivy.

The term pith is also used to refer to the pale, spongy inner layer of the rind, more properly called mesocarp or albedo, of citrus fruits (such as oranges) and other hesperidia. The word comes from the Old English word &quot;piþa&quot;, meaning substance, akin to Middle Dutch &quot;pitte&quot; (modern Dutch &quot;pit&quot;), meaning the pit of a fruit.

==Uses==

===Food===
The pith of the sago palm, although highly toxic to animals in its raw form, is an important human food source in Melanesia and Micronesia by virtue of its starch content and its availability. There is a simple process of starch extraction from sago pith that leaches away a sufficient amount of the toxins and thus only the starch component is consumed. Current processes for starch extraction are generally only about 50% efficient, however, with the other half remaining in residual pith waste. The form of the starch after processing is similar to tapioca.

Other foods sometimes mistakenly called piths include heart of palm (actually the core of the bud) and banana piths (actually the rolled up young leaves).

===Pith helmets===
The spongy wood of the pith wood plant or other similar species, often mistakenly called pith, was once used to make pith helmets.

===Watch cleaning===
Pith wood is a cleaning tool used in watchmaking to clean watch parts and tools. It is used to remove oil from the tips of tools to prevent the contamination of watch movements. A pith wood consists of a piece of pith (such as elder or mullein).

===Light===
Dried pith (which is actually the center of the leaf) of certain rush plants soaked in fat or grease, held using a rushlight, was used as home lighting. Beginning in the 17th century, it would continue to be used in this method until the mid-20th century. It saw a brief revival during World War 2.

<text>Eurig Wyn (10 October 1944 – 25 June 2019) was a Welsh politician and reporter. He was a Plaid Cymru Member of the European Parliament for Wales from 1999 to 2004, when he lost his seat, in part due to a reduction of the number of seats allocated to Wales.

He had previously been a journalist for the BBC. During 2005, Eurig Wyn was selected as Plaid Cymru&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for the Ynys Môn constituency which he unsuccessfully sought to gain for Plaid Cymru in the general election of that year.

He died in June 2019.

<doc id="415696" wikidata="Q6176319" url="?curid=415696" title="Jeffrey Titford">
<text>Jeffrey William Titford (24 October 1933 – 9 September 2024) was a British politician who served as leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) from 2000 until 2002. He served again as interim leader in September to November 2010, following the resignation of Lord Pearson of Rannoch. He was also a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of England from 1999 to 2009. Before entering politics he was a businessman and president of the National Association of Funeral Directors.

==Political career==
Before joining UKIP, he had been at various times a member of the Conservative Party (for whom he was a local councillor in Clacton-on-Sea), the New Britain Party and the Referendum Party. He was the most successful Referendum Party candidate in the 1997 general election, winning nearly 10 per cent of the vote in Harwich. Later that year he joined UKIP.

In 1999, Titford became one of the first UKIP representatives to win a seat in the European Parliament. UKIP&#x27;s then leader, Michael Holmes, resigned in 2000 amidst serious infighting. Titford narrowly won the ensuing leadership election, promising to reunite the party and restore its effectiveness as a campaigning organisation. This he largely succeeded in doing. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper described him in 2001 as &quot;an emollient man, a sort of Willie Whitelaw figure, and an ideal leader for such a fractious party&quot;. He led UKIP into the 2001 general election, in which it stood more than 420 candidates but failed to make any breakthroughs (although it did consolidate its position as the largest of the smaller parties). Titford stepped down as party leader in October 2002, in order to allow his successor time to plan his strategy for the 2004 European elections. He also wanted to spend more time on political campaigns in the East of England, where he continued to be an active MEP. He was re-elected with a greatly increased share of the vote in the 2004 European elections. At this election, UKIP also returned a second MEP, Tom Wise.

At the 2005 general election, Titford again contested Harwich. He came fourth of six candidates, polling 2,314 votes, a share of 4.6%, losing his deposit. Titford stepped down from the European Parliament at the 2009 European elections. He and Wise were succeeded as UKIP MEPs for the East of England by David Campbell-Bannerman and Stuart Agnew.

Titford was regarded by many in UKIP as the nearest the party had to an elder statesman. In October 2005, UKIP&#x27;s leader Roger Knapman announced that he was appointing Titford as party chairman for an interim period.

==Death==
Titford died from cancer on 9 September 2024, at the age of 90.

He graduated MA in philosophy and English literature at the University of Glasgow, before benefiting from a Snell Exhibition and taking the BA in jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford, MacCormick came under the influence of Professor H. L. A. Hart, and developed an interest in legal philosophy. In 1982 he was awarded the research degree of LLD by the University of Edinburgh.

MacCormick was a lecturer in jurisprudence at the School of Law, University of Dundee (which was attached to University of St Andrews at that time) from 1965 to 1967. Following this, he was a fellow and tutor in jurisprudence, Balliol College, Oxford 1968–1972, and thereafter held the Regius Chair of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the University of Edinburgh. He was also Leverhulme Research Professor at Edinburgh from 1997 to 1999, and from 2004 to 2008. In addition, he held the position of Dean of Law Faculty between 1973 and 1976, and was sometime Provost of the Faculty Group of Law and Social Science, and Vice-Principal for International Affairs.

Professor MacCormick retired from the Regius Chair on 1 February 2008 after completing 36 years as professor (and later senior professor) at the University of Edinburgh. He was accorded with the honour of a series of lectures in his name by the university&#x27;s School of Law and delivered the School of Law&#x27;s opening Tercentenary Lecture, introduced by former Lord President Lord Cullen, on 18 January 2007. He gave his final lecture as Regius Professor, entitled &#x27;Just Law&#x27;, on Monday 28 January 2008. He continued thereafter in his role as President of the International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy.

He was president of the International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy.

MacCormick was a member of the Broadcasting Council for Scotland, of the Economic and Social Research Council, of the Research Council of the European University Institute, and of the European Science Foundation, as well as of various government departmental committees inquiring into matters of public concern.

== Political career ==
MacCormick stood for the SNP in the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency in 1983 and 1987, coming in fourth place both times. He stood for Argyll and Bute in 1997 and came second.

In September 1998 he was selected by delegates at the SNP&#x27;s conference as a candidate for the 1999 European Parliament elections. He was elected a Member of the European Parliament, taking a leave of absence from the University of Edinburgh. Professor MacCormick was a member of the Convention on the Future of Europe from 2002 to 2003, drafting the proposed Constitutional Treaty for the European Union. He was voted Scottish Euro MP of the Year in 2001, 2002 and 2003 at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, and retired from elected office in 2004 to complete his Leverhulme Research Professorship at Edinburgh.

He was elected vice president of the SNP in 1999 and remained in the position until 2004. In 2007 MacCormick was appointed as a special advisor on Europe to the newly elected SNP-led Scottish Government.

== Academic works ==
MacCormick wrote numerous journal articles and books, concentrating both on law in a European context and the philosophy of law. Works such as &quot;Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory&quot; (1978), &quot;H. L. A. Hart&quot; (1981), &quot;Legal Right and Social Democracy: Essays in Legal and Political Philosophy&quot; (1984), &quot;An Institutional Theory of Law: New Approaches to Legal Positivism&quot; (with O. Weinberger) (1986), &quot;Questioning Sovereignty: Law, State, and Nation in the European Commonwealth&quot; (1999), &quot;Rhetoric and The Rule of Law&quot; (2005) and &quot;Institutions of Law&quot; (2007) all convey his particular brand of legal philosophy. &quot;Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory&quot; answers many of the Dworkinian critiques of the Hartian conception of law, and it is seen by some as showing a middle ground between the two. &quot;Questioning Sovereignty: Law, State, and Nation in the European Commonwealth&quot; (1999) examines the transformation of sovereignty as consequence of constitutional pluralism in the European Union. His final book was &quot;Practical Reason in Law and Morality&quot; (2008).

==Honours and awards==
In 1999, MacCormick was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel &#x27;honoris causa&#x27;, and was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours in 2001 in recognition of services to scholarship in Law. In 2004 he was a recipient of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement. He was an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford and the recipient of honorary degrees from Queen&#x27;s University (Canada), Uppsala University (Sweden), University of Macerata (Italy) and Saarland University (Germany), as well as from the University of Glasgow, Queen Margaret University and the University of Edinburgh.

==Illness and death==
Just after retiring from his chair at the University of Edinburgh in 2008, MacCormick was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. He died on 5 April 2009.

<doc id="415700" wikidata="Q318471" url="?curid=415700" title="Nigel Farage">
<text>Nigel Paul Farage ( ; born 3 April 1964) is a British politician and broadcaster who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Clacton and Leader of Reform UK since 2024, having previously been its leader from 2019 to 2021. He was the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016. Farage served as a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England from 1999 until the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) in 2020.

A prominent Eurosceptic since the early 1990s, Farage was first elected to the European Parliament (EP) in 1999. In 2004 he became the president of Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy. Farage was elected UKIP&#x27;s leader in 2006 and led the party at the 2009 European Parliament election, when it won the second-most votes in the UK. He stood unsuccessfully in Buckingham at the 2010 general election before he returned as UKIP&#x27;s leader that same year. At the 2014 European Parliament election UKIP won the most seats in the UK, pressuring David Cameron to call the 2016 EU membership referendum. At the 2015 general election Farage was an unsuccessful candidate in South Thanet.

After the successful referendum, Farage resigned as UKIP&#x27;s leader. In 2018 he co-founded the Brexit Party (renamed Reform UK in 2021), which drew support from those frustrated by the delayed implementation of Brexit by Theresa May&#x27;s government, and won the most votes at the 2019 European Parliament election, becoming the largest single party in the parliament; May announced her resignation days later, and was succeeded by Boris Johnson, whose government delivered Brexit in 2020; Farage has criticised the delivery of Brexit on several occasions. At the 2024 general election Farage again became Reform UK&#x27;s leader, and won in Clacton.

Farage is known for his distinctive character and style, including his flamboyant personality, fashion, and social media presence, as well as his form of British right-wing populism. He was ranked second in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;Top 100 most influential right-wingers poll&quot; in 2013, behind Cameron, and was also named &quot;Briton of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot; in 2014. He was ranked first on the &quot;New Statesman&quot; Right Power List in 2023, described as &quot;the most influential person on the British right&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Nigel Paul Farage was born in Farnborough, Kent, England, the son of Barbara (née Stevens) and Guy Justus Oscar Farage. His father was a stockbroker who worked in the City of London. A 2012 BBC Radio 4 profile described Guy Farage as an alcoholic who left the family home when Nigel was five years old. His father gave up alcohol two years later, in 1971, and entered the antiques trade, having lost his Stock Exchange position; the next year, endorsed by friends, he returned to the trading floor at the new Stock Exchange Tower on Threadneedle Street.

Farage&#x27;s grandfather, Harry Farage, was a private who fought and was wounded in the First World War. It has been suggested that the Farage name comes from a distant Huguenot ancestor. Both parents of one of Farage&#x27;s great-grandfathers were Germans who emigrated to London from the Frankfurt area shortly after 1861. His German ancestor Nicholas Schrod was mentioned in newspapers in 1870 in connection with a dispute with two men over the Franco-Prussian War.

Farage&#x27;s first school was Greenhayes School for Boys in West Wickham and he subsequently spent a short period at a similar school in nearby Eden Park. From 1975 to 1982, Farage was educated at Dulwich College, a fee-paying private school in south London. In his autobiography he pays tribute to the careers advice he received there from the England Test cricketer John Dewes, &quot;who must have spotted that I was quite ballsy, probably good on a platform, unafraid of the limelight, a bit noisy and good at selling things&quot;. Farage was active in the Conservative Party from his school days, having seen a visit to his school by Keith Joseph.

In 1981, an English teacher who had not met the 17-year-old Farage, Chloe Deakin, wrote to the headmaster of Dulwich College, David Emms, asking him to reconsider his decision to appoint Farage as a prefect, citing concerns expressed by others over Farage&#x27;s alleged &#x27;fascist&#x27; views. Emms rejected those concerns, as did the college&#x27;s deputy headmaster, Terry Walsh, who said later that Farage &quot;was well-known for provoking people, especially left-wing English teachers who had no sense of humour&quot;. Farage later stated: &quot;Any accusation [that] I was ever involved in far right politics is utterly untrue.&quot;

==Early career==
After leaving school in 1982, Farage obtained employment in the City of London, trading commodities at the London Metal Exchange. Initially, he joined the American commodity operation of brokerage firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, transferring to Crédit Lyonnais Rouse in 1986. He joined Refco in 1994, and Natixis Metals in 2003.

Farage had joined the Conservative Party in 1978, but voted for the Green Party in 1989 because of what he then saw as its &quot;sensible&quot; and Eurosceptic policies. He left the Conservatives in 1992 in protest at Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s government&#x27;s signing of the Treaty on European Union at Maastricht. In 1992, Farage joined the Anti-Federalist League. In 1993, he was a founding member of UKIP. In 1994, Farage asked Enoch Powell to endorse UKIP; Powell declined.

==European Parliament==
Farage was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 and re-elected in 2004, 2009 and 2014. The BBC spent four months filming a documentary about his European election campaign in 1999 but did not air it. Farage, then head of the UKIP&#x27;s South East office, asked for a video and had friends make copies which were sold for £5 through the UKIP&#x27;s magazine. Surrey Trading Standards investigated, and no offence was found. Farage was the leader of the 24-member UKIP contingent in the European Parliament, and co-leader of the multinational Eurosceptic group, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy. Farage was ranked the fifth-most influential MEP by Politico in 2016, who described him as &quot;one of the two most effective speakers in the chamber&quot;. Reportedly, he would always be assigned office number 007 in the European Parliament.

On 18 November 2004 Farage announced in the European Parliament that Jacques Barrot, then French Commissioner-designate, had been barred from elected office in France for two years, after being convicted in 2000 of embezzling £2 million from government funds and diverting it into the coffers of his party. He said that French President Jacques Chirac had granted Barrot amnesty; initial BBC reports said that, under French law, it was perhaps illegal to mention that conviction. The prohibition in question applies only to French officials in the course of their duties. The President of the Parliament, Josep Borrell, enjoined him to retract his comments under threat of &quot;legal consequences&quot;. The following day, it was confirmed that Barrot had received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in the case, and that this had been quickly expunged by the amnesty decided by Chirac and his parliamentary majority.

In early 2005 Farage requested that the European Commission disclose where the individual Commissioners had spent their holidays. The Commission did not provide the information requested, on the basis that the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; reported that the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiros Latsis. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso&#x27;s predecessor Romano Prodi approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis&#x27;s shipping company. It also became known that Peter Mandelson, then the British EU Commissioner, had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion was heavily defeated. A Conservative MEP, Roger Helmer, was expelled from his group, the European People&#x27;s Party – European Democrats (EPP-ED), in the middle of the debate by that group&#x27;s leader Hans-Gert Pöttering as a result of his support for Farage&#x27;s motion.

Farage persuaded around 75 MEPs from across the political divide to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, which would be sufficient to compel Barroso to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the issue. The motion was successfully tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament.

In 2013 Farage criticised Barroso&#x27;s former membership in the Maoist Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party, saying: &quot;You are a man that likes fixed ideology, you probably picked it up when you were a communist or Maoist, or whatever you were, and for the last ten years you&#x27;ve pursued euro-federalism combined with an increasing green obsession.&quot;

After the speech of Herman Van Rompuy on 24 February 2010 to the European Parliament, Farage – to protests from other MEPs – addressed the former Prime Minister of Belgium and first long-term President of the European Council, saying that he had the &quot;charisma of a damp rag&quot; and the appearance of &quot;a low grade bank clerk&quot;. Farage questioned the legitimacy of Van Rompuy&#x27;s appointment, asking, &quot;Who are you? I&#x27;d never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.&quot; He also said that Van Rompuy&#x27;s &quot;intention [is] to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states&quot;. Van Rompuy commented afterwards, &quot;There was one contribution that I can only hold in contempt, but I&#x27;m not going to comment further.&quot; After declining to apologise for behaviour that was, in the words of the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, &quot;inappropriate, unparliamentary and insulting to the dignity of the House&quot;, Farage was reprimanded and had his right to ten days&#x27; allowance (expenses) &quot;docked&quot;.

Buzek said after his meeting with Farage:

I defend absolutely Mr Farage&#x27;s right to disagree about the policy or institutions of the Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility – in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage&#x27;s behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore – as an expression of the seriousness of the matter – rescinded his right to ten days&#x27; daily allowance as a Member.

Questioned by Camilla Long of &quot;The Times&quot;, Farage described his speech: &quot;it wasn&#x27;t abusive, it was right.&quot;

Charles, Prince of Wales was invited to speak to the European Parliament on 14 February 2008; in his speech he called for EU leadership in the battle against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, Farage was the only MEP to remain seated, and he went on to describe the Prince&#x27;s advisers as &quot;naïve and foolish at best&quot;.

In May 2009 &quot;The Observer&quot; reported a Foreign Press Association speech given by Farage in which he had said that over his ten years as a Member of the European Parliament he had received a total of £2 million of taxpayers&#x27; money in staff, travel, and other expenses. In response, Farage said that in future all UKIP MEPs would provide monthly expense details.

In a second visit to Edinburgh in May 2014 Farage correctly predicted that UKIP would win a Scottish seat in the European Parliament elections. Two hundred protesters heckled and booed him. Thirty police in two vans were needed to preserve order.

In the European Parliament elections in 2014, Farage led UKIP to win the highest share of the vote. It was the first time a political party other than the Labour Party and Conservative Party had won the popular vote in a national election since the 1906 general election. It was also the first time a party other than the Labour and Conservatives won the largest number of seats in a national election since the December 1910 general election.

In June 2014 Farage declared £205,603 for gifts over ten years, including free use of a barn for his constituency office, which had been declared in the EU register in Brussels each year. The Electoral Commission said that the gifts should have been also declared in the UK within 30 days of receipt and fined Farage £200.

In early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the European Commission, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as Luxembourg Leaks—that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate tax avoidance. A subsequent motion of censure in the European Parliament was brought against Juncker over his role in the tax avoidance schemes. The motion was defeated by a large majority. Farage was one of the main drivers behind the censure motion.

==UK Independence Party==
===1993–2010===

Farage was a founder member of UKIP in 1993. On 12 September 2006 he was elected leader of UKIP with 45 per cent of the vote, 20 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival. He pledged to bring discipline to the party and to maximise UKIP&#x27;s representation in local, parliamentary and other elections. In a &quot;PM&quot; programme interview on BBC Radio 4 that day he pledged to end the public perception of UKIP as a single-issue party and to work with allied politicians in the Better Off Out campaign, committing himself not to stand against the MPs who have signed up to that campaign.

In his maiden speech to the UKIP conference, on 8 October 2006, Farage told delegates that the party was &quot;at the centre-ground of British public opinion&quot; and the &quot;real voice of opposition&quot;. He said: &quot;We&#x27;ve got three social democratic parties in Britain – Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative are virtually indistinguishable from each other on nearly all the main issues&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t put a cigarette paper between them and that is why there are nine million people who don&#x27;t vote now in general elections that did back in 1992.&quot;

At 10pm on 19 October 2006, Farage took part in a three-hour live interview and phone-in with James Whale on the national radio station Talksport. Four days later, Whale announced on his show his intention to stand as UKIP&#x27;s candidate in the 2008 London Mayoral Election. Farage said that Whale &quot;not only has guts, but an understanding of what real people think&quot;. Whale later decided not to stand and UKIP was represented by Gerard Batten.

===2010 general election===
On 4 September 2009 Farage resigned as UKIP&#x27;s leader to focus on his campaign to become Member of Parliament for Buckingham at Westminster in the 2010 general election. He later told &quot;The Times&quot; journalist Camilla Long that UKIP internal fights took up far too much time.

Farage stood against sitting Buckingham MP, John Bercow, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons, despite the convention that the Speaker, as a political neutral, is not normally challenged in his or her bid for re-election by any of the major parties. He later said he &quot;miscalculated&quot; the popularity of Bercow in the constituency.

Farage came third with 8,401 votes. Bercow was re-elected and in second place with 10,331 votes was John Stevens, a former Conservative MEP who campaigned as an independent accompanied by &quot;Flipper the Dolphin&quot; (a reference to MPs – including Bercow – flipping second homes).

==== Aircraft accident ====
On 6 May 2010, the morning of the election, Farage was travelling in a two-seater PZL-104 Wilga aircraft with a pro-UKIP banner attached, when the plane crashed. Farage suffered injuries that were described as non-life-threatening. Although his injuries were originally described as minor, his sternum and ribs were broken and his lung punctured. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said that the banner became caught in the tailplane, forcing the nose of the aircraft down.

On 1 December 2010, Justin Adams, the pilot of the aircraft involved in the accident, was charged with threatening to kill Farage in a separate incident. He was also charged with threatening to kill an AAIB official involved in the investigation into the accident. In April 2011, the pilot was found guilty of making death threats. The judge said that the defendant was &quot;clearly extremely disturbed&quot; at the time the offences happened, adding: &quot;He is a man who does need help. If I can find a way of giving him help I will.&quot; Adams was given a two-year supervised community order, and in December 2013 was found dead at home in circumstances that police said were &quot;not being treated as suspicious&quot;.

===2010–2015===
Farage stood again for the UKIP leadership in 2010 after his successor Lord Pearson had stood down, and on 5 November 2010 it was announced he had won the leadership contest.

UKIP forgot to put its party name on its candidate&#x27;s ballot paper for the 2012 London mayoral election, Laurence Webb appearing as &quot;a fresh choice for London&quot;. Farage described the mistake as an internal error. Interviewed the following Sunday by Andrew Neil and asked about &quot;the game plan&quot;, Farage welcomed the &quot;average 13% vote&quot; across the country and stated that the party was preparing for county council elections in 2013, the European Parliament election in 2014 and a general election in 2015.

Asked what would happen to UKIP if the Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to a referendum on EU membership, Farage said they had already failed to honour a &quot;cast iron&quot; commitment to a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. Farage said that UKIP aspired to come top of the European elections, but Neil suggested UKIP were still seen as &quot;unprofessional, amateur and even unacceptable&quot;. In the same interview, Farage described Baroness Warsi as &quot;the lowest grade Chairman the Tory Party has ever had&quot;. He was voted politician of the year by the online service MSN.

In May 2013 Farage led UKIP to its best performance in a UK election. The party received 23 per cent of the vote in the local elections, winning 147 council seats, and placing it only 2 points behind the governing Conservative Party and 9 points ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Farage was mobbed by well-wishers as he made his way to his favourite pub, the Marquis of Granby, for a celebratory drink. He called the victory &quot;a real sea change in British politics&quot;. Subsequently, polling agency Survation found that 22 per cent of voters intended to support UKIP in the 2015 General Election.

In May 2013 Farage was interrupted by protesters during a press conference in the Canon&#x27;s Gait pub on Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile. The demonstration was organised by groups including the Radical Independence Campaign and saw protesters vocally accuse Farage of being &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;fascist&quot;, and a &quot;homophobe&quot;, and tell him to &quot;go back to London&quot;. Farage made attempts to leave by taxi but was prevented from doing so, and was eventually taken away in an armoured police van while protesters continued to shout. He was trying to raise the profile of UKIP in Scotland ahead of the Aberdeen Donside by-election; the party at that point had no representation in the country, and took 0.91 per cent of the vote in the previous election though it won its first Scottish MEP the following year. During an interview with BBC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; radio show, Farage cut short the exchange, stating that the questions regarding the incident in Edinburgh were insulting and unpleasant.

Farage said in 2013 that he had hired a tax advisor to set up the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654, a trust that Farage said was used &quot;for inheritance purposes&quot;, on the Isle of Man. Farage later described this &quot;as standard practice&quot; but stated he &quot;decided I didn&#x27;t want it. I never ever used it. The Isle of Man is not a tax haven.&quot; Farage has since said that this was a mistake: that he was &quot;not rich enough&quot; to need it, that what was seen to be fair 10, 20 or 30 years ago wasn&#x27;t anymore, and that it cost him money. He has criticised the political discourse surrounding tax avoidance as a &quot;race to the bottom&quot;. The BBC reported: &quot;The Isle of Man was one of the UK&#x27;s crown dependencies which signed an agreement on corporate disclosure at a recent meeting with David Cameron amid claims that individuals and firms are using offshore locations to reduce their tax liabilities&quot;, adding that the Isle of Man rejects any allegations that they are used for the purpose of tax avoidance.

In October 2014, Farage said that people who are HIV-positive and those with tuberculosis shouldn&#x27;t be let into the UK and that &quot;I do not think people with life-threatening diseases should be treated by our National Health Service&quot;.

Farage had previously denounced tax avoidance in a speech to the European Parliament in which he criticised European bureaucrats who earned £100,000 a year and paid 12 per cent tax under EU rules, Farage said in 2014 that &quot;most legal forms of tax avoidance are ok, but clearly some are not&quot; after he was questioned on why £45,000 of his income was paid into his private company rather than a personal bank account, and that criticism of his actions was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. In the wake of the Panama Papers leak, Farage said that the possibility of him releasing his tax return was a &quot;big no&quot; as &quot;I think in this country what people earn is regarded as a private matter&quot;, and criticised David Cameron as hypocritical, especially with regard to his past comments about Jimmy Carr&#x27;s tax avoidance.

As of 2019, Farage continued to have fees paid to him via a limited company, Thorn in the Side Ltd.

On 12 September 2014, he appeared at a pro-union rally with Scottish UKIP MEP David Coburn ahead of Scotland&#x27;s independence referendum.

===2015 general election===

In October 2013 Farage announced on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; that he would stand for election as an MP at the 2015 general election, most likely contesting either Folkestone and Hythe or South Thanet; meanwhile he stated that his duty and preference was to focus on his current role as an MEP.

In August 2014 Farage was selected as the UKIP candidate for South Thanet following local hustings.

In October 2014 Farage was invited to take part in prospective Leaders&#x27; debates on BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky ahead of the 2015 general election. UKIP indicated that it would consider taking legal action were the party excluded, in contravention of established broadcast media rules, from televised Leaders&#x27; debates in advance of the election. The 7-way Leaders&#x27; TV debate was broadcast by ITV on 2 April 2015 from MediaCityUK, Salford Quays. Of three polls taken immediately afterwards, the ComRes poll had Farage as joint winner, alongside Labour&#x27;s Ed Miliband and Conservative David Cameron.

In March 2015 Farage declared in his book &quot;The Purple Revolution&quot; that he would step down as UKIP leader should he not be elected as an MP; he stated his belief that it would not be &quot;credible&quot; for him to lead UKIP without sitting in parliament at Westminster.

On 22 March 2015 Farage was targeted by anti-UKIP activists who chased him and his family from a pub lunch in Downe, Greater London. His daughters ran away to hide and were later found to be safe. Farage, when asked what he thought about the incident, called the protesters &quot;scum&quot;.

Farage was unsuccessful in his bid to become MP for South Thanet although he came second (beating Labour by over 4,000 votes), reduced the Conservative majority to less than 3,000, and gained over 32% of the vote.

Farage subsequently announced his resignation as the leader of UKIP, citing that he is a &quot;man of his word&quot; since he promised to resign if he did not win his seat, although he kept open the possibility of re-entering the ensuing leadership contest. On 11 May 2015 it was announced that Farage would continue to serve as the party&#x27;s leader, with the BBC reporting: &quot;Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a &#x27;great success&#x27; and members had &#x27;unanimously&#x27; rejected Mr Farage&#x27;s letter of resignation&quot;. Interviewed about his continued leadership by the BBC the following day, Farage said: &quot;I resigned. I said I&#x27;d resign. I turned up to the NEC meeting with letter in hand fully intending to carry that through. They unanimously said they didn&#x27;t want me to do that, they presented me with petitions, signatures, statements from candidates saying it would be a bad thing for UKIP. So I left the meeting, went and sat in darkened room to think about what to do, and decided for the interest of the party I would accept their kind offer for me to stay and tear up the letter.&quot; He added that he would consider standing for parliament again should a by-election be called in a Labour-held seat.

A row subsequently developed within the party, in which MEP and campaign chief Patrick O&#x27;Flynn described Farage&#x27;s public image as &quot;snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive&quot; and said he risked turning the party into a &quot;personality cult&quot;. O&#x27;Flynn accused Farage of paying too much attention to advisors that &quot;would like to take UKIP in the direction of some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement&quot;, singling out the NHS and gun control liberalisation as particular issues. Raheem Kassam, Farage&#x27;s chief of staff and editor of Breitbart London was later sacked as a result, whilst O&#x27;Flynn stated that he continued to support Farage as party leader. Farage also faced a number of calls from senior figures within the party to stand down.

Following the election, a UKIP spokesman acknowledged that after a series of threatening attacks on Farage it had sent an informant into the Thanet branch of the protest organisation Stand Up to UKIP, stating &quot;in order to provide reasonable security it was of course necessary to have information from the inside&quot;, an approach he said was used by &quot;a great many security operations tasked with protecting the safety and wellbeing of a targeted individual&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the informant is alleged to have actively encouraged members to commit criminal damage. Farage had said he was the victim of &quot;trade union-funded activists&quot; who were inciting vandalism.

=== Brexit ===

==== 2016 referendum ====

Farage was a key figurehead in the Brexit campaign of 2016, which, with 52 per cent of the vote, won. Jean-Claude Juncker promptly told all UKIP members to leave the Parliament. During the campaign, Farage had made the suggestion of a future second referendum should the Brexit campaign be unsuccessful, but the result be closer than 52–48. Farage accused US President Barack Obama of a &quot;monstrous interference&quot; in the Brexit referendum debate, saying &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t expect the British Prime Minister to intervene in your presidential election; you wouldn&#x27;t expect the Prime Minister to endorse one candidate or another.&quot;

Farage initially supported Vote Leave (led by Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, supported by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove) and Leave.EU (led by Arron Banks) in their campaigns to leave the EU, saying that they reached &quot;different audiences&quot;; however, he later grew irritated at Vote Leave&#x27;s marginalisation of the UKIP-backed Grassroots Out movement, and their lack of explicit focus on immigration as an issue. He blamed this on the senior &quot;apparatchiks&quot; within the party (i.e. Cummings and Elliott) who purposefully marginalised Farage during the campaign, believing his attitudes on immigration deterred swing voters. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; quoted Farage as saying that: &quot;[Cummings] has never liked me. He can&#x27;t stand the ERG. I can&#x27;t see him coming to any accommodation with anyone. He has huge personal enmity with the true believers in Brexit&quot;.

Farage has argued strongly in favour of a British Independence Day being observed within the United Kingdom, on 23 June each year. On 24 June 2016, in a televised speech on the morning of the Brexit result, he stated, &quot;let 23 June go down in our history as our Independence Day&quot;, and later said that it &quot;must now be made a national holiday.&quot;

==== 2016–2019 ====

On 28 June 2016, Farage made a speech in the European Parliament in which he stated that a hypothetical failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would &quot;be far worse for you than it would be for us&quot;, to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He said of his fellow MEPs that &quot;virtually none&quot; of them had ever done &quot;a proper job&quot; in their lives. Farage also said: &quot;... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well I have to say, you&#x27;re not laughing now are you?&quot; and his prediction that Britain will not be the only country to leave the EU. In response, Guy Verhofstadt compared Farage&#x27;s referendum posters with Nazi propaganda and credited the Brexit campaign with causing a multi-billion loss in the stock exchange.

Farage resigned as leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party on 4 July 2016, saying that: &quot;It&#x27;s right that I should now stand aside as leader. What I said during the referendum campaign is I want my country back. What I&#x27;m saying today is I want my life back. And it begins right now.&quot; He added that this resignation was final: &quot;I won&#x27;t be changing my mind again, I can promise you&quot;, apparently referring to his two previous resignations (in 2009 and 2015). Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, described Farage as a &quot;retro-nationalist&quot;, Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, after his resignation, the journalist Rod Liddle described Farage as: &quot;The most important British politician of the last decade and the most successful. His resignation leaves a hole in our political system. With enormous intelligence and chutzpah and a refreshingly unorthodox approach, he built UKIP up from nothing to become established as our third largest party and succeeded in his overriding ambition – to see the UK vote to leave the European Union.&quot;

From 18 to 21 July 2016, Farage attended the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. After meeting governor of Mississippi Phil Bryant on the final day of the convention, Farage was invited to a fundraising dinner in the state in August where he met future President of the United States, Donald Trump, for the first time, going on to speak at a rally for Trump later that day.

Following a legal challenge by Gina Miller to the use of the Royal Prerogative to invoke article 50, Farage appeared on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; with Miller. She stated that &quot;politicians had lied all the way through&quot; and that the Referendum Act clearly said that the result was advisory. Farage accepted that it was advisory but said afterwards &quot;I just want to ask her – what part of the word &#x27;leave&#x27; don&#x27;t you understand?&quot;. Farage talked of a peaceful protest and warned of unprecedented political anger if Parliament blocked Brexit. Miller said that parliamentary democracy required parliament to debate issues and that Farage had spent the whole Brexit campaign arguing for parliamentary sovereignty. Calling his warnings &quot;the politics of the gutter&quot;, Tim Farron said the British judges had merely interpreted British law and that fortunately Farage was the only person talking about taking to the streets. Miller has previously called Farage irresponsible and has blamed him and the tabloid media for death threats against her. She stated in November 2016 that she would not take legal action against those who had threatened her.

On 7 November 2016, Farage announced he would lead a 100,000 strong march to the Supreme Court, timed for when it started hearing the Government appeal. On 27 November 2016, it was reported the march was being cancelled out of concerns it could be hijacked by the far-right groups English Defence League and the British National Party. The next day, Paul Nuttall became the new UKIP party leader after Farage decided to step aside to strengthen his relationship with US President-elect Donald Trump.

In 2017 Farage called for the departure of UKIP&#x27;s only MP, Douglas Carswell. He said in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;I think there is little future for UKIP with him staying inside this party. The time for him to go is now.&quot; There was reportedly controversy within the party over whether Carswell had tried to prevent Farage receiving a knighthood. It was reported the MP had suggested Farage should instead be given an OBE &quot;for services to headline writers&quot;.

On 20 April 2017 Farage announced that he would not contest the 2017 general election. He said that he believed he could further advance his version of Brexit as a leader of a group in the European Parliament.

In May 2018, Farage addressed a fundraising event for the Democratic Unionist Party with his main financial backer, Arron Banks, who accompanied Farage during the event, stating that he would support a bid by Farage to seek office as a DUP candidate after the end of his tenure as Member of the European Parliament in 2019. In 2018 he joined Leave Means Leave as vice-chairman.

== Brexit Party ==

On 4 December 2018 Farage announced &quot;with a heavy heart&quot; on his live LBC radio show that effective immediately he had resigned his membership of UKIP, after 25 years as a member of the party. In explanation, Farage mentioned UKIP leader Gerard Batten&#x27;s appointment the previous month of far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser and the National Executive of UKIP&#x27;s voting in a no-confidence vote to keep Batten as leader of the party. Farage argued that Batten was &quot;obsessed with the issue of Islam, not just Islamic extremism, but Islam, and UKIP wasn&#x27;t founded to be a party fighting a religious crusade.&quot; He also said that association with Robinson damaged the image of Brexit.

On 8 February 2019 Reuters noted that the Brexit Party had been approved by the Electoral Commission and quoted Farage from an article he wrote in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, stating that he would stand as a candidate for the party in any potential future European Parliament election contested in the United Kingdom. On 8 February 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; quoted Farage as saying the new party was a &quot;live vehicle&quot; that could be &quot;mobilised&quot; if Brexit is delayed. On 13 February Farage confirmed he would sit in the European Parliament as a member of the Brexit Party. On 22 March he was announced as the new leader of the party after founder and former leader Catherine Blaiklock resigned. In May he said &quot;We&#x27;re running a company, not a political party&quot;, and personally selected the candidates for the EU election.

On 14 May, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt called for the government to go into an &quot;electoral arrangement&quot; with the Brexit Party to ensure Brexit was to happen on time. Asked by Huw Edwards if he would consider such a partnership, Farage said he would be willing to work with anyone to secure a deal that gets Britain out of the single market, customs union and European Court of Justice, but said that trust may be an issue, stating: &quot;both main parties have let us down very badly&quot;.

In May 2019 British broadcaster Channel 4 News reported it had seen invoices for travel and accommodation expenses between summer 2016 and summer 2017. It further reported that these benefits, worth &quot;as much as £450,000&quot;, were funded by Arron Banks, and were not declared on Farage&#x27;s register of interests, which he should have done as a serving MEP. Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder, in her role as a quaestor (an MEP responsible for financial and administrative matters), raised the issue and this resulted in an official investigation opening on 21 May 2019. When asked by the BBC about the matter Farage replied, &quot;Whatever happened after the referendum – I was leaving politics, it happened mostly in America, it had nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with the Brexit Party, it was purely on a personal basis. I was looking for a new career and a new life – it&#x27;s got nothing to do with anything, it&#x27;s a purely private matter.&quot;

On 20 May 2019, a Brexit opponent threw a milkshake at Farage in Newcastle upon Tyne. The assailant, who was arrested at the scene, accused Farage of &quot;spouting bile and racism&quot;. Farage tweeted about the incident saying: &quot;For a civilised democracy to work you need the losers&#x27; consent, politicians not accepting the referendum result have led us to this.&quot; A month later, 32-year-old Paul Crowther pleaded guilty to common assault and criminal damage at Tyneside Magistrates&#x27; Court, where District Judge Bernard Begley ordered him to carry out 150 hours of community service and pay £350 compensation to Farage.

In June 2019, Trump suggested that Farage should be involved in the UK government&#x27;s Brexit negotiations, because he had &quot;a lot to offer&quot;.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, Farage led the Brexit Party to win 29 seats and the highest share of the vote. Among the party&#x27;s MEPs that were elected were former Conservatives Ann Widdecombe and Annunziata Rees-Mogg.

Following Boris Johnson becoming prime minister, Farage unveiled the names of 635 general election candidates for the Brexit Party, including himself. He later announced that he would not be standing as a candidate.

On 8 September 2019, Farage said that the Brexit Party should be given &quot;a free run&quot; at targeting traditional Labour voters in the North of England, Midlands and Wales by the Conservative Party as part of an electoral pact. According to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, he did not want the Brexit Party to face Conservative opposition in constituencies such as Wansbeck and West Bromwich East and in return the Brexit Party would not contest seats where the leave vote was at risk of splitting. Farage said that his party and the Conservatives &quot;together would be unstoppable&quot;.

On 11 September, a senior Conservative source said that Farage was &quot;not a fit and proper person&quot; and &quot;should never be allowed anywhere near government&quot;. The government confirmed that Boris Johnson would not form an electoral pact with Farage, to which he said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; as he was offering a &quot;genuine hand of friendship&quot;. Standing 275 candidates, the Brexit Party gained 644,257 votes in the election, but no seats.

In January 2020, the Greater London Authority granted Leave Means Leave permission to hold a party in Parliament Square on the night the UK left the EU. Farage told the crowd celebrating the occasion on 31 January that &quot;what happens now marks the point of no return. We are never going back&quot;. Other speakers included the businessman Tim Martin, politician Peter Bone and broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer. Before the party, Farage expressed support for Big Ben to chime to mark the moment at 11 pm GMT.

In December 2020, Farage celebrated the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, following the agreement&#x27;s announcement, stating that the &quot;war is over.&quot;
During the very early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, in March 2020, Farage wrote &quot;protecting us all from an epidemic should be prioritised over the economy&quot;, and criticised the herd immunity policy which was being pursued at the time by Boris Johnson&#x27;s government.

In November 2020, Farage endorsed October&#x27;s Great Barrington Declaration, which advocates focused protection of those most vulnerable to COVID-19 with the majority of the population allowed to resume normal life. He described lockdowns as &quot;cruel and unnecessary&quot;, said he thought that &quot;the cure is worse than the disease&quot;, and announced that the Brexit Party, which was being rebranded as Reform UK, would campaign against further lockdowns. The Barrington approach was conceived by Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, as well as Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Martin Kulldorff of Harvard University. The scientists were concerned with lockdown&#x27;s effects on public health and mental health, especially for the underprivileged, which they described as &quot;devastating&quot;. However, the approach has been criticised by Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the World Health Organization, and Robert Lechler, the president of the British Academy of Medical Sciences.

In 2020, Farage established a financial newsletter, &quot;Fortune and Freedom&quot;, which describes itself as &quot;unregulated product published by Southbank Investment Research Limited&quot;. On 28 March 2021, Dutch Green Business announced Farage had been appointed to the firm&#x27;s advisory board. The newsletter discusses issues related to pension investments.

In July 2021, Farage criticised the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, accusing them of being a &quot;taxi service&quot; for illegal immigrants. This provoked a major public backlash – donations to the service rose 3000% in the wake of the remarks and a fundraiser on GoFundMe raised over £120,000 to purchase a new rescue hovercraft for the charity with a suggestion the boat be christened &quot;The Flying Farage&quot;. In November 2021 Farage published an op-ed in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; contemplating a return to frontline politics, due to the English Channel migrant crossings and what he perceived as the Prime Minister&#x27;s indifference to the issue.

In 2021, Farage made videos on the Cameo platform and fell victim to several pranks intended to make him refer to various Irish republican slogans, as well as internet memes such as &quot;Among Us&quot; and Big Chungus.

Farage launched the Vote Power Not Poverty campaign to secure a referendum on Johnson&#x27;s government&#x27;s pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In September 2022, Farage introduced a range of three gins made in Cornwall.

In May 2023, Farage told BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; that Brexit had failed due to the policies of successive Conservative governments, saying that their policies meant that the UK did not benefit economically from leaving the bloc.

In September 2023, Farage was ranked first on the &quot;New Statesman&quot;&#x27;s Right Power List, describing him as &quot;the most influential person on the British right&quot;. In February 2024, Farage revealed that he was &quot;open-minded&quot; about joining the Conservative Party after the general election, more than 30 years after he left the party.

In November 2024, Farage was not invited to speak at a farmers&#x27; protest outside Downing Street, with organisers citing concerns that his involvement could politicise the event, particularly in light of Brexit&#x27;s impact on agriculture. While some close to Farage claimed political pressure from the Conservative Party, the organisers stressed the protest was focused on farmers&#x27; issues, such as controversial inheritance tax changes. Farage voiced support on social media, but many farmers opposed his presence, believing it would detract from their cause.

== Reform UK ==
The Reform UK party, a 2021 rename of the Brexit Party, is a limited company (Reform UK Party Limited) with fifteen shares. Farage owned 53% of the shares in the company, giving him a controlling majority. The other shareholders were Tice, who holds about a third, and Chief Executive Paul Oakden and Party Treasurer Mehrtash A&#x27;Zami who each held less than one percent. In August 2024 Paul Oakden was removed and Farage took over his shares, giving him 60% ownership. Reform UK is unusual in that British political parties are usually not corporate entities, but unincorporated associations comprising a leadership and a membership; Reform&#x27;s paying supporters have no voting powers.

On 6 March 2021, Farage announced in an interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; that he was retiring from politics and resigning as leader of Reform UK. He became the party&#x27;s honorary president and was replaced as the party&#x27;s leader by Richard Tice.

=== 2024 general election ===

At a news conference on 3 June 2024, Farage announced both his intention to become leader of Reform UK once again and his candidature for the party in the Clacton constituency. He previously said he would not stand in the election, but changed his mind after people had asked him to run. On his first day of campaigning in Clacton-on-Sea, Farage had a banana milkshake thrown over him by a member of the crowd. A 25-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of assault. Farage appeared to make a joke about the incident later in the day, when he appeared in front of the media in the village of Jaywick with a tray of milkshakes. On 12 June, Farage had a paper cup and an unidentified object thrown at him whilst campaigning on an open-top bus. A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of public order offences. Farage said that he would not be cowed by the incident. He was subsequently provided with private security.

On 17 June, Farage and Tice launched the Reform UK manifesto, which they called a &quot;contract&quot; (&quot;Our Contract with You&quot;). It pledged to lower taxes, lower immigration, increase funding for public services, reform the NHS and decrease its waiting lists to &#x27;zero&#x27;, bring utilities and critical national infrastructure under 50% public ownership (the other 50% owned by pension funds), replace the House of Lords with a more democratic second chamber, and to replace first-past-the-post voting with a system of proportional representation. It also pledged to accelerate transport infrastructure in coastal regions, Wales, the North, and the Midlands. The party also wants to freeze non-essential immigration and recruit 40,000 new police officers. Reform UK are the only major party to oppose the current net zero target made by the government. Instead, it pledged to support the environment with more tree planting, more recycling and less single-use plastics.

In a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; interview with Nick Robinson, Farage stated that Reform UK would lower the tax burden to encourage people into work. He stated in another interview that if he won power, he would remove university tuition fees for those studying STEM subjects (i.e. science, technology, engineering and maths), as well as medicine. Reform UK have already pledged to scrap interest on student loans and to extend the loan capital repayment periods to 45 years. Farage also declared his ambition for Reform UK to replace the Conservatives as the biggest right-wing party in Parliament.

On 27 June, an undercover Channel 4 journalist secretly recorded members of Farage&#x27;s campaign team using offensive racial, Islamophobic and homophobic language, also suggesting refugees should be used as &quot;target practice&quot;. In a statement, Farage said that he was &quot;dismayed&quot; at the &quot;reprehensible&quot; language. Tice said that racist comments were &quot;inappropriate&quot;. Farage later accused Channel 4 of a &quot;set-up&quot;, stating that one of the canvassers, Andrew Parker, had been an actor. Farage stated that Parker had been &quot;acting from the moment he came into the office&quot;, and cited video of Parker performing &quot;rough-speaking&quot; from his acting website. Channel 4 denied that Parker was known to them prior to the report. Regarding other members of his campaign team, Farage stated that the individuals in question had &quot;watched England play football, they were in the pub, they were drunk, it was crass.&quot;

On 4 July, Farage won the Clacton seat, with 46.2% of the vote, becoming an MP for the first time. In addition to Farage, four other Reform UK candidates were elected to parliament; Tice, Lee Anderson, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock. With the Conservatives now in opposition, Farage has focused his attention on winning seats against the governing Labour Party in the next election, saying: &quot;Reform are now second to Labour in 87 seats in this country. We are coming for you Keir Starmer.&quot;

===Member of Parliament===

Amid riots in July and August 2024 following a mass stabbing in Southport, Farage condemned the disorder, stating: &quot;The levels of intimidation and threat to life have no place in a functioning democracy&quot;. He called for Parliament to be recalled over the riots and suggested there was a widespread impression of &quot;two-tier policing&quot; as a result of &quot;soft policing&quot; during Black Lives Matter protests, which he said contributed to a &quot;sense of injustice&quot;.

Farage was criticised by the former head of UK counter-terrorism, Neil Basu, for questioning whether the truth was being withheld from the public, with Basu accusing Farage of inciting violence and creating conspiracy theories. Farage was also accused by Steve Rotheram, the Mayor of Liverpool City Region, of giving legitimacy to acts of violence, after releasing a video in which he said he did not support violence, but that the protests were &quot;nothing to what could happen over the course of the next few weeks&quot;.

In September 2024, Farage was in the process of purchasing a property in Clacton.

In the lead-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Farage aligned himself closely with Republican Party nominee Donald Trump, meeting Trump at a rally on 4 November 2024 and attending Trump&#x27;s exclusive Mar-a-Lago watch party on 5 November 2024. Farage also travelled to attend the Republican National Convention in July 2024.

In December 2024, it was reported that American businessman Elon Musk was planning a $100 million donation to the Reform UK party to influence the next UK election. Farage said that talk of a $100m donation to his party was &quot;pure speculation&quot;, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve heard nothing of the kind&quot;. That month Farage travelled to Florida, US, to meet Musk, a trip partly financed by his friend George Cottrell, who had served a prison sentence for fraud in 2017.

On 2 January 2025, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader, called for a &quot;long overdue&quot; national public inquiry into the UK&#x27;s rape gangs, criticising the Labour government for not supporting a government-led inquiry into Oldham&#x27;s case. Farage responded by accusing both major parties of failing victims over the years and a week later announced that Reform would raise money to appoint &quot;independent arbiters&quot; to examine gang rapes across Britain if the government refused to do it itself. 

On 5 January 2025, Musk called for Farage to be replaced as leader of Reform UK. Farage suggested that this was due to a disagreement over Musk&#x27;s support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson. On 7 January, Farage said that he aimed to &quot;mend fences&quot; with Musk. Farage has frequently hailed Musk as a &quot;hero&quot;.

On 8 January 2025, Farage voted along with all other Reform UK MPs for a new national inquiry into rape gangs. The bill was lost by 364 votes to 111, a majority of 253 against the amendment.

==Support for Donald Trump==

Farage is a supporter of Donald Trump. On 28 October 2020, Farage spoke at a Trump rally in Arizona, where Farage praised Trump, calling him the &quot;most resilient and brave person&quot; he had ever met. Farage again supported Trump in the 2024 US presidential election. On 31 May 2024, after Trump was unanimously found guilty by a jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records to commit election fraud, Farage said in an interview with Sky News that he supports Trump &quot;more than ever&quot;.

==Broadcasting career==
===Fox News===
On 20 January 2017, the day of Trump&#x27;s presidential inauguration, US news channel Fox News announced it had hired Farage as a commentator. He has since provided political analysis for both the main Fox News channel and its sister channel Fox Business Network.

===LBC===
From January 2017 to June 2020 Farage hosted &quot;The Nigel Farage Show&quot; on the UK talk radio station LBC. The show was broadcast live on Monday to Thursday evenings.

Farage said on his show that Channel 4 journalist Jon Snow &quot;should be attacked&quot; for his &quot;condescending bias&quot; during coverage of a pro-Brexit protest in March 2019. Ofcom decided that Farage had not broken their broadcasting code since he clarified that he meant a verbal attack.

On 31 October 2019, the day the UK was set to leave the European Union before the approval of a delay, Farage interviewed US President Donald Trump on his LBC show. Trump criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s Brexit deal, saying it made it difficult for the UK to strike a trade deal with the US.

From March 2018 to July 2018, Farage hosted a podcast under the LBC banner entitled &quot;Farage Against The Machine&quot;, a play on words for the term &#x27;rage against the machine&#x27;, where he discussed the latest political developments and political news with political figures who Farage both agrees, and disagrees with. New episodes of the podcast were released every Friday, but the podcast was cancelled after the American rock music band Rage Against the Machine sent a cease and desist letter to Farage, demanding that Farage change the name of the podcast, which he was unwilling to do, prompting LBC to reluctantly trigger its cancellation.

On 11 June 2020, LBC announced that Farage would be leaving the station &quot;with immediate effect&quot;, noting that his contract had been up for renewal.

===GB News===
On 20 June 2021 Farage joined the British news channel GB News to host the Sunday morning political discussion programme &quot;The Political Correction&quot;. On 17 July 2021 he announced he would begin hosting the Monday to Thursday evening show &quot;Farage&quot; on 19 July.

In August 2024 it was revealed, through the Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests (external) published by parliament, that Farage was earning nearly £1.2m a year from his work presenting on the GB News television channel. Farage later said he did not get a fixed monthly fee from GB News, but was paid varying amounts as a contractor. The sum disclosed to the register was a gross sum, including VAT, for work carried out since 1 April 2024, and also included services such as media consultancy, in addition to his work as television presenter.

=== &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; ===

In November 2023, it was announced that Farage would appear on the twenty-third series of the UK reality TV programme &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that ITV offered Farage a fee of up to £1.5 million to take part, which would make him the highest paid contestant to date, in the history of the show.

Farage finished in third place, behind Tony Bellew in second, and Sam Thompson in first.

==Personal life==
Farage resides in Single Street, a hamlet in the London Borough of Bromley, &quot;around the corner from his mother&quot;.

He has been married twice. In 1988 he married Irish nurse Gráinne Hayes, with whom he has two children. The couple divorced in 1997. In 1999 he married Kirsten Mehr, a German national; the couple have two children. In April 2018, Farage said that the children have both British and German passports and that they speak &quot;perfect German&quot;. Farage has spoken of how they have been teased because of their relation to him. He has made reference to his German wife in response to criticisms that he is &quot;anti-Europe&quot;, while he himself says he is merely anti-EU. Farage has employed his wife Kirsten as his parliamentary secretary and in April 2014 he said that &quot;nobody else could do that job&quot;. In February 2017, his wife told the Press Association that they were living &quot;separate lives&quot; and that Farage had &quot;moved out of the family home a while ago&quot;.

In a BBC interview with Rachel Johnson in May 2017, he described himself as &quot;53, separated, skint&quot;, citing 20 years of campaigning as the reason for both. In 2023, it was revealed that Farage had been in a relationship with the French politician Laure Ferrari for several years.
On 25 November 1985, Farage was hit by a car after a night out, and suffered injury to his head and left leg, the latter nearly requiring amputation. He was in casts for 11 months but recovered, and the nurse who treated him became his first wife. On 26 December 1986, Farage first felt symptoms of what was later discovered to be testicular cancer. He had the left testicle removed, and the cancer had not spread to any other organs.
Farage&#x27;s memoir &quot;Fighting Bull&quot; (&quot;Flying Free&quot; in paperback) was published in 2010. It chronicles the founding of UKIP and his personal and political life. A second book, &quot;The Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything&quot;, was released by Biteback Publishing in 2015.
Farage is a keen cricket fan and has appeared on &quot;Test Match Special&quot;. He appeared in an advertisement for the bookmaker Paddy Power ahead of golf&#x27;s 2014 Ryder Cup. However, due to spinal injuries since his 2010 plane crash, he cannot play golf. Farage is also an association football fan, and supports Crystal Palace FC. He likes to relax by fishing alone at night on the Kent coast. Farage is a smoker and also fond of beer, this forming part of his public image. Farage is a member of the East India Club, an exclusive private gentlemen&#x27;s club in St. James&#x27;s Square in London.
Farage is a Christian. In 2014 he described himself as a &quot;somewhat lapsed&quot; member of the Church of England. In 2011, he also said &quot;You know, you can be Christian and fun or you can be Christian and, like Cromwell, be deeply puritanical and want to control everybody&quot;.
In January 2016, Farage told &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; that he believed his car had been tampered with in October 2015, as he had been forced to stop when his car&#x27;s wheel nuts came loose. He reported that he had spoken with the French police but did not wish to pursue the matter any further. &quot;The Times&quot;, however, said Farage&#x27;s story was untrue, and that Dunkirk prosecutors had no reason to suspect foul play or the police would have started an investigation. The owner of the breakdown garage concerned had said the problem was probably shoddy repair work, but he had been unable to communicate directly with Farage. Farage later said he had made a &quot;terrible, terrible mistake&quot; in speaking to journalists and that a Sunday newspaper had misreported his claims of tampering as an assassination attempt.
In August 2024 it was reported that Farage was earning in excess of £1m a year from his employment outside parliament, in addition to his salary as an MP. The figure included earnings of nearly £1.2m a year from his work presenting on the GB News television channel. The disclosures were made in the latest Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests (external) published by parliament. In the same month, Farage reported in the Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests that he had earned over a million pounds per year for work done outside parliament since he became an MP, an amount thought to be &quot;significantly higher than that of any other member of parliament&quot;.

===Coutts account===
In June 2023, Farage said that his account with the private bank Coutts was to be closed. He was offered a standard bank account by Coutts&#x27;s parent group, NatWest, in the closure notice he received. Farage said he was then refused personal and business accounts at seven other UK banks. When pressed by Farage to reveal why, NatWest said that he failed to meet the Coutts eligibility criteria as he did not hold £1,000,000 or more in his account following the expiry of his mortgage.

The story was picked up by the UK press. It was later revealed that in part, Farage&#x27;s account was closed because Coutts felt that his beliefs and values did not align with theirs. In an internal dossier, Coutts wrote that he &quot;is at best seen as xenophobic and pandering to racists&quot; and considered a &quot;disingenuous grifter&quot;.

In a front-page story on 20 July, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the Coutts CEO, Dame Alison Rose, had dined with Simon Jack, the business editor for BBC News, on the evening before he published an article saying that the decision had been &quot;for commercial reasons&quot;. Peter Bone MP and David Jones MP were reported as calling for Rose to resign.

Documents disclosed by the bank to Farage following his submission of a subject access request showed that the decision by the bank&#x27;s Wealth Reputational Risk Committee to close his accounts, according to the 40-page dossier, was in part due to his views being considered incompatible with the bank&#x27;s &quot;values or purpose&quot;. The dossier revealed that Farage was classed as a &quot;lower risk&quot; politically exposed person (PEP). It went to note that the bank considered declassifying Farage as a PEP on their next review in 2022. His status was maintained, however, in 2023, owing to his public profile and reported links to Russia.

Within the document, an update to Farage&#x27;s notes from 10 March 2023 stated &quot;The relationship has been below commercial criteria for some time and upon review of Nigel&#x27;s past public profile and connections, the perceived risks for the future weighed against the benefit of retention the decision was taken to exit upon repayment of an existing mortgage.&quot; It adds that continuing to do business with him was &quot;not compatible with Coutts given his publicly-stated views&quot; and the decision was &quot;This was not a political decision but one centred around inclusivity and purpose&quot;.

Rose was accused of holding ultimate responsibility for the decision to close Farage&#x27;s accounts. On 25 July, Rose admitted to a &quot;serious error of judgement&quot; in discussing Farage&#x27;s Coutts accounts with Jack, while the NatWest board said that it retained full confidence in her. Later that day, Rose resigned as CEO of NatWest Group with immediate effect.

On 26 July, Farage called on the whole of the NatWest board to resign. On 27 July, the Coutts chief executive Peter Flavel stepped down with immediate effect. Rishi Sunak supported Farage.

In October 2023, it was reported that the ICO ruled that Rose twice violated the law, as it upheld two parts of Farage&#x27;s complaint concerning the treatment of his personal data, but the ICO later withdrew the comment about Rose, and apologised to her, saying that their ruling related only to NatWest. In the same month, an investigation by lawyers Travers Smith, appointed by NatWest, found that the bank had acted in a &quot;lawful&quot; manner when it closed Farage&#x27;s account, but had &quot;failed to treat him fairly&quot;. The Financial Conduct Authority said that the report by Travers Smith revealed &quot;potential regulatory breaches&quot; by the bank. Farage described the Travers Smith report as a &quot;whitewash&quot;.

== Awards ==
In November 2016 Farage was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in the 2016 Brexit referendum at the 33rd Parliamentarian of the Year awards run by political magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

In December 2016 he was shortlisted for &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Person of the Year award.

In February 2020, an honorary doctorate of laws degree was presented to Farage by Jerry Falwell Jr. during Liberty University&#x27;s weekly convocation for his role in Brexit and &#x27;support of freedom&#x27; in Europe and the United States.

In June 2023, he won the award for Best Presenter at the annual TRIC Awards.

<doc id="415702" wikidata="Q9670" url="?curid=415702" title="Caroline Lucas">
<text>Caroline Patricia Lucas (born 9 December 1960) is a British politician who was the leader of the Green Party of England and Wales from 2003 to 2006, 2007 to 2012, and 2016 to 2018. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Brighton Pavilion from 2010 to 2024. She was the Green Party&#x27;s first MP (although Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Cynog Dafis was elected on a joint ticket in the 1990s) and their only MP until the 2024 general election.

Born in Malvern in Worcestershire, Lucas graduated from the University of Exeter and the University of Kansas before receiving a PhD from the University of Exeter in 1989. She joined the Green Party in 1986 and held various party roles, also serving on Oxfordshire County Council from 1993 to 1997. She was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England in 1999 and re-elected in 2004 and 2009, also serving as the party&#x27;s female Principal Speaker from 2003 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2008.

Lucas was elected the first leader of the Green Party in 2008 and was selected to represent the constituency of Brighton Pavilion in the 2010 general election, becoming the party&#x27;s first MP. She stood down as party leader in 2012 to devote more time to her parliamentary duties and focus on the election campaign. She returned as party leader from September 2016 to September 2018, sharing the post with Jonathan Bartley. She stated in June 2023 that she would not stand at the 2024 general election.

==Early life and education==
Lucas was born in Malvern in Worcestershire, to middle-class, Conservative Party-voting parents, Peter and Valerie (&quot;née&quot; Griffin) Lucas. She is one of three children; her father ran a small central heating company, and sold solar panelling. Her mother stayed at home to bring up their children.

Lucas was educated at Malvern Girls&#x27; College (which became Malvern St James in 2006), a boarding private school in Great Malvern. She then went to the University of Exeter, where she gained a first-class BA (Hons) in English Literature in 1983. While at university Lucas went on many trips to Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp and Molesworth peace camp when involved with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Lucas was an activist in CND and was involved in the Snowball Campaign against US military bases in the UK, which involved cutting fences with the expectation of being arrested.

Lucas won a scholarship to attend the University of Kansas between 1983 and 1984, gaining a Diploma of Journalism, before studying for a PhD degree in English from the University of Exeter, awarded in 1990, with a thesis entitled &quot;Writing for Women: a study of woman as reader in Elizabethan romance&quot;. While completing her doctorate, Lucas worked as a press officer for Oxfam from 1989; she later worked for the charity in other roles, became active in the Green Party and left Oxfam in 1999.

==Life and career==

===Early political career===
After being &quot;utterly inspired&quot; by Jonathon Porritt&#x27;s book &quot;Seeing Green&quot;, Lucas joined the Green Party in 1986. She noticed that the Green Party office was in Clapham, where she was living at the time, so thought: &quot;Right! I&#x27;m going there now, I&#x27;m just going to dedicate the rest of my life to this party&#x27;.&quot; Soon afterwards she became the party&#x27;s National Press Officer (1987–1989) and Co-Chair (1989–1990). 

When the Green Party became three separate parties in 1990 for the constituent parts of the United Kingdom, she joined the Green Party of England and Wales. Lucas served as their General Election Speaker from 1991 (for the following year&#x27;s general election) and a Regional Council Member from 1997.

Lucas&#x27;s first success in an election came when she gained the Green Party&#x27;s second council seat in the UK on Oxfordshire County Council, which she held between 1993 and 1997.

===European Parliament===
Lucas was first elected as a Member of the European Parliament for the South East England Region at the 1999 elections, the first year the election was by proportional representation. In that year the Green Party gained 7.4% of the vote (110,571 votes). In November 2001, she was convicted of a breach of the peace at the Faslane nuclear base in Scotland the previous February and fined £150 for her participation in a CND sit-down protest. Conducting her own defence at the trial, she pleaded not guilty. Lucas argued that she had a right under the Human Rights Act to peaceful protest following on from her firm anti-nuclear attitudes. Faslane is the base used for Britain&#x27;s Trident nuclear programme. She was arrested for a protest at the same location in January 2007. &quot;It still seems ironic that it is a non-violent demonstration that is judged to be a breach of the peace, rather than Britain&#x27;s illegal and immoral possession of nuclear weapons&quot;, she wrote at the time.

Lucas was re-elected in 2004, gaining 173,351 votes (8% share), and again in the 2009 election when the party&#x27;s vote under the list system rose to 271,506, or 11.6%. In the European Parliament, she was a member of the Committee for Trade, Industry, Energy and Research; the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy; the Committee on International Trade; and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change.

She held the party&#x27;s post of Female Principal Speaker from 2003 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2008.

===First period as leader (2008–2012)===
Lucas was elected as the Green Party&#x27;s first leader on 5 September 2008, gaining 92% of the vote (against one other candidate, Ashley Gunstock) on a turnout of 38%. Previously the party had operated under a collective leadership. She said the change &quot;was about having a face the country recognises – or hopefully comes to recognise. It was in recognition of the fact that people don&#x27;t really relate to abstract ideas, they relate more to the people who embody them.&quot; Lucas was elected as the Green Party&#x27;s first-ever MP (for Brighton Pavilion) at the general election of 2010.

In July 2010, Lucas expressed her support for seven campaigners of the Smash EDO campaign who had caused approximately £180,000 damage to the local EDO MBM arms factory and were acquitted of conspiring to cause criminal damage. The jury accepted their defence of lawful excuse – action undertaken to prevent a much worse crime – because the company manufactured and sold certain components used by the Israeli military, notably in its assault on Gaza. Lucas stated that: &quot;I am absolutely delighted the jury has recognised that the actions of the decommissioners were a legitimate response to the atrocities being committed in Gaza. I do not advocate non-violent direct action lightly... [but] their actions were driven by the responsibility to prevent further suffering in Gaza.&quot;

In 2011, she voted against the military intervention in Libya.

On 14 May 2012, Lucas announced she would be standing down as leader as of September 2012.

===Brighton Pavilion===

Brighton Pavilion had the highest vote in the 2005 general election for a Green Party candidate when Keith Taylor, a former Green Party Principal Speaker, gained 22% of the vote. In 2007, Lucas declared her intention to stand for the Green Party&#x27;s nomination for the prospective parliamentary candidate in the Brighton Pavilion constituency for the next general election. In a letter to party members, she indicated that she would only stand if she won the internal party selection election by more than 10%, to avoid internal division. On 18 July 2007, it was announced that Lucas had been selected by the Brighton Green Party. Lucas won with 55% of the party ballot against Keith Taylor&#x27;s 45%.

In May 2010, Lucas was elected as the first soley-Green MP to Westminster with a majority of 1,252 (Cynog Dafis sat as a &#x27;joint ticket&#x27; Plaid Cymru-Green MP from 1992 to 1997). She was also the first woman to be elected as an MP for Brighton. She delivered her maiden speech on 27 May 2010.

Lucas opposed the presentation of bare-breasted models on page 3 in &quot;The Sun&quot; and in 2013 was reprimanded for transgressing the Westminster dress code by wearing a T-shirt with the logo &quot;No More Page Three&quot; to protest against the feature during a Commons debate.

On 19 August 2013, Lucas was arrested at a non-violent protest against Cuadrilla Resources fracking operations in Sussex. She was subsequently charged with obstructing a public highway but was found not guilty on 17 April 2014 at Brighton Magistrates&#x27; Court. After the hearing, Lucas said: &quot;This judgement is right but this is not a victory or cause for celebration. We will continue to campaign to end fracking and only celebrate when our world is on the path to a clean energy future&quot;.

In the 2015 general election, Lucas was re-elected with a much increased majority of 7,967 and vote share. In the 2017 general election Lucas increased her majority to 14,689, elected on 52.3% of the vote. Her vote majority increased again in the 2019 election by 5% with 33,151 votes.

In accord with long-standing Green policy, Lucas voted in 2015 for holding the European Union Referendum, but campaigning to stay in the EU with major reform.

On 8 June 2023, Lucas announced she would not be standing at the 2024 general election. On 19 July 2023, it was announced that Siân Berry will be the Green candidate for Lucas&#x27; Brighton seat at the next election.

===Co-leader with Jonathan Bartley===
On 31 May 2016, it was announced that Lucas would run for the position of the Leader of the Green Party in a job share arrangement with the welfare spokesman Jonathan Bartley in the forthcoming 2016 Green Party leadership election.
On 2 September, it was announced that Lucas and Bartley had been elected with 86% of first-preference votes. Lucas said the party would strive to preserve the rights of EU nationals living in Britain, and EU rules on workers&#x27; rights and the environment, among other policies.

In May 2018, Lucas announced that at the end of her two-year term in September, she would not seek re-election as co-leader of the Green Party. In an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lucas wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s now time for me to show the power of letting go&quot;.

===Other roles and views===
Lucas is vice-president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and has been on the National Council of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament since 2004. She is also Vice Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Peak Oil and Gas. A former vice-president of the Stop the War Coalition, she resigned from the post in December 2015; she stated that her &quot;busy parliamentary and constituency schedule means that she doesn&#x27;t have time to fully engage with the role of a patron and, in light of some recent StWC positions that she didn&#x27;t support, she felt standing down was the responsible thing to do&quot;. 

Lucas is an advocate for reform of UK drug laws. She has called for the law to have an evidence-based approach to drugs that treats drug abuse as a health matter, rather than a criminal one.

In early 2013, Lucas co-signed a letter that was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and officially marked her support for the People&#x27;s Assembly Against Austerity movement. She also gave a speech at the People&#x27;s Assembly Conference, held at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013.

In August 2015, Lucas endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. She wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt so optimistic about a potential leader of the Labour Party. For the first time in my memory, the party of Keir Hardie and Clement Attlee looks likely to be led again by someone who dares to stand up for the radical changes demanded by the challenges we face.&quot;

Lucas is a supporter of a permanent universal basic income. In January 2016, Lucas tabled a motion in the British Parliament, calling on the Government to commission research into the effects of a universal basic income and examine its feasibility to replace the UK&#x27;s existing social security system.

In 2016, she criticized the government&#x27;s decision to move ahead with construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.

On 15 April 2018, she attended the launch event of the People&#x27;s Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

In August 2019, Lucas was subject to criticism for suggesting the creation of an all-female cabinet, who happened to be all white, as part of a national unity government, to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. Later that year, she criticised the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg for appearing to recline on a front bench asleep while she was delivering a speech.

In February 2020, she was investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, following a complaint by Michael Fabricant that she had offered a tour of the Commons in exchange for £150, as part of a fundraising drive. Lucas said she did not believe she had done anything wrong. An investigation found she had breached the House of Commons Code of Conduct in offering and giving the tour. The Standards Commissioner also found that it gave her an &quot;unfair advantage over other election candidates&quot;. Lucas acknowledged that she had breached the rules and promised not to repeat the breach; the Green Party returned the donation to the supporter who received the tour.

In 2021, Lucas was one of three MPs who successfully took legal action against the Department of Health and Social Care over contracts awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, Lucas criticized the HS2 high-speed project, saying it was a &quot;vanity project&quot; and that the construction of the high-speed rail project would emit more carbon than could be saved over decades.

Lucas supports ecocide being made a crime at the International Criminal Court.

====Writing====
Lucas is a prolific writer of reports, articles and books on the subjects of trade justice, localisation, globalisation, animal welfare, and food, in which she criticises of free trade, a single European currency, trade-led development policies, genetically modified food, and a lack of attention to environmental and social issues. Her most substantial work is &quot;Green Alternatives to Globalisation: A Manifesto&quot; (co-authored with Mike Woodin in 2004), which advocates localisation of economies based on minimal trade and greater social and environmental concern, in opposition to neo-liberal, market-led forces of globalisation. A book by Lucas on her time in parliament, &quot;Honourable Friends: Parliament and the Fight for Change&quot;, was published in 2015. In April 2024 via Hutchinson Heinemann, Lucas published a book titled &quot;Another England: How to Reclaim Our National Story&quot;.

==Awards==

In her time as a politician and activist, Lucas has won the 2006 Michael Kay Award &quot;for her outstanding contribution to European animal welfare&quot; from the RSPCA. In December 2024, Lucas and Chris Packham resigned from the RSPCA after accusing it of &quot;legitimising cruelty&quot;.

Lucas has won the award for Politician of the Year in &quot;The Observer&quot; Newspaper Ethical Awards three times. The award is voted for by &quot;Observer&quot; readers, who chose her to win in 2007, 2009 and 2010. In 2008, she was listed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of &quot;50 people who could save the planet&quot;.

In October 2008, Lucas was winner in the Trade category of &quot;The Parliament&quot; magazine MEP Awards 2008. The awards are voted for by MEPs and NGOs. In April 2010, Lucas won Best UK Politician in &quot;The Independent&quot; Green Awards and in November 2010, she was awarded &quot;Newcomer of the Year&quot; in &quot;The Spectator&quot; Parliamentarian of the Year awards. In July 2011, she was awarded &quot;Best all-rounder&quot; in the &quot;Total Politics&quot; End of Year MP awards and in September 2011, she was awarded &quot;MP of the Year&quot; in the Women in Public Life Awards 2011. Also in 2011 she was given the Political Studies Association award for &quot;Influencing the Political Agenda&quot; and voted &quot;Progressive of the Year&quot; in &quot;Left Foot Forward&#x27;s&quot; readers&#x27; poll.

In November 2020, she was included in the BBC Radio 4 Woman&#x27;s Hour Power list 2020.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Lucas married Richard Savage. The couple have two sons, one of whom is an academic at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Lucas is a vegetarian; she told &quot;ITV News&quot; political correspondent Paul Brand in September 2019 that she is &quot;moving as fast as she can towards being vegan&quot;.

== Films ==
In 2016, a short documentary film about Lucas, &quot;One Green Seat&quot;, directed by Daniel Ifans and produced by We Are Tilt, was an Official Selection at the 2017 &quot;Artemis Women In Action Film Festival&quot; in Santa Monica, California.

<doc id="415710" wikidata="Q4405632" url="?curid=415710" title="Graham Booth">
<text>Graham Harry Booth (29 March 1940 – 14 December 2011) was a British UK Independence Party (UKIP) politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South West England from 2002 to 2008.

Booth was born in Paignton, Devon and educated at Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School. Before he entered politics, he was a businessman in the building and tourism trades. In the 1999 European Parliament elections, Booth was the number two candidate on the UKIP list for South West England. Consequently, he became an MEP in 2002 as the replacement for Michael Holmes, former party leader, when Holmes resigned from the European Parliament. Booth was re-elected in 2004 with a greatly increased vote. In the 2005 General Election he contested the Torbay constituency in Devon, and gained 7.9% of the vote.

UKIP MEPs frequently claim that the European Parliament is a powerless talking shop, with real lawmaking power resting with the European Commission. However, Graham Booth is credited with having helped save the Isles of Scilly helicopter shuttle service in his constituency by means of an astute parliamentary speech in 2003. The service, which is crucial to life on the islands, had been threatened with closure by a heavy-handed interpretation of a new EU directive aimed at larger airlines. Following Booth&#x27;s speech, an alliance between UKIP and the UK Labour Party MEPs persuaded the EU Transport Commissioner to amend the directive, allowing the service (and similar &#x27;social carriers&#x27; across Europe) to continue in business.

Booth retired from his role as a UKIP MEP on 1 October 2008 and was replaced by the next candidate on the list, Trevor Colman. He continued to be a keen activist in and around the bay until his death in December 2011.

<text>A Simple Plan is a 1993 thriller novel by Scott Smith. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review said the book had &quot;emotional accuracy with an exceptionally skilled plot.&quot; A film adaptation, directed by Sam Raimi, was released in 1998; according to the &quot;Times&quot; review, the novel is so dark that the story was adjusted to soften the ending.

==Plot==

The story is set in a small town in northern Ohio that is snow-covered throughout the winter. The narrator is Hank Mitchell, an accountant and family man. He begins by stating that his parents had died in a car accident when their vehicle collided with a semi; Hank believes it was a suicide as his parents had been deep in debt due to over-borrowing and mismanagement. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Hank and his elder brother Jacob set out to visit their parents&#x27; graves, accompanied by Lou, Jacob&#x27;s only friend. When a fox runs in front of Jacob&#x27;s truck, he swerves and crashes into a ditch.

Jacob&#x27;s dog chases the fleeing fox into a nature preserve. The three men go after the dog and find a crashed plane; inside the plane is the dead pilot and a gym bag with $4.4 million in $100 bills. Hank wants to turn the money over to the authorities, but Jacob and Lou, both unemployed, want to keep it. Hank&#x27;s compromise is that he will hold onto the money until after the plane is discovered in the spring. If there is any mention of the missing money, he will burn it; otherwise, after six months, they will split it equally and separately leave town.

Hank&#x27;s wife, Sarah, accepts the idea, at first reluctantly, then enthusiastically. The following day, at Sarah&#x27;s suggestion, Hank and Jacob return to the plane and plant five hundred thousand dollars in the cockpit. A curious neighbor - Pederson - sees the tracks in the snow and Jacob, in a panic, hits and apparently kills the man. When Hank returns and sees that Pederson is still breathing, he suffocates him.

Having racked up gambling debts in anticipation of his share of the money, Lou tries to blackmail Hank for his third of the money ahead of schedule. At Sarah&#x27;s urging, Hank and Jacob con Lou into saying on tape that he killed the neighbor; in an ensuing scuffle, Lou and his girlfriend are both killed. Hank stages the deaths as a domestic dispute, murdering a man next door - the landlord Sonny - in the process. Jacob makes it clear that he is uncomfortable with the set-up, so Hank shoots and kills his brother. The police, the media, and the townspeople all accept Hank&#x27;s explanation of the carnage.

Later, Hank buys a condo at an auction, which turns out to be a scam. Having lost the majority of their savings, they need the airplane money more than ever. Soon afterward, Hank learns that the FBI is looking for a lost plane with $4.4 million in ransom money on board. When both the town sheriff and the remaining kidnapper are killed in the search for the plane, Sarah believes that they finally are home free. But Hank, called in for questioning, learns that the serial number of every tenth bill had been recorded, and there is no way to tell the marked bills from those that are not marked. If the money is spent, it can be traced. Sarah tells Hank that she has already spent one of the bills at a convenience store, and he goes there to steal it back. In a fight with the cashier, Hank kills the man with a machete. When an elderly woman demands to be let into the store, he kills her as well. Hank flees with the bill and is never suspected.

Hank goes home and burns the money over Sarah&#x27;s protests. In the epilogue, Sarah has a baby boy, whom they name Jacob. A few weeks after the birth, their daughter nearly drowns in a wading pool and suffers permanent brain damage. Hank and Sarah accept this as punishment for their crimes. Hank narrates that he pictures his brother Jacob from time to time, because only this memory makes him feel human.

==Critical reception==
In its 1993 review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; a &quot;beautifully controlled and disturbing first novel.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the book as &quot;a tragic journey as compelling, resolute and relentlessly grim as &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="415716" wikidata="Q740354" url="?curid=415716" title="Hosokawa Katsumoto">
<text>was one of the Kanrei, the deputies to the Shōgun, during Japan&#x27;s Muromachi period. He is famous for his involvement in the creation of Ryōan-ji, a temple famous for its rock garden, and for his involvement in the Ōnin War, which sparked the 130-year Sengoku period. His childhood name was Sumiakamaru (聡明丸).

His conflicts with his father-in-law, Yamana Sōzen, who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei, were among those that ignited the Ōnin War in 1467. When the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464, Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further, supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate. Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shōgun&#x27;s brother Ashikaga Yoshimi and supported his claim to the shogunate.

In 1467, open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto, between Hosokawa and Yamana, who each commanded roughly 80,000 men. The Shōgun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel, and so the two armies remained immobile for some time, but within a few months, the tensions had risen too far, and war simply could not be delayed any further. Hosokawa made the first obvious attack within the capital, attacking the mansion of a Yamana general by the name of Isshiki. Fighting erupted between the two camps, and over the course of the next few days, many were killed, and many buildings destroyed, either by the soldiers or by looters. Each army gradually carved out a section of the city that they held and defended against the other; Hosokawa&#x27;s army came to be known as the Eastern Army, as Yamana&#x27;s so-called &quot;Western Army&quot; controlled western sections of Kyoto. But not all the fighting took place within the city; Hosokawa sent men onto the main roads, and into Yamana&#x27;s home provinces, to prevent his reinforcements from reaching the main battles.

Though Hosokawa attacked first, he convinced the Shōgun to brand Yamana, not himself, with the stigma of being a rebel against the Shogunate. He even persuaded Yoshimasa to make him the general of the official Shogunal attacks on Yamana but failed to grant him any tangible support. Some of Yamana&#x27;s followers deserted, joining Hosokawa&#x27;s morally superior side, but many more switched sides as a result of the work of Hosokawa&#x27;s emissaries to the provinces where Yamana and his allies drew their armies.

By New Year&#x27;s of 1468, nearly a year after the war began, the fighting tapered off. For much of that year, the two forces engaged in glaring contests and limited sorties, both desiring to rebuild and to act only defensively. Both spent the next several years in political, not military, conflict, and in 1469, the Shōgun named his son Yoshihisa, his heir. But Hosokawa was weary of battle and wished for peace. However, by 1473, both Hosokawa and Yamana were dead.
