<text>The Brill Building is an office building at 1619 Broadway on 49th Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan, just north of Times Square and farther uptown from the historic musical Tin Pan Alley neighborhood. The Brill Building housed music industry offices and studios where some of the most popular American songs were written. It is considered to have been the center of the American music industry that dominated the pop charts in the early 1960s. 

It was built in 1931 as the Alan E. Lefcourt Building, after the son of its builder Abraham E. Lefcourt, and designed by Victor Bark Jr. The building is 11 stories high and has about of rentable area.

The &quot;Brill&quot; name comes from Maurice Brill, a haberdasher who operated a store at street level and subsequently bought the building. The Brill Building was purchased by 1619 Broadway Realty LLC in June 2013 and subsequently renovated. A CVS Pharmacy opened on the building&#x27;s first two floors in 2019.

==Big band era==
Before World War II, the Brill Building became a center of activity for the popular music industry, especially music publishing and songwriting. Scores of music publishers had offices in the Brill Building. Once songs had been published, the publishers sent song pluggers to the popular bands and radio stations. These song pluggers would sing and/or play the song for the band leaders to encourage bands to play their music.

During the ASCAP strike of 1941, many of the composers, authors and publishers turned to pseudonyms in order to have their songs played on the air.

Brill Building songs were frequently at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hit Parade and played by the leading bands of the day:
* The Benny Goodman Orchestra
* The Glenn Miller Orchestra
* The Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra
* The Tommy Dorsey Orchestra

Publishers included:
* Leo Feist Inc.
* Lewis Music Publishing
* Mills Music Publishing

Brill Building composers and lyricists during the big band era included:

* Buddy Feyne
* Johnny Mercer
* Irving Mills
* Ben Raleigh
* Billy Rose

== &quot;Brill Building Sound&quot;==

The Brill Building&#x27;s name has been widely adopted as a shorthand term for a broad and influential stream of American popular music (strongly influenced by Latin music, Traditional black gospel, and rhythm and blues) which enjoyed great commercial success in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s. Many significant American and international publishing companies, music agencies, and record labels were based in New York, and although these ventures were naturally spread across many locations, the Brill Building was regarded as probably the most prestigious address in New York for music business professionals. The term &quot;Brill Building Sound&quot; is somewhat inaccurate, however, since much of the music so categorized actually emanated from other locations — music historian Ken Emerson nominated buildings at 1650 Broadway and 1697 Broadway as other significant bases of activity in this field.

By 1962, the Brill Building contained 165 music businesses. In the mid-1960s a musician could cut a demo, find a publisher and printer, promote the record and cut a deal with radio promoters without leaving the building. The creative culture of the independent music companies in the Brill Building and the nearby 1650 Broadway came to define the influential &quot;Brill Building Sound&quot; and the style of popular songwriting and recording created by its writers and producers.

Carole King described the atmosphere at the &quot;Brill Building&quot; publishing houses of the period:

The Brill Building approach—which can be extended to other publishers not based in the Brill Building—was one way that professionals in the music business took control of things in the time after rock and roll&#x27;s first wave. In the Brill Building practice, there were no more unpredictable or rebellious singers; in fact, a specific singer in most cases could be easily replaced with another. These songs were written to order by pros who could custom fit the music and lyrics to the targeted teen audience. In a number of important ways, the Brill Building approach was a return to the way business had been done in the years before rock and roll, since it returned power to the publishers and record labels and made the performing artists themselves much less central to the music&#x27;s production.

=== Writers ===
Many of the best works in this diverse category were written by a loosely affiliated group of songwriter-producer teams—mostly duos—that enjoyed immense success and who collectively wrote some of the biggest hits of the period. Many in this group were close friends and/or (in the cases of Goffin-King, Mann-Weil and Greenwich-Barry) married couples, as well as creative and business associates—and both individually and as duos, they often worked together and with other writers in a wide variety of combinations. Some (Carole King, Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond, Boyce and Hart, Bob Gaudio by way of The Four Seasons) recorded and had hits with their own music.

=== Aldon Music (1650 Broadway) ===

Many of these writers came to prominence while under contract to Aldon Music, a publishing company founded in 1958 by industry veteran Al Nevins, and aspiring music entrepreneur Don Kirshner. Aldon was not initially located in the Brill Building, but rather, a block away at 1650 Broadway (at 51st Street). A number of Brill Building writers worked at 1650 Broadway, and the building continued to house record labels throughout the decades.

== In popular culture ==

The 1996 film &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot; is in part a fictionalized account of the life in the Brill Building. Illeana Douglas plays a songwriter loosely based on Carole King. Similarly, Broadway musical &quot;&quot; depicts King&#x27;s early career, including her songwriting at 1650 Broadway. Scenes from &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; depict the Brill Building and the Allegro Studios at 1650 Broadway.

In &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, J.J. Hunsecker and his sister Susie live on one of the upper floors of the Brill Building. The title of the 2014 New Pornographers power pop album &quot;Brill Bruisers&quot; is a reference to the 1960s-era Brill Building studio sound. In the HBO series &quot;Vinyl,&quot; the fictitious record label American Century is headquartered in the Brill Building.

Jack Dempsey&#x27;s Broadway Restaurant was located in the Brill Building&#x27;s first floor on Broadway.

It features in several episodes of the Broadway themed NBC musical drama &quot;Smash&quot;.

Stephin Merritt makes reference to the Brill Building on the Magnetic Fields&#x27; &quot;Epitaph For My Heart&quot; from their 1999 release &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;.

==Renovations and current use==
The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Brill Building as a landmark in December 2010.

In 2017 Brookfield Properties foreclosed on the building&#x27;s $50 million mezzanine loan. It subsequently bought the building for $220 million at a foreclosure auction in March 2017. Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s hospitality company considered the building for a Margaritaville restaurant. It had investigated taking across the ground floor, second floor, and 11-story roof. The owners also negotiated with CVS Pharmacy and WeWork to lease some of the space, In 2020, the LPC approved a proposal by Bruno Kearney Architects to add LED signs to the Brill Building&#x27;s facade and modify a ground-floor storefront for TD Bank. In July 2023, Brookfield transferred the deed to the Brill Building to lender Mack Real Estate Group in a transfer valued at $216.1 million. At the time, part of the ground floor was occupied by CVS and TD Bank, while some of the storefronts were vacant.

<text>The Treaty of Rapallo was an agreement between the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of the First World War. It was intended to settle the Adriatic question, which referred to Italian claims over territories promised to the country in return for its entry into the war against Austria-Hungary, claims that were made on the basis of the 1915 Treaty of London. The wartime pact promised Italy large areas of the eastern Adriatic. The treaty, signed on 12 November 1920 in Rapallo, Italy, generally redeemed the promises of territorial gains in the former Austrian Littoral by awarding Italy territories generally corresponding to the peninsula of Istria and the former Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, with the addition of the Snežnik Plateau, in addition to what was promised by the London treaty. The articles regarding Dalmatia were largely ignored. Instead, in Dalmatia, Italy received the city of Zadar and several islands. Other provisions of the treaty contained safeguards for the rights of Italian nationals remaining in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and provisions for commissions to demarcate the new border, and facilitate economic and educational cooperation. The treaty also established the Free State of Fiume, the city-state consisting of the former Austro-Hungarian &quot;Corpus separatum&quot; that consisted of Rijeka and a strip of coast giving the new state a land border with Italy at Istria.

The treaty was met with a degree of popular disapproval in both countries. In the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes it was unpopular with Slovenes and Croats, as it represented a loss of national territory where about a half million Slovenes and Croats lived. Zadar lost significance when it became an Italian semi-enclave, which allowed Split to overtake it in significance in Dalmatia. The Port of Rijeka suffered from the loss of trade with the hinterland, causing an economic decline. In Italy, the claim to Dalmatia relinquished in the Treaty of Rapallo contributed to fueling the myth of the mutilated victory. The myth was created during the Paris Peace Conference, where the Italian delegation was unable to enforce the Treaty of London, and perpetuated the view that Italy had won the war but its victory was compromised by an unjust peace.

The Treaty of Rapallo was also condemned by the Italian general Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio, who previously had seized Rijeka with his troops, establishing there a state known as the Italian Regency of Carnaro. He resisted efforts to remove him from the city until the Italian Navy drove him out in the clash known as Bloody Christmas, so that the Free State of Fiume could be established. The city-state was abolished when Italy annexed the city four years later under the Treaty of Rome.

==Background==

===Treaty of London===

In 1915, the Kingdom of Italy entered World War I on the side of the Entente, following the signing of the Treaty of London, which promised Italy territorial gains at the expense of Austria-Hungary. The treaty was opposed by representatives of the South Slavs living in Austria-Hungary, who were organised as the Yugoslav Committee.

Following the 3 November 1918 Armistice of Villa Giusti, the Austro-Hungarian surrender, Italian troops moved to occupy parts of the eastern Adriatic shore promised to Italy under the Treaty of London, ahead of the Paris Peace Conference. The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, carved from areas of Austria-Hungary populated by the South Slavs, authorised the Yugoslav Committee to represent it abroad, and the short-lived state, shortly before it sought union with the Kingdom of Serbia to establish the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, laid a competing claim to the eastern Adriatic to counter the Italian demands. This claim was supported by deployment of the Royal Serbian Army to the area. The United States Navy also deployed an occupying force to the coast.

===Occupation of the eastern Adriatic===
The Entente powers arranged zones-of-occupation of the eastern Adriatic shores as follows: the United Kingdom was to control the Kvarner Gulf, while the northern parts of Dalmatia were the Italian zone. The southern Dalmatian coast was to be occupied by the United States, while the shores of the Kingdom of Montenegro and the Principality of Albania, further to the south, were the responsibility of the French. The occupation forces were to be coordinated by the Naval Committee for the Adriatic, which consisted of admirals delegated by the four powers. The committee initially met in the city of Rijeka (), but it subsequently moved to Venice and Rome. The occupation plan was never fully enforced, as only Italy deployed a large force to the area. The local Croatian population often expressed dissatisfaction with the Italian military presence, and several minor clashes occurred in 1919. There were frequent cases of deportations of the non-Italian population by the Italian forces.

By the end of 1918, the Italian troops occupied Istria and Rijeka, as well as a part of the Dalmatian coast extending between, and including, the cities of Zadar and Šibenik, with the hinterland extending to Knin and Drniš. Additionally, they captured the islands of Hvar, Vis, Korčula, Mljet, Lastovo, and Pag. The US presence was largely confined to Split, while the Serbian army controlled the rest of the coast. In 1919, a group of Italian veterans led by Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio seized Rijeka, establishing a short-lived state there known as the Italian Regency of Carnaro.

===Paris Peace Conference===
The problem of establishing the border between Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes—known as the Adriatic question—and the future status of Rijeka became major points of dispute at the Paris Peace Conference. Since 1917, Italy used the issue of the annexation of Montenegro by Serbia, or the unification of the countries, known as the Montenegrin question, to pressure Serbia into making concessions regarding Italian demands. Similarly, in 1920 and 1921, negotiations were conducted and agreements made—between the Croatian Committee of émigrés opposing establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s representatives—offering territory to Italy in exchange for support for the Croatian Committee&#x27;s work.

While the Italian representatives at the peace conference were demanding enforcement of the Treaty of London and the additional award of Rijeka, Woodrow Wilson opposed their demands and put forward his Fourteen Points, which favoured a solution that relied on local self-determination, arguing that the Treaty of London was invalid. Instead, Wilson proposed a division of the Istrian peninsula along the Wilson Line that largely corresponded to the ethnic makeup of the population, and a free-city status for Rijeka based on the city&#x27;s legal position of a &quot;Corpus separatum&quot; within Austria-Hungary. The British and French did not support enforcement of the treaty, as they thought Italy deserved relatively little due to its neutrality early in the war. Specifically, they were dismissive of Italian claims in Dalmatia. The British prime minister David Lloyd George only supported a free-city status for Zadar and Šibenik, while the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau only supported such a status for Zadar.

By late 1919, representatives of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, led by former Prime Minister Nikola Pašić and foreign minister Ante Trumbić, could not agree with Italian diplomats on the border question. In response, they were instructed to settle the issue through direct negotiations after the Paris Peace Conference. A particular obstacle to any agreement was D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s occupation of Rijeka, which caused the Italian government to reject a draft agreement submitted by the UK, the US, and France. Pašić&#x27;s and Trumbić&#x27;s refusal to agree to the plan provoked the French and British to threaten that the Treaty of London would be enforced unless they supported the allied proposal. In turn, Wilson blocked the Franco-British move by threatening to stop ratification of the Treaty of Versailles by the US.

==Rapallo Conference==
===Negotiations===
From spring 1920, the United Kingdom and France applied pressure on the prime minister of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Milenko Radomar Vesnić, and foreign minister Trumbić to resolve the Adriatic question, claiming that it represented a threat to peace in Europe. At the same time, the Italian foreign minister, Carlo Sforza, indicated he was ready to trade Italian claims in Dalmatia for British and French backing of Italian territorial demands further north in Istria. In September 1920, Sforza told the President of France, Alexandre Millerand, that he only wanted to enforce the Treaty of London regarding Istria and that he wanted none of Dalmatia except the city of Zadar. Following the 1920 presidential election, US support for Wilson&#x27;s ideas appeared to have ended, compelling Vesnić and Trumbić into bilateral negotiations with Sforza. Moreover, Prince Regent Alexander I, of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, wanted an agreement with Italy at any cost, wanting to achieve political stability in the country. According to Sforza, Vesnić later told him he was advised not to resist Italian demands for fear that Italy might impose a solution unilaterally.

A delegation from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was dispatched to Santa Margherita Ligure, in Italy, for bilateral negotiations. It was led by Vesnić, but the designated chief negotiatior was Trumbić. According to Svetozar Pribićević, this arrangement was made in Belgrade, in order to avoid the appearance that the Serbs were ceding to Italy territories inhabited by Croats and Slovenes. Therefore, Trumbić, as a Croat, would negotiate the treaty involving inevitable territorial concessions to Italy. Sforza&#x27;s most recent proposal was supported by the British and French, while the US remained silent on the matter, leaving Belgrade isolated. In addition to Prime Minister Vesnić and Foreign Minister Trumbić, the ambassador of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to Rome was also among the principal members of that delegation. The principal members of the Italian negotiating team included Sforza, as well as Minister of War Ivanoe Bonomi and Giuseppe Volpi. Other members of the delegation included Marcello Roddolo, Francesco Salata, , and General Pietro Badoglio. During the negotiations, Sforza demanded Istria and the Snežnik (), claiming their symbolic significance to Italy and stating that they would not be relinquished by the Italian army in any case. In return, he offered Italian friendship. Negotiations took place between 9–11 November 1920, resulting in the treaty being signed on 12 November, in the Villa Spinola. The treaty is named after the &quot;comune&quot; of Rapallo where the villa is located. Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti came from Rome for the signing.

===Terms===
Article 1 of the treaty dealt with national borders in the northern Adriatic basin, giving Italy Istria and the territory to the north of the peninsula, demarcated by a line indicated by reference to prominent peaks in the area, running from the area of Tarvisio via Triglav to the east of Idrija and Postojna, to Snežnik, and then to the Kvarner Gulf just to the west of Rijeka. Thus, the major cities of Trieste, Pula, and Gorizia were acquired by Italy. Article 2 gave to Italy the city of Zadar (as the Province of Zara), in northern Dalmatia, and defined the semi-enclave&#x27;s land boundaries by reference to surrounding peaks, villages, and tax-commune territories. Article 3 gave to Italy the islands of Cres, Lošinj, Lastovo, and Palagruža (referred to as Cherso, Lussin, Lagosta, and Pelagosta) with surrounding islets.

Article 4 of the treaty established the independent Free State of Fiume, defining its boundaries as those of the former Austro-Hungarian &quot;Corpus separatum&quot;, with the addition of a strip of land connecting it to the Italian territory in Istria between the Kvarner Gulf and the town of Kastav. This arrangement left the suburb of Sušak to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes since it was situated across the Rječina River, just outside the &quot;Corpus separatum&quot;. Article 5 determined that the marking of the border on the ground would be carried out by a bilateral commission and that any disputes would be referred to the President of the Swiss Confederation. Article 6 required the parties to the treaty to convene, within two months, a conference of experts to draw up proposals for economic and financial cooperation between the parties to the treaty.

Article 7 of the treaty determined that Italian entities established in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as well as Italians residing in that country, would retain all existing economic authorisations issued to them by the Kingdom or any of its predecessor-state governments. The same article allowed ethnic Italians to opt for Italian citizenship within a year. Those choosing Italian citizenship were guaranteed the right to remain residents of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, property rights, and freedom of religion. Finally, the same article provided that the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes would recognise any academic degrees obtained by Italian citizens as if they were obtained from institutions in that country. Article 8 called for enhanced educational cooperation between the parties to the treaty. Article 9 stated that the treaty was drawn up in Italian and Serbo-Croatian, but provided that the Italian version would be definitive in cases of dispute. The treaty was signed by Giolitti, Sforza, and Bonomi on behalf of Italy, and by Vesnić, Trumbić, and finance minister on behalf of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

==Aftermath==
A significant portion of the Treaty of Rapallo consisted of provisions regulating the status of Italians in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but their number was low, estimated to be several hundred. On the other hand, the addition of the new Italian territory meant the addition of about a half a million South Slavs (mostly Slovenes and Croats) to the country&#x27;s population. Even though the extent of the Italian territorial expansion was reduced in comparison to that promised by the Treaty of London, the Italian military was satisfied with the defensible land border and the naval facilities in Pula. It thought of Dalmatia as problematic to defend and primarily wanted to deny it to the Russian Empire, but the Russian threat was no longer a realistic prospect since the 1917 October Revolution. Politically, an agreement similar to the Treaty of Rapallo was likely possible at the Paris Peace Conference. However, the inability of the Italian delegation at that conference to enforce the Treaty of London, and annex Rijeka, fueled the nationalistic myth of the mutilated victory. Following the Treaty of Rapallo, the myth persisted and the perception of political failure weakened liberal politicians.

On 6 December 1920, less than a month after resigning from the post of foreign minister, Trumbić gave a speech in Split where he remarked that grief over the loss of national territory was expected, adding that it was an inevitable outcome of the peace conference and the subsequent bilateral negotiations, though most of the Italian territorial gains were reversed in the aftermath of World War II. Nonetheless, Croats and Slovenes complained that their interests were sacrificed by Serbs. The Treaty of Rapallo (along with the death of Nicholas I of Montenegro a few months later) marked the end of Italian support for Montenegrin resistance against the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. According to historian Srđa Pavlović, the signing of the treaty and the conclusion of the 1920 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes Constitutional Assembly election prompted the Entente powers to break off relations with the Montenegrin government-in-exile. Likewise, all Italian support for the Croatian Committee ended after the treaty was concluded. D&#x27;Annunzio condemned the treaty in a declaration of 17 November. The Italian Regency of Carnaro proclaimed a state of war four days later. The Italian Navy drove D&#x27;Annunzio from Rijeka in an intervention known as Bloody Christmas. The town became the city-state envisaged by the Treaty of Rapallo. Nonetheless, the Free State of Fiume was short-lived, and Italy annexed it under the 1924 Treaty of Rome. The loss of the hinterland served by the Port of Rijeka led to the decline of importance of both the port and the city, despite the introduction of free economic zone privileges. The same privileges were granted to Zadar, but its status of a semi-enclave limited its development too. Its population grew between 1921 and 1936 from 15,800 to 20,000, but a quarter of the residents were military personnel. At the same time, other cities in Dalmatia enjoyed much faster growth. This was especially true of Split, which became the regional capital instead of Zadar.

<doc id="420676" wikidata="Q3555987" url="?curid=420676" title="Education in Greece">
<text>Education in Greece is centralized and governed by the Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs, and Sports (Greek: ) at all grade levels in elementary, middle school, and high school. The Ministry exercises control over public schools, formulates and implements legislation, administers the budget, coordinates national level university entrance examinations, sets up the national curriculum, appoints public school teaching staff, and coordinates other services.

The Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs is also in charge of which classes are necessary for general education. They have implemented mandatory courses such as religion in required grade levels (1st-9th grades). Students can only be exempt if their guardians fill out a declaration excluding them from religious lessons. 

The national supervisory role of the Ministry is exercised through Regional Unit Public Education Offices, which are named Regional Directorates of Primary and Secondary School Education. Public schools and their supply of textbooks are funded by the government. Public schools in Greece are tuition-free and students on a state approved list are provided textbooks at no cost.

About 25% of postgraduate programmes are tuition-fee, while about 30% of students are eligible to attend programmes tuition-free based on individual criteria. 

Formal education in Greece comprises three educational stages. The first stage of formal education is the primary stage, which lasts for six years starting aged six and ending at the age of 12, followed by the secondary stage, which is separated into two sub-stages: the compulsory middle school, which lasts three years starting at age 12, and non-compulsory Lyceum, which lasts three years starting at 15. The third stage involves higher education.

School holidays in Greece include Christmas, Greek Independence Day, Easter, National Anniversary Day, a three-month summer holiday, National Public Holidays, and local holidays, which vary by region such as the local patron saint&#x27;s day.

In addition to schooling, the majority of students attend extracurricular private classes at private tutoring centres called &quot;frontistiria&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;frontistirio&quot;), or one-to-one tuition. These centres prepare students for higher education admissions, like the Pan-Hellenic Examinations, and/or provide foreign language education.

It is forbidden by law for students to use mobile phones while on the school premises. Taking or making phone calls, texting, or the use of other camera, video or other recording devices or medium that have image and audio processing ability like smartwatches is forbidden. Students must switch off their mobile phones or set them to silent mode and keep them in their bags while on the school premises. However, especially at high schools, the use of mobile phones is widespread, especially at breaks and sometimes in the class.

==Preschool==
Most preschools, also known as pre-primary, are attached to and share buildings with a primary school. Preschool is compulsory and lasts 2 years, split into 1 year of Pre-kindergarten (&quot;Προνηπιαγωγείο&quot;) and 1 year of Kindergarten (&quot;Νηπιαγωγείο&quot;; &quot;Nipiagogeio&quot;). Since the school year 2018–2019, children who would be four years of age by December 31 are required to begin attending preschool on September 11 of the same year. Applications for registration and enrolment are usually carried out annually during fifteen consecutive days in May. After this period expires, students are neither allowed to register nor enroll.
* 1st Year / Pre-Kindergarten (&quot;), age 4 to 5 years old (with some 3-year-olds, about to turn 4, attending) 
* 2nd Year / Kindergarten (&quot;), age 5 to 6 (with some 4-year-olds, about to turn 5, attending)

There are also the public Special Preschools and public Experimental Preschools (&quot;&quot;)

In these school years, students are given descriptive assessments instead of number/letter grades. 

=== Foreign Language ===
Students begin taking English as part of their core curriculum in kindergarten. It has been scientifically proven that until the age of 11 it is more likely to successfully become proficient in a foreign language than any older age. This may be the reason many countries in the European Union begin learning a foreign language, specifically English, at the age of 5. 

==Primary education==
Primary school (, &quot;Dimotiko scholeio&quot;) is compulsory for 6 years. There is also the public Special Primary and public Experimental Primary ().

The school year starts on September 11 and ends on June 15. The standard school day starts at 08:15 and finishes at 13:15. It comprises six academic years of schooling named τάξεις (grades), numbered 1 through to 6. Enrollment to the next tier of compulsory education, the Gymnasium, is automatic. The classes for a subject vary with the teacher who teaches. Students are awarded an &quot;&quot; (&quot;Apolytirio Dimotikou&quot;, primary school leaving certificate) which gives automatic admission to the lower secondary education (gymnasium).

In Year 1 and Year 2, students are not officially graded. Beginning with years 3 and 4, grades are ranked alphabetically from A to D. From year 5, when written exams are introduced, to year 6 it changes to numbers, going from 4, the lowest, to 10 the highest (best). 

Αges are typical and can vary with the most common ages approximately: 
; Grades of Primary School
Grade 1–6 
* 1st Year / First grade (&quot;), age 6 to 7-year-olds
* 2nd Year / Second grade (&quot;), age 7 to 8
* 3rd Year / Third grade (&quot;), age 8 to 9
* 4th Year / Fourth grade (&quot;), age 9 to 10
* 5th Year / Fifth grade (&quot;), age 10 to 11
* 6th Year / Sixth grade (&quot;), age 11 to 12 

; Grading System 

* 1st Year: no grade points
* 2nd Year: no grade points 
* 3rd Year: Α–Γ (A–C)
* 4th Year: Α–Γ (A–C)
* 5th Year: 1–10
* 6th Year: 1–10

==Secondary education==


===Lower Secondary Education===

==Criticism and controversies==
* Corruption in Greece in the public sector was believed to hold the first place in of all EU countries, Greece being the most corrupt country in the European Union, a survey revealed in 2012. The Greek public schools lack a human resource development, having huge corruption at all education levels according to the Global Corruption Barometer. According to the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency International, Greece is the 59th least corrupt country out of the 180 countries worldwide, scored 50% corruption out of 100%, of the perceived level of public level corruption on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (clear). 
* Accounts of reports of the Greece National Transparency Authority (EAD; formerly Inspectors-Controllers Body for Public Administration; SEEDD) show criminal offences, complaints, lawsuits and criminal prosecutions against public school educators and directors who were found to commit violations; using profane, obscene, or ethnically offensive language; organized crime activities; fraud; personal data theft; use of handphone and other unauthorised electronic and mobile devices during curriculum time; sexual abuse assault from students and educators; corruption; forgery; extortion; illegal fees; embezzlement of school funds; bullying.
* Greece was controversial for its legal disciplinary measure of school corporal punishment because was widely used and allowed in public schools, performed by school educators under the Principal&#x27;s express authority, until it was banned in 1998 at primary schools and in 2005 at secondary schools. The physical punishment took place in front of all students consisted in the form of caning the buttocks of a student with a paddle or strap, caning on the palm of the hand with a wood stick, hitting a student&#x27;s face, expulsion set in the school outdoor courtyard in the cold winter.
* The former government agency of ΟΕΕΚ (; English: Organization for Vocational Education and Training; which replaced by ; English: National Organization for the Certification of Qualifications and Vocational Guidance; EOPPEP) had embezzled €6,000,000 of European Commission funds. Since 30 July 2010, an official investigation on the criminal conspiracy theft began from the EU Council of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European Convention on Human Rights. 
* One out of the three public school students in Greece have received physical violation and abuse include verbal at 56.5 percent, followed by physical abuse at a rate of 30.5 percent and the threat of social exclusion at 27.8 percent. Greece ranks 4th place of student bullying amongst Europe countries according to the 1st European Anti-Bullying Network Conference, &quot;Bullying and Cyberbullying Across Europe&quot;, Conference Proceedings, Athens, 2015 EAN (). 
* Offences and corruption committed by highly rank or wealth persons holding public education school positions are rarely properly and transparently prosecuted.
* The tuition fee requirement from the most Greek Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) postgraduate programmes is contrary and entirely violating the Constitution of Greece, that all Greek citizens (and certain foreigners who live and work in the country) are entitled to free education on all levels at state educational institutions. The same violation act was done from the founding (law 2009/1992) of the Institutes of Vocational Training (IEKs) where all public IEK students were required to pay up to €367 statute fee for every semester up until the 2012–2013 academic year, that has been repealed since 2013–2014 academic year (article 22, law 4186/2013). 
* Statistically, at public education schools and public universities, mostly at vocational lyceums, are taking place accidents, illegal and criminal acts, violation incidents against, and from, students, although at private schools have occurred too.

<doc id="420691" wikidata="Q7771379" url="?curid=420691" title="The Underground History of American Education">
<text>The Underground History of American Education: A Schoolteacher’s Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling (, pbk. ) is a critique of the United States education system by John Taylor Gatto.

A former teacher, Gatto left the classroom the same year he was named New York State Teacher of the Year. He announced his decision in a letter titled &quot;I Quit, I Think&quot;.

Using anecdotes gathered from thirty years of teaching, alongside documentation, Gatto presents his view of &quot;modern compulsion schooling&quot; as opposed to genuine education, describing a &quot;conflict between systems which offer physical safety and certainty at the cost of suppressing free will, and those which offer liberty at the price of constant risk&quot;. Gatto argues that educational strategies promoted by government and industry leaders for over a century included the creation of a system that keeps real power in the hands of very few people.

From the book&#x27;s Introduction:
:&quot;... Underground History isn’t a history proper, but a collection of materials toward a history, embedded in a personal essay analyzing why mass compulsion schooling is unreformable. The history I have unearthed is important to our understanding; it’s a good start, I believe, but much remains undone.&quot;

:&quot;... what I’m trying to describe [is] that what has happened to our schools was inherent in the original design for a planned economy and a planned society laid down so proudly at the end of the nineteenth century.&quot;

The book was read from 2006-2007 for the Unwelcome Guests radio show.

==Editions==
Oxford Scholars Press released a revised edition of the book in 2017, featuring a foreword is by U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, an introduction by David Ruenzel, and an afterword by Richard Grove of Tragedy &amp; Hope media. The edition was edited by David James Rodriguez.

==Reception==
Layla Abdel Rahim included the book on her reading list regarding education and pedagogy. She described the book as, &quot;an extremely important critique of culture and pedagogy.&quot;

==Reception==
Michael and Henry Medved included &quot;Brigham Young&quot; in their 1984 book describing film financial failures, &quot;The Hollywood Hall of Shame&quot;, stating &quot;Twentieth Century-Fox tried to emphasize its star power and to downplay the religious elements (eventually re-titling it &quot;Brigham Young, Frontiersman&quot;), but the picture still failed, even in Utah.&quot;

<text>The Liberal Party of South Africa was a South African political party from 1953 to 1968.

==Founding ==

The party was founded on 9 May 1953 at a meeting of the South African Liberal Association in Cape Town. Essentially, it grew out of a belief that the United Party was unable to achieve any real liberal progress in South Africa. Its establishment occurred during the &quot;Coloured Vote&quot; Constitutional Crisis of the 1950s, and the division of the Torch Commando on the matter of mixed membership.

Founding members of the party included (original positions in the party given):
*Margaret Ballinger (South African MP) – President of party
*Alan Paton (novelist) – Vice-President
*Leo Marquard – Vice President
*Dr. Oscar Wolheim – Chairman
*Leslie Rubin (South African Senator) – Vice-Chairman
*Peter Brown – National Chairman
*Violaine Junod
*Hilda Kuper
*Leo Kuper
*H. Selby Msimang
*Deneys Schreiner

==History==
For the first half of its life, the Liberal Party was comparatively conservative and saw its task primarily in terms of changing the minds of the white electorate. It leaned towards a qualified franchise.

This changed in 1959–1960. The Progressive Party, formed from a number of disgruntled United Party MPs in 1959, emerged on the political ground the Liberal Party had occupied up until then. In 1960, the Sharpeville massacre and consequent State of Emergency, during which black organisations were banned and several Liberal Party members were detained, changed the outlook of the party. Another factor was the use of simultaneous translation equipment at party congresses, which enabled black rural members to speak uninhibitedly for the first time. The party reached a peak of four MPs in the South African House of Assembly, all of them from the &quot;Native&quot; representatives, elected under the Cape Qualified Franchise. 

In 1960, after the passing of the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, the Native representative MPs were abolished, and so the Liberal Party was left without parliamentary representation. The Progressive Party, following the split, had seven but lost all but one in the 1961 general election. The Progressive Party hence came to emerged as the more &quot;relevant&quot; political arm against apartheid, although its programme was more modest, favouring a qualified (but strictly non-racial) franchise akin to the old Cape franchise, indeed similar to that enacted in Rhodesia in 1961. 

In the 1960s, therefore, the Liberal Party had evolved into the party unequivocally for a democratic nonracial South Africa, with &quot;one man, one vote&quot; as its franchise policy. 

The Liberal Party, despite its opposition to the bantustan system of limited black self-government, also supported liberal candidates in the Transkei elections, and helped its rural members and others, especially in Natal, to resist the ethnic cleansing brought about by the forced removal of black South Africans to bantustans and, to a lesser degree, white South Africans from them. This opposition resulted in the banning of several party members and leaders. Among the black representatives of the Liberal Party Eddie Daniels, a political activist, spent fifteen years on Robben Island concurrent to Nelson Mandela&#x27;s serving his life sentence there.

==Contact==
The newspaper &quot;Contact&quot; was closely tied to the Liberal Party, although officially it was a separate publication. The link is described by Callan as follows:

It may, however, be more accurate to tie the paper to Patrick Duncan than the Liberal Party.

==End ==

The party was in direct conflict with the South African government from the outset. This was due largely to the party&#x27;s opposition to apartheid and criticism of the erosion of human rights by laws allowing detention without trial and arbitrary suppression of political opposition. Many of its members were placed under bans and persecuted by the South African government, which accused the party of furthering the aims of Communism.

In 1968, the South African government passed the so-called Prohibition of Improper Interference Act, which banned parties from having a multiracial membership. The Liberal Party was therefore forced to choose between disbanding or going underground, and in that same year, chose to disband. The final meeting was held in The Guildhall, Durban.

<text>Robert Wilson Simmons (March 29, 1919 – September 26, 1954) was an American surfer and surfboard shaper, considered to be the father of the modern surfboard.

Simmons was born in Los Angeles, California. During his early teens, he developed a tumor on his left ankle which nearly caused his leg to be amputated. After beating the cancer, Bob was involved in a serious motorcycle collision. He studied mathematics at the California Institute of Technology but dropped out. 

While staying in the hospital he was advised to try surfing. He first rode a surfboard at age 20 at Newport Beach, California. Simmons was also famous for being one of the first to incorporate fiberglass and polyester resin to create a lightweight, durable surfboard.

In 1954, Simmons drowned while surfing at Windansea Beach in San Diego, California.

<text>Matthew Edward Gonzalez (born June 4, 1965) is an American politician, lawyer, and activist. He served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 2001 to 2005 and was president of the Board. In 2003, Gonzalez, running as a member of the Green Party, lost a race for mayor of San Francisco to Democrat Gavin Newsom. In the 2008 presidential election, Gonzalez ran for vice president as the running mate of candidate Ralph Nader. , he works as the Chief Attorney at the San Francisco Public Defender&#x27;s Office.

==Early life and education==
Matthew Edward Gonzalez was born in McAllen, Texas. His father, a division chief for the international tobacco company Brown &amp; Williamson, moved the family to New Orleans, Baltimore, and Louisville, Kentucky, before resettling in McAllen when Gonzalez was eleven years old. After graduating from McAllen Memorial High School, he attended Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1987. In 1990, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Stanford Law School.

==Career==
Gonzalez began working as a trial lawyer at the Office of the Public Defender in San Francisco in 1991. Gonzalez served one term on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 2001 to 2005. He was elected president of the board in 2003. After losing the mayoral election in 2003, he chose not to seek re-election.

===Run for District Attorney===
Gonzalez entered politics when he ran for San Francisco District Attorney in 1999. He campaigned to halt political corruption and marijuana prosecutions. Gonzalez lost to incumbent Terence Hallinan. In a field of five candidates, he finished third with 20,153 votes (11 percent of the total).
===Board of Supervisors===

====Election====
A system of electing supervisors by district rather than citywide took effect in 2000. At the urging of Supervisor Tom Ammiano, Gonzalez moved from his home in the Mission District to run for supervisor in newly made District 5. In early November, shortly before the runoff election, Gonzalez switched party affiliations from the Democratic Party to the nascent Green Party. His opponent, Juanita Owens, tried to capitalize on many Democrats&#x27; ill feelings toward the Green Party in the wake of Ralph Nader&#x27;s involvement in the acrimonious 2000 presidential election, but Gonzalez won the runoff election. He was part of a slate of candidates who wanted to change the direction of city policy, in opposition to the &quot;Brown machine,&quot; a Democratic Party political machine that had dominated local politics for over 30 years behind Mayor Willie Brown, the Pelosi family, and other Democrats. His supporters saw his election as a turning point in local politics.
====On the board====
Gonzalez&#x27;s critics considered him a stubborn and willful ideologue, though supporters noted his commitment to stand firm on principles over politicking. When the Board put forth a resolution commending San Franciscan Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi for being elected House Minority Whip and being the first woman to hold that position, Gonzalez was the only board member who voted against it. Gonzalez said that supervisors should not issue commendations for winning partisan political positions and that he had written a personal note to Pelosi congratulating her, as she had done him for being elected board president. Gonzalez refused to meet with Brown during his first two years on the Board of Supervisors, saying he did so to avoid being subject to Brown&#x27;s influence rather than as a matter of disrespect. Two sources reported that Gonzalez defied Brown by walking out of the mayor&#x27;s State of the City address in 2002. However, Gonzalez later told &quot;SF Weekly&quot; that he was never in attendance.

====As board president====
In January 2003, Gonzalez was elected president of the Board of Supervisors after seven rounds of voting, most of which had Gonzalez vying for a majority vote with supervisors Aaron Peskin and Sophie Maxwell. When Peskin dropped out Gonzalez emerged the winner, counting among his supporters conservative Board member Tony Hall, who said when asked why he voted for Gonzalez, &quot;Gonzalez is a man of integrity and intelligence who will carry out his responsibilities fairly and impartially.&quot;

Gonzalez hosted monthly art exhibits in his City Hall office. At the last reception, graffiti artist Barry McGee spray-painted &quot;Smash the State&quot; on the walls of the office as part of his exhibit.&quot; Gonzalez told the press that he knew his office would be repainted for the next occupant.

===Campaign for mayor===
In August 2003, Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco in a bid to replace outgoing two-term mayor Willie Brown. On a ballot with nine candidates, Gonzalez finished second in the primary election on November 4 behind Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and fellow member of the Board of Supervisors who had been endorsed by Brown. Gonzalez received 19.6 percent of the total vote to Newsom&#x27;s 41.9 percent. Because none of the candidates received a majority, a run-off election was held on December 9.

Gonzalez faced a difficult run-off election; only 3 percent of voters in San Francisco were registered to the Green Party, the party to which he belonged. Although Gonzalez was endorsed by several key local Democrats, including five members of the Board of Supervisors, national Democratic figures, concerned about Ralph Nader&#x27;s role in the 2000 presidential election, campaigned on Newsom&#x27;s behalf. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, Dianne Feinstein, and Nancy Pelosi all campaigned for Newsom. Gonzalez said about his candidacy, &quot;They&#x27;re scared, not of a Green being elected mayor, but of an honest person being elected mayor.&quot; Newsom won the runoff race by a margin of 11,000 votes, capturing 53 percent of the vote to Gonzalez&#x27;s 47 percent.

===Return to private life===

Following the mayoral contest, Gonzalez announced he would not seek re-election to the Board of Supervisors. He left office when his term ended in January 2005. He was succeeded by Ross Mirkarimi, a Green Party member and community activist who had also worked on Gonzalez&#x27;s campaign. Gonzalez then opened law offices with fellow Stanford University alum Whitney Leigh. In May 2005 Gonzalez sought unsuccessfully to overturn the contract of San Francisco school Superintendent Arlene Ackerman. His law firm brought suit against a San Francisco hotel for not paying its workers the minimum wage; two wrongful death suits against Sacramento police for using tasers; against the city of San Jose and Ringling Brothers Circus for interfering with free speech rights of protestors; and against Clear Channel in a naming rights dispute over the locally owned San Francisco Warfield Theatre. It has also been involved in examining the New Year&#x27;s Eve attack on the Yale a cappella group &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Dozen&quot; in Pacific Heights.

===2008 presidential election===
In January 2008, Gonzalez, along with several other prominent Green Party members, launched Ralph Nader&#x27;s 2008 Presidential Exploratory Committee to support a possible Nader candidacy. On February 28, 2008, four days after announcing his presidential bid, Nader named Gonzalez as his running mate for the 2008 presidential election.

Nader announced that he and Gonzalez would not seek the Green Party nomination but would run as independents. On March 4, 2008, Gonzalez announced that he had left the Green Party and had changed his voter registration to independent. The change, he said, was to accommodate states, including Delaware, Idaho and Oregon, that did not allow members of political parties to run as independents.

On October 18, 2008 Gonzalez and Nader held a large protest on Wall Street following the passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Their opposition to the bailout was a key issue of the Nader/Gonzalez campaign, in contrast to the Democratic and Republican Party candidates who supported the bill.

Gonzalez participated in the third party vice-presidential debates, along with Constitution Party vice-presidential candidate Darrell Castle and Libertarian Wayne Allyn Root, held in Las Vegas, on November 2, 2008. The event was hosted by Free and Equal.org and Free &amp; Equal Elections (FREE), an organization of political parties, independent citizens and civic organizations formed to promote free and equal elections in the United States.

===Public Defender&#x27;s Office===
Jeff Adachi appointed Gonzalez as Chief Attorney in the Public Defender&#x27;s Office in February 2011.

In 2012, Gonzalez took a month-long unpaid leave of absence to act as co-counsel for a corporation in its $16 million lawsuit against San Francisco. This was a civil suit, and as such was not a violation of the San Francisco Public Defender&#x27;s office rules of ethics, which states in part, &quot;No employee may provide legal advice or legal representation...to any person or entity other than in the employee&#x27;s official capacity.&quot; The case involved Cobra Solutions, a minority-owned business, that had been wrongfully suspended from being able to bid on city information technology contracts. The article “How Business Was Done,” by Luke Thomas, published in 48 Hills, February 14, 2012, explained the key features of the litigation.

Gonzalez defended José Inez García Zárate in the Kate Steinle homicide trial. The trial received national media attention because the defendant was an undocumented immigrant who had previously been deported five times. Zarate, 45, was found not guilty of assault with a firearm but was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Zárate was sentenced to time already served.

After the death of Jeff Adachi on 22 February 2019, Gonzalez served briefly as head of the public defender&#x27;s office until an interim head, Manohar ‘Mano’ Raju, was named. Mano was appointed Public Defender on March 11.

<text>Petar Stefanov Stoyanov (, born 25 May 1952) is a Bulgarian statesman and politician who served as the 2nd President of Bulgaria from 1997 to 2002. A member of the Union of Democratic Forces, he won the second democratic election in modern Bulgarian history. Throughout Stoyanov’s presidency, Bulgaria made substantial progress in its efforts of joining NATO and the European Union.

== Biography ==
Stoyanov was born on 25 May 1952, in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. After graduating from secondary school, Stoyanov entered the Saint Kliment Ohridski University of Sofia law faculty where he graduated with honors in 1976. He practiced civil law in Plovdiv through the next fifteen years. In addition to his mother tongue Bulgarian, Stoyanov also speaks English and German .

Stoyanov entered politics in 1990, shortly after the political changes in Bulgaria at the end of 1989. He co-founded and chaired a Democracy Club in Plovdiv and later that same year became spokesman of the Plovdiv Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a new Bulgarian coalition in opposition to the former ruling political parties (BKP and BZNS).

In 1991 Stoyanov joined the country&#x27;s first post-communist government as Deputy Minister of Justice. In 1993 the UDF led government failed a vote of no confidence and was replaced. In May 1993 Stoyanov became a President of the UDF Legal Council.

In 1994, he was elected Member of Parliament and was chosen as Deputy Chairman of the UDF Parliamentary Group, in addition to being Deputy Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on Youth, Sports, and Tourism. In 1995 he became Deputy Chairman of UDF, responsible for domestic policy.

===Presidency===

On 1 June 1996 Petar Stoyanov won the Union Democratic Forces presidential primary, 1996 with 66% of the 870,000 votes cast and thus became the presidential candidate of the UDF. He received a plurality of votes in the first round of the presidential election, ahead of the socialist candidate Ivan Marazov and Bulgarian Business Bloc founder and leader George Ganchev. In the second round he defeated Marazov by a margin of 19.5%.

Stoyanov was sworn in as President on 19 January 1997 and stepped into office on 22 January 1997. He was the first Bulgarian Head of State after the Second World War, who had never been a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

At the beginning of his tenure, Petar Stoyanov played a decisive role in one of the most dramatic crisis in the modern history of Bulgaria. For over a month, tens of thousands of citizens came out in protest against the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) led government. After the resignation of Prime Minister Jean Videnov, the new leader of the BSP, Georgi Parvanov and Videnov&#x27;s proposed successor as Prime Minister, Nikolay Dobrev, visited the newly elected Head of State with a proposed Cabinet. With a majority in the 37th National Assembly, the BSP had the ability to approve the new Cabinet, however President Stoyanov refused to propose it for a vote in Parliament. Instead, on the same day, 4 February 1997, he summoned the National Security Consultative Council, which included representatives from all parties represented in Parliament. During this Consultative Council the BSP were forced to return the mandate to form a new government, and new elections were scheduled. President Stoyanov appointed a Caretaker Government headed by Sofia Mayor Stefan Sofianski, who was a member of the Union of Democratic Forces. Subsequently the UDF received a majority in Parliament and formed a government, which would go on to be Bulgaria&#x27;s first post 1989 government to serve a full term (1997-2001).

At the request of President Stoyanov, the Caretaker Government officially submitted a request for Bulgaria&#x27;s membership in NATO. Petar Stoyanov also played an important role in resolving the Kosovo crisis, strongly supporting the Alliance.

During his presidency Bulgaria entered into active negotiations for accession to the European Union and ratified the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and became a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

The original manuscript of  &quot;Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya&quot; was returned to the monastery library of the Zograf Monastery on 12 January 1998 at his request.

At Stoyanov&#x27;s invitation, a sitting US President visited Bulgaria for the first time, when Bill Clinton made a historic three-day visit between 21 and 23 November 1999.

During his term in office Stoyanov became the first Head of state in the world to sign a law with an electronic signature. Petar Stoyanov has been a member of the Internet Society - Bulgaria, since 21 July 2000.

===2001 Presidential Election===
Petar Stoyanov ran for a second term in 2001, but lost in the second round to Georgi Parvanov, despite the fact that he was initially leading in the polls.

During a TV debate with the other candidates, Stoyanov produced a classified file containing information about one of them, Bogomil Bonev and his alleged contacts with persons of dubious repute. One of the presenters, Ivo Indzhev read it out, while the other one, Svetla Petrova, stated that Stoyanov &quot;risked the winner of the dispute being Georgi Parvanov&quot;, the socialist candidate who was absent. It is believed that Stoyanov&#x27;s actions regarding this classified document deterred many swing voters, who were thus inclined to support Parvanov, due to his more moderate behaviour. 

During the campaign Petar Stoyanov did not receive the full support of any political party. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (a party with strong support from the ethnic Turkish minority in Bulgaria) strongly supported the candidate of the former Communist Party, Georgi Parvanov, despite the oppression that Bulgarian Turks were subjected to during the so-called &quot;Revival process&quot; by the Bulgarian Communist Party. Prior to the start of the campaign, Stoyanov had been supported by the UDF, however the leaders of the party only made ambiguous statements during the campaign itself, which voters were baffled by. NDSV, the new party of former monarch Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, which had won a majority of seats in the parliamentary election earlier that year, had been expected to support Stoyanov. However, the leader of the movement then prime minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha announced that he would not vote in the second round, motivated by the desire to save the state the cost of the trip to the village of Banya, where he was registered and this disheartened his followers and voters.

Petar Stoyanov finished second in the first round of voting with 34.9%, behind the socialist candidate Georgi Parvanov with 36.3%, and ahead of Bogomil Bonev with 19.2%. Stoyanov lost the runoff to Parvanov by a margin of 8.3%.

Petar Stoyanov&#x27;s loss in this election, alongside poor performance in the earlier parliamentary election, marked the beginning of a period of decline for the Union of Democratic Forces.

=== Later political career===
In September 2004, Stoyanov was appointed Special Envoy for Moldova by the OSCE Chairman-in-Office.

In 2005, Stoyanov returned to active politics. He was elected as a member of the 40th National Assembly in the parliamentary election held that year. He then became a member of the European Integration Committee and a member of State Administration Affairs Committee. Because of the UDF&#x27;s poor result (8.4% of the popular vote and 20 out of 240 seats), he became a vocal opponent of party leader Nadezhda Mihailova. On October 1, 2005 the UDF National Conference elected him as Chairman of the party.

On 20 May 2007 the first European Parliament election in Bulgaria was held. Stoyanov – who led the UDF list – failed to get elected as UDF fell 1% short of the 5.66% effective electoral threshold. This resulted in his resignation from the leadership of the Union of Democratic Forces on 22 May 2007.

===Other===
Stoyanov serves as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity. In 2002, as a fellow of The German Marshall Fund, Petar Stoyanov delivered lectures in the US at John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, New York University, American Bar Association (Washington, DC) and other universities.

In 2022 Stoyanov, together with Iuliana Metodieva and Mitko Novkov of &quot;Association for Human Rights Marginalia&quot; launched a campaign to honor volunteers and organizations who help refugees from Ukraine during the refugee crisis in Bulgaria following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The grand prize for overall contribution was given to Olena Kotseva from the &quot;Mati Ukraine&quot; association.

== Family ==
He is married to Antonina Stoyanova and has a son Stefan (born 1979) and a daughter Fany (born 1990). His younger brother, Emil Stoyanov, is a former MEP from GERB.

==Honours and awards==

<doc id="420724" wikidata="Q13370881" url="?curid=420724" title="Verdict">
<text>In law, a verdict is the formal finding of fact made by a jury on matters or questions submitted to the jury by a judge. In a bench trial, the judge&#x27;s decision near the end of the trial is simply referred to as a finding. In England and Wales, a coroner&#x27;s findings used to be called verdicts but are, since 2009, called conclusions (see ).

==Etymology==
The term &quot;verdict&quot;, from the Latin &quot;veredictum&quot;, literally means &quot;to say the truth&quot; and is derived from Middle English &quot;verdit&quot;, from Anglo-Norman: a compound of &quot;ver&quot; (&quot;true&quot;, from the Latin &quot;vērus&quot;) and &quot;dit&quot; (&quot;speech&quot;, from the Latin &quot;dictum&quot;, the neuter past participle of &quot;dīcere&quot;, to say).

==Criminal law==

In a criminal case, the verdict, either &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;guilty&quot;—except in Scotland where the verdict of &quot;not proven&quot; is also available—is handed down by the jury. Different counts in the same case may have different verdicts.

A verdict of guilty in a criminal case generally requires evidence to be tested and true beyond reasonable doubt and is normally followed by a judgment of conviction rendered by judge, which in turn be followed by sentencing.

In U.S. legal nomenclature, the verdict is the jury&#x27;s finding on the questions of fact submitted to it. Once the court (the judge) receives the verdict, the judge enters judgment on the verdict. The judgment of the court is the final order in the case. If the defendant is found guilty, they can choose to appeal the case to the local Court of Appeals.

==Compromise verdict==
A compromise verdict is a &quot;verdict which is reached only by the surrender of conscientious convictions upon one material issue by some jurors in return for a relinquishment by others of their like settled opinion upon another issue, and the result does not command the approval of the whole panel&quot;, and, as such, is not permitted.

==Directed verdict==
In a jury trial, a directed verdict is an order from the presiding judge to the jury to return a particular verdict. Typically, the judge orders a directed verdict after finding that no reasonable jury could decide to the contrary. After a directed verdict, the jury no longer needs to decide the case.

A judge may order a directed verdict on an entire case or only on specific issues.

In a criminal case in the United States, once the prosecution has closed its case, the defendant may move for a directed verdict. If granted, the verdict will be &quot;not guilty&quot;. The prosecution may never seek a directed verdict of guilty, as the defendant has a constitutional right to present a defense and rebut the prosecution&#x27;s case and have a jury determine guilt or innocence (where a defendant has waived their right to a jury trial and allowed the judge to render the verdict, this still applies).

In the American civil legal system, the concept of directed verdict has largely been replaced by judgment as a matter of law.

In England and Wales, the equivalent motion, likewise made by the defence after the prosecution rests, is known as a motion of no case to answer. The judge may not direct a verdict of guilty under any circumstances: see &quot;R v Wang&quot;.

==General verdict==
A general verdict is when the jury makes a complete finding and a single conclusion on all issues presented. First, the jury finds the facts, as proved by the evidence, then applies the law as instructed by the court, and finally, it returns a verdict in one conclusion that settles the case. Such verdict is reported as follows:

==Sealed verdict==
A sealed verdict is put into a sealed envelope when there is a delay in announcing the result, such as waiting for the judge, the parties, and the attorneys to return to court. The verdict is kept in a sealed envelope until the court reconvenes and then handed to the judge. This practice is virtually the default in many U.S. jurisdictions or may be the preference of the judge involved.

==Special verdict==
In English law, a special verdict is a verdict by a jury that makes specific factual conclusions rather than (or in addition to) the jury&#x27;s declaration of guilt or liability. For example, jurors may write down a specific monetary amount of damages or a finding of proportionality in addition to the jury&#x27;s ultimate finding of liability. A special jury verdict form may be used to have the jury answer directed questions as to the required elements for a cause of action or special issues and to demarcate monetary awards of damages by economic and non-economic damages, beneficiary, and specific categories of damages (lost earning capacity, funeral expenses, loss of consortium, pain and suffering, etc.). In the words of William Blackstone, &quot;The jury state the naked facts, as they find them to be proved, and pray the advice of the court thereon&quot;. Special verdicts are intended to focus the jury&#x27;s attention on the important questions at hand.

The judge forced a special verdict in the famous 1884 case of &quot;R v. Dudley and Stephens&quot;, which established a precedent that necessity is not a defence to a charge of murder but, generally, it is recommended that such verdicts should only be returned in the most exceptional cases.

The jury has a historic function of tempering rules of law by common sense brought to bear upon the facts of a specific case. For this reason, Justices Black and Douglas indicated their disapproval of special verdicts even in civil cases.

<doc id="420731" wikidata="Q1092075" url="?curid=420731" title="California ground squirrel">
<text>The California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi), also known as the Beechey ground squirrel, is a common and easily observed ground squirrel of the western United States and the Baja California Peninsula; it is common in Oregon and California and its range has relatively recently extended into Washington and northwestern Nevada. Formerly placed in &quot;Spermophilus&quot;, as &quot;Spermophilus beecheyi&quot;, it was reclassified in &quot;Otospermophilus&quot; in 2009, as it became clear that &quot;Spermophilus&quot; as previously defined was not a natural (monophyletic) group. A full species account was published for this species in 2016.

== Etymology ==

John Richardson, who originally described the species as &quot;Arctomys (Spermophilus) beecheyi&quot;, or &quot;Beechey&#x27;s marmot&quot;, named it after Frederick William Beechey, an early 19th-century British explorer and naval officer.

== Description ==

The squirrel&#x27;s upper parts are mottled, with the fur containing a mixture of gray, light brown and dusky hairs. The shoulders, neck and sides are a lighter gray. The fur around the eyes is whitish. The underside is lighter, buff or grayish yellow. Head and body are about long and the tail an additional . They can weigh from . The tail is relatively bushy for a ground squirrel, and at a quick glance, the squirrel might be mistaken for a fox squirrel.

As is typical for ground squirrels, California ground squirrels live in burrows, which they excavate themselves. Some burrows are occupied communally, but each squirrel has its own entrance. Although they readily become tame in areas used by humans, and quickly learn to take food left or offered by picnickers, they spend most of their time within 25 m (80 ft) of their burrows, and rarely go further than from it.

In the colder parts of their range, California ground squirrels hibernate for several months, but in areas where winters have no snow, most squirrels are active year-round. In those parts where the summers are hot, they may also estivate for periods of a few days.

California ground squirrels are often regarded as pests in gardens and parks, since they eat ornamental plants and trees. They commonly feed on seeds, such as oats, but also eat insects such as crickets and grasshoppers, as well as various fruits.
The dental formula of &quot;O. beecheyi&quot; is .

== Life history ==

California ground squirrels&#x27; mating season is early spring and tends to last only for a few weeks. The females are considered to be promiscuous, so the individuals of one litter can be from multiple mates. The California ground squirrel has one litter of five to eleven per year, with gestation around one month. The young open their eyes at about five weeks and reach sexual maturity around one year old.

The coloration of the young is slightly lighter than the adults, and molting occurs at about eight weeks of age – when the young leave the burrows. California ground squirrels can live up to six years.

== Food and feeding ==

California ground squirrels use their cheek pouches to store more food than can be consumed in one sitting for a later date. They are considered to be mostly herbivorous, with seeds, grains, nuts, fruits, and sometimes roots constituting most of their diet.

In a study published in December 2024, California ground squirrels were observed hunting and eating voles.

== Predators ==

California ground squirrels are frequently preyed on by rattlesnakes. They are also preyed on by eagles, raccoons, foxes, badgers, and weasels. Interdisciplinary research at the University of California, Davis, since the 1970s has shown that the squirrels use a variety of techniques to reduce rattlesnake predation. Some populations have varying levels of resistance to rattlesnake venom as adults. Female squirrels with pups also chew on the skins shed by rattlesnakes and then lick themselves and their pups (that are never resistant to venom before one month of age) to disguise their scent. Sand-kicking and other forms of harassment provoke the snake to rattle its tail, which allows a squirrel to assess the size and activity level (dependent on blood temperature) of the snake.

Another strategy is for a squirrel to super-heat and swish around its tail. When hunting, rattlesnakes primarily rely on their pit organ, which detects infrared radiation. The hot tail-swishing appears to convey the message &quot;I am not a threat, but I am too big and swift-moving for it to be worth trying to hunt me.&quot; These two confrontational techniques also distract the snake from any nearby squirrel burrows containing pups.

The swishing of the tail from side to side is called tail-waving, which helps the squirrel to deter a snake attack. The snakes attacked the squirrels that exhibited the tail-waving at a shorter distance than those that did not and majority of those tail-waving squirrels successfully dodged these attacks. This successful dodging, along with the fact that the adult squirrels are larger than the young ones, helps to deter the predators, as the rattlesnakes are 1.6 times more likely to be deterred from attacking an area after an encounter with an adult squirrel. In 30 out of 45 interactions with snakes, the tail-waving behavior of the squirrels stopped the snake in its tracks and the snake attempted to wait for the squirrel to leave before it would consider attacking again, showing that the behavior does deter predatory attacks by the rattlesnakes. This is due to the adult squirrels being vigilant and looking more threatening and also that they are able to more successfully dodge attacks. They also can use their tail-waving to signal to other ground squirrels in the area that a rattlesnake or other predator has recently been spotted. Though the ground squirrels have been found to also exhibit this tail-waving behavior when no predator is present, they wave their tails faster and for a longer time when they spot a predator or in an area where a predator has recently been spotted.

Vigilant behavior in squirrels is also a defense mechanism to avoid predation. In addition to the tail-waving, the squirrels have been found to be more vigilant and on alert if a predator had recently been in the area than they were if no predator had been detected. If the ground squirrels are aware that they are in an area where the rattlesnakes have recently been, they devote more time to being alert and searching for the predators than to hunting and foraging than in an environment where they do not believe predators exist. These vigilant squirrels were found to have a faster reaction time to a stimulus from a predator and jump higher and further away than a squirrel that was not as vigilant. In a simulated environment study, 60% of squirrels that were in an environment with a recent snake encounter exhibited an evasive leap behavior, which propels them farther away from their attackers; 20% of squirrels exhibited this behavior in a primary encounter with a snake and roughly 5% of squirrels exhibited this behavior when no snake was present and no threat was detected. This shows that the squirrels are more alert, vigilant, and ready for an attacker after one has been recently seen.

<text>Ground squirrels are rodents of the squirrel family (Sciuridae) that generally live on the ground or in burrows, rather than in trees like the tree squirrels. The term is most often used for the medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots (genus &quot;Marmota&quot;) or prairie dogs, while the smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks (genus &quot;Tamias&quot;).

Together, they make up the &quot;marmot tribe&quot; of squirrels, Marmotini, a clade within the large and mainly ground squirrel subfamily Xerinae, and containing six living genera. Well-known members of this largely Holarctic group are the marmots (&quot;Marmota&quot;), including the American groundhog, the chipmunks, the susliks (&quot;Spermophilus&quot;), and the prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys&quot;). They are highly variable in size and habitus, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for prolonged periods. They also tend to be far more gregarious than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures. Most Marmotini are rather short-tailed and large squirrels. At up to or more, certain marmots are the heaviest squirrels.

The chipmunks of the genus &quot;Tamias&quot; frequently spend time in trees. Also closer to typical squirrels in other aspects, they are occasionally considered a tribe of their own (Tamiini).

==Evolution and systematics==
&quot;Palaeosciurus&quot; from Europe is the oldest known ground squirrel species, and it does not seem to be particularly close to any of the two to three living lineages (subtribes) of Marmotini. The oldest fossils are from the Early Oligocene, more than 30 million years ago (Mya), but the genus probably persisted at least until the mid-Miocene, some 15 Mya.

Where the Marmotini originated is unclear. The subtribes probably diverged in the early to mid-Oligocene, as primitive marmots and chipmunks are known from the Late Oligocene of North America. The fossil record of the &quot;true&quot; ground squirrels is less well known, beginning only in the mid-Miocene, when modern susliks and prairie dogs are known to have inhabited their present-day range already.

Whether the Marmotini dispersed between North America and Eurasia via &quot;island-hopping&quot; across the Bering Straits or the Greenland region—both of which were temperate habitat at that time—and from which continent they dispersed to which, or if both continents brought forth distinct subtribes which then spread to the other, is not known and would probably require more fossil material to be resolved. In any case, the fairly comprehensive fossil record of Europe—at the relevant time separated from Asia by the Turgai Sea—lacks ancient Marmotini except the indeterminate &quot;Palaeosciurus&quot;, which might be taken to indicate an East Asian or western North American origin with trans-Beringia dispersal being the slightly more satisfying hypothesis. This is also supported by the enigmatic Chinese genus &quot;Sciurotamias&quot;, which may be the most ancient living lineage of this group, or—if the chipmunks are not included here—close to the common ancestor of the Tamiini and the Marmotini &quot;sensu stricto&quot;.

In any case, expansion of the Marmotini to Africa was probably prevented by competitive exclusion by their close relatives the Protoxerini and Xerini—the native terrestrial and palm squirrels of that continent, which must have evolved at the same time as the Marmotini did.

=== Size ===
Ground squirrels can measure anywhere from about in height up to nearly . They can weigh between and .

=== Habitat ===
Open areas including rocky outcrops, fields, pastures, and sparsely wooded hillsides comprise their habitat. Ground squirrels also live in grassy areas such as pastures, golf courses, cemeteries, and parks.

=== Defense mechanisms ===
Ground squirrels have developed several defense mechanisms to protect themselves from predators. When threatened, they emit high-pitched warning calls to alert others in their colony. This alarm call serves as an early warning system, allowing nearby squirrels to seek cover. The squirrels spend about one-third of their time standing to watch and when a predator is in sight, they stop and watch 60% of the time. Ground squirrels are also known for their burrowing behavior. They have intricate tunnel systems with multiple entrances, which provide escape routes from predators. When a threat approaches, they quickly retreat underground, where they are safe from most predators. Their burrows are designed with multiple chambers and ranges between , making it challenging for predators to reach them. This combination of vocal warnings and burrow construction makes ground squirrels highly adapted to evade danger and survive in the wild.

=== Diet ===
Ground squirrels are omnivorous, and not only eat a diet rich in fungi, nuts, fruits, and seeds, but also occasionally eat insects, eggs, and other small animals.

<doc id="420737" wikidata="Q205129" url="?curid=420737" title="Tin pest">
<text>Tin pest is an autocatalytic, allotropic transformation of the element tin, which causes deterioration of tin objects at low temperatures. Tin pest has also been called &quot;tin disease&quot;, &quot;tin blight&quot;, &quot;tin plague&quot;, or &quot;tin leprosy&quot;. It is an autocatalytic process, accelerating once it begins. It was first documented in the scientific literature in 1851, having been observed in the pipes of pipe organs in medieval churches that had experienced cool climates.

With the adoption of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in Europe, and similar regulations elsewhere, traditional lead/tin solder alloys in electronic devices have been replaced by nearly pure tin, introducing tin pest and related problems such as tin whiskers.

==Allotropic transformation==
At and below, pure tin transforms from the silvery, ductile metallic allotrope of β-form &quot;white tin&quot; to the brittle, nonmetallic, α-form &quot;grey tin&quot; with a diamond cubic structure. The transformation is slow to initiate due to a high activation energy but the presence of germanium (or crystal structures of similar form and size) or very low temperatures of roughly −30 °C aids the initiation. There is also a large volume increase of about 27% associated with the phase change to the nonmetallic low temperature allotrope. This frequently makes tin objects (like buttons) decompose into powder during the transformation, hence the name &quot;tin pest&quot;. The decomposition will catalyze itself, which is why the reaction accelerates once it starts. The mere presence of tin pest leads to tin pest. Tin objects at low temperatures will simply disintegrate.
==Possible historical examples==
===Scott expedition to Antarctica===
In 1910 British polar explorer Robert Scott hoped to be the first to reach the South Pole, but was beaten by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. On foot, the expedition trudged through the frozen deserts of the Antarctic, marching for caches of food and kerosene deposited on the way. In early 1912, at the first cache, there was no kerosene; the cans – soldered with tin – were empty. The cause of the empty tins could have been related to tin pest. The tin cans were recovered and no tin pest was found when analyzed by the Tin Research Institute. Some observers blame poor quality soldering, as tin cans over 80 years old have been discovered in Antarctic buildings with the soldering in good condition.

===Napoleon&#x27;s buttons===
The story is often told of Napoleon&#x27;s men freezing in the bitter Russian Winter, their clothes falling apart as tin pest ate the buttons. This appears to be an urban legend, as there is no evidence of any failing buttons, and thus they cannot have been a contributing factor in the failure of the invasion. Uniform buttons of that era were generally bone for enlisted, and brass for officers. Critics of the theory point out that any tin that might have been used would have been quite impure, and thus more tolerant of low temperatures. Laboratory tests of the time required for unalloyed tin to develop significant tin pest damage at lowered temperatures is about 18 months, which is more than twice the length of the invasion. Nevertheless, some of the regiments in the campaign did have tin buttons and the temperature reached sufficiently low values (below −40 °C or °F). In the event, none of the many survivors&#x27; tales mention problems with buttons and it has been suggested that the legend is an amalgamation of reports of blocks of Banca tin completely disintegrated in a customs warehouse in St. Petersburg in 1868, and earlier Russian reports that cast-in buttons for military uniforms also disintegrated, and the desperate state of Napoleon&#x27;s army, having turned soldiers into ragged beggars.

==Modern tin pest since adoption of RoHS==

With the 2006 adoption of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in the European Union, California banning most uses of lead, and similar regulations elsewhere, the problem of tin pest has returned, since some manufacturers which previously used tin/lead alloys now use predominantly tin-based alloys. For example, the leads of some electrical and electronic components are plated with pure tin. In cold environments, this can change to α-modification &quot;grey tin&quot;, which is not electrically conductive, and falls off the leads. After reheating, it changes back to β-modification &quot;white tin&quot;, which is electrically conductive. This cycle can cause electrical short circuits and failure of equipment. Such problems can be intermittent as the powdered particles of tin move around. Tin pest can be avoided by alloying with small amounts of electropositive metals or semimetals soluble in tin&#x27;s solid phase, e.g. antimony or bismuth, which prevent the phase change.

<doc id="420739" wikidata="Q877066" url="?curid=420739" title="The Book of Mozilla">
<text>The Book of Mozilla is a computer Easter egg found in the Netscape, Mozilla, SeaMonkey, Waterfox and Firefox series of web browsers.
It is viewed by directing the browser to .

There is no real book titled &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;. However, apparent quotations hidden in Netscape and Mozilla give this impression by revealing passages in the style of apocalyptic literature, such as the Book of Revelation in the Bible. When is typed into the location bar, various versions of these browsers display a cryptic message in white text on a maroon background in the browser window.

There are eight official verses of &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; which have been included in shipping releases, although various unofficial verses can be found on the Internet. All eight official verses have scriptural chapter and verse references, although these are actually references to important dates in the history of Netscape and Mozilla.

The eight verses all refer to the activities of a fearsome-sounding &quot;beast&quot;. In its early days, Netscape Communications had a green fire-breathing dragon-like lizard mascot, known as Mozilla (after the code name for Netscape Navigator 1.0). From this, it can be conjectured that the &quot;beast&quot; referred to in &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; is a type of fire-breathing lizard, which can be viewed as a metaphor for, or personification of Netscape.

While part of the appeal of &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; comes from the mysterious nature, a knowledge of the history of Netscape and Mozilla can be used to extract some meaning from the verses. Furthermore, the Book of Mozilla page has annotations for each of the first, second, third and fifth verses hidden as comments in its HTML source code. These comments were written by Valerio Capello in May 2004 and were added to the Mozilla Foundation site by Nicholas Bebout in October that year. Neither Capello nor Bebout are &#x27;core&#x27; Mozilla decision-makers; and there is no evidence that Capello&#x27;s interpretations received any high-level approval from the senior management of the Mozilla Foundation.

== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 12:10 ==
&quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; first appeared in Netscape 1.1 (released in 1995) and can be found in every subsequent 1.x, 2.x, 3.x and 4.x version. The following &quot;prophecy&quot; was displayed:


The chapter and verse number 12:10 refers to December 10, 1994, the date that Netscape Navigator 1.0 was released.

The Book of Mozilla page, which includes seven verses from &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, contains the following explanation in its HTML source code:

&lt;!-- 10th December 1994: Netscape Navigator 1.0 was released --&gt;
&lt;!-- This verse announces the birth of the beast (Netscape) and warns bad coders (up to Netscape 3, when you watched the HTML source code with the internal viewer, bad tags blinked). --&gt;
The &quot;beast&quot; is a metaphor for Netscape. The punishments threatened towards the &quot;unbelievers&quot; (most likely users who didn&#x27;t conform to standards) are traditionally biblical but with the strange threat that their &quot;tags shall blink until the end of days&quot;. This is a reference to a feature in early versions of Netscape that would make bad tags blink, as seen in the source code comments from the Book of Mozilla.
== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 3:31 ==
On May 10, 1998, Jamie &quot;JWZ&quot; Zawinski changed &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; verse to reference the fact that Netscape had released its code as open source and started the Mozilla project. This verse was included in all Mozilla builds until October 1998, when a rewrite of much of the Mozilla code meant that the Easter egg was lost. On February 5, 2000, Ben Goodger, then working for Netscape, copied &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; verse across to the new code base. It was included in all subsequent Mozilla builds (until the introduction of the 7:15 verse), Netscape versions 6 to 7.1 and Beonex Communicator; it still appears in Classilla due to that browser&#x27;s unusual history.

The verse states:

The chapter and verse number 3:31 refers to March 31, 1998, when Netscape released its source code.

The Book of Mozilla page has the following comment in its HTML source about this passage:
&lt;!-- 31st March 1998: the Netscape Navigator source code was released --&gt;
&lt;!-- The source code is made available to the legion of thousands of coders of the open source community, that will fight against the followers of Mammon (Microsoft Internet Explorer). --&gt;
Again, the &quot;beast&quot; is Netscape. The text probably refers to Netscape&#x27;s hope that, by opening its source, they could attract a &quot;legion&quot; of developers all across the world, who would help improve the software (with the &quot;din of a million keyboards&quot;). The &quot;legion&quot; is actually a reference to the biblical quote Mark 5:9 in the King James Version (KJV) bible (&quot;And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.&quot;), since The Book of Mozilla is presented as a sort of &quot;computer bible&quot; with prophecies. &quot;Mammon&quot; refers to Microsoft, whose Internet Explorer browser was Netscape&#x27;s chief competition. The word &quot;mammon,&quot; in various Semitic languages, is related to money and riches; it appears in English translations of the Bible, and is sometimes used as the name of a demon of avarice. It may therefore imply not only that Microsoft has vastly greater funds to draw on, but that it has greedily abused that fact to further its own position in the marketplace; it also highlights the difference between the purely commercial development of Internet Explorer, and the new community-driven development of Netscape/Mozilla. &quot;Red Letter Edition&quot; may be a reference to so-called Red Letter Editions of the Bible, which print quotations by Jesus in red ink. It could also be a reference to a fact that March 31, 1998 was a red-letter day for the Mozilla project.
== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 7:15 ==
The next installment of &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot; was written by Neil Deakin. It is included in all versions of Mozilla released from September 2003 to July 2008 (Mozilla 1.5 – Mozilla Firefox 3.0 Beta 2), all versions of Camino, all versions of the Mozilla Thunderbird email client until 2.0.0.24, all versions of the SeaMonkey application suite until 1.1.19, the Epiphany web browser (version 1.8.0), the Minimo Pocket PC web browser, and all Netscape versions from 7.2 to 8.1.3 (except some Netscape Browser prototype releases):


The 7:15 chapter and verse notation refers to July 15, 2003, the day when America Online shut down its Netscape browser division and the Mozilla Foundation was launched.

In the HTML source of Book of Mozilla page, this verse is accompanied by the following annotation:
&lt;!-- 15th July 2003: AOL closed its Netscape division and the Mozilla foundation was created --&gt;
&lt;!-- The beast died (AOL closed its Netscape division) but immediately rose from its ashes (the creation of the Mozilla foundation and the Firebird browser, although the name was later changed to Firefox). --&gt;
The &quot;beast&quot; falling refers to Netscape being closed down by its now parent company AOL. The &quot;great bird&quot; that rises from the ash is the Mozilla Foundation, which was established to continue Mozilla development. The bird rises from the ash like a phoenix – a reference to the original name of the Mozilla Firefox browser (known as Firebird at the time this verse was written). The bird casts down &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;thunder&quot; on the &quot;unbelievers&quot;, which is a direct reference to the Mozilla Firebird (now Firefox) and Mozilla Thunderbird products, which became the main focus of Mozilla development a few months before the events of July 15. The fact that the beast has been &quot;reborn&quot; indicates that the spirit of Netscape will live on through the Foundation (which is made up mostly of ex-Netscape employees) and its strength has been &quot;renewed&quot; as the foundation is less reliant on AOL (who many feel neglected Netscape). Again, &quot;Mammon&quot; is Microsoft, Mozilla&#x27;s main commercial competitor.
== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 8:20 ==
Netscape&#x27;s lead browser engineer Christopher Finke contributed the next verse of &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;. It was first made public in the June 5, 2007 release of Netscape Navigator 9.0b1.
The verse was included in all subsequent versions of Netscape, until the final discontinuation of the browser (Netscape Navigator 9.0b1 - 9.0.0.6).

The 8:20 chapter and verse notation refers to August 20, 2006, when the first internal email was sent mentioning the possibility of developing the next Netscape Navigator in house.

Unlike previous verses, the HTML source for the Book of Mozilla page does not feature any verse-related annotations.

The &quot;Creator&quot; refers to Netscape the company. There are two interpretations of the verse: the phrase &quot;beast reborn&quot; appears in the previous verse referring to the Mozilla Foundation and &quot;it was good&quot; could be a tribute to everyone who contributed to the Mozilla project. &quot;Beast reborn&quot; could also be a reference to Netscape reopening their browser division instead of outsourcing development; Netscape Browser 8 was produced by Mercurial Communications.

This verse of God&#x27;s creation of Earth as described in Genesis 1:4, 1:10, 1:12, 1:18, 1:21, 1:25, and 1:31 of the Bible. It also may be referencing Luke 3:22 of the Bible.

== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 11:9 ==


This verse landed in the Mozilla trunk codebase on January 9, 2008.
It was included in Firefox 3.0 Beta 3 through 20.0.1, SeaMonkey 2.0 Alpha 1 through 2.17.1, Thunderbird 3.0 Alpha 1 through 20 Beta 1, Mobile Firefox Alpha 1, Flock Browser Version 2.0.6, Waterfox, and Songbird.

In the HTML source of the Book of Mozilla page, this verse is accompanied by the following annotation:
&lt;!-- 9th November 2004: Firefox 1.0 is officially released --&gt;
&lt;!-- The worldwide support of Firefox fans leads to its success, illustrating the power of community-based open source projects. --&gt;
&quot;Mammon&quot; is again Internet Explorer, which &quot;slept&quot; for the 5 years between releases (between Internet Explorer 6 and 7). The &quot;beast reborn&quot; refers to Firefox, which gained supporters who self-organized through Spread Firefox and undertook publicity for the browser, taking out an advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and making a crop circle shaped like the Firefox logo. The &quot;cunning of foxes&quot; is a direct reference to Firefox&#x27;s name. The &quot;new world&quot; refers to modern, standards-based dynamic websites and open source applications. The latter half of the passage links to the Mozilla Manifesto and the about:Mozilla newsletter. The last part, starting with &quot;Mammon awoke,&quot; speaks of the release of Internet Explorer 7 and with &quot;it was naught but a follower&quot; describes it as a follower, copying several of the functions in Firefox that Internet Explorer previously lacked. Additionally, &quot;10th edition&quot; is an allusion to the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s 10th anniversary, which occurred during the Firefox 3 development cycle.

== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 15:1 ==


This verse landed in the Mozilla trunk codebase on January 23, 2013. It first appeared in the nightly builds of Firefox 21 (Specifically, Firefox 21.0 Alpha 1 build 2013-01-23). Instead of a plain background, it now features a subtle radial gradient.

It is included in all Firefox versions since Firefox 21.0, all SeaMonkey versions since 2.18 Beta 1, and all Thunderbird versions since 21 Beta 1.

The &quot;twins of Mammon&quot; refers to Apple and Google, whose mobile operating systems, respectively iOS and Android, have taken a duopoly of the mobile OS market. The &quot;new darkness&quot; refers to the closed nature of traditional app stores. The beast moving &quot;swiftly&quot; refers to the new rapid release cycle of Firefox. The phrase &quot;went forth and multiplied&quot; refers to &quot;Firefox becoming multiple things&quot; through Firefox for Android and Firefox OS. The verse number 15:1 refers to the code freeze of Firefox OS 1.0 (January 15, 2013).
== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 11:14 ==


This verse first appeared in Firefox Nightly 58, landing in the Mozilla trunk codebase on September 22, 2017, and was later uplifted to show up in Firefox 57 Beta.

It refers to the major changes that culminated in the Firefox 57 release with the Quantum project. &quot;Time and Space&quot; refer to Quantum itself, while &quot;Flow&quot; refers to the Quantum Flow project, &quot;new raiment&quot; and &quot;Light&quot; refer to the UI refresh known as the Photon project. The Quantum Project contained the first major piece of code taken from Servo, the layout engine written in Rust, to which &quot;oxidised metal&quot; is a reference. The 11:14 chapter and verse notation refers to November 14, 2017, the day Firefox 57 was released.
== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 6:27 ==

This verse first appeared in Firefox Nightly 80, landing in the Mozilla trunk codebase on July 22, 2020. According to its annotation, it was intended to be added on June 27, 2019, with the introduction of Firefox Preview.

In the HTML source of the Book of Mozilla page, this verse is accompanied by the following annotation:

&lt;!-- 27th June 2019: Firefox Preview is made available for testing by early adopters --&gt;
&lt;!-- Firefox Focus, Reference Browser, and Firefox Reality all use the new GeckoView as does Firefox for Android which was rebuilt lighter and faster under the code name Fenix prior to release. --&gt;
Emphasized words refer to Firefox Focus, Reference Browser, and Firefox Reality, all of which had switched to the Quantum-based GeckoView for higher performance.

== Behavior in different browsers ==

=== Flock ===

==== &quot;The Book of Mozilla&quot;, 11:1 ====
Though not an official verse by Mozilla, a new verse of the Book of Mozilla, 11:1, became available in Flock Browser 1.0+, a &quot;Social Web Browser&quot; based on Firefox. This verse is shown on blue/white vertical gradient when is entered into the location bar. The verse is as follows.


&quot;And when the beast had taken the quarter of the earth under its rule...&quot; is probably a reference to the 25% market share Firefox had gained over the more popular Internet Explorer. &quot;Birds of Sulfur&quot; references the developmental codename of Flock, which is Sulfur. The &quot;mountain views&quot; references the city of Mountain View, California where the company that produces Flock (as well as Mozilla) was based at the time of writing. The &quot;24 wise men&quot; refer to the 24 staff employees of Flock at that time. The &quot;stars&quot; refer to the star used in the branding (&quot;Flockstar&quot;). Though this verse was released 5 November 2007, much of the meaning is still unclear. &quot;They took their pens and dared to create&quot; is most likely a reference to the blogging and social networking integration in Flock. The section &quot;Finally, they dared to share their deed with the whole of mankind.&quot; could possibly be making a reference to the fact that it is open source, and that they shared their good deed (their creation of the browser) with the world.

=== Internet Explorer ===
In some versions of Internet Explorer, produces a blank blue page referencing the Blue Screen of Death.

The source markup of the page defines the text color as white. The page still can be seen (even in Edge for Windows 10) when using the URL: (however, without using this URL in IE10, it will cancel the webpage navigation). The about page was defined in a registry entry .

=== Iceweasel ===
Due to a dispute with the Mozilla Corporation, the Debian project was forced to change the name and branding of Mozilla Firefox in its distribution. In response, it changed the name to Iceweasel and the icon to a white weasel-like variant of the Firefox logo. Iceweasel includes the Easter-egg and showed the standard page from the Firefox version it was built from. However, when users navigate to they see a thematically similar message from the Book of Ice that describes the dispute with Mozilla and the creation of Iceweasel.

The &quot;Corpse&quot; in this edition represents the Mozilla Corporation and the references to the prohibition on &quot;flying in my name&quot; is a reference to the trademark prohibition.

=== Netscape ===
Starting with Netscape 0.93beta (and up to version 1.0), produced the text &quot;Mozilla Rules!&quot;.

Viewing the page with a Unix version of Netscape would change the throbber to an animation of Mozilla rising up from behind the &quot;planet&quot; logo and breathing fire.

=== Pale Moon ===
Prior to Pale Moon version 26, typing would show the 15:1 verse. However, in Pale Moon 26 and above it displays the following:

This verse is also included (with branding modified) in the custom version of Basilisk included with the Flashpoint archival project, Flashpoint Navigator.

Similarly to Iceweasel, Pale Moon has its own take on The Book of Mozilla, this time dubbed &quot;The Chronicles of the Pale Moon&quot;, which can be viewed by navigating to ; however, instead of the chapter and verse number referring to a date of significance in the browser&#x27;s history, it refers to the version number the verse first appeared in, and instead of being in the middle of the page, the subtle radial gradient is near the top right. In Pale Moon 24.2 to 27.0, the page title read &quot;The Child of the Moon&quot;, and it showed the following text:

The phrase &quot;the form of metal&quot; is a reference to Google&#x27;s Chrome browser.

Since version 27.1 (when Pale Moon became a true fork), the page title reads &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Roots&quot;. The text reads:

The &quot;ancestor&quot; is believed to refer to Firefox, while the &quot;bed of withered roots&quot; is believed to refer to the Firefox ESR 24 codebase.

With the release of Pale Moon 28, the version number references were abandoned. The page title does not contain a title for the verse, and the text reads:

In this verse, the &quot;old nest&quot; is believed to refer to the old Mozilla XUL Platform used by prior versions, which had been abandoned in favour of a fork named UXP under the hood, while retaining the older but customisable interface from Firefox versions 4 through 28.

With version 28.5.0, the page&#x27;s text was once updated:

In this verse, &quot;landscape&quot; seems to refer to the current browser scene, &quot;tainted metal&quot; may be a reference to Chromium (referencing the migration of browsers like Opera and Vivaldi to Chromium), and &quot;sanctuary&quot; may refer to Unified XUL Platform (UXP), which provides a common platform for XUL-based applications to build on.

=== SeaMonkey ===
In versions of SeaMonkey browser later than 2.0, displays the same Book of Mozilla verse from the Firefox trunk build that it was built off of. In some newer versions of SeaMonkey, codice_1 will display a verse similar to &quot;The Book of Mozilla, 3:31 (Red Letter Edition)&quot;, only with few wording changes, and the book&#x27;s name is switched to &quot;The Book of SeaMonkey, 1:30&quot;. It&#x27;s also notable that the background color is changed from maroon to teal (codice_2).

<text>Frederic Sackrider Remington (October 4, 1861 – December 26, 1909) was an American painter, illustrator, sculptor, and writer who specialized in the genre of Western American Art. His works are known for depicting the Western United States in the last quarter of the 19th century and featuring such images as cowboys, American Indians, and the US Cavalry.

== Early life ==
Remington was born in Canton, New York, in 1861 to Seth Pierrepont Remington (1830–1880) and Clarissa (Clara) Bascom Sackrider (1836–1912).

His maternal family owned hardware stores and emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine in the early 18th century. His maternal family, of French Basque ancestry, came to America in the early 1600s and founded Windsor, Connecticut. Remington&#x27;s father was a Union army colonel in the American Civil War, whose family had arrived in America from England in 1637. He was a newspaper editor and postmaster, and the staunchly Republican family was active in local politics. The Remingtons were horsemen. One of Remington&#x27;s great-grandfathers, Samuel Bascom, was a saddle maker by trade. Remington&#x27;s ancestors also fought in the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812.

Remington was a cousin of Eliphalet Remington, founder of the Remington Arms Company, which is considered America&#x27;s oldest gunmaker. He was also related to three famous mountain men: Jedediah Smith, Jonathan T. Warner, and Robert &quot;Doc&quot; Newell. Through the Warner side of his family, Remington was related to George Washington, the first US president.

Colonel Remington was away at war during most of the first four years of his son&#x27;s life. After the war, he moved his family to Bloomington, Illinois for a brief time and was appointed editor of the Bloomington &quot;Republican&quot;, but the family returned to Canton in 1867. Remington was the only child of the marriage, and received constant attention and approval. He was an active child, large and strong for his age, who loved to hunt, swim, ride, and go camping. He was a poor student though, particularly in math, which did not bode well for his father&#x27;s ambitions for his son to attend West Point. He began to make drawings and sketches of soldiers and cowboys at an early age.
The family moved to Ogdensburg, New York when Remington was eleven and he attended Vermont Episcopal Institute, a church-run military school, where his father hoped discipline would rein in his son&#x27;s lack of focus and perhaps lead to a military career. Remington took his first drawing lessons at the Institute. He then transferred to another military school where his classmates found the young Remington to be a pleasant fellow, a bit careless and lazy, good-humored, and generous of spirit but definitely not soldier material. He enjoyed making caricatures and silhouettes of his classmates. At 17, he wrote to his uncle of his modest ambitions, &quot;I never intend to do any great amount of labor. I have but one short life and do not aspire to wealth or fame in a degree which could only be obtained by an extraordinary effort on my part.&quot; He imagined a career for himself as a journalist, with art as a sideline.

Remington attended the art school at Yale University and studied under John Henry Niemeyer. Remington was the only male student in his first year. He found that football and boxing were more interesting than the formal art training, particularly drawing from casts and still life objects. He preferred action drawing and his first published illustration was a cartoon of a &quot;bandaged football player&quot; for the student newspaper, &quot;Yale Courant&quot;. Though he was not a star player, his participation on the strong Yale football team was a great source of pride for Remington and his family. He left Yale in 1879 to tend to his ailing father, who had tuberculosis. His father died a year later, at 50, receiving respectful recognition from the citizens of Ogdensburg. Remington&#x27;s Uncle Mart secured a good-paying clerical job for his nephew in Albany, New York, and Remington would return home on weekends to see his girlfriend Eva Caten. After the rejection of his engagement proposal to Eva by her father, Remington became a reporter for his uncle&#x27;s newspaper and went on to other short-lived jobs.
Living off his inheritance and modest work income, Remington refused to go back to art school and instead spent time camping and enjoying himself. At 19, he made his first trip west, going to Montana, at first to buy a cattle operation and then a mining interest, but realized that he did not have sufficient capital for either. In the American West of 1881, he saw the vast prairies, the quickly shrinking bison herds, the still unfenced cattle, and the last major confrontations of US Cavalry and Native American tribes, scenes he had imagined since his childhood. He also hunted grizzly bears with Montague Stevens in New Mexico in 1895. Though the trip was undertaken as a lark, it gave Remington a more authentic view of the West than some of the later artists and writers who followed in his footsteps, such as N. C. Wyeth and Zane Grey, who arrived twenty-five years later when much of the mythic West had already slipped into history. From that first trip, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; printed Remington&#x27;s first published commercial effort, a re-drawing of a quick sketch on wrapping paper that he had mailed back east. In 1883, Remington went to rural Kansas, south of the city of Peabody near the tiny community of Plum Grove, to try his hand at the booming sheep ranching and wool trade, as one of the &quot;holiday stockmen&quot;, rich young easterners out to make a quick killing as ranch owners. He invested his entire inheritance but found ranching to be a rough, boring, isolated occupation which deprived him of the finer things he was used to from East Coast life, and the real ranchers thought of him as lazy. In 1884, he sold his land.

Remington continued sketching, but at this point his results were still cartoonish and amateur. After less than a year, after he sold his ranch, he went home. After acquiring more capital from his mother, he returned to Kansas City to start a hardware business, but due to an alleged swindle, it failed, and he reinvested his remaining money as a silent, half-owner of a saloon. He went home to marry Eva Caten in 1884. (He had previously asked her father for her hand, but had been turned down -- her father was a widower at the time and felt he needed Eva, but after he had remarried, was more amenable.) The young couple returned to Kansas City immediately. Eva was unhappy with his saloon life and was unimpressed by the sketches of saloon inhabitants that Remington regularly showed her. When his real occupation became known, she left him and returned to Ogdensburg. With his wife gone and with business doing badly, Remington started to sketch and paint in earnest, and bartered his sketches for essentials.

He soon had enough success selling his paintings to locals to see art as a real profession. Remington returned home again, his inheritance gone but his faith in his new career secured, reunited with his wife, and moved to Brooklyn. He began studies at the Art Students League of New York and significantly bolstered his fresh though still rough technique. His timing was excellent, as newspaper interest in the dying West was escalating. He submitted illustrations, sketches, and other works for publication with Western themes to &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, as his recent Western experiences (highly exaggerated) and his hearty, breezy &quot;cowboy&quot; demeanor gained him credibility with the eastern publishers looking for authenticity. His first full-page cover under his own name appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on January 9, 1886, when he was twenty-five. With financial backing from his Uncle Bill, Remington was able to pursue his art career and support his wife.

Several of his relatives were also artists, including Indian portrait artist George Catlin, cowboy sculptor Earl W. Bascom, and (also on the Bascom side) Frank Tenney Johnson, the &quot;father of western moonlight painting&quot;.

== Early career ==

In 1886, Remington was sent to Arizona by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on a commission as an artist-correspondent to cover the government&#x27;s war against Geronimo. Although he never caught up with Geronimo, Remington did acquire many authentic artifacts to be used later as props, and made many photos and sketches valuable for later paintings. He also made notes on the true colors of the West, such as &quot;shadows of horses should be a cool carmine &amp; Blue&quot;, to supplement the black-and-white photos. Ironically, art critics later criticized his palette as &quot;primitive and unnatural&quot; even though it was based on actual observation.

After returning East, Remington was sent by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; to cover the 1886 Charleston earthquake. To expand his commission work, he also began doing drawings for &quot;Outing&quot; magazine. His first year as a commercial artist had been successful, earning Remington $1,200, almost triple that of a typical teacher. He had found his life&#x27;s work and bragged to a friend, &quot;That&#x27;s a pretty good break for an ex cow-puncher to come to New York with $30 and catch on it &#x27;art&#x27;.&quot;
For commercial reproduction in black-and-white, he produced ink and wash drawings. As he added watercolor, he began to sell his work in art exhibitions. His works were selling well but garnered no prizes, as the competition was strong and masters like Winslow Homer and Eastman Johnson were considered his superiors. A trip to Canada in 1887 produced illustrations of the Blackfoot, the Crow Nation, and the Canadian Mounties, which were eagerly enjoyed by the reading public.

Later that year, Remington received a commission to do eighty-three illustrations for a book by Theodore Roosevelt, &quot;Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail&quot; to be serialized in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; before publication. The 29-year-old Roosevelt had a similar Western adventure to Remington, losing money on a ranch in North Dakota the previous year but gaining experience which made him an &quot;expert&quot; on the West. The assignment gave Remington&#x27;s career a big boost and forged a lifelong connection with Roosevelt.
His full-color oil painting &quot;Return of the Blackfoot War Party&quot; was exhibited at the National Academy of Design and the &quot;New York Herald&quot; commented that Remington would &quot;one day be listed among our great American painters&quot;. Though not admired by all critics, Remington&#x27;s work was deemed &quot;distinctive&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;. By now, he was demonstrating the ability to handle complex compositions with ease, as in &quot;Mule Train Crossing the Sierras&quot; (1888), and to show action from all points of view. His status as the new trendsetter in Western art was solidified in 1889 when he won a second-class medal at the Paris Exposition. He had been selected by the American committee to represent American painting, over Albert Bierstadt whose majestic, large-scale landscapes peopled with tiny figures of pioneers and Indians were by then considered passé.Around this time, Remington made a gentleman&#x27;s agreement with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, giving the magazine an informal first option on his output but maintaining Remington&#x27;s independence to sell elsewhere if desired. As a bonus, the magazine launched a massive promotional campaign for Remington, stating that &quot;He draws what he knows, and he knows what he draws.&quot; Though laced with blatant puffery (common for the time) claiming that Remington was a bona fide cowboy and Indian scout, the effect of the campaign was to raise Remington to the equal of the era&#x27;s top illustrators, Howard Pyle and Charles Dana Gibson.

His first one-man show, in 1890, presented twenty-one paintings at the American Art Galleries and was very well received. With success all but assured, Remington became established in society. His personality, his &quot;pseudo-cowboy&quot; speaking manner, and his &quot;Wild West&quot; reputation were strong social attractions. His biography falsely promoted some of the myths he encouraged about his Western experiences.

Remington&#x27;s regular attendance at celebrity banquets and stag dinners, however, though helpful to his career, fostered prodigious eating and drinking which caused his girth to expand alarmingly. Obesity became a constant problem for him from then on. Among his urban friends and fellow artists, he was &quot;a man among men, a deuce of a good fellow&quot; but notable because he (facetiously) &quot;never drew but two women in his life, and they were failures&quot; (this estimation failed to account for his female Native American subjects).
In 1890, Remington and his wife moved to New Rochelle, New York, to have both more living space and extensive studio facilities, and also with the hope of gaining more exercise. The community was close to New York City affording easy access to the publishing houses and galleries necessary for the artist, and also rural enough to provide him with the space he needed for horseback riding, and other physical activities that relieved the long hours of concentration required by his work. Moreover, an artists&#x27; colony had developed in the town, so that the Remingtons counted among their neighbors writers, actors, and artists such as Francis Wilson, Julian Hawthorne, Edward Kemble, and Augustus Thomas.

The Remingtons&#x27; substantial Gothic revival house was situated at 301 Webster Avenue, on a prestigious promontory known as Lathers Hill. A sweeping lawn rolled south toward Long Island Sound, providing views on three sides of the beautiful Westchester County countryside. Remington called it &quot;Endion&quot;, an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;the place where I live&quot;. In the early years, no real studio existed at Endion and Remington did most of his work in a large attic under the home&#x27;s front gable where he stored materials collected on his many western excursions. Later he used his library on the main floor, a larger, more comfortable room that soon took on the cluttered appearance of an atelier. However, neither situation was completely satisfactory: the space was limited, the light was less than adequate, and the surroundings were generally uninspiring. In the spring of 1896 Remington retained the New Rochelle architect O. William Degen to plan a studio addition to the house. An article in the &quot;New Rochelle Pioneer&quot; of April 26 touted the &quot;fine architectural design&quot; of the studio. Remington himself wrote to his friend the novelist Owen Wister:

Have concluded to build a butler&#x27;s pantry and a studio (Czar size) on my house—we will be torn [up] for a month and then will ask you to come over—throw your eye on the march of improvement and say this is a great thing for American art. The fireplace is going to be like this.—Old Norman house—Big—big.

== Later career ==
=== Further travels ===
Remington&#x27;s fame made him a favorite of the Western Army officers fighting the last Native American battles. He was invited out West to make their portraits in the field and to gain them national publicity through Remington&#x27;s articles and illustrations for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, particularly General Nelson Miles, an Indian fighter who aspired to the presidency of the United States. In turn, Remington got exclusive access to the soldiers and their stories and boosted his reputation with the reading public as &quot;The Soldier Artist&quot;. One of his 1889 paintings depicts eight cavalrymen shooting at Apaches in the rear as they attempt to outrun the Indians. Another painting that year depicts cavalrymen in an Arizona sandstorm. Remington wrote that the &quot;heat was awful and the dust rose in clouds. Men get sulky and go into a comatose state – the fine alkali dust penetrates everything but the canteens.&quot;
Remington arrived on the scene just after the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, in which 150 Sioux, mostly women and children, were killed. He reported the event as &quot;The Sioux Outbreak in South Dakota&quot;, having hailed the Army&#x27;s &quot;heroic&quot; actions toward the Indians. Some of the Miles paintings are monochromatic and have an almost &quot;you-are-there&quot; photographic quality, heightening the realism, as in &quot;The Parley&quot; (1898).

Remington&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait on a Horse&quot; (1890) shows the artist as he had wished, not the pot-bellied Easterner weighing heavily on a horse, but a tough, lean cowboy heading for adventure with his trusty steed. It was the image his publishers worked hard to maintain as well.
In &quot;His Last Stand&quot; (1890), a cornered bear in the middle of a prairie is brought down by dogs and riflemen, which may have been a symbolized treatment of the dying Indians he had witnessed. Remington&#x27;s attitude toward Native Americans was typical for the time. He thought them unfathomable, fearless, superstitious, ignorant and pitiless, and generally portrayed them as such. White men under attack were brave and noble.

Through the 1890s, Remington took frequent trips around the US, Mexico, and abroad to gather ideas for articles and illustrations, but his military and cowboy subjects always sold the best, even as the Old West was playing out. In 1892, he painted &quot;A Cavalryman&#x27;s Breakfast on the Plains&quot;. In 1895 Remington headed south and his illustrations and article on the &quot;Florida crackers&quot; (cowboys) were published by Harper&#x27;s magazine. Gradually, he transitioned from the premiere chronicler-artist of the Old West to its most important historian-artist. He formed an effective partnership with Owen Wister, who became the leading writer of Western stories at the time. Having more confidence of his craft, Remington wrote, &quot;My drawing is done entirely from memory. I never use a camera now. The interesting never occurs in nature as a whole, but in pieces. It&#x27;s more what I leave out than what I add.&quot; Remington&#x27;s focus continued on outdoor action and he rarely depicted scenes in gambling and dance halls typically seen in Western movies. He avoided frontier women as well. His painting &quot;A Misdeal&quot; (1897) is a rare instance of indoor cowboy violence.Remington had developed a sculptor&#x27;s 360-degree sense of vision but until a chance remark by playwright Augustus Thomas in 1895, Remington had not yet conceived of himself as a sculptor and thought of it as a separate art for which he had no training or aptitude. With help from friend and sculptor Frederick Ruckstull, Remington constructed his first armature and clay model, a &quot;broncho buster&quot; on a horse that was rearing on its hind legs—technically a very challenging subject. After several months, the novice sculptor overcame the difficulties and had a plaster cast made, then bronze copies, which were sold at Tiffany&#x27;s. Remington was ecstatic about his new line of work, and though critical response was mixed, some labelling it negatively as &quot;illustrated sculpture&quot;, it was a successful first effort earning him $6,000 over three years.

During that busy year, Remington became further immersed in military matters, inventing a new type of ammunition carrier; but his patented invention was not accepted for use by the War Department. His favorite subject for magazine illustration was now military scenes, though he admitted, &quot;Cowboys are cash with me&quot;. Sensing the political mood of that time, he was looking forward to a military conflict which would provide the opportunity to be a heroic war correspondent, giving him both new subject matter and the excitement of battle. He was growing bored with routine illustration, and he wrote to Howard Pyle, the dean of American illustrators, that he had &quot;done nothing but potboil of late&quot;. (Earlier, he and Pyle, in a gesture of mutual respect, had exchanged paintings: Pyle&#x27;s painting of a dead pirate for Remington&#x27;s of a rough and ready cowpuncher). He was still working very hard and spending seven days a week in his studio.

Remington was further irritated by the lack of his acceptance to regular membership by the Academy, likely because of his image as a popular, cocky, and ostentatious artist. Remington kept up his contact with celebrities and politicos, and continued to woo Theodore Roosevelt, now the New York City Police Commissioner, by sending him complimentary editions of new works. Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s great admiration for Remington, he never purchased a Remington painting or drawing.


=== In Cuba ===
Remington&#x27;s association with Roosevelt paid off, however, when the artist was hired as a war correspondent and illustrator for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot; in January 1897. Remington was sent down to Cuba in company with celebrity journalist Richard Harding Davis, another friend and supporter of Roosevelt. Cuba&#x27;s apparent peacefulness left them nothing to report on. That led to this famous but probably apocryphal exchange of telegrams between Remington and Hearst:

:&quot;Everything is quiet. There is no trouble. There will be no war. I wish to return.&quot;

:&quot;Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I&#x27;ll furnish the war.&quot; 

Remington did return to New Rochelle while Davis remained until February, when he booked return passage on the P&amp;O steamer &quot;Olivette&quot;. Aboard the ship, he met Clemencia Arango, who said her brother was a colonel in the insurgence, that she had been deported for her revolutionary activities, and that she had been stripsearched by the Spanish officials before boarding. Shocked by her story, Davis dispatched this news from Tampa to Hearst on the 10th. The front page of the &quot;Journal&quot; for the 12th was dominated by Remington&#x27;s sensationalist illustration, run across five columns of newsprint, of Arango stripped naked on the ship&#x27;s deck, in public, surrounded by four male Spanish officials. Hearst deemed it the &quot;Olivette Incident&quot;. The issue sold a record number of copies, almost a million, partly on the strength of Remington&#x27;s image of a naked humiliated female resistance fighter. The next day Arango called Remington&#x27;s version largely a fabrication.

Two days later, on the 15th, the USS &quot;Maine&quot; exploded. As the Spanish–American War took shape into April, the artist returned to Cuba to see military action for the first time. It was the &quot;most wrenching, disillusioning experience of Remington&#x27;s life.&quot; As he witnessed the assault on San Juan Hill by American forces, including those led by Roosevelt, his heroic conception of war was shattered by the actual horror of jungle fighting and the deprivations he faced in camp. His reports and illustrations upon his return focused not on heroic generals but also on the troops, as in his &quot;Scream of the Shrapnel&quot; (1899), which depicts a deadly ambush on American troops by an unseen enemy.

When the Rough Riders returned to the US, they presented their courageous leader Roosevelt with Remington&#x27;s bronze statuette, &quot;The Bronco Buster&quot;, which the artist proclaimed, &quot;the greatest compliment I ever had... After this everything will be mere fuss.&quot; Roosevelt responded, &quot;There could have been no more appropriate gift from such a regiment.&quot;

=== After 1900 ===
In 1898, he achieved the public honor of having two paintings used for reproduction on US Postal stamps. In 1900, Remington purchased an island on the U.S. side of the St. Lawrence River that he called Ingleneuk, which he used as a summer residence.

:“It is given to few men to live Crusoe-like on an island all their own; but Remington besides possessing his own island has augmented the boon with a substantial cottage, studio and outbuildings and lives part from the herding crowd like a feudal lord of old. You cannot possibly disturb him at his work; you could not even located this ‘Ingleneuk’ unless piloted to it. There are only five acres of it, but it is an impregnable stronghold and is, as the artist himself describes it, ‘the finest place on earth…’ Here Remington works all summer… I asked him for a photograph of the house at ‘Ingleneuk.’ ‘Bless your soul,’ he replied, ‘it couldn’t be photographed at any angle; it is solidly screen from view on all sides by the densest growth of trees along the St. Lawrence.’” (reporter Perriton Maxwell in the October 1907 issue of &quot;Pearson’s Magazine&quot;)

In 1900, as an economy move, Harper&#x27;s dropped Remington as their star artist. To compensate for the loss of work, Remington wrote and illustrated a full-length novel, &quot;The Way of an Indian&quot;, which was intended for serialization by a Hearst publication but was not published until five years later in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. Remington&#x27;s protagonist, a Cheyenne named Fire Eater, is a prototype Native American as viewed by Remington and many of his time.

Remington then returned to sculpture and produced his first works produced by the lost wax method, a higher-quality process than the earlier sand casting method, which he had employed. By 1901, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; was buying Remington&#x27;s illustrations on a steady basis. As his style matured, Remington portrayed his subjects in every light of day. His nocturnal paintings, very popular in his late life, such as &quot;A Taint on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Scare in the Pack Train&quot; and &quot;Fired On&quot;, are more impressionistic and loosely painted and focus on an unseen threat.

Remington completed another novel in 1902, &quot;John Ermine of the Yellowstone&quot;, a modest success but a definite disappointment as it was completely overshadowed by the bestseller &quot;The Virginian&quot;, written by his sometime collaborator Owen Wister, which became a classic Western novel. A stage play based on &quot;John Ermine&quot; failed in 1904. After &quot;John Ermine&quot;, Remington decided he would soon quit writing and illustrating (he had drawn over 2700 illustrations) to focus on sculpture and painting.

In 1903, Remington painted &quot;His First Lesson&quot;, set on an American-owned ranch in Chihuahua, Mexico. The hands wear heavy chaps, starched white shirts, and slouch-brimmed hats. In his paintings, Remington sought to let his audience &quot;take away something to think about – to imagine.&quot; In 1905, Remington had a major publicity coup when &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; devoted an entire issue to the artist, showcasing his latest works. It was that same year that the president of the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) commissioned Remington to create a large sculpture of a cowboy for Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairmount Park, which was erected in 1908 on a jutting rock along Kelly Drive, a site that Remington had specifically chosen for the piece after he had a horseman pose for him in the exact location. Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy&quot; (1908) was Remington&#x27;s first and only large-scale bronze, and the sculpture is one of the earliest examples of site-specific art in the United States.

Remington&#x27;s &quot;Explorers&quot; series, depicting older historical events in Western US history, did not fare well with the public or the critics. The financial panic of 1907 caused a slow down in his sales and in 1908, fantasy artists, such as Maxfield Parrish, became popular with the public and with commercial sponsors. Remington tried to sell his home in New Rochelle to get further away from urbanization. One night, he made a bonfire in his yard and burned dozens of his oil paintings that had been used for magazine illustration (worth millions of dollars today) to make an emphatic statement that he was done with illustration forever. He wrote that &quot;there is nothing left but my landscape studies.&quot;

Near the end of his life, he moved to Ridgefield, Connecticut. In his final two years, under the influence of The Ten, he was veering more heavily to Impressionism, and he regretted that he was studio bound (by virtue of his declining health) and could not follow his peers, who painted &quot;plein air&quot;.

Remington died after an emergency appendectomy led to peritonitis on December 26, 1909. His extreme obesity (of nearly 300 lbs = 136,1 kgs) had complicated the anesthesia and the surgery, and chronic appendicitis was cited in the postmortem examination as an underlying factor in his death.

After Remington&#x27;s death, his wife, Eva, moved to a home in Ogdensburg, NY (her hometown), which was made possible through the generosity of George Hall, an Ogdensburg industrialist, and John Howard, a friend of the Remingtons. Eva lived there with her sister, Emma, from 1915 to her death in 1918. While there, Eva managed Remington&#x27;s copyrights and production of sculptures. She also worked to establish a permanent memorial to her husband, which became a reality after her death when the Remington Art Memorial was established in her Ogdensburg home in 1923 -- today, the Frederic Remington Art Museum.

The Frederic Remington House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. He was the great-uncle of the artist Deborah Remington. In 2009, the United States Congress enacted legislation renaming the historic Post Office in Ogdensburg, New York, the Frederic Remington Post Office Building.

== Style and influence ==

Remington was the most successful Western illustrator in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of illustration at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, so much so that the other Western artists such as Charles Russell and Charles Schreyvogel were known during Remington&#x27;s life as members of the &quot;School of Remington&quot;. His style was naturalistic, sometimes impressionistic, and usually veered away from the ethnographic realism of earlier Western artists such as George Catlin. His focus was firmly on the people and animals of the West, portraying men almost exclusively, and the landscape was usually of secondary importance, unlike the members and descendants of the contemporary Hudson River School, such as Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Moran, who glorified the vastness of the West and the dominance of nature over man. He took artistic liberties in his depictions of human action, also for the sake of his readers&#x27; and publishers&#x27; interest. Though always confident in his subject matter, Remington was less sure about his colors, and critics often harped on his palette, but his lack of confidence drove him to experiment and produce a great variety of effects, some very true to nature and some imagined.

His collaboration with Owen Wister on &quot;The Evolution of the Cowpuncher&quot;, published by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; in September 1893, was the first statement of the mythical cowboy in American literature, spawning the entire genre of Western fiction, films, and theater that followed. Remington provided the concept of the project, its factual content, and its illustrations and Wister supplied the stories, sometimes altering Remington&#x27;s ideas. (Remington&#x27;s prototype cowboys were Mexican rancheros but Wister made the American cowboys descendants of Saxons. In truth, they were both partially right, as the first American cowboys were both the ranchers who tended the cattle and horses of the American Revolutionary Army on Long Island and the Mexicans who ranched in the Arizona and California territories.)
Remington was one of the first American artists to illustrate the true gait of the horse in motion (along with Thomas Eakins), as validated by the famous sequential photographs of Eadweard Muybridge. Previously, horses in full gallop were usually depicted with all four legs pointing out, like &quot;hobby horses&quot;. The galloping horse became Remington&#x27;s signature subject, which was copied and interpreted by many Western artists who followed him to adopt the correct anatomical motion. Though criticized by some for his use of photography, Remington often created depictions that slightly exaggerated natural motion to satisfy the eye. He wrote that &quot;the artist must know more than the camera... (the horse must be) incorrectly drawn from the photographic standpoint (to achieve the desired effect).&quot;

Also, noteworthy was Remington&#x27;s invention of &quot;cowboy&quot; sculpture. From his inaugural piece, &quot;The Broncho Buster&quot; (1895), he created an art form which is still very popular among collectors of Western art. He has been called the &quot;Father of Cowboy Sculpture&quot;.

An early advocate of the photoengraving process over wood engraving for magazine reproduction of illustrative art, Remington became an accepted expert in reproduction methods, which helped gain him strong working relationships with editors and printers. Furthermore, Remington&#x27;s skill as a businessman was equal to his artistry, unlike many other artists who relied on their spouses or business agents or no one at all to run their financial affairs. He was an effective publicist and promoter of his art. He insisted for his originals to be handled carefully and returned to him in pristine condition (without editor&#x27;s marks) so that he could sell them. He carefully regulated his output to maximize his income and kept detailed notes about his works and his sales. In 1991, the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot; filmed a documentary of Remington&#x27;s life, &quot;Frederic Remington: The Truth of Other Days&quot;, which was produced and directed by Tom Neff.

Remington was portrayed by Nick Chinlund in the TNT miniseries &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (1997), which depicts the Spanish–American War and shows Remington&#x27;s time as a war correspondent and his partnership with William Randolph Hearst (portrayed by George Hamilton).

<doc id="420747" wikidata="Q309715" url="?curid=420747" title="Roland Joffé">
<text>Roland Joffé (; born 17 November 1945) is an English film and television director, producer and screenwriter. He is known for directing the critically-acclaimed films &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), both of which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and the latter winning the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.

Joffé began his career in television, his early credits including episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and an adaptation of &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; for Granada. He gained a reputation for hard-hitting political stories with the series &quot;Bill Brand&quot; and factual dramas for &quot;Play for Today&quot;. In the late 1980s, he co-founded the production company Lightmotive with Ben Myron.

==Early life and education==
Joffé was born in London to a family of French and Jewish origin. Around 1950, Roland&#x27;s father Mark Joffé began a relationship with the daughter of Jacob Epstein and Kathleen Garman, Esther Garman, who helped raise Roland. After Esther&#x27;s suicide in 1954, Roland lived with her parents. Portraits of Roland as a child by Jacob Epstein and Esther&#x27;s brother Theodore Garman are part of the Garman Ryan Collection at The New Art Gallery Walsall.

Joffé was educated at two independent schools: the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in London, and Carmel College in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, which was Europe&#x27;s only Jewish boarding school, until it closed in 1997. He completed his formal education at the University of Manchester.

==Career==
===TV director===
After university, Joffé joined Granada Television as a trainee director in 1973, where he directed episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Sam&quot;, &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot;, &quot;Crown Court&quot;, &quot;Bill Brand&quot;, and &quot;Headmaster&quot;.

In 1977, producer Tony Garnett was commissioned by the BBC to direct the play &quot;The Spongers&quot; within BBCs &quot;Play for Today&quot; series. He informed the BBC drama department that he wanted to hire Roland Joffé as director, but was told that Joffé did not possess BBC clearance and was regarded a &quot;security risk&quot; (see: &quot;Christmas tree&quot; list). The reason was that Joffé had attended some Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party meetings in the early 1970s, although he never became a party member. He explained around 1988: &quot;I was very interested in politics at that time. But I was interested in what all the political parties were doing, not just the WRP, and I was never actively involved.&quot; Only after Garnett threatened he would &quot;go public&quot;, was the veto on Joffé&#x27;s appointment withdrawn. &quot;The Spongers&quot; won the prestigious Prix Italia award.

Joffé also directed an episode in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Second City Firsts&quot; in 1977 and later directed two more plays for &quot;Play for Today&quot;: &quot;The Legion Hall Bombing&quot; (1979) and &quot;United Kingdom&quot; (1981). In 1979, he directed the TV play &quot;No, Mama, No&quot; by Verity Bargate for the &quot;ITV Playhouse&quot; series, and in 1980 he made a version of 17th century dramatist John Ford&#x27;s play &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; as a TV film for the BBC.

===Film director===
Roland Joffé&#x27;s first two feature films (&quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, 1984, and &quot;The Mission&quot;, 1986) each garnered him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Joffé worked closely with producer David Puttnam on each film. &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; detailed the friendship of two men, an American journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and his translator, a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge in Communist Cambodia. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing) and was nominated for four more (including Best Picture and Best Director). &quot;The Mission&quot; was a story of conflict between Jesuit missionaries in South America, who were trying to convert the Guaraní Indians, and the Portuguese and Spanish colonisers, who wanted to enslave the natives. In an interview with Thomas Bird, Joffé says of &quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;The Indians are innocent. The film is about what happens in the world... what that innocence brings out in us. You would sit in a cinema in New York, or in Tokyo, or Paris, and for that point of time you would be joined with your companions on this planet. You would come out with a real sense of a network.&quot;. The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or and Technical Grand Jury Prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. It achieved six Academy Awards nominations—including for Best Picture, Best Director, and Ennio Morricone&#x27;s acclaimed Best Original Score—and won one, for Best Cinematography.

In 1993, he produced and partially directed a big budget adaptation of the video game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;. The film struggled to make back its budget. His 1995 adaptation of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; was a critical and financial disaster, and his 2007 horror film &quot;Captivity&quot; drew controversy with its advertising billboards, widely regarded as exploitative and misogynistic . He received Razzie Nominations for Worst Director for &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;Captivity&quot;.

His 2011 release, &quot;There Be Dragons&quot;, garnered press attention as it dealt with the Catholic organisation Opus Dei. A movie about faith and forgiveness, &quot;There Be Dragons&quot; is a project that Joffé says has a message he&#x27;s proud to say on film. In an interview with CBN.com, he stated, &quot;I have a very deep emotional investment in this film. I feel that I really want to stand behind what it says to us as human beings.&quot;

In 2013 Joffé directed the internationally co-produced historical epic romance time travel adventure film, &quot;The Lovers&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1974 to 1980, Joffé was married to actress Jane Lapotaire; they have a son, screenwriter and director Rowan Joffé (b. 1973). Later, he and actress Cherie Lunghi were in a longterm relationship; they have a daughter, actor Nathalie Lunghi (b. 1986).

Joffé is a board member of the nonprofit organization Operation USA. He was the official patron of the 2011 Cambodia Volleyball World Cup held from 23 to 29 July at the National Olympic Stadium Phnom Penh. Roland Joffé lives on the island of Malta and is an active member of the team organising the Valletta Film Festival.

Religiously, Joffé has described himself as a &quot;wobbly agnostic&quot;.

<doc id="420752" wikidata="Q7550492" url="?curid=420752" title="Social Credit Party (New Zealand)">
<text>The New Zealand Social Credit Party (sometimes called &quot;Socred&quot;) was a political party that was New Zealand&#x27;s third party from the 1950s to the 1980s. It won representation in the New Zealand House of Representatives, holding one seat at times between 1966 and 1981, and two seats from 1981 to 1987. While Social Credit once had significant support, particularly as a protest vote, it was disadvantaged by first-past-the-post voting as it had no geographically concentrated vote. Its most identifiable leaders were Vernon Cracknell (1963-70), who served just one term in parliament, and the household name Bruce Beetham, who rebuilt the party into a significant political force. At its zenith under Beetham in 1981, Social Credit achieved 20.7% of the vote.

The party held no seats in its own right after 1987 and subsequently declined. It was named the New Zealand Democratic Party from 1985 to 2018, and was part of the Alliance from 1991 to 2002. The party returned to the Social Credit name in 2018. The Social Credit Party and its logo were deregistered at the party&#x27;s request on 28 February 2023, following the death of its leader Chris Leitch earlier that year.

The party was based on the ideas of social credit, an economic theory established by C. H. Douglas. Social credit movements also existed in Australia (Douglas Credit Party and Australian League of Rights), Canada (Social Credit Party of Canada), and the United Kingdom (UK Social Credit Party) although the relationship between those movements and the New Zealand movement was not always amicable. The party was also intermittently damaged from allegations of antisemitism, stemming from Douglas&#x27; own racist views. Beetham formally denounced antisemitism upon his election.

==History==
===The Social Credit Association===
The Social Credit Political League was formed in 1953 out of the membership of the Social Credit Association, an educational organisation. The association focused much of its efforts on the Country Party and New Zealand Labour Party, where it attempted to influence economic policy.

The social credit movement decided to set up a &quot;separate political organisation&quot; the Real Democracy Movement in 1942. RDM got about 4,400 votes in the . Roly Marks had stood as a monetary reform candidate on behalf of the Real Democracy Movement in the Wanganui electorate in 1943, and was later made a life member of the League.

Maurice Hayes stood for the electorate on behalf of the &quot;Social Credit Association&quot; in the , receiving 374 votes and coming third.

Social Credit claimed that the first Labour government, which was elected at the 1935 election, pulled New Zealand out of the Great Depression by adopting certain Social Credit policies. Several followers of Social Credit policies eventually left the Labour Party, where their proposals (for example, those of John A. Lee for housing) were strongly opposed by the &quot;orthodox&quot; Minister of Finance, Walter Nash and other prominent Labour Party members.

In 1940 Lee, who had by then been expelled from the Labour Party, and Bill Barnard formed the Democratic Labour Party. The new party got 4.3% of the vote in the 1943 general election, with both Lee and Barnard losing their seats.

===Foundation===

The Social Credit Party was established as the Social Credit Political League. It was founded on 10 January 1953, and grew out of the earlier Social Credit Association.

The party&#x27;s first leader was Wilfrid Owen, a businessman. Much of the early activity in the party involved formulating policy and promoting social credit theories to the public.

===Early history (1953–1972)===

Social Credit gained support quickly, and in the 1954 elections, the party won 11.13% of the vote. The party failed to win seats in parliament under the first past the post electoral system. The party&#x27;s quick rise did, however, prompt discussion of the party&#x27;s policies. National saw Social Credit as a threat in the 1957 election and established a caucus committee to challenge their theories. Gustafson comments that the successes in some seats (Hobson, Rangitikei, East Coast Bays and Pakuranga) came from a &quot;peculiar and infrequent combination of factors&quot;, with votes in those seats coming from &quot;a handful of committed monetary reformers plus alienated National voters and the tactical voting of Labour supporters in a seat where Labour could not win&quot;.

In 1960 P. H. Matthews replaced Owen as leader, before being replaced three years later by Vernon Cracknell, an accountant. It was not until the 1966 election, however, that the party won its first representation in parliament. Cracknell managed to win the Hobson electorate in Northland in 1966, a region that had been a stronghold of the Country Party. Cracknell narrowly defeated the National Party&#x27;s Logan Sloane, the incumbent, after having placed second in the previous two elections.

Cracknell did not prove to be a good performer in parliament itself, however, and did not succeed in advancing the Social Credit manifesto. Partly due to this, and partly due to an exceptionally poor campaign, Cracknell was not re-elected in the 1969 election, returning Sloane to parliament and depriving Social Credit of its only seat.

The following year, a leadership contest between Cracknell and another prominent Social Credit member, John O&#x27;Brien, ended in disaster, with brawling between supporters of each candidate. The damage done to the party&#x27;s image was considerable. O&#x27;Brien was eventually victorious, but his blunt and confrontational style caused him to lose his position after only a short time in office. He split from Social Credit to found his own New Democratic Party.

===Popularity zenith (1972–1985)===

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s replacement was Bruce Beetham, who would become the most well known Social Credit leader. Beetham took over in time for the 1972 election. Despite a relatively strong showing, Social Credit failed to win any seats, a fact that some blamed on the rise of the new Values Party. While the Values Party did not win any seats, many supporters of Social Credit believed that it drew voters away from the older party.

In the 1978 by-election in Rangitikei, caused by the death of National Party MP Roy Jack, Beetham managed to defeat National&#x27;s replacement candidate and win the seat. Beetham was more successful in parliament than Cracknell had been, and gained Social Credit considerable attention. He also put forward a New Zealand Credit and Currency Bill, intended to implement many Social Credit policies. The Bill was criticised by some of the more extreme Social Credit supporters, who claimed that it was too weak, but was nevertheless strongly promoted in parliament by Beetham. The Bill quickly failed, although this was not particularly unexpected – it had been put forward primarily for the purpose of drawing attention, not because Beetham believed it would succeed.

Beetham retained his seat in the 1978 general election. He was later joined by Gary Knapp, who defeated free-market National Party candidate Don Brash in the 1980 by-election in East Coast Bays (caused by the resignation of the sitting National MP). Knapp, like Beetham, was highly active in parliament.

Led by Beetham and Knapp, Social Credit became a popular alternative to the two major parties. Political scientists debate how much of this was due to Social Credit policies and how much was merely a &quot;protest vote&quot; against the established parties, but one poll recorded Social Credit with as much as 30% of the vote.

By the 1981 election, the party&#x27;s support had subsided somewhat, and Social Credit gained 20.55% of the vote. As expected, the electoral system did not translate this into seats in parliament, but Social Credit did retain the two seats it already held. A year later, it officially dropped &quot;Political League&quot; from its official name, becoming merely the Social Credit Party.

During that parliamentary term, Social Credit&#x27;s support was damaged by a deal between Beetham and National Party Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. In exchange for Social Credit support for the Clyde Dam, a controversial construction project and part of &quot;Think Big&quot;, Muldoon undertook to back certain Social Credit proposals. This did considerable harm to Social Credit&#x27;s popularity, as Muldoon&#x27;s government (and the project itself) were opposed by most Social Credit members. To make matters worse, Muldoon did not deliver on many of his pledges, depriving Social Credit of any significant victories with which to mitigate its earlier setback.

In 1983, Beetham suffered a minor heart attack, causing him to lose some of his earlier energy. He also became, according to many Social Credit supporters, more demanding and intolerant. This reduced Social Credit&#x27;s appeal to voters.

In the 1984 election, Beetham lost his Rangitikei seat to a National Party challenger, Denis Marshall. Knapp retained his East Coast Bays seat, and another Social Credit candidate, Neil Morrison, won Pakuranga. Despite still holding the same number of seats, Social Credit won 7.6% of the total vote in 1984, a substantial drop. Some commentators attributed this to the New Zealand Party, an economically right-wing liberal party that opposed Muldoon&#x27;s government. The New Zealand Party may have taken some of the protest votes that Social Credit once received. It was from this election that the term &quot;Crimplene Suit and Skoda Brigade&quot; was coined for Social Credit (by defeated National Party Pakuranga MP Pat Hunt).

===Democrats (1985–1991)===

At the party&#x27;s 1985 conference, the Social Credit name was dropped, and group became the New Zealand Democratic Party (Beetham had earlier argued for a simpler name in 1982). At the 1987 election, the party held two seats in parliament (one was East Coast Bays, held by Garry Knapp; and the other was Pakuranga, held by Neil Morrison). The Democratic Party lost both those seats, removing them from parliament. In 1988, Knapp and a group of other Democrats were involved in a protest at parliament to highlight the Labour government&#x27;s abandonment on its election promise to hold a referendum on the first-past-the-post electoral system.

The Social Credit name did not vanish immediately, however. In 1986, the year after the party was renamed, Bruce Beetham was removed from the leadership of the Democrats and replaced by Neil Morrison. The Democrats saw their vote slump in 1987 and both its MPs were defeated. By 1990 the party&#x27;s vote collapsed altogether by which time they had been eclipsed by other third party choices such as the Greens and NewLabour. It is believed that changing the name of the party was a historic mistake and a major cause in the subsequent decline of support.

Beetham was extremely bitter about the Democrats&#x27; change of direction, and led a short-lived splinter group called Social Credit-NZ, using the Social Credit label. It failed to win any seats in 1990 and quickly vanished.

===Alliance years (1991–2002)===

The Democrats, finding themselves increasingly pressured by the growth of NewLabour (founded by rebel Labour Party MP Jim Anderton) and the Greens, decided to increase cooperation with compatible parties. This resulted in the Democrats joining NewLabour, the Greens and Māori-based party Mana Motuhake in forming the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition group.

In the 1996 election, which was conducted under the new mixed-member proportional representation electoral system, the Alliance won thirteen seats. Among the MPs elected were John Wright and Grant Gillon, both members of the Democratic Party. However, there was considerable dissatisfaction in the Democratic Party over the Alliance&#x27;s course. Many Democrats believed that their views were not being incorporated into Alliance party policy, particularly as regards the core economic doctrine of social credit. The Alliance tended towards orthodox taxation based left-wing economics and was not prepared to implement the Democratic Party&#x27;s somewhat unusual economic theories.

By the 1999 election, the Democrats were one of two remaining component parties in the Alliance as the Greens had left the grouping and the Liberals and NewLabour components dissolved, their members becoming members of the Alliance as a whole rather than of any specific constituent party.

===Progressive Coalition and independent again (2002–present)===

In 2002, when tensions between the &quot;moderate left&quot; and the &quot;hard left&quot; caused a split in the Alliance, the Democrats followed Jim Anderton&#x27;s moderate faction and became a part of the Progressive Coalition. In the 2002 election, Grant Gillon and John Wright were placed third and fourth on the party&#x27;s list. However, the Progressives won only enough votes for two seats, thus leaving the two Democrats outside parliament.

Shortly after the election, the Democrats split from the Progressives, re-establishing themselves as an independent party. However, Gillon and Wright, both of whom opposed the split, chose not to follow the Democrats, instead remaining with the Progressives. The Progressive Coalition became the Progressive Party after the Democrats left. The Democrats chose Stephnie de Ruyter, who had been fifth on the Progressive list, as their new leader.

In 2005, the party re-added &quot;for Social Credit&quot; to its name to supplement its party name. The Democrats contested that year&#x27;s general election as an independent party and received 0.05% of the party vote. In the 2008 general election, the party again won 0.05% of the party vote.

The party did not apply for broadcasting funding for the 2011 election. During the election, it won 1,432 votes and was the only party to not attract a party vote in an electorate (Mangere). The party fielded thirty electorate candidates and four list only candidates in the 2014 general election but continued to fail to gain any seats in the 51st New Zealand Parliament.

During the 2017 general election, the Democrats for Social Credit ran 26 candidates, namely 13 electorate candidates and 13 list only candidates. The party gained 806 votes on the party vote (0.0%) and failed to win any seats in Parliament.

In June 2018, the party voted to change its name back to Social Credit after Chris Leitch was elected leader.

During the 2020 general election, Social Credit won no seats, obtaining 1,520 votes (0.05%). In 2021 the party opposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

The party&#x27;s registration was cancelled at its own request on 28 February 2023. Leitch died in January 2023 which left &quot;a really big hole&quot; in the party organisation according to party president Gloria Bruni. The party requested deregistration due to membership having dipped below 500 but will still remain active despite being deregistered and being unable to submit a party list at the 2023 general election. Bruni stated that the party intends to rebrand to avoid comparison with the controversial social credit system used by the Chinese Communist Party.
== Accusations of antisemitism (1934–1984) ==

During the 20th century, the social credit movement in New Zealand was accused of indulging in antisemitic conspiracy theories. C. H. Douglas, the founder of the social credit movement, toured New Zealand in 1934 and expounded his view that Jews were involved in a global conspiracy to control finance. His ideas were discussed in the New Zealand Social Credit publication &quot;Plain Talk&quot;. Social Credit, along with the Department of Internal Affairs, published &quot;From Europe to New Zealand: An Account of Our Continental European Settlers&quot; by Eric Butler and R.A Lochore, which repeated Jewish financial conspiracy claims. In the 1980 East Coast Bays by-election, the Labour Party attempted to discredit Social Credit with a pamphlet that set out Major Douglas’s antisemitic views.

The encyclopedia &quot;Te Ara&quot; states that the antisemitism of Social Credit ended in the 1970s with the election of leader Bruce Beetham who was more liberal. In the late 1970s the party became concerned about infiltration by the anti-semitic League of Rights and ejected members with racist views. Professor Paul Spooney stated that antisemitic sentiment was &quot;largely irrelevant&quot; by the 1970s, but remained present until 1984 when Beetham ejected party members who believed in an international financial Jewish conspiracy.

<text>Law 3037/2002 was a controversial law passed by the Greek government in 2002 and was later repealed in 2011. The law effectively banned all electronic games in public places in the hopes that it would fight illegal gambling in the country. The bill was formulated after a member of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) political party was videotaped in an illegal gambling establishment, resulting in public hysteria that was fueled by sensationalist reporting in the press. The bill was passed on 29 July 2002 to take effect with its publication in the Government Gazette, pursuant to the enabling article.

During a case against some Internet café owners who allowed their customers to play online chess and other games, a local court in Thessaloniki declared the law unconstitutional. More than 300 people gathered outside the court in support of the Internet café owners. The law affected both Greek citizens and foreigners. The European Commission sent an official letter to the Greek Foreign Ministry explaining that the law may be in conflict with European legislation and, if that were the case, action could be taken against Greece by the European Court of Justice.

On September 24, 2002, government officials published a document in an effort to clarify the controversial articles of the law. After the European Union intervention and debates Internet café owners, the government passed a new decision (1107414/1491/T. &amp; E. F.), published in the Government Gazette issue 1827, on December 8, 2003. The new law clarified some articles of 3037/2002 but still banned video games in internet cafés and computer software which deleted or encrypted files on hard disks of computers owned by Internet cafés. The Greek police raided Internet cafes in Larissa on January 14, 2004, as reported by &quot;Eleftherotypia&quot; newspaper. Eighty computers were taken by the police as evidence, and three Internet café owners were arrested. The European Commission in February 2005 referred Greece to the European Court of Justice over its ban on electronic games.

The law 3037/2002 was repealed in 2011, by the article 54 of law 4002/2011 ΦΕΚ Α/180/22-8-2011.

<text>Caphtor ( &quot;Kaftōr&quot;) is a locality mentioned in the Bible, in which its people are called Caphtorites or Caphtorim and are named as a division of the ancient Egyptians. Caphtor is also mentioned in ancient inscriptions from Egypt, Mari, and Ugarit.

According to the Bible, Caphtor is the original homeland of the Philistines. They are reported to have eradicated the Avvim prior to settling in Gaza. Genealogically, the Philistines are categorized as descendants of the Caphtorites within the table of nations. The Book of Jeremiah suggests that Caphtor is an island (&quot;the isle of Caphtor&quot;), but the term might alternatively refer to a seashore.

Traditionally, Caphtor has been linked to Crete and associated with Egyptian &quot;Keftiu&quot; or Akkadian &quot;Kaptara&quot;. Jewish sources placed Caphtor in the region of Pelusium. Contemporary research has challenged the link with Crete, proposing alternative locations such as Cyprus or Cilicia.

==Jewish accounts==
The Caphtorites are mentioned in the Table of Nations, Book of Genesis () as one of several divisions of Mizraim (Egypt). This is reiterated in the Books of Chronicles () as well as later histories such as Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; i.vi.2, which placed them explicitly in Egypt and the &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; 10 which describes them living by the Nile. A migration of the Philistines from Caphtor is mentioned in the Book of Amos ().

Josephus, (&quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; I, vi) using extra-Biblical accounts, provides context for the migration from Caphtor to Philistia. He records that the Caphtorites were one of the Egyptian peoples whose cities were destroyed during the Ethiopic War.

Tradition regarding the location of Caphtor was preserved in the Aramaic Targums and in the commentary of Maimonides which place it at Caphutkia in the vicinity of Damietta (at the eastern edge of the Nile delta near classical Pelusium). This view is supported by the tenth century biblical exegete Saadia Gaon, and by Benjamin of Tudela, the twelfth-century Jewish traveller from Navarre, who both wrote that Damietta was Caphtor.

The Midrash Rabbah on Genesis 37:5 (page 298 in the 1961 edition of Maurice Simon&#x27;s translation) says that the &quot;Caphtorim were dwarfs&quot;.

==In archaeological sources==

===Mari Tablets===
A location called &quot;Kaptar&quot; is mentioned in several texts of the Mari Tablets and is understood to be reference to Caphtor. An inscription dating to c. 1780-1760 BCE mentions a man from Caphtor (&quot;a-na Kap-ta-ra-i-im&quot;) who received tin from Mari. Another Mari text from the same period mentions a Caphtorite weapon (&quot;kakku Kap-ta-ru-ú&quot;). Another records a Caphtorite object (&quot;ka-ta-pu-um Kap-ta-ru-ú&quot;) which had been sent by king Zimrilim of the same period, to king Shariya (king) of Razama. A text in connection with Hammurabi mentions Caphtorite (&quot;k[a-a]p-ta-ri-tum&quot;) fabric that was sent to Mesopotamia via Mari. An inventory thought to be from the same era as the previous texts mentions a Caphtorite vessel (&quot;GAL kap-ta-ri-tum&quot;) (probably a large jug or jar).

===Ras Shamra Texts===
An Akkadian text from the archives of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria) contains a possible reference to Caphtor: it mentions a ship that is exempt from duty when arriving from a place whose name is written with the Akkadian cuneiform signs &quot;KUR.DUGUD.RI&quot;. &quot;KUR&quot; is a determinative indicating a country, while one possible reading of the sign &quot;DUGUD&quot; is , whence the name of the place would be &quot;Kabturi&quot;, which resembles Caphtor.

Within Ugaritic inscriptions from the Amarna period, &quot;k-p-t-r&quot; is mentioned and understood to be Caphtor: A poem uses &quot;k-p-t-r&quot; as a parallel for Egypt (&quot;H-k-p-t&quot;) naming it as the home of the god Kothar-wa-Khasis the Ugaritic equivalent of the Egyptian god Ptah. Prior to the discovery of the reference to &quot;H-k-p-t&quot; scholars had already considered the possibility of &quot;iy Caphtor&quot; found in Jeremiah being the Semitic cognate of &quot;Egypt&quot;.

===Egyptian inscriptions===
The name &quot;k-p-t-ȝ-r&quot; is found written in hieroglyphics in a list of locations in the Ptolemaic temple of Kom Ombo in Upper Egypt and is regarded as a reference to Caphtor.

The reference to &quot;k-p-t-ȝ-r&quot; should not be confused with other inscriptions at the temple and from earlier sites mentioning a locality called &quot;Keftiu&quot; listed amongst lands to the northeast of Egypt and having different spelling and pronunciation, although it has been conjectured by some scholars that this is also a reference to Caphtor. Attempts to identify Caphtor with Keftiu go back to the 19th century and argue that &quot;r&quot; changed to &quot;y&quot; in the Egyptian language. However the name &quot;k-p-t-ȝ-r&quot; more closely resembling &quot;Caphtor&quot; is from the (late) Ptolemaic era and still has the &quot;r&quot; and references to &quot;Keftiu&quot; occur separately at the same site. Those arguing for the identification suggest that &quot;k-p-t-ȝ-r&quot; is an Egyptian transliteration of the Semitic form of the name and that &quot;Keftiu&quot; is the true Egyptian form. Sayce had however already argued in the 19th century that the names in the text in which &quot;k-p-t-ȝ-r&quot; occurs were not transliterations of the Semitic forms. Other scholars have disagreed over whether this can be said for the occurrence of &quot;k-p-t-ȝ-r&quot;.

The equation of Keftiu with Caphtor commonly features in interpretations that equate Caphtor with Crete, Cyprus, or a locality in Anatolia. Jean Vercoutter in the 1950s had argued, based on an inscription of the tomb of Rekhmire that Keftiu could not be set apart from the &quot;islands of the sea&quot; which he identified as a reference to the Aegean Sea. However in 2003, Claude Vandersleyen pointed out that the term &quot;wedj wer&quot; (literally &quot;great green&quot;) which Vercoutter had translated &quot;the sea&quot; actually refers to the vegetation growing on the banks of the Nile and in the Nile Delta, and that the text places Keftiu in the Nile Delta.

This issue is not settled though. In Caphtor / Keftiu: a New Investigation, John Strange argues that the late geographical lists referenced in the preceding paragraph cannot be taken at face value, as they appear to be &quot;random&quot; collections of antique place names, and contain other corruptions and duplicates.

==Translation==
The targumim translate Caphtor into Aramaic as &quot;Kaputkai&quot;, &quot;Kapudka&quot; or similar i.e. Caphutkia explained by Maimonides as being Damietta on the coastland of Egypt.

Referencing Katpatuka, the Septuagint translated the name as &quot;Kappadokias&quot; and the Vulgate similarly renders it as &quot;Cappadocia&quot;. The seventeenth-century scholar Samuel Bochart understood this as a reference to Cappadocia in Anatolia but John Gill writes that these translations relate to Caphutkia.

==Modern identifications==

From the 18th century onwards commentators attempted several identifications of Caphtor which increasingly disregarded the traditional identification as an Egyptian coastal locality in the vicinity of Pelusium. These included identification with Coptus, Colchis, Cyprus, Cappadocia in Asia Minor, Cilicia, and Crete.

The identification with Coptus is recorded in Osborne&#x27;s &quot;A Universal History From The Earliest Account of Time&quot;, where it is remarked that many suppose the name to have originated from Caphtor. While this interpretation agrees with tradition placing Caphtor in Egypt it disregards the tradition that it was a coastland (&quot;iy&quot; rendered island in some Bible translations) and more precisely Caphutkia; and this contradiction is noted in Osborne. It is now known that the name Coptus is derived from Egyptian &quot;Gebtu&quot; which is possibly not associated with the name Caphtor.

Egyptian &quot;kftı͗w&quot; (conventionally vocalized as &quot;Keftiu&quot;) is attested in numerous inscriptions. The 19th-century belief that Keftiu/Caphtor was to be identified with Cyprus or Syria shifted to an association with Crete under the influence of Sir Arthur Evans. It was criticized in 1931 by G. A. Wainwright, who located &quot;Keftiu&quot; in Cilicia, on the Mediterranean shore of Asia Minor, and he drew together evidence from a wide variety of sources: in geographical lists and the inscription of Tutmose III&#x27;s &quot;Hymn of Victory&quot;, where the place of &quot;Keftiu&quot; in lists appeared to exist among recognizable regions in the northeasternmost corner of the Mediterranean, in the text of the &quot;Keftiuan spell&quot; &quot;śntkppwymntrkkr&quot;, of ca 1200 BCE, in which the Cilician and Syrian deities Tarku (the Hittite sun god), Sandan (the Cilician and Lydian equivalent of Tarku), and Kubaba were claimed, in personal names associated in texts with &quot;Keftiu&quot; and in Tutmose&#x27;s &quot;silver shawabty vessel of the work of Keftiu&quot; and vessels of iron, which were received as gifts from Tinay in northern Syria. Wainwright&#x27;s theory is not widely accepted, as his evidence shows at most a cultural exchange between Keftiu and Anatolia without pinpointing its location on the Mediterranean coast.

In 1980 J. Strange drew together a comprehensive collection of documents that mentioned &quot;Caphtor&quot; or &quot;Keftiu&quot;. He writes that crucial texts dissociate &quot;Keftiu&quot; from &quot;the islands in the middle of the sea&quot;, by which Egyptian scribes denoted Crete.

The stone base of a statue during the reign of Amenhotep III includes the name &quot;kftı͗w&quot; in a list of Mediterranean ship stops prior to several Cretan cities such as Kydonia, Phaistos, and Amnisos, showing that the term clearly refers to the Aegean.

<text>Kecak (, pronounced &quot;kechak&quot;), alternate spellings: kechak and ketjak), known in Indonesian as &quot;tari kecak&quot;, is a form of Balinese Hindu dance and music drama that was developed in the 1930s. Since its creation, it has been performed primarily by men, with the first women&#x27;s &quot;kecak&quot; group having started in 2006. The dance is based on the story of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and is traditionally performed in temples and villages across Bali, Indonesia.

Also known as the Ramayana monkey chant, the dance is performed by a circle of as many as 150 performers wearing checked cloths around their waists, percussively chanting &quot;chak&quot;, and moving their hands and arms. The performance depicts a battle of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, in which the monkey-like Vanaras, led by Hanuman, help Prince Rama fight the evil King Ravana. &quot;Kecak&quot; has roots in &quot;sanghyang,&quot; a trance-inducing exorcism dance.

==History==

&quot;Kecak&quot; was originally a trance ritual accompanied by a male chorus. 

In the 1930s, Walter Spies, a German painter and musician, became deeply interested in the ritual while living in Bali. He adapted it as a drama based on the Hindu &quot;Ramayana&quot; and including dance, intended for performance before Western tourist audiences.

Walter Spies worked with Indonesian dancer Wayan Limbak, who popularized the dance by arranging internationally touring performances by Balinese groups. These tours helped make the &quot;kecak&quot; internationally known.


This is an example of what James Clifford describes as part of the &quot;modern art-culture system&quot; in which &quot;the West or the central power adopts, transforms, and consumes non-Western or peripheral cultural elements, while making &#x27;art,&#x27; which was once embedded in the culture as a whole, into a separate entity&quot;. I Wayan Dibia, a performer, choreographer and scholar, suggests, by contrast, that the Balinese were already developing this form when Spies arrived on the island. For example, during the 1920s, Limbak had incorporated &quot;baris&quot; movements into the &quot;cak&quot; leader role. &quot;Spies liked this innovation,&quot; and he suggested that Limbak &quot;devise a spectacle based on the &quot;Ramayana&quot;,&quot; accompanied by &quot;cak&quot; chorus rather than gamelan, as would have been usual.

==Performance==

The &quot;kecak&quot; dance is typically performed by about fifty to one hundred men wearing only loincloths; their upper bodies are left bare. They form concentric circles, in the middle of which is a traditional Balinese coconut oil lamp. First they move their bodies rhythmically to the left and to the right, chanting the words &quot;chak ke-chak ke-chak ke-chak&quot; continuously in coordinated harmony and beat, in slow rhythm. Gradually the rhythm speeds up and by turns they lift their hands, trembling, into the air. The &quot;kecak&quot; sound can be classified as a &quot;musical&quot; performance with the use of the human voice purely with no musical instruments. The dance is performed for dance-dramas and the story presented is taken from the &quot;Ramayana&quot; Hindu epic. The bare-chested male &quot;kecak&quot; chanters play the role of Rama&#x27;s troops of Vanaras (apes) and Ravana&#x27;s troops of Rakshasas (Demons).

The duration of the performance is around an hour. The story of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; is depicted, beginning with Sita and Rama&#x27;s exile in the jungle of Dandaka. The performance reenacts the appearance of the Golden Deer, the abduction of Sita by Ravana, the battle between Ravana and Jatayu, the search for Sita by Hanuman, and ends with the battle between Rama and Ravana. The &quot;kecak&quot; chanters chant and sing in accordance with the mood and milieu of the story.

&quot;Kecak&quot; dance performances in Bali usually take place daily in the evening (6 pm, Bali time) at Balinese Hindu temples such as Uluwatu Temple and Tanah Lot. There are also dance stages used exclusively for &quot;kecak&quot; performances in Ubud, Garuda Wisnu Kencana, Batu Bulan, Pandawa beach and other places in Bali. &quot;Kecak&quot; performances also take place on other occasions, such as for cultural and entertainment displays. Dancers usually come from local villagers of the surrounding area of the performance; they usually have a main job other than dancing which they finish before performing the &quot;kecak&quot; dance. The dancers&#x27; income from the dance usually comes from tickets sold to the spectators. The most popular destination for &quot;kechak&quot; dance performances is Uluwatu Temple.

===Dancers===

The dancers consist of two types: the &quot;kecak&quot; male-chanters and the main &quot;Ramayana&quot; dancers who play the roles of Sita, Rama, Lakshmana, Ravana, Hanuman, Jatayu, etc. Some of the &quot;kecak&quot; male-chanters who chant &quot;chak-chak-chak&quot; have their own tasks during the performance. One individual is responsible for maintaining the beat of the chant by chanting &quot;&quot;po-po-po-po&quot;. Another man serves as the leader of the chorus, instructing them to stop or start the chanting by yelling command vocals such as &quot;Diih!&quot;, &quot;Chiaaat!&quot;, etc. There is also a man whose job is to sing during the chanting; he sings in a melodious or rhythmic tone according to the situation of the dance with vocalizations such as &quot;Shiiir-yang-ngger-yang-nggur-yang-nggeer&quot;. Another man, known as the &quot;dalang&quot;, narrates the story during the dance, usually in Balinese and Sanskrit. The men chosen for these tasks are usually the senior male dancers. The remaining chanters chant &quot;chak-chak-chak&quot;&quot; continuously and simultaneously with harmony.

The dancers who represent the core &quot;Ramayana&quot; characters are considered an essential part of the dance. Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and the Golden Deer, whose movements are gentle and smooth, are sometimes played by female dancers who are trained in such styles of movement. Men play muscular characters such as Ravan, Hanuman, Sugriv, etc.

===Trance===
Trance rituals often accompany certain sections of the &quot;kecak&quot; dance, such as during the portrayal of the burning of Hanuman. Here, the dancer playing Hanuman is blessed by a priest and enters a trance state for the fire kicking dance which follows. The dancer does not feel any pain from the fire because he is in a state of trance.

<text>Integrated pest management (IPM), also known as integrated pest control (IPC) integrates both chemical and non-chemical practices for economic control of pests. The UN&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization defines IPM as &quot;the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.&quot; Entomologists and ecologists have urged the adoption of IPM pest control since the 1970s. IPM is a safer pest control framework than reliance on the use of chemical pesticides, mitigating risks such as: insecticide-induced resurgence, pesticide resistance and (especially food) crop residues.

== History ==

Shortly after World War II, when synthetic insecticides were introduced, entomologists in California developed the concept of &quot;supervised insect control&quot;. Around the same time, entomologists in the US Cotton Belt were advocating a similar approach. Under this scheme, insect control was &quot;supervised&quot; by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. This was viewed as an alternative to calendar-based programs. Supervised control was based on knowledge of the ecology and analysis of projected trends in pest and natural-enemy populations.

Supervised control formed much of the conceptual basis for the &quot;integrated control&quot; that University of California entomologists articulated in the 1950s. Integrated control sought to identify the best mix of chemical and biological controls for a given insect pest. Chemical insecticides were to be used in the manner least disruptive to biological control. The term &quot;integrated&quot; was thus synonymous with &quot;compatible.&quot; Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level that required treatment (the economic threshold) to prevent the population from reaching a level at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures (the economic injury level).

IPM extended the concept of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all tactics. Controls such as pesticides were to be applied as in integrated control, but these now had to be compatible with tactics for all classes of pests. Other tactics, such as host-plant resistance and cultural manipulations, became part of the IPM framework. IPM combined entomologists, plant pathologists, nematologists and weed scientists.

In the United States, IPM was formulated into national policy in February 1972 as directed by President Richard Nixon. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter established an interagency IPM Coordinating Committee to ensure development and implementation of IPM practices.

Perry Adkisson and Ray F. Smith received the 1997 World Food Prize for encouraging the use of IPM.

== Applications ==
IPM is used in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation of cultural property and general pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management. IPM practices help to prevent and slow the development of resistance, known as resistance management.

== Principles ==
An American IPM system is designed around six basic components:
* Acceptable pest levels—The emphasis is on &quot;control&quot;, not &quot;eradication&quot;. IPM holds that wiping out an entire pest population is often impossible, and the attempt can be expensive and unsafe. IPM programmes first work to establish acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls if those thresholds are crossed. These thresholds are pest and site specific, meaning that it may be acceptable at one site to have a weed such as white clover, but not at another site. Allowing a pest population to survive at a reasonable threshold reduces selection pressure. This lowers the rate at which a pest develops resistance to a control, because if almost all pests are killed then those that have resistance will provide the genetic basis of the future population. Retaining a significant number of unresistant specimens dilutes the prevalence of any resistant genes that appear. Similarly, the repeated use of a single class of controls will create pest populations that are more resistant to that class, whereas alternating among classes helps prevent this.
* Preventive cultural practices—Selecting varieties best for local growing conditions and maintaining healthy crops is the first line of defense. Plant quarantine and &#x27;cultural techniques&#x27; such as crop sanitation are next, e.g., removal of diseased plants, and cleaning pruning shears to prevent spread of infections. Beneficial fungi and bacteria are added to the potting media of horticultural crops vulnerable to root diseases, greatly reducing the need for fungicides.
* Monitoring—Regular observation is critically important. Observation is broken into inspection and identification. Visual inspection, insect and spore traps, and other methods are used to monitor pest levels. Record-keeping is essential, as is a thorough knowledge of target pest behavior and reproductive cycles. Since insects are cold-blooded, their physical development is dependent on area temperatures. Many insects have had their development cycles modeled in terms of degree-days. The degree days of an environment determines the optimal time for a specific insect outbreak. Plant pathogens follow similar patterns of response to weather and season. Automated systems based on AI have been developed to identify and monitor flies using e-trapping devices.
* Mechanical controls—Should a pest reach an unacceptable level, mechanical methods are the first options. They include simple hand-picking, barriers, traps, vacuuming and tillage to disrupt breeding.
* Biological controls—Natural biological processes and materials can provide control, with acceptable environmental impact, and often at lower cost. The main approach is to promote beneficial insects that eat or parasitize target pests. Biological insecticides, derived from naturally occurring microorganisms (&quot;e.g.&quot;—&quot;Bt&quot;, entomopathogenic fungi and entomopathogenic nematodes), also fall in this category. Further &#x27;biology-based&#x27; or &#x27;ecological&#x27; techniques are under evaluation.
* Responsible use—Synthetic pesticides are used as required and often only at specific times in a pest&#x27;s life cycle. Many newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances (&quot;e.g.&quot;—nicotine, pyrethrum and insect juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active component may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Applications of pesticides must reach their intended targets. Matching the application technique to the crop, the pest, and the pesticide is critical, for example, the use of low-volume spray equipment can considerably reduce overall pesticide use and operational costs.

Although originally developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes now encompass diseases, weeds and other pests that interfere with management objectives for sites such as residential and commercial structures, lawn and turf areas, and home and community gardens. Predictive models have proved to be suitable tools supporting the implementation of IPM programmes.

== Process ==

IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, ecological and social consequences and is applicable to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations. The IPM process starts with monitoring, which includes inspection and identification, followed by the establishment of economic injury levels. The economic injury levels set the economic threshold level. Economic Injury level is the pest population level at which crop damage exceeds the cost of treatment of pest. This can also be an action threshold level for determining an unacceptable level that is not tied to economic injury. Action thresholds are more common in structural pest management and economic injury levels in classic agricultural pest management. An example of an action threshold is one fly in a hospital operating room is not acceptable, but one fly in a pet kennel would be acceptable. Once a threshold has been crossed by the pest population action steps need to be taken to reduce and control the pest. Integrated pest management employs a variety of actions including cultural controls such as physical barriers, biological controls such as adding and conserving natural predators and enemies of the pest, and finally chemical controls or pesticides. Reliance on knowledge, experience, observation and integration of multiple techniques makes IPM appropriate for organic farming (excluding synthetic pesticides). These may or may not include materials listed on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in organic farming and organic gardening are generally safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm. For conventional farms IPM can reduce human and environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals, and potentially lower overall costs.

Risk assessment usually includes four issues: 1) characterization of biological control agents, 2) health risks, 3) environmental risks and 4) efficacy.

Mistaken identification of a pest may result in ineffective actions. E.g., plant damage due to over-watering could be mistaken for fungal infection, since many fungal and viral infections arise under moist conditions.

Monitoring begins immediately, before the pest&#x27;s activity becomes significant. Monitoring of agricultural pests includes tracking soil/planting media fertility and water quality. Overall plant health and resistance to pests is greatly influenced by pH, alkalinity, of dissolved mineral and oxygen reduction potential. Many diseases are waterborne, spread directly by irrigation water and indirectly by splashing.

Once the pest is known, knowledge of its lifecycle provides the optimal intervention points. For example, weeds reproducing from last year&#x27;s seed can be prevented with mulches and pre-emergent herbicide.

Pest-tolerant crops such as soybeans may not warrant interventions unless the pests are numerous or rapidly increasing. Intervention is warranted if the expected cost of damage by the pest is more than the cost of control. Health hazards may require intervention that is not warranted by economic considerations.

Specific sites may also have varying requirements. E.g., white clover may be acceptable on the sides of a tee box on a golf course, but unacceptable in the fairway where it could confuse the field of play.

Possible interventions include mechanical/physical, cultural, biological and chemical. Mechanical/physical controls include picking pests off plants, or using netting or other material to exclude pests such as birds from grapes or rodents from structures. Cultural controls include keeping an area free of conducive conditions by removing waste or diseased plants, flooding, sanding, and the use of disease-resistant crop varieties. Biological controls are numerous. They include: conservation of natural predators or augmentation of natural predators, sterile insect technique (SIT).

Augmentation, inoculative release and inundative release are different methods of biological control that affect the target pest in different ways. Augmentative control includes the periodic introduction of predators. With inundative release, predators are collected, mass-reared and periodically released in large numbers into the pest area. This is used for an immediate reduction in host populations, generally for annual crops, but is not suitable for long run use. With inoculative release a limited number of beneficial organisms are introduced at the start of the growing season. This strategy offers long term control as the organism&#x27;s progeny affect pest populations throughout the season and is common in orchards. With seasonal inoculative release the beneficials are collected, mass-reared and released seasonally to maintain the beneficial population. This is commonly used in greenhouses. In America and other western countries, inundative releases are predominant, while Asia and the eastern Europe more commonly use inoculation and occasional introductions.

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an area-wide IPM program that introduces sterile male pests into the pest population to trick females into (unsuccessful) breeding encounters, providing a form of birth control and reducing reproduction rates. The biological controls mentioned above only appropriate in extreme cases, because in the introduction of new species, or supplementation of naturally occurring species can have detrimental ecosystem effects. Biological controls can be used to stop invasive species or pests, but they can become an introduction path for new pests.

Chemical controls include horticultural oils or the application of insecticides and herbicides. A green pest management IPM program uses pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring materials.

Pesticides can be classified by their modes of action. Rotating among materials with diverse modes of action minimizes pest resistance.

Evaluation is the process of assessing whether the intervention was effective, whether it produced unacceptable side effects, whether to continue, revise or abandon the program.

== Southeast Asia ==

The Green Revolution of the 1960s and &#x27;70s introduced sturdier plants that could support the heavier grain loads resulting from intensive fertilizer use. Pesticide imports by 11 Southeast Asian countries grew nearly sevenfold in value between 1990 and 2010, according to FAO statistics, with disastrous results. Rice farmers become accustomed to spraying soon after planting, triggered by signs of the leaf folder moth, which appears early in the growing season. It causes only superficial damage and doesn&#x27;t reduce yields. In 1986, Indonesia banned 57 pesticides and completely stopped subsidizing their use. Progress was reversed in the 2000s, when growing production capacity, particularly in China, reduced prices. Rice production in Asia more than doubled. But it left farmers believing more is better—whether it&#x27;s seed, fertilizer, or pesticides.

The brown planthopper, &quot;Nilaparvata lugens&quot;, the farmers&#x27; main target, has become increasingly resistant. Since 2008, outbreaks have devastated rice harvests throughout Asia, but not in the Mekong Delta. Reduced spraying allowed natural predators to neutralize planthoppers in Vietnam. In 2010 and 2011, massive planthopper outbreaks hit 400,000 hectares of Thai rice fields, causing losses of about $64 million. The Thai government is now pushing the &quot;no spray in the first 40 days&quot; approach.

By contrast early spraying kills frogs, spiders, wasps and dragonflies that prey on the later-arriving and dangerous planthopper and produced resistant strains. Planthoppers now require pesticide doses 500 times greater than originally. Overuse indiscriminately kills beneficial insects and decimates bird and amphibian populations. Pesticides are suspected of harming human health and became a common means for rural Asians to commit suicide.

In 2001, 950 Vietnamese farmers tried IPM. In one plot, each farmer grew rice using their usual amounts of seed and fertilizer, applying pesticide as they chose. In a nearby plot, less seed and fertilizer were used and no pesticides were applied for 40 days after planting. Yields from the experimental plots were as good or better and costs were lower, generating 8% to 10% more net income. The experiment led to the &quot;three reductions, three gains&quot; campaign, claiming that cutting the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticide would boost yield, quality and income. Posters, leaflets, TV commercials and a 2004 radio soap opera that featured a rice farmer who gradually accepted the changes. It didn&#x27;t hurt that a 2006 planthopper outbreak hit farmers using insecticides harder than those who didn&#x27;t. Mekong Delta farmers cut insecticide spraying from five times per crop cycle to zero to one.

The Plant Protection Center and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) have been encouraging farmers to grow flowers, okra, and beans on rice paddy banks, instead of stripping vegetation, as was typical. The plants attract bees and wasps that eat planthopper eggs, while the vegetables diversify farm incomes.

Agriculture companies offer bundles of pesticides with seeds and fertilizer, with incentives for volume purchases. A proposed law in Vietnam requires licensing pesticide dealers and government approval of advertisements to prevent exaggerated claims. Insecticides that target other pests, such as &quot;Scirpophaga incertulas&quot; (stem borer), the larvae of moth species that feed on rice plants allegedly yield gains of 21% with proper use.

<text>Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo (24 August 192430 November 1989) was a Cameroonian politician who was the first president of Cameroon from 1960 until 1982. He was previously the first Prime Minister from the country&#x27;s independence in January 1960 until May of that same year following the creation of the presidency.

Ahidjo played a major role in the establishment of Cameroon as an independent state in 1960 as well as integrating the French and English-speaking parts of the country. During Ahidjo&#x27;s time in office, he established a centralised political system. In foreign affairs, Ahidjo pursued a pro-France policy, and benefitted from French support when defeating the pro-communist rebellion of the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) in 1970.

Ahidjo established a single-party state under the Cameroon National Union (CNU) in 1966. In 1972, Ahidjo abolished the federation in favor of a unitary state. Ahidjo resigned from the presidency in 1982, and Paul Biya assumed the presidency. This was an action that was surprising to Cameroonians.

Accused of being behind a coup plot against Biya in 1984, Ahidjo was sentenced to death in absentia, but he died of natural causes in 1989 whilst in exile in Dakar, Senegal.

==Early life==
Ahidjo was born in Garoua, a major river port along the Benue River in northern Cameroun, which was at the time a French mandate territory. His mother was a Fulani of slave descent, while his father was a Fulani village chief.

Ahidjo&#x27;s mother raised him as a Muslim and sent him to Quranic kuttab school as a child. In 1932, he began attending local government primary school. After failing his first school certification examination in 1938, Ahidjo worked for a few months in the veterinary service. He returned to school and obtained his school certification a year later. Ahidjo spent the next three years attending secondary school at the Ecole Primaire Supérieur in Yaoundé, the capital of the mandate, studying for a career in the civil service. His classmates are, among others, Félix Sabbal-Lecco, Minister under his government, Abel Moumé Etia, first Cameroonian meteorological engineer and writer, as well as Jean-Faustin Betayéné, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Federal Cameroon. At school, Ahidjo also played soccer and competed as a cyclist.

In 1942, Ahidjo joined the civil service as a radio operator for a postal service. As part of his job, he worked on assignments in several major cities throughout the country, such as Douala, Ngaoundéré, Bertoua, and Mokolo. According to his official biographer, Ahidjo was the first civil servant from northern Cameroun to work in the southern areas of the territory. His experiences throughout the country were, according to Harvey Glickman, professor emeritus of political science at Haverford College and scholar of African politics, responsible for fostering his sense of national identity and provided him the sagacity to handle the problems of governing a multiethnic state.

==Political career==
In 1946, Ahidjo entered territorial politics. From 1953 to 1957, Ahidjo was a member of the Assembly of the French Union. From 28 January 1957, to 10 May 1957, Ahidjo served as President of the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon. In the same year he became Deputy Prime Minister in &quot;de facto&quot; head of state André-Marie Mbida&#x27;s government. In February 1958, Ahidjo became Prime Minister at the age of thirty-four after Mbida resigned. He was reassuring towards the Church and the Muslim aristocracies in the north of the country and succeeded in embodying the union of conservative currents concerned about the growing number of protest movements in the 1950s. While serving as Prime Minister, Ahidjo had administrative goals to move toward independence for Cameroon while reuniting the separated factions of the country and cooperating with French colonial powers. On 12 June, with a motion from the National Assembly, Ahidjo became involved in negotiations with France in Paris. These negotiations continued through October, resulting in formal recognition of Cameroonian plans for independence. The date for the simultaneous termination of French trusteeship and Cameroonian independence was set by Cameroon&#x27;s National Assembly for 1 January 1960. During and immediately after Cameroon was decolonized, Ahidjo recruited follow northern, Muslim Fulani and Peuhl into the army and an elite guard.

Ahidjo&#x27;s support and collaboration in allowing for continued French influence economically and politically was faced with opposition from radicals who rejected French influence. These radicals were sympathetic to a more revolutionary, procommunist approach to decolonization. They formed their own political party, Union des Populations du Cameroun. In March 1959, Ahidjo addressed the United Nations General Assembly in order to gather support for France&#x27;s independence plan. Influenced by Cold War tensions, the United Nations expressed concern about the UPC due to the party&#x27;s pro-communist disposition. The United Nations moved to end French trusteeship in Cameroon without organizing new elections or lifting the ban that France had imposed on the UPC. Ahidjo experienced a rebellion in the 1960s from the UPC, but defeated it by 1970 with the aid of French military force. Ahidjo proposed and was granted four bills to gather power and declare a state of emergency in order to end the rebellion.

Following the independence of the French-controlled area of Cameroon, Ahidjo&#x27;s focus turned on reuniting the British-controlled area of Cameroon with its newly independent counterpart. In addressing the United Nations, Ahidjo and his supporters favored integration and reunification whereas more radical players such as the UPC preferred immediate reunification. However, both sides were seeking a plebiscite for reunification of the separated Cameroons. The UN decided on the integration and reunification plebiscite. The plebiscite resulted in northern area of the British Cameroons voting to join Nigeria and the southern area voting to reunite with the rest of Cameroon. Ahidjo worked with Premier John Foncha of the Anglophone Cameroon throughout the process of integrating the two parts of Cameroon. In July 1961, Ahidjo attended a conference at which the plans and conditions for merging the Cameroons were made and later adopted by both the National Assemblies of the Francophone and Anglophone Cameroons. Ahidjo and Foncha met in Bamenda in order to create a constitution for the united territories. In their meetings, Ahidjo and Foncha agreed not to join the French community or the Commonwealth. In the summer of 1961, Ahidjo and Foncha resolved any issues between them and agreed upon the final draft for the constitution, which was drawn in Foumban, a city in West Cameroon. Despite the fact that the plans to establish a federalist state were made public in Foumban, Ahidjo and Foncha had private discussions before the official Foumban conference. On 1 October 1961, the two separate Cameroons were merged, establishing the Federal Republic of Cameroon with Ahidjo as the president and Foncha as the Vice President.

The issue of territorial administration was a topic of disagreement between Foncha and Ahidjo. In December 1961, Ahidjo issued a decree that split the federation into administrative regions under the Federal Inspectors of Administration. The inspectors were responsible to Ahidjo and for representing the federation, with access to police force and federal services. The power given to these inspectors led to conflict between them and Prime Ministers.

During the first years of the regime, the French ambassador Jean-Pierre Bénard is sometimes considered as the true &quot;president&quot; of Cameroon. This independence is indeed largely theoretical since French &quot;advisers&quot; are responsible for assisting each minister and have the reality of power. The Gaullist government preserves its influence over the country through the signing of &quot;cooperation agreements&quot; covering all sectors of Cameroon&#x27;s sovereignty. Thus, in the monetary field, Cameroon retains the CFA franc and entrusts its monetary policy to its former guardian power. All strategic resources are exploited by France, French troops are maintained in the country, and a large proportion of Cameroonian army officers are French, including the Chief of Staff.

In 1961, Ahidjo began calling for a single-party state. On 12 March 1962, Ahidjo issued a decree that prevented criticism against his regime, giving the government the authority to imprison anyone found guilty of subversion against government authorities or laws. In July 1962, a group of opposition party leaders who had served in the government with Ahidjo, André-Marie Mbida, Charles Okala, Marcel Bey Bey Eyidi, and Theodore Mayi Martip, challenged Ahidjo&#x27;s call for a single-party state, saying that it was dictatorial. These leaders were arrested, tried, and imprisoned on the grounds of subversion against the government. The arrest of these leaders resulted in many other opposition leaders joining Ahidjo&#x27;s Party, the Union Camerounaise. On 1 September 1966, Ahidjo achieved his goal of creating a single-party state. The CNU was established, with Ahidjo maintaining that it was essential to the unity of Cameroon. In order to be elected to the National Assembly, membership in the CNU was required. Therefore, Ahidjo approved all nominations for the National Assembly as head of the party, and they approved all his legislation.

The authorities are multiplying the legal provisions enabling them to free themselves from the rule of law: arbitrary extension of police custody, prohibition of meetings and rallies, submission of publications to prior censorship, restriction of freedom of movement through the establishment of passes or curfews, prohibition for trade unions to issue subscriptions, etc. Anyone accused of &quot;compromising public safety&quot; is deprived of a lawyer and cannot appeal the judgment. Sentences of life imprisonment at hard labour or death penalty – executions can be public – are thus numerous. A one-party system was introduced in 1966.

Ahidjo placed the blame for Cameroon&#x27;s underdevelopment and poorly implemented town and public planning policies on Cameroon&#x27;s federal structure, as well as charging federalism with maintaining cleavages and issues between the Anglophone and Francophone parts of Cameroon. Ahidjo&#x27;s government also argued that managing separate governments in a poor country was too expensive. Ahidjo announced on 6 May 1972, that he wanted to abolish the federation and put a unitary state into place if the electorate supported the idea in a referendum set for 20 May 1972. This event became known as &quot;The Glorious Revolution of May Twentieth.&quot; Because Ahidjo held control over the CNU, he was ensured the party&#x27;s support in this initiative. Ahidjo issued Presidential Decree No. 72–720 on 2 June 1972, which established the United Republic of Cameroon and abolished the federation. A new constitution was adopted by Ahidjo&#x27;s government in the same year, abolishing the position of Vice President, which served to further centralize power in Cameroon. Ahidjo&#x27;s power presided over not only the state and government, but also as commander of the military. In 1975, however, Ahidjo instituted the position of Prime Minister, which was filled by Paul Biya. In 1979, Ahidjo initiated a change in the constitution designating the Prime Minister as successor. Until 1972, Cameroon&#x27;s federation consisted of two relatively autonomous parts: the francophone and anglophone. After the federation was abolished, many anglophones were displeased with the changes.

In 1972, when Cameroon hosted the Africa Cup of Nations, Ahidjo ordered the construction of two new stadiums, the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium and the Unification Stadium. The Unification Stadium was named in celebration of the country being renamed as the United Republic of Cameroon.

Cameroon became an oil-producing country in 1977. Claiming to want to make reserves for difficult times, the authorities manage &quot;off-budget&quot; oil revenues in total opacity (the funds are placed in Paris, Switzerland and New York accounts). Several billion dollars are thus diverted to the benefit of oil companies and regime officials. The influence of France and its 9,000 nationals in Cameroon remains considerable. African Affairs magazine noted in the early 1980s that they &quot;continue to dominate almost all key sectors of the economy, much as they did before independence. French nationals control 55% of the modern sector of the Cameroonian economy and their control over the banking system is total.

Though many of his actions were dictatorial, Cameroon became one of the most stable in Africa. He was considered to be more conservative and less charismatic than most post-colonial African leaders, but his policies allowed Cameroon to attain comparative prosperity. Courtiers surrounding Ahidjo promoted the myth that he was &quot;father of the nation.&quot;

Ahidjo&#x27;s presidential style was cultivated around the image of himself as the father of the nation. He carried many titles, and after he visited Mecca, Ahidjo gained the title of &quot;El Hadj.&quot; Ahidjo used radio to regularly lecture the nation and to announce the regular reassignment of government positions. Ahidjo built up a clientelistic network in which he redistributed state resources to maintain control over a diverse Cameroon. When Cameroon began seeing oil revenue, the president was in control of the funds. People received jobs, licenses, contracts, and projects through Ahidjo in exchange for loyalty.

During Ahidjo&#x27;s presidency, music served a role in maintaining for national unity and development. Musicians wrote songs with themes of independence, unity, and Ahidjo as the father of the nation. On official holidays, schools would compete by writing patriotic songs in Ahidjo&#x27;s honor. Songs that were critical of politicians were rare. Musicians such as Medzo Me Nsom encouraged the people of Cameroon to turn out at the pols and vote for Ahidjo.

== Post-presidency, later life and death ==
Ahidjo resigned, ostensibly for health reasons, on 4 November 1982 and was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya two days later. That he stepped down in favor of Biya, a Christian from the south and not a Muslim from the north like himself, was considered surprising. Ahidjo&#x27;s ultimate intentions were unclear; it is possible that he intended to return to the presidency at a later point when his health improved, and another possibility is that he intended for Maigari Bello Bouba, a fellow Muslim from the north who succeeded Biya as Prime Minister, to be his eventual successor as president, with Biya in effectively a caretaker role. Although the Central Committee of the ruling Cameroon National Union (CNU) urged Ahidjo to remain President, he declined to do so, but he did agree to remain as the President of the CNU. However, he also arranged for Biya to become the CNU Vice-President and handle party affairs in his absence. During the first few months of Biya&#x27;s administration, there was cooperation between Biya and Ahidjo. In January 1983, Ahidjo dismissed four CNU members who opposed Biya&#x27;s presidency. Additionally that month, Ahidjo and Biya both went on separate speaking tours to different parts of Cameroon in order to address the public&#x27;s concerns.

Later that year, however, a major feud developed between Ahidjo and Biya. On 19 July 1983, Ahidjo went into exile in France, and Biya began removing Ahidjo&#x27;s supporters from positions of power and eliminating symbols of his authority, removing official photographs of Ahidjo from the public as well as removing Ahidjo&#x27;s name from the anthem of the CNU. On 22 August, Biya announced that a plot allegedly involving Ahidjo had been uncovered. For his part, Ahidjo severely criticized Biya, alleging that Biya was abusing his power, that he lived in fear of plots against him, and that he was a threat to national unity. The two were unable to reconcile despite the efforts of several foreign leaders, and Ahidjo announced on 27 August that he was resigning as head of the CNU. In exile, Ahidjo was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in February 1984, along with two others, for participation in the June 1983 coup plot, although Biya commuted the sentence to life in prison. Ahidjo denied involvement in the plot. A violent but unsuccessful coup attempt in April 1984 was also widely believed to have been orchestrated by Ahidjo.

In his remaining years, Ahidjo divided his time between France and Senegal. He died of a heart attack in Dakar on 30 November 1989 and was buried there. He was officially rehabilitated by a law in December 1991. Biya said on 30 October 2007 that the matter of returning Ahidjo&#x27;s remains to Cameroon was &quot;a family affair&quot;. An agreement on returning Ahidjo&#x27;s remains was reached in June 2009, and it was expected that they would be returned in 2010. However, as of 2021, Ahidjo remains in Dakar, buried alongside his wife, who died in April of that year.

==Criticism==

=== Sakamoto family murders ===
TBS was accused of failing to protect its sources in October 1989, when it taped an interview with Tsutsumi Sakamoto regarding his investigations into the Aum Shinrikyo sect. The network secretly showed a video of the interview to Aum members without Sakamoto&#x27;s knowledge. Aum officials then pressured TBS to cancel the planned broadcast of the interview, but Sakamoto, his wife and child were murdered by Aum members on 3 November.

<doc id="420775" wikidata="Q471364" url="?curid=420775" title="Dave Freudenthal">
<text>David Duane Freudenthal (born October 12, 1950) is an American attorney, economist, and politician who served as the 31st governor of Wyoming from 2003 to 2011. Freudenthal previously was the United States Attorney for the District of Wyoming from 1994 to 2001. As of 2025, he is the last Democrat to win and/or hold statewide office in Wyoming.

==Biography==
===Education and career===
Dave Freudenthal was born in Thermopolis, the seat of Hot Springs County in north central Wyoming, the seventh of eight children; he grew up on a farm north of town. Eventually, he graduated from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1973 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. After graduating, he got a job with the Department of Economic Planning and Development as an economist and later became the state planning director for Governor Edgar Herschler.

Freudenthal received his J.D. degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law in 1980 and went into private practice. After retiring as governor, Freudenthal briefly worked at the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring as senior counsel in the firm&#x27;s Cheyenne, Wyoming office before it closed.

===Political career===
In 1994, upon the recommendation of Governor Mike Sullivan, Freudenthal was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Wyoming. He left this post in May 2001 and was replaced by future governor Matt Mead.

==== Governors of Wyoming ====
In 2002, Freudenthal contested the Democratic primary for the gubernatorial election held later that year and won with over 50% of the vote against a field of opponents. He went on to be elected governor of Wyoming on November 5, 2002 with 50% of the vote. He ran for reelection on November 7, 2006, and improved his vote count to 70%, sweeping every county in the state. Freudenthal announced on March 4, 2010 that he would not attempt to seek a third term as governor after speculation he would push to repeal state law on term limits; that law limited governors to eight years in office during a 16-year period.

Freudenthal remained consistently popular with his constituents throughout his tenure, even though he was a Democrat in a state that had turned almost solidly Republican. As governor he often took rather conservative positions, leading to disagreements with federal officials and environmental groups. In fact, Freudenthal and his eventual Republican successor, Matt Mead, notably held similar positions on various issues. The majority of his two terms oversaw an enormous energy boom and surpluses in government revenue, although this was later reversed after the Great Recession; Freudenthal then called for cuts to state agencies as growth continued to slow. In June 2007, following the death of Republican U.S. Senator Craig Thomas, he appointed Republican John Barrasso to the United States Senate; state law required him to select an appointee from a shortlist compiled by the Wyoming Republican Party.

==Personal life==
Freudenthal is married to Nancy D. Freudenthal, a native of Cody, who serves as a judge on the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. They have four children: Donald, Hillary, Bret and Katie. His brother, Steve Freudenthal, served as Attorney General under Governor Edgar Herschler and was a member of the state House of Representatives. In 2008, while serving as Governor, Freudenthal underwent surgery on his shoulder; during this time Secretary of State Max Maxfield served as acting governor for a short time. He is an Episcopalian.

<doc id="420779" wikidata="Q725575" url="?curid=420779" title="Marc Racicot">
<text>Marc Racicot (; born July 24, 1948) is an American attorney, lobbyist, and former Republican politician who served as the 21st governor of Montana from 1993 until 2001. After leaving office, Racicot worked as a lobbyist for the law firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. His notable clients included Enron, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and the Recording Industry Association of America.

He was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2001 until 2003, when he was appointed as the chairman of the Bush re-election campaign. In 2000 as well as 2004 he was rumored to be Bush&#x27;s choice for United States Attorney General. During the 2000 election, some saw him as a possible running mate for Bush. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as &quot;one of Bush&#x27;s closest friends and advisers&quot;. Racicot has been harshly critical of Donald Trump, and endorsed Joe Biden over Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election. This led to the Montana Republican Party censuring him in 2023, and declaring that they no longer considered him a Republican.

==Early life and education==
Racicot was born in Thompson Falls, Montana. His ancestors came to the Montana Territory in the 1860s. Marc&#x27;s grandfather arrived in Libby, Montana, in 1917 to work as a logging camp cook in northwestern Montana for J. Neils Lumber Company. Marc Racicot was born to Bill and Pat Racicot on July 24, 1948. He was raised in Miles City, Montana, and Libby. His parents owned a foster home. His father was also a teacher, high school basketball coach, and track coach. He graduated from Libby High School. Racicot received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Carroll College in 1970. He was a starting basketball player in high school as well at Carroll College. He earned a J.D. degree in 1973 from the University of Montana School of Law in Missoula, Montana.

==Career==
Racicot had previously been an Army ROTC graduate. He attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps. He was immediately assigned as a prosecutor in the Army JAG Corps from 1973 to 1976. He was stationed in West Germany where he served as Chief Prosecutor for the largest U.S. military jurisdiction in Europe. While there, he also taught business and criminal law for the University of Maryland. After three years, he was discharged from the Army as a captain and returned to Montana in 1976.

He became the deputy county attorney for Missoula County from 1976 to 1977. After that, he became a special prosecutor for Montana statewide in 1977, and served in that position until 1988. During this time, he had a conviction rate of 95%. He lost only two cases in twelve years. He convicted Don and Dan Nichols, who both abducted Kari Swenson, an Olympic athlete, and murdered a would-be rescuer. In May 1985, Dan Nichols was sentenced to 20 years for kidnapping and assault. In September 1985, Don Nichols was sentenced to 85 years for kidnapping, murder, and aggravated assault. In 1980 he ran for chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful. He also ran for district judge in Lewis &amp; Clark County in 1982 and Broadwater County in 1984, but lost both elections.

Racicot was the special prosecutor in the 1984 murder trial of Barry Beach, who was convicted of killing teenager Kim Nees near Poplar, Montana, in 1979, at age 17, and was sentenced to life without parole. Beach maintains that he is innocent and that his confession was coerced, while Racicot is convinced of his guilt. Beach&#x27;s appeals were unsuccessful, with the Montana Supreme Court rejecting a bid to overturn his conviction by a 4–3 vote. Beach&#x27;s petitions for clemency to the state Board of Pardons and Parole were opposed by Racicot, but supported by other prominent Montanans, such as Jon Tester and Brian Schweitzer. At a clemency hearing, Racicot acknowledged that law enforcement had created a &quot;mess&quot; by contaminating the crime scene, but testified that Beach&#x27;s detailed confession was strong evidence of his guilt, and disputed the plausibility of alternate accounts of Nees&#x27; murder.
==Attorney General of Montana==
In 1988, he ran for Attorney General of Montana. He defeated Democratic nominee Mike McGrath, the Lewis and Clark County Attorney, 52%-48%. He served as attorney general until January 1993.

==Governor of Montana==

===Elections===
In 1992, incumbent Governor Stan Stephens declined to run due to health problems. Racicot decided to run and easily won the Republican primary by defeating Andy Bennett 69%-31%. He won every county in the state. He then competed with Democratic State Representative Dorothy Bradley of Bozeman. Both candidates called for a 4% sales tax, but differed on how to spend such a tax. Racicot defeated her 51%-49%, a difference of 10,980 votes.

In 1996, Racicot ran for re-election. He easily defeated Rob Natelson in the Republican primary, 76%-24%. He was challenged in the general election by long-time state State Senator Chet Blaylock. Polls showed that Racicot maintained a sizable lead over Blaylock during the campaign. A few weeks before the election however, Blaylock unexpectedly died of a heart attack on the way to a debate. Reluctantly, his little known running mate, Judy Jacobson continued the drive but had little time to launch her own campaign. Because the election was so near, the voting ballots could only be changed to show Jacobson running for both governor and lieutenant governor. In one of the largest margins in state history, Racicot defeated Jacobson, 79%–21%, winning every county in the state.

===Tenure===
As governor, Racicot was described as fiscally conservative and &quot;an advocate for deregulation and business interests&quot;. After working with the Montana State Legislature to eliminate the $200 million deficit in 1993, the Racicot Administration produced a $22.4 million budget surplus the year after. They used the surplus to cut taxes. He approved legislation that deregulated the utility sector in Montana. This legislation was sought by the Montana Power Company, the major utility supplier in the state. Following passage, the Montana Power Company divested itself of its utility operations and became a telecommunications company. The company filed for bankruptcy a few years later. The final result of this sweeping deregulation of Montana&#x27;s utilities was a drastic rise in rates for most of the power customers in Montana. Workers with pensions from Montana Power were suddenly left without income.

==Chairman of the RNC==
On December 5, 2001, President George W. Bush announced that he would appoint Racicot, a strong Bush ally, to become the chairman of the Republican National Committee. He was one of Bush&#x27;s earliest supporters and was a very effective spokesman for the Bush campaign in the recount debacle. In addition, Racicot was Bush&#x27;s first choice for U.S. Attorney General, but he took himself off the list for personal reasons. In order to be confirmed, he severed ties to lobbying organizations that were connected to Enron. On January 18, 2002, the 165-member RNC unanimously ratified Racicot.

Racicot was extremely successful as the Republican party performed very well in the 2002 midterm elections. Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate, making Bill Frist the Senate Majority Leader. In the wake of the McCain-Feingold finance reform, the RNC raised a record-$250 million in soft money.

In January 2003, he decided to resign to become chairman of Bush&#x27;s 2004 re-election campaign. Bush appointed Ed Gillespie as the next chairman of the RNC.

==2004 presidential election==

Racicot was the chairman of Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign from 2003 to 2004, the entire election cycle. He said of his job: &quot;I&#x27;m just a utility infielder.&quot; Racicot called Bush&#x27;s opponent, U.S. Senator John Kerry, &quot;out of the mainstream&quot; and dismissed all polls suggesting Kerry would win. He also said Kerry&#x27;s &quot;record on defense and intelligence funding is not defensible.&quot;

Bush won re-election to a second term, defeating Kerry 51%-48%.

==Later life and career==
Racicot was president of the American Insurance Association (AIA), an insurance industry lobbying group from June 13, 2005 to February 1, 2009.

He is a member of the board of directors of MassMutual, Weyerhaeuser and Jobs for America&#x27;s Graduates, He was formerly a member of the board of visitors for the University of Montana School of Law. He is also a past member of the board of directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service and United Way, and was a member of the Carroll College Board of Trustees.

He is a former partner at the Texas-based law firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani.

===Political views===
Racicot has criticized of the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; (2010), saying it has led to &quot;obscene&quot; levels of fundraising from &quot;third-party groups&quot;, and worsened American political discourse, alongside social media. 

Racicot has been a staunch critic of Donald Trump, whom he has called &quot;a scourge on America&quot;. During the 2016 election, he wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he said, &quot;Trump has demonstrated neither [...] qualities of principled leadership, nor offered any substantive or serious conservative policy proposals consistent with historical Republican Party platform positions&quot;. In 2020, he vocally supported Joe Biden over Trump. Racicot has refused to endorse Republican candidates who have backed Trump; in 2022, he declined to endorse Ryan Zinke, a former secretary of the interior under Trump, in his bid for the U.S. Congress, saying that he &quot;enable[d Trump]&quot;. In 2023, the Montana Republican State Central Committee passed a resolution rebuking Racicot, saying that they no longer considered him a Republican due to his opposition to Trump. In 2024, he endorsed Jon Tester over Trump-backed Tim Sheehy in the senate election. 

==Personal life==
Racicot lives in Missoula, Montana . He and his wife, Theresa, have five children.

==In Popular Culture==
In early April of 1996, Racicot gained national attention when he playfully sparred with host Jay Leno of The Tonight Show in a bid to rebut Montana&#x27;s new image as a refuge for criminals and kooks. Racicot was loose and wisecracking while recording a two-to-three-minute comedy segment with Leno from the governor&#x27;s office. He followed cue cards that set up responses from Leno in &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; studio. &quot;Every state has its positives and negatives, governor,&quot; Leno said in the working script. &quot;And to prove that, I thought you and I would compare the state of California with Montana.&quot; Racicot then made a series of comments about Montana, and Leno responded with comparisons to California. Among the back and forth:

Racicot: &quot;Montana, Big Sky Country.&quot;

Leno: &quot;California, brown sky country!&quot;

Racicot: &quot;Montana, where the deer and the antelope roam free.&quot;

Leno: &quot;California, where O.J. (Simpson) still roams free!&quot;

<text>Stanley Graham Stephens (September 16, 1929 – April 3, 2021) was a Canadian-American politician, journalist, and broadcaster who served as the 20th Governor of Montana from 1989 until 1993 as a member of the Republican Party.

==Biography==
Born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1929, Stephens was educated in public schools, but dropped out of high school. He moved to Montana when he was nineteen. He married Ann Hanson and the couple had two children.

==Career==
Stephens&#x27; 38-year career in broadcasting included his being drafted into service with the U.S. Armed Forces Broadcast Network during the Korean War. Stephens and Lyle Leeds, co-owners of KOJM Radio, in Havre, Montana, from 1953 to 1985, guided the station to a policy of fund-raisers and free air time to individuals to speak on issues. Developing the art of radio editorials, in 1975, Stephens earned the Edward R. Murrow award for journalistic excellence in editorials for uncovering a scandal in the Montana Workers&#x27; Compensation Program.

Stephens began his political career in 1969 with his election to the Montana State Senate and in his 16-year tenure, he served as floor whip, majority leader, and senate president. In 1986 Stephens was recognized by the National Republican Legislators&#x27; Association as one of the country&#x27;s ten most outstanding state lawmakers.

In 1988, when incumbent Governor of Montana Ted Schwinden declined to seek re-election to a third term, Stephens ran to succeed him. He narrowly won the Republican primary, and, in the general election, defeated former Governor Thomas Lee Judge by a slim margin. During his tenure as governor, he served on the White House Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Affairs, and he oversaw the 1989 Montana Statehood Centennial celebration. He declined to seek re-election in 1992, and was succeeded by Marc Racicot.

<text>Theodore Schwinden (August 31, 1925 – October 7, 2023) was an American politician from Montana. He was the 19th governor of Montana from 1981 to 1989. He had previously served as the 26st lieutenant governor of Montana and as a member of the Montana House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Theodore Schwinden was born in Roosevelt County, Montana, on his family&#x27;s farm on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation between Wolf Point and Poplar. Schwinden was a valedictorian at his high school. He enlisted in the United States Army and served in both the European and Pacific theaters in World War II. He left the army in 1946. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s from the University of Montana. He was studying toward a PhD in economics at the University of Minnesota before he had to return to his family farm due to his father&#x27;s ill health.

==Career==
A member of the Democratic Party, Schwinden was elected to the Montana House of Representatives in 1958, defeating Republican incumbent Chris S. Tange to represent Roosevelt County. Schwinden completed two terms in the House but was unsuccessful in his campaign for a third term. He was elected and named to the Legislative Council in 1959. He served as the House minority whip in 1961. In 1965, he was elected president of the Grain Growers Association. In 1969, he was named Commissioner of State Lands by governor Forrest H. Anderson. He was reappointed in 1973 and served until April 1976. Schwinden resigned to campaign for lieutenant governor and was elected the 23rd lieutenant governor of Montana, serving under Governor Thomas Lee Judge. He served as lieutenant governor from 1977 to 1981.

Schwinden defeated Judge in the Democratic primary in 1980. He then beat Republican Jack Ramirez in that year&#x27;s gubernatorial election to become the 19th governor of Montana. He was re-elected governor in 1984, getting the victory over State Senator Pat M. Goodover. Hallmarks of Schwinden&#x27;s governorship were his &quot;Build Montana&quot; economic plan and popular traveling &quot;Capital for a Day&quot; events, and was known for leading Montana through its economic difficulties. He took pride in being what he felt was a governor who maintained an open and attentive approach to the needs and concerns of the public. Despite favorable polling in 1988, he chose not to seek a third term as governor, staying true to his promise of serving only two terms in office.

==Personal life and death==
Schwinden married the former Jean Christianson in 1946. Schwinden and his wife had two sons, Mike Schwinden and Dore Schwinden, and one daughter, Chrys Anderson. Jean Schwinden died from cancer on March 24, 2007, at age 81.

In his later years, Schwinden lived with his daughter in Phoenix, Arizona. He died in Phoenix on October 7, 2023, at the age of 98.

<doc id="420787" wikidata="Q247670" url="?curid=420787" title="Pro Tools">
<text>Pro Tools is a digital audio workstation (DAW) developed and released by Avid Technology (formerly Digidesign) for Microsoft Windows and macOS. It is used for music creation and production, sound for picture (sound design, audio post-production and mixing) and, more generally, sound recording, editing, and mastering processes.

Pro Tools operates both as standalone software and in conjunction with a range of external analog-to-digital converters and PCIe cards with on-board digital signal processors (DSP). The DSP is used to provide additional processing power to the host computer for processing real-time effects, such as reverb, equalization, and compression and to obtain lower latency audio performance. Like all digital audio workstation software, Pro Tools can perform the functions of a multitrack tape recorder and a mixing console along with additional features that can only be performed in the digital domain, such as non-linear and non-destructive editing (most of audio handling is done without overwriting the source files), track compositing with multiple playlists, time compression and expansion, pitch shifting, and faster-than-real-time mixdown.

Audio, MIDI, and video tracks are graphically represented on a timeline. Audio effects, virtual instruments, and hardware emulators—such as microphone preamps or guitar amplifiers—can be added, adjusted, and processed in real-time in a virtual mixer. 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit float audio bit depths at sample rates up to 192 kHz are supported. Pro Tools supports mixed bit depths and audio formats in a session: BWF/WAV (including WAVE Extensible, RF64 and BW64) and AIFF. It imports and exports MOV video files and ADM BWF files (audio files with Dolby Atmos metadata); it also imports MXF, ACID and REX files and the lossy formats MP3, AAC, M4A, and audio from video files (MOV, MP4, M4V). The legacy SDII format was dropped with Pro Tools 10, although SDII conversion is still possible on macOS.

Pro Tools has incorporated video editing capabilities, so users can import and manipulate high-definition video file formats such as XDCAM, MJPG-A, PhotoJPG, DV25, QuickTime, and more. It features time code, tempo maps, elastic audio, and automation; supports mixing in surround sound, Dolby Atmos and VR sound using Ambisonics.

The Pro Tools TDM mix engine, supported until 2011 with version 10, employed 24-bit fixed-point arithmetic for plug-in processing and 48-bit for mixing. Current HDX hardware systems, HD Native and native systems use 32-bit floating-point resolution for plug-ins and 64-bit floating-point summing. The software and the audio engine were adapted to 64-bit architecture from version 11.

In 2022, Avid switched Pro Tools from a perpetual license to a subscription model. New users have to choose between three new plans: Pro Tools Artist, which costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year; Pro Tools Studio, which costs $39.99 per month or $299 per year; and Pro Tools Flex, which costs $99.99 per month or $999 per year. Later in 2022, Avid launched a free version: Pro Tools Intro.

In 2004, Pro Tools was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot;

==History==
=== The beginnings: Digidrums (1983–1985) ===
Pro Tools was developed by UC Berkeley graduates Evan Brooks, who majored in electrical engineering and computer science, and Peter Gotcher.

In 1983, the two friends, sharing an interest in music and electronic and software engineering, decided to study the memory mapping of the newly released E-mu Drumulator drum machine to create EPROM sound replacement chips. The Drumulator was quite popular at that time, although it was limited to its built-in samples.

They started selling the upgrade chips one year later under their new Digidrums label. Five different upgrade chips were available, offering different alternate drum styles. The chips, easily switchable with the original ones, enjoyed remarkable success between the Drumulator users, selling 60,000 units overall.

=== Digidesign Sound Designer (1985–1989) ===
When Apple released its first Macintosh computer in 1984, the pair thought to design a more functional and flexible solution which could take advantage of a graphical interface. In collaboration with E-Mu, they developed a Mac-based visual sample editing system for the Emulator II keyboard, called Sound Designer, released under the Digidesign brand and inspired by the interface of the Fairlight CMI. This system, the first ancestor of Pro Tools, was released in 1985 at the price of US$995.

Brooks and Gotcher rapidly ported Sound Designer to many other sampling keyboards, such as E-mu Emax, Akai S900, Sequential Prophet 2000, Korg DSS-1, and Ensoniq Mirage. Thanks to the universal file specification subsequently developed by Brooks with version 1.5, Sound Designer files could be transferred via MIDI between sampling keyboards of different manufacturers. This universal file specification, along with the printed source code to a 68000 assembly language interrupt-driven MIDI driver, was distributed through Macintosh MIDI interface manufacturer Assimilation, which manufactured the first MIDI interface for the Mac in 1985.

Starting from the same year, a dial-up service provided by Beaverton Digital Systems, called MacMusic, allowed Sound Designer users to download and install the entire Emulator II sound library to other less expensive samplers: sample libraries could be shared across different manufacturers platforms without copyright infringement. MacMusic contributed to Sound Designer&#x27;s success by leveraging both the universal file format and developing the first online sample file download site globally, many years before the World Wide Web use soared. The service used 2400-baud modems and 100 MB of disk space with Red Ryder host on a 1 MB Macintosh Plus.

With the release of Apple Macintosh II in 1987, which provided card slots, a hard disk, and more capable memory, Brooks and Gotcher saw the possibility to evolve Sound Designer into a featured digital audio workstation. They discussed with E-mu the opportunity of using the Emulator III as a platform for their updated software, but E-mu rejected this offer. Therefore, they decided to design both the software and the hardware autonomously. Motorola, which was working on its 56K series of digital signal processors, invited the two to participate in its development. Brooks designed a circuit board for the processor, then developed the software to make it work with Sound Designer. A beta version of the DSP was ready by December 1988.

=== Digidesign Sound Tools and Sound Designer II software (1989–1990) ===
The combination of the hardware and the software was called Sound Tools. Advertised as the &quot;first tapeless studio&quot;, it was presented on January 20, 1989, at the NAMM International Music &amp; Sound Expo. The system relied on a NuBus card called Sound Accelerator, equipped with one Motorola 56001 processor. The card provided 16-bit playback and 44.1/48 kHz recording through a two-channel A/D converter (AD In), while the DSP handled signal processing, which included a ten-band graphic equalizer, a parametric equalizer, time stretching with pitch preservation, fade-in/fade-out envelopes, and crossfades (&quot;merging&quot;) between two sound files.

Sound Tools was bundled with Sound Designer II software, which was, at this time, a simple mono or stereo audio editor running on Mac SE or Mac II; digital audio acquisition from DAT was also possible. A two-channel digital interface (DAT-I/O) with AES/EBU and S/PDIF connections was made available later in 1989, while the Pro I/O interface came out in 1990 with 18-bit converters.

The file format used by Sound Designer II (SDII) became eventually a standard for digital audio file exchange until the WAV file format took over a decade later. Since audio streaming and non-destructive editing were performed on hard drives, the software was still limited by their performance; densely edited tracks could cause glitches. However, the rapidly evolving computer technology allowed developments towards a multi-track sequencer.

=== Deck, Pro Tools, Sound Tools II and Pro Tools II (1990–1994) ===
The core engine and much of the user interface of the first iteration of Pro Tools was based on Deck. The software, published in 1990, was the first multi-track digital recorder based on a personal computer. It was developed by OSC, a small San Francisco company founded the same year, in conjunction with Digidesign and ran on Digidesign&#x27;s hardware. Deck could run four audio tracks with automation; MIDI sequencing was possible during playback and record, and one effect combination could be assigned to each audio track (2-band parametric equalizer, 1-band EQ with delay, 1-band EQ with chorus, delay with chorus).

The first Pro Tools system was launched on June 5, 1991. It was based on an adapted version of Deck (ProDeck) along with Digidesign&#x27;s new editing software, ProEdit, created by Mark Jeffery; Sound Designer II was still supplied for two-channel editing. Pro Tools relied on Digidesign&#x27;s Audiomedia card, mounting one Motorola 56001 processor with a clock rate of 22.58 MHz and offering two analog and two digital channels of I/O, and on the Sound Accelerator card. External synchronization with audio and video tape machines was possible with SMPTE timecode and the Video Slave drivers. The complete system was selling for US$6,000.

Sound Tools II was launched in 1992 with a new DSP card. Two interfaces were also released: Pro Master 20, providing 20-bit A/D conversion, and Audiomedia II, with improved digital converters and one Motorola 56001 processor running at 33.86 MHz.

In 1993, Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton, the OSC&#x27;s engineers who developed Deck, split from Digidesign to focus on releasing lower-cost multi-track software that would run on computers with no additional hardware. This software was known as Session (for stereo-only audio cards) and Session 8 (for multichannel audio interfaces) and was selling for US$399.

Peter Gotcher felt that the software needed a significant rewrite. Pro Tools II, the first software release fully developed by Digidesign, followed in the same year and addressed its predecessor&#x27;s weaknesses. The editor and the mixer were merged into a single Pro Tools application that utilized the Digidesign Audio Engine (DAE) created by Peter Richert. DAE was also provided as a separate application to favor hardware support from third-party developers, enabling the use of Pro Tools hardware and plug-ins on other DAWs.
 Selling more than 8,000 systems worldwide, Pro Tools II became the best-selling digital audio workstation.

=== Pro Tools II TDM: 16 tracks and real-time plug-ins (1994) ===
In 1994, Pro Tools 2.5 implemented Digidesign&#x27;s newly developed time-division multiplexing technology, which allowed routing of multiple digital audio streams between DSP cards. With TDM, up to four NuBus cards could be linked, obtaining a 16-track system, while multiple DSP-based plug-ins could be run simultaneously and in real-time. The wider bandwidth required to run the larger number of tracks was achieved with a SCSI expansion card developed by Grey Matter Response, called System Accelerator.

In the same year, Digidesign announced that it merged into the American multimedia company Avid, developer of the digital video editing platform Media Composer and one of Digidesign&#x27;s major customers (25% of Sound Accelerator and Audiomedia cards produced was being bought by Avid). The operation was finalized in 1995.

=== Pro Tools III: 48 tracks, DSP Farm cards and switch to PCI cards (1995–1997) ===
With a redesigned Disk I/O card, Pro Tools III was able to provide 16 tracks with a single NuBus card; the system could be expanded using TDM to up to three Disk I/O cards, achieving 48 tracks. DSP Farm cards were introduced to increase the processing power needed for a more extensive real-time audio processing; each card was equipped with three Motorola 56001 chips running at 40 MHz. Multiple DSP cards could be added for additional processing power; each card could handle the playback of 16 tracks. A dedicated SCSI card was still required to provide the required bandwidth to support multiple-card systems.

Along with Pro Tools III, Digidesign launched the 888 interface, with eight channels of analog and digital I/O, and the cheaper 882 interface. The Session 8 system included a control surface with eight faders. A series of TDM plug-ins were bundled with the software, including dynamics processing, EQ, delay, modulation, and reverb.

In 1996, following Apple&#x27;s decision to drop NuBus in favor of PCI bus, Digidesign added PCI support with Pro Tools 3.21. The PCI version of the Disk I/O card incorporated a high-speed SCSI along with DSP chips, while the upgraded DSP Farm PCI card included four Motorola 56002 chips running at 66 MHz.

This change of architecture allowed the convergence of Macintosh computers with Intel-based PCs, for which PCI had become the standard internal communication bus. With the PCI version of Digidesign&#x27;s Audiomedia card in 1997 (Audiomedia III), Sound Tools and Pro Tools could be run on Windows platforms for the first time.

=== 24-bit audio and surround mixing: Pro Tools | 24 and Pro Tools | 24 MIX (1997–2002) ===
With the release of Pro Tools | 24 in 1997, Digidesign introduced a new 24-bit interface (the 888|24) and a new PCI card (the d24). The d24 relied on Motorola 56301 processors, offering increased processing power and 24 tracks of 24-bit audio (later increased to 32 tracks with a DAE software update). A SCSI accelerator was required to keep up with the increased data throughput. Digidesign dropped its proprietary SCSI controller in favor of commercially available ones.

64 tracks with dual d24 support were introduced with Pro Tools 4.1.1 in 1998, while the updated Pro Tools | 24 MIX system provided three times more DSP power with the MIX Core DSP cards. MIXplus systems combined a MIX Core with a MIX Farm, obtaining a performance increase of 700% compared to a Pro Tools | 24 system.

Pro Tools 5 saw two substantial software developments: extended MIDI functionality and integration in 1999 (an editable piano-roll view in the editor; MIDI automation, quantize and transpose) and the introduction of surround sound mixing and multichannel plug-ins—up to the 7.1 format—with Pro Tools TDM 5.1 in 2001.

The migration from traditional, tape-based analog studio technology to the Pro Tools platform took place within the industry: Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; (1999) was the first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single to be recorded, edited, and mixed entirely within the Pro Tools environment, allowing a more meticulous and effortless editing workflow (especially on vocals).

While consolidating its presence in professional studios, Digidesign began to target the mid-range consumer market in 1999 by introducing the Digi001 bundle, consisting of a rack-mount audio interface with eight inputs and outputs with 24-bit, 44.1/48 kHz capability and MIDI connections. The package was distributed with Pro Tools LE, a specific version of the software without DSP support, limited to 24 mixing tracks.

=== High-resolution audio and consolidation of digital recording and mixing: Pro Tools | HD (2002–2011) ===
Following the launch of Mac OS X operating system in 2001, Digidesign made a substantial redesign of Pro Tools hardware and software. Pro Tools | HD was launched in 2002, replacing the Pro Tools | 24 system and relying on a new range of DSP cards (HD Core and HD Process, replacing MIX Core and MIX Farm), new interfaces running at up to 192 kHz or 96 kHz sample rates (HD 192 and 96, replacing 888 and 882), along with an updated version of the software (Pro Tools 6) with new features and a redesigned GUI, developed for OS X and Windows XP. Two HD interfaces could be linked together for increased I/O through a proprietary connection. The base system was selling for US$12,000, while the full system was selling for US$20,000.

Both HD Core and Process cards mounted nine Motorola 56361 chips running at 100 MHz, each providing 25% more processing power than the Motorola 56301 chips mounted on MIX cards; this translated to about twice the power for a single card. A system could combine one HD Core card with up to two HD Process cards, supporting playback for 96/48/12 tracks at 48/96/192 kHz sample rates (with a single HD Core card installed) and 128/64/24 tracks at 48/96/192 kHz sample rates (with one or two HD Process cards).

When Apple changed the expansion slot architecture of the Mac G5 to PCI Express, Digidesign launched a line of PCIe DSP cards that both adopted the new card slot format and slightly changed the combination of chips. HD Process cards were replaced with HD Accel, each mounting nine Motorola 56321 chips running at 200 MHz and each providing twice the power than an HD Process card; track count for systems mounting an HD Accel was extended to 192/96/36 tracks at 48/96/192 kHz sample rates. The use of PCI Express connection reduced round-trip delay time, while DSP audio processing allowed the use of smaller hardware buffer sizes during recording, assuring stable performance with extremely low latency.

Pro Tools, offering a solid and reliable alternative to analog recording and mixing, eventually became a standard in professional studios throughout the decade, while editing features such as Beat Detective (introduced with Pro Tools 5.1 in 2001) and Elastic Audio (introduced with Pro Tools 7.4 in 2007) redefined the workflow adopted in contemporary music production.

Other software milestones were background tasks processing (such as fade rendering, file conversion or relinking), real-time insertion of TDM plug-ins during playback, and a browser/database environment introduced with Pro Tools 6 in 2003; Automatic plug-in Delay Compensation (ADC), introduced with Pro Tools 6.4 in 2004 and only available with TDM systems with HD Accel; a new implementation of RTAS with multi-threading support and improved performance, Region groups, Instrument tracks, and real-time MIDI processing, introduced with Pro Tools 7 in 2006; VCA and volume trim, introduced with Pro Tools 7.2 in 2006; support for ten track inserts, MIDI Editor, and MIDI Score, introduced with Pro Tools 8 in 2009.

Pro Tools | MIX hardware support was dropped with version 6.4.1.

==== Native systems: Pro Tools LE and Pro Tools ====
Pro Tools LE, first introduced and distributed in 1999 with the Digi 001 interface, was a specific Pro Tools version in which the signal processing entirely relied on the host CPU. The software required a Digidesign interface to run, which acted as a copy-protection mechanism for the software. Mbox was the entry-level range of the available interface; Digi 001 and Digi 002/003, which also provided a control surface, were the upper range. The Eleven Rack also ran on Pro Tools LE, included in-box DSP processing via an FPGA chip, offloading guitar amp/speaker emulation, and guitar effects plug-in processing to the interface, allowing them to run without taxing the host system.

Pro Tools LE shared the same interface of Pro Tools HD but had a smaller track count (24 tracks with Pro Tools 5, extended to 32 tracks with Pro Tools 6 and 48 tracks with Pro Tools 8) and supported a maximum sample rate of 96 kHz (depending on the interface used). Some advanced software features, such as Automatic Delay Compensation, surround mixing, multi-track Beat Detective, OMF/AAF support, and SMPTE Timecode, were omitted. Some of them, as well as support for 48 tracks/96 voices (extended to 64 tracks/128 voices with Pro Tools 8) and additional plug-ins, were made available through an expansion package called &quot;Music Production Toolkit&quot;. The &quot;Complete Production Toolkit&quot;, introduced with Pro Tools 8, added support for surround mixing and 128 tracks (while the system was still limited to 128 voices).

With the acquisition of M-Audio in 2004–2005, Digidesign released a specific variant of Pro Tools, called , which was equivalent to Pro Tools LE and could be run with M-Audio interfaces.

The Pro Tools LE/ line was discontinued with the release of Pro Tools 9.

==== Hardware-independent native systems: Pro Tools 9 ====
Pro Tools 9, released in November 2010, dropped the requirement of proprietary hardware to run the software. Any audio device could be used through Core Audio on macOS or the ASIO driver on a Windows. Core Audio allowed device aggregation, enabling using of more than one interface simultaneously. Some Pro Tools HD software features, such as automatic plug-in delay compensation, OMF/AAF file import, Timecode ruler, and multi-track Beat Detective, were included in the standard version of Pro Tools 9.

When operating on a machine containing one or more HD Core, Accel, or Native cards, the software ran as Pro Tools HD with the complete HD feature set. In all other cases, it ran as Pro Tools 9 standard, with a smaller track count and some advanced features turned off.

====Advanced Instrument Research (AIR): built-in virtual instruments and plug-ins====
In response to Apple&#x27;s decision to include Emagic&#x27;s complete line of virtual instruments in Logic Pro in 2004 and following Avid&#x27;s acquisition of German virtual instruments developer Wizoo in 2005, Pro Tools 8 was supplied with its first built-in virtual instruments library, the AIR Creative Collection, as well as with some new plug-ins, to make it more appealing for music production. An expansion was also available, called AIR Complete Collection.
===Pro Tools | HDX (2011–present)===
In October 2011, Avid introduced Pro Tools 10 and a new series of DSP PCIe cards named HDX. Each card mounted 18 DSP processors, manufactured by Texas Instruments, allowing an increased computational precision (32-bit floating-point resolution for audio processing and 64-bit floating-point summing, versus the previous 24-bit and 48-bit fixed-point resolution of the TDM engine), thus improving dynamic range performance. Signal processing could be run on the embedded DSP, providing additional computational power and enabling near zero-latency for DSP-reliant plug-ins. Two FPGA chips handled track playback, monitoring, and internal routing, providing a lower round trip latency.

A second line of PCIe cards, called HD Native, provided low latency with a single FPGA chip but did not mount DSP (audio processing relied on the host system&#x27;s CPU). Round trip latency at 96 kHz was 0.7 ms for HDX and 1.7 ms for HD Native (with a 64-sample buffer).

To maintain performance consistency, HDX products were specified with a fixed maximum number of voices (each voice representing a monophonic channel). Each HDX card enabled 256 simultaneous voices at 44.1/48 kHz; voice count halved when the sample rate doubled (128 voices at 88.2/96 kHz, 64 voices at 176.4/192 kHz). Up to three HDX cards could be installed on a single system for a maximum of 768/384/192 total voices and for increased processing power. On Native systems, voice count was limited to 96/48/24 voices with the standard version of Pro Tools and 256/128/64 voices with Pro Tools HD software.

With Pro Tools 10, Avid deployed a new plug-in format for both Native and HDX systems called AAX (an acronym for Avid Audio eXtension). AAX Native replaced RTAS plug-ins and AAX DSP, a specific format running on HDX systems, replaced TDM plug-ins. AAX was developed to provide the future implementation of 64-bit plug-ins, although 32-bit versions of AAX were still used in Pro Tools 10. TDM support was dropped with HDX, while Pro Tools 10 would be the final release for Pro Tools | HD Process and Accel systems.

Notable software features introduced with Pro Tools 10 were editable clip-based gain automation (Clip gain), the ability to load the session&#x27;s audio data into RAM to improve transport responsiveness (Disk caching), quadrupled Automatic Delay Compensation length, audio fades processed in real-time, timeline length extended to 24 hours, support for 32-bit float audio and mixed audio formats within the session, and the addition of Avid Channel Strip plug-in (based on Euphonix System 5 console&#x27;s channel strip, following Avid&#x27;s acquisition of Euphonix in 2010).

=== Switch to 64-bit architecture (2013) ===
Pro Tools 11, released in June 2013, switched from 32-bit to 64-bit software architecture with new audio and video engines, enabling the application and plug-ins to fully take advantage of system memory. The new audio engine (AAE) introduced support of offline bouncing and simultaneous mixdowns multiple sources; dynamic plug-in processing allowed to reduce CPU usage when active native plug-ins do not receive any input. Two separate buffers were used for playback and for monitoring of record-enabled or input-monitored tracks. The new video engine (AVE) improved performance and handling of multiple CPU cores.

Support for HD Accel systems, legacy HD interfaces, TDM and 32-bit AAX plug-ins was dropped due to their incompatibility with 64-bit architecture. A free starter edition providing the essential features of Pro Tools, called &quot;First&quot;, was launched in 2015 and discontinued in December 2021 for being &quot;unviable to continue on a technical level&quot;.

==Features==

Pro Tools workflow is organized into two main windows: the timeline is shown in the Edit window, while the mixer is shown in the Mix window. MIDI and Score Editor windows provide a dedicated environment to edit MIDI. Different window layouts, along with shown and hidden tracks and their width settings, can be stored and recalled from the Window configuration list.

=== Timeline ===
The timeline provides a graphical representation of all types of tracks: the audio envelope or waveform (when zoomed in) for audio tracks, a piano roll showing MIDI notes and controller values for MIDI and Instrument tracks, a sequence of frame thumbnails for video tracks, audio levels for auxiliary, master and VCA master tracks. Alternate audio and MIDI content can be recorded, shown, and edited in multiple layers for each track (called playlists), which can be used for track compositing. All the mixer parameters (such as track and sends volume, pan, and mute status) and plug-in parameters can be changed over time through automation. Any automation type can be shown and edited in multiple lanes for each track. Track-based volume automation can be converted to clip-based automation and vice versa; automation of any type can also be copied and pasted to any other automation type.

Time can be measured and displayed on the timeline in different scales: bars and beats, time or SMPTE timecode (with selectable frame rates), audio samples, or film stock feet for audio-for-film referencing (based on the 35 mm film format). Tempo and meter changes can also be programmed; both MIDI and audio clips can move or time-stretch to follow tempo changes (&quot;tick-based&quot; tracks) or maintain their absolute position (&quot;sample-based&quot; tracks). Elastic Audio must be enabled to allow time stretching of audio clips.

=== Editing ===
Audio and MIDI clips can be moved, cut, and duplicated non-destructively on the timeline (edits change the clip organization on the timeline, but source files are not overwritten). Time stretching (TCE), pitch shifting, equalization, and dynamics processing can be applied to audio clips non-destructively and in real-time with Elastic Audio and Clip Effects; gain can be adjusted statically or dynamically on individual clips with Clip Gain; fade and crossfades can be applied, adjusted and are processed in real-time. All other types of audio processing can be rendered on the timeline with the AudioSuite (non-real-time) version of AAX plug-ins. Audio clips can be converted to MIDI data using the Celemony Melodyne engine; pitches with timing and velocities are extracted through melodic, polyphonic, or rhythmic analysis algorithms. Pitch and rhythm of audio tracks can also be viewed and manipulated with the bundled Melodyne Essential.

MIDI notes, velocities, and controllers can be edited directly on the timeline, each MIDI track showing an individual piano roll, or in a specific window, where several MIDI and Instrument tracks can be shown together in a single piano roll with color-coding. Multiple MIDI controllers for each track can be viewed and edited on different lanes. MIDI tracks can also be shown in musical notation within a score editor. MIDI data such as note quantization, duration, transposition, delay, and velocity can also be altered non-destructively and in real-time on a track-per-track basis.

Video files can be imported to one or more video tracks and organized in multiple playlists. Multiple video files can be edited together and played back in real-time. Video processing is GPU-accelerated and managed by the Avid Video Engine (AVE). Video output from one video track is provided in a separate window or can be viewed full screen.

=== Mixing ===
The virtual mixer shows controls and components of all tracks, including inserts, sends, input and output assignments, automation read/write controls, panning, solo/mute buttons, arm record buttons, the volume fader, the level meter, and the track name. It also can show additional controls for the inserted virtual instrument, mic preamp gain, HEAT settings, and the EQ curve of supported plug-ins. Each track inputs and outputs can have different channel depths: mono, stereo, multichannel (LCR, LCRS, Quad, 5.0/5.1, 6.0/6.1, 7.0/7.1); Dolby Atmos and Ambisonics formats are also available for mixing.

Audio can be routed to and from different outputs and inputs, both physical and internal. Internal routing is achieved using busses and auxiliary tracks; each track can have multiple output assignments. Virtual instruments are loaded on Instrument tracks—a specific type of track that receives MIDI data in input and returns audio in output.

Plug-ins are processed in real-time with dedicated DSP chips (AAX DSP format) or using the host computer&#x27;s CPU (AAX Native format).

==== Track rendering ====
Audio, auxiliary, and Instrument tracks (or MIDI tracks routed to a virtual instrument plug-in) can be committed to new tracks containing their rendered output. Virtual instruments can be committed to audio to prepare an arrangement project for mixing; track commit is also used to free up system resources during mixing or when the session is shared with systems not having some plug-ins installed. Multiple tracks can be rendered at a time; it is also possible to render a specific timeline selection and define which range of inserts to render.

Similarly, tracks can be frozen with their output rendered at the end of the plug-in chain or at a specific insert of their chain. Editing is suspended on frozen tracks, but they can subsequently be unfrozen if further adjustments are needed. For example, virtual instruments can be frozen to free up system memory and improve performance while keeping the possibility to unfreeze them to make arrangement changes.

==== Mixdown ====
The main mix of the session—or any internal mix bus or output path—can be bounced to disk in real-time (if hardware inserts from analog hardware are used, or if any audio or MIDI source is monitored live into the session) or offline (faster-than-real-time). The selected source can be mixed to mono, stereo, or any other multichannel format. Multichannel mixdowns can be written as an interleaved audio file or in multiple mono files. Up to 24 sources of up to 10 channels each can be mixed down simultaneously—for example, to deliver audio stems.

Audio and video can be bounced together to a MOV file; video is transcoded with the DNxHD, DNxHR, Apple ProRes, and H.264 video codecs.

=== Session data exchange ===
Session data can be partially or entirely exchanged with other DAWs or video editing software that support AAF, OMF, or MXF. AAF and OMF sequences embed audio and video files with their metadata; when opened by the destination application, session structure is rebuilt with the original clip placement, edits, and basic track and clip automation.

Track contents and any of its properties can be selectively exchanged between Pro Tools sessions with Import Session Data (for example, importing audio clips from an external session to a designated track while keeping track settings or importing track inserts while keeping audio clips). Similarly, the same track data for any track set—a given processing chain, a collection of clips, or a group of tracks with their assignments—can be stored and recalled as Track Presets.

=== Cloud collaboration ===
Pro Tools projects can be synchronized to the Avid Cloud and shared with other users on a track-by-track basis. Different users can simultaneously work on the project and upload new tracks or any changes to existing tracks (such as audio and MIDI clips, automation, inserted plug-ins, and mixer status) or alterations to the project structure (such as tempo, meter, or key).

=== Field recorder workflows ===
Pro Tools reads embedded metadata in media files to manage multichannel recordings made by field recorders in production sound. All stored metadata (such as scene and take numbers, tape or sound roll name, or production comments) can be accessed in the Workspace browser.

Analogous audio clips are identified by overlapping longitudinal timecode (LTC) and by one or more user-defined criteria (such as matching file length, file name, or scene and take numbers). An audio segment can be replaced from matching channels (for example, to replace audio from a boom microphone with the audio from a lavalier microphone) while maintaining edits and fades in the timeline, or any matching channels can be added to new tracks.

=== Multi-system linking and device synchronization ===
Up to twelve Pro Tools Ultimate systems with dedicated hardware can be linked together over an Ethernet network—for example, in multi-user mixing environments where different mix components (such as dialog, ADR, effects, and music) reside on different systems, or if a larger track count or processing power is needed. Transport, solo, and mute are controlled by a single system and with a single control surface. One system can also be designated for video playback to optimize performance. Pro Tools can synchronize to external devices using SMPTE/EBU timecode or MIDI timecode.

== Editions ==
Pro Tools software is available in three subscription-based paid versions (Artist, Studio and Ultimate) and one free version (Intro).

Before 2022, two different perpetual licenses could be purchased: a standard edition for US$599 (informally called &quot;Vanilla&quot;), which provided all the key features for audio mixing and post-production, and a complete edition for US$2599 (officially called &quot;Ultimate&quot; and known as &quot;HD&quot; between 2002 and 2018), which unlocked functionality for advanced workflows and a higher track count.

== Control surfaces ==
In the mid-1990s, Digidesign started working on a studio device that could replace classic analog consoles and provide integration with Pro Tools. ProControl (1998) was the first Digidesign control surface, providing motorized, touch-sensitive faders, an analog control room communication section, and connecting to the host computer via Ethernet. ProControl could be later expanded by adding up to five fader packs, each providing eight additional fader strips and controls.

Control 24 (2001) added 5.1 monitoring support and included 16 class A preamps designed by Focusrite. Icon D-Control (2004) incorporated an HD Accel system and was developed for larger TV and film productions in mind. Command|8 (2004) and D-Command (2005) were the smaller counterparts of Control 24 and D-Control, connected with the host computer via USB; Venue (2005) was a similar system specifically designed for live sound applications.

C|24 (2007) was a revision of Control 24 with improved preamps, while Icon D-Control ES (2008) and Icon D-Command ES (2009) were redesigns of Icon D-Control and D-Command.

In 2010 Avid acquired Euphonix, manufacturer of the Artist Series, and System 5 control surfaces. They were integrated with Pro Tools along with the EuCon protocols. Avid S6 (2013) and Avid S3 (2014) control surfaces followed by merging the Icon and System 5 series. Pro Tools Dock (2015) was an iPad-based control surface running Pro Tools Control software.

<doc id="420788" wikidata="Q623921" url="?curid=420788" title="Drowning Pool">
<text>Drowning Pool is an American rock band formed in Dallas, Texas, in 1996. The band was named after the 1975 film &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;. Since its formation, the band has consisted of guitarist C.J. Pierce, drummer Mike Luce and bassist Stevie Benton, as well as a revolving cast of vocalists.

After the release of their debut album, &quot;Sinner&quot; (2001), original vocalist Dave Williams was found dead on August 14, 2002, from heart disease. Jason Jones, who replaced Williams in 2003, recorded one album, &quot;Desensitized&quot; (2004), but left in 2005 due to musical differences. Ryan McCombs of band SOiL, later replaced Jones and released two albums, &quot;Full Circle&quot; (2007) and &quot;Drowning Pool&quot; (2010), making it the first time Drowning Pool had not switched singers after just one album. However, McCombs left the band in 2011 to rejoin SOiL. Jasen Moreno was announced as McCombs&#x27; replacement in 2012, and the band has recorded three albums with him: &quot;Resilience&quot; (2013), &quot;Hellelujah&quot; (2016) and &quot;Strike a Nerve&quot; (2022). The band continued performing with Moreno until McCombs returned in March 2023.

==History==
===Early years (1996–2000)===
Drowning Pool formed in Dallas, Texas, in 1996. Guitarist C.J. Pierce and drummer Mike Luce formed Drowning Pool after relocating from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Dallas. There, they found and recruited bassist Stevie Benton. For a few years they stuck to performing as an instrumental trio, but this all changed in 1999 with the arrival of vocalist Dave Williams. After recording a demo, Drowning Pool hooked up with Sevendust which got Drowning Pool in touch with Hed PE and Kittie. After touring with these bands, Drowning Pool got their demos enough radio play to get signed by Wind-up Records. The band made music with producer Jay Baumgardner.

===&quot;Sinner&quot;, death of Dave Williams, and &quot;Desensitized&quot; (2001–2005)===
Drowning Pool rose to fame with their debut album and played at the Ozzfest in 2001. Their 2001 debut album &quot;Sinner&quot; was certified platinum within six weeks. A number of songs from the album were featured at various WWE events that year, and three tracks would be included on the soundtrack for the Funimation dub of Dragon Ball Z: Cooler&#x27;s Revenge in early 2002.

On August 14 that year, Dave Williams was found dead inside his tour bus. He died from an undiagnosed heart condition, now known to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. When asked if the band had any unreleased songs, according to a 2002 Blabbermouth article, drummer Mike Luce replied that &quot;only 3-4 songs were done, including one called &quot;Heroes,&quot; which is a tribute to dead rock musicians such as Layne Staley. I don&#x27;t know if we will ever release them.&quot;

In 2003, Jason &#x27;Gong&#x27; Jones replaced Williams as Drowning Pool&#x27;s vocalist and the band released the album &quot;Desensitized&quot; in 2004. Despite the success of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Step Up&quot;, the album was not nearly as successful as &quot;Sinner&quot;, and it was publicly announced on June 14, 2005, that Jones had departed from the band, due to &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;.

===&quot;Full Circle&quot; (2006–2008)===

The band announced that their replacement singer would be formally announced at Ozzfest in Dallas, where the band did a one-off performance on the main stage. On July 20, 2005, the website SMNNews revealed that Ryan McCombs, then former singer of SOiL, was the new vocalist. The band initially wanted McCombs to join Drowning Pool as the replacement of Dave Williams, nearly two years prior. In spring of 2006, the band announced that they had parted ways with Wind-up Records. In October 2006, a new song &quot;No More&quot; was announced to be released on the &quot;Saw III&quot; soundtrack, their first song (besides a re-recorded version of &quot;Rise Up&quot;) with McCombs. The bands recorded version of &quot;Rise Up&quot;, was used as the theme song for WWE SmackDown from September 30, 2004 – September 26, 2008. The band signed a new deal with Eleven Seven Music and also announced a new management company, Tenth Street Entertainment. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Full Circle&quot;, was released on August 7, 2007. Two songs on the album were produced by Funny Farm Records, owned by Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx and former Beautiful Creatures guitarist DJ Ashba. The remaining songs were produced by Ben Schigel at the Ohio-based Spider Studios. The band then toured with Saliva in North America and also Sick Puppies and Seether in support of the album.

===&quot;Drowning Pool&quot; and departure of Ryan McCombs (2009–2011)===
Later in the year, work on a fourth album was announced. On March 3, 2009, the band released a live album, &quot;Loudest Common Denominator&quot;, which featured acoustic versions of &quot;Shame&quot; and &quot;37 Stitches&quot; from &quot;Full Circle&quot;. The band finished recording their self-titled album with producer Kato Khandwala at House of Loud in New Jersey. It was the first studio album in the band&#x27;s history not to feature a change of vocalist from the preceding album. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Feel Like I Do&quot;, was released as a free download on their official website, and the album was released on April 27, 2010. On November 7, 2011, C.J. Pierce and Mike Luce announced a new project with former Nonpoint members Zach Broderick and Ken McMillan titled Voodoo Corps. In November 2011, McCombs left the band to reunite with SOiL for touring and a new album. The band, now once again without a singer, began writing new material for a fifth studio album while holding vocalist auditions.

===&quot;Resilience&quot; and &quot;Hellelujah&quot; (2012–2016)===

In July 2012, Jasen Moreno, from The Suicide Hook, was announced to be the band&#x27;s new vocalist. On August 14, the 10th anniversary of Dave Williams&#x27; death, the band released a song in tribute of him, their first with Moreno titled &quot;In Memory Of...&quot;. Two further singles were released with Moreno, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; in November 2012, and &quot;One Finger and a Fist&quot; in December 2012, before the band released their fifth album, &quot;Resilience&quot;, on April 9, 2013. On September 10, the band announced that they would celebrate the thirteenth anniversary of &quot;Sinner&quot; with a U.S. tour starting from October 22, in which they plan to dig deep into the songs from their debut album. Drowning Pool released a reissue of their album &quot;Sinner&quot; called the &quot;Unlucky 13th Anniversary Edition&quot; in 2014.

The band signed to eOne Music in August 2015. On October 13, it was announced the band&#x27;s sixth album titled &quot;Hellelujah&quot; would be released January 22, 2016, via eOne Music with producer Jason Suecof; the date was later postponed to February 5. &quot;By the Blood&quot; was released as the first single from the album.

On May 17, 2016, the band announced that they would be taking part in the Make America Rock Again super tour on select dates throughout the summer and fall 2016. The tour featured other artists who had success throughout the 2000s, including Trapt, Saliva, Saving Abel, Crazy Town, 12 Stones and Tantric, Fuel, Puddle Of Mudd and P.O.D.

===&quot;Strike a Nerve&quot; (2017–2023)===
In December 2017, it was reported that Drowning Pool had begun writing their seventh studio album. In an interview with 97.1 The Eagle, guitarist C.J. Pierce stated, &quot;We&#x27;re working on new songs right now, which is awesome. We&#x27;re working on tunes for the next record. We have a bunch of stuff on the plate. Everybody&#x27;s brought amazing stuff, material. The thing with this is just to try and go through and see what we&#x27;re gonna do on the next record. So we&#x27;ll hash out all the ideas and songs and then start narrowing it down. So it&#x27;s nice to have more than enough to go through.&quot; The band began recording their new album in February 2019. Within the next three years, there had been no news regarding the state of the album. On February 16, 2022, Drowning Pool announced &quot;Strike a Nerve&quot; as the name of their seventh studio album, which had already been completed by early 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant that its release date was then postponed.

Prior to the release of &quot;Strike a Nerve&quot;, Drowning Pool embarked on the North American tour Brothers in Arms with Ill Niño and (hed)p.e. in early 2022, and during this tour, they played two tracks from the upcoming album: &quot;Strike a Nerve&quot; and &quot;Hate Against Hate&quot;. On August 5, 2022, the band announced the album would be released on September 30.

===Reunion with Ryan McCombs (2023–present)===
On March 16, 2023, Drowning Pool announced that Ryan McCombs (while continuing his vocal duties with SOiL) had rejoined the band after a 12-year absence. Although they had planned to release new music with McCombs before the end of 2023, the year ended without any.

Drowning Pool released their first song with McCombs in 14 years, &quot;Revolution (The Final Amen)&quot;, on September 20, 2024. The band also plans to release a new album in 2025.

==Controversy and military&#x27;s use of &quot;Bodies&quot;==
The band has faced some controversies and criticism due to the alleged misinterpretation of the lyrics to their most well-known song &quot;Bodies&quot;. In 2011, the song was associated with the assassination attempt of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Shortly after the shooting, the band made a statement addressing the link: &quot;We were devastated this weekend to learn of the tragic events that occurred in Arizona and that our music has been misinterpreted. &#x27;Bodies&#x27; was written about the brotherhood of the moshpit and was never about violence.&quot; The band also added: &quot;For someone to put out a video misinterpreting a song about a moshpit as fuel for a violent act shows just how sick they really are. We support those who do what they can to keep America safe. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families of this terrible tragedy&quot;.

&quot;Bodies&quot; was used consistently by interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps in 2003, and was consistently played over a 10-day period in 2006 during interrogations of Mohamedou Ould Slahi while he was &quot;exposed to variable lighting patterns&quot; at the same time.

==Musical style and influences==
Drowning Pool&#x27;s style has been considered alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, and post-grunge, as well as being part of the new wave of American heavy metal. The band&#x27;s influences include Metallica, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Anthrax, Testament, Slipknot, Alice in Chains, SOiL, Opeth, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Black Sabbath, Slayer, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Mötley Crüe, the Beatles, Pantera, Sepultura and Suicidal Tendencies.

<doc id="420790" wikidata="Q449719" url="?curid=420790" title="Judy Martz">
<text>Judith Helen Martz (née Morstein; July 28, 1943 – October 30, 2017) was an American politician, businesswoman, and Olympian speed skater who served as the 22nd governor of Montana from 2001 to 2005. A member of the Republican Party, she was the first, and as of 2025, the only woman to hold the office. She previously served as the 31st Lieutenant Governor of Montana from 1997 to 2001 under the governorship of Marc Racicot.

==Early life and education==
Martz was born July 28, 1943, in Big Timber, Montana, as Judith Helen Morstein. Her father was a miner and rancher, and her mother was, at various times, a cook, liquor-store clerk and motel maid. Morstein graduated from Butte High School in 1961 and attended Eastern Montana College.

==Career==
Morstein was named Miss Rodeo Montana in 1962. She competed on the U.S. women&#x27;s speed skating team at the 1964 Winter Olympics (1500 meters). She was one of the first two Montana women to appear in the Olympics.

Morstein married Harry Martz in 1965; she and her husband owned and operated a garbage disposal service in Butte, Montana.

Martz helped to establish the U.S. High Altitude Speed Skating Center in Butte. She also worked as a field representative for Republican U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns from 1989 to 1995.

Gov. Marc Racicot appointed Martz as lieutenant governor of Montana in 1995 after her predecessor, Denny Rehberg, stepped down to run for U.S. Senate. Martz was the first female lieutenant governor in the state&#x27;s history. In 1996, Martz was elected lieutenant governor as Racicot&#x27;s running mate.

=== Governor of Montana ===

====2000 Montana gubernatorial election====
In the Montana gubernatorial election of 2000, Martz won the Republican primary over conservative activist and University of Montana law professor Rob Natelson 57 percent to 43 percent. She went on to defeat her Democratic opponent, State Auditor Mark O&#x27;Keefe, in the general election by a margin of 51 percent to 47 percent despite being outspent by a three-to-one margin. Martz&#x27;s running mate was Karl Ohs.

====Tenure (2001–2005)====
Martz was Montana&#x27;s first female governor.

Martz &quot;was noted for turning a state deficit into a surplus while reducing taxes and increasing funding for education. However, her term was besieged by missteps. Her popularity dropped to 20 percent at its low point&quot;.

In August 2001, the Montana Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint alleging that Martz violated state law by buying land from Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco) in 1999 at a much lower price than Arco had paid for the property two years earlier. Following a hearing, the political practices commissioner issued a September 2002 decision clearing Martz.

Martz&#x27;s chief policy adviser, Shane Hedges, was involved in an automobile accident near Marysville, Montana, in August 2001. Hedges was driving while intoxicated. Following the accident, Hedges went to Martz&#x27;s residence, where she washed his clothes. House Majority Leader Paul Sliter died in the crash. Hedges promptly resigned and pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent homicide.

Martz announced that she would not run for re-election as governor in 2004. She finished her time in office campaigning for President Bush in Ohio, Arizona, and other swing states, and sparring with incoming Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer over the state government transition.

===Later career===
In September 2005, Martz was named chair of Montanans for Judge Roberts, a group supportive of Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, and spoke at a rally in support of Roberts. She also sat on the boards of Maternal Life International, University of Montana Western, Big Sky State Games, and TASER International, a company that manufacturers non-lethal electrical shock equipment for law enforcement, the military, and private individuals.

After leaving office, Martz &quot;routinely addressed Christian organizations throughout the country and was part of a network that prays at locations across Montana&quot;.

==Personal life==
Martz and her husband, Harry, were married in 1965. They had two children: Justin and Stacey Jo. Martz was a Christian.

In May 2003, Martz was referenced in news for a perceived similarity to the face and hair of a nude bordello dancer sculpted by Seattle artist Kristine Veith, and placed in a new development in downtown Helena. Both Martz and Veith denied the similarity, with Martz stating, possibly partially tongue-in-cheek, &quot;I&#x27;m a very modest person, no one would ever see me like that. My husband doesn&#x27;t ever see me like that&quot;.

On November 11, 2014, it was announced that Martz had stage II pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment in Arizona. She died of the disease on October 30, 2017, in Butte, Montana, at the age of 74.

<text>Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. is an American television and radio broadcasting corporation based in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was founded by Stanley E. Hubbard.

The corporation has broadcast outlets scattered across Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Washington, Florida, and Washington, D.C. KSTP radio, KSTP-FM, KTMY, KSTP-TV, and KSTC-TV, which serve the Twin Cities region of Minnesota and western Wisconsin, are regarded as the company&#x27;s legacy flagship stations.

==History==
KSTP has its origins in the Twin Cities radio station WAMD (&quot;Where All Minneapolis Dances&quot;), which started broadcasting live dance music from a local ballroom on February 13, 1925 with Stanley E. Hubbard as owner and station director. It was the first radio station to be completely supported by income generated by advertisements.

In 1928, WAMD merged with KFOY (Kind Friends of Yours) radio (first broadcast: March 12, 1924) in St. Paul to become KSTP, which was advertised as being operated by the National Battery Broadcasting Co. Hubbard became the merged station&#x27;s general manager, and bought controlling interest in 1941. In 1938 Hubbard bought the first television camera available from RCA. Following the television blackout brought on by World War II, KSTP began television broadcasts in 1948.

KSTP is still Hubbard&#x27;s flagship, although there are now three different stations that carry that name. KSTP (AM) broadcasts a sports radio format, and KSTP-FM broadcasts adult contemporary music; KSTP-TV is affiliated with ABC.

After the Federal Communications Commission relaxed rules about television station ownership, Hubbard bought a second television station in the Twin Cities. Originally affiliated with the Home Shopping Network when it started operations in 1994, KVBM was bought by Hubbard and became general-entertainment independent station KSTC-TV in 2000. It has been used as an alternate outlet for ABC network programming when KSTP-TV is broadcasting coverage of Minnesota Vikings football games or other special shows, including severe-weather coverage.

Aside from terrestrial broadcast stations, other current ventures include the film network ReelzChannel (launched in 2006), the arts network Ovation, and the Hubbard Radio Network, which is used to distribute KSTP&#x27;s local talk shows to subscribing radio stations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The cable channels are run through subsidiary company Hubbard Media Group.

In 1981, Hubbard Broadcasting started U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB), and later was instrumental in the development and launching of the first digital satellite system for television in 1994. The new satellite could deliver 175 channels to a (at the time) tiny, 18 inch dish. USSB&#x27;s development partner, Hughes Electronics (a General Motors subsidiary), launched its own subscription satellite service called DirecTV. The two services did not compete against each other (they carried different channels), and were often marketed together to subscribers by retailers and in advertisements, until DirecTV&#x27;s 1998 acquisition of USSB.

Hubbard was also instrumental in the development of mobile satellite news vehicles. In 1983, Hubbard-owned CONUS Communications and Florida-based subsidiary Hubcom built the first Satellite News Gathering (SNG) mobile vehicle, which allowed for much easier live news coverage for network and local television news operations. This ultimately resulted in CONUS—later a joint-venture with Viacom—becoming a nationwide, satellite-based newsgathering cooperative (with Hubbard charging stations to relay their footage). As an outgrowth of this, Hubbard Broadcasting also operated a 24-hour news station, the All News Channel, which relied on CONUS-sourced news footage and primarily acted as a &quot;sustaining feed&quot; for television stations to fill air time with; ANC was also responsible for producing news programming for third-parties. The news channel lasted from 1989 until it folded in September 2002, which the channels trademark was spun off to became a website which relaunched.

Hubbard Broadcasting also owned the now-closed Bound to be Read bookstores in St. Paul, Albuquerque, and Key Largo.

As of October 2007, it is engaged in a fevered battle with NABET union repping employees of WNYT in Albany, New York.

In June 2009, the &quot;Society of Professional Journalists&quot; honored Hubbard Broadcasting and KSTP-TV with its national Historical Site in Journalism award.

On January 19, 2011, Hubbard announced the purchase of 17 radio stations in Cincinnati, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints subsidiary Bonneville International for $505 million. The sale closed on April 29, 2011.

On February 25, 2013, Hubbard announced that it would purchase MyNetworkTV station WNYA to form a duopoly with WNYT, pending FCC approval. No financial details were announced.

On July 16, 2013, Hubbard announced that it had agreed to purchase 10 stations from Ohio-based Sandusky Radio for $85.5 million.

Hubbard announced on November 13, 2014 that it would purchase the sixteen stations owned by Omni Broadcasting. The Omni stations are all located in central and northern Minnesota.

On September 26, 2018, Hubbard announced that it agreed to purchase six stations owned by Alpha Media in West Palm Beach Florida, for $88 million. The stations include Urban AC 102.3 WMBX, Country 103.1 WIRK, Adult Contemporary 107.9 WEAT, Hot Adult Contemporary 97.9 WRMF, News/Talk 850 WFTL and Sports/Talk 640 WMEN.

Hubbard Broadcasting took over production of &quot;Country Top 40&quot; in January 2020 after the death of the program&#x27;s founder Bob Kingsley. Fitz, a mononymous host with several syndicated country radio programs to his credit, took over as the program&#x27;s host.

<doc id="420801" wikidata="Q7948412" url="?curid=420801" title="WDIO-DT">
<text>WDIO-DT (channel 10) is a television station in Duluth, Minnesota, United States, affiliated with ABC and owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. The station&#x27;s studios and transmitter are located on Observation Road in Duluth.

WIRT-DT (channel 13) in Hibbing, Minnesota, operates as a full-time satellite of WDIO; this station&#x27;s transmitter is located at Maple Hill Park south of Hibbing. WIRT covers areas of Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range (including Grand Rapids, Virginia and Chisholm) that receive a marginal to non-existent over-the-air signal from WDIO, although there is significant overlap between the two stations&#x27; contours otherwise. WIRT is a straight simulcast of WDIO; on-air references to WIRT are limited to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly station identifications during newscasts and other programming. Aside from the transmitter, WIRT does not maintain any physical presence locally in Hibbing.

==History==
WDIO-TV first went on the air on January 24, 1966, and has transmitted from its first day in color. It immediately joined ABC, which had previously been relegated to off-hours clearances on CBS affiliate KDAL-TV (channel 3, now KDLH) and NBC affiliate WDSM-TV (channel 6, now KBJR-TV). It was owned by Frank Befera, a trained engineer who owned a chain of radio stations across northeastern Minnesota. WIRT went on the air on August 31, 1967. Befera sold channels 10 and 13 to publishers Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1977, but remained as president and general manager. HBJ sold the stations to Hubbard Broadcasting in 1986, and Befera retired a year later.

The station utilized a longtime logo from the 1980s until 2019, when it switched to a callsign-only logo. The lettering used in the logo (which blends a number &quot;10&quot; into the &quot;IO&quot; lettering) dates back to as late as the early 1970s. Changes to the 10/13 logo until 2019 merely depended on changes to ABC&#x27;s logo and branding guidelines.

On April 11, 2008, a blizzard swept through the Northland. This resulted in power outages in Duluth, causing WDIO, KDLH and KBJR all to lose their signal at times.

On November 28, 2011, MeTV replaced RTV on 10.2 and 13.2. At the end of September 2017, WDIO/WIRT added Ion Television programming to their third subchannels, and all three signals now run in 720p high definition.

Every New Year&#x27;s Eve, WDIO often cuts in to &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; to broadcast the SMDC New Year&#x27;s Eve Ball, which was a fundraiser for the hospital. In 2008, after 17 years of televising the event, WDIO announced that it would stop its annual broadcast. This decision, along with declining attendance, led to the decision to cancel the event. The Ball itself ran for 23 years and at its peak hosted 4,000 guests.

==News operation==
WDIO/WIRT&#x27;s newscasts were branded throughout the 1970s and 1980s as &quot;Action News&quot;. The station changed its branding to &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; in the early 1990s; it shared this branding with sister station KSTP-TV in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. However, the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding was the station&#x27;s only resemblance to KSTP. WDIO uses its own graphics and music packages.

WDIO and KSTP team up when breaking news happens (example: the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis) or for major election debates.

Longtime WDIO news anchor Dennis Anderson joined the station in 1969, initially as anchor of the nightly news&#x27; &quot;Action Line&quot; segment. He was promoted to chief anchor of the evening newscasts in 1970; he later was the first local TV anchor to announce the sinking of the ore freighter Edmund Fitzgerald which sank in Lake Superior on November 10, 1975. Anderson retired Wednesday, May 25, 2011, after 42 years with the station. Darren Danielson, previously of WDSE, replaced Anderson as anchor the following day, Thursday, May 26.

In October 2009, 20-year veteran Deborah Anderson stepped down from being the lead anchor of the weekend newscasts. The station management filled the vacancy with reporters already employed with the station rather than searching elsewhere for a replacement.

At some point in late 2010 or early 2011, WDIO became the third station in the Duluth area to broadcast its local newscasts in 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen.

The &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding was retired in January 2019 in favor of &quot;WDIO News&quot; along with a new logo and broadcast set.

===Ratings===
Soon after sign-on, WDIO shot to the top of the local news ratings and has remained there more or less ever since. During the 1970s and 1980s, WDIO dominated competitors KDLH and KBJR.

In the May 2007 ratings race, WDIO took first place in all timeslots except at 5 p.m., where they fell to NBC affiliate KBJR. In February 2008, WDIO won with number of viewers in the morning, and at 6 and 10 p.m. KBJR once again came out slightly ahead at 5 p.m. In July 2009, WDIO topped the ratings again. The 10 p.m. newscast had about 7,000 more viewers than second place KBJR. WDIO also won in the weekend ratings.

In November 2009, WDIO doubled the ratings of KBJR at the 10 p.m. newscast with a 12 share compared to KBJR&#x27;s 6 rating and KDLH&#x27;s 3. The station also swept the 5 and 6 p.m. time-slots and with a 14 and an 11 rating respectively. KBJR rated a 10 at the same timeslots according to the Duluth News Tribune. Take note that this ratings period marks one full year anniversary of WDIO&#x27;s market dominance.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
Both stations discontinued regular programming on their analog signals, on February 17, 2009, to conclude the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:
* WDIO discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 10; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 43 to VHF channel 10.
* WIRT discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 13; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 36 to VHF channel 13.

===WIRT-DT translators===
Besides WIRT, WDIO is seen on several outlying digital translators in the Iron Range of northeastern and north-central Minnesota. All of these translators are licensed as repeaters of WIRT; via virtual channel numbering, each translator station remaps to channel 13.

<text>KAAL (channel 6) is a television station licensed to Austin, Minnesota, United States, serving as the ABC affiliate for Southeast Minnesota and Northern Iowa. The station is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting and maintains studios in the TJ Maxx–anchored shopping center on Salem Road in Rochester, Minnesota. Its primary transmitter is located in Grand Meadow Township, with a digital replacement translator in Garner, Iowa, near Mason City.

Channel 6 went on the air as KMMT on August 17, 1953. It was built by a consortium of Austin radio station KAUS and other investors and operated from the same facility as KAUS radio. The station became a sole ABC affiliate the next year, having originally also carried CBS and DuMont programs. From 1958 to 1980, the station was owned by Black Hawk Broadcasting of Waterloo, Iowa; it was renamed KAUS-TV in 1967, and then KAAL in 1974, when Black Hawk sold off the KAUS radio stations.

After a series of other out-of-state owners in the 1980s and 1990s, including the News-Press &amp; Gazette Company, Dix Broadcasting, and Grapevine Communications, KAAL was acquired by Hubbard Broadcasting in 2001. The purchase completed Hubbard&#x27;s ownership of every ABC affiliate in the state of Minnesota. To better compete with market leader KTTC in the growing Rochester area, the station expanded its existing Rochester offices in 2008 and then moved its studios to a new facility there in 2015.

==History==
As the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) neared the end of its multiple-year freeze on TV station awards, Austin radio station KAUS announced in February 1952 that it had filed for a construction permit and acquired an antenna and tower, which were shipped from St. Paul. KAUS&#x27;s application remained pending when the South Central Minnesota Television Company, associated with stations KATE in Albert Lea and KOBK in Owatonna, filed a competing application for channel 6 in January 1953. Facing the prospect of a lengthy comparative hearing to determine who should be allocated the channel, KAUS and the South Central Minnesota Television Company combined their applications in March 1953, joining as the Minnesota-Iowa Television Company and winning the channel 6 permit. The station took the call sign KMMT, the only proposed call sign that was available of a list submitted by the company to the FCC; the KAUS-TV call sign was not available because of the separate ownership.

From studios south of Austin on MN 105, shared with KAUS radio, KMMT signed on the air on August 17, 1953. The station was originally an affiliate of CBS, ABC, and the DuMont Television Network. It also broadcast local news and sports coverage; one early program, &quot;Circle 6 Ranch&quot;, featured country music artist Johnny Western singing songs and presenting films. The CBS and DuMont affiliations in the area moved to KGLO-TV in Mason City, Iowa, when that station began in May 1954. The station also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network, which began in 1956.

Black Hawk Broadcasting of Waterloo, Iowa, assumed management control of KAUS and KMMT on October 1, 1954; the deal included an option to buy the stations, which Black Hawk exercised in 1957. During this time, the station began airing the long-running &quot;Family Hour&quot;, a Christian program hosted by pastor Joe Matt; the 15-minute show remained on the air on channel 6 until 2001, ending its run as the longest-running local TV show in the United States. In 1959, KMMT increased its power to the maximum of 100,000 watts; this expanded the station&#x27;s coverage area as well as that of ABC, which had no nearby affiliates.

Its call letters became KAUS-TV (for Austin) on June 1, 1967, to match its radio sisters; at that time, the station built a new, tower west of Austin for KMMT and to support a new FM station, KAUS-FM 99.9, which launched on May 30, 1968. The old tower was purchased by KTCA-TV and reassembled in the Rushford area for use as part of a translator setup for that station. That same year, KAUS-TV discontinued its translators in La Crosse and Winona after the FCC approved a new La Crosse station, WXOW, which would become an ABC affiliate; KMMT had been transmitting to La Crosse since January 1967. The Winona transmitter was sold to KROC-TV of Rochester, Minnesota, and switched to provide its NBC programming.

Black Hawk Broadcasting sold its Austin radio stations to Withers Broadcasting in 1974. As KAUS-TV and KAUS AM could not share a call sign under separate owners, an exchange was developed. KAUS-TV became KAAL-TV, adopting a call sign which for two years had been used on KAUS-FM. Withers retained the radio studio facility, and KAAL moved the next year to a new site in Austin, a former Volkswagen dealership located on 10th Place NE.

The News-Press &amp; Gazette Company of St. Joseph, Missouri, acquired KAAL for $11.25 million in 1980. The sale was a required divestiture to allow Black Hawk Broadcasting to merge into American Family Corporation; to meet FCC ownership regulations, Black Hawk needed to spin off more than half of the seven broadcast properties it owned. During this time, KAAL originated the telecast of the Miss Minnesota pageant, seen statewide. NPG owned the station for five years, selling for $13.5 million to the Wooster Republican Printing Company of Wooster, Ohio—the Dix family—in 1985. During Dix ownership, KAAL signed a secondary affiliation agreement with Fox. It was also among the first ABC affiliates to agree to carry the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; when football left CBS for Fox in 1994.

Eastern Broadcasting acquired KAAL and KTWO-TV in Casper, Wyoming, from the Dix family in 1995; the owner of Eastern, Roger Neuhoff, came out of retirement to run the two stations. In 1997, Eastern sold its four stations—KAAL, KTWO-TV and repeater KKTU, and KODE-TV in Joplin, Missouri—for $40 million to Atlanta-based Grapevine Communications; two years later, Grapevine acquired GOCOM, though the GOCOM name and corporate offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, were retained.

Hubbard Broadcasting agreed to purchase KAAL from GOCOM in October 2000; it was the last ABC affiliate in Minnesota that Hubbard did not already own. The station began digital broadcasting on February 20, 2002; the analog signal was turned off on June 12, 2009.

Under Hubbard, KAAL has invested resources and shifted the bulk of its operation from Austin to Rochester in an effort to increase news ratings against market-leading KTTC and shed its reputation as a station solely focused on the Austin area. In 2008, the station opened a new Rochester office on Superior Drive NW, which included equipment allowing for a newscast to be presented from both cities. In 2015, it moved to a new and larger southwest Rochester facility, which became the main studio.

<text>Ernest Lee Fletcher (born November 12, 1952) is an American physician and politician who was the 60th governor of Kentucky from 2003 to 2007. He previously served three consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives before resigning after being elected governor. A member of the Republican Party, Fletcher was a family practice physician and a Baptist lay minister and is the second physician to be elected Governor of Kentucky; the first was Luke P. Blackburn in 1879. He was also the first Republican governor of Kentucky since Louie Nunn left office in 1971.

Fletcher graduated from the University of Kentucky and joined the United States Air Force to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut. He left the Air Force after budget cuts reduced his squadron&#x27;s flying time and earned a degree in medicine, hoping to earn a spot as a civilian on a space mission. Deteriorating eyesight eventually ended those hopes, and he entered private practice as a physician and conducted services as a Baptist lay minister. He became active in politics and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1994. Two years later he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to incumbent Scotty Baesler. When Baesler retired to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Fletcher again ran for the congressional seat and defeated Democratic state senator Ernesto Scorsone. He soon became one of the House Republican caucus&#x27;s leaders regarding health care legislation, particularly the Patients&#x27; Bill of Rights.

Fletcher was elected governor in 2003 over state Attorney General Ben Chandler. Early in his term, Fletcher achieved some savings to the state by reorganizing the executive branch. He proposed an overhaul to the state tax code in 2004, but was unable to get it passed through the General Assembly. When Republicans in the state senate insisted on tying the reforms to the state budget, the legislature adjourned without passing either and the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by Fletcher until 2005, when both the budget and the reforms were passed.

Later in 2005, Attorney General Greg Stumbo, the state&#x27;s highest-ranking Democrat, launched an investigation into whether the Fletcher administration&#x27;s hiring practices violated the state&#x27;s merit system. A grand jury returned several indictments against members of Fletcher&#x27;s staff, and eventually against Fletcher himself. Fletcher issued pardons for anyone on his staff implicated in the investigation, but did not pardon himself. Though the investigation was ended by an agreement between Fletcher and Stumbo in late 2006, it continued to overshadow Fletcher&#x27;s re-election bid in 2007. After turning back a challenge in the Republican primary by former Congresswoman Anne Northup, Fletcher lost the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear. After his term as governor, he returned to the medical field as founder and CEO of Alton Healthcare. He is married and has two adult children.

==Early life==
Ernest Lee Fletcher was born in Mount Sterling, Kentucky, on November 12, 1952. He was the third of four children born to Harold Fletcher Sr. and his wife, Marie. The family owned a farm and operated a general store near the community of Means. Harold Fletcher also worked for Columbia Gas. When Ernie was three weeks old, Harold was transferred to Huntington, West Virginia. Two years later, the Fletchers returned to Robertson County, Kentucky, where they lived until Ernie Fletcher began the first grade. The family moved once more and finally settled in Lexington.

Fletcher attended Lafayette High School in Lexington, where he was a member of the National Beta Club. During his senior year, he was an all-state saxophone player and was elected prom king. After graduating in 1970, he enrolled at the University of Kentucky. He pledged and became a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After his freshman year, he married his high school sweetheart, Glenna Foster. The couple had two children, Rachel and Ben, and four grandchildren.

Fletcher aspired to become an astronaut, and joined the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. In 1974, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering, graduating with top honors. After graduation, he joined the U.S. Air Force. After flight training in Oklahoma, he was stationed in Alaska where he served as a F-4E Aircraft commander and NORAD Alert Force commander. During the Cold War, his duties included commanding squadrons to intercept Soviet military aircraft. In 1980, as budget cutbacks were reducing his squadron&#x27;s flying time, Fletcher turned down a regular commission in the Air Force. He left the Air Force with the rank of captain, having received the Air Force Commendation Medal and the Outstanding Unit Award.

Fletcher enrolled in the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, hoping that a medical degree, along with a military background, would earn him a civilian spot on a space mission. In 1984, he graduated medical school with a Doctor of Medicine degree, but his deteriorating eyesight forced him to abandon his dreams of becoming an astronaut.

In 1983, the Lexington Primitive Baptist church that Fletcher attended ordained him as a lay minister. In 1984, he opened a family medical practice in Lexington. Along with former classmate Dr. James D. B. George, he co-founded the South Lexington Family Physicians in 1987. For two years, he concurrently held the title of chief executive officer of the Saint Joseph Medical Foundation, an organization that solicits private gifts to Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center in Lexington. In 1989, Fletcher&#x27;s church called him to become its unpaid pastor, but over the years, he grew to question some of the church&#x27;s doctrines, desiring it to become more evangelistic. Consequently, he left the Primitive Baptist denomination in 1994 and joined the Porter Memorial Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist congregation.

==Legislative career==
Through his church ministry, Fletcher became acquainted with a group of social conservatives that gained control of the Fayette County Republican Party in 1990. (Fayette County and the city of Lexington operate under the merged Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government). Fletcher accepted an invitation to become a member of the county Republican committee. In 1994, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, defeating incumbent Democrat Leslie Trapp. He represented Kentucky&#x27;s 78th District and served on the Kentucky Commission on Poverty and the Task Force on Higher Education. He was also chosen by Governor Paul E. Patton to assist with reforming the state&#x27;s health-care system.
As a result of legislative redistricting in 1996, Fletcher&#x27;s district was consolidated with the one represented by fellow Republican Stan Cave. Rather than challenge a member of his own party, Fletcher decided to run for a seat representing Kentucky&#x27;s 6th District in the U.S. House of Representatives later that year. After winning a three-way Republican primary by 4 votes over his closest opponent, he was defeated by incumbent Democrat Scotty Baesler by just over 25,000 votes. In 1998, Baesler resigned his seat to run for the U.S. Senate seat vacated due to the retirement of Senator Wendell H. Ford. Fletcher won the Republican primary for Baesler&#x27;s seat by a wide margin. In the general election, Fletcher faced Democrat Ernesto Scorsone. The &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; billed the race as &quot;a classic joust between the left and the right&quot;. Fletcher was strongly opposed to abortion, advocated a &quot;flatter, fairer, simpler&quot; tax system, and called for returning most federal education funding to local communities. Scorsone supported abortion rights, called a flat tax &quot;too regressive&quot;, and favored national educational testing and standards. Fletcher defeated Scorsone by a vote of 104,046 to 90,033, with third-party candidate W. S. Krogdahl garnering 1,839 votes.

Within months of arriving in Washington, D.C., Fletcher was selected as the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee&#x27;s employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee&#x27;s purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher&#x27;s experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served as a member of the House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students&#x27; moral character; the amendment passed 422–1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.

During the debate over the proposed Patients&#x27; Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient&#x27;s ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party&#x27;s bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher&#x27;s position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler&#x27;s bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher&#x27;s 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.

After the 2000 election, Fletcher crafted a compromise bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped pain and suffering awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher&#x27;s bill by President George W. Bush, the House refused to pass it, favoring an alternative proposal by Georgia&#x27;s Charlie Norwood that was less restrictive on patient lawsuits.

Fletcher faced no major-party opposition in his re-election bid in 2002 after the only Democrat in the race, 24-year-old Roy Miller Cornett Jr., withdrew his candidacy. Independent Gatewood Galbraith again made the race; Libertarian Mark Gailey also mounted a challenge. In the final vote tally, Fletcher received 115,522 votes to Galbraith&#x27;s 41,853 and Gailey&#x27;s 3,313.

==2003 gubernatorial election==
In 2002, Fletcher was encouraged by Senator Mitch McConnell, the leader of Kentucky&#x27;s Republican Party, to run for governor and formed an exploratory committee the same year. On December 2, 2002, he announced that he would run on a ticket with McConnell aide Hunter Bates. Early in 2003, a Republican college student named Curtis Shain challenged Bates&#x27; candidacy on grounds that he did not meet the residency requirements set forth for the lieutenant governor in the state constitution. Under the constitution, candidates for both governor and lieutenant governor must be citizens of the state for at least six years prior to the election. From August 1995 to February 2002, Bates and his wife rented an apartment in Alexandria, Virginia while Bates was working for a law firm in Washington, D.C., and later, as McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff. Bob Heleringer, a former state representative from suburban Louisville and the running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Nunn, joined the suit as a plaintiff. In March 2003, an Oldham County judge ruled that Bates had not established residency in Kentucky. He cited the fact that from 1995 to 2002, Bates held a Virginia driver&#x27;s license, paid Virginia income taxes, and &quot;regularly&quot; slept in his apartment in Virginia. Bates did not appeal the ruling because by allowing the judge to declare a vacancy on the ballot, Fletcher was able to name a replacement running mate, an option that would not have been afforded him had Bates withdrawn.

Fletcher chose Steve Pence, United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, as his new running mate. Heleringer continued his legal challenge, first claiming that Bates&#x27; ineligibility should have invalidated the entire Fletcher/Bates ticket and then that Fletcher should not have been allowed to name a replacement for an unqualified candidate. The Kentucky Supreme Court rejected that argument on May 7, 2003, though the justices&#x27; reasons for doing so varied and the final opinion conceded that &quot;[t]his is a close case on the law, and Heleringer has presented legal issues worthy of this court&#x27;s time and attention&quot;. The state Board of Elections instructed all county clerks to count absentee ballots cast for Fletcher and Bates as votes for Fletcher and Pence.

In the Republican primary, Fletcher received 53 percent of the vote, besting Nunn, Jefferson County judge/executive Rebecca Jackson, and state senator Virgil Moore. In the Democratic primary, Attorney General Ben Chandler defeated Speaker of the House Jody Richards. Chandler, the grandson of former governor A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, was hurt in the closing days of the campaign when a third challenger, businessman Bruce Lunsford dropped out of the race and endorsed Richards. Chandler won the Democratic primary by just 3.7 percentage points and was forced to reorganize his campaign. Consequently, Fletcher entered the general election as the favorite.

Due to the funding from the Republican Governors Association, Fletcher held a two-to-one fundraising advantage over Chandler. A sex-for-favors scandal that ensnared sitting Democratic governor Paul Patton, as well as a predicted $710 million shortfall in the upcoming budget, damaged the entire Democratic slate of candidates&#x27; chances for election. Fletcher capitalized on these issues, promising to &quot;clean up the mess&quot; in Frankfort, and won the election by a vote of 596,284 (55%) to 487,159 (45%). In all, Republicans captured four of the seven statewide constitutional offices in 2003; Trey Grayson was elected Secretary of State and Richie Farmer was elected Commissioner of Agriculture. Fletcher resigned his seat in the House on December 8, 2003, and assumed the governorship the following day. Fletcher&#x27;s victory made him the first Republican elected governor of Kentucky since 1971, and his margin of victory was the largest ever for a Republican in a Kentucky gubernatorial election.

==Governor of Kentucky==
Fletcher made economic development a priority, and Kentucky ranked fourth among all U.S. states in number of jobs created during his administration. One of his first actions as governor was to reorganize the executive branch, condensing the number of cabinet positions from fourteen to nine. He dissolved the former Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and instead created the Kentucky Horse Racing Authority to promote and regulate the state&#x27;s horse racing industry. To improve the state&#x27;s management of Medicaid, he rolled back some of the program&#x27;s requirements and unveiled a plan to focus on improvements in care, benefit management, and technology. Fletcher also launched &quot;Get Healthy Kentucky!,&quot; an initiative to promote healthier lifestyles for Kentuckians.

===2004 state budget dispute===
Throughout Fletcher&#x27;s term, the Kentucky Senate was controlled by Republicans, while Democrats held a majority in the state House of Representatives. Consequently, Fletcher had difficulty getting legislation enacted in the General Assembly. Early in the 2004 legislative session, he presented a plan for tax reform that he claimed was &quot;revenue neutral&quot; and would &quot;modernize&quot; the state tax code. The plan was drafted with input from seven Democratic legislators in the House, none of them in leadership roles, leading to claims that Fletcher was trying to circumvent House leadership. As the session wore on, Republicans insisted on tying the tax reform package to the proposed state budget, while Democrats wanted to vote on the measures separately. Despite last minute attempts at a compromise as the session drew to a close, the Assembly passed neither the tax reform package nor a state budget. The contentious session ended with only a few accomplishments, including passage of a fetal homicide law, an anti-price gouging measure, and a law barring the state public service commission from regulating broadband Internet providers beyond what restrictions were put in place by the Federal Communications Commission.

The 2004 session marked the second consecutive session in which the General Assembly had failed to pass a biennial budget; the first occurred in 2002 under Governor Patton. When the fiscal year ended without a budget in place, responsibility for state expenditures fell to Fletcher. As it had been in 2002, spending was governed by an executive spending plan created by the governor. Democratic Attorney General Greg Stumbo filed suit asking for a determination on the extent of Fletcher&#x27;s ability to spend without legislative approval. A similar suit, filed after the 2002 session ended in deadlock, was rendered moot when the legislature passed a budget in a special session prior to the conclusion of the lawsuit. A judicial review by a Franklin County circuit court judge approved Fletcher&#x27;s spending plan but forbade spending on new capital projects and programs. In late December 2004, a judge ruled that Fletcher&#x27;s plan could continue to govern spending until the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2005, but &quot;thereafter&quot; executive spending was to be limited to &quot;funds demonstrated to be for limited and specific essential services.&quot;

On May 19, 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court issued a 4–3 decision stating that the General Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by not passing a budget and that Fletcher had acted outside his constitutional authority by spending money not specifically appropriated by the legislature. The majority opinion rejected the lower court&#x27;s exception for &quot;specific essential services&quot;, saying &quot;If the legislative department fails to appropriate funds deemed sufficient to operate the executive department at a desired level of services, the executive department must serve the citizenry as best it can with what it is given. If the citizenry deems those services insufficient, it will exercise its own constitutional power – the ballot.&quot; Chief Justice Joseph Lambert dissented, claiming the executive spending plan was necessary. Two other justices, in a separate opinion, disagreed with the majority that federal and state constitutional mandates should still be funded in the absence of a budget. In their dissent, they argued that the threat of a government shutdown would act as an impetus for the General Assembly to engage in timely budget-making. The decision took no retroactive steps to change the actions it ruled unconstitutional, but it served as a precedent for any future cases of budgetary gridlock.

===Legislative interim and 2005 legislative session===
In June 2004, Fletcher&#x27;s aircraft caused a security scare that triggered a brief evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court building. Shortly after takeoff en route to memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan, the transponder on Fletcher&#x27;s plane malfunctioned, leading officials at Reagan National Airport to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace. Two F-15 fighters were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher&#x27;s plane was escorted to its destination by two Blackhawk helicopters. The plane, a 33-year-old Beechcraft King Air, was the oldest of its model still in operation. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher&#x27;s plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted air space. The investigation determined that miscommunication by air traffic controllers sparked the panic, and in the aftermath of the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.
In July 2004, Fletcher announced a plan to unify the state&#x27;s branding to improve its public perception. Shortly after the announcement, late-night comedians Craig Kilborn and Jay Leno made some tongue-in-cheek suggestions for the new slogan on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, respectively. In response, Fletcher wrote a letter to both comedians taking exception to the jokes and was invited to appear on both programs. Citing Leno&#x27;s larger audience and earlier time slot, Fletcher agreed to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, where he presented Leno with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat and traded jocular barbs about the relative advantages of Kentucky and Los Angeles where &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; is taped. Eventually, four slogans were chosen to be voted on online as well as at interstate travel centers. In December 2004, &quot;Kentucky: Unbridled Spirit&quot; was chosen as the winning slogan and was printed on road signs, state documents, and souvenirs. A 2007 study determined that 88.9% of Kentuckians could correctly identify the slogan and its logo. Further, 64% of those surveyed across a ten-state region recognized the slogan and logo, higher than any other brand tested in the study.

In the second half of 2004, Fletcher proposed changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher&#x27;s plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher&#x27;s plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session&#x27;s agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.

On November 8, 2004, Fletcher signed a death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, who was convicted of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by lethal injection. A group of doctors requested an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher&#x27;s medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.

During the General Assembly&#x27;s 2005 session, Fletcher again proposed his tax reform plan, and late in the session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget for the remainder of the biennium, abolished the state&#x27;s public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.

===Merit system investigation===

In May 2005, Attorney General Stumbo began an investigation of allegations that the Fletcher administration circumvented the state merit system for hiring, promoting, demoting and firing state employees by basing decisions on employees&#x27; political loyalties. The investigation was prompted by a 276-page complaint filed by Douglas W. Doerting, the assistant personnel director for the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Fletcher, who was on a trade mission in Japan when news of the investigation broke, conceded via telephone news conference that his office may have made &quot;mistakes&quot; with regard to hiring that stemmed from not having a formal process for handling employment recommendations. Upon his return from Japan, Fletcher denied that the &quot;mistakes&quot; by his administration were illegal and called the investigation by Stumbo &quot;the beginning of the 2007 governor&#x27;s race&quot;, an allusion to Stumbo&#x27;s potential candidacy in 2007. Stumbo denied any plans to run for governor in 2007, although he eventually became gubernatorial candidate Bruce Lunsford&#x27;s running mate in the election, losing in the Democratic primary.

A grand jury was empaneled in June 2005 to investigate the charges against Fletcher&#x27;s administration. By August, the jury had returned indictments against nine administration officials, including state Republican Party chairman Darrell Brock Jr. and acting Transportation Secretary Bill Nighbert. All of the indictments were for misdemeanors such as conspiracy except those against Administrative Services Commissioner Dan Druen, who was charged with 22 felonies (20 counts of physical evidence tampering and 2 counts of witness tampering) in addition to 13 misdemeanors. On August 29, Fletcher granted pardons to the nine indicted administration officials and issued a blanket pardon for &quot;any and all persons who have committed, or may be accused of committing, any offense&quot; with regard to the investigation. Fletcher exempted himself from the blanket pardon. The next day, Fletcher was called to testify before the grand jury, but refused to answer any questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

In mid-September, after Fletcher issued the pardons, a &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; poll found Fletcher&#x27;s approval rating at 38 percent, tying the lowest rating reached by his predecessor, Paul E. Patton, during the sex scandal that tarnished his administration. On September 14, 2005, Fletcher fired nine employees, including four of the nine he pardoned two weeks earlier. The firings were praised by Fletcher critic Charles Wells of the Kentucky Association of State Employees, who said: &quot;When all else fails, the governor did the right thing.&quot; However, Democratic state senator and former governor Julian Carroll criticized Fletcher for not firing the indicted officials when he issued the pardons. Fletcher also called for the firing of state Republican Party chair Darrell Brock Jr. due to Brock&#x27;s role in the merit scandal. The state Republican executive committee met on September 17, but did not act on Fletcher&#x27;s call to fire Brock.

The grand jury continued its investigation, issuing five more indictments after Fletcher issued his blanket pardon. Two were returned against members of Fletcher&#x27;s staff, and two were against unpaid advisors to Fletcher. The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a whistleblower. Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the pardon. On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order the grand jury to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted officials could be included in the jury&#x27;s final report. On November 16, Graham ruled that the grand jury could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed the indictments against Fletcher&#x27;s staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the pardon. Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed Graham&#x27;s ruling on December 16. Immediately after the Court of Appeals&#x27; ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court.

===2006 legislative session===
On February 12, 2006, shortly after the beginning of the General Assembly&#x27;s legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a gallstone in his common bile duct and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and gallbladder disease. After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph&#x27;s with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital. Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not have a negative impact on his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state&#x27;s prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an all-terrain vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.

The Assembly passed a biennial budget, but did not allow enough time in the session to reconvene and potentially override any of Fletcher&#x27;s vetoes. In an attempt to avoid &quot;excessive debt&quot;, Fletcher used his line-item veto to trim $370 million in projects from the budget passed by the Assembly. Although falling far short of his initial prediction of vetoing $938 million, Fletcher used the line-item veto more than any other governor in state history. One project not vetoed by Fletcher was $11 million for the University of the Cumberlands to build a pharmacy school. LGBT rights groups had asked Fletcher to veto the funds because the university, a private Baptist school, had expelled a student for being openly gay.

One of Fletcher&#x27;s priorities that was not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature&#x27;s efficiency.

===Investigation concludes===
As the Kentucky Supreme Court prepared to hear Fletcher&#x27;s appeal on whether the grand jury could continue to indict people covered by his blanket pardon, two of the court&#x27;s seven justices recused themselves from the case, citing conflicts of interest. Kentucky&#x27;s constitution provides that, in the case of more than one recusal on the court, the governor is to appoint special justices to replace them. Accordingly, Fletcher named two replacements, but one of those – Circuit Judge Jeffrey Burdette – declined to serve on grounds that he had contributed to Fletcher&#x27;s 2003 gubernatorial campaign. Fletcher then named another special justice to replace Burdette, consistent with a precedent set by former Democratic Governor Brereton Jones. Stumbo challenged this third appointment, claiming that Burdette&#x27;s refusal to serve created only one vacancy on the court, and that the case could be tried with six justices. The Kentucky Supreme Court sustained Stumbo&#x27;s complaint. In a 4–2 ruling issued May 18, 2006, the Kentucky Supreme Court barred the grand jury from issuing further indictments against individuals covered by Fletcher&#x27;s blanket pardon, reversing the Court of Appeals. The ruling did not affect indictments for crimes allegedly committed after the pardon was issued. The Supreme Court also held that the grand jury could issue a general report of its findings at the conclusion of its investigation, but left open the question of whether the names of unindicted individuals could appear in the report. A later decision by the Court of Appeals found that unindicted individuals could not be named in the report.

Just prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, the grand jury handed down indictments against Fletcher for three misdemeanors – conspiracy, official misconduct, and political discrimination. Fletcher did not appear at his arraignment on June 9 because he was on vacation in Florida; his attorney entered &quot;not guilty&quot; pleas to all three charges on his behalf. On August 11, 2006, Special Judge David E. Melcher ruled that because the personnel violations were allegedly committed while Fletcher was acting in his official capacity as governor, he was protected by executive immunity and could not be prosecuted until he left office. Melcher asked that the two sides work together to reach a settlement in the case. On August 24, Fletcher and Stumbo announced such an agreement. Under the settlement, Fletcher acknowledged that evidence &quot;strongly indicate[d] wrongdoing by his administration&quot; but did not admit any wrongdoing personally. Fletcher also acknowledged that Stumbo&#x27;s prosecution of the case &quot;[was a] necessary and proper [exercise] of his constitutional duty&quot; and ensured that abuses of the merit system would be ended. In addition to dropping the charges against Fletcher, Stumbo conceded that any violations by Fletcher&#x27;s administration were &quot;without malice&quot;. Four members of the state Personnel Board who were appointed by Fletcher were required to step down. Their replacements would be chosen by Fletcher from a list provided by Stumbo.

The grand jury issued its report on the investigation in October 2006, and a judge ordered it released to the public on November 16. The report categorized the Fletcher administration&#x27;s actions as &quot;a widespread and coordinated plan to violate merit hiring laws.&quot; It charged that &quot;This investigation was not about a few people here and there who made some mistakes as Governor Ernie Fletcher had claimed,&quot; and lamented that the blanket pardon issued by Fletcher, coupled with Fletcher taking the Fifth, made it &quot;difficult to get to the bottom of the facts of this case...As a result, [the grand jury was] in part forced to rely on documentary evidence to piece together the facts of the case.&quot; Fletcher opined that the allegations in the report were inconsistent with his settlement with Stumbo, which acknowledged that Fletcher&#x27;s administration acted &quot;without malice.&quot;

==2007 gubernatorial election==

In early 2005, Fletcher announced his intent to run for re-election. Shortly after Fletcher was indicted by the grand jury in 2006, Lieutenant Governor Pence announced that he would not be Fletcher&#x27;s running mate during his re-election bid. Fletcher asked for Pence&#x27;s immediate resignation as lieutenant governor. Pence declined, but did tender his resignation as head of the Justice Cabinet. Fletcher named his executive secretary, Robbie Rudolph, as his new running mate.

Although Fletcher&#x27;s agreement with Stumbo to end the investigation was announced in late 2006, the scandal continued to plague his re-election bid, and he drew two challengers in the Republican primary – former Third District Congresswoman Anne Northup and multi-millionaire Paducah businessman Billy Harper. Senator Mitch McConnell, the consensus leader of the Kentucky Republican Party, declined to make an endorsement in the primary, but conceded that Northup was &quot;a formidable opponent&quot;. Northup campaigned on the idea that Fletcher&#x27;s involvement in the hiring scandal had made him &quot;unelectable&quot;. Northup secured the endorsements of Jim Bunning, Kentucky&#x27;s other Republican senator, and Lieutenant Governor Pence. In the primary, Fletcher garnered over 50% of the vote and secured the party&#x27;s nomination. His rival Northup struggled with name recognition and found few areas of support outside the Louisville district she represented in Congress. She garnered 36.5% of the vote, with the remaining 13.4% going to Billy Harper. Democrats nominated former Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear to challenge Fletcher.

In the midst of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state&#x27;s minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, increasing the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state&#x27;s retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher&#x27;s agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.

In the general election campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding a referendum on a constitutional amendment to allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 (59%) to 435,895 (41%).

After the election, Fletcher founded Alton Healthcare, a consulting firm that helps healthcare providers make efficient use of technology in their practice. He has served as CEO of the company, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, since 2008.

<text>Seaforth (2021 population: 2,673) is a Southern Ontario community in the municipality of Huron East, in Huron County, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
Originally known as &quot;Four Corners&quot; and &quot;Steene&#x27;s Corners&quot; after an early settler, much of the area of what is now Seaforth was acquired by brothers Christopher and George Sparling in anticipation of the construction of the Buffalo, Brantford and Goderich Railway. Developer James Patton of Barrie purchased the land and laid out a townsite in 1855. The name &#x27;Seaforth&#x27; may be derived from the Scottish Seaforth Highlanders regiment or Loch Seaforth in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

A post office was established in Seaforth in 1859. Incorporation as a Village followed in 1868 and as a Town in 1874. In 2001, Seaforth was amalgamated with Brussels, Grey Township, McKillop Township and Tuckersmith Township to form the Municipality of Huron East.

In September 1876, at two o&#x27;clock in the morning, a fire broke out in Mrs. Griffith&#x27;s Candy and Grocery Store, raging through Main Street and destroying of the business section. The town rebounded and Main Street was rebuilt with the brick and block structures which stand today.

Seaforth&#x27;s Main Street was designated in 1984 as a Heritage Conservation District because of its distinguished late 19th-century architecture. This architectural composition of two-storey brick buildings is unique in its uniformity of scale and character. Through grants and local support, property owners have been encouraged to restore and preserve the architectural characteristics of their buildings.

===The Van Egmond Reserve===
Built by the eldest son of Colonel Anthony Van Egmond in 1846, it represents an example of Georgian architecture and Classical Revival styles. The house was restored with assistance from the Ontario Heritage Trust. The bricks were handmade on the property. Their variance in colour in the exterior walls is an indication that the home was built over an extended period of time, their difference in colour being a result of the varying conditions under which successive loads of bricks were fired during the course of construction.
The house and grounds were saved in the early 1970s from demolition and a housing development by a group of community volunteers. Funds were raised to purchase the property and restore it to how it might have been prior to 1867. It was recognized as an Ontario Heritage property and signs indicative of that direct travelers to the Reserve. The Province of Ontario supported the restoration of the property and will become its owners should the local Van Egmond Foundation discontinue its work to ensure the property is safe and open to the public, in the summer and for special events. The Foundation continues to raise funds and to ensure the property is recognized as a local resource attempting to preserve the history of the early settlement and development of the region.

<text>Beneficial insects (sometimes called beneficial bugs) are any of a number of species of insects that perform valued services like pollination and pest control. The concept of &quot;beneficial&quot; is subjective and only arises in light of desired outcomes from a human perspective. In agriculture, where the goal is to raise selected crops, insects that hinder the production process are classified as pests, while insects that assist production are considered beneficial. In horticulture and gardening, beneficial insects are often considered those that contribute to pest control and native habitat integration.

Encouraging beneficial insects, by providing suitable living conditions, is a pest control strategy, often used in organic farming, organic gardening or integrated pest management. Companies specializing in biological pest control sell many types of beneficial insects, particularly for use in enclosed areas, like greenhouses.

==Types==


Some species of bee are beneficial as pollinators, although generally only efficient at pollinating plants from the same area of origin, facilitating propagation and fruit production for many plants. This group includes not only honeybees, but also many other kinds of bees that are more efficient at pollinating plants native to their region. Bees can be attracted by many companion plants, especially bee balm and pineapple sage for honeybees. 
Wasps, especially fig wasps are also beneficial as pollinators.

Ladybugs are generally thought of as beneficial because they eat large quantities of aphids, mites and other arthropods that feed on various plants. 

Other insects commonly identified as beneficial include:
* Aphid midges
* Assassin bugs
* Damsel bugs
* Earwigs
* Green lacewings
* Ichneumon wasps
* Minute pirate bugs
* Fireflies
* Praying Mantis
* Soldier beetles
* Syrphid flies
* Tachinid flies
* Trichogramma wasps

==Attractive plants==

Plants in the families Apiaceae and Asteraceae are generally valuable companions. Here are other plants that attract beneficial insects:

*Alfalfa
*Alyssum
*Borage
*Calendula
*Cilantro
*Cosmos
*Dandelion
*Dill
*Echinacea
*Fennel
*Hyssop
*Lupin
*Marigold
*Milkweed
*Nasturtium
*Parsley
*Phacelia
*Queen Anne&#x27;s lace
*Rose
*Rudbeckia
*Sunflower
*Wildflowers
*Yarrow
*Zinnia

<doc id="420811" wikidata="Q429348" url="?curid=420811" title="Jimmie Davis">
<text>James Houston Davis (September 11, 1899 – November 5, 2000) was an American singer, songwriter, and Democratic Party politician. After achieving fame for releasing both sacred and popular songs, Davis served as governor of Louisiana from 1944 to 1948 and again from 1960 to 1964. As Governor, he was an opponent of efforts to desegregate Louisiana.

Davis was a nationally popular country music and gospel singer from the 1930s into the 1960s, occasionally recording and performing as late as the early 1990s. He appeared as himself in a number of Hollywood movies. He was inducted into six halls of fame, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. At the time of his death in 2000, he was the oldest living former governor as well as the last living governor to have been born in the 19th century.

==Early life and career==

=== Childhood and birth date confusion ===
Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had the slightest idea when it really was.&quot; The birth date listed on his Country Music Hall of Fame plaque is September 11, 1904.

=== Education ===
Davis graduated from Beech Springs High School and from Soule Business College, in New Orleans. His 1927 master&#x27;s thesis, which examines the intelligence levels of different races, is titled &quot;Comparative Intelligence of Whites, Blacks and Mulattoes.&quot;

=== Career beginnings ===
During the late 1920s, Davis taught history (and, unofficially, yodeling) for a year at the former Dodd College for Girls in Shreveport. The college president, Monroe E. Dodd, who was also the pastor of First Baptist Church of Shreveport and a radio preacher, invited Davis to serve on the faculty.

==Musical career==
Davis became a commercially successful singer of rural music before he entered politics. His early work was in the style of country music singer Jimmie Rodgers. Davis was also known for recording energetic and raunchy blues tunes, such as &quot;Red Nightgown Blues&quot; and &quot;Tom Cat and Pussy Blues&quot;. Some of these records included slide guitar accompaniment by black bluesman Oscar &quot;Buddy&quot; Woods. During his first run for governor, opponents reprinted the lyrics of some of these songs in order to undermine Davis&#x27;s campaign. In one case, anti-Davis forces played some records over an outdoor sound system, only to give up after the crowds started dancing, ignoring the double-entendre lyrics. Until the end of his life, Davis never denied or repudiated those records.

In 1999, &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; was ranked in 2003 as No. 73 on &quot;CMT&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music&quot;. Virginia Shehee, a Shreveport businesswoman, philanthropist, and state senator, introduced legislation to designate &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; as the official state song. The song was reportedly written for Elizabeth Selby, a resident of Urbana, Illinois and housemother of Wescoga (&quot;Wesley Co-Op for Gals&quot;) at the time the song was written.

Davis often performed during his campaign stops when running for governor of Louisiana. After being elected in 1944, he became known as the &quot;singing governor.&quot; While governor, he had a No. 1 hit single in 1945 with &quot;There&#x27;s a New Moon Over My Shoulder&quot;. Davis recorded for the Victor Talking Machine Company, and Decca Records for decades and released more than 40 albums.

A long-time Southern Baptist, Davis recorded a number of Southern gospel albums. In 1967 he served as president of the Gospel Music Association. He was a close friend of the North Dakota-born band leader Lawrence Welk, who frequently reminded viewers of his television program of his association with Davis.

A number of his songs were used as part of motion picture soundtracks. Davis appeared in half a dozen films, including one starring Ozzie and Harriet, who had a TV series under their names. Members of Davis&#x27;s last band included Allen &quot;Puddler&quot; Harris of Lake Charles. He had served as pianist for singer Ricky Nelson early in his career.

Davis was also a close acquaintance of the country singer-songwriter Hank Williams, with whom he co-wrote the top-10 hit &quot;(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle&quot; in 1951, supposedly on a fishing day they spent together.

==Political career==
Davis was elected in 1938 as Shreveport&#x27;s public safety commissioner. At the time, Shreveport had the city commission form of government. After four years in Shreveport City Hall, Davis was elected in 1942 to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The rate-making body meets in the capital, Baton Rouge. He was elected during his term as governor and left after two years.

===First term as governor (1944–1948)===

Davis was elected governor as a Democrat in 1944. Among those eliminated in the primary were State Senator Ernest S. Clements of Oberlin in Allen Parish, freshman U.S. Representative James H. Morrison of Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish, and Sam Caldwell, the mayor of Shreveport. Davis and Caldwell had served together earlier in Shreveport municipal government.

In the runoff, Davis defeated Lewis L. Morgan, an elderly attorney and former U.S. representative from Covington, the seat of St. Tammany Parish, who had been backed by former Governor Earl Kemp Long and New Orleans Mayor Robert Maestri. In the runoff, Davis received 251,228 (53.6 percent) to Morgan&#x27;s 217,915 (46.4 percent).

Davis pleased white liberals with his appointments to high positions of two of the leaders of the impeachment effort against Huey Long. He named Cecil Morgan of Shreveport to the Louisiana Civil Service Commission. Morgan was succeeded in the Louisiana House by Rupert Peyton of Shreveport, who also served as an aide to Davis. In addition, Davis retained the anti-Long Ralph Norman Bauer of St. Mary Parish as House speaker, a selection made originally in 1940 by Sam Jones.

Earl Long was seeking the lieutenant governorship on the Lewis Morgan &quot;ticket&quot; and led in the first primary in 1944, but he lost the runoff to J. Emile Verret of New Iberia, then the president of the Iberia Parish School Board.

Davis kept his hand in show business, and set a record for absenteeism during his first term. He made numerous trips to Hollywood to make Western &quot;horse operas.&quot;

Under the term limit provision of the state constitution then in effect, Davis was limited to a single non-consecutive term in office.

===The election of 1959–1960===

When he became a candidate for a second term in 1959–60, Davis had been out of office for nearly a dozen years. In a later study of this election, three Louisiana State University political scientists described him by the following:

Davis has all the external attributes of a &quot;man of the people&quot;, but his serious political connections seem to be with the [parish-seat] elite and its allies, particularly the major industrial combinations of the state. He is in many respects a toned-down version of the old-style southern politician who could spellbound the mass of voters into supporting him regardless of the effects of his programs on their welfare. ... Davis creates the perfect image of a man to be trusted and one whose intense calm is calculated to bring rational balance into the political life of the state.

Davis was running at a time when African Americans in the civil rights movement were seeking social justice and restoration of their constitutional rights. In 1954 the US Supreme Court had ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional and urged states to integrate their facilities. With a pledge to fight for continued segregation in public education, Davis won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination over a crowded field.

Davis ran second in the primary to &quot;Chep&quot; Morrison, considered an anti-Long liberal by Louisiana standards. He defeated Morrison in the party runoff held on January 9, 1960. As African Americans (who had supported the Republican Party after the Civil War) were still largely disenfranchised in Louisiana, the Democratic primary was the only competitive race for office in the one-party state.

It has been reported that had General Curtis LeMay turned down George C. Wallace&#x27;s offer to be his candidate for vice president in 1968 on the American Independent Party ticket, that Wallace was ready to announce Davis as his selection for vice president. Other sources say Wallace&#x27;s second choice was the former governor of Arkansas Orval Faubus.

===Second term (1960–1964)===
As part of his support of segregation, Davis initiated passage of state legislation to create the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission, which operated from 1960 to 1967. It &quot;espoused states rights, anti-communist and segregationist ideas, with a particular focus on maintaining the status quo in race relations. It was closely allied with the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities.&quot; It was modeled after Mississippi&#x27;s commission, established in 1956 to resist integration. Davis tapped Frank Voelker Jr., City Attorney of Lake Providence, to chair the newly established Commission. It was given unusual powers to investigate state citizens, and used its authority to exert economic pressure to suppress civil rights activists. Voelker left the commission in 1963 to run for governor but placed poorly in the primary; he withdrew and supported other candidates.

===Political legacy===
Davis established a State Retirement System and funding of more than $100 million in public improvements, while leaving the state with a $38 million surplus after his first term.

Earl Long once remarked that Davis was so relaxed and low-key that one could not &quot;wake up Jimmie Davis with an earthquake&quot;.

Public relations specialist Gus Weill, who worked in the Davis campaign in 1959, wrote a biography of the former governor in 1977, entitled &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; based on Davis&#x27; best-known song.

==Personal life==
Davis&#x27;s first wife, the former Alvern Adams, the daughter of a physician in Shreveport, was the first lady while he was governor during both terms. A little over a year after Alvern&#x27;s death in 1967, Davis married the widowed Anna Gordon (February 15, 1917 – March 5, 2004) in a small ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia on December 4, 1968 (The Tennessean). Anna was born Effie Juanita Carter and had been a founding member of the gospel quartet The Chuck Wagon Gang along with her father, a sister and a brother. She had been given the stage name &quot;Anna&quot; during the mid-1930s. Davis was a longtime fan of the group, who were gospel music pioneers with more than 36 million records sold in forty years of affiliation with Columbia Records.

Davis died on November 5, 2000. He had suffered a fall in his home some ten months earlier and may have had a stroke in his last days. He is interred alongside his first wife at the Jimmie Davis Tabernacle Cemetery in his native Beech Springs community near Quitman. His adopted son, Jim Davis, passed away in 2012 and was cremated.

Davis was aged 101 years and 55 days, which made him the longest-lived of all U.S. state governors at the time of his death. Davis held this record until March 18, 2011, when Albert Rosellini of Washington achieved a greater lifespan of 101 years, 56 days, dying 206 days later.

==Honors==

The Jimmie Davis Tabernacle is located near Weston in Jackson Parish. The tabernacle hosts occasional gospel singing. At the site is a replica of the Davis homestead (c. 1900) and of the Peckerwood Hill Store, an old general store that served the community.

Davis was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971, the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1972, the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 1997 and The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2008. In 1993, Davis was among the first thirteen inductees of the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.
The Davis archives of papers and photographs is housed in the &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; Collection of the Linus A. Sims Memorial Library at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond.

==Filmography==
Davis had several appearances in movies (usually or always as himself), including:
*1942: &quot;Strictly in the Groove&quot; 
*1942: &quot;Riding Through Nevada&quot; 
*1943: &quot;Frontier Fury&quot; 
*1944: &quot;Cyclone Prairie Rangers&quot; 
*1947: &quot;Louisiana&quot; 
*1949: &quot;Mississippi Rhythm&quot; 
*1950: &quot;Square Dance Katy&quot;

<doc id="420817" wikidata="Q6338231" url="?curid=420817" title="KSTC-TV">
<text>KSTC-TV (channel 5.2) is an independent television station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, serving the Twin Cities area. Owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, it is sister to Saint Paul–licensed ABC affiliate and company flagship KSTP-TV (channel 5), and radio stations KSTP (1500 AM), KSTP-FM (94.5), and KTMY (107.1 FM). The five outlets share studios on University Avenue, on the Saint Paul–Minneapolis border; KSTC-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located at Telefarm Towers in Shoreview. The station is branded as 45TV in reference to its former analog, digital, and virtual channel number; it is still carried on channel 45 on some cable systems in outlying areas of the market, as well as on DirecTV and Dish Network.

KSTC-TV also serves the Mankato market (via K14KE-D in nearby St. James through the local municipal-operated Cooperative TV [CTV] network of translators), as that area does not have an independent station of its own.

KSTC-TV&#x27;s main signal is also seen on the second subchannel of both of KSTP-TV&#x27;s full-power satellite stations, KSAX (channel 42.2) in Alexandria, and KRWF (channel 43.2) in Redwood Falls; both stations carry KSTC-TV over-the-air in widescreen standard definition due to transmitter multiplexer limitations, though it is available in high definition on pay-TV services otherwise. KSTC-TV is also carried in high definition on KSTP-TV&#x27;s main signal and translator stations as a repeater signal, classed as KSTP-DT5.

KSTC-TV is the only television station in the area with its own mascot, Dr. Chuck Ells, who is often seen at community events. The former mascot was the &quot;45 Guy&quot;.

==History==
The station began operations under the KVBM call letters. Although Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records indicate that a license for this station was granted in 1987, it did not take to the airwaves until June 1994. The station aired Minnesota Department of Transportation traffic information as well as the Home Shopping Network (HSN) until it was purchased by Hubbard Broadcasting on April 24, 2000. Hubbard relaunched the station as KSTC on September 1. To get attention for the switch from KVBM to KSTC, Hubbard ran an advertising campaign around the theme of people with an assortment of ages saying &quot;I&#x27;m 45!&quot; to build word of mouth about what the phrase meant, knowing few in the market ever watched KVBM (or even knew a channel 45 existed) and would be curious about what the phrase actually referred to.

In 2003, KSTC began broadcasting its digital signal. KSTC-DT, on ATSC channel 45.1 in standard definition, simulcast the station&#x27;s regular content. On 45.2 was HDnet in high definition (the network&#x27;s only ever over-the-air presence outside of encrypted over-the-air subscription services). After its contract with the network ended, channel 45.2 was taken off-the-air. It signed-on again December 1, 2006, as a high definition sports channel which included a schedule of live Minnesota Wild and Minnesota Timberwolves games in the format, along with Minnesota State High School League sports. On or around June 30, 2010, KSTC began carrying This TV in standard definition, with KSTC&#x27;s main channel beginning to be transmitted in high definition with sports content merged into the main KSTC schedule.

Until late 2008, KSTC heavily promoted its ties to KSTP-TV. It branded itself as &quot;FORTY5,&quot; and used a logo in which the &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;FORTY&quot; was converted into a digital &quot;4&quot; superimposed on channel 5&#x27;s longtime &quot;groovy 5&quot; logo.

==Programming==

As an independent station, the station runs a variety of syndicated programming mostly consisting of off-network shows. Indeed, Hubbard signed on KSTC primarily as a home for a large inventory of syndicated programming that KSTP-TV no longer had time to air. Movies considered one and two-star are aired frequently while some locally produced material is aired each week. In the decades it has been operating under the KSTC call letters, several other low-budget programs made specifically for this station have come and gone. These included a weekly horror movie broadcast under the name &quot;Horror Incorporated&quot; (hosted by Count Dracula played by Jake Esau, the actual owner of the countdracula.com domain name). The last incarnation of &quot;Horror Incorporated&quot; was hosted by Uncle Ghoulie (Thom Lange), Carbuncle (Tim McCall), 13 (Sasha Yvonne Walloch), Gordon the Gorilla, and Wolfie. As of 2004, at least one KSTC-specific program was still airing: &quot;Nate on Drums&quot;, a comedy and variety show hosted by Nate Perbix, is reportedly syndicated to a network of stations across Minnesota.

Today, most local programs come from KSTP including &quot;On the Road&quot; with longtime KSTP reporter Jason Davis and &quot;Sports Wrap&quot;. In 2004, KSTC announced a six-year over-the-air partnership with the Minnesota Timberwolves allowing the station to broadcast a number of the team&#x27;s regular-season and postseason basketball games. Also that year, the station entered into an eleven-year partnership with the Minnesota State High School League to broadcast state athletic tournaments as well as educational and student programs. KSTC pays the league $9.7 million in rights fees and provides an additional $10.6 million worth of promotion for those tournaments and other league programs. KSTC-TV also televised Minnesota Golden Gophers men&#x27;s basketball games from 2006 to 2007.

In 2009, KSTC and the MSHSL extended their broadcast partnership until 2021. Starting in 2010, some tournaments were broadcast online. Additionally in December 2004, they established a multi-year partnership to air Minnesota Wild hockey games. Other sports have also aired on the station in the past including Minnesota Twins and Saint Paul Saints baseball, boxing, and even &quot;Robot Wars&quot;-style combat between mechanical competitors. As of summer 2006, KSTC has been including actual viewers in their programming promotions. Most include a viewer describing their favorite scene or character from one of the shows on the station. The station may also take on the responsibility of airing shows from ABC whenever KSTP cannot do so as a result of extended breaking news or severe weather coverage, or special programming.

==Newscasts==
In the early 2000s, KSTC experimented with carrying a two-hour extension of KSTP&#x27;s weekday morning newscast from 7 to 9 a.m., providing an all-local alternative to &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on channel 5. On July 19, 2009, KSTP began to produce daily newscasts for KSTC full-time. The newscasts run for two hours starting at 7 a.m. and hour-long noon newscast on weekdays and for an hour at 9 p.m, (a half-hour on Saturdays), which respectively compete with Fox owned-and-operated station KMSP-TV (channel 9)&#x27;s in-house morning newscast and KMSP&#x27;s prime time newscast at 9 p.m. In the late 2010s, the station also began to carry an hour-long noon newscast on weekdays from KSTP, along with the previous day&#x27;s edition of &quot;Twin Cities Live&quot; at 9 a.m.

==Technical information==

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KSTC-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 45, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 44 to channel 45. In October 2011, KSTP and KSTC unified all of their over-the-air channels as virtual subchannels of KSTP. As a result, the virtual channels of KSTC changed. The main KSTC channel is now on 5.2, with This TV now being tuned to 5.6.

On September 2, 2019, KSTC moved from physical channel 45 to 30 as part of the ongoing spectrum reallocation. The station continues to use the 45TV branding.

<text>WNYT (channel 13) is a television station licensed to Albany, New York, United States, serving the Capital District as an affiliate of NBC. It is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting alongside Pittsfield, Massachusetts–licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WNYA (channel 51). The two stations share studios on North Pearl Street in Menands (with an Albany postal address); WNYT&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Helderberg Escarpment west of New Salem.

==History==
The station began broadcasting on February 17, 1954, as CBS affiliate WTRI, licensed to Troy and broadcasting on UHF channel 35. The station was co-owned by Van Curler Broadcasting, a unit of the Stanley Warner Theaters chain, and Troy Broadcasting Company, owner of WTRY radio (AM 980, now WOFX). Van Curler operated the station. Its studio was located alongside its transmitter on Bald Mountain in the town of Brunswick, east of Troy. The station lost its CBS affiliation to Albany&#x27;s WROW-TV (channel 41, now WTEN on channel 10) in January 1955. Logically, it should have taken over WROW-TV&#x27;s ABC affiliation. However, ABC balked, forcing WTRI off the air. Van Curler purchased Troy Broadcasting&#x27;s stake in WTRI and returned the station to the air in 1956 as an ABC affiliate.

In 1958, Van Curler sought Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permission to move the license to Albany, on channel 13. By this time, the market had expanded to cover not only east-central New York, but also large swaths of southwestern Vermont and western Massachusetts. Not only is this market one of the largest east of the Mississippi River, but much of it is very mountainous. UHF stations have never covered large areas or rugged terrain very well. Van Curler thus jumped at a chance to move to the stronger VHF band. The FCC granted the request, and in December, the station took new call letters, WAST (for Albany, Schenectady, and Troy). Originally, the station had wanted to take the call sign WTAS (for Troy, Albany, and Schenectady) but the similarity of the letters &quot;TAS&quot; to the news agency of the Soviet Union (known as TASS) led to the use of WAST. As part of a dial realignment, WKTV in Utica moved from channel 13 to channel 2.

Shortly after the upgrade, WAST moved to a converted warehouse on the Albany–Menands line on North Pearl Street, which previously housed Selective Service records. Channel 13 still operates from this location today.

Despite the increased transmitter power, WAST&#x27;s signal was still significantly weaker in some portions of the Capital District market than its competitors, particularly in the southern portion. This was because as a condition of being allowed to move to the VHF band, it remained on its original transmitter on Bald Mountain (a legacy of the days when it was licensed to Troy) and used a somewhat directional signal to protect WNTA-TV (now WNET) in Newark, near New York City. The other stations in the market had their transmitters on the Helderberg Escarpment. This forced WAST to build several translators to expand its coverage. Combined with the fact it was affiliated with ABC, the smallest and weakest of the three major networks at the time (though ABC&#x27;s fortunes would improve considerably in the late 1970s), channel 13 was not really on par with rivals WTEN and then-General Electric-owned NBC affiliate WRGB (channel 6) until cable television arrived in the Capital District in the early 1970s. In 1968 Van Curler sold WAST to Sonderling Broadcasting, a radio company based in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois.

On October 23, 1977, the station switched affiliations with WTEN and became the Capital District&#x27;s CBS affiliate, returning the station to its original affiliation after 22 years. In 1978, the original iteration of Viacom announced its purchase of Sonderling Broadcasting&#x27;s holdings and made WAST the company&#x27;s second television station (after WVIT in New Britain, Connecticut) when the sale was finalized two years later, in March 1980. On September 28, 1981, WAST swapped affiliations again, this time with WRGB and became the area&#x27;s NBC affiliate. Seeking a fresh start and a new identity, Viacom decided to mark the affiliation change by adopting the current call sign of WNYT. It is one of the few stations in the United States to have been a primary affiliate of all of the big three networks.

Viacom&#x27;s 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures placed the company&#x27;s existing television stations (WNYT; WVIT; WHEC-TV in Rochester; KMOV in St. Louis; and KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana) under common ownership with Paramount&#x27;s broadcasting arm, the Paramount Stations Group; the two groups were formally consolidated in December 1995. Prior to the merger, Paramount announced the formation of the United Paramount Network (UPN), which started operating in January 1995; as early as 1994, Viacom was considering selling off its non-UPN stations. In June 1996, Viacom/Paramount agreed to trade WNYT and WHEC-TV to Hubbard Broadcasting in return for UPN affiliate WTOG in St. Petersburg, Florida.

WNYT signed-on its digital signal in October 2003 on VHF channel 12. Unlike the station&#x27;s analog signal, WNYT&#x27;s digital transmitter was located in the Helderberg tower farm with the market&#x27;s other stations. 

On February 25, 2013, Hubbard announced that it would purchase WNYA from Venture Technologies to form a duopoly with WNYT, for $2.3 million, pending FCC approval. Hubbard sought a failed station waiver to acquire the station; Venture had put WNYA up for sale in 2009, but no other potential buyers came forward. The sale did not include Class A repeater WNYA-CA which remained with Venture Technologies. Under a clause of the sale of WNYA that required WNYA-CA to use a new call sign that does not feature the letters &quot;N&quot; or &quot;Y&quot;, that station became WEPT-CA on March 8, 2013. On May 29, 2013, the FCC approved the sale of WNYA to Hubbard.

==News operation==
For many years, channel 13 ran a distant third in the area&#x27;s Nielsen ratings behind WRGB and WTEN. This was not only because it was the youngest station in the market, but also because of its signal reception issues. Under Viacom ownership, the station expanded and modernized its studios (newsroom, offices, etc., including the market&#x27;s first modern computers), becoming a factor in the Capital District ratings race for the first time. The company also made a significant investment in electronic equipment, including a satellite news truck. Investment in talent increased with the building of its own talent and by acquiring key personalities from other stations in the area. The station also benefited from the switch to NBC, giving its resurgent news operation a powerful lead-in as NBC rose to become the ratings leader for most of the second half of the 1980s.

WNYT overtook WTEN for the runner-up spot by the late-1980s, and in 1992, scored its first late news victory over longtime leader WRGB. Gradually, the station overtook WRGB, which had lost considerable momentum due to the retirement of longtime anchor Ernie Tetrault, in other time slots. In Viacom&#x27;s last sweeps period owning WNYT, the station won every time slot. It remained the overall market leader under Hubbard ownership until mid-2009 when it lost the late weeknight lead to WRGB in the May 2009 ratings period. In November 2009, WNYT&#x27;s weekday evening newscasts slipped to third place largely due to the station&#x27;s decision to terminate many of its popular personalities. Two years after Hubbard bought WNYT, it won the distinction of being the first and only station outside of New York City to win a regional Emmy Award for best newscast in New York State. With the re-branding of the station&#x27;s newscasts from &quot;News 13&quot; to &quot;NewsChannel 13&quot; in 1991, WNYT became the first station to use the &quot;Live. Local. Late Breaking.&quot; tag line slogan which is now commonplace throughout the country.

In the mid-1990s, the station began an alliance with PBS member station WMHT (channel 17). This led to WNYT producing several programs for the public broadcaster including semi-regular town hall meetings, the weekly call-in show &quot;Health LINK&quot; (which continues today), and for two years the market&#x27;s first 10 p.m. newscast on WMHT&#x27;s then-secondary station WMHQ (now WCWN). This production was canceled due to a lack of support. From 2001 until 2004, WNYT also maintained a joint sales agreement (JSA) with Pax affiliate WYPX-TV (channel 55) that included rebroadcasts of newscasts and other local non-news programming.

In 2001, WNYT opened the Berkshire County Bureau on South Church Street in Downtown Pittsfield to cover the Massachusetts side of the market. At that time, the bureau was the first of a Capital District station. The Berkshire County Bureau began to be staffed only on an occasional basis in 2009, and subsequently closed altogether as a result of the 2008 recession, though the station still covers Berkshire County. WCDC (a dark full-time satellite of rival WTEN), had never established any sort of physical presence in the Berkshires despite being licensed in the region before it shut down in 2017 (specifically, Adams). With the acquisition of WNYA, Hubbard has indicated that it would produce newscasts on WNYA with an increased emphasis on news from Berkshire County. It remains to be seen whether this will include any new physical presence (i.e. a news bureau or a full studio) of WNYA and WNYT in the local area.

A newscast airing on WNYA finally premiered September 16, 2013, and is known on-air as &quot;NewsChannel 13 Live at 10 on My 4 Albany&quot;. The show airs weeknights for a half-hour in a fast-paced format and includes a &quot;Berkshire Moment&quot; segment featuring western Massachusetts headlines powered by &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot;. It competes with the firmly established sixty-minute broadcast seen every night on Fox affiliate WXXA-TV (produced by WTEN) and another thirty-minute news show on WCWN (a weeknight-only production by WRGB).

After forging an alliance with the &quot;Glens Falls Post-Star&quot;, the Saratoga/North Country Bureau was opened on Broadway/NY 50/US 9 in Downtown Saratoga Springs in early 2004. In December 2005, WNYT began broadcasting NBC Weather Plus on its second digital subchannel with a full launch coming two months later on Time Warner Cable digital channel 556. In the late 2000s, WNYT briefly replaced its weekday noon news with an hour-long broadcast at 11 a.m. entitled &quot;Midday&quot;. On April 24, 2012, WNYT became the third station in Albany to launch newscasts in high definition. Although three other Hubbard-owned stations have already been broadcasting their local news shows in 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen, WNYT is only the second Hubbard-owned station (after company flagship KSTP-TV in St. Paul, Minnesota) to have made the upgrade to full high definition level. The station operates its own Doppler weather radar, known on-air as &quot;NewsChannel 13 First Warning Live Doppler&quot; at its former analog transmitter site on Bald Mountain.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WNYT shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 12, using virtual channel 13.

===Translators===
WNYT operates five additional repeaters. Until the early 1990s, it maintained a translator in Kingston (in the New York City market). This was first located on channel 63 but moved to channel 36 after the launch of WTZA in 1985. The translators were all built because WNYT&#x27;s analog signal was not as strong as the other major television stations in the Capital District (see above). The Adams, Gloversville and Pittsfield translators have since been converted from analog to digital. The Glens Falls and Troy repeaters are licensed under the WNYT call sign but designated as low-power digital replacement translators.
* Gloversville, NY
* Pittsfield, MA
* North Adams, MA
* 28 Glens Falls, NY
* 27 Troy, NY

====Former translators====
* W07AG Rutland, VT
* W07AI Pittsfield, MA
* W07AV Gloversville, NY
* W38DL Adams, MA
* W55AN Frankfort, NY
* W63AA Kingston, NY

<text>WHEC-TV (channel 10) is a television station in Rochester, New York, United States, affiliated with NBC. Owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, the station maintains studios on East Avenue in Downtown Rochester and a transmitter on Pinnacle Hill in Brighton.

==History==

In March 1953, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded the construction permit of Rochester&#x27;s second VHF station to two local firms who competed for the open channel. In what was the first arrangement of its kind, the Gannett Company, then the Rochester-based publisher of the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Times-Union&quot; and owners of CBS Radio Network affiliate WHEC (1460 AM, now WHIC); and the Veterans Broadcasting Company, owners of WVET radio (1280 AM, now WHTK), were granted shared operation of channel 10; the two separately owned stations would use the same broadcast license and transmitter, but broadcast from separate studios.

Both stations–Veterans-owned WVET-TV, based at the Central Trust Building; and Gannett-owned WHEC-TV, with studios at the Rochester Savings Bank building, both in downtown Rochester–commenced operations on November 1, 1953. The combined channel 10 operation carried a primary affiliation with the CBS Television Network, and also carried ABC programs on a secondary basis. The WHEC stations moved from the Bank of Rochester building to WHEC-TV&#x27;s present location, on East Avenue, in May 1958.

On November 15, 1961, the split-channel, shared-time arrangement ended as Veterans sold its half of channel 10 to Gannett. Veterans subsequently acquired its own, fully owned station, WROC-TV (then on channel 5) from Transcontinent Broadcasting. The completion of the deal made WHEC-TV the sole occupant of the channel 10 frequency in Rochester. The following year WHEC-TV became a full-time CBS affiliate, as the ABC affiliation moved to newly signed-on WOKR (channel 13, now WHAM-TV). In 1966, channel 10 was one of the founding members of the &quot;Love Network&quot; that aired the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; every Labor Day until 2012, when it moved from first-run syndication to ABC as a short-form telecast and was renamed the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot;, and ended in 2014 when MDA discontinued the event on May 1, 2015. WHEC-TV was the creator of the &quot;cut-ins&quot; that local stations insert into the national telethon, a concept that later since spread across the country.

Gannett split up its radio/TV holdings in 1971 when WHEC radio was sold to Sande Broadcasting, a locally based group (the station is now known as WHIC). Channel 10 was allowed to retain the WHEC-TV call letters and would remain as the Gannett Company&#x27;s lone broadcast holding until 1979 when Gannett sold the station in the wake of its purchase of Combined Communications. Gannett feared the FCC, who several years earlier decided to eliminate several small-market print/broadcast ownership combinations, would force it to sell either the television station or the newspaper. Gannett netted a handsome return on its purchase of WHEC radio in 1932. It retained both the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Times-Union&quot;, the latter of which was merged into the former in 1997. Gannett continues to publish the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; as of 2020, though the company relocated its headquarters from Rochester to the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. in 1985.

The new owners of channel 10, made U.S. television history: WHEC-TV became the first VHF, network-affiliated station to be purchased and wholly owned by an African-American group, led by investor Ragan Henry. Despite the historical connotation, the Henry-led group&#x27;s stewardship of WHEC-TV would be short-lived. In 1983, the Henry group traded channel 10 to the original Viacom in exchange for a pair of radio stations, WDIA in Memphis and KDIA (now KMKY) in Oakland.

Under Viacom ownership, channel 10 took part in another trade—this one the first (and only) network affiliation switch in Rochester. On April 6, 1989, WHEC-TV announced that it would join the NBC network, replacing WROC-TV (now on channel 8) in the Peacock Network&#x27;s roster. This move was the result of WROC-TV&#x27;s poor performance and constant preemptions of NBC network programming (NBC was very intolerant of preemptions at this time). The swap brought channel 10 in-line with sister stations WNYT in Albany and WVIT in New Britain, Connecticut, which had recently renewed their NBC relationships. In addition, NBC&#x27;s strong prime time programming—NBC was the most-watched network at the time, while CBS was in a distant third near the midpoint of the Laurence Tisch era—was another major factor. WROC-TV began airing Saturday morning programs and some daytime programs from CBS shortly after WHEC-TV announced its intent to affiliate with NBC, but the network switch did not take effect until August 13, 1989, which was the day after WHEC-TV&#x27;s affiliation contract with CBS expired.

Viacom purchased Paramount Pictures in 1994, placing its five-station group (WHEC-TV, WNYT, WVIT, KMOV in St. Louis, and KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana) under common ownership with the Paramount Stations Group; the two groups were formally consolidated in December 1995. Shortly thereafter, the merged company decided to divest itself of all of its major network affiliates to focus on stations that carried its then-upstart United Paramount Network (UPN). In June 1996, Viacom/Paramount agreed to trade WHEC-TV and WNYT to Hubbard Broadcasting in return for UPN affiliate WTOG in St. Petersburg, Florida; WVIT wound up being purchased outright by NBC.

==News operation==
WHEC-DT airs more than 33 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).

The WHEC news team won the New York Emmy Award for best newscast in April 2018 and the National Edward R. Murrow award for Best Newscast in June 2018.

===Notable former on-air staff===
*Rich Funke – reporter/anchor (1974–2012). Served as Republican 55th District New York State Senator (2015–2020).
*Steve Scully – anchor, reporter (1980s). Now with C-SPAN.

==Controversy==
On November 21, 1982, WHEC-TV was the subject of a controversial decision when then-general manager Steven Kronquest decided to air a pre-recorded high school football championship game on the station instead of the New York Giants–Washington Redskins NFL game that was televised live by CBS. The decision angered many Giants fans in the region and cost the station around $3,600. However, the game would air that day on rival station and ABC affiliate WOKR with permission from CBS and the NFL.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WHEC-TV&#x27;s digital signal on UHF channel 58 signed-on September 27, 2002, under a special temporary authority. 

WHEC-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 58, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 10.

==Coverage in Canada==
For many years, WHEC-TV was one of three Rochester area stations offered on cable in the Ottawa–Gatineau and Eastern Ontario regions. The Rochester area stations were replaced with Detroit stations when the microwave relay system that provided these signals was discontinued. WHEC-TV and other Rochester stations were available on cable in several communities along the north shore of Lake Ontario such as Belleville and Cobourg, Ontario. All Rochester affiliates with the exception of Fox affiliate WUHF (channel 31) were replaced with Buffalo stations in January 2009.

<text>KOBF (channel 12) is a television station licensed to Farmington, New Mexico, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is a satellite of Albuquerque-based KOB (channel 4) which is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. KOBF&#x27;s transmitter is located south of Farmington on NM 371.

KOBR (channel 8) in Roswell also serves as a satellite of KOB. These satellite operations provide additional news bureaus for KOB and sell advertising time to local sponsors.

KOBF has repeated KOB since 1983, when Hubbard acquired it from the last of several owners of KIVA-TV, a small local station that was also an NBC affiliate.

==History==
===KIVA-TV===
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated channel 12 to Farmington in 1957 at the request of Farmington Broadcasting Company, a corporation affiliated with the local cable firm which proposed to build a station that would attempt to seek affiliation with all three major networks. This application was then merged with another from Farmington radio station KVBC.

No station ever materialized, and it was not until 1970 that another bid on the channel was made, this time by Woodland Broadcasting, which owned radio station KUBC in Montrose, Colorado. By this time, channel 12 was used by KOB-TV translator K12GK, which was located on Caviness Mountain near Mancos, Colorado. Woodland&#x27;s application for a construction permit was granted by the FCC on October 27, 1971.

Before the station was built, Woodland transferred the construction permit to Four States Television, Inc. The transmitter tower was built on the bluffs south of town, and KIVA-TV, an NBC affiliate, began broadcasting on the afternoon of October 20, 1972. It received network programs from KOA-TV, then the NBC affiliate in Denver, because KOB-TV did not grant permission for the new station to use its NBC feed. Originally broadcasting with 38,000 watts, KIVA-TV was approved to increase to an effective radiated power of 230,000 watts in 1974. That same year, sale of a minority interest in channel 12 to Allen Theatres and sales manager Marty Ball was announced; this fell through the next year, forcing general manager Jerry Proctor to postpone his plans to move to Houston and build a cable system there.

A group of five Houston investors led by John Catsis acquired KIVA-TV in 1976 and closed on the deal in January 1977; they promised to add a local news department to the station with two full-time reporters. In addition, they pledged to tackle &quot;picture reliability&quot; and network feed issues that plagued KIVA-TV&#x27;s telecast of network programming.

The Catsis group sold KIVA-TV in 1981 to Center Group Broadcasting, whose primary shareholder was Alfred Burke and which also counted Stephen Adams among its stockholders, for $1.2 million and the assumption of up to $700,000 in debt. Center Group had its own plans for expanding the studio facilities and the news staff. However, it had to deal with a balky and &quot;very old&quot; transmitter that was prone to failing and taking the station out for days at a time. One of the failures was late in the fourth quarter of a football game; with the game tied, the station&#x27;s electronic equipment switched automatically to another game, resulting in angry phone calls and even a bomb threat. Dale Palmer, who owned part of Center Group and was the second general manager under the company&#x27;s ownership, noted that, while the company specialized in turning around broadcast properties, it had received &quot;bad advice&quot; about KIVA-TV, noting, &quot;Essentially, all we got was a license and a building&quot;.

===KOBF===
In April 1983, an unexpected offer turned around KIVA-TV&#x27;s hard luck. It came from KOB-TV, which was anxious to improve its circulation statewide and challenge KOAT-TV for first place in the New Mexico television news ratings. At the time, there were three NBC affiliates in New Mexico: KSWS-TV in Roswell, KIVA-TV, and KOB-TV; the former two stations prevented KOB-TV from broadcasting into southeastern and northwestern New Mexico. Hubbard Broadcasting reached a deal to buy the Roswell station and then offered $3.6 million for KIVA-TV, which Adams accepted within eight minutes.

Hubbard, like other buyers before it, was buying a fixer-upper, a station that had &quot;[n]ever made a nickel&quot; in its history. It promised to infuse as much money as needed to turn the station around technically and in its local productions; ground was broken in November 1983 on a new studio facility at Lake and Broadway streets. Bettie Sue Cleveland, appointed general manager by Hubbard, became the first woman to hold that post at a New Mexico television station; she died in 1990.

Local news at the conversion to satellite operation in 1983 consisted of one-minute news updates in prime time and cut-ins during &quot;The Today Show&quot;. KOBF debuted an expanded news service in 1989, which included news inserts into KOB&#x27;s newscasts that covered the Four Corners region. By 1996, KOBF aired a 16-minute insert into KOB&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast and a 22-minute insert into its 10 p.m. program. Young reporters often learned the ropes of the television news business in Farmington, setting up, shooting and reporting their own stories.

On March 1, 2007, most of the extra news and all of the extra sports content was ended for viewers of KOBF. KOB management fired three of the four members of the news department, retaining one reporter/photographer. The decision was made due to stagnating national advertising revenue in the New Mexico television market.

KOBF ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 17 to VHF channel 12.

<text>Wind chimes are a type of percussion instrument constructed from suspended tubes, rods, bells, or other objects that are often made of metal or wood. The tubes or rods are suspended along with some type of weight or surface which the tubes or rods can strike when they or another wind-catching surface are blown by the natural movement of air outside. 

They are usually hung outside of a building or residence as a visual and aural garden ornament. Since the percussion instruments are struck according to the random effects of the wind blowing the chimes, wind chimes have been considered an example of chance-based music. The tubes or rods may sound either indistinct pitches, or fairly distinct pitches. Wind chimes that sound fairly distinct pitches can, through the chance movement of air, create simple songs or broken chords.
==History==

===Ancient Rome===

Roman wind chimes, usually made of bronze, were called &quot;tintinnabula&quot; and were hung in gardens, courtyards, and porticoes where wind movement caused them to tinkle. Bells were believed to ward off malevolent spirits and were often combined with a phallus, which was also a symbol of good fortune and a charm against the evil eye. The image shows one example with a phallus portrayed with wings and the feet of an animal, and a phallus for a tail. These additions increased its protective powers.

===Eastern and Southern Asia===

In India during the second century CE, and later in China, extremely large pagodas became popular with small wind bells hung at each corner; the slightest breeze caused the clapper to swing, made in bronze too, producing a melodious tinkling. It is said that these bells were originally intended to frighten away not only birds but also any lurking evil spirits. Wind bells are also hung under the corners of temple, palace and home roofs; they are not limited to pagodas. Japanese glass wind bells known as &quot;fūrin&quot; (風鈴) have been produced since the Edo period, and those at Mizusawa Station are one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan. Wind chimes are thought to be good luck in parts of Asia and are used in Feng Shui.

Wind chimes started to become modernized around 1100 C.E. after the Chinese began to cast bells. A bell without a clapper, called a &quot;yong-zhong&quot;, was crafted by skilled metal artisans and primarily used in religious ceremonies. Afterwards, the Chinese created the &quot;feng-ling&quot;(), which is similar to today&#x27;s modern wind bell. Feng-lings were hung from shrines and pagodas to ward off evil spirits and attract benevolent ones. Today, wind chimes are common in the East and used to maximize the flow of chi, or life&#x27;s energy.

==Sounds and music==

Chimes produce inharmonic (as opposed to harmonic) spectra, although if they are hung at about 2/9 of their length (22.4%), some of the higher partials are damped and the fundamental rings the loudest. This is common practice in high-quality wind chimes, which are also usually hung so the centre ball strikes the centre of the wind chime&#x27;s length, also resulting in the loudest sounding fundamental. Frequency is determined by the length, width, thickness, and material. There are formulas that help predict the proper length to achieve a particular note, though a bit of fine tuning is often needed.

Most chimes employ pentatonic or tetratonic scales as the basis for the pitches of their individual chimes as opposed to the traditional western heptatonic scale. This is largely due to the fact that these scales inherently contain fewer dissonant intervals, and therefore sound more pleasant to the average listener when notes are struck at random.

In instruments such as organ pipes, the pitch is determined primarily by the length of the air column, because it is the resonance of the air column that generates the sound. The pipe material helps determine the &quot;timbre&quot; or &quot;voice&quot; of the pipe, but the air column determines the pitch. In a wind chime, the vibrations of the pipe itself radiate the sound after being struck, so the air column has little to do with the pitch being produced.

Sound can be produced when the tubes or rods come in contact with a suspended central clapper in the form of a ball or horizontal disk, or with each other.

Wind chimes may be used to observe changes in wind direction, depending on where they are hung when they commence to sound.

==Materials==
Wind chimes can be made of materials other than metal or wood and in shapes other than tubes or rods. Other wind chimes materials include glass, bamboo, shell, stone, earthenware, stoneware, beads, keys and porcelain. More exotic items, such as silverware or cookie cutters, can also be recycled to create wind chimes. The selected material can have a large effect on the sound a wind chime produces. The sounds produced by recycling objects such as these are not tunable to specific notes and range from pleasant tinkling to dull thuds. The sounds produced by properly sized wind chime tubes are tunable to notes. As aluminum is the common metal with the lowest internal damping, wind chimes are often made from aluminum to achieve the longest and loudest sounding chime.

The tone depends on factors such as the material, the exact alloy, heat treatment, and whether a solid cylinder or a tube is used. If a tube is used, the wall thickness also affects the tone. Tone may also depend on the hanging method. The tone quality also depends on the material of the object that is used to hit the chimes.

With clay wind chimes, the higher the final firing temperature, the brighter and more ringing the resulting tone. Earthenware clay fired at lower temperatures produces a duller sound than stoneware clay fired at higher temperatures. Stoneware wind chimes are also more durable and able to resist stronger winds without suffering chipping or damage.

== Mathematics of tubular wind chimes ==

A wind chime constructed of a circular tube may be modelled as a freely vibrating Euler–Bernoulli beam and the dominant frequency in cycles per second is given by:

:formula_1

where &quot;L&quot; is the length of the tube, &quot;E&quot; is the Young&#x27;s modulus for the tube material, &quot;I&quot; is the second moment of area of the tube, and μ is the mass per unit length of the tube. Young&#x27;s modulus &quot;E&quot; is a constant for a given material. If the inner radius of the tube is &quot;ri&quot; and the outer radius is &quot;ro&quot;, then the second moment of area for an axis perpendicular to the axis of the tube is:

:formula_2

The mass per unit length is:

:formula_3

where ρ is the density of the tube material. The frequency is then

:formula_4

where &quot;W=ro-ri&quot; is the wall thickness and &quot;D&quot; is the average diameter &quot;D=ro+ri&quot;.
For sufficiently thin-walled tubes the &quot;W2&quot; term may be neglected, and for a given material, the main frequency is inversely proportional to &quot;L&quot;2 and proportional to the diameter &quot;D&quot;.

For the main mode of vibration, there will be two nodes on the tube, where the tube is motionless during the vibration. These nodes will be located at a distance of 22.416% of the length of the tube from each end of the tube. If the tube is simply supported (not clamped) at one or both of these nodes, the tube will vibrate as if these supports did not exist. A wind chime will give the clearest and loudest tone when it is hung using one of these node points as the attachment point. These attachment points are also the same as used by other similar instrument such as the xylophone and glockenspiel.

==Use in music==

Different types of wind chimes have also been used in modern music and are listed as a percussion instrument. The following is a brief list of artists and composers who have used them:
* Olivier Messiaen: &quot;Saint-François d&#x27;Assise&quot; (one set of glass, shell and wood chimes)
* Toshiro Mayuzumi: &quot;Bugaku&quot; (one set of wood and glass chimes)
* Giles Swayne Symphony No. 1 (one set of glass chimes)
* David Sitek, of American rock band TV on the Radio, sometimes hangs a wind chime from the end of his guitar to add texture to his music.
* Koji Kondo, head composer for the Mario series of video games. A prime example is the theme music for the world &quot;Vanilla Dome&quot; in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.
* Ivy Queen, on the acoustic track &quot;Ángel Caído&quot; from the 2004 album &quot;Real&quot;.

==Influence==
* The Japanese video game franchise &quot;Pokémon&quot; used the Japanese &quot;fūrin&quot; wind chimes as the basis for the Pokémon Chimecho. Its in-game cry reflects this, as it sounds like three high-pitched bells chiming one after the other.
* Mark trees are often mistakenly called wind chimes, but they are different instruments, though with a basic similar structure consisting of tubes of differing lengths that are meant to produce a tinkling or chiming sound.

<doc id="420835" wikidata="Q304403" url="?curid=420835" title="Operation Biting">
<text>Operation Biting, also known as the Bruneval Raid, was a British Combined Operations raid on a German coastal radar installation at Bruneval in northern France, during the Second World War, on the night .

Several of these installations were identified from Royal Air Force (RAF) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941, but the purpose and the nature of the equipment was not known. Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with successful German attacks on RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe, resulting in severe losses of pilots and bombers. The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and, if possible, extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination.

Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the installation from a seaborne raid, the British believed that a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the enemy to destroy the installation. Officials decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.

On the night of 27 February, after a period of intense training and several delays due to poor weather, a company of airborne troops under the command of Major John Frost parachuted into France a few miles from the installation. The main force assaulted the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief firefight.

An RAF technician with the force dismantled a Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces, after which the force withdrew to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had initially failed to do so, but the German force guarding it was soon eliminated with the help of the main force. The raiding troops were picked up by landing craft, and transferred to several motor gunboats, which returned them to Britain.

The raid was entirely successful. The airborne troops suffered relatively few casualties, and the pieces of the radar they brought back, along with a captured German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures to neutralize them.

== Background ==
After the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo, much of Britain&#x27;s war production and effort was channelled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing offensive against Germany. However, bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941, which British intelligence concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment.

The British and Germans had been competing in radar technology for nearly a decade at this point, with the German technology often at the same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of the Second World War, Britain had devised effective radar systems, primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, although much of the technology was still rudimentary and Watson-Watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German night-time bombing of Britain during 1940.

Another British scientist working on radar systems and techniques was R. V. Jones, who had been appointed in 1939 as Britain&#x27;s first scientific intelligence officer, and had spent the first years of the conflict researching how advanced German radar was in comparison to Britain, convincing doubters that the Germans had radar.
By examining leaked German documents, crashed bombers and Enigma decryptions, and through German prisoner of war interrogations, Jones discovered that high-frequency radio signals were being transmitted across Britain from somewhere on the Continent, and he believed they came from a directional radar system. Within a few months of this discovery, Jones had identified several such radar systems, one of which was being used to detect British bombers; this was known as the &quot;Freya-Meldung-Freya&quot; array, named after the ancient Norse goddess. 

Jones was finally able to see concrete proof of the presence of the Freya system after being shown several mysterious objects visible in reconnaissance pictures taken by the RAF near Cap d&#x27;Antifer in Normandy – two circular emplacements in each of which was a rotating &quot;mattress&quot; antenna approximately wide. Having found proof of these Freya installations, Jones and the other scientists under his command could begin devising countermeasures against the system, and the RAF could begin to locate and destroy the installations themselves.

Jones also found evidence of a second part of the Freya set-up, referred to in Enigma decrypts as &quot;Würzburg&quot;, but it was not until he was shown another set of RAF reconnaissance photographs in November 1941 that he learned the nature of Würzburg. The Würzburg radar device consisted of a parabolic antenna about in diameter, which worked in conjunction with Freya to locate British bombers and then direct night fighters to attack them. The two systems complemented each other: Freya was a long-range early-warning radar system but lacked precision, and Würzburg had a much shorter range but was far more precise. Würzburg FuSE 62 D, also had the advantage of being much smaller than the Freya system and easier to manufacture in the quantities needed by the to defend German territory.

=== Prelude === 
To neutralise the Würzburg system by developing countermeasures against it, Jones and his team needed to study one of the systems or at least the more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed. One site had recently been sighted by an RAF reconnaissance Spitfire from the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit during a flight over part of the French English Channel coast near Le Havre.

The site was found on a clifftop immediately north of the village of Bruneval, north of Le Havre, and was the most accessible German radar site that had been found so far by the British; several other installations were further inland and others were as far away as Romania and Bulgaria. A request for a raid on the Bruneval site to capture a Würzburg system was passed on to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Combined Operations. Mountbatten, in turn, took the proposal to the Chiefs of Staff Committee, who approved the raid after a brief debate.

Having received permission to conduct the raid, Mountbatten and his staff studied the Bruneval installation and its defences, rapidly concluding that due to the extensive coastal defences in the area around the installation, it was too well-guarded to permit a seaborne commando raid. They considered that such a raid would result in high casualties among the attacking troops and would not be fast enough to capture the Würzburg radar before it was destroyed by the Germans. 

Believing that surprise and speed were to be the essential requirements of any raid against the installation to ensure the radar was captured, Mountbatten saw an airborne assault as the only viable method. On 8 January 1942, he therefore contacted the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division and 38 Wing RAF, asking if they were able to conduct the raid. The division&#x27;s commander, Major-General Frederick Browning, was particularly enthusiastic, as a successful operation would be an excellent morale boost to the airborne troops under his command, as well as a good demonstration of their value.
The two commanders believed that training by airborne troops and aircrews could be completed by the end of February when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for the operation. Training for the raid was begun immediately, but encountered several problems. 38 Wing was a new unit still in the process of formation, so No. 51 Squadron RAF under Wing Commander Percy Charles Pickard was selected to provide the aircraft and aircrew needed for the operation, although Group Captain Nigel Norman of 38 Wing would remain in overall command. Another problem encountered was the state of training of the unit of airborne troops chosen to raid the installation.

During this period, the 1st Airborne Division was composed of only two parachute battalions, of which only one (1st Parachute Battalion), was fully trained. Browning, wishing to keep the 1st Parachute Battalion intact for any larger operation the division might be selected for, ordered the 2nd Parachute Battalion to provide a company for the operation. &#x27;C&#x27; Company commanded by Frost was selected but the company had been so recently formed that Frost and many of his men had not yet completed their parachute jumping course.

The level of security imposed on the planning for the raid was so high that when Frost was first briefed by a liaison officer from the headquarters of the 1st Airborne Division, he was informed that his company was to take part in an airborne warfare demonstration for the War Cabinet. He was also informed that C Company would be divided into four sections for the exercise, which was contrary to a plan Frost had devised for the exercise and confused him. It was only after Frost raised several objections with a more senior officer at headquarters that he was informed of the intended raid, after which he dropped his objections and turned his attention to training the company.

=== Training ===
The company spent time on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire and then travelled to Inveraray in Scotland where they underwent specialised training on Loch Fyne, practising night embarkations on landing craft to prepare the company for evacuation by sea after raiding the radar installation. After this, the unit returned to Wiltshire and began carrying out practice parachute drops with the aircraft and aircrews of 51 Squadron.

Despite the aircrews having no previous experience in dropping parachutists, these exercises proved to be successful. The company&#x27;s working-up was aided by the creation of a scale model of the radar installation and the surrounding buildings being built by the Photographic Interpretation Unit. During this period, Major Frost was introduced to Commander F. N. Cook of the Royal Australian Navy who would be commanding the naval force intended to evacuate the company after the raid, as well as to the detachment of 32 officers and men from No. 12 Commando who would arrive in the landing craft and cover the company as it withdrew from the beach.

Frost also met RAF Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox, who had volunteered to accompany C Company for the operation; as an expert radio electronics technician, it would be his job to locate the Würzburg radar set, photograph it, and dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain. Derek Garrard of Jones&#x27; team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox, as he would be the object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform, but the War Office were obdurate.

Accompanying the strike force was a 10-man section of Royal Engineers of the 1st Air Troop led by Lt. Dennis Vernon. Six of the sappers would dismantle the radar device whilst four sappers would plant anti-tank mines to protect the force from counter attack.
Information about the Bruneval radar installation was also gathered during this period, often with the help of the French Resistance, without whom detailed knowledge of the disposition of the German forces guarding the installation would have been impossible. This information was gathered by Gilbert Renault, known to the British by the code-name &#x27;Rémy&#x27;, and several members of his resistance network.

The installation was composed of two distinct areas; a villa approximately from the edge of a cliff which contained the radar station itself, and an enclosure containing several smaller buildings which contained a small garrison. The Würzburg antenna was erected between the villa and the cliff. The radar station was permanently manned by radar technicians and was surrounded by guard posts and approximately 30 guards; the buildings in the small enclosure housed about 100 German troops, including another detachment of technicians. A platoon of German infantry was stationed to the south in Bruneval, and was responsible for manning the defences guarding the evacuation beach; these included a strongpoint near the beach as well as pillboxes and machine gun nests on the top of the cliff overlooking the beach. The beach was not land mined and had only sporadic barbed-wire defences, but it was patrolled regularly; a mobile reserve of infantry was believed to be available at one hour&#x27;s notice and stationed some distance inland.

Based on this information, Frost decided to divide the company into five groups of 40 men for the raid, each named after a famous Royal Navy admiral: &#x27;Nelson&#x27;, &#x27;Jellicoe&#x27;, &#x27;Hardy&#x27;, &#x27;Drake&#x27; and &#x27;Rodney&#x27;. &#x27;Nelson&#x27; would clear and secure German positions defending the evacuation beach, whilst &#x27;Jellicoe&#x27;, &#x27;Hardy&#x27; and &#x27;Drake&#x27; would capture the radar site, villa and the enclosure. &#x27;Rodney&#x27; was the reserve formation, placed between the radar site and the main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack.

It was considered that the combination of a full moon for visibility, and a rising tide to allow the landing craft to manoeuvre in shallow water, was vital for the success of the raid, which narrowed the possible dates to four days between 24 and 27 February. On 23 February, a final rehearsal exercise took place, which proved to be a failure; despite ideal weather conditions, the evacuation landing craft grounded offshore and could not be shifted despite the efforts of the crews and troops.

== The raid ==

The raid was postponed for several days after the 23 February rehearsal due to weather conditions, but on 27 February the weather proved to be ideal, with clear skies and good visibility for the aircraft of 51 Squadron, and a full moon which would provide illumination for the evacuation of the raiding force. The naval force under Commander Cook departed from Britain during the afternoon and the Whitley transport aircraft carrying C Company took off from RAF Thruxton in the evening.

The aircraft crossed the English Channel without incident, but as they reached the French coast they came under heavy anti-aircraft fire; however, none of them were hit, and they successfully delivered C Company to the designated drop zone near the installation. The drop was an almost total success, with the majority of the raiding force landing on the edge of the drop zone; however, half of the &#x27;Nelson&#x27; detachment landed short of the DZ. Once the other detachments had gathered their equipment and oriented themselves, they moved off to undertake their arranged tasks.

&#x27;Jellicoe&#x27;, &#x27;Hardy&#x27; and &#x27;Drake&#x27; encountered no enemy opposition as they moved towards the villa housing the radar installation, and after surrounding the villa Frost gave the order to open fire with grenades and automatic fire. One German guard was killed as he returned fire from an upstairs window, and two more were taken prisoner by the airborne troops; upon interrogation, the prisoners revealed that the majority of the garrison were stationed further inland. There still remained a substantial enemy force in the buildings in the small enclosure near the villa, and this now opened fire on the raiding force after being alerted by the initial firefight, killing one of the airborne troops.

The volume of fire rapidly increased, when enemy vehicles could be seen moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this, in particular, worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including &#x27;Nelson&#x27; who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.

Having secured the radar equipment and under heavy enemy fire, Frost gave the order for the three detachments to withdraw to the evacuation beach; it became apparent, however, that the beach had not been secured by the under-strength &#x27;Nelson&#x27; detachment when a German machine gun opened fire on the airborne troops, severely wounding the company sergeant major. Frost ordered &#x27;Rodney&#x27; and the available men of &#x27;Nelson&#x27; to clear the defences, whilst he led the other three detachments back to the villa, which had been reoccupied by enemy troops. (see also chapter in &#x27;Fighting Back&#x27; by Martin Sugarman on the role of German Jewish refugee Commando and Paratrooper Peter Nagel aka Newman, on the raid, and reference to the Yorks TV 1977 documentary film on the raid which includes interviews with Frost, Cox, Nagel and other survivors, and another film held by the IWM, London made in 1982)

The villa was soon cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost returned to the beach, he found that the machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of &#x27;Nelson&#x27;; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 but there was no sign of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered &#x27;Nelson&#x27; to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that, the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.

This deviation from the original evacuation plan and the enemy fire caused considerable confusion on the beach; some of the landing craft left the beach over-crowded, whilst others left half-empty. However, the radar equipment, German prisoners and all but six of the raiding force were embarked and transferred to motor gunboats for transport back to Britain. On the return journey, Frost learned that the naval force had received no signals apart from the signal flare, and had spent much of the time hiding from a German naval patrol that had nearly discovered them. The journey back to Britain was uneventful, with the force being escorted by four destroyers and a flight of Spitfires.

The paratroopers lost two killed, eight wounded and six men who did not return to the boats. They were later taken prisoner by the Germans. German reports were found after the war, which made the German loss as follows: the army: two killed, one seriously wounded, two missing. : three killed, one wounded, three missing. A member of the French resistance movement who had participated in the previous reconnaissance in Bruneval was subsequently captured and executed by the Germans. A Frenchman and his fiancée were deported to concentration camps in Germany for providing help to surviving British paratroopers in their attempt to return to the UK.

== Aftermath ==
The success of the raid against the Bruneval installation had two important effects. First, a successful raid against German-occupied territory was a welcome morale boost for the British public, and featured prominently in the British media for several weeks afterwards. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, took a personal interest in the operation, and on 3 March assembled the War Cabinet to hear from Frost and several other officers who had participated in it. Several medals were awarded as a result.

On 15 May 1942 a special supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; carried the announcement of 19 decorations; Frost was awarded the Military Cross (MC), Cook the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Cox the Military Medal (MM); there were two other DSCs, two Distinguished Service Medals (DSM), one other MC, two further MMs and nine Mentions in Despatches (MiD). Wing Commander Pickard was also subsequently awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order, on 26 May. The success of the raid also prompted the War Office to expand the existing British airborne forces, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions to airborne battalions in August 1942.

The second and most important result of the raid was the technical knowledge that British scientists gained. Examination of the components of the radar array showed that it was of a modular design that aided maintenance and made fixing faults far simpler than on similar British radar models. This was confirmed during the interrogation of the captured German technician, who proved to be less well trained than his British counterparts.

Examination of the radar array also allowed British scientists to conclude that they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it could be tuned to a wide range of frequencies, making it difficult to jam by the conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict. Thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); the bombers used Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature. Based on what was learned in the raid, a tunable jammer aimed specifically at Würzburg (Carpet) would later be deployed, hampering German efforts to adapt to Window.
An unexpected bonus of the Bruneval raid was the Germans&#x27; efforts to improve defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks. The radars were surrounded by rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to attack prior to Operation Overlord. The Telecommunications Research Establishment, where much of the Bruneval equipment was analysed and where British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern, to ensure that it would not become the target of a reprisal raid by German airborne forces. The original model of the area around the radar station, used to brief troops taking part in the assault, is preserved in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum, at the Imperial War Museum Duxford.

<doc id="420837" wikidata="Q17069284" url="?curid=420837" title="Music of Togo">
<text>The music of [[Togo]] has produced a number of internationally known popular entertainers including Bella Bellow, Akofah Akussah, Afia Mala, Itadi Bonney, Wellborn, King Mensah and Jimi Hope.

==National music==
The Togolese national anthem is &quot;Salut à toi, pays de nos aïeux&quot; (Land of our forefathers), written by Alex Casimir-Dosseh. From 1979 to 1992 it was replaced by an anthem composed by the party of the Rally of the Togolese People. French is the official and commercial language of Togo.

== Traditional music ==

Togo&#x27;s southern plain is its most populous area, where the capital, Lomé, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea but, like its neighbours, Ghana and Benin, its territory extends hundreds of kilometres northward, passing through a central hill region into the northern savanna that borders Burkina Faso. Its population of over 6 million people, which is 65% rural and agrarian, is composed of about 21 ethnic groups. Approximately 51% of the population has indigenous beliefs, 29% is Christian, and 20% Muslim.

The two most populous language groups are the Ewe in the south (about 32% of the population) and the Kabye in the north (22% of the population). Gen or Mina is the second major language in the south, closely related to Ewe: most southern peoples use these two languages, which are spoken in commercial sectors throughout Togo. Fon, another related language, as well as Aja, are also spoken in the south: the Ewe had entered Togo from the east, and Akan people from the west, several centuries before Europeans arrived.

Folk songs of fishermen in the south may be accompanied by bells such as the gankogui and frikiwa. Folk songs in Ewe and Kabye, are common, Fon and Yoruba songs also occur. Togolese music includes a great variety of percussion-led dance music. All over Togo drums are used, by Christians and Muslims as well, to celebrate all major events of life and for festivals like the Expesoso or &quot;Yeke Yeke&quot; festival. In the Aneho district alone drums in use include the and . There are numerous rhythms in Togo, each area having its own special beat.

In the central hills Tem and the Ghana–Togo Mountain languages are spoken. Dagomba is the second most common language in the north, where other Gur languages such as Mossi and Gourma are also found. The culture of these northern people extends far into Togo&#x27;s neighbouring states, Ghana and Burkina Faso.

<doc id="420838" wikidata="Q3291151" url="?curid=420838" title="Music of Angola">
<text>The music of Angola has been shaped both by wider musical trends and by the political history of the country. while Angolan music has also influenced the music of the other Lusophone countries and Latin American countries. In turn, the music of Angola was instrumental in creating and reinforcing &quot;angolanidade&quot;, the Angolan national identity. The capital and largest city of Angola — Luanda — is home to a diverse group of styles including kazukuta, semba, kizomba and kuduro. Just off the coast of Luanda is Ilha do Cabo, home to an accordion and harmonica-based style of music called rebita.

==Folk music==
===Semba===
Semba is the predecessor to a variety of music styles originating in Africa. Three of the most famous of these are samba, kizomba, and kuduro.

Semba is popular in Angola today as it was long before that country&#x27;s independence from the Portuguese colonial system on November 11, 1975. Various new Semba artists emerge each year in Angola, as they render homage to the veteran semba masters, many of whom are still performing.

Barceló de Carvalho, the Angolan singer popularly known as Bonga, is arguably the most successful Angolan artist to popularize semba music internationally; it is generally being categorized as World music.

==Popular music==
===Colonial times===
Angola&#x27;s popular music has had little international success.

In the 1800s Angolan musicians in the cities experimented with popular styles worldwide, including waltzes and ballads. With the first half of the twentieth century came big bands, who sang in both Portuguese and Kimbundu

Liceu Vieira Dias is considered to be the man who revolutionised Angolan music. Along with his group, Ngola Ritmos, introduced european instruments like the guitar and piano, brought to Angola by the Portuguese, to traditional Angolan rhythms based on percussion and other instruments.

The first group to become known outside of Angola was Duo Ouro Negro, created in 1956. After a successful sting in Portugal, the duo toured Switzerland, France, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. The group that is known as the main pioneer of Angolan music is Ngola Ritmos. Teta Lando, Carlos Lamartine, Waldemar Bastos and Sam Mangwana are a few artists that are considered to be dome of the be popular Angolan artists. Groups like Os Kiezos, Negoleiros do Ritmo, Jovens do Prenda, Ngoma Jazz, Africa Show, Aguias Reais… were some of the main bands of Angola’s music scene during its &quot;Golden Years&quot;.

In the years just before the civil war, the Luanda rock music scene sizzled. One member of a top band said that being in a band then was like being in a top football team; when his band walked into a club, all his supporters would cheer (and rival bands&#x27; groupies would hiss).

Two other prominent musicians of the pre-independence era included David Zé and Urbano de Castro, both of whom were assassinated as a result of their political activism.

During the early 1970s, Bonga became the most well-known Angolan pop musician outside the country. He began performing in the late 1960s when Angolan folk music was starting to become popular. He recorded 1 single in Angola accompanying an artist called Elias dia Kimuewzo, then began travelling between Germany, France and Belgium and recorded all of his music outside of Angola.

===Post-independence===

In the early 1980s, Angolan popular music was deeply influenced by Cuban music. Cuban Rumba was popular and influential across southern Africa, including Angola&#x27;s neighbor Zaïre (renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo), where it became the basis for soukous. 

Two of the most well-known songs from Angola are Humbi Hummbi, an old folkloric song of the Ovimbundu people, along with Muxima, another folkloric song written by Ngola Ritmos.

====Kuduro====
For some time, a new, more electronic music movement, called kuduro, has blossomed in Angola. It combines traditional Angolan Semba with Western house and techno. The main proponent of kuduro is the international group Buraka Som Sistema although there are a number of artists working on the national scene and a growing number of bedroom producers.

====Kizomba====

The most popular genre today is kizomba. Kizomba is a partnered social dance, that is quickly gaining worldwide attention, especially in Europe and North America. Discussions about kizomba employ words such as ‘connected,’ ‘sensual’ and ‘intimate,’ creating dance experiences and a wider scene laden with affect and underlying eroticism. The kizomba rhythm and movement is derived from an up-beat semba, meaning “a touch of the bellies,” which is a characteristic posture of the dance.
Kizomba supports a fairly large number of artists singing in both English and Portuguese. The biggest producer in the Kizomba field is Nelo Paim who works in conjunction with Afonso Quintas and LS Productions. Eduardo Paím, Nelos&#x27;s older brother, has released 10 albums and appeared in concerts worldwide.

<doc id="420839" wikidata="Q10334885" url="?curid=420839" title="Music of Benin">
<text>Benin has played an important role in the African music scene, producing one of the biggest stars to come out of the continent in Angélique Kidjo. Post-independence, the country was home to a vibrant and innovative music scene, where native folk music combined with Ghanaian highlife, French cabaret, American rock, funk and soul, and Congolese rumba. It also has a rich variety of ethnomusicological traditions.

==National music==
The national anthem of Benin, adopted upon independence in 1960, is &quot;L&#x27;Aube Nouvelle&quot; (The New Dawn) by Gilbert Jean Dagnon. The Gangbe brass band is an internationally prominent Beninese ensemble.

==Traditional music==
The majority of Benin’s 9.32 million people live in the south. The population includes about 42 ethnic groups overall. These include coastal populations of Yoruba in the southeast, who migrated from what is now Nigeria in the 12th century, the Fon in the south central area around Abomey, Mina, Xueda and Aja who came from what is now Togo.

Northern peoples include the Dendi in the north-central area, who came from what is now Mali in the 16th century, the Bariba and Fula people in the northeast and the Betammaribe and Somba in the Atacora Range.

==Popular music==

In 1972, the Kérékou government came to power and instituted curfews and other measures that inhibited musical expression. Kérékou encouraged indigenous folk music. Some musicians, like Tohon Stan, adapted folk styles for mainstream audiences at home and abroad, including tchinkoumé, a funeral music played using water percussion which was adapted into tchink-system music.
Sagbohan Danialou, a multi-instrumentalist from Porto Novo, is another very influential musician who transformed traditional Vodou religious rhythms such as kakagbo into popular music.

Ignacio Blazio Osho was perhaps the most influential musician of the post-independence period, alongside Pedro Gnonnas y sus Panchos, Les Volcans and Picoby Band d&#x27;Abomey. Pedro produced the song Feso Jaiye, which became a hit and was performed by many bands at the 2nd All-Africa Games in 1973.

Nel Oliver debuted in France in 1976, borrowing elements from all over Africa and the United States to create &quot;Afro-akpala-funk&quot;.

The “Tout Puissant” Orchestre Poly-Rythmo are still a household name in Cotonou and one of Africa&#x27;s most prolific groups with over 50 LPs, hundreds of 45s and CD re-issues of their work. They have toured both Europe and the United States; according to a concert review in the &quot;New York Times,&quot; the band &quot;belongs on the very short list of the world&#x27;s greatest funk bands.&quot;

Beninese guitarist Lionel Loueke is one of the most important young musicians in jazz, infusing African influences. Loueke currently lives in New York and is a member of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s band.

Wilfrid Houwanou is a Beninese singer-songwriter who goes by the stage name “ROBBI” (formerly Robbi Slo). 

Zeynab Ouloukèmi Habib, born in Abidjan in 1975, has given concerts around Africa and won a Kora Award for Best Female West African Artist in 2005. She released her first album &quot;Intori&quot; in 2001, a second album &quot;D&#x27;un endroit à l&#x27;autre&quot; in 2004, and a third album &quot;Olukèmi&quot; in 2011.

Gangbé Brass Band, from Cotonou continued the trajectory of transforming traditional Vodou music, combining it with jazz and brass band traditions. Gangbe has released four albums: Gangbe (1998), Togbe (2001), Whendo (2004) and Assiko (2008), and tours extensively in Europe and North America.

<text>During World War II, Operation Candytuft was a British raid by 2nd Special Air Service launched on 27 October 1943.

==Description==
Inserted by boat on Italy’s east coast between Ancona and Pescara, the troopers were to destroy railway bridges and disrupt rear areas. The raid was conducted by No. 3 Commando and 6 Demolition Corps under the command of Major Terence Otway. They were dropped as planned at Naine, a small village 10 miles north of the objectives. A fire fight broke out in the village due to the unexpected presence of the 153 grenadiers who were transferred from the Gustav line three days earlier. In order to replenish his supplies Major Ottoway retreated south to Malconi where he and his team were surrounded by the Wehrmacht and later surrendered.

<doc id="420850" wikidata="Q2004845" url="?curid=420850" title="Edmund Fitzalan, 2nd Earl of Arundel">
<text>Edmund Fitzalan, 2nd Earl of Arundel (1 May 1285 – 17 November 1326) was an English nobleman prominent in the conflict between King Edward II and his barons. His father, Richard Fitzalan, 1st Earl of Arundel, died in 1302, while Edmund was still a minor. He, therefore, became a ward of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, and married Warenne&#x27;s granddaughter, Alice. In 1306 he was styled Earl of Arundel, and served under Edward I in the Scottish Wars, for which he was richly rewarded.

After Edward I&#x27;s death, Arundel became part of the opposition to the new king Edward II, and his favourite Piers Gaveston. In 1311 he was one of the so-called Lords Ordainers who assumed control of the government from the king. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, he was responsible for the death of Gaveston in 1312. From this point on, however, his relationship with the king became more friendly. This was to a large extent due to his association with the king&#x27;s new favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, whose daughter was married to Arundel&#x27;s son. Arundel supported the king in suppressing rebellions by Roger Mortimer and other marcher lords, and eventually also Thomas of Lancaster. For this, he was awarded land and offices.

His fortune changed, however, when the country was invaded in 1326 by Mortimer, who had made common cause with the king&#x27;s wife, Queen Isabella. Immediately after the capture of Edward II, the queen, Edward III&#x27;s regent, ordered Arundel executed, his title forfeit and his property confiscated. Arundel&#x27;s son and heir Richard only recovered the title and lands in 1331, after Edward III had taken power from the regency of Isabella and Mortimer. In the 1390s, a cult emerged around the late earl. He was venerated as a martyr, though he was never canonised.

==Family and early life==
Edmund Fitzalan was born in the Castle of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, on 1 May 1285. He was the son of Richard Fitzalan, 1st Earl of Arundel (1267–1302), and his wife, Alice of Saluzzo, daughter of Thomas, marquess of Saluzzo in Italy. Richard had been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result, he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. When Richard died on 9 March 1302, Edmund&#x27;s wardship was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne&#x27;s only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir apparent to the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 he had changed his mind, however, and the two were married.

In April 1306, shortly before turning twenty-one, Edmund was granted possession of his father&#x27;s title and land. On 22 May 1306, he was knighted by Edward I, along with the young Prince Edward (the future Edward II). The knighting was done in expectation of military service during the Scottish Wars, and after the campaign was over, Arundel was richly rewarded. Edward I pardoned the young earl a debt of £4,234. This flow of patronage continued after the death of Edward I in 1307; in 1308 Edward II returned the hundred of Purslow to Arundel, an honour that Edward I had confiscated from Edmund&#x27;s father. There were also official honours in the early years of Edward II&#x27;s reign. At the new king&#x27;s coronation on 25 February 1308, Arundel officiated as chief butler (or &quot;pincerna&quot;), a hereditary office of the earls of Arundel.

==Opposition to Edward II==
Though the reign of Edward II was initially harmonious, he soon met with opposition from several of his earls and prelates. At the source of the discontent was the king&#x27;s relationship with the young Gascon knight Piers Gaveston, who had been exiled by Edward I, but was recalled immediately upon Edward II&#x27;s accession. Edward&#x27;s favouritism towards the upstart Gaveston was an offence to the established nobility, and his elevation to the earldom of Cornwall was particularly offensive. A group of magnates led by Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, forced Gaveston into exile in 1308. By 1309, however, Edward had reconciled himself with the opposition, and Gaveston was allowed to return.

Arundel joined the opposition at an early point, and did not attend the Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston&#x27;s return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II&#x27;s failure to follow up his father&#x27;s Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were to be in charge of the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.

The Ordainers once more sent Gaveston into exile in 1311, but by 1312 he was back. Now the king&#x27;s favourite was officially an outlaw, and Arundel was among the earls who swore to hunt him down. The leader of the opposition—after Lincoln&#x27;s death the year before—was now Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In June 1312 Gaveston was captured, tried before Lancaster, Arundel and the earls of Warwick and Hereford, and executed. A reconciliation was achieved between the king and the offending magnates, and Arundel and the others received pardons, but animosity prevailed. In 1314 Arundel was among the magnates who refused to assist Edward in a campaign against the Scots, contributing to the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn.

==Return to loyalty==
Around the time of Bannockburn, however, Arundel&#x27;s loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward&#x27;s &quot;rapprochement&quot; towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel&#x27;s royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king&#x27;s new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the Elder were gradually taking over control of the government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel&#x27;s situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.
With Arundel&#x27;s change of allegiance came a conflict of interest. In August 1321, a demand was made to the king that Hugh Despenser and his father, Hugh Despenser the Elder, be sent into exile. The king, facing a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, had no choice but to assent. Arundel voted for the expulsion, but later he claimed that he did so under compulsion, and also supported their recall in December. Arundel had suffered personally from the rebellion, when Roger Mortimer seized his castle of Clun. Early in 1322, Arundel joined King Edward in a campaign against the Mortimer family. The opposition soon crumbled, and the king decided to move against Thomas of Lancaster, who had been supporting the marcher rebellion all along. Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March, and executed.

In the aftermath of the rebellion, the Despensers enriched themselves on the forfeited estates of the rebels, and Hugh Despenser the Elder was created Earl of Winchester in May 1322. Also Arundel, who was now one of the king&#x27;s principal supporters, was richly rewarded. After the capture of Roger Mortimer in 1322, he received the forfeited Mortimer lordship of Chirk in Wales. He was also trusted with important offices: he became Chief Justiciar of North and South Wales in 1323, and in 1325 he was made Warden of the Welsh Marches, responsible for the array in Wales. He also extended his influence through marriage alliances; in 1325 he secured marriages between two of his daughters and the sons and heirs of two of Lancaster&#x27;s main allies: the deceased earls of Hereford and Warwick.

==Final years and death==
In 1323, Roger Mortimer, who had been held in captivity in the Tower of London, escaped and fled to France. Two years later, Queen Isabella travelled to Paris on an embassy to the French king. Here, Isabella and Mortimer developed a plan to invade England and replace Edward II on the throne with his son, the young Prince Edward, who was in the company of Isabella. Isabella and Mortimer landed in England on 24 September 1326, and due to the virulent resentment against the Despenser regime, few came to the king&#x27;s aid. Arundel initially escaped the invading force in the company of the king, but was later dispatched to his estates in Shropshire to gather troops. At Shrewsbury he was captured by his old enemy John Charlton of Powys, and brought to Queen Isabella at Hereford. On 17 November—the day after Edward II had been taken captive—Arundel was executed, allegedly on the instigation of Mortimer. According to a chronicle account, the use of a blunt sword was ordered, and the executioner needed 22 strokes to sever the earl&#x27;s head from his body.
Arundel&#x27;s body was initially interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It had been his wish, however, to be buried at the family&#x27;s traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, and this is where he was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the ninth-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may have been inspired by a similar cult around his grandson, Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.

Arundel was attainted at his execution; his estates were forfeited to the crown, and large parts of these were appropriated by Isabella and Mortimer. The castle and honour of Arundel were briefly held by Edward II&#x27;s half-brother Edmund, Earl of Kent, who was executed on 19 March 1330. Edmund Fitzalan&#x27;s son, Richard, failed in an attempted rebellion against the crown in June 1330, and had to flee to France. In October the same year, the guardianship of Isabella and Mortimer was supplanted by the personal rule of King Edward III. This allowed Richard to return and reclaim his inheritance, and on 8 February 1331, he was fully restored to his father&#x27;s lands, and created Earl of Arundel.

==Issue==
Edmund and Alice had at least seven children:
