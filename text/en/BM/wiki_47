<text>The Office Assistant is a discontinued intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character which interfaced with the Office help content. It was included in Microsoft Office, in Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Project, and Microsoft FrontPage. It had a wide selection of characters to choose from, with the most well known being a paperclip called Clippit (commonly referred to by the public as Clippy). The Office Assistant and particularly Clippit have been the subject of numerous criticisms and parodies.

== Description ==
The Office Assistant was an intelligent user interface for Microsoft Office. It assisted users by way of an interactive animated character that interfaced with the Office help content. It was included in Microsoft Office for Windows (versions 97 to 2003), in Microsoft Publisher and Microsoft Project (versions 98 to 2003), Microsoft FrontPage (versions 2002 and 2003), and Microsoft Office for Mac (versions 98 to 2004). The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms.

The default assistant in the English version was named Clippit, after a paperclip. The character was designed by Kevan J. Atteberry. Although the name Clippit was used in all versions of Microsoft Office that supported the Office Assistant feature, the assistant became commonly referred to by the public as Clippy, a name which later occasionally bled into Microsoft marketing materials. Clippit was by far the most notable (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to him being called simply the Microsoft Paperclip.

=== Technology ===
The Office Assistant used technology initially from Microsoft Bob, and later Microsoft Agent, offering advice based on Bayesian algorithms. From Microsoft Office 2000 onward, Microsoft Agent (.acs) replaced the Microsoft Bob-descended Actor (.act) format as the technology supporting the feature. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, Microsoft Agent characters could use the Lernout &amp; Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities, but it required SAPI 4.0. The Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine also allowed Microsoft Agent characters to accept speech input. This technology was also used for the File Explorer&#x27;s search companions in Windows XP.

==History==
According to Alan Cooper, the &quot;Father of Visual Basic&quot;, the concept of Clippit was based on a &quot;tragic misunderstanding&quot; of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer monitors. Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software. As people already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.

Clippit was based on Microsoft Bob, a redesign of early Windows versions. Bob was discontinued in 1996 after receiving poor reception, replaced by Office Assistant shortly after.

First introduced in Microsoft Office 97, the Office Assistant was code-named TFC during development, with the &quot;C&quot; standing for &quot;clown.&quot; It appeared when the program determined the user could be assisted by using Office wizards, searching help, or advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by &quot;Dear&quot; would cause the Assistant to appear with the message, &quot;It looks like you&#x27;re writing a letter. Would you like help?&quot;

Microsoft turned off the feature by default in Office XP, and as a result they focused most of their marketing on that change.

They created the now-defunct website &quot;officeclippy.com&quot;, and hosted three flash cartoons starring a newly unemployed Clippit (now officially being referred to as Clippy,) a song sung by Clippit, and a flash video game called Office XP (Xtract Paperclip) where you use office supplies to try to slay an army of Clippits. On May 31, 2001, during the Office XP launch event in New York City, a man in a Clippit mascot costume interrupts the introduction and gives a speech begging for his job back before being dragged off stage by a comically large magnet. Notably, Clippit is voiced by Gilbert Gottfried during this ad campaign. Later that November, Microsoft published the video game Bicycle Card Games for Windows computers, featuring Clippit as a playable character, with Gilbert Gottfried reprising his role.

On May 11, 2004, Microsoft released Microsoft Office 2003, which would be the last version of Microsoft office to feature the Office Assistant feature, with it being no longer present in all subsequent versions.

==Assistants==
When the Office Assistant feature was introduced in Office 97, the user could choose which character is displayed while they use the program. The list of characters that the user could choose from include:
* Clippit (the anthropomorphic paperclip most are familiar with, the default option in most of the Microsoft Office editions that supported Office Assistant)
* The Dot (a shape-shifting smiley-faced red ball)
* The Genius (a caricature of Albert Einstein, removed in Office XP but available as a downloadable add-on)
* Hoverbot (a robot)
* (a dolphin available for East Asian editions, also downloadable for other regions)
* Office Logo (a jigsaw puzzle composed of four pieces, which was the logo for Microsoft Office 9x. There was also an additional downloadable silent, immobile version of the character with a minor redesign)
* Mother Nature (a globe)
* Power Pup (a superhero dog)
* Scribble (an origami-esque cat)
* Will (a caricature of William Shakespeare)

In Microsoft Office 2000 and beyond, the &quot;Hoverbot&quot;, &quot;Scribble&quot;, &quot;Power Pup&quot;, and &quot;Will&quot; assistants were removed, and new Office Assistants were introduced in their place:
* F1 (a robot who was previously downloadable for Office 97, included in Microsoft Office 2000 &amp; beyond)
* Links (a cat who was previously downloadable for Office 97, included in Microsoft Office 2000 &amp; beyond)
* Rocky (a dog included in Microsoft Office 2000 &amp; beyond)
* Merlin (a wizard inspired by the character of the same name, introduced in Office XP)

The Clippit, Office Logo, and Kairu assistants were also redesigned to have a more three dimensional appearance. The removed assistants later resurfaced as downloadable add-ons along with other additional assistants.

=== Exclusive Assistants ===
In Microsoft Office 98 and 2001, MacOS exclusive editions of Microsoft Office, all of the built in Office 97 assistants were included (also retaining their Office 97 designs) along with an additional three assistants:
* Bosgrove (a butler exclusive to MacOS)
* Earl the cat (a blue cat, also downloadable for Office 97)
* Max (a Macintosh Plus computer exclusive to MacOS)

The Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions:
* (an animated teacher also available for East Asian editions)
* The Monkey King () (based on the fictional character Sun Wukong, also available for East Asian editions)
In 1999, there was a partnership between Microsoft and the Japanese talk show hosted by comedian Sanma Akashiya, where if a customer in Japan were to purchase a copy of Microsoft Office 2000 Upgrade Edition, they would be mailed a promotional CD that would install the show&#x27;s mascot , an alien that resembles a dog as an additional Office Assistant.

==Criticism==
Despite the Office Assistant&#x27;s intention of being helpful, it was widely reviled among users as intrusive and annoying, and was criticized even within Microsoft. Microsoft&#x27;s internal codename TFC had a derogatory origin: Steven Sinofsky states that &quot;C&quot; stood for &quot;clown&quot;, while allowing his readers to guess what &quot;TF&quot; might stand for. &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; called Clippit &quot;one of the worst software design blunders in the annals of computing&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Clippit in a 2010 article listing the fifty worst inventions.

Although helpful to brand-new users, and although introduced at a time when relatively few people had extensive experience with computers, the Office Assistant feature was criticized for interrupting users and not providing advice that was fully adapted to the situation.

== Legacy ==
On January 30, 2007, Microsoft Office 2007 released with the Office Assistant feature being fully removed, and it has remained that way in all subsequent releases of Microsoft Office. Later that same year, Microsoft hosted the TechEd 2007 conference, which featured a keynote opening that parodied Back to the Future. In the opening, then Microsoft president Bob Muglia and Christopher Lloyd (reprising his role as Doc Brown from the movie) use the DeLorean to travel across time, eventually arriving at an alternate future where unsuccessful Microsoft products become a reality. The alternate future is depicted as a white void with a threatening hologram of the smiley face logo from Microsoft Bob alongside a sarcastic Clippit hologram. Interestingly, Gilbert Gottfried does not reprise his role as Clippit this time.

In May of 2009, as way to promote Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft created a website that hosted a trailer for a fake movie titled &quot;Office 2010 - The Movie.&quot; The trailer featured a photograph of Clippit along with his tombstone, referencing the removal of the Office Assistant feature.

On April 2, 2011, Microsoft Office Labs released Ribbon Hero 2: Clippy&#x27;s Second Chance, a free puzzle video game used to teach users the basics of Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010. In the game, Clippit is searching for a part time job before discovering a time machine that takes him to different time periods. The player must complete multiple office related tasks to progress the story further.
A small image of Clippit can be found in Microsoft Office 2013 and newer, which can be seen by going to Options and changing the theme (or Office Background) to &quot;School Supplies&quot;. Clippit would then appear on the ribbon.

Clippit appeared as an Office Assistant in Office Online as part of an April Fools&#x27; Day 2014 joke. Several days later, an easter egg was found in the then-preview version of Windows Phone 8.1. When asked if she likes Clippit, the personal assistant Cortana would answer &quot;Definitely. He taught me how important it is to listen.&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s not to like? That guy took a heck of a beating and he&#x27;s still smiling.&quot; Her avatar occasionally turned into a two-dimensional Metro-style Clippit for several seconds. This easter egg is still available in the full release version of the Windows Phone operating system and Windows 10.

On March 19, 2019, Microsoft released a &quot;Clippy!&quot; sticker pack for Microsoft Teams on the Microsoft 365 Developer GitHub Page, but was later removed three days later. The sticker pack was later integrated into Teams itself on November 1st, 2021, and has been included ever since. He is also present in some of the backgrounds users can select.
On July 2021, Microsoft used Twitter to show off a redesign of Clippit, and said that if it received 20,000 likes they would replace the paperclip emoji on Microsoft 365 with the character. The Tweet quickly surpassed 20,000 likes and they then announced they would replace it. In November 2021, Microsoft officially updated their design of the paperclip emoji (📎) on Windows 11 to be Clippit.

==In popular culture==

Clippit is the subject of numerous humorous parodies and references, including internet memes. It has been lampooned in multiple television series, including &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

=== Parodies ===
There is a Clippit parody in the &quot;Plus! Dancer&quot; application included in Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition which is later included as &quot;Windows Dancer&quot; in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. The dancing character Boo Who? is wearing a ghost outfit, roughly having the shape of Clippit&#x27;s body, with a piece of wire visible underneath. Occasionally, the white sheet slips, and reveals the thin curve of steel. The description mentions &quot;working for a short while for a Redmond, WA based software company, where he continued to work until being retired in 2001&quot;.

Clippit was featured in the music video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Word Crimes.&quot;

Vigor is a Clippit-inspired parody software—a version of the vi text editor featuring a rough-sketched Clippit.

On April 1, 2015, social media website Tumblr created a parody of Clippit, Coppy, as an April Fools joke. Coppy is an anthropomorphized photocopier that behaved in similar ways to Clippit, asking the user if they want help. Coppy would engage the reader in a series of pointless questions, with a dialogue box written in Comic Sans MS, which was deliberately designed to be extremely annoying. In 2022, Tumblr created a Youtooz collectible of Coppy.

Multiple episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; feature a holographic character named &quot;Badgey&quot; who takes the anthropomorphic form of the communication badges featured in the series. The character is initially imbued with characteristics reminiscent of Clippit, but malfunctions and becomes a recurring antagonist.

A hypercasual game for mobile devices and on Windows and macOS via Steam called &quot;Progressbar95&quot; features a spoof of Clippit as a common NPC, often part of annoying popups or carrying sticks of dynamite or guns to hurt the player&#x27;s progress.

=== Other pop culture allusions ===
In a June 2008 episode of the NPR show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; marking the occasion of Bill Gates transitioning to semi-retirement from Microsoft, humorist Adam Felber and comedian Paul Provenza ad-lib a scenario in which Clippit is being driven to a location outside of Redmond, Washington, at night and says such things as &quot;It looks like you&#x27;re digging a grave. Is this a business grave or a personal grave?&quot; The segment has become one of the most requested by listeners for replay during &quot;best of&quot; reviews of the show.

In 2015, a music video directed by Chris Bristow was released for Delta Heavy&#x27;s song &quot;Ghost&quot;, which features a saddened Clippit discovering Shania, a modern voice-activated digital assistant, and later on Clippit becomes angry upon discovering the modern landscape of the world.

In the thirteenth season of the Dungeons and Dragons actual play show Dimension 20 (set in the world of Starstruck), Clippit was used as the basis of a planetary superintelligence called Gnosis in the far future.

In Catherynne M. Valente&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Space Opera&quot;, two humans have been whisked to a distant planet to take part in a music contest that could lead to humanity being destroyed. Soon after arrival, they are disoriented and in great danger, and find themselves confronted by a giant animated Clippit, created by a sentient AI collective based on what it had found was widespread on human computers.

Clippit appears as a mentor non-player character in the artificial-intelligence-based air traffic control system for Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane, SayIntentions.AI.

In the 2021 video game, &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;, Clippit appears as an equippable weapon charm.

<doc id="417935" wikidata="Q215416" url="?curid=417935" title="More (soundtrack)">
<text>More is the third studio album and first soundtrack album by English rock band Pink Floyd. It was released on 13 June 1969 in the United Kingdom by EMI Columbia and on 9 August 1969 in the United States by Tower Records. The soundtrack is for the film of the same name, which was primarily filmed on location on Ibiza and was the directorial debut of Barbet Schroeder. It was the band&#x27;s first album without former leader Syd Barrett.

The album was a top ten hit in the UK, but received mixed reviews. Several songs were performed in Pink Floyd concerts over the following years.

==Background==
Pink Floyd recorded several pieces of film music before this album. In December 1967, they were featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, playing along to a light show, and the following year recorded some instrumental music for the film &quot;The Committee&quot;.

The film &quot;More&quot; featured a young hitchhiker in Ibiza who had succumbed to heroin abuse with party scenes and drug taking. Director Barbet Schroeder was a fan of Pink Floyd, and brought a rough cut of the film to London for them to work with. Instead of typical background music, Schroeder wanted the songs to feature in the film, such as a record playing at a party. The group also speculated they could branch out into a career as film composers if their recording and touring career did not work out. Drummer Nick Mason later said the film was &quot;ideally suited to some of the rumblings, squeaks and sound textures we produced on a regular basis&quot;.

==Recording and songs==
The album was recorded at Pye Studios in London, in late January and early February 1969 with engineer Brian Humphries. The album was the first to be produced by Pink Floyd without assistance from Norman Smith, who retained an executive producer credit, and the first full album without Syd Barrett, who had been ousted from the group in 1968, during the recording of their second album, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;.

Pink Floyd worked out most of the music in two weeks, with material put together quickly and semi-improvised. They did not use a dubbing studio due to budget constraints, and simply timed sequences in the film with a stopwatch so they knew how long the music had to be. Bassist Roger Waters wrote most of the lyrics during breaks between recording backing tracks. Schroeder was impressed by how quickly the group created and recorded the material. Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright co-wrote the instrumental &quot;Up The Khyber&quot;, the only time the pair were credited as sole co-composers. Barrett&#x27;s replacement David Gilmour handled all lead vocals on the album.

&quot;More&quot; features a mixture of styles. Songs such as &quot;Green is the Colour&quot; were acoustic folk ballads, a genre not often explored by the group. Mason&#x27;s wife Lindy played penny whistle on the track. The album also contains hard rock, such as &quot;The Nile Song&quot; and &quot;Ibiza Bar&quot;, as well as several instrumental tracks such as &quot;Quicksilver&quot; and &quot;Main Theme&quot;, featuring their experimental and avant-garde approach. &quot;Cymbaline&quot; criticised the music industry, with lines such as &quot;your manager and agent are both busy on the phone&quot;. The version on the album is different from that in the film. Gilmour sings lead on both versions, though Waters is sometimes wrongly credited as singing lead for the film version.

&quot;Green is the Colour&quot; was played live frequently after release, as a medley with &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot;, as part of a live suite called &quot;The Journey&quot;. It was a regular feature in the set for two years afterwards. &quot;Quicksilver&quot; was played under the title &quot;Sleeping&quot; as part of the 1969 live show called &quot;The Man&quot;, while &quot;Cymbaline&quot; was entitled &quot;Nightmare&quot;. The latter remained part of the group&#x27;s repertoire until the end of 1971. In live performances, the group left the stage partway through the song while the audience listened to a tape of quadraphonic sound effects including footsteps travelling round the venue, and doors opening. &quot;Main Theme&quot; was briefly played live in 1970.

Two songs can be heard in the film which were not included on the album: &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Seabirds&quot;. The latter was published in 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Pink Floyd Songbook&quot;. Both songs, as well as two other songs from those sessions, &quot;Theme (Beat Version)&quot; and &quot;More Blues (Alternative Version)&quot;, were released on the 2016 box set, &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot;. The set in which these tracks appear, &quot;1969: Dramatis/ation&quot; was made available as a standalone release in 2017. The track called &quot;Seabirds&quot; in the box set is not the original song, but an alternative take of &quot;Quicksilver&quot;.

Tracks like &quot;The Crying Song&quot; and &quot;Cymbaline&quot; play on female lead Mimsy Farmer&#x27;s transistor radio as she&#x27;s in her apartment room, and &quot;Ibiza Bar&quot; (as the title implies) plays in the background in a bar. These differ from tracks such as &quot;Up The Khyber&quot; that plays to the action of the film, in which the band are actual composers, or tracks such as &quot;Cirrus Minor&quot; and &quot;Green is the Colour&quot; that play to orchestrate the mood of the scene, and these tracks (and others), unlike &quot;The Crying Song&quot; and &quot;Cymbaline&quot;, are not heard by any of the characters.

==Cover==
The album cover was, like &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, designed by Hipgnosis. It uses a shot from the film of two characters playing around a windmill in Ibiza, processed in a dark room to make it look like a psychedelic trip.

==Release and reception==
&quot;More&quot; reached number 9 in the UK and, upon re-release in 1973, number 153 in the US. This was the last of three Pink Floyd albums to be released in the United States by the Tower Records division of Capitol Records. &quot;The Nile Song&quot; was released as a single in France, Japan and New Zealand around the same time. The track, along with &quot;Cirrus Minor&quot; appeared on the 1971 compilation &quot;Relics&quot;.

A 1973 US reissue was released on Harvest Records. It was certified gold in the US on 11 March 1994. The album was reissued on CD in 1985, with a digitally remastered version following in 1995. In 2016, it was reissued on Pink Floyd Records.

&quot;More&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Record Song Book&quot; said the album was &quot;always extremely interesting ... quite weird in parts too&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was favourable, describing it as starting to &quot;define experimental instrumental identity.&quot; &quot;MusicHound&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; were less positive with the former giving the album a rating of one out of five and the latter calling it a &quot;dull film soundtrack&quot;.

===Legacy===
Richie Unterberger of AllMusic gives a mixed overview, saying key tracks such as &quot;Green Is The Colour&quot; and &quot;Cymbaline&quot; developed into stronger pieces when played live.

<text>The Georgia Electronic Insurance Compliance System or GEICS is a database of all motor vehicles and the current liability insurance carried by their drivers in the U.S. state of Georgia.

It was created by the Georgia General Assembly (the state legislature) during the 2002 session, to cut down the rate of uninsured motorists. Scheduled to go into effect the following January 1, the enforcement of the statute was delayed in early 2003 to 2004 because of significant problems with the database, and the proper collection of the information which insurance companies must report for their Georgia policyholders.

When requested by police, GEICS is now the only valid proof of insurance for Georgia drivers stopped in Georgia. Other states do not have instant access to GEICS however, so paper cards must still be issued. Valid paper cards are also required of those from outside the state while driving in Georgia.

The system was run by the Georgia Department of Motor Vehicle Safety (DMVS), now the Department of Driver Services (DDS), and has over 6.7 million vehicles listed. Of those, over 470,000 (about 7%) were listed as uninsured as of November 2003, a decline from 15% in previous years. In March 2004, the DMVS announced that retroactive to the beginning of the year, it would begin issuing citations by mail, demanding a fine of 25$ from every person who showed as having a lapse in coverage, even for just one day.

<doc id="417941" wikidata="Q274070" url="?curid=417941" title="Alejandro Amenábar">
<text>Alejandro Fernando Amenábar Cantos (born 31 March 1972) is a Chilean-Spanish film director, screenwriter and composer. He has won nine Goya Awards—including Best Director for his 2001 film &quot;The Others&quot;—and two European Film Awards among other honors; he also accepted an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on behalf of Spain for &quot;The Sea Inside&quot;. He has written (or co-written) the screenplays to all seven of his films and composed almost all of their soundtracks.

==Early life==
Amenábar was born in Santiago, Chile, to a Chilean father, Hugo Ricardo Amenábar, and a Spanish mother, Josefina Cantos. He has both Chilean and Spanish citizenship. His father worked as a technician at General Electric, while his mother decided to stay at home and take care of the children. Alejandro is the younger of two brothers; his older brother, Ricardo, was born in 1969.

Josefina&#x27;s older sister had moved to the capital of Chile, Santiago, and she invited Josefina to join her there. In Santiago, Josefina met Hugo. Alejandro was born there in 1972.

In August 1973, his family moved to Spain. The family settled in Madrid, living in a camping caravan. When Alejandro was six years old, they moved to a complex on the outskirts of the town of Paracuellos de Jarama (Madrid).

==Studies==
Alejandro and his brother did not watch much television. From the age of 15, Alejandro would dedicate his time to going to the cinema to watch movies. Other than theater, his passions were writing stories and reading books. According to Alejandro&#x27;s mother, Alejandro had the capacity to absorb everything he read. As a child, he also composed melodies with the keyboard and guitar with the same ease as when he wrote his stories.

Alejandro started his studies at the Padres Escolapios de Getafe school. In his second year of high school, he transferred to the Alameda de Osuna Institute, in the north-east of Madrid. The school was not close to where Alejandro was living; however, his parents, who were very concerned about his education, decided to enroll him in that institute because it was known as one of the best schools in Madrid.

Before he became a director, Alejandro worked as a stock boy in a warehouse and as a gardener, until he had enough money to buy his own home camera. He did not want to start his university studies in cinema before ever having touched a camera. Amenábar entered the Information Sciences Faculty at Madrid&#x27;s Complutense University, where after numerous scholastic failures he decided to give up studying cinema and he began directing. The advantage from having attended university was that he met people who later in life would become very important throughout his career (that was the case for Sergio Rozas and Carlos Montero, through whom he met Eduardo Noriega). At university, he also met Mateo Gil, a friend and companion, and the pair made a pact to always support each other&#x27;s projects.

==Film career==
Between 1991 and 1994, Amenábar made three short films which in a very significant way influenced his first full-length films: &quot;La Cabeza&quot;, &quot;Himenóptero&quot;, and &quot;Luna&quot;.

Knowing José Luis Cuerda helped Alejandro greatly in his career. A friend of José Luis Cuerda gave him the script of &quot;Himenóptero&quot; so he would give his opinion. Thereafter, Cuerda was interested in Amenábar&#x27;s work. This led to him becoming the producer of &quot;Thesis&quot; (1996), which is one of Amenábar&#x27;s most recognized films, putting his name on the map. &quot;Thesis&quot; was a thriller set in the School of Information Sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid. Through this film, he gained the attention of critics in the Berlin Film Festival and won seven Goyas, including Best Picture and Best New Director.

In 1997 he made &quot;Abre Los Ojos&quot;, a science fiction movie that had notable success at international festivals such as Berlin and Tokyo. Impressed by the movie, Tom Cruise bought the rights to adapt and produce the film, starring in a remake, &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;.

His third full length film was &quot;The Others&quot;, a ghost story starring Nicole Kidman. It was very successful at an international level, especially in Spain, where it was the most viewed film that year. &quot;The Others&quot; was also very popular in the United States, where it was at the top of the box office for several weeks. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2001, won eight Goyas, including the Best Picture and Best Director, and was nominated for best European Film Movie.

In 2004 Amenábar released &quot;The Sea Inside&quot;, a real life-story about a quadriplegic Ramón Sampedro (played by Javier Bardem), which addressed issues such as euthanasia, abortion, or “the right to a dignified life.” The movie won 14 Goyas, including best movie and best director, and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004.

In 2008 Amenábar released his next film, called &quot;Mists of Time&quot;; however he later changed the name to &quot;Agora&quot;. The film starred big-name actors including Rachel Weisz and Max Minghella. Agora premiered on October 9, 2009, and with a budget of 50 million euros, it is the most expensive Spanish film in history.

After a hiatus of almost seven years, Amenábar returned in 2015 with the thriller &quot;Regression&quot;, starring Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson. The film had its world premiere at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in September 2015, where reviews were lukewarm.

Amenábar is also the composer of the soundtrack of his films, as well as others, such as &quot;Butterfly&#x27;s Tongue&quot; directed by José Luis Cuerda and &quot;Nobody Knows Anybody&quot; directed by Mateo Gil.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Amenábar came out as gay. On 18 July 2015, he married David Blanco. Their divorce was finalised in 2019. Amenábar was raised Catholic, but later became agnostic and is now atheist.

<text>Justin Guarini (born Justin Eldrin Bell; October 28, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter and actor who in 2002 was the runner-up on the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

== Early life ==
Guarini was born in Columbus, Georgia. His father, Eldrin Bell, is African-American and is the former Chief of Police of Atlanta, and former chairperson of the Clayton County Commission in Clayton County, Georgia. His mother, Kathy Pepino Guarini, is Italian American, and was a journalist for WTVM TV in Columbus, and later for CNN. Guarini was primarily raised by his mother and stepfather, physicist Jerry Guarini, in the Philadelphia suburb of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He attended Central Bucks High School East.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings ===
Guarini&#x27;s musical experience started at age four when he was accepted by the Atlanta Boy Choir. After moving to Pennsylvania in 1985, he joined the Archdiocese of Philadelphia Boys Choir. Throughout his school years Guarini sang in school choirs, and from 1996 to 2000 was the lead soloist in an award-winning a cappella group named The Midnight Voices. The group released an independent album in 1999 with proceeds benefiting a music scholarship fund at Guarini&#x27;s alma mater, Central Bucks High School East in Buckingham, Pennsylvania. He was a director/performer at the Riverside Haunted Woods in Bridgeton Township, Pennsylvania, in 2001.

His high school and college theatre credits include the lead roles in &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, and &quot;Once on This Island&quot;. In addition to singing and stage performing, Guarini plays the piano, guitar, and banjo.

After studying vocal performance and theater studies at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Guarini later moved to New York City, where he attended the School for Film and Television. He worked in New York nightclubs, and auditioned for New York Theatre before successfully auditioning for &quot;American Idol&quot; in April 2002. Shortly after being chosen for &quot;American Idol&quot;, he was offered a role in the Broadway production of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Guarini wrote about his decision between the two offers in his exclusive 2008 blog for the television site, Fancast, stating, &quot;I had attended master classes… I learned Zulu and Sotho phrases, as well as the music from the show. It was a dream almost come true at the time. But, now I knew I was onto something, and I wasn&#x27;t letting go. I politely declined the offer of a role...&quot;. He was also considering a contract offer from an independent record label, but the show&#x27;s rules prohibited participants from having existing record contracts.

=== &quot;American Idol&quot; ===
&quot;Idol&quot; judge Simon Cowell praised Guarini&#x27;s performance in the show&#x27;s first season, at one early audition telling him &quot;Justin, you know, occasionally you&#x27;re very privileged when you do a competition like this to hear somebody undiscovered who has a voice like yours&quot;, with Guarini ultimately becoming the runner-up to winner Kelly Clarkson in September 2002. Soon after, Guarini signed with &quot;American Idol&#x27;s&quot; 19 Management and secured a record deal with RCA. Prior to the American Idol Tour, he was the only contestant asked to appear on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, on which Oprah Winfrey told him, &quot;Justin, you have &quot;it&quot;.&quot;

==== &quot;American Idol&quot; performances ====
=== 2003–2004: &quot;Justin Guarini&quot; ===

His eponymous album debuted in June 2003, coinciding with the single releases of the current second season &quot;American Idol&quot; top two finalists and the movie &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;, in which Guarini co-starred with Kelly Clarkson. The film was critically panned, while the album sold 146,000 copies. In December 2003 Guarini was dropped from RCA Records.

Guarini had a role in the 2004 pre-Broadway New York Stage and Film Powerhouse Theater workshop/presentation of the musical &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; at Vassar College. His performance (which included singing, dancing, acting, and playing guitar) landed Guarini an offer to continue the role in the original Broadway production, which he eventually declined.

=== 2005–2007: &quot;Stranger Things Have Happened&quot; ===
Guarini co-produced his second album &quot;Stranger Things Have Happened&quot;, independently released in December 2005 through his own production company, Justice Entertainment, Ltd.. The album of reinvented jazz standards was described by Allmusic as &quot;a successful reinvention... where his natural skills shine&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said that &quot;Guarini displays an agile, attractive voice with good phrasing, supported by a sophisticated and funky backing ensemble.&quot;

Guarini wrote, co-arranged and recorded a benefit song released with H.H. Gayuna Cealo, and a song for the documentary series &quot;Project Everlasting,&quot; in August 2006 and featured on the &quot;Today Show.&quot; The title track from his album &quot;Stranger Things Have Happened&quot; was also used in the documentary.

From 2007 to 2011, TV Guide Network signed Guarini as permanent co-host for &quot;Idol Wrap&quot; and &quot;Idol Tonight&quot;. On-air duties with the network expanded to include guest hosting/appearances on other TV Guide Network shows, hosting movie premiere specials, and serving as a member of TV Guide Network&#x27;s awards show team with on-air coverage of awards shows such as the Grammy Awards and Emmy Awards.

=== 2008–2009: &quot;Revolve&quot; ===

In May 2008, Guarini released an acoustic EP titled &quot;Revolve&quot; comprising three songs (&quot;Sweet Time&quot;, &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, and &quot;When She Cries&quot;) co-written and co-produced with Shaun Ingram.

While stepping out to support the opening of &quot;The American Idol Experience&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in February 2009, Guarini confirmed his impending marriage to his fiancée, Reina Capodici. In an exclusive pictorial of the wedding, &quot;People&quot; reported that the couple married on September 26, 2009.

Guarini became a part of the Broadway community with his 2010 Broadway debut as Carlos in a musical adaptation of Pedro Almodovar&#x27;s film &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.&quot; Critics called Guarini&#x27;s debut &quot;surprisingly charming&quot;, &quot;captivating&quot; and &quot;extremely likeable&quot;.

Guarini played Will, one of the three male leads in Green Day&#x27;s rock musical &quot;American Idiot&quot; performing March 1, 2011, through the show&#x27;s closing night, April 24, 2011.

Also in 2016, Guarini was cast in Broadway&#x27;s new &quot;In Transit&quot;, the first a cappella musical with book, music and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez, James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan, and Sara Wordsworth.

He was an executive producer for the 2015 revival of the musical &quot;Side Show.&quot;

In 2016, Guarini attended the Tony Awards, and co-hosted backstage coverage of the live broadcast in conjunction with BroadwayHD.com.

<text>Middle Claydon is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about south of Buckingham and about west of Winslow. Administratively, the parish is within the remit of Buckinghamshire Council, the unitary authority for most of the county.

The toponym &quot;Claydon&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;clay hill&quot;. The affix &quot;Middle&quot; differentiates the village from nearby Steeple Claydon, and East Claydon, and from the hamlet of Botolph Claydon. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the Claydon area as &quot;Claindone&quot;.

The Church of England parish church of All Saints is in the grounds of Claydon House, a National Trust property. The house was the home of Sir Edmund Verney, an English Civil War Royalist, and of Florence Nightingale.

<doc id="417945" wikidata="Q746607" url="?curid=417945" title="Greater Serbia">
<text>The term Greater Serbia or Great Serbia () describes the Serbian nationalist and irredentist ideology of the creation of a Serb state which would incorporate all regions of traditional significance to Serbs, a South Slavic ethnic group, including regions outside modern-day Serbia that are partly populated by Serbs. The initial movement&#x27;s main ideology (Pan-Serbism) was to unite all Serbs (or all territory historically ruled, seen to be populated by, or perceived to be belonging to Serbs) into one state, claiming, depending on the version, different areas of many surrounding countries, regardless of non-Serb populations present.

The Greater Serbian ideology includes claims to various territories aside from modern-day Serbia, including the whole of the former Yugoslavia except Slovenia and part of Croatia. According to Jozo Tomasevich, in some historical forms, Greater Serbian aspirations also included parts of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Its inspiration comes from the medieval Serbian Empire which existed briefly in 14th-century Southeast Europe from 1346 to 1371, prior to the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Some territories intended to be incorporated in the Greater Serbia exceeded the boundaries of the Serbian Empire, however.

==Historical perspective==


Following the growing nationalistic tendency in Europe from the 18th century onwards, such as the Unification of Italy, Serbia – after first gaining its principality within the Ottoman Empire in 1817 – experienced a popular desire for full unification with the Serbs of the remaining territories, mainly those living in neighbouring entities.

The idea of territorial expansion of Serbia was formulated in 1844 in Načertanije, a secret political draft of the Principality of Serbia made by Ilija Garašanin, a conservative statesman with Bismarckian aspirations. According to the draft, the new Serbian state could include the neighboring areas of Montenegro, Northern Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the early 20th century, all political parties of the Kingdom of Serbia (except for the Social Democratic Party) were planning to create a Balkan Federation, generally accepted the idea of uniting all Serbs into one only Serbian state which would be a part of the Balkan federation. From the creation of the Principality until the First World War, the territory of Serbia was constantly expanding.

After the end of the Balkan Wars, the Kingdom of Serbia achieved the expansion towards the south, but there was a mixed reaction to the events, for the reason that the promises of lands gaining access to the Adriatic Sea were not fulfilled. Instead, Serbia received the territories of Vardar Macedonia that was intended to become part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Serbian Army had to leave those coastal territories that would become part of the newly formed Principality of Albania. This event, together with the Austro-Hungarian Annexation of Bosnia, frustrated Serbian aspirations, since there was still a large number of Serbs remaining out of the Kingdom.

The Serbian victory in the First World War was supposed to serve as compensation to this situation and there was an open debate between the followers of the Greater Serbia doctrine, that defended the incorporation of the parts of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire where Serbs lived to Serbia, opposed by the ones that supported an idea of uniting not only all the Serbian lands, but also to include other South Slav nations into a new country. 

The Serbian Royal family of Karađorđević was set to rule this new state, called Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, that would be renamed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. Initially, the proponents of the Greater Serbia doctrine felt satisfied, since the main goal of uniting all Serbian-inhabited lands under the rule of a Serbian Monarchic dynasty was mostly achieved. During the inter-war period, the majority of Serbian politicians defended a strong centralised country, while their opponents demanded major autonomy for the regions.

Following the German-led invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, these tensions grew to become one of the most brutal civil wars that occurred in World War II. The Royal Government soon capitulated and fled to exile in London. Resistance was initially made by the Chetniks, who defended the restoration of the Monarchy but would eventually collaborate with the Axis powers with the goal of forming a post-war Greater Serbia, and the Partisans, a multi-ethnic antifascist movement who waged a guerrilla campaign against occupying forces and supported the transformation of Yugoslavia into a socialist federal republic. The Serbs were largely divided into these two factions with differing ideologies and goals, leading to internal fighting. Others found themselves in the collaborationist factions of Milan Nedić and Dimitrije Ljotić such as the Serbian Volunteer Corps. Beside this, other Yugoslav non-Serb nationalists took advantage of the situation and allied themselves with the Axis countries, regarding this moment as their historical opportunity of fulfilling their own irredentist aspirations. Another portion of non-Serbs also fought under the Partisan movement towards a united communist-led Yugoslavia.

After the war, victorious Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito became the head of state of Yugoslavia until his death in 1980. During this period the country was divided in six republics. In 1976, within the Socialist Republic of Serbia two autonomous provinces, SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina, were created. During this period, most of the Greater Serbian ideology followers were incarcerated as accused of betrayal, or exiled. Within the rest of the Serbian population, the vast majority became strong supporters of this new Non-Aligned Yugoslavia.

==History==

===Obradović&#x27;s Pan-Serbism===

The first person to formulate the modern idea of Pan-Serbism was Dositej Obradović (1739–1811), a writer and thinker who dedicated his writings to the &quot;Slavoserbian people&quot;, which he described as &quot;the inhabitants of Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Croatia, Syrmium, Banat, and Bačka&quot;, and who he regarded as all his &quot;Serbian brethren, regardless of their church and religion&quot;. Other proponents of Pan-Serbism included historian Jovan Rajić and politician and lawyer Sava Tekelija, both of whom published works incorporating many of the aforementioned areas under a single umbrella name of &quot;Serbian lands&quot;.
The concept of Pan-Serbism espoused by these three was not an imperialist one, based upon the notion of Serbian conquest, but a rationalist one. They all believed that rationalism would overcome the barriers of religion that separated the Slavs into Orthodox Christians, Catholics, and Muslims, uniting the peoples as one nation. The idea of a unification and homogenization by force was propounded by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš (1813–1851).

===Garašanin&#x27;s Načertanije===

Some authors claim that the roots of the Greater Serbian ideology can be traced back to Serbian minister Ilija Garašanin&#x27;s &quot;Načertanije&quot; (1844). &quot;Načertanije&quot; (Начертаније) was influenced by &quot;&quot;Conseils sur la conduite a suivre par la Serbie&quot;, a document written by Polish Prince Adam Czartoryski in 1843 and the revised version by Polish ambassador to Serbia, Franjo Zach, &quot;Zach&#x27;s Plan&quot;&quot;.

The work claimed lands that were inhabited by Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Montenegrins, Bosnians, Hungarians and Croats as part of Greater Serbia. Garašanin&#x27;s plan also included methods of spreading Serbian influence in the claimed lands. He proposed ways to influence Croats and Slavic Muslims, who Garašanin regarded as &quot;Serbs of Catholic faith&quot; and &quot;Serbs of Islamic faith&quot;. The document also emphasized the necessity of cooperation between the Balkan nations and it advocated that the Balkans should be governed by the nations from the Balkans.

This plan was kept secret until 1906 and has been interpreted by some as a blueprint for Serbian national unification, with the primary concern of strengthening Serbia&#x27;s position by inculcating Serbian and pro-Serbian national ideology in all surrounding peoples that are considered to be devoid of national consciousness. Because &quot;Načertanije&quot; was a secret document until 1906, it could not have affected national consciousness at the popular level. However, some scholars suggest that from the second half of the nineteenth century to the outbreak of World War I, “leading political groups and social strata in Serbia were thoroughly imbued with the ideas in the Nacertanije and differed only in intensity of feeling and political conceptualization”. Political insecurity, more so than Yugoslavism or Serbian nationalism, appeared to be the prevailing reasoning behind the idea of expanding Serbian borders. The document is one of the most contested of nineteenth-century Serbian history, with rival interpretations. Some scholars argue that Garašanin was an inclusive Yugoslavist, while others maintain that he was an exclusive Serbian nationalist seeking a Greater Serbia.

===Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s Pan-Serbism===

The most notable Serbian linguist of the 19th century, Vuk Karadžić, was a follower of the view that all south Slavs that speak the Shtokavian dialect (of Serbo-Croatian) were Serbs, speaking the Serbian language. As this definition implied that large areas of continental Croatia, Dalmatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, including areas inhabited by Roman Catholics – Vuk Karadžić is considered by some to be the progenitor of the Greater Serbia program. More precisely, Karadžić was the shaper of modern secular Serbian national consciousness, with the goal of incorporating all indigenous Shtokavian speakers (Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim) into one, modern Serbian nation. German historian Michael Weithmann considers that Karadžić expressed dangerous ideological and political idea in scientific shape i.e. that all southern Slavs are Serbs while Czech historian Jan Rychlik consider that Karadžić became a propagator of greater Serbian ideology and uttered a theory according to which all Yugoslav people speaking the shtokavian dialect are Serbs.


This view is not shared by Andrew Baruch Wachtel (&quot;Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation&quot;) who sees him as a partisan of South Slav unity, albeit in a limited sense, in that his linguistic definition emphasized what united South Slavs rather than the religious differences that had earlier divided them. However, one might argue that such a definition is very partisan: Karadžić himself eloquently and explicitly professed that his aim was to unite all native Shtokavian speakers whom he identified as &quot;Serbs&quot;. Therefore, Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s central linguistic-political aim was the growth of the realm of Serbdom according to his ethnic-linguistic ideas and not a unity of any sort between Serbs and the other nations. A clerical support to Greater Serbian ideology, and Karadžić&#x27;s idea, was provided by Nikodim Milaš in his writings of &quot;Pravoslavna Dalmacija&quot; (1901).

===Balkan Wars===
The idea of reclaiming historic Serbian territory has been put into action several times during the 19th and 20th centuries, notably in Serbia&#x27;s southward expansion in the Balkan Wars. Serbia claimed &quot;historical rights&quot; to the possession of Macedonia, acquired by Stephen Dušan in fourteenth century.

Serbia gained significant territorial expansion in the Balkan Wars and almost doubled its territory, with the areas populated mostly by non-Serbs (Albanians, Bulgarians, Turks and others). Serbia&#x27;s most important goal of the Balkan Wars was access to the open sea. so the Kingdom of Serbia occupied most of the interior of Albania and Albania&#x27;s Adriatic coast. A series of massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars were committed by the Serbian and Montenegrin Army. According to the Report of the International Commission on the Balkan Wars, Serbia consider annexed territories &quot;as a dependency, a sort of conquered colony, which these conquerors might administer at their good pleasure&quot;. Newly acquired territories were subjected to military government, and were not included in Serbia&#x27;s constitutional system. The opposition press demanded the rule of law for the population of the annexed territories and the extension of the constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia to these regions.

The Royal Serbian Army captured Durazzo () on 29 November 1912 without any resistance. Orthodox Christian metropolitan of Durrës Jakob gave a particularly warm welcome to the new authorities. Due to Jakob&#x27;s intervention to the Serbian authorities several Albanian guerrilla units were saved and avoided execution.

However, the army of the Kingdom of Serbia retreated from Durrës in April 1913 under pressure of the naval fleet of Great Powers, but it remained in other parts of Albania for the next two months.

===Black Hand===
The secret military society called Unity or Death, popularly known as the Black Hand, headed by Serbian colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis, which took an active and militant stance on the issue of a Greater Serbian state. This organization is believed to have been responsible for numerous atrocities following the Balkan Wars in 1913.

===World War I and the creation of Yugoslavia===

By 1914 the Greater Serbian concept was eventually replaced by the Yugoslav Pan-Slavic movement. The change in approach was meant as a means to gain support of other Slavs which neighboured Serbs who were also occupied by Austria-Hungary. The intention to create a south Slav or &quot;Yugoslav&quot; state was expressed in the Niš declaration by Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić in 1914, as well as in Serbia&#x27;s regent Alexander&#x27;s statement in 1916. The documents showed that Serbia would pursue a policy that would integrate all territory that contained Serbs and southern Slavs (except Bulgarians), including Croats and Slovenes.

The Treaty of London (1915) of the allies would assign to Serbia the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Srem, Bačka, Slavonia (against Italian objections) and northern Albania (to be divided with Montenegro).

After the First World War, Serbia achieved a maximalist nationalist aspirations with the unification of the south Slavic regions of Austria-Hungary and Montenegro, into a Serbian-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

During the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the government of the Kingdom pursued a linguistic Serbisation policy towards the Macedonians in Macedonia, then called &quot;Southern Serbia&quot; (unofficially) or &quot;Vardar Banovina&quot; (officially). The dialects spoken in this region were referred to as dialects of Serbo-Croatian.
Either way, those southern dialects were suppressed with regards education, military and other national activities, and their usage was punishable.

===World War II and Moljević&#x27;s Homogenous Serbia===

During World War II, the Serbian royalist Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland which was headed by General Draža Mihailović attempted to define its vision of a postwar future. One of its intellectuals was the Bosnian Serb nationalist Stevan Moljević who, in 1941, proposed in a paper which was titled &quot;Homogenous Serbia&quot; that an even larger Greater Serbia should be created, incorporating not only Bosnia and much of Croatia but also chunks of Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and Hungary in areas where Serbs don&#x27;t represent a significant minority. In the territories which were under their military control, the Chetniks waged ethnic cleansing in a genocidal campaign against ethnic Croats and Bosnian Muslims.

It was a point of discussion at a Chetnik congress which was held in the village of Ba in central Serbia in January 1944; however, Moljević&#x27;s ideas were never put into practice due to the Chetniks&#x27; defeat by Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans (initially a movement predominantly composed of Serbs which became more multi-ethnic by this time) and it is difficult to assess how influential they were, due to the lack of records from the Ba congress. Nonetheless, Moljević&#x27;s core idea—that Serbia is defined by the pattern of Serb settlement, irrespective of existing national borders—was to remain an underlying theme of the Greater Serbian ideal.

==Role in the dissolution of Yugoslavia==

===SANU Memorandum===

Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (1986) was the single most important document to set into motion the pan-Serbian movement of the late 1980s which led to Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s rise to power and the subsequent Yugoslav wars. The authors of the Memorandum included the most influential Serbian intellectuals, among them: Dobrica Ćosić, Pavle Ivić, Antonije Isaković, Dušan Kanazir, Mihailo Marković, Miloš Macura, Dejan Medaković, Miroslav Pantić, Nikola Pantić, Ljubiša Rakić, Radovan Samardžić, Miomir Vukobratović, Vasilije Krestić, Ivan Maksimović, Kosta Mihailović, Stojan Čelić and Nikola Čobelić. Philosopher Christopher Bennett characterized the memorandum as &quot;an elaborate, if crude, conspiracy theory.&quot; The memorandum claimed systematic discrimination against Serbs and Serbia culminating with the allegation that the Serbs of Kosovo and Metohija were being subjected to genocide. According to Bennett, despite most of these claims being obviously absurd, the memorandum was merely one of several similar polemics published at the time.

The Memorandum&#x27;s defenders claim that far from calling for a breakup of Yugoslavia on Greater Serbian lines, the document was in favor of Yugoslavia. Its support for Yugoslavia was however conditional on fundamental changes to end what the Memorandum argued was the discrimination against Serbia which was inbuilt into the Yugoslav constitution. The chief of these changes was abolition of the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to Norman Cigar, because the changes were unlikely to be accepted passively, the implementation of the Memorandum&#x27;s program would only be possible by force.

===Milošević&#x27;s rise to power===
With the rise to power of Milošević the Memorandum&#x27;s discourse became mainstream in Serbia. According to Bennett, Milošević used a rigid control of the media to organize a propaganda campaign in which the Serbs were the victims and stressed the need to readjust Yugoslavia due to the alleged bias against Serbia. This was then followed by Milošević&#x27;s anti-bureaucratic revolution in which the provincial governments of Vojvodina and Kosovo and the Republican government of Montenegro, were overthrown giving Milošević the dominating position of four votes out of eight in Yugoslavia&#x27;s collective presidency. Milošević had achieved such a dominant position for Serbia because, according to Bennett, the old communist authorities had failed to stand up to him. During August 1988, supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were reported to have shouted Greater Serbia themed chants of &quot;Montenegro is Serbia!&quot;

Croatia and Slovenia denounced the demands by Milošević for a more centralized system of government in Yugoslavia and they began to demand that Yugoslavia be made a full multi-party confederal state. Milošević claimed that he opposed a confederal system but also declared that should a confederal system be created, the external borders of Serbia would be an &quot;open question&quot;, insinuating that his government would pursue creating a Greater Serbia if Yugoslavia was decentralized. Milosevic stated: &quot;These are the questions of borders, essential state questions. The borders, as you know, are always dictated by the strong, never by weak ones.&quot;
By this point several opposition parties in Serbia were openly calling for a Greater Serbia, rejecting the then existing boundaries of the Republics as the artificial creation of Tito&#x27;s partisans. These included Šešelj&#x27;s Serbian Radical Party, claiming that the recent changes had rectified most of the anti-Serb bias that the Memorandum had alleged. Milošević supported the groups calling for a Greater Serbia, insisting on the demand for &quot;all Serbs in one state&quot;. The Socialist Party of Serbia appeared to be defenders of the Serb people in Yugoslavia. Serbian president Slobodan Milošević, who was also the leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly stated that all Serbs should enjoy the right to be included in Serbia. Opponents and critics of Milošević claimed that &quot;Yugoslavia could be that one state but the threat was that, should Yugoslavia break up, then Serbia under Milošević would carve out a Greater Serbia&quot;.

Major changes took place in Yugoslavia in 1990 when free elections brought opposition parties to power in Croatia and Slovenia. In 1990, power had seeped away from the federal government to the republics and were deadlocked over the future of Yugoslavia with the Slovene and Croatian republics seeking a confederacy and Serbia a stronger federation. Gow states, &quot;it was the behavior of Serbia that added to the Croatian and Slovene Republic&#x27;s belief that no accommodation was possible with the Serbian Republic&#x27;s leadership&quot;. The last straw was on 15 May 1991 when the outgoing Serb president of the collective presidency along with the Serb satellites on the presidency blocked the succession of the Croatian representative Stjepan Mesić as president. According to Gow, from this point on Yugoslavia &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;ceased to function&quot;.

===Virovitica–Karlovac–Karlobag line===
The Virovitica–Karlovac–Karlobag line ( / &quot;Virovitica–Karlovac–Karlobag linija&quot;) is a hypothetical boundary that describes the western extent of an irredentist nationalist Serbian state. It defines everything east of this line, Karlobag–Ogulin–Karlovac–Virovitica, as a part of Serbia, while the west of it would be within Slovenia, and all which might remain of Croatia. Such a boundary would give the majority of the territory of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the Serbs.

This line was frequently referenced by Serbian politician Vojislav Šešelj.

A greater Serbian state was supported for irredentist as well as economical reasons, as it would give Serbia a large coastline, heavy industries, agricultural farmland, natural resources and all of the crude oil (mostly found in the Pannonian Plain, and particularly in the Socialist Republic of Croatia). There were various Serbian politicians associated with Slobodan Milošević in the early 1990s who publicly espoused such views: Mihalj Kertes, Milan Babić, Milan Martić, Vojislav Šešelj, Stevan Mirković.

In his speeches and books, Šešelj claimed that all of the population of these areas are in fact ethnic Serbs, of Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Muslim faith. However, outside of Šešelj&#x27;s Serbian Radical Party, the line as such was never promoted in recent Serbian political life.

===Yugoslav wars===


The war crimes charges against Milošević are based on the allegation that he sought the establishment of a &quot;Greater Serbia&quot;. Prosecutors at the Hague argued that &quot;the indictments were all part of a common scheme, strategy or plan on the part of the accused [Milošević] to create a &#x27;Greater Serbia&#x27;, a centralized Serbian state encompassing the Serb-populated areas of Croatia and Bosnia and all of Kosovo, and that this plan was to be achieved by forcibly removing non-Serbs from large geographical areas through the commission of the crimes charged in the indictments. Although the events in Kosovo were separated from those in Croatia and Bosnia by more than three years, they were no more than a continuation of that plan, and they could only be understood completely by reference to what had happened in Croatia and Bosnia.&quot;

The Hague Trial Chamber found that the strategic plan of the Bosnian Serb leadership consisted of &quot;a plan to link Serb-populated areas in BiH together, to gain control over these areas and to create a separate Bosnian Serb state, from which most non-Serbs would be permanently removed&quot;. It also found that media in certain areas focused only on Serb Democratic Party policy and reports from Belgrade became more prominent, including the presentation of extremist views and promotion of the concept of a Greater Serbia, just as in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina the concept of a Greater Croatia was openly advocated.

Vuk Drašković, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, called for the creation of a Greater Serbia which would include Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, Macedonia and Montenegro, as well as regions within Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia with high concentrations of Serbs. About 160,000 Croats were expelled from territories Serbian forces sought to control.

Much of the fighting in the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s was the result of an attempt to keep Serbs unified. Mihailo Marković, the Vice President of the Main Committee of Serbia&#x27;s Socialist Party, rejected any solution that would make Serbs outside Serbia a minority. He proposed establishing a federation consisting of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbs residing in the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina, Slavonia, Baranja, and Srem.

===Later developments ===

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) accused Slobodan Milošević and other Serb leaders of committing crimes against humanity which included murder, forcible population transfer, deportation and &quot;persecution on political, racial or religious grounds.&quot; Tribunal prosecutor&#x27;s office has accused Milosevic of &quot;the gravest violations of human rights in Europe since the Second World War and genocide.&quot;

Serbian historian Sima Ćirković stated that grumblings about Greater Serbia and pointing fingers at Garašanin&#x27;s Načertanije and the &quot;Memorandum&quot; is not helping to solve the existing problems and that it is an abuse of history.

Serbian academic Čedomir Popov considers that the allegations of &quot;Greater Serbian intentions&quot; are often used for politically anti-Serbian interests and that they are factually incorrect. Popov stated that throughout the Serbian history there never was nor ever will be a Greater Serbia.

In 2008, Aleksandar Vučić, a former member of the Serbian Radical Party, which advocated the creation of a Greater Serbia, stated that Šešelj&#x27;s vision of Greater Serbian was unrealistic and that idea of Greater Serbia was unrealistic at the moment because of balance of power held by the great powers.

==Recent events==

In 2011, there was a movement calling for the unification of Republika Srpska with Serbia.
This idea is detested by Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina where it is seen as an act of breaking the Dayton Agreement, while Serbs see it as an example of self-determination.

The 2021 Balkan non-papers, were two documents of unknown origin, with several sources claiming that they had been drafted by the government of Slovenia. The first non-paper called for the &quot;peaceful dissolution&quot; of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the annexation of Republika Srpska and great parts of Herzegovina and Central Bosnia into a Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia, leaving a small Bosniak state in what is central and western Bosnia.
=== Serbian world ===
Ever since 2020, a new term called &quot;Serbian world&quot; () came to use among prominent Serbian politicians such as Aleksandar Vulin. In November 2024, while speaking in Banja Luka, Vulin as a deputy prime minister of Serbia said that &quot;process of creation of Serbian world, process of unification, had begun&quot;. Several regional media outlets and political commentators interpreted this term as a replacement for the earlier concept of &quot;Greater Serbia&quot;. On June 8, 2024, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić hosted the Pan-Serb Assembly in Belgrade, bringing together representatives of Serbs from across the former Yugoslavia. According to political scientist Alexander Rhotert, who quotes Vulin, the main objective of the assembly was to execute the strategic goal of Serbian world, which is creation of &quot;political and state territory&quot; on which all Serbs would live and which would be a somewhat smaller version of Greater Serbia. The assembly produced General Serb Declaration; the document asserts that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia, and Republika Srpska is being considered a &quot;national interest of Serbia&quot;. Prime minister of Serbia Miloš Vučević in December 2024 stated that one of the projects related to aforementioned General Serb Declaration is a construction of Trebinje airport in Eastern Herzegovina.

<doc id="417946" wikidata="Q2614140" url="?curid=417946" title="Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo">
<text>Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo, (; ; 21 February 1822 – 8 February 1872) styled Lord Naas (; ) from 1842 to 1867 and Lord Mayo in India, was a prominent British statesman and Conservative politician. He served as Chief Secretary for Ireland (1852, 1858–9, 1866–8) and was Viceroy of India from 1869 until his assassination in 1872.

==Background and education==
Mayo was born in Dublin, Ireland, the eldest son of Robert Bourke, 5th Earl of Mayo (the son of Hon. Richard Burke, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore), and his wife, Anne Charlotte, daughter of the Hon. John Jocelyn. His younger brother the Hon. Robert Bourke was also a successful politician. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (attaining BA in 1844, MA in 1851, and LLD in 1852). He and his brothers were accomplished horsemen and enjoyed fox hunting.

==Political career==

After travelling in Russia, detailed in his &quot;St. Petersburg and Moscow&quot; (1846), Mayo was elected MP for Kildare (1847–52), Coleraine (1852–7) and Cockermouth (1857–68). He was thrice appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland – in 1852, 1858 and 1866 – and in 1869 he became the fourth Viceroy of India where he was locally often referred to as &quot;Lord Mayo&quot;. He consolidated the frontiers of India and reorganised the country&#x27;s finances; he also did much to promote irrigation, railways, forests and other useful public works. To solve local problems he established local boards. During his tenure the first census took place in 1872. He founded Mayo College at Ajmer for the education of young Indian chiefs, with £70,000 being subscribed by the chiefs themselves.

==Assassination==

While visiting the convict settlement at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands in 1872 for the purpose of inspection, he was assassinated by Sher Ali Afridi, a former Afghan soldier who had been convicted for murdering a relative. He vowed to kill two British officials to avenge the suffering he had to undergo. Mayo&#x27;s body was brought home to Ireland and buried at the medieval ruined church in Johnstown, County Kildare, near his home at Palmerstown House. Afridi was hanged on March 11, 1872.

==Memorials==
=== Lord Mayo March ===
The traditional Irish march &quot;Lord Mayo&quot; (&quot;Tiagharna Mhaighe-eo&quot;) was named after him; according to tradition, it was composed by his harper David Murphy to appease Mayo after Murphy angered him.

=== &quot;Papilio mayo&quot; Butterfly ===
In 1873, the newly discovered swallowtail butterfly &quot;Papilio mayo&quot; from the Andaman Islands was named in his honour. 

===St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral===
A Memorial to Lord Mayo is in the third recess of the South Wall at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

===Statue in Cockermouth, Cumbria===
On 19 August 1875, a statue of Lord Mayo was unveiled in the centre of the main street in the town of Cockermouth. The 800-guinea cost of the statue (made by Messrs. Willis of London) had been raised by public subscription. The unveiling was attended by Mayo&#x27;s son, the 7th Earl; Lord Napier and Ettrick; Harvey Goodwin, Bishop of Carlisle; and the Earl of Lonsdale. The statue, carved in Sicilian marble, depicts Lord Mayo in his viceregal garb, and still stands today.

===Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan===
Mayo Hospital is one of the oldest and biggest hospitals in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The hospital is named after then Viceroy of British India, &quot;Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo&quot; also locally known as Lord Mayo.

=== Statue at Albert Hall Museum, Jaipur, India ===
A statue of Lord Mayo had been installed in the premises of Mayo Hospital (currently known as the Mahilya Chikatsalya, Jaipur). The cast-iron statue, weighing around 3 tons, was ordered sculpted by the Maharaja Ram Singh ji of Jaipur, as a tribute to Lord Mayo after his assassination. The sculptors were J. Forsyth and R. Monti. The company&#x27;s name as inscribed on the statue was R. Masefield &amp; Co., London. 

This statue of Lord Mayo had been buried in the premises of the Albert Hall Museum of Jaipur at the time of the independence of India in 1947 to prevent vandalism. After six decades, this statue was unearthed by the Jaipur Mayo Alumni Chapter on 29 May 2007. It was later removed from the Albert Hall Museum in Jaipur and sent to Mayo College, in Ajmer, India, where it is now installed. 

=== Mayo College, Ajmer, India ===
Mayo College, Ajmer, India, was founded after the death of Lord Mayo in 1875. The College, named in honour of Lord Mayo, already had a full life-size statue of him sculpted in white marble installed in front of its famous main building since inception and a marble sculpted bust of him in its school museum. The College accepted the statue of Lord Mayo which was unearthed at Mayo Hospital, Jaipur in 2007.

==Marriage and children==
Mayo married Hon Blanche Julia Wyndham (1826–1918), daughter of George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield, in 1848. Lady Mayo served as Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria from 1872, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE).

Lord and Lady Mayo had seven children:

* Hon. Norah Mary (14 March 1850 – 23 May 1851), died in infancy 
* Lady Eva Constance Aline Bourke (16 August 1858 – 19 January 1940), married Windham Wyndham-Quin, 5th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl

<text>British Caledonian (BCal) was a private independent airline in the United Kingdom that operated from 1970 until it merged with British Airways in 1988. It operated primarily from London Gatwick Airport in south-east England. BCal was formed by the merger of Caledonian Airways and British United Airways (BUA). It was created as an alternative to the British government-controlled corporation airlines and was described as the &quot;Second Force&quot; in the 1969 Edwards report. The carrier slogan was &quot;Let&#x27;s go British Caledonian&quot; in the 1970s and &quot;We never forget you have a choice&quot; in the 1980s. The BUA takeover enabled Caledonian to realise its long-held ambition to transform itself into a scheduled airline. The merged entity eventually became the UK&#x27;s foremost independent, international scheduled airline.

A series of major financial setbacks during the mid-1980s combined with the airline&#x27;s inability to grow sufficiently to reach a viable size put it at serious risk of collapse. British Caledonian began looking for a merger partner to improve its competitive position. In December 1987, British Airways (BA) bought the airline. The Caledonian name was used to rebrand BA&#x27;s Gatwick-based subsidiary British Airtours as Caledonian Airways.

==History==

=== Inception ===

On St. Andrew&#x27;s Day (30 November) in 1970, Caledonian Airways acquired British United Airways (BUA) from British and Commonwealth (B&amp;C) for £6.9 million. Caledonian Airways also purchased three new BAC One-Eleven 500 aircraft, which B&amp;C had leased to BUA, for a further £5 million.

Caledonian&#x27;s acquisition of BUA from B&amp;C did not include the assets of British United Island Airways (BUIA), BUA&#x27;s regional affiliate.

BCal was a wholly owned subsidiary of Caledonian Airways Ltd. BCal itself had a number of subsidiaries as well. Amongst these were Caledonian Airways Equipment Holdings and Caledonian Airways (Leasing), which were set up to acquire and dispose of aircraft on behalf of the airline as well as to sell maintenance, training and management expertise to third parties. BCal also owned two package holiday companies as well as several hotels in Spain and Sierra Leone. BCal also inherited BUA&#x27;s minority stakes in Gambia Airways, Sierra Leone Airways and Uganda Aviation Services.

The airline&#x27;s formation followed publication of the Edwards report entitled &quot;British Air Transport in the Seventies&quot; in 1969. and a subsequent White paper from the government The report recommended the creation of a &quot;Second Force&quot;, private sector carrier to take on the state-owned corporations — British European Airways (BEA) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) — by providing competing domestic and international scheduled services on trunk routes. The government rejected the proposed transfer of routes from BOAC and BEA to the Second Force, and held that dual designation on a route should be open to any British independent. The new airline established its headquarters and operational base at Gatwick Airport and Sir Adam Thomson, one of the five co-founders as well as one of the main shareholders of Caledonian Airways, became its chairman and managing director.

BCal was a full member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at its inception as a result of inheriting BUA&#x27;s membership. This included membership of IATA&#x27;s trade association as well as participation in tariff co-ordination with other member airlines in the organisation&#x27;s annual traffic conferences. BCal also had its own air freight terminal at Heathrow

BCal inherited from its predecessors 31 jet aircraft: 11 long-haul aircraft (seven ex-Caledonian Boeing 707s and four ex-BUA Vickers VC10) and 20 short-haul planes (eight ex-BUA and four ex-Caledonian BAC One-Eleven 500s and eight ex-BUA BAC One-Eleven 200s). The issued share capital was £12 million — more than that of any other wholly private, British independent airline at the time — and its workforce numbered 4,400.

This made BCal the UK&#x27;s foremost independent airline of the time. Although Dan-Air and Britannia Airways exceeded BCal&#x27;s total annual passenger numbers from 1975, BCal maintained its position as Britain&#x27;s leading independent international scheduled airline, in terms of both the number of scheduled passengers carried each year and the total yearly scheduled capacity measured in passenger kilometres, throughout its 17-year existence.) The newly created company&#x27;s output measured in available capacity tonne kilometres was greater than that of some of the smaller, contemporary European flag carriers, such as Aer Lingus, Air India, Sabena, or Swissair. By that measure, BCal was about the same size as Australia&#x27;s flag carrier Qantas.

The institutional investors that had helped Sir Adam Thomson and John de la Haye launch Caledonian Airways back in 1961 were also among the shareholders of the newly constituted airline. They included The Automobile Association (AA), Great Universal Stores (GUS), Hogarth Shipping, Lyle Shipping, Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC) — one of the two predecessors of Investors in Industry, Kleinwort Benson, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Schroders. (Airways Interests (Thomson), which had been set up at Caledonian&#x27;s inception a decade earlier as an investment vehicle for that airline&#x27;s founders to enable them to maintain control, was renamed Caledonian Airways Ltd and became the new group holding company.)

Before adopting the British Caledonian name, the new airline legally constituted two separate entities — Caledonian Airways (Prestwick) Ltd and British United Airways Ltd. These traded together under the interim name Caledonian//BUA until September 1971. The combined airline carried a total of 2.6 million passengers during its first year of operation.

For accounting purposes, BCal&#x27;s aircraft were respectively allocated to a &quot;BUA Division&quot; and &quot;Caledonian Division&quot; during the interim period. The former was responsible for all IATA activities. This encompassed all scheduled services. The latter was responsible for all non-IATA work. This included all non-scheduled operations. At that time, two-thirds of all passengers were carried on charter flights.

During that period, former BUA air hostesses still wearing that airline&#x27;s blue uniforms were working alongside their tartan-clad, former Caledonian counterparts in the cabins of all passenger flights. Eventually, the Caledonian tartan uniforms became BCal&#x27;s standard for female staff.

Following the interim period, Caledonian Airways (Prestwick) Ltd and British United Airways Ltd were merged into British Caledonian Airways Ltd (BCal). All former BUA aircraft were repainted adopting Caledonian&#x27;s livery featuring a prominent Scottish Lion Rampant on its aircraft&#x27;s fins. At that time, all aircraft were named after famous Scots and well-known Scottish places. This tradition was continued throughout the airline&#x27;s 17-year existence. Some BCal aircraft were also allocated out-of-sequence registrations. (For instance, G-BCAL was allocated to one of the Boeing 707s, G-CLAN and G-SCOT were the registrations of the Piper Navajo Chieftains, G-DCIO was the registration of the eighth DC-10 and G-HUGE was the Boeing 747 Combi registration)

The &quot;Second Force&quot; inherited BUA&#x27;s extensive network of scheduled routes serving the British Isles, Continental Europe, Africa and South America. Its scheduled ambitions were aided by the British Government transferring to it BOAC&#x27;s West African trunk routes to Nigeria and Ghana as well as the corporation&#x27;s North African route to Libya. These routes represented only 3% of BOAC&#x27;s annual, worldwide turnover.

The Government also agreed to let it serve Casablanca in Morocco from Gatwick in competition with BEA&#x27;s service from Heathrow. Furthermore, the Government agreed to license BCal to operate non-stop scheduled services between London and Paris and to begin negotiations with the French authorities to secure reciprocal approval for BCal to be able to commence scheduled operations on what was then the busiest international air route in Europe. BCal moreover received Government assurances that it would be designated as the UK&#x27;s sole flag carrier on all routes transferred to it and that it would be assisted in obtaining traffic rights for additional, selected scheduled routes where it wished to compete with the corporations, including the lucrative London—New York and London—Los Angeles routes.

Another important concession by the Government designed to improve the competitiveness of the &quot;Second Force&quot; was to permit it to provide a first class cabin on its East African routes. (BUA, from whom BCal inherited these routes, had been prevented from offering a first class on its East African routes. To compensate for this loss of competitiveness, Sir Freddie Laker, BUA&#x27;s managing director from 1960 to 1965, had come up with the idea of designing a cargo door to be installed on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage of that airline&#x27;s long-haul VC10s, where the first class cabin was normally located. This modification permitted the carriage of additional freight instead of first class passengers on the East African routes.)

In addition, BCal became the Government&#x27;s &quot;chosen instrument of the private sector&quot;. This meant that the Government agreed to accord preferential status to BCal&#x27;s worldwide scheduled ambitions, especially in the award of additional licences to operate scheduled services on major domestic and international trunk routes. The Government hoped that putting BCal&#x27;s requirements ahead of other UK-based independent airlines&#x27; rival scheduled ambitions would help the new &quot;Second Force&quot; develop into a fully fledged, major international scheduled airline, thereby enabling it to achieve the critical mass to challenge the corporations&#x27; near-monopoly among UK-based scheduled airlines.

The Central London air terminal at Victoria Station in London&#x27;s West End, which the &quot;Second Force&quot; inherited from BUA as well, allowed passengers to complete all check-in formalities, including dropping off their hold luggage, before boarding their train to the airport.

BCal also had a Gatwick airside lounge for its premium passengers, which it named &quot;Clansmen Lounge&quot;.

=== Formative years ===
BCal commenced scheduled operations from Gatwick to Nigeria (Lagos and Kano) and Ghana (Accra) in April 1971. Scheduled services from Gatwick to Tripoli began in July 1971. On each of these routes BCal replaced BOAC as the designated UK flag carrier. On 1 November 1971, BCal started scheduled flights between London Gatwick and Paris Le Bourget Airport, where it replaced BEA&#x27;s London Heathrow—Paris Le Bourget service and competed with that airline&#x27;s Heathrow—Paris Orly Airport service. This was the first time since the 1930s that an independent airline commenced a scheduled service on that trunk route.

BCal ended its 1970/71 financial year to 30 September 1971 with a profit of £1.7 million (after accounting for BUA&#x27;s £600,000 loss)

In 1972, BCal extended its East African network to the Seychelles. The same year it also introduced a new Edinburgh—Newcastle—Copenhagen regional scheduled service to live up to its claim of being &quot;Scotland&#x27;s international airline&quot;. This complemented the Glasgow—Newcastle—Amsterdam regional route BCal had inherited from BUA.

1972 was also the year BCal introduced the UK&#x27;s first-ever &quot;no frills&quot; type service on the two main domestic trunk routes linking London and Scotland. The airline introduced simultaneous night-time departures from Gatwick, Glasgow and Edinburgh, resulting in an overall frequency increase to six daily round-trips on each route. The company charged a very low £5 one-way fare on these night-time services, which were marketed under the &quot;Moonjet&quot; trademark. This move, which was modelled on the high-frequency-low-fares operation run by Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), the original &quot;no frills&quot; airline, along the busy San Diego—Los Angeles—San Francisco air corridor in California, boosted passenger numbers and profitability on both routes.

During that year, larger capacity, longer range and more fuel-efficient Boeing 707s replaced VC10s on BCal&#x27;s South American routes, where the 707&#x27;s greater range enabled the airline to run non-stop flights between London Gatwick and Rio de Janeiro, as well as on the West African trunk routes to Nigeria and Ghana.

As a result of the then prevailing, ruinous rates in the charter market, which still accounted for half of BCal&#x27;s business, the airline incurred a loss of £194,000 during the financial year to 30 September 1972.

To support its ambitious expansion plans, BCal acquired a number of additional, second-hand Boeing 707s from various sources through its aircraft trading and leasing subsidiaries during the early 1970s. These included a pair of 320C series aircraft procured on a long-term lease from Britannia Airways featuring a two-class, &quot;widebody look&quot; interior. Another three 707s received re-modelled &quot;widebody&quot; cabins. All five were used to inaugurate the airline&#x27;s transatlantic scheduled routes to New York and Los Angeles where the established competition was operating widebodied aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 &quot;jumbo jet&quot;. It was thought that the aircraft&#x27;s widebody style interiors would leave passengers with the impression that BCal was operating widebodied aircraft when in fact it was not. During that time, BCal placed an order with the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) for two new One-Eleven 500s and acquired additional second-hand examples. At the same time, the airline disposed of some of its 707s, VC10s and One-Eleven 200s. These included the original pair of 399C series 707 aircraft that had been delivered to Caledonian Airways direct from the manufacturer in 1967/68.

BCal inaugurated its two transatlantic flagship services from London Gatwick to John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) on 1 April 1973, followed by Gatwick — Los Angeles International a few days later. Earl Mountbatten of Burma was BCal&#x27;s chief guest on board its inaugural Gatwick—JFK flight. (The flight diverted to Boston due to inclement weather in the New York area.) This occasion marked the first time that a British independent airline commenced non-stop transatlantic scheduled services on routes linking the UK and the US. Also on 1 April 1973, BCal replaced the two-letter CA airline designator – which was originally used to prefix all Caledonian Airways flight numbers and continued to prefix flight numbers allocated to transatlantic charter flights until 31 March 1973 – with the BR airline designator it had inherited from BUA at the time of its formation. This resulted in exclusive use of the BR designator as a prefix for all BCal flight numbers.

In 1973, BCal also inaugurated its fourth scheduled domestic trunk route between London Gatwick and Manchester. The new service was contracted to British Island Airways (BIA), BUIA&#x27;s successor, which operated two daily return trips using its Handley Page Dart Herald turboprops.

On 20 March 1974, BCal switched its Gatwick—Paris services to the then brand-new Charles de Gaulle Airport in the northern Paris suburb of Roissy-en-France, thus becoming the first scheduled carrier to operate between London and the new Paris airport.

To further extend the network&#x27;s reach and improve its connectivity, BCal agreed to host Dan-Air&#x27;s new, twice daily Gatwick—Newcastle flights, which began on 20 April 1974, in its computer reservation system (CRS) as part of a combined marketing effort.

June 1974 saw the launch of BCal&#x27;s non-stop Gatwick—Brussels scheduled route, the third European trunk route on which the airline operated scheduled services in competition with the incumbent flag carriers&#x27; established services from Heathrow.

=== 1974 crisis year ===
The creation of British Airways (BA) as a result of the 1974 BEA-BOAC merger came against the background of the first global oil crisis in the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which led to the quadrupling of the price of a barrel of oil as a consequence of the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to boycott the West in retaliation for its support of Israel during that war. This meant that the newly merged corporation&#x27;s original revenue and profit projections were far too optimistic. During that time, BA began exerting pressure on the Government, at the time its sole owner as well as the regulator for all UK airlines, to curtail the activities of its independent competitors generally and of the &quot;Second Force&quot; in particular.

The difficult operating environment at the time did not affect BA alone. In fact, the major scheduled airlines were all losing enormous amounts of money at the time. The sudden spike in the oil price caused a major recession during the second half of 1974 as well as the first half of 1975, with much reduced demand for air travel. This in turn led to the collapse of a number of prominent travel companies and their associated airlines — most notably the Court Line group and Horizon Holidays, the latter having provided work for three BCal short-haul aircraft prior to its collapse. There was also massive overcapacity on the North Atlantic routes.

These circumstances forced BCal to put in place a major programme of retrenchment, known internally as Plan &quot;S&quot; (from &quot;survival&quot;) Plan &quot;S&quot; began to be implemented from 1 November 1974. It resulted in route cut-backs — including the suspension of the transatlantic &quot;flagship&quot; services, of which &quot;Flight International&quot; said the fuel crisis was a &quot;heaven-sent excuse&quot; to back out of a failure. the immediate withdrawal and subsequent disposal of the remaining VC10 long-haul aircraft, the grounding of a number of short-haul aircraft as well 827 redundancies out of the company&#x27;s 5,673 staff. It also resulted in organisational changes that saw Adam Thomson become the airline&#x27;s chief executive in addition to continuing in his role as chairman of a reconstituted board, and the transfer of all aircraft leasing, purchase and sale activities to a new subsidiary. British Caledonian Aircraft Trading was the name of the company that succeeded Caledonian Airways Equipment Holdings, Caledonian Airways (Leasing) and other related interests. It became one of the most profitable parts of the business.

In addition to withdrawing from the prestigious long-haul routes to New York and Los Angeles after only 18 months, other specific measures the airline took at the time to ensure its survival included dropping all scheduled flights to Belfast, Copenhagen, Gibraltar, Ibiza, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca and Tunis, indefinitely suspending scheduled services on the Glasgow—Southampton route as well as cutting the number of frequencies on the Gatwick—Glasgow and Gatwick—Edinburgh routes from six to four daily round trips. Two surplus aircraft were leased out to Air Malta and Austrian Airlines respectively for the duration of the 1975 summer timetable period. Another aircraft was stationed at West Berlin&#x27;s Tegel Airport during the month of July of that year to fulfill a short-term charter contract to carry Turkish migrant workers to and from Istanbul on behalf of a local tour operator. BCal also decided to increase its 707 freighter fleet from one to four aircraft and to acquire a five-seater Piper Aztec to serve the rapidly growing executive charter market. These changes left BCal with 25 operational aircraft for the 1975 summer season. To reduce operating costs further, the airline decided to contract out its scheduled operations between Gatwick and Le Touquet to BIA. The reason for replacing BCal&#x27;s One-Eleven 200 jet aircraft on this route with that airline&#x27;s Herald turboprops at the beginning of the 1975 summer timetable period was the high price of jet fuel, which had made BCal&#x27;s own jet aircraft operations uneconomic.

Even during this period of severe retrenchment, BCal continued launching scheduled services to new destinations. Dakar joined the airline&#x27;s network on 1 November 1974, followed by Kinshasa on 1 April 1975.

As a result of the &quot;success&quot; of Plan &quot;S&quot;, BCal&#x27;s fortunes quickly recovered. The airline operation itself made a small profit of £250,000 during the financial year ended 30 September 1975 after having lost £4.3 million the year before.

=== Spheres of influence ===

The then Trade Secretary Peter Shore conducted a review of the Government&#x27;s aviation policy and in 1976 announced a new &quot;spheres of influence&quot; policy that ended dual designation for British airlines on all long-haul routes. It was no longer believed that competition was increasing the UK market share of the traffic. As a result, BA and BCal were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled services on long-haul routes, and BCal had to withdraw from the East African routes inherited from BUA as well as from the London—New York and London—Los Angeles routes. BCal lost its licences to New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Toronto – routes it had stopped running in 1974. It gained Lusaka (Zambia) In return, BCal became the sole British flag carrier to the entire South American mainland by taking over the former BA routes to Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. The net losses of revenues was about equal for the two airlines.

The Government&#x27;s new &quot;spheres of influence&quot; aviation policy confined BCal&#x27;s long-haul scheduled operations to two continents — Africa and South America. The loss of BCal&#x27;s East African routes enabled the airline to replace the one-stop scheduled service via Nairobi to Lusaka with non-stop flights.

During 1976, BCal&#x27;s recovery continued, leading to the introduction of a new scheduled route to Algiers and the reinstatement of scheduled services to Tunis. It also led to BCal&#x27;s decision to replace the two daily Gatwick—Manchester round-trips BIA had operated with turboprops with a BCal One-Eleven service from the start of the 1976–77 winter timetable period. This equipment change was accompanied by the addition of a third daily frequency.

BCal ended its 1975/76 financial year with a healthy profit of £5.6 million.

=== Bermuda II treaty ===
In July 1976, Edmund Dell, the then new Secretary of State for Trade, renounced the original Bermuda air services agreement of 1946 and initiated bilateral negotiations with his US counterparts on a new air services agreement, which resulted in the Bermuda II Agreement of 1977. This presented BCal with new transatlantic opportunities to begin scheduled services to additional gateway cities in the US.

Under the new agreement, BCal had its licences to commence scheduled services from its Gatwick base to both Houston and Atlanta confirmed and was designated as the UK&#x27;s exclusive flag carrier on both routes. It also obtained a licence and sole UK flag carrier status to commence scheduled services from Gatwick to Dallas–Fort Worth. In addition, BCal obtained a licence and sole UK flag carrier status to commence scheduled all cargo flights between Gatwick and Houston — including an optional stop at Manchester or Prestwick in either direction.

During the Bermuda II negotiations, the UK side succeeded in having inserted into the new air services agreement a clause stating that Gatwick — rather than Heathrow — was to be nominated as the designated US flag carrier&#x27;s London gateway airport whenever BCal was going to be the sole designated UK flag carrier on the same route. This clause was meant to support the growth of BCal&#x27;s scheduled operation at Gatwick as well as to redress the competitive imbalance between it and its much bigger, more powerful rivals.

The UK side furthermore succeeded in negotiating a three-year exclusivity period for the incumbent operator on any new route with their US counterparts.

For Gatwick-based BCal this meant that it did not have to face any competitor that was using Heathrow, a more accessible airport with a bigger catchment area and a far greater number of passengers connecting between flights, on any of the new routes it was planning to launch to the US. It also meant that it had any new route to the US completely to itself for the first three years of operation, which most airline industry analysts reckon is sufficiently long for a brand-new scheduled air service to become profitable.

At British insistence, Bermuda II furthermore contained clauses that made it illegal for any airline operating scheduled flights between the UK and the US to resort to predatory pricing or capacity dumping. Air fares were only approved if they reflected the actual cost of providing these services. Similarly, capacity increases were sanctioned on a reciprocal basis only. The reason for insisting on the inclusion of these provisions in the Bermuda II agreement was to prevent the much bigger, better financed and commercially far more aggressive US carriers from undercutting BCal with loss-leading fares cross-subsidised with profits those carriers&#x27; vast domestic networks generated, as well as to stop them from marginalising the UK carrier by adding capacity far in excess of what the market could sustain.

Both sides also agreed to continue dual designation on the London—New York and London—Los Angeles routes. The principle of dual designation was to be extended to another two high-volume routes.

BCal resumed scheduled transatlantic services on 24 October 1977. The airline became the first UK carrier to launch a daily, non-stop London (Gatwick)—Houston scheduled service as well as a weekly, direct all-cargo service on the same route, which operated via Prestwick on the outbound leg and via Manchester on the return leg. BCal inaugurated the daily scheduled passenger flights with a Boeing 707-320C narrow-bodied aircraft. In April 1978, BCal re-configured the 707s plying this route in a three-class layout, which featured a dedicated &quot;Executive&quot; cabin, in addition to a first and an economy class section. This was the first time since the beginning of the jet age that a scheduled airline had offered a &quot;third&quot; class specifically aimed at the business traveller. It was intended to replace the 707s operating the all-passenger services with a brand-new, larger capacity as well as more fuel-efficient DC-10 widebodied aircraft at the start of the 1978/79 winter timetable period.

=== Beginning of the widebody era ===

Following an exhaustive, three-week evaluation of the Boeing 747, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar during the early summer of 1976, BCal chose the DC-10 as the wide-bodied aircraft best suited to serve its expanding long-haul route network. The immediate availability of the aircraft was important so there was no British-engine option, the 747 too large and the Tristar could not be delivered in time. On 3 June 1976, the airline placed a US$70 million order for two long-range series 30 aircraft with an option on another two. To ensure an early delivery, the company took over a delivery slot for two aircraft that had originally been booked by China Airlines.

On 13 March 1977, the first of the two DC-10s ordered arrived at the airline&#x27;s Gatwick base from Prestwick at the end of a delivery flight from the manufacturer&#x27;s plant in Long Beach, California.

The aircraft, which was configured in a 265-seat, two-class layout, entered commercial service on BCal&#x27;s busy West African trunk routes to Nigeria and Ghana later the same month, replacing the airline&#x27;s Boeing 707s on six of the seven weekly services on these routes.

The second aircraft, which arrived at Gatwick in early May of that year, was initially configured in a 295-seat, single-class layout. It entered service later that month on BCal&#x27;s Advance Booking Charter (ABC) routes to the US and Canada. The aircraft was re-configured in the airline&#x27;s contemporary, 265-seat, two-class scheduled layout at the end of the summer period. It replaced Boeing 707s on two of BCal&#x27;s three weekly South Atlantic schedules to Brazil, Argentina and Chile, as well as on one of the company&#x27;s two weekly mid-Atlantic schedules to Venezuela, Colombia and Peru from the beginning of the 1977/78 winter timetable period.

The DC-10&#x27;s superior operating economics compared with the 707 enabled BCal to operate the aircraft non-stop from Buenos Aires to Gatwick with a viable payload.

Although the introduction of the DC-10 resulted in a huge increase in BCal&#x27;s long-haul passenger and cargo capacity, the actual loads exceeded the airline&#x27;s forecasts and helped it grow its traffic volumes on its scheduled services to West Africa and South America.

BCal was so pleased with the DC-10&#x27;s performance that it decided to convert both of the options it had taken when placing the original order for two aircraft during 1976 into firm orders for delivery in autumn 1978 and spring 1979 respectively. However, a subsequent strike at the manufacturer&#x27;s plant meant that McDonnell Douglas could not honour its delivery schedules. This necessitated the temporary lease of a Boeing 747-100 from Aer Lingus, and the use of BA flightdeck crews to operate the aircraft. The aircraft, which wore a slightly modified BCal livery, was operating the Gatwick—Houston schedule during the 1978/79 winter timetable period to cover for the late delivery of the airline&#x27;s third DC-10.

=== Attaining success ===
By 1978, BCal had fully recovered from the 1974 crisis year, which had threatened its very existence at that time. After the severe contraction forced upon it by the early 1970s&#x27; oil crisis, the company&#x27;s core scheduled operation was growing again with new widebodied aircraft and routes being added and schedules being expanded. Business was booming with planes being fuller than at any time in the firm&#x27;s history. The airline recorded a pre-tax profit of £12.2 million during its 1977/78 financial year to 31 October 1978. This translated into a £10 million retained profit. It was the company&#x27;s best financial result since its formation back in November 1970. BCal&#x27;s senior management decided to allocate £644,000 of the retained profit to a new profit-share scheme to reward its staff for their hard work, and as an incentive for the future. BCal&#x27;s profit-share scheme, which began the following year, was one of the first of its kind in the UK airline industry.

BCal also became a &quot;scheduled service only&quot; airline during 1978, implementing a decision taken the year before when the share of passengers travelling on charter flights had declined to just 15% of all passengers carried. There were two reasons for BCal&#x27;s withdrawal from the charter market:

* A 25% contraction of the transatlantic ABC flights market as a result of the initial success of the daily Laker Airways &quot;Skytrain&quot; low-fares, &quot;no frills&quot; scheduled operation between London Gatwick and New York JFK, which had begun in the previous year&#x27;s autumn season.
* A steady decline in charter rates in the European package tour holiday market where BCal used to supply whole-plane charter seats to its Blue Sky Holidays tour operator affiliate as well as third party tour companies.

1978 was also the first year BCal operated the majority of its scheduled services plying the prime long-haul routes to West Africa and South America with widebody equipment.

At the start of that year&#x27;s summer timetable period, flight frequencies on BCal&#x27;s Gatwick—Glasgow and Gatwick—Amsterdam routes increased to five round-trips per day on week days. During that period, the airline also resumed its Edinburgh—Newcastle—Copenhagen service, which it had abandoned in 1974.

During 1978, Abidjan and Birmingham joined BCal&#x27;s scheduled route network. At the start of the 1978/79 winter timetable period, Benghazi joined the network. At that time, the airline also increased frequencies between London Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle to seven daily round-trips on week days, with flights operating at two-hourly intervals. The addition of twice-weekly flights to the Libyan port city of Benghazi to the existing five weekly services to Tripoli meant that for the first time BCal was able to offer its passengers daily flights to Libya, an important market for profitable, oil-related business travel. BCal&#x27;s introduction of a 747 on the daily Gatwick—Houston schedule furthermore enabled it to replace its two-class configured One-Eleven 500s on the West African coastal schedule to Banjul (The Gambia) and Freetown (Sierra Leone) via Casablanca and Las Palmas with 707s. The 707&#x27;s greater range enabled it to cut out intermediate stops and offer its passengers a more convenient, direct routeing that took less time. BCal replaced two-class One-Elevens operating on the Tripoli route with 707s.

In early 1978, BCal introduced an updated livery.

1978 was furthermore the year Adam Thomson held the chairmanship of the Association of European Airlines (AEA).

In addition, the British Airports Authority had just completed the first phase of a major refurbishment and extension of BCal&#x27;s Gatwick base. The centrepiece of this revamp was a completely refurbished centre pier featuring 11 telescopic, widebody-compatible loading bridges. These were the first loading bridges to be installed at Gatwick, which was a single-terminal airport at the time. For the first time in its history, BCal also gained a dedicated check-in area for all its flights.

The year before, the Government had announced its intention to take pro-active steps to help ensure Gatwick&#x27;s development as a genuine alternative to Heathrow. It was hoped that this in turn would assist BCal&#x27;s development as a serious alternative to BA and the other major, established scheduled airlines. These steps included inviting BCal and Britain&#x27;s other independent airlines to apply to the CAA for route licences to operate scheduled services to destinations in the British Isles and in Continental Europe that were not already served from Gatwick, thereby increasing the reach of the airport&#x27;s scheduled route network as well as providing more connecting traffic for BCal.

BCal was keen to expand its limited short-haul European network beyond the existing four routes linking London Gatwick with Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Brussels National and Genoa. The airline needed to develop its connecting traffic at Gatwick by growing the European network to include destinations in Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia and southern Europe to help it increase load factors on its long-haul flights to Africa, South America and the US as well as to improve the profitability of these services. The airline had planned to commence new short-haul scheduled services from Gatwick to Copenhagen, Gothenburg, Oslo and Stockholm during summer 1978, using the licences the CAA had awarded it the year before. However, BCal was unable to use its newly awarded licences as there was no provision in the bilateral air services agreements the UK had concluded with Denmark, Norway and Sweden for another carrier to operate scheduled services on the main trunk routes between London and these countries. This meant that BA and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) had an effective monopoly on most routes between the UK and Scandinavia. The UK Government agreed to assist BCal in securing reciprocal traffic rights for the London—Scandinavia licences during its negotiations on a new bilateral air services agreement with its three Scandinavian counterparts in December 1978. It was hoped that this would enable BCal to commence its first-ever scheduled services from London to Scandinavia at the start of the 1979 summer timetable period.

Government initiatives in support of Gatwick&#x27;s development also included new policies to transfer all scheduled services between London and Canada as well as London and the Iberian peninsula from Heathrow to Gatwick by 1 April 1979, banning whole-plane charters at Heathrow and to compel all airlines that were planning to operate a scheduled service to or from London for the first time to use Gatwick instead of Heathrow. The latter policy was officially known as the &quot;London [Air] Traffic Distribution Rules&quot;. It came into effect on 1 April 1978 and was applied retroactively from the beginning of April 1977. These rules were designed to achieve a fairer distribution of traffic between London Heathrow and London Gatwick, the UK&#x27;s two main international gateway airports. The policy was aimed at increasing Gatwick&#x27;s utilisation to help the airport make a profit.

Another pro-active measure the Government took to aid BCal&#x27;s and Gatwick&#x27;s development at the time was to grant permission for Airlink, a high-frequency helicopter shuttle service linking both of London&#x27;s main airports. The new helicopter shuttle service linking London Heathrow and London Gatwick was inaugurated on 9 June 1978.

This service was operating 10 times a day in each direction using a 28-seater Sikorsky S-61N helicopter, which was owned by the BAA. BCal held the licence to operate the service, provided the cabin crew and was in charge of reservations and ticketing. British Airways Helicopters, the wholly owned helicopter subsidiary of BA whose headquarters were located at Gatwick, provided the flightdeck crew and engineering support.

The service gave BCal&#x27;s passengers easier access to flight connections at Heathrow, especially to destinations not served by scheduled flights from Gatwick at the time.

It was used by 60,000 passengers during the first year of its operation.

1978 was also the year BCal set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA&#x27;s former Concorde director, to investigate the possibility of operating the Concorde supersonic airliner viably on the airline&#x27;s long-haul route network as there were still two unsold, &quot;white tail&quot; examples available at that time.

Another important reason for BCal&#x27;s decision to set up a Concorde task force was that the 1976 aviation policy review had exempted Concorde from the &quot;spheres of influence&quot; policy and therefore it was possible for BA to operate supersonic services to prime business and leisure destinations within BCal&#x27;s sphere of influence, such as Lagos or Rio de Janeiro for example. To ward off this potential threat, BCal&#x27;s senior management decided to develop its own Concorde plans, either independently or in partnership with BA.

The most obvious choice for a supersonic service was Gatwick—Lagos, the backbone and main money spinner of BCal&#x27;s scheduled operation. BCal&#x27;s Concorde task force&#x27;s brief was to assess the viability of a second daily all-premium supersonic service complementing the airline&#x27;s existing daily subsonic, mixed-class widebody service on this route.

BCal put in a bid to acquire one of the remaining two &quot;white tail&quot; aircraft. The bid was not successful.

However, BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively and to have them maintained by either BA or Air France. It became necessary to find additional work for BCal&#x27;s envisaged two-strong Concorde fleet to increase the aircraft&#x27;s utilisation, thus permitting a cost-effective operation. Therefore, BCal decided to use the second aircraft to launch a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a at either Gander or Halifax. It also considered using the aircraft to serve Houston and points on its South American network at a later stage.

Both supersonic services were to be launched at the start of the 1980 summer timetable period.

In 1979, the airline took delivery of its delayed third and fourth McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodied aircraft during the first and third quarter. This permitted the aircraft&#x27;s introduction on its daily Gatwick—Houston schedule as well as the replacement of the remaining 707-operated services on its mid- and South Atlantic routes. The narrow-bodied capacity released was used to add frequencies on existing routes as well as to launch services to new medium- and long-haul destinations. As a result, BCal launched a fourth weekly service to Brazil. It also launched a new route to Oran and added Quito and Guayaquil to the mid-Atlantic schedule. The company furthermore increased frequencies on its short-haul routes. A fourth daily round-trip was added to both Gatwick—Manchester and Gatwick—Brussels. A third daily frequency operating on week days was added to the Newcastle—Amsterdam sector of BCal&#x27;s Glasgow—Newcastle—Amsterdam regional route.
During that year, BCal also established a wholly owned helicopter subsidiary and it placed the UK launch order for a brand-new widebodied aircraft, the Airbus A310.

This was also the time BCal came up with a proposal to create a new network of European low-fare services. These were to be marketed under the trademark &quot;Miniprix&quot; and were meant to counter Laker Airways&#x27;s plans for a pan-European &quot;Skytrain&quot; operation. Excluding BCal&#x27;s existing four European destinations, it envisaged linking Gatwick with 20 additional points on the Continent. These services were to be operated during off-peak times, initially using the airline&#x27;s existing narrowbody aircraft. Only six of 22 licences applied for were granted but even those did not lead to routes as the Department of Trade would not start discussions with the European authorities, which they believed would be blocked due to the destination countries&#x27; domestic concerns. None of Laker&#x27;s 36 applications were approved.

BCal was evaluating both the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 narrowbody as well as the Airbus A310 and Boeing 767 widebodies as suitable long-term replacements for its existing narrow-bodied aircraft on these routes.

BCal&#x27;s setbacks during 1979 included continuing frustration of the airline&#x27;s desire to launch scheduled services to Scandinavia despite the conclusion of a new Anglo-Scandinavian bilateral air services agreement and the temporary grounding of the airline&#x27;s widebodied fleet — three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s — during the second quarter following the crash of American Airlines flight 191, a DC-10-10, in Chicago in May that year.

With their DC-10s grounded, BCal took a short-term lease of a 747 to provide adequate capacity on its Nigerian trunk routes during that period. BCal also operated a Dan-Air Comet on short-term lease between Gatwick and Tripoli while the 707s normally used on that service were redeployed to operate a reduced schedule to Houston and South America. In addition to these aircraft, a Boeing 707-120B was leased during that period as well to cover the shortfall in capacity.

=== Network expansion ===

BCal took delivery of three more McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodied aircraft in 1980.

These planes enabled the launch of new routes – to Atlanta on 1 June, and to Hong Kong on 1 August, though in the latter Cathay Pacific and Laker Airways were also permitted without restriction on frequency or fares. Routes to San Juan, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Isla Verde International Airport, and Dallas/Fort Worth followed on 26 October. It also enabled the airline to replace the Boeing 707s, with which it had inaugurated another new route to St. Louis in April of that year, with its newly delivered DC-10 widebodies at the end of October when St. Louis became a stop on the new Dallas/Fort Worth route. During that year, the company also added Tangier to its North African network.

This accelerated pace of growth made BCal the fastest growing member airline of the Association of European Airlines (AEA) in both 1980 and 1981.

BCal received a boost during 1980, when the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) approved carriers (BCal, Cathay Pacific and Laker – subject to ratification) on the London – Hong Kong route to be able to pick up and put down passengers at intermediate stops in the Gulf states as the Hong Kong route was not otherwise expected to generate enough revenue for four carriers. For BCal this meant using their Dubai refuelling stop to carry passengers, cargo and mail between London and Dubai and Dubai and Hong Kong, despite objections from British Airways (BA) which already had such rights for Dubai and Bahrain.

BCal&#x27;s 10th anniversary on 30 November 1980 coincided with the completion of its new corporate headquarters — aptly named &quot;Caledonian House&quot; — in Crawley&#x27;s Lowfield Heath area close to the airline&#x27;s Gatwick base. It was the first purpose-built headquarters in the company&#x27;s history, which was designed to accommodate all 1,100 office-based staff at the airline&#x27;s Gatwick base under one roof.

The high oil price during that period was a mixed blessing for BCal. It helped the airline fill its premium cabins on its oil-related business routes to Nigeria, Libya and Texas. On the other hand, the escalation of the jet fuel price and the fact that the high price of oil had considerably worsened the severe recession in Britain at that time significantly increased the company&#x27;s operating costs, while at the same time reducing overall demand for its flights. BCal therefore decided to reduce off-peak frequencies on most of its short-haul routes from the start of the 1980/81 winter timetable period. This also included combining week-end, off-peak flights from Gatwick to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Manchester by converting non-stop flights into one-stop operations.

Among the set-backs BCal suffered at that time were the CAA&#x27;s rejection of its application to serve Manila (Philippines) from Hong Kong or Singapore and BA&#x27;s successful lobbying of the Government to revoke BCal&#x27;s long-standing Gatwick—Bahrain—Singapore exempt charter licence in return for having granted it permission to launch a fully fledged scheduled service to Hong Kong.

BCal ended the 1979/80 financial year with a healthy profit of £9.7 million.

BCal received another new DC-10-30 widebody in 1981. The delivery of this aircraft enabled the airline to increase frequencies on the prime long-haul routes to West Africa from seven to 10 weekly round-trips. It also permitted a frequency increase on the Gatwick—Dubai—Hong Kong route from four to five weekly round-trips.

At the start of the 1981/82 winter timetable period, BCal added Douala (Cameroon) to its network.

Also in 1981, BCal opened a new engine overhaul plant at Prestwick Airport near Glasgow in Scotland. The new engine overhaul plant was owned and run by Caledonian Airmotive, a dedicated, wholly owned subsidiary of the airline, which had been set up with technical support from GE.

BCal&#x27;s search for a more fuel-efficient replacement for its ageing BAC One-Eleven fleet — especially, the range-limited One-Eleven 200s — acquired a new sense of urgency during 1981 against a backdrop of further escalating fuel prices. The airline was evaluating both the new BAe ATP turboprop for entry into service during 1986 and the BAe 146, the UK aircraft manufacturer&#x27;s new, four-engined regional jet that was due to enter service in 1983, in addition to the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and the new Boeing 737-300. Both British Aerospace types were rejected because it was felt that they had insufficient range to permit non-stop flights from BCal&#x27;s Gatwick base to some of the more distant points BCal already served or planned to serve in Europe and North Africa. Moreover, BCal felt that operating a turboprop on trunk routes would meet with passenger resistance as by that time most people had become accustomed to travelling on jets on these routes.

In 1981, BCal applied to the UK and Australian authorities for permission to launch a fully fledged, three-class scheduled service between Gatwick and Brisbane (via Colombo and Melbourne), and between Gatwick and Adelaide (via Perth), at a frequency of two flights a week each, in both directions. BCal proposed to inaugurate what would have been the first ever scheduled operation &quot;Down Under&quot; by a wholly private, British independent airline with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s. BCal wanted this to be a joint operation with Ansett Airlines, one of Australia&#x27;s two leading contemporary domestic airlines, and held out the prospect of placing an order for brand-new, higher capacity Boeing 747-200SUDs to replace the DC-10s on that route as soon as this was justified by increased demand. It also promised to give a major boost to Australia&#x27;s inbound tourism from the UK and to deliver a steady stream of international transfer passengers to Ansett. BCal&#x27;s application did not succeed, mainly because of British Airways&#x27;s and Qantas&#x27;s determined opposition to any move by the authorities in the UK and Australia to dilute the lucrative BA-Qantas duopoly on the &quot;kangaroo route&quot;. The CAA turned down BCal&#x27;s application although it considered it superior to a rival application by Laker Airways as it felt that there was no realistic chance of obtaining reciprocal approval for the proposed service from the relevant Australian authorities, as long as there was no desire on their part to license a second Australian carrier as well. It did promise to look favourably on the application if BCal re-submitted it with specific proposals for a joint Anglo-Australian operation, once Australia no longer opposed licensing additional carriers on that route.

BCal ended its 1980/81 financial year with a £6.2 million loss as a result of high fuel prices, a major recession on both sides of the Atlantic and heavy route development costs.

=== Expanding eastwards ===
As a result of the network structure BCal had inherited from British United Airways (BUA), an exclusive north–south airline, it became a predominantly north–south orientated carrier as well. The predominant north–south route structure had been further reinforced by the 1976 &quot;spheres of influence&quot; policy, which had locked the airline&#x27;s long-haul operation into two continents — Africa and South America.

BCal&#x27;s senior management realised that it needed to develop the traffic flows across its network in an east–west direction to increase the network&#x27;s reach and to enable its passengers to make omnidirectional flight connections. This was also essential to enable the airline to increase its economies of scale and to reach the minimum size envisaged in the Edwards report.

BCal&#x27;s new Gatwick—Dubai—Hong Kong route was intended to be just the first step in this expansion to the East. The Hong Kong route had come about as a result of the UK government decision in 1979 to open up the lucrative route between London and the Crown Colony of Hong Kong to additional competition. This was to be provided by a second British scheduled carrier to ease the shortage of capacity passengers were experiencing at peak times on the monopoly service operated by BA from Heathrow to Hong Kong. BCal, Laker and Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong&#x27;s airline and its &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;flag carrier&quot;, all applied to the CAA.

BCal had proposed running a conventional scheduled service from Gatwick to Hong Kong via Dubai utilising its rapidly growing fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodies in a three-class configuration featuring a first and an executive class in addition to an economy cabin. BCal had also agreed to offer a limited number of low fares that would match the lowest fares Laker had proposed. The CAA decided to license BCal to operate unlimited scheduled services between London and Hong Kong., rejecting both Cathay Pacific&#x27;s and Laker&#x27;s applications, clearing the way for BCal to become the second British scheduled carrier on that route.

However, Hong Kong&#x27;s Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) unexpectedly refused to endorse BCal because many influential people in the Crown Colony felt very upset that Cathay Pacific was going to be excluded from one of the world&#x27;s most lucrative air routes. This caused a minor diplomatic row between the UK government and the colonial administration in Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific immediately began a back-door lobbying campaign in the Crown Colony as well as in London, stressing that it had invested millions of pounds in the British economy at a time of high unemployment in the UK by placing large orders for Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747s. The UK government allowed Cathay Pacific and Laker to appeal to John Nott, the British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, against the CAA&#x27;s decision. Nott overturned the CAA&#x27;s decision opening the route to all three without imposing any restrictions on service frequencies.

With the competition from Cathay Pacific, BCal decided to operate only four weekly round-trips instead of a daily service they had originally planned. Cathay Pacific commenced a thrice-weekly service between Hong Kong and Gatwick via Bahrain on 17 July 1980 ahead of BCal, which began its four-times-a-week Gatwick—Hong Kong service via Dubai on 1 August 1980.

=== Routes to Europe ===
Following BA&#x27;s decision to abandon the short-haul routes it had been operating from London Gatwick at low frequencies since 1978 and to surrender a number of unused licences to the CAA, BCal, Laker Airways and Dan-Air requested the CAA to transfer these licences to themselves.

BCal applied to take over BA&#x27;s London Gatwick—Frankfurt route and its dormant Gatwick—Geneva licence. BCal was awarded licences for both routes.

The fairly liberal bilateral air services agreements between the UK and Germany as well as between the UK and Switzerland enabled BCal to commence double daily flights to Frankfurt and 10 services a week to Geneva within a relatively short time span following the award of the licences. This was the first time since 1974 that BCal was able to launch new routes from Gatwick to Europe. These were BCal&#x27;s first scheduled services to Germany and Switzerland, which were going to be important sources of feeder traffic for the airline&#x27;s long-haul services from Gatwick.

The launch of the two new routes coincided with the introduction of a dedicated business class cabin on all of BCal&#x27;s short-haul flights to Europe, the first time the airline had offered two classes on its short-haul routes since its inception, with the exception of a brief period in the early 1970s during which it had offered a first class on the Gatwick—Paris route. BCal used the &quot;Executive Class&quot; brand for both its new European and its longer established long-haul business class.

=== Falklands War and re-entry into the charter market ===

The 1982 Falklands War was an unexpected, major setback for BCal. Argentina&#x27;s decision to close its airspace and airports to all UK-based airlines as well as to all UK-registered aircraft and Peru&#x27;s decision to follow suit resulted in the loss of the most profitable parts of BCal&#x27;s South American network, especially Buenos Aires — its most profitable destination in that part of the world — and the lucrative &quot;fifth freedom&quot; traffic rights between Madrid and Buenos Aires. That conflict left the airline with an unprofitable rump network because the remaining routes to Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia did not generate sufficient traffic to be profitable on their own, even after a reduction in frequencies. Another negative consequence for BCal was that one of its eight McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodied jets suddenly became surplus to its long-haul scheduled requirements, forcing the airline to look for alternative work to increase long-haul fleet utilisation.

Laker Airways&#x27;s collapse at the beginning of February of that year provided BCal with additional work to utilise its spare aircraft capacity.

Laker Airways&#x27;s demise also enabled BCal to relaunch a daily service between Gatwick and Los Angeles, to acquire six aircraft from the failed carrier&#x27;s estate and to move into the hangar it had occupied at Gatwick. The ex-Laker aircraft that joined BCal&#x27;s fleet included two DC-10-10s and four BAC One-Eleven 300s. BCal used the DC-10-10s to set up a new charter subsidiary named British Caledonian Airways Charter as a joint venture with the Rank Organisation The latter aircraft and three second-hand One-Eleven 500s that had been acquired from other sources replaced BCal&#x27;s seven, ageing One-Eleven 200s.

Despite being a difficult year for BCal, it managed to stay in the black during that period. The airline made a pre-tax profit of £1.1 million, which translated into a £300,000 retained profit, in the financial year to 31 October 1982.

=== Launching a new narrow-bodied aircraft ===
In 1983, BCal became the first non-French airline to order the Airbus A320. BCal placed a firm order for seven A320s and took an option on another three, with deliveries of the aircraft on firm order due to commence during the spring of 1988. The options were subsequently converted into firm orders as well.

Although the A320 was bigger than BCal&#x27;s actual requirement, it was the technologically most advanced contender with 27% lower seat-mile costs than the BAC One-Eleven. Airbus Industrie had also offered the airline a generous discount to sign up as a launch customer. Having BCal [co-]launch a brand-new narrow-bodied aircraft, gave the manufacturer added credibility in its global sales campaigns. This was of particular importance in the all-important US market, which Airbus needed to penetrate with its new aircraft if it wanted to break the stranglehold Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment with the 737 for over 15 years. Airbus knew that the major US carriers would be suspicious of the new aircraft&#x27;s commercial credentials if only state-owned (and at the time subsidised) airlines (Air France and Lufthansa) of countries, whose aerospace industries benefitted from orders, as launch customers. Therefore, having a successful wholly independent airline with a major, worldwide scheduled presence like BCal order a brand-new, technologically advanced aircraft came in handy.

BCal intended to use its A320s to replace the ageing One-Elevens on its short-haul European and medium-haul North African routes.

1983 turned out to be another tough year for BCal. Continuing restrictions on the airline&#x27;s South American services and other schedule cutbacks in response to the early 80s recession reduced aircraft utilisation. This led to a decision to fill spare long-haul aircraft capacity with third-party work. BCal&#x27;s third-party business included a twice weekly Gatwick—Luxembourg—Barbados service on behalf of Caribbean Airways, weekly Gatwick—Frankfurt—Mahé services under contract to Air Seychelles and a wet lease agreement with Surinam Airways to operate a weekly Paramaribo—Gatwick—Amsterdam service. The Caribbean Airways and Air Seychelles contracts used spare capacity on BCal&#x27;s DC-10-30s, while the Surinam Airways wet lease utilised the ex-Laker DC-10-10s operated by British Caledonian Charter. Although BCal&#x27;s airline operation incurred a loss of £655,000 in the financial year to 31 October 1983, the airline managed to make an overall pre-tax profit of £2.6 million. This translated into a £300,000 retained profit at group level.

=== Reorganisation and improved industrial relations ===
During the early 1980s, BCal and its affiliated companies adopted a new organisational structure to reflect the growth in the group&#x27;s business and the diversification into new activities. Caledonian Aviation Group (renamed British Caledonian Group in 1986) became the new holding company. It had an issued share capital of £20 million in June 1987. Apart from the airline, subsidiaries included British Caledonian Aircraft Trading, British Caledonian Flight Training, British Caledonian Helicopters, Caledonian Airmotive, Caledonian Hotel Holdings and Caledonian Leisure Holdings.

In addition, this was the time BCal, which had always prided itself on its industrial relations record, claiming it never lost a full day&#x27;s operation as a result of industrial action began implementing a new co-operative, industrial relations strategy. The airline termed its new industrial relations strategy &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;. This strategy was designed to make the airline the most productive among its peers in Europe by redefining established working practices. Its aim was to achieve a significant reduction in labour costs through increased productivity, thereby putting the firm ahead of its rivals. It was hoped that this would ultimately translate into higher profits as well.

The strategy sought to gain acceptance (among eligible BCal employees) by offering them a higher basic rate of pay and a greater personal involvement in the management&#x27;s decision-making process in return for forgoing overtime pay and agreeing to new, more efficient working practices that resulted in increased labour productivity.

The successful implementation of the new industrial relations strategy in 1983 made BCal employees the highest paid airline staff in the UK at the time.

=== A major shakeup ===
In 1984, the UK Government began to prepare then wholly state-owned BA for privatisation in earnest by appointing a new board of directors with several years&#x27; experience in private industry and by changing its legal status from a Crown Corporation to a public limited company. BCal&#x27;s senior management saw this as a major threat to the company&#x27;s continuing existence as the UK&#x27;s second largest international scheduled airline. According to BCal&#x27;s own calculations, the relevant figures for 1983 had shown that BA alone accounted for 83% of all UK scheduled airline capacity measured in tonne kilometers as opposed to a mere 13–14% for BCal. These figures also showed that BA carried seven-and-a-half times as many passengers as BCal, and that Heathrow&#x27;s share of international scheduled air traffic was five-and-a-half times greater than Gatwick&#x27;s (79% and 14% respectively). This meant that a privatised BA on this scale would enjoy far greater financial clout than BCal. It also meant that BA&#x27;s market power would be disproportionate compared with that of any other UK airline as a result of its much greater economies of scale. Furthermore, the Government&#x27;s decision to proceed with BA&#x27;s privatisation inevitably meant the end of the &quot;Second Force&quot; policy, which had guided BCal&#x27;s development since its inception. In addition, the transfer of BA&#x27;s ownership from the public to the private sector meant that BCal could no longer rely on the indirect protection Government ownership afforded it to prevent BA from abusing its power — for example, by engaging in anti-competitive behaviour against BCal.

To redress this competitive imbalance, BCal proposed to the Government the transfer of several of BA&#x27;s most lucrative long-haul routes to itself — including BA&#x27;s profitable Saudi Arabian routes as well as that airline&#x27;s routes to Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Harare, Islamabad, Kolkata, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing. BCal also proposed the transfer of BA&#x27;s short-/medium-haul routes from Heathrow to Vienna, Helsinki, Athens, Istanbul, Malta and Larnaca, which it wanted to serve from Gatwick, and the removal of capacity restrictions on its existing short-haul European routes from Gatwick. The airline furthermore proposed to take over BA&#x27;s services from Gatwick to the Iberian peninsula and that airline&#x27;s services from Gatwick to the Caribbean. Moreover, BCal wanted the Government to pursue additional opportunities for dual designation in its [re-]negotiations of existing and new bilateral air services agreements with foreign governments on its behalf — in particular, to the Far East and Australia as well as to East and South Africa and Canada at a later stage. BCal was prepared to pay BA between £200 million and £250 million for the routes to be transferred as well as for the associated staff and infrastructure. BCal estimated that it would require nine more aircraft — six long-haul and three short-haul planes — to operate the additional routes. It also reckoned that this would allow it to grow to the minimum size that was required to turn its Gatwick base into an efficient hub to enable it to prosper in the post-BA privatisation environment. BCal was furthermore of the opinion that this would allow it to increase its scheduled capacity to about 20% of all UK scheduled airline capacity while permitting BA to continue in its role as the dominant UK scheduled carrier, which would still have accounted for 70% of total scheduled capacity.

BCal&#x27;s senior management told the Government that the only alternatives to this proposal were shifting its existing scheduled operation from Gatwick to Heathrow&#x27;s then new Terminal 4, which it expected to produce an additional annual profit of at least £20 million in the first year itself, or to merge with BA. BCal&#x27;s senior management also told the Government that its preferred option was to remain at Gatwick and to strengthen its position there through the proposed route transfers to enable BCal to turn it into an efficient hub-and-spoke operation that would allow it to compete with BA and the giant US carriers on a level playing field. The airline&#x27;s senior management furthermore told the Government that a merger with BA was its least preferred option.

Lord King of Wartnaby, BA&#x27;s newly appointed chairman, infamously dismissed BCal&#x27;s offer to purchase BA&#x27;s assets for £200 million + as a &quot;smash-and-grab raid&quot;. He made it clear to the Government that he and his fellow board members opposed transferring any of these assets to BCal. Lord King also left the Government in no doubt that it would find itself in the embarrassing situation of having to dismiss the entire board if it imposed a route transfer to BCal against the BA board&#x27;s will.

In June 1984, BCal&#x27;s original proposal to share out BA&#x27;s routes ahead of the latter&#x27;s privatisation was followed up by a plan BCal had jointly formulated with eight other UK independent airlines. This plan sought to give the independents a greater share of the UK&#x27;s air transport market by reducing BA&#x27;s share. Measured in terms of capacity tonne kilometres (CTKs), it would have increased the independents&#x27; share from 17% to 40% while reducing BA&#x27;s share from 83% to 60%. For BCal alone this would have doubled its share from 15% to 30%. In their submission the independents claimed that privatising BA in its existing shape would allow it to dominate and destroy its competition. They also regarded BA&#x27;s continuing dominance as incompatible with the CAA&#x27;s goal of a less-regulated air transport market. BA countered the independents&#x27; contentions by maintaining that rather than benefiting consumers through increased competition, the independents&#x27; intent generally, and BCal&#x27;s in particular, would merely result in substituting its own services with those of other carriers.

The opposing views of Britain&#x27;s leading independent airlines on one hand and BA on the other regarding the future shape of the British air transport industry led to a review of the Government&#x27;s airline competition policy by the CAA. The result was &quot;CAP 500&quot;, a Government-commissioned White Paper in which the CAA outlined the findings of its review of existing UK airline competition policy. &quot;CAP 500&quot; also contained a number of recommendations that were designed to ensure that a competitive balance between BCal and the UK&#x27;s other independent airlines on one hand and a privatised BA on the other was maintained.

The CAA broadly endorsed BCal&#x27;s proposals by recommending the transfer of BA&#x27;s routes to Saudi Arabia and Harare as well as its Caribbean and Iberian peninsula routes to BCal. The CAA also recommended removing all capacity restrictions on BCal&#x27;s existing short-haul European routes. It furthermore advocated increasing the opportunities for designating BCal as the second UK flag carrier on additional long-haul routes where BA was the only UK scheduled airline. This was to be achieved through appropriate amendments to the relevant bilateral agreements.

Full implementation of &quot;CAP 500&quot; would have resulted in strengthening BCal&#x27;s position at Gatwick by making it the sole UK scheduled airline on all trunk routes from that airport while maintaining BA&#x27;s status as the dominant UK scheduled carrier at Heathrow.

In the event, under pressure from BA&#x27;s board and to ensure BA&#x27;s successful flotation, the Government decided not to accept the CAA&#x27;s recommendations in full. Instead, it settled on a limited route transfer from BA to BCal. This entailed transferring BA&#x27;s profitable Saudi Arabian routes to Dhahran and Jeddah to BCal to add to its new route to the Saudi capital Riyadh. The Government thought that this would strengthen BCal by making it the sole UK flag carrier to all of Saudi Arabia and that it would tie in well with BCal&#x27;s &quot;linking the oil capitals of the world&quot; corporate strategy, which it had successfully pursued since the late 1970s. To be seen as even-handed by both parties and to counter BA&#x27;s accusations of displaying favouritism towards BCal, the Government required BCal to hand over to BA its loss-making South American routes as well as its unused licences to serve a number of additional destinations in the US and Morocco.

The limited route transfer on which the Government had decided was far less ambitious than either BCal&#x27;s own proposals or the CAA&#x27;s recommendations and would still leave it far smaller than BA and the giant US carriers. Although this was less than it had bargained for, BCal&#x27;s senior management decided to accept the Government&#x27;s decision because they estimated the two Saudi Arabian routes BA was going to transfer to be worth £18 million in additional annual profits. This would be only £2 million less than what BCal expected to earn in extra yearly profits from its existing network had it been able to transfer its entire operation to Heathrow. Given these magnitudes and Heathrow&#x27;s already tight slot situation at peak times, BCal&#x27;s senior management considered this difference in annual profitability immaterial.

The route transfer was to take place at the start of the 1985 summer timetable period.

=== Reaching new heights ===

1984 was a record year for BCal. It ended the financial year to 31 October 1984 with a pre-tax profit of £17.1 million, which surpassed the record financial performance of 1978. This translated into a £10.9 million retained profit at group level. These profits were the result of improvements in the British economy, which had recovered from the severe recession of the early 1980s, and BCal beginning to reap the benefits of the new industrial relations strategy it had begun implementing the year before.

Also in 1984, BCal received two brand-new A310-200 widebodies at its Gatwick base.

In 1984, the CAA awarded BCal a licence to commence scheduled services from Gatwick to Riyadh and authorised the airline to operate dedicated scheduled services to Abu Dhabi, Doha, Dubai and Muscat, rather than serving these destinations as intermediate points only.

Libreville was added to the network during 1984. At the start of the summer timetable period, frequencies to Frankfurt and Geneva increased to three daily round-trips. Connectair and RFG joined the British Caledonian Commuter scheme adding new, regional feeder routes from Gatwick to Antwerp and Paderborn. Connectair also assumed the operation of BCal&#x27;s Gatwick—Brussels route. BCal furthermore decided to withdraw its Glasgow—Newcastle—Amsterdam regional service to focus its operations on providing worldwide scheduled services from London only.

BCal decided to retire the four ex-Laker One-Eleven 300s and to acquire another second-hand One-Eleven 500, giving it a total fleet strength of 13. Standardizing its short-haul, narrow-bodied fleet on the same aircraft sub-type enhanced its ability to interchange aircraft across that fleet. As part of a &quot;mid-life update&quot;, of its entire One-Eleven fleet, hush kits were fitted to comply with stricter, post-1985 noise abatement rules. This was to keep the One-Eleven effective until more modern aircraft were delivered in 1988.

1984 also marked the end of the long-haul, narrow-bodied era for BCal when the last Boeing 707 left its fleet.

1985 was the year that broke all previous financial records at BCal. The pre-tax profit in the financial year to 31 October 1985 reached an all-time high of £21.4 million. The retained group profit for that period was £11.3 million. The profit attributable to BCal&#x27;s airline operation represented an improvement of almost £12 million compared with the previous year&#x27;s results. During that year, BCal carried 8% more passengers and 20% more cargo compared with the year before.

The limited route transfer on which BCal had agreed with BA and the Government took effect at the start of the 1985 summer timetable period, when BCal commenced scheduled operations from Gatwick to Dhahran and Jeddah, replacing the BA service from Heathrow. At the same time, BCal relinquished its traffic rights to Recife, Salvador, Rio, São Paulo, San Juan, Caracas and Bogotá. BA acquired these traffic rights and began serving most of these destinations from Heathrow.

A second 747 wearing BCal&#x27;s full livery joined the fleet permitting the resumption of a daily service between Gatwick and New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) during the summer of 1985, after the airline&#x27;s absence from that route for over a decade. BCal&#x27;s 1985 re-launch of scheduled Gatwick—JFK services coincided with the introduction of its door-to-door limousine service for premium travellers.

The temporary lease of a Viscount sporting the full BCal livery for the duration of the 1985 summer timetable period enabled the airline to increase capacity on the Gatwick—Brussels route by replacing smaller aircraft Connectair had used to operate that service under the British Caledonian Commuter scheme and to add more capacity on week-ends on the busy Gatwick—Jersey route.

Two more, second-hand DC-10-30s were acquired to replace BCal&#x27;s A310s, which left the fleet when the additional DC-10s arrived.

1985 also saw the establishment of British Caledonian Flight Training, a new flight crew training facility.

As Gatwick became busier, BCal&#x27;s senior management called on the Government to ban all charter flights from the airport and to move those services to Stansted.

The Government decided to meet BCal&#x27;s request for a ban on all charter flights from Gatwick half-way by agreeing to give preference to scheduled services in all future slot allocations at the airport.

=== A new airline for Europe ===
The collapse of the oil price during the mid-1980s had serious repercussions for BCal&#x27;s revenue and profit projections as this impacted the oil-related business routes on which the airline had depended for most of its profits since the late 1970s. All of these routes carried fewer premium business travellers than anticipated. This in turn led to a sharp decline of those routes&#x27; profitability and, hence, their contribution to the airline&#x27;s overall profitability. In the case of the newly acquired Saudi Arabian routes this meant that they delivered less than half the projected profits.

The limited route transfer had allowed BCal to grow its scheduled capacity to about 18% of all UK scheduled airline capacity, while BA only suffered an insignificant reduction in its share of total scheduled capacity.

BCal&#x27;s 18% share was still far less than the minimum size BCal needed to acquire the economies of scale to compete with BA and the giant US carriers on a level playing field. This was also less than what had been envisaged in the Edwards report prior to BCal&#x27;s formation.

This situation was unsatisfactory for the airline and unrewarding for its shareholders.

Therefore, under pressure from its controlling shareholder 3i, the search for a new, long-term strategy began.

As a consequence of its main shareholder&#x27;s dissatisfaction, the British Caledonian Group&#x27;s board of directors established contact with ILG&#x27;s board in November 1985. The purpose of this meeting was to begin exploring ways of combining BCal&#x27;s and Air Europe&#x27;s separate short-haul operations in a new joint venture that would have enabled both airlines to acquire the economies of scale to compete with a privatised BA on a level playing field. Another objective of this exercise was to smooth out each other&#x27;s peaks and troughs, for BCal&#x27;s peaks occurred during week days while Air Europe&#x27;s occurred on week-ends. This meant that both airlines could offer their spare capacities to each other to achieve an overall higher level of equipment utilisation and higher load factors throughout the week. ILG&#x27;s dominant position in the inclusive tour market would also have helped BCal to significantly increase its generally low short-haul loads by filling seats that would otherwise remain empty with ILG&#x27;s clients, especially on week-ends. A series of meetings ensued. The result was a 150-page study entitled &quot;An Airline for Europe&quot;. It envisaged the commencement of joint scheduled operations from Gatwick to Hamburg, Munich, Düsseldorf, Milan Linate and Nice in 1987. The next stage of development was to occur during the 1988/89 winter timetable period when further routes linking Gatwick with Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna, Rome and Athens were to be added. The study also envisaged adding services from Gatwick to Zürich, Dublin, Madrid and Lisbon at a later stage to enable the joint venture to acquire sufficient economies of scale to become a viable entity in the long term. However, it recognised that it might be difficult to implement the last stage of the envisaged expansion as the relevant routes had already been licensed to Dan-Air.

The study also made profit projections for each stage of the envisaged joint venture&#x27;s development.

These were:

* £3.7 million for 1987/88.
* £5.5 million for 1988/89.
* £25.2 million for 1989/90.

The latter represented a return on total equity employed plus previously retained earnings of 18.2%. This was substantially better than BCal&#x27;s short-haul operation could have hoped to achieve on its own.

Despite several rounds of talks being held that lasted well into the first half of 1986, both sides eventually decided not to proceed further with their joint venture study and to go their separate ways.

=== Unexpected reversal of fortunes ===
BCal had high hopes for 1986. It expected to make record profits representing a substantial improvement on the previous year&#x27;s pre-tax profits of £21.4 million. The British Caledonian Group expected its turnover to exceed half-a-billion pounds while BCal expected to carry just under two-and-a-half million passengers. The year&#x27;s crowning glory was to be the flotation of the British Caledonian Group on the London Stock Exchange.

Instead, 1986 turned out to be BCal&#x27;s &quot;annus horribilis&quot; during which it faced its most acute crisis as a result of events beyond its control. The airline was never going to recover from this crisis, which ultimately sealed the company&#x27;s fate.

The events that brought about a dramatic turn-around in BCal&#x27;s fortunes plunging it into a £19.3 million pre-tax loss (translated into a £14.4 million retained group loss). included

* the American bombings of Libya during April 1986 in retaliation for that country&#x27;s (at the time) alleged involvement in the bombing of &quot;La Belle&quot; nightclub in West Berlin, which injured over 200 and killed three.
* the world&#x27;s worst nuclear accident in Chernobyl in the then Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 26 April 1986
* the adverse impact of the devaluation of the Nigerian currency on BCal&#x27;s earnings from passenger and freight bookings originating in Nigeria and paid for in the local currency, which the Nigerian government of the day prevented from being repatriated to the UK.

The first two events almost emptied the cabins of BCal&#x27;s widebodied planes plying the transatlantic routes linking Gatwick with Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Atlanta, New York JFK and Los Angeles because of a sudden surge in cancellations, especially from passengers based in the US. Many of BCal&#x27;s American passengers cancelled or postponed their trips at that time because they feared retaliatory attacks by Libyan secret service agents and did not want to risk exposing themselves to the radioactive fallout from the Ukrainian nuclear catastrophe while conducting their business or spending their holidays in Europe. At the time, BCal&#x27;s transatlantic scheduled services accounted for a quarter of the airline&#x27;s worldwide revenues and 37% of its passenger traffic. The Libyan bombings also dashed any hopes BCal had to resume operations on its profitable Gatwick—Tripoli route later that year, resulting in a further loss of expected revenues and profits.

The third had a serious impact on BCal&#x27;s finances at a time of crisis as it denied the airline speedy access to a substantial amount of money derived from passenger and cargo sales in its most important and most profitable overseas market. This resulted in a significant revenue loss.

What was already a bad situation for the airline was made worse by the continuing decline of the oil price, which had started the year before. The rapid fall in the oil price reduced the oil industry&#x27;s spending power, thereby significantly reducing the number of oil-related business passengers planning to fly with BCal in future. As these passengers used to account for a major share of the airline&#x27;s high-yield premium bookings, future revenue and profit projections needed to be revised as well to take account of much reduced demand for the company&#x27;s most expensive tickets.

In addition, the Government announced the withdrawal of BCal&#x27;s licence to operate the high-frequency &quot;Gatwick—Heathrow Airlink&quot; helicopter shuttle service as a result of the completion of the M25 London orbital motorway, thereby denying the airline&#x27;s passengers easy access to connecting flights from Heathrow and depriving passengers travelling with airlines based at that airport of the opportunity to avail themselves of convenient onward connections from Gatwick. The resulting reduction in the number of passengers changing flights at BCal&#x27;s Gatwick base had a detrimental effect on load factors on the airline&#x27;s profitable long-haul routes. This in turn reduced the profitability of these routes, as well as the airline&#x27;s overall profitability by an estimated £2 million per annum.

As a result of the problems it was facing during that time, BCal announced 1,000 job losses out of a total worldwide workforce of 7,700 which given there was no overall reduction in services &quot;Flight International&quot; described as suggesting &quot;that the slim down was overdue&quot; It also needed to make adjustments to its schedule to take account of the expected changes in traffic patterns. This led to an immediate reduction in the number of weekly frequencies on BCal&#x27;s underperforming Saudi Arabian routes. The aircraft capacity released was redeployed on BCal&#x27;s well-performing route to Dubai and Hong Kong.

Altogether BCal suffered a total revenue loss of £80 million while the airline itself lost two-and-a-half million pounds every month at that time.

The airline embarked upon a major asset disposal programme to compensate for this significant revenue loss and to have sufficient funds to keep the business running. These asset disposals included the profitable sale of two, relatively young McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodied aircraft to Continental Airlines, the sale and lease-back of the entire 13-strong, short-haul BAC One-Eleven fleet, the sale of six of Caledonian Hotel Holdings&#x27; hotels, the sale of Caledonian Airmotive to US-based Ryder Systems, the sale of Caledonian Leisure Holdings and the disposal of British Caledonian Helicopters the following year.

Despite facing a major crisis, BCal continued adding new aircraft, routes and flight frequencies in an effort to maintain a competitive operation.

Two more 747s joined the fleet during 1986. This permitted a major capacity increase on the popular Gatwick—Dubai—Hong Kong route.

During that year, Muscat, Gaborone and Aberdeen joined the network.

BCal&#x27;s acquisition of a fifth 747 the following year permitted the launch of a new route from Gatwick to Tokyo on 31 May 1987, at a frequency of three return flights per week. In addition, for the first time in five years, two new European routes were launched from Gatwick. These served Milan Linate and Nice at a frequency of 13 and three return flights per week, respectively.

=== Merger discussions ===
By July 1987, BCal had already exhausted most of the proceeds from the asset disposal programme.

The proceeds from the sale of two DC-10s to Continental Airlines was all that was left to keep the airline in business. Senior management realised that the company was unlikely to survive on its own and that it needed to act fast if it wanted to avoid BCal&#x27;s collapse.

Therefore, the search for a financially strong partner acquired a renewed sense of urgency.

Several rounds of talks that were aimed at achieving a full-scale merger ensued with various airlines in the UK, the US, Canada and Europe.

BCal&#x27;s future prospects as a stand-alone, medium-sized airline operating a variety of short-, medium- and long-haul scheduled services were rapidly diminishing against a background of looming consolidation in the airline industry. This was driven by the giant US carriers that had begun channeling their traffic flows into powerful hub-and-spoke operations, rather than feeding these into the networks of BCal and other international partner airlines, in the wake of US deregulation. In addition, BA&#x27;s impending privatisation and the Government&#x27;s refusal to fully implement the recommendations contained in the CAA&#x27;s airline competition White Paper meant that BCal was unable to acquire the economies of scale it needed to compete with these airlines on a level playing field. This prevented BCal from achieving higher volumes over which to spread its fixed costs. It also deprived the airline of the capacity to generate the funds to continue investing in fleet renewal, further network expansion and new information technology systems.

BCal&#x27;s basic dilemma at the time can be summed up as follows:

It had become a mid-sized airline that was too big to be a specialist, niche operator. Yet it was too small to effectively compete with BA and the US giants in terms of economies of scale and scope. At the same time, it was unable to match the significantly lower costs of emerging, aggressively expanding Far East competitors, such as Cathay Pacific.

BCal&#x27;s precarious financial position made it obvious for most of its rivals and seasoned industry observers that the ailing airline lacked the financial strength to survive on its own for much longer.

BCal had valuable traffic rights to operate scheduled services on a number of lucrative, long-haul routes to parts of the world that were not served by any other British airline at that time. It therefore became a desirable takeover target and a bidding war ensued between several potential suitors.

The chief protagonists in this takeover battle were BCal&#x27;s archrival BA as well as ILG/Air Europe and SAS.

=== Proposed BA-BCal merger ===
On 16 July 1987, Sir Adam Thomson and Lord King of Wartnaby, chairmen of British Caledonian Group and British Airways respectively, surprisingly announced at a press conference the intention of the latter to acquire the former in an agreed £237 million bid. They had agreed on this deal only the day before. Officially this was presented as a &quot;merger between equals&quot; but within the industry it was widely acknowledged as a mutually agreed rescue deal to avoid the collapse of BCal. In addition, BA, which had been privatised only in February of that year, was keen to get hold of its main home-grown competitor&#x27;s most valuable assets. These included BCal&#x27;s lucrative traffic rights to those parts of the world BA could not serve itself as a result of the now defunct &quot;Second Force&quot; policy. This itself had resulted in a &quot;spheres of influence&quot; policy for BA and BCal that had prevented both airlines from competing with each other on a number of important long-haul routes. BA also saw this as a necessary move to fill the gaps in its global route map to acquire the economies of scale that would permit it to compete against the giant US carriers on a level-playing field. BCal&#x27;s financial difficulties furthermore presented an opportunity for BA to forestall any competitive threat a revitalised BCal could pose to it in future, either on its own or in alliance with another airline. It therefore wanted to get hold of these assets before any competitor could lay its hands on them. Moreover, BA wanted to prevent BCal&#x27;s assets from passing into the hands of any [partially] foreign-owned or controlled competitors. It felt that under such a scenario the long-term competitiveness of the entire UK air transport industry was threatened.

=== ILG/Air Europe&#x27;s unsolicited counter bid ===
Following Sir Adam&#x27;s outright rejection of ILG chairman Harry Goodman&#x27;s offer to purchase BCal&#x27;s short-haul operation, and to merge that operation with the short-haul operations of ILG subsidiary Air Europe in return for not having the proposed BA-BCal deal referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), ILG decided at the end of July 1987 to launch a counter bid for the entire British Caledonian Group.

Air Europe was concerned that a new entity combining BA and BCal had the power to destroy the UK&#x27;s remaining independent airlines, especially with regard to their ability to compete with such a behemoth. At the time, Air Europe had ambitions of its own to become a major short-haul scheduled operator. It was planning to launch 11 new routes from Gatwick to Europe, thereby replacing and enhancing the services BCal had provided. Given a combined BA-BCal&#x27;s superior financial strength, considerably lower borrowing costs and far greater economies of scale, Air Europe&#x27;s management felt that it would be imprudent to launch these new routes if it had to compete with BA out of Heathrow and Gatwick as well. Therefore, its parent ILG had decided to make a counter bid, which it hoped would either kill off BA&#x27;s proposal to take over BCal lock, stock and barrel or result in it being referred to the MMC.

To enhance its credibility as a serious contender, Air Europe&#x27;s bid contained a detailed proposal to return BCal to profitability by way of a reorganisation. This proposal had been prepared by a retired BA head of route planning whom ILG had specifically hired for this purpose. BCal would be split into four discrete businesses, each of which with its own management accountable for the performance of that unit. The businesses would be a long-haul operation under the BCal brand, a short-haul operation merged with Air Europe&#x27;s existing short-haul operation using the BCal brand on business routes and the Air Europe brand in leisure markets, and an engineering and a ground handling unit.

The long-haul operation was to be re-equipped with a brand-new fleet comprising six Boeing 747-400s and 10 Boeing 767-300ERs to achieve a substantial reduction in operating costs and to permit an increase in frequencies. There were to be fewer services to Africa — where the new management wanted to keep only the really profitable routes to Nigeria and Ghana — while a second daily service to New York JFK was to be launched, Dubai was to be de-linked from the Hong Kong service and Hong Kong was to be served non-stop with the new 747-400s. In addition, there were to be more flights to the Middle East making use of unused licences to serve additional destinations in the region, which BCal had obtained during the early 1980s. There was also a plan to apply for traffic rights to serve other destinations in the Far East non-stop from Gatwick in competition with BA&#x27;s existing services from Heathrow. This combination of more non-stop flights and higher frequencies to prime long-haul destinations would have resulted in a more attractive product for high-yield business travellers, thereby enabling the revamped BCal to become profitable again within a short period of time.

The short-haul operation was to have brand-new aircraft as well, which would have resulted in replacing BCal&#x27;s ageing BAC One-Eleven 500s with the new Boeing 737-300s Air Europe had on order. It would also have resulted in adopting the Air Europe short-haul inflight product.

BCal&#x27;s senior management rejected ILG&#x27;s bid. They felt that both airlines&#x27; nature of operations and their business strategies were incompatible and that therefore there were no synergies to be gained from combining BCal with what was in their opinion &quot;essentially a charter company&quot;.

=== Other contenders ===
The October 1987 stock market crash and ILG&#x27;s successful referral of the original BA-BCal merger proposal to the MMC resulted in BA tabling a revised bid to take over BCal. The fall in BA&#x27;s stock value left BA&#x27;s original offer worth £156.7 million and a condition of MMC approval was that BCal had to give up some routes reducing its value to BA. BA&#x27;s materially inferior offer to buy out the shareholders of the British Caledonian Group led to BCal&#x27;s senior management turn against BA and to recommend to their shareholders not to accept the revised bid. Instead, with the backing of BCal&#x27;s controlling shareholder 3i, a desperate search for a &quot;white knight&quot;, who was prepared to pay the same amount of money BA had offered to pay in its original bid, began.

Talks with British Midland, UTA and SAS ensued. Among these sets of talks the one with SAS seemed to be the most promising.

Had parallel talks to merge with UTA, at the time the largest wholly private airline in France and the closest French equivalent to a &quot;Second Force&quot;, succeeded, this would have resulted in a near perfect fit of both airlines&#x27; long-haul networks as these were largely complementary. It would also have given UTA, an exclusively long-haul carrier at the time, access to BCal&#x27;s short-haul network. This could have delivered additional passengers transferring at UTA&#x27;s Paris Charles de Gaulle base between that airline&#x27;s long-haul services and BCal&#x27;s short-haul feeder flights from/to London Gatwick. However, at the time the French authorities were thought to disapprove of establishing an equity link between any of their airlines and a foreign carrier.

Parallel talks with British Midland, which wanted to transfer all of BCal&#x27;s scheduled services from Gatwick to Heathrow, ended without result at an early stage because BCal&#x27;s senior management felt that this was not feasible given the tight slot situation at London&#x27;s premier airport.

BCal maintained that it had held several rounds of exploratory talks concerning the airline&#x27;s potential takeover with a number of US carriers that were willing to pay a substantial premium over BA&#x27;s original bid to acquire BCal. These talks had come to nothing because the US carriers feared that there were insurmountable regulatory obstacles to such a cross-border acquisition in the highly regulated airline industry.

=== SAS&#x27;s emergence as a potential &quot;white knight&quot; ===
SAS was prepared to offer £110 million for 26% of the British Caledonian Group&#x27;s stock, valuing the entire group at £400 million. Jan Carlzon, the then chairman of the SAS group, was well aware that so-called &quot;nationality clauses&quot; in most bilateral air services agreements and most countries&#x27; legal framework regulating the ownership of their airlines would restrict SAS&#x27;s direct involvement in BCal&#x27;s finances to acquiring a minority stake in its holding company. SAS therefore dispatched a team of executives headed by Jan Carlzon to the UK to work out details of a joint bid. This envisaged setting up an employee trust fund that would hold the same percentage of British Caledonian Group stock on behalf of the group&#x27;s employees as SAS itself was seeking to acquire, so as to be compliant with any rules limiting the stakes foreign individuals or entities could own in a British airline. They were prepared to extend a loan to the trustees of the envisaged employee trust fund to enable them to acquire an equal number of shares on the employees&#x27; behalf. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank that worked on SAS&#x27;s bid for 26% of the British Caledonian Group&#x27;s common stock, proposed this to be structured as a so-called &quot;exploding share&quot;. This would have enabled SAS to increase its holding in British Caledonian Group plc to a maximum of 40% through subsequent acquisition of additional non-voting shares. These in turn would have become ordinary shares following greater market liberalisation. The SAS executives discussed these ideas with BCal&#x27;s senior management and the unions representing its staff at the British Caledonian Group&#x27;s Crawley headquarters as well as with Government officials in London.

SAS faced a barrage of hostile propaganda and delaying tactics from BA that were designed to stall any third party&#x27;s competing bid to acquire BCal for as long as possible and got a mixed response to its planned counter bid for BCal from various departments of the UK Government.

To counter these negative sentiments, SAS&#x27;s proposals also included a plan to offer Dan-Air to participate in its merger with BCal by merging its scheduled services division with the new airline combine&#x27;s scheduled operation, thereby strengthening its position at Gatwick and the airport as a hub.

SAS&#x27;s rationale for launching a counter bid for BCal was the airline&#x27;s desire not to be left behind in the then widely expected scramble for consolidation in the airline industry by becoming part of one of the four or five global airline groupings that were predicted to dominate the entire industry.

SAS thought that BCal&#x27;s Gatwick base would give it access to a centrally located hub in the world&#x27;s biggest international air travel market, thereby helping it to overcome its geographic isolation on the margins of Northern Europe. It also thought that BCal&#x27;s lucrative long-haul routes from Gatwick to Africa and the Middle East would give it access to markets it could not profitably serve itself from relatively sparsely populated Scandinavia, and that this would make a good fit with its short-haul European routes — especially its comprehensive schedule to the UK from Scandinavia. SAS furthermore thought that by agreeing to transfer these services from Heathrow to Gatwick, it could also help solve BCal&#x27;s long-standing problem of not operating enough short-haul flights to improve its long-haul loads from Gatwick.

=== Takeover by British Airways ===
On 11 December, the CAA told SAS that it needed a British investor to match the SAS bid or the CAA would recommend to the Department of Trade and Industry that BCal no longer qualified as a British airline and the trade secretary indicated to the House of Commons that in that case he would be likely to revoke BCal&#x27;s licences.

To counter SAS proposals, BA made an alternative cash offer of £200 million for all of BCal&#x27;s stock (equivalent to 972 pence per share) while also leaving the alternative of 80 million BA shares still open.

Faced with the prospect of its takeover target being snatched away from under its nose by SAS, British Airways initially began resorting to bullying tactics. In this it had the implicit backing of Lord Tebbit, then a prominent cabinet member of Britain&#x27;s ruling Conservative Party, who publicly referred to SAS as &quot;Viking raiders&quot;.

BA was using a mix of rational and emotive arguments to convince both the regulators and the shareholders of the British Caledonian Group that its revised offer was in their best, long-term interest.

At the time, SAS used to pursue a high-fares-high-yield strategy in its Danish, Norwegian and Swedish home markets. BA argued that the SAS bid for BCal would lead to higher fares and thus would not benefit British consumers. In addition, BA also argued that BCal&#x27;s takeover by SAS, in which the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden jointly held a 50% stake at that time, effectively represented a back-door nationalisation of a significant part of Britain&#x27;s privatised air transport industry and contrasted this with its own, recent privatisation. In this context, BA highlighted that two of these governments represented countries — Norway and Sweden — that were not even members of the European Economic Community (EEC) at that time and therefore were not bound by moves to liberalise its member states&#x27; air transport markets. BA furthermore argued that this would call into question BCal&#x27;s international traffic rights as most bilateral air services agreements contained a clause demanding airlines to be substantially owned and controlled by interests based in the countries they represented, and went on to argue that this could force the British Government to make concessions to its overseas counterparts that were not in the interest of the British air transport industry to preserve BCal&#x27;s UK flag carrier status. BA moreover backed up its arguments with the threat that it would immediately apply to the CAA to have all of BCal&#x27;s licences to operate scheduled air services revoked. BA based these threats on a clause in the 1982 Civil Aviation Act, which states that any airline claiming UK flag carrier status must be substantially owned and controlled by individuals who are UK nationals or entities whose headquarters are located in the UK.

In the event, the British Caledonian Group&#x27;s controlling shareholder 3i decided to accept BA&#x27;s final £250 million offer which it presented on 21 December 1987 with the proviso that it needed to be accepted or rejected that day. As the uncertainty surrounding BCal&#x27;s future led to a further, significant deterioration of its financial position and BA&#x27;s final bid trumped SAS, the fiduciary responsibilities of the British Caledonian Group&#x27;s board towards their shareholders meant that the only option left was to recommend the acceptance of the BA bid. 3i and the other shareholders decided to sell their stakes in British Caledonian Group plc to British Airways relinquishing control of BCal.

Following BA&#x27;s successful takeover of BCal, SAS had a giant hoarding erected at the entrance to Heathrow&#x27;s central area featuring an advertisement that ended with BCal&#x27;s famous 1980s marketing slogan &quot;we never forget you have a choice&quot;.

The referral of BA&#x27;s original bid to take over the entire British Caledonian Group to the MMC had resulted in the imposition of several conditions before the proposed deal was allowed to go ahead. These included BA releasing a minimum of 5,000 annual slots BCal had held at Gatwick to competitors and requiring it to surrender to the CAA several of BCal&#x27;s licences to operate scheduled services from Gatwick on a number of important, short-haul feeder routes. Although BA had been permitted to re-apply for these licences, the CAA decided to re-allocate all of them to rival airlines.

BA also needed to withdraw the objections to Air Europe&#x27;s application to the CAA for licences to launch new scheduled services on several short-haul routes BCal already used to serve from Gatwick.

Furthermore, both companies&#x27; combined turnover exceeded the minimum threshold that automatically triggers the referral of a proposed merger between two or more companies that conduct a significant part or all of their business in EU member states to the European competition authorities in Brussels. Therefore, the Competition Directorate of the European Commission (EC) needed to clear BA&#x27;s takeover of BCal as well.

In addition to the conditions imposed by the MMC, BA agreed further concessions with the EC&#x27;s Competition Directorate to prevent BA from abusing its dominant position at both of London&#x27;s main airports. These included limiting BA&#x27;s presence at Gatwick to a maximum of 25% of all available slots, relinquishing BCal&#x27;s unused route licences and to not oppose Air Europe&#x27;s designation as an additional UK flag carrier on Gatwick—Rome. BA also had to give a legally binding undertaking that it would not seek to increase its share of Gatwick slots above 25% through any additional acquisitions of other airlines and/or their slots until 1992. These measures were primarily intended as safeguards for other airlines that required access to a sufficient number of attractive slots at Gatwick to launch viable scheduled services in competition with BA. Otherwise, BA&#x27;s dominant position at both of London&#x27;s main airports would have made it virtually impossible for the much smaller independents to replace and enhance capacity lost as a result of BCal&#x27;s takeover, especially on routes where BCal had competed with BA and which accounted for more than half of its net revenue earned from scheduled services.

Air UK was awarded the licences for BCal&#x27;s former London—Scotland trunk routes from Gatwick to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Dan-Air obtained the licences for the old BCal routes from Gatwick to Manchester and Aberdeen as well as from Gatwick to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Nice. The licence for BCal&#x27;s Gatwick—Brussels route was transferred to Air Europe. The CAA also granted Air Europe permission to increase the frequency on its existing route between Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle, where it had already competed with BCal, so that it could match Dan-Air&#x27;s frequency. Both Air Europe and Connectair were successful in their applications for BCal&#x27;s unused European route licences.

BA continued serving the routes until the new licence holders were ready to assume operations at the start of the 1988/89 winter timetable period.

BCal ceased to exist as a legal entity at 00.01 hrs. on 14 April 1988.

Cal Air International, the former British Caledonian Charter operation, and British Caledonian Flight Training were not included in BA&#x27;s acquisition of the British Caledonian Group.

British Airtours, BA&#x27;s wholly owned, Gatwick-based charter subsidiary, was rebranded &quot;Caledonian Airways&quot;. The aircraft were repainted in a variation of BA livery with BCal&#x27;s lion rampant on the aircraft fins and cabin crew members taking to wearing the tartan.

BA replaced the former BCal short-haul fleet of 13 BAC One-Eleven 500s with 14 Boeing 737-200 Advanced.

The One-Elevens were transferred to BA&#x27;s regional bases in Birmingham and Manchester.

The five second-hand 747s BA had inherited from BCal were replaced with its own 747-100/200s.

In addition, BA stationed three Lockheed L-1011 Tristar widebodied aircraft at Gatwick, which were used to operate the former BCal West African coastal schedule as well as a number of new routes to North Africa and the Middle East that had been transferred to Gatwick from Heathrow.

The only former BCal aircraft BA kept for its Gatwick operation were eight McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s that had formed BA&#x27;s erstwhile competitor&#x27;s core long-haul fleet.

BA transferred the former BCal routes to Tokyo and Saudi Arabia to Heathrow. To compensate for this loss and to utilise its full slot allocation at Gatwick, BA moved its routes to Amman, Bermuda, Cairo, Khartoum, Larnaca, Luxor and Nassau to Gatwick, and routed a new Manchester—London—Islamabad service via Gatwick instead of Heathrow.

BA transferred all of its international operations from Gatwick — including those it had inherited from BCal — to the then brand-new North Terminal, which opened in March 1988.

The A320s BCal had ordered in 1983 began arriving at BA&#x27;s new Gatwick base during the spring of 1988. These aircraft had been painted in BA&#x27;s contemporary Landor Associates designed livery. BA operated its first commercial A320 service between London Gatwick and Geneva before transferring the entire A320 fleet to its main base at Heathrow later that year.

==Reasons for the failure of British Caledonian==
== British Caledonian Commuter Services ==

To further improve its network connectivity and to transform Gatwick into a US-style airline hub, BCal established a dedicated commuter services network under the &quot;British Caledonian Commuter Services&quot; brand at the start of the 1982–83 winter timetable period. BCal&#x27;s commuter network was modelled on the Allegheny Airlines commuter system, the first dedicated commuter operation in the world launched in 1967.

The first airline to join the British Caledonian Commuter scheme in 1982 was Humberside Airport-based Genair.

Genair, which had been formed as a Manchester-based executive charter airline in November 1980, commenced operations with a single Beech King Air E90. Following its move to Liverpool in February 1981, in June of that year, it acquired an 18-seater Embraer Bandeirante and began regional scheduled services to Amsterdam and London Gatwick. Closer links with BCal, followed by Genair&#x27;s participation in the British Caledonian Commuter scheme and its subsequent relocation to Humberside in late 1982, resulted in acquisition of a small fleet of Short SD3-30 and Short SD3-60 commuter turboprop planes, which were [re-]painted in British Caledonian Commuter colours. Genair used these aircraft to replace Bandeirantes on Gatwick—Liverpool and launch new feeder routes linking BCal&#x27;s Gatwick base with Humberside, Norwich, Teesside, Leeds/Bradford, Bristol and Cardiff. All flights on these routes were operated under BCal flight numbers using the BR designator. Barbara Harmer, one of Genair&#x27;s SD3-30 pilots at the time, joined BCal in March 1984, where she first flew One-Elevens before transitioning to DC-10s. Harmer subsequently became the UK&#x27;s first and only female Concorde pilot following BCal&#x27;s takeover by BA.

Other airlines that joined the British Caledonian Commuter scheme at its inception included Brymon Airways and Guernsey Airlines. The former operated the feeder routes from Gatwick to Birmingham, East Midlands and Plymouth, while the CAA had transferred Air UK&#x27;s Gatwick—Guernsey licence to the latter following numerous passenger complaints about the service Air UK had previously provided since it had assumed the former BIA operation on that route.

==Incidents and accidents==
BCal had an enviable safety record during its 17-year existence. Its aircraft were never involved in fatal accidents.
There were a few noteworthy non-fatal incidents involving the airline&#x27;s aircraft.

* On 24 September 1971, a Vickers VC10 1103 (registration: G-ASIX) was hit by clear air turbulence (CAT) en route from Santiago de Chile to Buenos Aires while operating the first sector of BCal&#x27;s weekly Santiago–Gatwick schedule. While the aircraft was cruising above the Andes, it encountered CAT above the mountain peaks. This resulted in the aircraft being thrown up on to its side at a greater-than-90-degree angle, and then tossed, headlong, nose down, towards the up to high peaks just a few thousand feet (several hundred metres) below. The severity of this incident injured an air hostess who was working in the rear galley and knocked out the powered control units (PCUs) of almost every flight control surface, leaving the aircraft to plummet downwards at a speed approaching Mach 1. The crew managed a successful recovery and reset the aircraft&#x27;s PCUs. Following the aircraft&#x27;s safe landing at Buenos Aires, a thorough ground check was performed before the aircraft was allowed to resume its flight to Gatwick. A detailed inspection of the aircraft at Gatwick revealed a fracture in one of the tail fin support spars, necessitating a lengthy repair. On an airliner with wing-mounted engines under the same circumstances, the engine mounting pins would probably have snapped.
* On 28 January 1972, a Vickers VC10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) sustained severe structural damage to the fuselage as a result of an exceptionally hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow. The airline decided that repairs were not cost-effective and the aircraft was written off and scrapped at Gatwick in 1975.).
* On 19 July 1972, a BAC One-Eleven 501EX (registration: G-AWYS) sustained substantial damage as a result of aborting takeoff from Corfu Airport too late. The aircraft had passed through a pool of standing water close to its decision speed during the takeoff run. This caused a temporary reduction of engine thrust which the flight&#x27;s commander interpreted as engine failure requiring an immediate rejection of takeoff. The flight deck crew&#x27;s decision to abandon their takeoff was delayed and as a result, the aircraft did not stop on the runway but, after crossing some rough ground, finally came to rest in a -deep lagoon. None of the six crew members and 79 passengers was seriously injured in the crash, but an elderly female passenger collapsed after being helped from the aircraft and subsequently died of cardiac arrest on her way to hospital.

<text>Farewell, My Lovely is a novel by Raymond Chandler, published in 1940, the second novel he wrote featuring the Los Angeles private eye Philip Marlowe. It was adapted for the screen three times and was also adapted for the stage and radio.

==Plot==
Private detective Philip Marlowe is investigating a dead-end missing person case when he sees a felon, Moose Malloy, barging into a club called Florian&#x27;s, looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma Valento. The club has changed owners, so no one there now knows her. Malloy ends up killing the black owner of the club and escaping. The murder case is assigned to Lt. Nulty, a Bay City police detective who has no interest in the murder of a black man. Marlowe advises Nulty to look for Malloy&#x27;s girlfriend, but Nulty prefers to let Marlowe do the routine legwork and rely on finding Malloy based on his huge size and loud clothes. Marlowe decides to follow up and look for the girl.

Marlowe tracks down Mrs. Jessie Florian, the widow of the nightclub&#x27;s former owner, and plies her with bourbon. Mrs. Florian remembers Malloy&#x27;s girlfriend and tells Marlowe she is dead. He manages to get hold of a photo that&#x27;s signed, &quot;Always yours, Velma Valento&quot; and takes it with him. Before making further progress, Marlowe receives a call from a man named Lindsay Marriott, who claims his friend has been robbed and requests Marlowe&#x27;s presence in delivering a ransom payment for a stolen necklace. Later that evening, in a deserted canyon, Marlowe waits in the dark and is hit on the head from behind. When he awakes, Marriott is dead. A passerby, Anne Riordan, finds him and takes him home.

Lt. Randall, the cunning but honest Los Angeles cop investigating Marriott&#x27;s murder, is skeptical about the story. At Marlowe&#x27;s office, Anne explains that she is from Bay City, a policeman&#x27;s daughter interested in local crime. Anne&#x27;s father was cashiered by the corrupt cops running the Bay City police. She tells Marlowe that she learned from Randall that the necklace belongs to a Mrs. Lewin Lockridge Grayle, the young wife of a wealthy and influential Bay City resident. Mrs. Grayle is a ravishing blonde whom Grayle met when she was singing for the radio station he owned. She married him in Europe under an assumed name to keep her background secret. Anne offers to have her hire Marlowe to find the necklace.

Marlowe examines some marijuana cigarettes he found on Marriott&#x27;s body and discovers the card of a psychic, Jules Amthor. He makes an appointment to see him. On a hunch, he investigates Mrs. Florian&#x27;s house and discovers that Marriott held a trust deed on it, meaning he could foreclose on her at will. Following up with Mrs. Florian, she reveals she was once a servant for Marriott&#x27;s family, and Marlowe suspects she was somehow blackmailing him. Marlowe visits Mrs. Grayle, who finds him attractive and hires him, which he can use as an excuse to continue investigating the two murders. They make a date to meet again at the club of a local hoodlum, Laird Brunette, near the spot where Marriott was killed.

At Amthor&#x27;s office, Marlowe probes him for his connection to Marriott and the drugs. Amthor summons a pair of Bay City detectives out of their jurisdiction to arrest Marlowe, claiming Marlowe tried to blackmail him. Instead of taking him to jail, the detectives knock Marlowe unconscious and lock him up in a private hospital run by Dr. Sonderborg, a drug dealer who keeps him docile with drug injections. Marlowe escapes, but on the way out, he sees Malloy in another room. He discusses the case with Randall, who is annoyed at his persistence in investigating. They suspect Marriott of blackmailing wealthy women, in league with Amthor. They return to Mrs. Florian&#x27;s home only to find her murdered, apparently shaken to death by Malloy.

Because of the involvement of the Bay City cops whom Amthor called in, Marlowe visits the corrupt police chief, John Wax, who brushes him off until Marlowe mentions that he has been hired by Mrs. Grayle. Marlowe is then told that Malloy may be hiding out on a gambling boat anchored beyond the three-mile limit and run by Brunette, who also controls the corrupt Bay City government. Marlowe sneaks on board with the help of Red Norgaard, another honest cop fired by Bay City, and despite being caught by Brunette, persuades him to pass a message through his criminal network to Malloy.

Marlowe calls Mrs. Grayle, ostensibly to have her pick him up at his apartment for their date. Responding to his message, Malloy shows up first and hides when Mrs. Grayle arrives. Marlowe confronts her: she is Velma Valento and had used Marriott to keep Mrs. Florian in line after she recognized Velma&#x27;s voice on Grayle&#x27;s radio station. Marriott had worked as an announcer at the same station. Mrs. Grayle convinced Marriott to set up Marlowe to be killed in the canyon, but actually did so to kill Marriott because she viewed him as a &quot;weak link&quot; who would reveal her secret past. She had also informed on Malloy about the robbery that sent him to prison. When Malloy hears this, he steps out to confront Velma, who shoots him fatally and flees. 

Amthor, Sonderborg and the crooked cops are all exposed; Red gets his job back. Velma flees, but when she is eventually tracked down in Baltimore, she kills the detective who recognizes her and commits suicide when cornered.

== Background ==
Chandler worked on the book from June to December 1939, before destroying the entire typescript and starting again. He completed the novel in the spring of 1940. &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, like many of Chandler&#x27;s novels, was written by what he called cannibalising previous short stories—taking short stories and altering them to fit together as a novel. This practice is sometimes known as a fix-up. In this case the three stories were &quot;Try the Girl&quot;, &quot;Mandarin&#x27;s Jade&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Liked Dogs&quot;.

&quot;Try the Girl&quot; provided the initial story about a hoodlum looking for his old girlfriend who has moved on to a more respectable life. &quot;Mandarin&#x27;s Jade&quot; was the basis for the middle sections about a jewel theft which may or may not have happened, the murder of a blackmailer and a corrupt psychic who works with a crime ring. &quot;The Man Who Liked Dogs&quot; provided the final part, where the detective is looking for a criminal and his search ultimately takes him to a gambling boat anchored off the Santa Monica coast, out of reach of the local law.

In the short stories, the criminals and motives are clearly explained by the end. As Chandler adapted and integrated the stories—which were originally written independently—he cared more about the style of writing and the characters than about making sure every plot point fitted together with consistency and lucidity. As he said of his work, &quot;my whole career is based on the idea that the formula doesn&#x27;t matter, the thing that counts is what you do with the formula; that is to say, it is a matter of style&quot;. Chandler used this writing style to develop his themes of corruption, social decay, cynicism and fatalism.

Chandler used recognizable locations in Los Angeles as settings but he created the fictional town of Bay City as a stand-in for Santa Monica, known for its widespread corruption in city government during the Great Depression. The title of the novel is apparently a reference to a song in the 1935 musical revue &quot;At Home Abroad&quot;.

==Film adaptations==
&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; was the first Philip Marlowe novel to be filmed. In 1942, &quot;The Falcon Takes Over&quot;, a 65-minute film that was the third in the &quot;Falcon&quot; series about Michael Arlen&#x27;s gentleman sleuth Gay Lawrence (played by George Sanders), used the plot of &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;. In 1944, Dick Powell played the part of the hard-boiled detective, named Philip Marlowe this time, in a classic film noir release—alternatively titled &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (in the United States) and &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (in the UK)—two years before cinema-goers saw Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946). In 1975, Robert Mitchum starred in a remake of &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;.

Although not technically an adaptation, the &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; episode of the television series &quot;The New Mike Hammer&quot; (aired 26 November 1986 on CBS) borrowed major plot details from the novel&#x27;s story of the search by a huge ex-con for his former girlfriend and criminal partner, including the fight in the bar and someone deliberately identifying a photo incorrectly and then being killed.

==Radio adaptations==
The novel was adapted on BBC Radio 4 by Bill Morrison, directed by John Tydeman and broadcast on 22 September 1988, starring Ed Bishop as Marlowe. BBC Radio 4, as part of its Classic Chandler series, also broadcast on 19 February 2011 a dramatic adaptation by Robin Brooks, with Toby Stephens as the hardboiled detective. It was adapted in a condensed form under the title of &quot;Murder My Sweet&quot; on &quot;Hollywood Star Time&quot;, broadcast on 8 June 1946, starring Dick Powell.

==Cultural references==
In the first shot after the opening titles of &quot;Get Carter&quot;, the character played by Michael Caine is seen reading a paperback copy of the book.

In the opening episode of the television series &quot;Bored to Death&quot;, the character Jonathan Ames, played by Jason Schwartzman, is inspired to become a private detective after reading the book.

<text>Claydon House is a country house in the Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire, England, near the village of Middle Claydon. It was built between 1757 and 1771 and is now owned by the National Trust.

The house is a listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and its gardens are listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==
Claydon has been the ancestral home of the Verney family since 1620. The church of All Saints, Middle Claydon lies less than from the house and contains many memorials to the Verney family: among them Sir Edmund Verney, who was chief standard bearer to Charles I during the English Civil War. Sir Edmund was slain at the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642, defending the standard. His ghost is reputed to haunt the house. In 1661, following the Restoration of the Monarchy, Sir Edmund&#x27;s son (Sir Ralph Verney) was awarded a baronetcy by Charles II for his and his father&#x27;s loyalty and bravery during the preceding period of unrest. Sir Ralph&#x27;s second surviving son and heir, John Verney was later, in 1703, made Viscount Fermanagh and his son was Ralph Verney, in 1743, was created Earl Verney.

There is believed to have been a house on the site from at least the 1400s. The manor of Middle Claydon was purchased by Sir Ralph Verney, Lord Mayor of London, in 1463. However, the land was immediately leased to Sir Roger Giffard and the first recording of the house on site describes the Tudor brick H-shaped manor house of the Giffards in 1539. Sir Edmund Verney the Standard Bearer redeemed the leased in 1620 and it became the principal country seat of the Verneys from that point onwards. The house received some modifications in the seventeenth century, particularly in 1654 when Sir Ralph Verney, 1st Bt, returned from his political exile and began to rebuild the family fortune after the Civil War. The house was virtually rebuilt starting in 1757 by Ralph Verney, 2nd Earl Verney. Later in 1759, Lord Verney constructed a new west wing for the house faced in stone to provide a suite of state apartments. Following his election as MP for Buckinghamshire in 1768, Verney vastly expanded this house to create a new central rotunda entrance hall and ballroom wing. The original conception was of a mansion to rival the richer Earl Temple&#x27;s huge mansion at Stowe, a few miles away near Buckingham. However, the house as it stands today is a fraction of its original planned size as the ballroom and rotunda were dismantled in 1791-92 after the Earl&#x27;s death. Lord Verney ran into financial problems before the latter two wings were entirely completed, and had to spend the final years of his life on the continent to escape his creditors. The estate was inherited by his niece, Mary Verney, 1st Baroness Fermanagh in 1791, who sold off much of the family&#x27;s land and sold the unfinished wing of the house off brick by brick.

==Exterior==
The exterior of the house is quite austere – seven bays in total, on two floors, with a three-bayed central prominent elevation surmounted by a pediment. The fenestration is of sash windows. (The ground floor windows are crowned by small round windows suggesting a non-existent mezzanine.) The centre bay contains a large central venetian window on the ground floor.

==Interior==
By contrast to the exterior the interiors are an extravaganza of rococo architecture in its highest form. The principal rooms: the north hall, a double cube room () may have lost its adjoining hall under the lost dome. However, its magnificence remains. The broken pedimented door cases are adorned with rococo carving, by Luke Lightfoot, the most talented wood carver of the era, who worked extensively on the great mansion. His work can be found on the ceiling and the niches in the walls. The adjoining saloon is slightly more restrained in its decoration. However the ornate carving continues into the dado rails, and onto the Corinthian columns supporting the huge Venetian window. The third principal room was redecorated as a library by Parthenope, Lady Verney in 1860. The plaster rococo ceiling remains in all its splendour.

A staircase of inlaid ivory and marquetry leads to the first floor. The walls of the staircase hall are ornamented with medallions and carved garlands reflecting the theme established in the main reception rooms. The wrought iron balustrade of the stairs contains ironwork ears of wheat, which rustle like the real thing as one ascends the flights.

The marvel of the first floor is the Chinese room: one of the most extraordinary rooms in the house if not England. Here the rococo continues, but this time in a form known as chinoiserie — essentially a Chinese version of the rococo decorative style. The entire room is a fantasy of carved pagodas, Chinese fretwork, bells and temples while oriental scrolls and swirls swoop around the walls and doors reaching a crescendo in the temple-like canopy, which would have once contained a bed, but now gives a throne-like importance to a divan.

Also on this floor is a small museum dedicated to the nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale, the sister of Parthenope, Lady Verney. In her later years Nightingale regularly stayed at the house.

==Claydon House today==
The present Verney family, are the descendants of Sir Harry Calvert, 2nd Baronet who inherited the house in 1827. He was very tenuously related to the Verneys only through marriage. However, he adopted the name Verney on inheriting. The house was given to the National Trust in 1956 by Sir Ralph Verney, 5th Baronet. His son, Sir Edmund Verney, 6th Baronet, a former High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, lived in the house until 2019.

Annually (usually the last weekend in July) at Claydon House, there is a hovercraft race meeting organised by the Chilterns Branch as part of the Hovercraft Club of Great Britain (UK) National Hovercraft Racing Series.

Claydon House has appeared in a number of films. Interiors were used for Emma in 1996. In 2013, Claydon House was used for interior and exterior shots for filming &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot;, a British film version of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel. In 2018, the interiors were used again for &quot;The Aeronauts&quot;, and again in 2020 for &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

<doc id="417960" wikidata="Q864658" url="?curid=417960" title="Paraclete">
<text>Paraclete (; ) is a Christian biblical term occurring five times in the Johannine texts of the New Testament. In Christian theology, the word commonly refers to the Holy Spirit and is translated as &#x27;advocate&#x27;, &#x27;counsellor&#x27;, or &#x27;helper&#x27;.

== Etymology ==
The English term &quot;Paraclete&quot; comes from the Koine Greek word (). A combination of (&#x27;beside/alongside&#x27;) and (&#x27;to call&#x27;), the word first appears in the Bible in John 14:16. René Kieffer further explains the development of the meaning of this term:

The word is a verbal adjective, often used of one called to help in a lawcourt. In the Jewish tradition the word was transcribed with Hebrew letters and used for angels, prophets, and the just as advocates before God&#x27;s court. The word also acquired the meaning of &#x27;one who consoles&#x27; (cf. Job 16:2, Theodotion&#x27;s and Aquila&#x27;s translations; the LXX has the correct word ). It is probably wrong to explain the Johannine on the basis of only one religious background. The word is filled with a complex meaning: the Spirit replaces Jesus, is an advocate and a witness, but also consoles the disciples.

=== Latin etymological precedent ===
Lochlan Shelfer suggests that the Greek term &quot;paraclete&quot; is a translation of the preceding Latin term :
&quot; [does not have] any independent meaning of its own, it is in fact a calque for the Latin term meaning a person of high social standing who speaks on behalf of a defendant in a court of law before a judge. When Greeks came into contact with the Roman Empire [...] the word was developed as a precise equivalent to the Latin legal term . Thus, its significance must be found not only in its very few extant appearances, but also in the specific use of the Latin legal term.&quot;

== In Classical Greek ==
The term is not common in non-Jewish texts. The best-known use is by Demosthenes:

&quot;A Greek–English Lexicon&quot; cites the example of a court of justice.

== In Judaism ==
Philo speaks several times of &quot;paraclete&quot; advocates primarily in the sense of human intercessors.

The word later went from Hellenistic Jewish writing into rabbinic literature.

Other words are used to translate the Hebrew word &#x27;comforter&#x27; and .
== In Christianity==
In the New Testament, &quot;paraclete&quot; appears only in the Johannine texts, and it is used only on five occasions: Gospel of John 14:16, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7, and First Epistle of John chapter 2, verse 1.

In John 14:16-17, &#x27;paraclete&#x27; is and &#x27;spirit&#x27; is (), meaning &#x27;breath&#x27;. appears over 250 times in the Christian New Testament, and is the word used to refer to the Holy Spirit, i.e., the Spirit of God. As a result of the immediate explanation in John 14:17, the Paraclete in John 14:16 is considered to be the Holy Spirit.

M. E. Boring, writing in the Cambridge University journal &quot;New Testament Studies&quot;, describes a &quot;striking similarity&quot; between the defined attributes of what the Paraclete is, and is to do, and what the outcome of Christian prophecy has spoken to, explaining the Paraclete as the post-Passover gift of the Holy Spirit. &quot;The Paraclete represents the Spirit as manifested in a particular way, as a pneumatic Christian speech charisma. Every verb describing the ministry of the Paraclete is directly related to his speech function.&quot;

The early church identified the Paraclete as the Holy Spirit. In first-century Jewish and Christian understanding, the presence of the Holy Spirit is to claim the rebirth of prophecy.

During his period as a hermit in the mid-12th century, Peter Abelard dedicated his chapel to the Paraclete because &quot;I had come there as a fugitive and, in the depths of my despair, was granted some comfort by the grace of God.&quot;

Today, the Holy Spirit continues to be referred to as the Paraclete in a prayer known as the Divine Praises, recited during Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.

===Scholarly interpretations ===
 quotes Jesus as saying &quot;another Paraclete&quot; will come to help his disciples, implying, according to Lawrence Lutkemeyer, that Jesus is the first and primary Paraclete. In Jesus himself is called &quot;paraclete&quot;.

Raymond Brown (1970), supported by George Johnston (2005), also says that the &quot;another Paraclete&quot; of John 14:16 is in many ways another Jesus, the presence of Jesus after Jesus ascends to his Father.

The Gospel of Matthew twice uses the passive form of the corresponding verb , in 2:18 and 5:4. In both instances, the context is of mourning, and the meaning of the verb is &#x27;to be comforted&#x27;.

===Paraclete first appearing in gospel===
Here is the context of the passage in John 14:15-27 with the translation of &quot;Paraclete&quot; as &quot;Advocate&quot; shown in bold:
== In Islam ==

Many Muslim writers have argued that &quot;another Paraclete&quot; (John 14:16)—the first being Jesus—refers to Muhammad. This claim is based on Quran 61:6.

A few Muslim commentators, such as David Benjamin Keldani (1928), have argued the theory that the original Koine Greek used was , meaning &#x27;famed, illustrious, or praiseworthy&#x27;, rendered in Arabic as (another name of Muhammad), and that this was substituted by Christians with . There are currently no known Greek manuscripts with this reading (all extant Greek manuscripts read ), although the earliest manuscript evidence available is from the 3rd century.

Regarding what the original Greek term was, according to A. Guthrie and E. F. F. Bishop:

Sean Anthony agrees that the connection of Ahmad to the Paraclete in the Gospel of John may have been a later tradition that is not found in the work of Ibn Ishaq and that the earliest extant attempts by Muslims to connect these two figures that inspire later discussion on the subject goes back to Ibn Hisham and Ibn Qutaybah.

A later interpolation of this passage to the Quran has been rejected in modern Islamic studies. This has been supported by the fact that the earliest as well as the later manuscripts of the Quran contain the same passage and wording in chapter 61.

===Historical development===
In Łewond&#x27;s version of the correspondence between the Byzantine emperor Leo III () and the Umayyad caliph Umar II (), a letter is attributed to Leo:
By the 8th-century, the identification of the Paraclete with Muhammad was already a known concept. Evidence shows that the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi () debated the concept with the influential Christian patriarch Timothy I (d. 823). The Persian theologian Ali al-Tabari (d. 870) believed that only Muhammad could have been the Paraclete since he taught people what they previously didn&#x27;t know. The Syrian scholar Ibn Abi Talib al-Dimashqi (d. 1327) asserts that the verses were generally believed to be about the coming of a prophet, until the reign of Constantine I () when the Christian priests altered the verses to refer to the Holy Spirit, fearing that Constantine would recognize the true faith.

<text>Oka is a semi-soft washed rind cheese that was originally manufactured by Trappist monks located in Oka, Quebec, Canada. The cheese is named after the town. It has a distinct flavour and aroma, and is still manufactured in Oka, although now by a commercial company. The recipe was sold in 1981 by Les Pères Trappistes to the Agropur cooperative. 

It was also manufactured by Trappist Monks at the Our Lady of the Prairies Monastery, located 8 miles southeast of Holland, Manitoba. A small Manitoba producer learned the process from Brother Albéric, but stopped making unpasteurized Trappist cheese in 2019 because of the cost of provincial regulations.

Brother Alphonse Juin arrived at the Notre-Dame du Lac Monastery in Quebec in 1893 with a recipe for Port-du-Salut cheese. He &quot;tweaked and adjusted&quot; the recipe, and Oka was born. Since that time, Quebec has become a major producer of Canadian Cheese.

Oka cheese has a pungent aroma and soft creamy flavour, sometimes described as nutty and fruity. The cheese, which is made from cow&#x27;s milk, is covered with a copper-orange, hand-washed rind. Its distinct flavour sets it apart from more common cheeses such as colby and cheddar, and does not go through a cheddaring process.

There are four types of Oka cheese: 
* &quot;Regular&quot; is pasteurized cow&#x27;s milk. It is ripened for four weeks. Several varieties of the regular version are also available including Ashed and Mushrooms and Truffle, as well as a limited edition Maple flavour.
* &quot;Classic&quot; is pasteurized and ripened for two months.
* &quot;Providence&quot; is of a much more creamy and soft texture than either &#x27;Classic&#x27; or &#x27;Regular&#x27;.
* &quot;Light&quot; is similar to &#x27;Regular&#x27;, but with a lower percentage of fat and always pasteurized.
* A Swiss style Oka has been introduced in regular and smoked varieties.
* An Oka-branded Raclette cheese is also available.
==History==

Oka cheese was heavily influenced by the work of the monks of the Cistercian Abbey of Notre-Dame du Lac (fr. &quot;Abbaye Cistercienne d&#x27;Oka&quot;). Within a few years, through an affiliation with the Université de Montréal, the monastery created an agricultural school. Frequently called the &quot;Abbaye Notre-Dame-du-Lac&quot;, the Trappist monastery became well known for its Port-Salut cheese, made from a Breton recipe brought with them from France.

<text>Moulsoe is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the border with Bedfordshire, and just east of the M1, situated about ESE of Newport Pagnell, and about NNE of Central Milton Keynes. The main road through the village is the Newport Road coming from the west, changing to the Cranfield Road going east at a bend by the church.

The village name is an Old English language word which means &#x27;Mul&#x27;s hill spur&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Moleshou&quot;.

At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 318, down slightly from 330 at the 2001 census. , the parish is mainly rural but a large area just west of the village has been identified for future expansion of Milton Keynes.

There are several old thatched dwellings. Other buildings are of brick apart from some concrete council houses to the west and the church which is of stone, and dates from the 12th century. There is an inn, the Carrington Arms, and a village hall, the Millennium Hall.

==Caldecote==

Caldecote is a tiny hamlet in the parish, notable because of it being mentioned in Domesday.

<text>The Long Good-bye is a novel by Raymond Chandler, published in 1953, his sixth novel featuring the private investigator Philip Marlowe. Some critics consider it inferior to &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; or &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, but others rank it as the best of his work. Chandler, in a letter to a friend, called the novel &quot;my best book&quot;.

The novel is notable for using hard-boiled detective fiction as a vehicle for social criticism and for including autobiographical elements from Chandler&#x27;s life. In 1955, the novel received the Edgar Award for Best Novel. It was later adapted as a 1973 film of the same name, updated to 1970s Los Angeles and starring Elliott Gould.

==Plot summary==
Outside of &quot;the Dancers,&quot; a club in Los Angeles, private detective Philip Marlowe meets Terry Lennox, a drunk with scars on one side of his face. They forge an uneasy friendship over the next few months, having drinks, especially gimlets, together at bars. In June, Lennox shows up late one night at Marlowe&#x27;s home in &quot;a great deal of trouble&quot; and needing a ride to the airport across the border in Tijuana. Marlowe agrees as long as Lennox does not tell him any details of why he is running. He later finds 5 $100 bills left to him by Terry.

On his return to Los Angeles, Marlowe learns that Lennox&#x27;s wife Sylvia was found dead; she had died before Lennox fled. Marlowe is arrested for aiding a suspected murderer after refusing to cooperate with police detectives, who want him to confess he helped Lennox flee. After three days of antagonizing his interrogators, Marlowe is released, the police explaining that Lennox has been reported to have committed suicide in a small Mexican town with a written confession by his side. Marlowe gets home to find a cryptic letter from Lennox containing a &quot;portrait of Madison&quot; (a $5,000 bill).
Marlowe gets a call from New York publisher Howard Spencer, who asks him to investigate a case. One of Spencer&#x27;s best writers, Roger Wade, has a drinking problem and has been missing for three days. Marlowe initially refuses, but after Wade&#x27;s wife, Eileen, also asks for Marlowe&#x27;s help, he consents. Marlowe finds Wade in a makeshift detox facility in an isolated and soon-to-be-abandoned ranch. He takes his fee, but the Wades&#x27; stories do not match.

The Wades each try to persuade Marlowe to stay at their house to keep Roger writing instead of drinking. Despite refusing, he makes further trips to the house at their behest. Marlowe is invited to an awkward cocktail party, where Dr. Edward Loring threatens Wade to leave his wife Linda alone. Marlowe accidentally met Mrs. Loring previously at a bar, where they were drinking gimlets together in memory of Lennox. Linda Loring is actually Sylvia Lennox&#x27;s sister, and knew Terry well.

After being called by a drunk and disoriented Roger, Marlowe arrives to find Wade passed out in the grass with a cut on his head and Mrs. Wade oddly uninterested in her husband&#x27;s welfare. He is put to bed with a head wound from a likely fall. Dr. Loring is called and examines Wade, not hiding his contempt. Wade wakes up and begs Marlowe to remove and destroy typewritten pages in his study he wrote while drunk, not wanting his wife to read them. 

Marlowe reads the pages, finding a cryptic self-analysis by Wade which hints at repressed trauma he does not quite understand alongside a clear statement that &quot;once a good man died&quot; for him. Marlowe keeps this evidence. Hearing a shot, he rushes to find the couple struggling over a gun in Roger&#x27;s bedroom. Marlowe sits with Roger until the latter has taken sleeping pills. As he is leaving, a distraught half-naked Eileen enters a sort of trance and attempts to seduce Marlowe, thinking him to be a former lover who died in the Second World War. Marlowe refuses and crashes on their couch, getting drunk and passing out to not be tempted by Eileen. The Wades&#x27; houseboy, Candy, makes threats against Marlowe. The next morning, Eileen behaves normally and Marlowe leaves.

Marlowe is repeatedly threatened to cease his investigation of the Lennox case, first by a gangster friend of Lennox&#x27;s named Mendy Menendez, then by Lennox&#x27;s wealthy father-in-law Harlan Potter, by his old friend Bernie Ohls from the LAPD, by Candy and by Mrs. Wade. Through his own hunches and inquiries, Marlowe learns that Terry Lennox had previously lived as Paul Marston, who had married and spent some time in England.

Roger calls Marlowe again, inviting him to the Wades&#x27; for lunch. After indulging in self-pity over his writing difficulties, he posits that he is an alcoholic because he is trying to find answers to the trauma in his past, offers Marlowe a check of $1,000, then proceeds to drink himself into a stupor. Marlowe asks him if he ever knew someone named Paul Marston, and with an effort Roger says no. Marlowe takes a walk outside. When he returns, Eileen is ringing the doorbell, having forgotten her key. Marlowe finds Roger dead on the couch, apparently from suicide, but Eileen accuses Marlowe of killing him. Candy fabricates a story of Marlowe sleeping with Mrs. Wade to implicate Marlowe, believing him to be guilty, but his claims are undermined in an interrogation. The police do not hold Marlowe.

Marlowe receives a call from Spencer regarding Wade&#x27;s death and bullies Spencer into taking him to see Mrs. Wade. Once there, Marlowe grills her on the death of Sylvia Lennox. Eileen first tries to blame it all on Roger but Marlowe pokes holes in her story, arguing that she killed both Mrs. Lennox and Roger Wade and that Lennox was her first husband, presumed killed while serving with the British Commandos in Norway during the war. Eileen Wade leaves with no response. The next morning, Marlowe learns that she has killed herself by overdosing on painkillers, leaving a note describing the affair Mrs. Lennox was having with her husband and confessing to killing them both in a jealous rage.

Marlowe refuses to let the story lie, and when the authorities decide to forgo an inquest because it will show them up, he steals a photostat of Eileen&#x27;s confession from the police. Marlowe contacts a reporter he knows in order to make sure the confession is printed, even though the reporter warns him that he&#x27;ll make numerous enemies by doing so. Marlowe replies that he has been trying to say goodbye to Terry Lennox for &quot;a long, long time.&quot; A few days later Marlowe is assaulted by Menendez, who is then arrested by Ohls in a setup. Ohls explains that Marlowe was intentionally left in a position to steal a photostat because the police wanted to trap Menendez in a felony, and Ohls knew that Marlowe&#x27;s scruples and stubbornness would lead him to do the best he could to clear Lennox&#x27;s name.

Mrs. Linda Loring has called Marlowe previously, informing him that she is getting a divorce from her husband Dr. Loring, who has subsequently written prescriptions for massive doses of Demerol to the late Mrs. Wade, allowing her to overdose. Linda pays a visit to Marlowe&#x27;s house with an overnight bag, and they drink champagne together. She stays for the night and even proposes a marriage to Marlowe. In the morning they part amicably, Linda leaving for Paris.

Later, Marlowe is visited by a Mexican man who claims to have been present when Lennox was killed in his hotel room. Marlowe listens to his story but rejects it and offers his own version, ending with the revelation the Mexican man is none other than Lennox himself, who has had cosmetic surgery. Lennox attempts to make amends for the trouble he has caused Marlowe but is rebuffed. While Marlowe claims that he doesn&#x27;t judge him for what he did, he returns the $5,000 bill and says Lennox is &quot;not here anymore.&quot; Lennox is hurt by this and leaves after saying goodbye. The novel ends with Marlowe listening to Lennox leave and faintly hoping he might return but instead explaining that he never saw him again.

== Background ==
&quot;The Long Good-bye&quot; is Chandler&#x27;s most personal novel. He wrote it as his wife Cissie was dying. Her long illness and death had a profound effect on him, driving him into fits of melancholy and leading him to talk of and even to attempt suicide. Two characters in the novel are based on Chandler; both of them highlight Chandler&#x27;s awareness of his flaws—his alcoholism and his doubts about the value of his writing.

The character most clearly based on Chandler is the usually drunken writer Roger Wade. Like Chandler, Wade had a string of successful novels behind him, but as he grew older he found it more difficult to write. Also, like Chandler, Wade had written novels (romantic fiction) that were viewed by many as not real literature, whereas Wade wants to be thought of as a serious author. Wade also stands in for Chandler in discussions about literature, as in his praise of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

The other Chandler stand-in is Terry Lennox. Like Chandler, Lennox is an alcoholic. Also like Chandler, he had fought in a war which left emotional scars. For Lennox, it was the Second World War; for Chandler, it was the First. Lennox is a Canadian citizen but he had spent a great deal of time in England and retained the restrained and formal attitude of an English gentleman. This made him somewhat of an anomaly in the fast-paced and more informal world of wealthy Los Angeles, which he inhabited because of his wife&#x27;s money. 

Chandler was also raised in England and received a classical education there. Chandler also retained a great love for the English and what he viewed as their more civilised way of life compared with the shallowness and superficiality of Los Angeles. This frequently put him at odds with screenwriting collaborators, such as Billy Wilder, and with most of Los Angeles and Hollywood society.

==Film, television, and radio adaptations==
This novel was dramatized for television in 1954 for the anthology series &quot;Climax!&quot;, with Dick Powell playing Marlowe, as he had a decade earlier in the film &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;. The episode, which was broadcast live, was known for supposedly containing a scene where actor Tris Coffin, who was playing a corpse in a morgue, got up off a stretcher in full view of the camera. However, in a later interview, Coffin debunked this as a rumor; while the blanket over his body was partially removed before he was out of frame, he did not walk off set in full view of the camera.

In 1973, Robert Altman filmed a very free adaptation set in contemporary Los Angeles, with Elliott Gould as Marlowe.

An adaptation of the novel was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 16 January 1978, with Ed Bishop as Marlowe, and again on 1 October 2011, with Toby Stephens as Marlowe as part of its Classic Chandler series. Japanese broadcaster NHK aired five episodes of a Japanese adaptation of the novel in 2014.

==Appearances in other works==
&quot;The Long Good-bye&quot; has been referred to in other works of fiction. Greg Iles referred to Chandler and the novel&#x27;s title in his own novel &quot;The Quiet Game&quot;, in which one character is named Marston. It has been featured in the Japanese tokusatsu drama &quot;Kamen Rider W&quot;, in which the main character constantly reads from a Japanese version of the book. Also, the character of Marlowe is directly referenced as the inspiration behind the name of the character, Philip. Michael Connelly refers to the novel&#x27;s title and quotes from it in his own novel &quot;The Black Ice&quot;. There are flashbacks to the events in this novel in the &quot;hommage&quot; Marlowe novel &quot;The Black-Eyed Blonde&quot;.

The novel&#x27;s title has been alluded to in the titles of other works of fiction with a hardboiled, noir, detective or gangster theme, including the British gangster film &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), an episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; entitled &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot; (1988), and Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot; (1991–92), the first volume in the &quot;Sin City&quot; series.

In music, crime novelist Matt Rees&#x27;s band Poisonville, which is named after the fictitious location of the Dashiell Hammett novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, released a song about &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; on its first album. Rees described the novel as &quot;a creepier book than people think.&quot;

The 1973 novel &quot;Triste, Solitario y Final&quot; by Argentine writer Osvaldo Soriano refers to the final words of Phillip Marlowe to Terry Lennox: &quot;I won&#x27;t say goodbye. I said it to you when it meant something. I said it when it was sad and lonely and final&quot;.

<text>Kazanlak ( , known as Seuthopolis () in ancient times, is a town in Stara Zagora Province, Bulgaria. It is located in the middle of the plain of the same name, at the foot of the Balkan mountain range, at the eastern end of the Rose Valley. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Kazanlak Municipality.

The town is among the 15 biggest industrial centres in Bulgaria, with a population of 44,760 people as of Dec 2017.

It is the center of rose oil extraction in Bulgaria and the oil-producing rose of Kazanlak is one of the most widely recognizable national symbols.

== History ==

The oldest settlement in the area of the modern-day city dates back to the Neolithic era (6th-5th millennium BCE). During the 4th-3rd centuries BCE the lands on the upper Tundzha river were within the dominion of the Thracian ruler Seuthes III and took an important place in the historical development of Thrace during the Hellenistic era. The Thracian city of Seuthopolis (Σευθόπολις) was uncovered near Kazanlak and thoroughly studied at the time of the construction of the Koprinka Reservoir. In the 4th century BCE, near the ancient Thracian capital of Seuthopolis and close to the city, a magnificent Thracian tomb was built. Consisting of a vaulted brickwork &quot;beehive&quot; (&quot;tholos&quot;) tomb, it contains, among other things, painted murals representing a Thracian couple at a ritual funeral feast. The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

In the Middle Ages the valley became an administrative center of the Krun region where the Bulgarian boyar Aldimir (Eltimir) ruled. After 1370 Kazanlak was under Ottoman dominion. Its modern name is derived from the Turkish &quot;Kazanlık&quot;.
The modern city dates back to the beginning of the 15th century. It was founded as a military fortress to protect the Shipka Pass and later developed as a city of craftsmen. More than 50 handcrafts developed such as tanning, coppersmithing, goldsmithing, frieze weaving, shoemaking, cooperage and, of course, rose cultivation. The oil-producing rose, imported from central Asia via Persia, Syria and Turkey, found all the necessary conditions to thrive – proper temperature, high moisture and light, sandy, cinnamon-forest soils. Kazanlak rose oil has won gold medals at expositions in Paris, London, Philadelphia, Antwerp, Laet, and Milan. After Bulgarian independence the handcrafts declined due to the loss of the markets in the huge Ottoman Empire. The textile, aerospace and military industries were developed.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
The Bulgarian climate is temperate, with average temperatures from to in January, and in July. The average altitude is .

Spring temperatures rise comparatively early and are usually above (in the first half of March) and above (in the first half of April) but sometimes there are also some cold spring periods.

The summer temperatures are moderate and the average summer rainfall is rather high, especially at the beginning of summer. During the second half of the summer and the beginning of the autumn, there are continuous drops in rainfall. Until the middle of November, the average autumn temperature is above , and above until the end of October.

The winter is mild, with comparatively low snowfall, short-lasting snow-cover and low minimum temperatures. The highest rainfall is in June, and the lowest in February and March. The general wind direction is from north-east.

=== Relief ===
The town of Kazanlak and the surrounding region is situated in the western part of the Kazanlak Valley. There are various soil types, mostly maroon soils (about 50%) which are very suitable for growing oleaginous cultures and herbs.

The Kazanlak Valley was formed during the Quaternary Period with the rise of the Balkan and Sredna Gora Mountains and the submergence of the Fore-Balkan fields. The fault character of the Valley is evidenced by the hot mineral springs near the village of Ovoshtnik, Yagoda and the town of Pavel Banya.

Morphologically, the Kazanlak Valley is divided into three areas. The western area is the broadest one and has a lot of hills due to the numerous alluvials, formed by the rivers flowing through the Balkan Mountains. Although the average altitude is , here it reaches up to . The central area is narrower and lower, and the relief of the eastern area is much more complex.

=== Soils and mineral resources ===
Soil cover is closely related to the relief, climate, flora of the region and the economical activity of the man. The varied Bulgarian natural environment has produced about 20 soil types and subtypes.

This region is characterised mainly by cinnamon-forest soil. The spreading of the accumulative river materials along the Tundzha river and the Eninska river has formed alluvial soil types and subtypes. The draining and the deeply intended geological base together with the drought-resistant and thermophilic forest vegetation (oak, field elm, hornbeam) are the reason for the spreading of the forest soils.

The arable lands related to this soil type are inclined and that leads to the degradable effect of the plane, linear and ravine erosion. The alluvial soils are high-productive – they are represented by arable lands of I, II and III category. They cover two-thirds of the searched territory and this is an obstruction to the town growth.

The lands are planted mainly with roses and perennial plants. Low-productive and degraded lands are located only north-east of Kazanlak. Part of them are covered with meadows and pastures. This region is not rich in mineral resources of industrial importance but there are several non-metalliferous minerals of local importance. There is a clay deposit for brick manufacturing in Manastirska Niva locality two km west of Kazanlak. A greisen-pit for broken stone, paving stones, and kerbs is located east of the town in Kara Dere locality.

Sand, gravel, and felt are extracted from the pits near the villages of Ovoshtnik and Cherganovo.
There are granite pits near the villages of Kanchevo and Bouzovgrad. The granite is used for kerbs, paving stones, and others.

=== Water resources ===

The Kazanlak valley is drained by the Tundzha river and its tributaries. The Tundzha river rises in the highest part of the Balkan east of Mount Botev, flows across several fields – Kalofersko Pole, Kazanlashko Pole, Slivensko Pole, Yambolsko Pole and Elhovsko Pole and empties into the Maritsa river. The total length of its Bulgarian section is , and its drainage basin area is . The river flows slowly in Kazanlak valley near the north slopes of Sredna Gora mountain. The average annual water quantity increases southwards.

At Koprinka dam it is per second on average or about per year; at the village of Knezha it is per second or per year. But this water quantity is not equally distributed during the whole year. The maximum is in spring (April and May) due to the intensive snow melting and high rainfalls in spring. The underground waters of the considerable in range and flow rate alluvial cones play an important role in the drain regulation during summer season when the rainfall is minimum. Southwest of the village of Koprinka the river valley is deeply cut in the slope of Sredna Gora mountain and this narrowness was used for the Koprinka dam construction which permits the irrigation of the land round Kazanlak and Stara Zagora. Many tributaries feed the Tundzha river; those rising in the Balkan mountains are numerous and deeper.

The rivers Tazha, Leshnitsa, Eninska and Maglizhka and their deeply cut in the Balkan slopes valleys are of remarkable beauty. The Kran river rises in the village of Kran and collecting several spring flows through the western part of the town and gradually disappears in the terrace materials of the Tundzha river.

The Eninska river rises in the Balkan, collects the waters of many springs, flows through the eastern part of Kazanlak and empties into the Tundzha river south of the town. Both tributaries have deeply cut valleys in their upper courses. In the lower courses the terrain is not so inclined and the river beds are wider. The average annual water quantity of the Eninska river at the village of Enina is per second. The maximum water flow is in April and May, at and per second, respectively. The minimum is in September at per second. These tributaries (especially the Eninska river) are characterised by plenty of alluvial formations.

Many gullies run down the slopes of Tulbeto hill (located in the north-eastern part of the town) when heavy rain falls or snow melts and carry to the Eninska river heavy alluvial formations. Two or three km north of Kazanlak the rivers Eninska and Kranska are connected by a drain carrying off the water directed towards the town. South of the town there is another drain system carrying the disappearing in the alluvial cone waters from the rivers Eninska and Kranska towards the Tundzha river.

== Population ==
During the first decade after the liberation of Bulgaria, in the 1880s the population of Kazanlak numbered about 9,000. Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns, reaching its peak in 1985 exceeding 60,000. After this time, the population has started decreasing rapidly in consequence of the poor economic situation in the Bulgarian provinces during the 1990s that led to a new migration in the direction of the country capital Sofia and abroad.

=== Ethnic groups ===
== Culture ==

Kazanlak has a long, solid tradition in the area of culture and enlightenment. At the every beginning of the Revival, the populace of Kazanlak was already opening school and cultural reading centers – including the Pedagogical school of Kazanlak, which prepared teachers for the entire country. For many well-known Bulgarian artists and performers, this was the place where their physical and creative lives began. The cultural centre of Kazanlak is the &quot;Iskra&quot; chitalishte, founded in 1860. It contains a library, theatre, cinema, and museum. It was host to the first Bulgarian opera, &quot;Siromahkinya&quot;.
* Iskra Library – one of the oldest libraries in Bulgaria, founded in 1860, now holds over 500 volumes.
* Rosarium Park with many spots for recreation.
* The House – museums of famous Bulgarian artists Dechko Uzunov and Nenko Balkanski.
* The Thracian tombs. The remains discovered from the ancient Thracian culture – objects, jewelry, and vessels of gold, silver, bronze and clay – have long since become part of the world historical legacy.

=== Iskra Town History Museum ===
The Iskra Town History Museum is one of the first provincial town museums in Bulgaria. It was founded on 29 June 1901, by Peter Topuzov – a bright man of enterprise from Kazanlak and by decision of the leaders of Iskra Studious Club. More than 50 000 exhibits revealing the history of Kazanlak area from ancient times until nowadays have been kept at Iskra museum. The finds from Thracian town of Seuthopolis are displayed in three separate halls. Temporary exhibitions with valuable articles from this museum and loan-collections are arranged during the active tourist season.

=== Rose Museum ===
The museum is a part of the Historical Museum &quot;Iskra&quot; in Kazanlak. In 1967 a small exposition was created, which was dedicated to rose-picking in Kazanlak and the region. In 1969 the exposition grew into an independent museum. Nowadays the Rose Museum stores more than 15 000 exponents related to rose-picking and rose-production in Bulgaria. The museum exposition includes original pictures and documents of the development of rose production, instruments for processing of the rose gardens, vessels for storing and exporting rose oil and rose water. Restorations of a rose warehouse and the first laboratory for examination of rose oil created in 1912 are made in the museum. One of the biggest attractions in the museum is a rose oil vessel which had been used for the last time in 1947 to this day a strong rose scent can still be smelled around it.

=== Koulata Ethnographic Complex ===
The charming cobbled Mirska Street is in the oldest part of the city – Koulata District, near the world-famous Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak. This is where traditional architecture from the period of the Bulgarian National Revival (18th–19th centuries) can be found. The traditional buildings there constitute the Koulata Ethnographic Complex, restored and open to visitors since 1976. They &quot;take us back&quot; to the unique, diverse material culture of Bulgarians from the Kazanlak region of the past.

Before stepping through the gate, visitors can hear the coppersmiths’ hammers. They tell the stories of the typical local coppersmiths’ craft. Opposite are the violin-makers and next door is the goldsmith&#x27;s. The country house nestles among bushes and trees. It is one-storied and asymmetrical. It has the characteristic of the Balkan valley houses from the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

The lifestyle of the late 19th and early 20th century inhabitants of the region is shown in the restored houses from the time of the Bulgarian Renaissance. The artefacts displayed here are kept in the Ethnography department. Kazanlak was a famous crafts town in the near past. Visitors can try some of the rose industry products – jam, liqueur, and gyulovitsa (rose brandy).

=== Buzludzha National Park ===
Buzludzha National Park rises east of the Shipka pass. It is a very important part of Bulgarian history – here, on 30 July 1868, Hadzhi Dimitar fell in battle. He was at the head of a small group of rebels fighting the numerous Turkish enemy. In 1961 a monument was built here to commemorate this act of heroism. The impressive marble figure of Hadji Dimiter is outlined against the green background of the pine-trees. Near it, under the venerable beeches, a stone bas relief commemorates another event in Bulgarian history – founding of the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Social Democratic Party on 2 August 1891, after a clandestine congress. Buzludzha with its numerous chalets, rest homes and hotels offers excellent opportunities for the lovers of winter sports and tourism.

=== Shipka National Park ===
Shipka National Park is founded on the same area where the bloody battles of the Russian-Turkish Liberation War occurred during the 1870s. It represents a complex of memorial tablets, monuments, trenches, and bunkers reminiscent of the battle.

On the top of the mount at Shipka rises the &quot;Freedom Monument&quot;. It was paid for by voluntary donations of the Bulgarian people and built after the design of Atanas Donkov, an architect, and Alexander Andreev, a sculptor. The monument was opened officially in 1934. The monument&#x27;s expositions relate the story of Russian soldiers&#x27; and Bulgarian volunteers&#x27; heroism during the five-month defence of the pass.

The national Shipka-Buzludza park-museum includes Shipka Memorial Church (or Church of the Nativity) near the town of Shipka, Shipka National Park, Freedom Monument near the village of Sheinovo, and Buzludza National Park.

=== The Shipka Memorial Church ===

The Shipka Memorial Church is north of Kazanlak, at the south foot of the Stara Planina mountains near the town of Shipka. It was erected after Bulgarian independence as a monument to Russian and Bulgarian dead. The golden domes and the green and pink façade loom against the mountains and attract the attention of the travelers in the Shipka pass.

The project design following 17th century Russian church architecture with arks, friezes, pediments, and gold-plated ornaments, was the work of the Czech architect A.I. Tomisko. The main entrance has three arks, topped off with the distinctive high spire of the bell tower. There are 17 bells; the heaviest of them weighs about . The lime-tree iconostasis is richly decorated with gilded wood-carvings and is of great artistic value.

The icons were presented by Russian monks from the monastery of St. Pantaleimon on Mount Athos, Greece. The names of the Russian regiments and of Russian and Bulgarian dead are inscribed on 34 marble plates built in the walls of the church. The honoured dust of the Russian soldiers killed at Shipka Pass (1877–78) have been kept in 17 stone sarcophagi in the crypt. The Shipka Memorial church was ceremoniously consecrated on 27 September 1902.

=== Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak ===
The tomb is part of a large Thracian necropolis. It comprises a narrow corridor and a round burial chamber, both decorated with murals representing a Thracian couple at a ritual funeral feast. The monument dates back to the 4th century BCE and has been on the UNESCO protected World Heritage Site list since 1979. The murals are memorable for the splendid horses and for a gesture of farewell, in which the seated couple grasp each other&#x27;s wrists in a moment of tenderness and equality (according to Lyudmila Zhivkova—a view that is not shared by all specialists). The paintings are Bulgaria&#x27;s best-preserved artistic masterpieces from the Hellenistic period.

The tomb is situated near the ancient Thracian capital of Seuthopolis in a region where more than a thousand tombs of kings and members of the Thracian aristocracy can be found.

The seated woman of the murals is depicted on the reverse of the Bulgarian 50 stotinki coin issued in 2005.

=== The Kosmatka Tomb ===
One of the most impressive monuments of the Thracian civilization in the Valley of the Thracian Kings, is the heroon (a temple-tomb of a hero of royal status) of Seuthes III. In the summer of 2004 a team of Bulgarian archaeologists unearthed a large, intact Thracian mausoleum dating back from the 5th century BCE near the Bulgarian town of Shipka, Kazanlak municipality. The temple was buried under the high &quot;Golyamata Kosmatka&quot; mound. &quot;This is probably the richest tomb of a Thracian king ever discovered in Bulgaria. Its style and its making are entirely new to us as experts,&quot; said Georgi Kitov, the head of the team.

The Kosmatka Tomb represents a remarkable Thracian heroon built accordingly to the Orphic traditions of the end of the 5th or beginning of the 4th century BCE. Serving also as a symbolic tomb of Seuthes III, it contained an enormous treasure, exhibited now in the Iskra Museum and Art Gallery. More than 70 silver, gold and bronze objects, which were used as ritual offering to the gods, were discovered during the excavations.

The temple was used between the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 3rd century BCE, when a symbolic burial ceremony of Seuthes III took place, the famous founder of the Thracian city of Seuthopolis, located only away. After the symbolic burial ceremony, the temple was closed and the entrance sealed and buried.

=== Literary and Art Museum of &quot;Chudomir&quot; ===
Among the town&#x27;s more interesting attractions is the house of the acclaimed Bulgarian writer, artist, and activist Dimitar Chorbadzhiiski, whose pen name was Chudomir (1890–1967). The house was declared a museum the year after his death, in 1968, and now has the status of a national historical cultural landmark, as confirmed by Protocol 15 of the State Records for 3 December 1968. The museum complex, remodeled and reopened in 1979, now includes the artist&#x27;s house and an art exhibition and related documents housed in three halls, covering an area of 300 square meters. Here there are more than 15,000 original manuscripts, paintings, sketches, letters, books, and personal effects that belonged to Chudomir and his wife, the artist Mara Chorbadzhiiska. This is the only museum in Bulgaria dedicated to both literature and art, and it is also the headquarters of the respected Chudomir Cultural Foundation. The museum is also one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.

<doc id="417974" wikidata="Q3284374" url="?curid=417974" title="Mursley">
<text>Mursley is a small village in and also a civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about three miles east of Winslow and about seven miles south west of Central Milton Keynes.

The village name is Old English in origin, and is thought to mean &#x27;Myrsa&#x27;s woodland clearing&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Muselai&quot;, with the form &quot;Murselai&quot; being attested from the thirteenth century.

The village was at one time a more important place; it was once a market town, by virtue of a royal charter granted in 1230, and the centre of the local deanery. &quot;The prosperity of the town continued until well into the 17th century&quot; but around the middle of the 18th century, Mursley was described as having &quot;dwindled into a neglected village&#x27;, being &#x27;small and depopulated&#x27;, the parish having about 66 families and 258 souls.&quot;

There was at one time a manor in the locality called &quot;Salden&quot;, within which stood a manor house built by the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1589 until 1603, John Fortescue of Salden (1531–1607). The manor house was visited by King James I and Anne of Denmark in 1603. It has since disappeared.

Actor David Tomlinson, who played George Banks in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and Mr. Emelius Browne in &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, lived and raised his children in Mursley until his death on 24 June 2000. Tomlinson became notorious around the village for flying very low in his Tiger Moth and on one occasion, he crash landed in a field near his house and was tried for, but acquitted of, reckless flying.

The Beechams estate in the village draws its name from Sir Thomas Beecham who resided in Mursley Hall which used to exist on the site of this estate.

Mursley&#x27;s Church of England School is a Victorian, Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary controlled infant school, which has approximately 45 pupils from the age of four through to the age of seven.

==Sport and leisure==
Mursley has a non-League football team Mursley United F.C. who play at the playing field in Station Road.

There is also a grassroots cricket team called Mursley CC. They play on Sundays against other local villages with a huge array of local talent. TB the teams lower order batsman scored a match winning maiden 31 runs in 5 overs to beat Stoke Hammond CC.

<text>A remote terminal unit (RTU) is a microprocessor-controlled electronic device that interfaces objects in the physical world to a distributed control system or SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system by transmitting telemetry data to a master system, and by using messages from the master supervisory system to control connected objects. Other terms that may be used for RTU are remote telemetry unit and remote telecontrol unit.

==Architecture==
An RTU monitors the field digital and analog parameters and transmits data to a SCADA Master Station. It runs setup software to connect data input streams to data output streams, define communication protocols, and troubleshoot installation problems in the field.

An RTU may consist of one complex circuit card consisting of various sections needed to do a custom-fitted function, or may consist of many circuit cards including a CPU or processing with communications interface(s), and one or more of the following: (AI) analog input, (DI) digital (status) input, (DO/CO) digital (or control relay) output, or (AO) analog output card(s).

An RTU might even be a small process control unit with a small database for PID, Alarming, Filtering, Trending and other functions complemented with some BASIC (programming language) tasks. Modern RTUs typically support the IEC 61131-3 programming standard for programmable logic controllers. Since RTUs may be routinely deployed in pipeline and grid guarding systems, or in other hard-to-reach or extreme environments (for example in the Biosphere 2 project), they are required to operate under harsh conditions, and implement energy-saving measures (such as switching off IO modules when not in use). For example, it communicates via RS485 or wireless communication links in a multi-drop configuration. In this type of configuration it is a remote unit that collects data and performs simple control tasks. It does not have moving parts and uses extremely low power and is often solar powered. 

===Power supply===
A form of power supply will be included for operation from the AC mains for various CPU, status wetting voltages and other interface cards. This may consist of AC to DC converters where operated from a station battery system.

RTUs may include a battery and charger circuitry to continue operation in event of AC power failure for critical applications where a station battery is not available.

===Digital (status) inputs===
Most RTUs incorporate an input section or input status cards to acquire two state real-world information. This is usually accomplished by using an isolated voltage or current source to sense the position of a remote contact (open or closed) at the RTU site. This contact position may represent many different devices, including electrical breakers, liquid valve positions, alarm conditions, and mechanical positions of devices. Counter inputs are optional.

===Analog inputs===
An RTU can monitor analog inputs of different types including 0-1 mA, 4–20 mA current loop, 0–10 V., ±2.5 V, ±5.0 V etc. 
Many RTU inputs buffer larger quantities via transducers to convert and isolate real-world quantities from sensitive RTU input levels.
An RTU can also receive analog data via a communication system from a master or IED (intelligent electronic device) sending data values to it.

The RTU or host system translates and scales this raw data into the appropriate units such as the quantity of water left, temperature degrees, or Megawatts, before presenting the data to the user via the human–machine interface.

===Digital (control relay) outputs===
RTUs may drive high current capacity relays to a digital output (or &quot;DO&quot;) board to switch power on and off to devices in the field. The DO board switches voltage to the coil in the relay, which closes the high current contacts, which completes the power circuit to the device.

RTU outputs may also consist of driving a sensitive logic input on an electronic PLC, or other electronic device using a sensitive 5 V input.

===Analog outputs===
While not as commonly used, analog outputs may be included to control devices that require varying quantities, such as graphic recording instruments (strip charts). Summed or processed data quantities may be generated in a master SCADA system and output for display locally or remotely, wherever needed.

===Software and logic control===
Modern RTUs are usually capable of executing simple programs autonomously without involving the host computers of the DCS or SCADA system to simplify deployment and to provide redundancy for safety reasons. An RTU in a modern water management system will typically have code to modify its behavior when physical override switches on the RTU are toggled during maintenance by maintenance personnel. This is done for safety reasons; a miscommunication between the system operators and the maintenance personnel could cause system operators to mistakenly enable power to a water pump when it is being replaced, for example.

Maintenance personnel should have any equipment they are working on disconnected from power and locked to prevent damage and/or injury.

===Communications===
An RTU may be interfaced to multiple master stations and IEDs (Intelligent Electronic Devices) with different communication protocols (usually serial (RS-232, RS-485, RS-422) or Ethernet). An RTU may support standard protocols (Modbus, IEC 60870-5-101/103/104, DNP3, IEC 60870-6-ICCP, IEC 61850 etc.) to interface any third party software.

Data transfer may be initiated from either end using various techniques to ensure synchronization with minimal data traffic. The master may poll its subordinate unit (Master to RTU or RTU to IED) for changes of data on a periodic basis. Analog value changes will usually be reported only on changes outside a set limit from the last transmitted value. Digital (status) values observe a similar technique and only transmit groups (bytes) when one included point (bit) changes. Another method used is where a subordinate unit initiates an update of data upon a predetermined change in analog or digital data. Complete data transmission must be performed periodically, with either method, to ensure full synchronization and eliminate stale data. Most communication protocols support both methods, programmable by the installer.

Multiple RTUs or IEDs may share a communications line, in a multi-drop scheme, as units are addressed uniquely and only respond to their own polls and commands.

====IED communications====
IED communications transfer data between the RTU and an IED (Intelligent Electronic Devices) . This can eliminate the need for many hardware status inputs, analog inputs, and relay outputs in the RTU. Communications are accomplished by copper or fibre optics lines.

====Master communications====
Master communications usually occur between an RTU and a larger control system or a data collection system (incorporated into a larger system). Data may be moved using a copper, fibre optic or radio frequency communication system.

<doc id="417978" wikidata="Q610438" url="?curid=417978" title="Segata Sanshiro">
<text>is a character created by Sega to advertise the Sega Saturn in Japan between 1997 and 1998. He is a parody of Sugata Sanshirō, a legendary judo fighter from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1943 film &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;. In television and radio advertisements, Segata Sanshiro is portrayed by actor Hiroshi Fujioka. He was positioned as a martial artist who commanded people to play Sega Saturn games.

The advertising campaign began in 1997, with the Saturn having a modest level of success in Japan at that point. Fujioka was impressed by Sega&#x27;s ideas for the character and felt that Segata Sanshiro would send a strong message to children. Advertisements continued both on television and on radio until 1999. As a result of the advertisements, Segata Sanshiro&#x27;s theme song became a CD single and he was made the main character of his own video game, &quot;Segata Sanshirō Shinken Yūgi&quot;.

Segata Sanshiro has also had cameo appearances in video games, a comic book and a live concert. He has retained a cult following in Japan and has been credited with helping improve Saturn sales there. Western journalists have praised the appeal and advertising prowess of the character.

== Advertising campaign ==
Sega&#x27;s advertising campaign with Segata Sanshiro began in the summer of 1997, more than two years after the Japanese release of the Sega Saturn. At that time, the Saturn was moderately successful in Japan. Hiroshi Fujioka, an actor famous for starring in &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, was selected to play the role in advertisements. The character of Segata Sanshiro was a parody of Sugata Sanshirō, a legendary judo fighter from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;. In part because Fujioka bore a vague resemblance to Susumu Fujita, the actor who portrayed Sugata Sanshirō, the parody was obvious to a Japanese public audience. Fujioka was also a skilled martial artist, experienced in multiple disciplines including karate, iaido, and judo, making him a close fit for the role. The character of Segata Sanshiro was positioned as a martial artist who commanded people to play Sega Saturn games. His name sounds similar to his catchphrase in Japanese, , as well as , a reference to the white color model of the Japanese Sega Saturn which followed the original gray version. According to Fujioka, he did give input on the character and contributed ideas. Fujioka was impressed by Sega&#x27;s ideas for the character, stating &quot;I thought it was good that they wanted to send a strong message to children in an age when young people had no direction.&quot;

The first television advertisement featuring Segata Sanshiro aired on November 28, 1997, promoting &quot;Sonic R&quot;. Television advertisements would continue from 1997 to 1999 and would feature Segata in real life scenarios related thematically with the game being advertised. In the advertisement for &quot;Burning Rangers&quot;, Segata rescued a woman inside a burning building, while the advertisement for &quot;Winter Heat&quot; featured him racing a speed skater on foot across ice. Other games advertised include &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot;, &quot;Shining Force III&quot;,&quot;&quot; &quot;Saturn Bomberman Fight!!&quot;, &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Deep Fear&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Force II.&quot;

In addition to television, Fujioka also recorded radio advertisements in support of the console. During production, Fujioka maintained a very serious focus on his performance of the character, even while doing tasks such as breaking ten roof tiles with his head or punching the buttons of a giant Saturn controller. In playing the role, Fujioka stated that he felt strongly he was doing work that would be a positive influence on society, and that he did actually enjoy Sega Saturn games and felt &quot;they put out a message to the world.&quot;

As part of the television advertisements, Segata Sanshiro&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Sega Satān, shiro!&quot;, was played. The song was written by Koji Ando, composed and arranged by Fumio Okui, and performed by Ichiro Tomita. As Segata gained popularity, the theme song became popular enough to warrant the recording of a CD single. Fujioka recorded this version himself, having previously sang the theme song for &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!! Rider Kick&quot;, for its first thirteen episodes as well as a few singles between 1971 and 1985. In addition to the CD, Fujioka also made several appearances as Segata Sanshiro at promotional events. Segata&#x27;s popularity also led to the release of a Saturn game, &quot;Segata Sanshirō Shinken Yūgi&quot;, on October 29, 1998. At the end of 1998, the launch of Sega&#x27;s next video game console, the Dreamcast, was approaching and Saturn development was slowing down. Segata Sanshiro was in one last advertisement, leaping from the roof of Sega&#x27;s headquarters to save Sega employees from an incoming missile launched at the building by a criminal presumed to be working for a rival company. Segata then rode the missile into space, presumably being killed in the process.

In 2020, Sega began a campaign starring Segata Sanshiro&#x27;s son, Sega Shiro, in celebration of the company&#x27;s 60th anniversary. The character is played by Fujioka&#x27;s son, Maito Fujioka. As part of the commercials, Shiro confronts a rival, &quot;Sega Hatan Shiro&quot;, who is later revealed to be Segata Sanshiro in disguise.

==Later appearances==
Fujioka appeared as Segata at the official launch of the Dreamcast, as well as in a one-off appearance on Fuji TV at the end of 1999. The character would later appear in Issue 269 of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; from Archie Comics, in which he faced Sonic the Hedgehog in a fighting tournament inspired by the game &quot;Sonic the Fighters.&quot; Segata Sanshiro also has an appearance in &quot;Rent A Hero No. 1&quot;, a Japanese game released on both the Dreamcast and Xbox. He serves as a martial arts instructor who can teach new moves to the main character. He makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, and is playable in &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot; as a solo unit. Producer Kensuke Tsukanaka stated that it was a desire of Namco Bandai to include Segata Sanshiro in the latter game. Fujioka returned as Segata in 2013 at a live concert thrown by Sega, and spoke to the crowd with Sega advertising producer Koji Ando about making the Segata Sanshiro commercials.

==&quot;Segata Sanshirō Shinken Yūgi&quot;==
 is a Sega Saturn video game based on the Segata Sanshiro advertisements. This game is a collection of minigames, with completing objectives in each one unlocking one of Segata&#x27;s television commercials for view. In one such minigame, Segata acts as Santa Claus and delivers presents to children while avoiding obstacles, while another was a game in the style of &quot;Columns&quot; with combos earned helping to keep Segata from drowning. Completing all ten of the minigames earns a message from Segata, as well as a music video. &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; Magazine gave the game an &quot;F&quot; rating, saying that the mini games are lame, and it would only be enjoyable if you got the game for free and enjoyed the character.

Retrospectively, &quot;Segata Sanshirō Shinken Yūgi&quot; is remembered for having captured the spirit of Segata Sanshiro and having a sense of humor consistent with the character but criticized for its simplicity and lack of engaging play. According to Brian Crimmins of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;, &quot;Sanshiro’s antic may not have offered Sega enough to work on, but more importantly, the developer didn’t consider what role play can have in facilitating humor... this is exactly the case with &quot;Shinken Yūgi&quot;: despite how consistent the humor is, the quality of the games themselves varies wildly.&quot; Crimmins also commented, however, that &quot;Shinken Yūgi&quot;&#x27;s best value was historical. When &quot;GamesTM&quot; interviewed Fujioka, they noted his reaction about the game indicated that he was happy that it was developed, but also aware that it was not of good quality.

== Legacy ==
The Sega Saturn sold 5.75 million units in Japan, surpassing the 3.58 million units of its predecessor, the Mega Drive, in the country. This amount of sales also surpassed Nintendo&#x27;s sales of 5.54 million units of the competitor Nintendo 64 and competed closely with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation. The Segata Sanshiro advertisements are given credit for helping to establish those sales, though Sega had failed to make the Saturn as successful in other regions. As a result of the campaign, Segata Sanshiro achieved a cult following in Japan.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; journalist Steve Thomason singled out Segata as the character he would most like to control in the Nintendo DSi game &quot;Photo Dojo&quot;. Thomason amended that &quot;it&#x27;s just a shame his greatest skill – throwing opponents to make them explode – couldn&#x27;t be translated to the game&quot;. Luke Plunkett of &quot;Kotaku&quot; called Segata the &quot;Greatest Video Game Ad Man Of Them All&quot; due to his strong personality citing examples such as how he yelled at children. Otaku USA referred to Segata as &quot;the man, the myth, the legend&quot; and praised his return in a concert from 2013. &quot;GamesTM&quot; noted the appeal of commercials was his &quot;hyper-dramatic reality in which Segata had scope to be active and heroic&quot;. Justin Towell of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; also liked the character but felt disappointed by how he stopped appearing in advertisements. Kevin Schiller of &quot;Game Revolution&quot; referred to Segata as one of the strongest points of &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;.

In 2012, Steve Lycett, executive producer of Sumo Digital, encouraged a fan-made poll on the SEGA Forums to determine which three SEGA characters the fans would like to see in &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot; as DLC (Downloadable Content). Out of the 28 SEGA characters chosen by the forum, Ryo Hazuki had the majority vote ranking 1st, while Hatsune Miku ranked 2nd, and Segata Sanshiro ranked 3rd. In a review of &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;, Martin Robinson of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; had expected to see Segata in the game given its multiple tributes to various Sega games.

<text>Nether Winchendon or Lower Winchendon is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is near the county boundary with Oxfordshire, about west of Aylesbury and north of Haddenham. In 2011 the parish had a population of 165. From 1974 to 2020 it was in Aylesbury Vale district.

The toponym &quot;Winchendon&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;hill at a bend&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records Winchendon as &quot;Wincandone&quot;.

==Nether Winchendon House==
Nether Winchendon House, a manor house in Nether Winchendon, built on the site of an Augustinian priory that was a daughter house of Notley Abbey in Long Crendon. Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford bought and largely remodelled the priory. The house and gardens are now open to the public and the house is noted for its interior. Nether Winchendon House also hosts weddings.

==Nether Winchendon in films and television==
Nether Winchendon has been a frequent setting for television and film production, including two &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episodes (as different houses); Lady Pat&#x27;s house in &quot;Forever Green&quot; and the BBC series &quot;Chef!&quot; starring Lenny Henry. St Nicholas&#x27; parish church was the setting for a baptism scene in the film &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, but can be seen only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD.

==Notable residents==
*Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet - as governor of the provinces of New Jersey and Massachusetts Bay, his uncompromising policies were instrumental in the events leading to the American Revolution.

<doc id="417983" wikidata="Q1126190" url="?curid=417983" title="Connected Device Configuration">
<text>The Connected Device Configuration (CDC) is a specification of a framework for Java ME applications describing the basic set of libraries and virtual-machine features that must be present in an implementation. The CDC is combined with one or more profiles to give developers a platform for building applications on embedded devices ranging from pagers up to set-top boxes. The CDC was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 36 (CDC 1.0.2) and JSR 218 (CDC 1.1.2).

==Typical requirements==
Devices that support CDC typically include a 32-bit CPU with about 2 MB of RAM, and 2.5 MB of ROM available for the Java application environment. The reference implementations for CDC profiles are based on Linux running on an Intel-compatible PC, and optimized implementations are available for a variety of other CPUs and operating systems.

==Profiles==
A profile is a set of APIs that support devices with different capabilities and resources within the CDC framework to provide a complete Java application environment. Three profiles are available, which build on each other incrementally and allow application developers to choose the appropriate programming model for a particular device.

===Foundation Profile===
This is the most basic of the CDC family of profiles. Foundation Profile is a set of Java APIs tuned for low-footprint devices that have limited resources that do not need a graphical user interface system. It provides a complete Java ME application environment for consumer products and embedded devices but without a standards-based GUI system. Version 1.1.2 is specified in JSR 219 and implements a subset of Java SE 1.4.2, including a set of security-related optional packages, such as Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE), and Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).

===Personal Basis Profile===
The Personal Basis Profile provides a superset of the Foundation Profile APIs and supports a similar set of devices, with lightweight graphical user interface requirements. A framework for building lightweight graphical user interface components is provided with support for some AWT classes. There are no heavyweight GUI components provided because these components assume the availability of a pointing device such as a mouse. The specification is described in JSR 217 and is used for products that require a standards-based graphical user interface but without full AWT compatibility. The Xlet application programming model is used for application development within this profile, including advanced content on Blu-ray discs conforming to the BD-J specification.

===Personal Profile===
The Personal Profile extends the Personal Basis Profile with a GUI toolkit based on AWT. It provides a complete Java ME application environment with full AWT support and is intended for higher end devices, such as PDAs, smart communicators, set-top boxes, game consoles, automobile dashboard electronics, and so on. This is the recommended profile for porting of legacy PersonalJava-based applications. The specification is described in JSR 62 and uses the Applet programming model for application development.

==Optional Packages==
CDC supports a number of optional packages that allow developers to access specific pieces of extra functionality within the restricted resource constraints of a Java ME device.
* The RMI Optional Package provides a subset of Java SE RMI for distributed-application and network communication.
* The JDBC Optional Package provides a subset of the JDBC 3.0 API for accessing data sources, including spreadsheets, flat files and relational databases.

<doc id="417987" wikidata="Q310966" url="?curid=417987" title="SeaQuest DSV">
<text>SeaQuest DSV (stylized as seaQuest DSV and also promoted as simply seaQuest) is an American science fiction television series created by Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon for NBC. It aired between 1993 and 1996. In its final season, it was renamed seaQuest 2032. Set in &quot;the near future&quot; (the year 2018 in the first season), &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; originally mixed high drama with realistic scientific fiction. The first two seasons star Roy Scheider as Captain Nathan Bridger, designer and commander of the eponymous naval submarine &quot;seaQuest&quot; DSV 4600, the ship prefix standing for &quot;deep-submergence vehicle&quot;.

Jonathan Brandis portrays Lucas Wolenczak, a teenaged computer genius placed aboard &quot;seaQuest&quot; by his father, and Stephanie Beacham portrayed Kristin Westphalen, the chief medical officer and head of the &quot;seaQuest&quot; science department. In the opening episode of the third season Bridger departed DSV 4600 and was replaced by Captain Oliver Hudson, played by Michael Ironside. Also present was a dolphin character called Darwin who, due to technological advances, was able to communicate with the crew. Steven Spielberg expressed interest in the project and served as one of the show&#x27;s executive producers during the first two seasons.

Production of the first season was marked by disputes between the producers, NBC and cast members, changes in the production staff, and an earthquake. The second season saw changes in the cast, as well as continued disputes between cast members and producers. The third season introduced a new lead actor and title. While initially popular, the series began to decline in ratings throughout its run and was abruptly canceled in the middle of its third season.

==Overview==

===Season 1===

The series follows the adventures of the high-tech submarine &quot;seaQuest&quot; DSV 4600, a deep-submergence vehicle operated by the United Earth Oceans Organization (UEO), a global coalition of up-world countries and undersea confederations, similar to the United Nations. The UEO was created following a major showdown of nations and confederations at the Livingston Trench in the North Atlantic Ocean that occurred circa 2018 as depicted in the pilot episode, &quot;To Be Or Not to Be&quot;, and it remained a recurring element for the duration of the series.

The &quot;seaQuest&quot; was designed by retired naval captain Nathan Bridger and built by NORPAC (a military organization mentioned in the pilot) and given as a loan to the UEO after its creation. The storyline begins in the year 2018, after mankind has exhausted almost all natural resources, except for the ones on the ocean floor. Many new colonies have been established there and it is the mission of the &quot;seaQuest&quot; and its crew to protect them from hostile nonaligned nations and to aid in mediating disputes as well as engage in undersea research, much of which was still in the preliminary stages when the show began production in 1993.

Bridger, though originally reluctant due to a promise he made with his wife after their son, Robert, was killed in a naval military action before her death, is convinced to return to the navy, under the auspices of the UEO, and assume command of the &quot;seaQuest&quot;. The first season&#x27;s storylines primarily dealt with plausible oceanographic research, environmental issues, political machinations of the world and the interpersonal relationships of the crew.

===Season 2===

In the first-season finale, Bridger sacrifices the &quot;seaQuest&quot; to prevent an ecological disaster and for a short time it was not known if the show would be renewed for another season. The series had suffered in the ratings, as it was pitted against &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; on CBS and &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; on ABC. When it was decided the show would return, NBC and Universal used this opportunity to change the show&#x27;s format, beginning by relocating the show&#x27;s production from Los Angeles to Orlando.

Several cast changes were also made as both Royce D. Applegate (Chief Petty Officer Manilow Crocker) and John D&#x27;Aquino (Krieg) were released by NBC as the network wanted a younger cast for the second season. D&#x27;Aquino returned for a guest appearance in the third season. Stacy Haiduk (Hitchcock) informed producers that she did not wish to relocate to Orlando for the second season, having just returned to Los Angeles after spending four years in Florida during the production of &quot;The Adventures of Superboy&quot;. Stephanie Beacham, who as Dr. Westphalen was one of the first season&#x27;s strongest characters, was also hesitant to relocate to Florida. Beacham also blamed continued disputes between the network and the show&#x27;s producers as a major reason why she did not return.

Joining the series for season two were Edward Kerr as Lieutenant James Brody, &quot;seaQuest&quot;″s weapons officer; Kathy Evison as Lieutenant Lonnie Henderson, ship&#x27;s helmsman; Rosalind Allen as Dr. Wendy Smith, the boat&#x27;s new chief medical officer; Michael DeLuise as Seaman Anthony Piccolo, an ex-convict who has genetically engineered gills and Peter DeLuise as Dagwood, a prototype genetically engineered life form (G.E.L.F. or &quot;dagger&quot;—a racial slur) who serves as &quot;seaQuest&quot;&#x27;s custodian. As the &quot;seaQuest&quot; itself was rebuilt in the storyline, it allowed for the sets to be redesigned for the new Florida location and a shortened version of the Emmy award winning main title theme was instituted as the series returned to the airwaves on September 18, 1994 with the two-hour television movie season premiere, &quot;Daggers&quot;.

NBC and the show&#x27;s producers also decided they wanted more traditionally science-fiction oriented episodes this season, a direction that was explored toward the end of the first season when &quot;seaQuest&quot; discovered a million-year-old alien ship entombed in the ocean floor in the episode &quot;Such Great Patience&quot;. The second season explored heavy science-fiction concepts such as genetic engineering, aliens, parapsychology, time travel and various &quot;monsters of the week&quot; (including killer plants, a giant fire-breathing worm, a prehistoric crocodile and an ancient demon.)

Roy Scheider was vocal in his anger at the show&#x27;s new direction. In an interview given during the second season, Scheider averred: &quot;It&#x27;s childish trash... I am very bitter about it. I feel betrayed... It&#x27;s (the new season) not even good fantasy. I mean, &quot;Star Trek&quot; does this stuff much better than we can do it. To me the show is now &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; meets &quot;Star Dreck&quot;.&quot; Scheider felt the series had strayed too far away from its premise, and that he &quot;became more of a combat commander than a scientific commander and I hadn&#x27;t signed up for that.&quot;

Scheider added that after moving production to Florida, the show was &quot;going to present human beings who had a life on land as well as on the boat... we&#x27;ve had one script that has done that (the episode &#x27;Vapors&#x27;),&quot; Scheider said. &quot;The other shows are Saturday afternoon 4 o&#x27;clock junk for children. Just junk—old, tired, time-warp robot crap,&quot; making reference to the much maligned episode &quot;Playtime.&quot;

As Scheider explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t do this kind of stuff... I said (to the production executives), &#x27;If I wanted to do the fourth generation of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, I would have signed up for it. I wouldn&#x27;t have done &quot;seaQuest&quot;. You guys have changed it from handball into field hockey and never even bothered to talk to me.&#x27;&quot; Scheider&#x27;s comments left him in trouble with some of the executive producers, including Patrick Hasburgh who, in reply, had strong words for Scheider as well: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry he is such a sad and angry man. &quot;seaQuest&quot; is going to be a terrific show, and he is lucky to be part of it.&quot;

By the end of season two, &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; was again suffering, partly attributed to a perceived decrease in the quality of the writing as well as preemptions by NBC due to sports coverage. The possibility of cancellation appeared likely but NBC kept the show in production after plans for a new series titled &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; to replace &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; were canceled. Producer Lee Goldberg claimed the new series was canceled because the premise was &quot;awful.&quot; The season finale, written as a possible series finale, involved the &quot;seaQuest&quot; and its crew being abducted by aliens and forced into a civil war on an alien world where the ship appeared to be destroyed and the crew presumed dead.

===Season 3===

Blaming continued disputes with producers and abandonment of the show&#x27;s original premise, Roy Scheider requested to be released from his contract with NBC. However, the network only partially agreed and demanded that Bridger would make several appearances throughout the third season. Edward Kerr had been very frustrated with the episode entitled &quot;Alone&quot; (Reportedly, Kerr hated the script so much that he left the set. Brody is absent from that episode) and also wished to exit the series in the third season, which is why his character was critically injured in the season finale, &quot;Splashdown&quot;.

NBC would only agree to release him from his contract if he continued to play Brody for a few episodes in the third season so his character could be killed off for more dramatic impact in the episode &quot;SpinDrift&quot;. Because of rescheduling, the episode &quot;Brainlock&quot;, with Brody still alive, aired after the character&#x27;s death. Rosalind Allen was released as Dr. Smith proved to be unpopular with the audience and because producers felt that her character&#x27;s telepathic abilities would not fit with the more serious tone planned for the new season.

Marco Sanchez (Chief Petty Officer Miguel Ortiz), who had requested to remain with the series, was also released after NBC decided it wanted the principal cast number dropped from ten to nine, leaving Jonathan Brandis (Lucas Wolenczak), Don Franklin (Commander Jonathan Ford), and Ted Raimi (Lieutenant Tim O&#x27;Neill) as the only three cast members who remained with the show since the first episode. The marine trivia presentations at the end of the show, formerly hosted by oceanographer Dr. Bob Ballard in the season one and the main cast excluding Scheider in season two, were dropped entirely. The show itself was renamed to &quot;seaQuest 2032&quot;, with the storyline pushed ahead ten years after the end of season two.
In the season premiere, the &quot;seaQuest&quot; reappears on Earth, its crew mostly intact, ten years after their abduction at the end of season two. Captain Bridger retires to raise his new grandson and Michael Ironside joins the cast as the more militaristic Captain Oliver Hudson. Originally, Ironside refused to take over from Scheider as star of the series. &quot;I saw so many problems that I couldn&#x27;t see where I&#x27;d be able to do the work I wanted to do.&quot; claimed Ironside. Also considered for the lead of the series was actor Jonathan Banks, who had previously appeared in the first season episode &quot;Whale Songs&quot; as radical environmentalist Maximilian Scully.

After weeks of negotiations where Ironside offered producers a number of changes to the storytelling structure of the series, which were agreed upon, he finally signed on. &quot;You won&#x27;t see me fighting any man-eating glowworms, rubber plants, 40-foot crocodiles and I don&#x27;t talk to Darwin.&quot; he said. Though not cast as the new lead of the series, Jonathan Banks reprised his character of Scully in the third season. Also joining the cast was Elise Neal as Lieutenant J.J. Fredericks, who served as &quot;seaQuest&quot;&#x27;s sub-fighter pilot.

Steering story lines back towards more reality-based themes, the third season attempted to blend the sense of the first season with some of the unique elements of the second season, while at the same time, pushing forward in an entirely new direction altogether as the UEO faces the threat of the Macronesian Alliance and the ever growing corporate conglomerate Deon International. The series was perceived as becoming much darker than it was in the previous two seasons, focusing less on science (as it had in the first season) and science fiction (as it had in the second season) and more on international politics. While these changes were met with mostly positive reactions, ratings continued to decline and NBC canceled the series after thirteen episodes. The 57th and final network airing of &quot;seaQuest 2032&quot; took place on June 9, 1996.

==Episodes==

During the first and second seasons, NBC aired the show on Sundays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time; however, the series was frequently preempted in the second season in favor of NBC Sports coverage. During the third season, NBC moved the show to Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. ET; &quot;seaQuest&quot; continued to face frequent preemptions in favor of sports coverage and other television specials. Several of the show&#x27;s producers, including Carleton Eastlake, believe these preemptions led to the show&#x27;s cancellation.

After cancellation, the series aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States, Horror Channel in the UK, in Canada and Network Ten in Australia.

==Production==
In October 1992, it was announced NBC had given a 22-episode order to &quot;Sea Quest&quot; which was co-created by Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon and Steven Spielberg. The budget for the first season was estimated to be around $30 million with Universal Television&#x27;s televisions ambitions for the series being to serve as part of a larger multimedia franchise Spielberg had been friends with Roy Scheider since he starred in &quot;Jaws&quot; and was instrumental in getting him as the lead in the series with Scheider saying of the experience &quot;“It’s the best part offered me this year. If it gets to be half as good as it reads — it will be wonderful. It’s time for a show like this on TV.

During development, the original title for the series was &quot;Deep Space&quot;, though this was changed after the announcement of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

Roy Scheider&#x27;s character was based on John C. Lilly and Bob Ballard, who was also the technical advisor for the series in the first season. Lilly was a pioneer researcher into the nature of consciousness using as his principal tools the isolation tank, dolphin communication and psychedelic drugs, sometimes in combination. He was a prominent member of the Californian counterculture of scientists, mystics and thinkers that arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Albert Hofmann, Gregory Bateson, Ram Dass, Timothy Leary, Werner Erhard, and Richard Feynman were all frequent visitors to his home. The character&#x27;s name, Nathan Hale Bridger, was in homage to Nathan Hale.

When producers began developing new characters for the second season, they named Lieutenant Brody after Police Chief Martin Brody, Roy Scheider&#x27;s character in the first two &quot;Jaws&quot; films. Ralph Willcox and Karen Fraction, who both became recurring guest stars in the third season, had previously appeared as different characters in the second. Despite the numerous cast changes, Jonathan Brandis appeared in every episode of the series, Don Franklin in all but one episode (&quot;And Everything Nice&quot;), and Ted Raimi in all but two episodes (&quot;Nothing But The Truth&quot; and &quot;The Siamese Dream&quot;).

Several of the cast&#x27;s family members were brought in to play characters, as well. Brenda King, Roy Scheider&#x27;s wife, portrayed Carol Bridger; Todd Allen, Rosalind Allen&#x27;s husband, portrayed Clay Marshall in &quot;The Siamese Dream&quot;; Michael and Peter DeLuise&#x27;s father, veteran actor Dom DeLuise, portrayed Nick Piccolo in &quot;Vapors&quot;. Several cast members also dabbled on the creative side of the show, as both Ted Raimi and Jonathan Brandis penned episodes during the second season. (Brandis wrote the aforementioned &quot;The Siamese Dream&quot; and Raimi, &quot;Lostland&quot;.) Conversely, Robert Engels, one of the show&#x27;s executive producers (and writer of two episodes, &quot;Greed For a Pirate&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;) during the first season, portrayed the recurring character Malcolm Lansdowne.

While in production, &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; won and was nominated for a number of awards. John Debney won the 1994 Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Main Title Theme Music&quot; for his composition of the &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; theme song and in 2000, it was named the 48th best theme song of all time by TV Guide. Don Davis also won an Emmy in 1995 for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series&quot; (Dramatic Underscore) for his score for the second season premiere, &quot;Daggers&quot;. Russ Mitchell Landau was also nominated for his work on the third season premiere, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, in 1996. Kenneth D. Zunder was nominated for the Emmy award for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a Series&quot; for the episode &quot;Such Great Patience&quot;. Jonathan Brandis won the 1994 Young Artist Award for &quot;Best Youth Actor Leading Role in a Television Series&quot; for his portrayal of Lucas Wolenczak and the series was nominated for a 1994 ASC Award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Movies of the Week/Pilots&quot; as well as the Saturn Award for &quot;Best Genre Television Series&quot; in 1995.

A &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; feature film was in pre-production stages, however, it never materialized.

Despite being scripted in at least one episode, Captain Bridger never refers to Dagwood by name. The closest he ever got was calling him &quot;Dag&quot; in the episodes &quot;Special Delivery&quot; and &quot;The Siamese Dream&quot;.

Despite popular belief, Darwin was not a real dolphin but rather an animatronic animal designed and created by Walt Conti, who had created other similar effects for films such as &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;Free Willy.&quot; Alien creature effects were designed and created by Tony Gardner&#x27;s Alterian, Inc.

==Home media==
In 2005, Universal announced that the first season of &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; would be released on Region 1 DVD along with a week-long marathon of the show on the Sci Fi Channel.

As opposed to the first season, the second season was released on eight single-sided discs and does not contain any extra features such as deleted scenes. The third season was not released on DVD in region 1 but was released in Region 4 in 2011.

On May 6, 2019 Mediumrare Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 2 however two episodes are missing, &#x27;Dagger Redux&#x27; and &#x27;The Siamese Dream&#x27; instead two episodes from the previous disc are overlapped in their place. Despite this, the correct episode titles are listed in the DVD menu.

Mill Creek Entertainment announced the complete series of SeaQuest DSV on Blu-ray was released on July 19, 2022.

===Soundtrack album===

John Debney composed the original theme music and scored the pilot and season one shows, with Don Davis working on season two. When the series was revamped as &quot;SeaQuest 2032&quot; in the final season, Russ Landau composed a new theme and scored all the episodes. In 1995, Varèse Sarabande released an album of Debney&#x27;s music from the show, featuring the series main and end title themes and selections from &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (tracks 2-8), &quot;Knight of Shadows&quot; (tracks 9 and 10) and &quot;Such Great Patience&quot; (tracks 11-13). In 2020, the label released a 2-CD expansion, with music from &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; on disc 1.

<doc id="417988" wikidata="Q1023837" url="?curid=417988" title="Connected Limited Device Configuration">
<text>The Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) is a specification of a framework for Java ME applications describing the basic set of libraries and virtual-machine features that must be present in an implementation. The CLDC is combined with one or more profiles to give developers a platform for building applications on embedded devices with very limited resources such as pagers and mobile phones. The CLDC was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 30 (CLDC 1.0) and JSR 139 (CLDC 1.1).

==Typical requirements==
CLDC is designed for devices that have limited processing power, memory, and graphical capability. Devices typically have the following features:
* 16-bit or 32-bit CPU with a clock speed of 16 MHz or higher
* At least 160 KB ROM allocated for the CLDC libraries and virtual machine
* At least 8 KB total RAM available to the Java platform
* Low power consumption, often operating on battery power
* Connectivity to some kind of network, often with a wireless, intermittent connection and limited bandwidth

==Noteworthy limitations==
Compared to the Java SE environment, several APIs are absent entirely, and some APIs are altered such that code requires explicit changes to support CLDC. In particular, certain changes are not just the absence of classes or interfaces, but actually change the signatures of existing classes in the base class library. An example of this is the absence of the codice_1 interface, which does not appear in the base class library due to restrictions on reflection usage. All codice_2 classes which normally implement codice_1 do not, therefore, implement this tagging interface.

Other examples of limitations depend on the version being used, as some features were re-introduced with version 1.1 of CLDC.

===CLDC 1.0 and 1.1===
* The codice_1 interface is not supported.
* Parts of the reflection capabilities of the Java standard edition:
** The codice_5 package and any of its classes not supported.
** Methods on codice_6 which obtain Constructors or Methods or Fields.
* No finalization. CLDC does not include the codice_7 method.
* Limited error handling. Non-runtime errors are handled by terminating the application or resetting the device.
* No user-defined class loaders
* No thread groups or daemon threads.

==Profiles==
A profile is a set of APIs that support devices with different capabilities and resources within the CLDC framework to provide a complete Java application environment. There are specific profiles for devices ranging from vending machines to set-top boxes, with the mobile phone profile MIDP being the most prevalent.

===Mobile Information Device Profile===
The Mobile Information Device Profile is a profile designed for cell phones. There are two versions of MIDP available, specified in JSR 37 (MIDP 1.0) and JSR 118 (MIDP 2.0). Both versions provide an LCD oriented GUI API, with MIDP 2.0 including a basic 2D gaming API. Applications written to use this profile are called MIDlets. Many cell phones come with a MIDP implementation, and it is a popular platform for downloadable cell phone games.

=== Information Module Profile ===
The Information Module Profile is specified in JSR 195 and is designed for vending machines, network cards, routers, telephone boxes and other systems with either simple or no display and some form of limited two way network access. Only APIs for application creation, storage, and network access are defined. These are a subset of the javax.microedition.io, rms and midlet packages in MIDP. Siemens Mobile and Nokia put forward this specification to the JCP.

===DoJa Profile===
The DoJa profile was designed for the i-mode mobile phone by NTT DoCoMo.

===Digital Set Top Box Profile===
The Digital Set Top Box profile, specified in JSR 242, is designed for the cable market. Also referred to as OnRamp, this profile is based on a subset of the OpenCable Application Platform (&quot;OCAP&quot;), which defines a set of APIs for the development of applications for set-top boxes and similar devices. The profile consists of subsets from the CDC Personal Basis Profile including support for AWT, Xlet, file access, and network APIs, as well as several media-related interfaces from OCAP. The whole profile encompassed 31 Java packages and approximately 1500 APIs.

==Optional Packages==
The PDA Optional Packages are specified in JSR-75 and are designed for PDAs such as Palm or Windows CE devices.
The specification defines two independent packages that represent important features found on many PDAs and other mobile devices. These packages are:
* Personal Information Management (PIM) which gives devices access to personal information management data contained in address books, calendars, and to-do lists.
* FileConnection (FC) which allows access to file systems and removable storage devices, such as external memory cards.

==General APIs==
; codice_8: A streamlined version of the java.io package found in the standard edition for doing Input/Output operations.
; codice_9: Contains classes that are essential to the Java language. This package contains standard java types like Integers and Strings as well as basic exceptions, math functions, system functions, threading and security functions.
; codice_10: A streamlined version of the codice_10 collection library. This package contains the collection classes like Vector and Hashtable. It also contains calendar and date class.

<text>Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning is a public college located in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
In 1967, the college was founded as Conestoga College of Applied Arts and Technology by the government of Ontario to grant diplomas and certificates in career-related, skills-oriented programs.

The college started to offer degree programs in B.Eng. Mechanical Systems Engineering and B.A. Tech Architecture - Project and Facility Management starting in August 2003, and B.A. Tech in Integrated Telecommunication and Computer Technology in 2007.

Corruption in Canadian Higher-Education that saw Canadian institutions abandoning academic ethics and standards to enroll foreign students was noted in 2016. Conestoga faculty began reporting widespread cheating and fraud dating back to at least 2019. The early 2020s saw 70% to 81% of Conestoga&#x27;s enrollees as international students, most commonly from India, and a 1,579% increase in international student population since 2014. Its total revenue increased over $137 million year over year. 

By 2023, Conestoga College accounted for 30,395 international study permits, more than twice as many as any other post-secondary institution in Canada. In October federal Minister of Immigration Marc Miller threatened a federal crack down on Canadian post secondary institutions operating as &quot;bad actors&quot; if they did not clean up their act. President John Tibbits responded claiming Conestoga was &quot;unfairly grouped&quot; with &quot;bad actors in the sector.&quot; In November Cambridge MP Bryan May publicly criticized Conestoga saying &quot;They are exploiting these students.&quot; Reports of increased use of local food banks by Conestoga college and other students continued. 

In January 2024, at a public event, Conestoga president John Tibbits called fellow Sault College president David Orazietti &quot;a whore&quot; in reference to enrolment practices. In February union locals called for Tibbits to resign. In March, Conestoga College was criticized by the Minister of Immigration over its practice of foreign enrolment. In April Orazietti filed a $200K defamation lawsuit against Conestoga and it&#x27;s president. Public criticism of Conestoga&#x27;s business practices came also from their own staff. The following month Conestoga announced they were offering 160 employees early retirement in December 2024 in an effort to cut costs following decreased international student demand. 

In March 2024, it was reported the college was expected to lose over half of its current international students. In April college staff, faculty and students went public with concerns citing a lack of fundamental skills among those admitted and students who struggle to make ends meet while the college posted a surplus of over $100 million in 2022-23. In August of 2024 Conestoga defended running a 2023-24 surplus of over a quarter billion dollars. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized colleges of profiting from high enrolment of foreign students in November, Conestoga declined to respond to his comments. Immigration Minister Marc Miller called out Conestoga saying that making $100 million dollar surplus &quot;isn&#x27;t the vocation of a college. In December it was reported that 550 Conestoga students had made asylum claims. Canadian colleges working with recruiting entities in India processing tens of thousands of student visas have been implicated in human trafficking by Indian authorities. Conestoga paid $20 million in commissions to international recruitment agencies in 2019-20.

==Academic program==
Conestoga has one, two, three, or four-year programs, as well as apprenticeship training programs. There are also many options available to students including four-year degrees in Mechanical Systems Engineering, Integrated Telecommunications and Computer Technology, Architecture, Health Informatics or the International Business Management degree which started in the fall of 2006. Conestoga staff and local politicians have been critical of international student enrollment in business programs.

===Trades and apprenticeship===
The college operates trades programs at the campuses in Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge and Guelph; training facilities are operated in Brantford and Ingersoll. The school&#x27;s programs include Construction, Motive Power, Industrial and Service sectors, as well as Traditional Apprenticeship and, most recently, Pre-apprenticeship, offered in partnership with private enterprise companies. The college&#x27;s president revealed a plan in late 2019 to consolidate all of the trades programs at one location in future, but the date of the move was not disclosed at that time.

==Campuses==

Doon Campus is the main campus for Conestoga College. It is located at the south end of Kitchener and houses the central administration offices as well as the majority of courses offered by the college. Regional campuses have select programs.

# Brantford: 274 Colborne St.
# Cambridge: 850 Fountain St. South, 25 Reuter Drive
# Guelph: 460 Speedvale Ave. West
# Ingersoll: 420 Thomas St.
# Kitchener: 299 Doon Valley Drive (Doon Campus), 49 Frederick St. (downtown)
# Milton: 8160 Parkhill Dr., 433 Steeles Ave. East
# Stratford: 130 Youngs St.
# Waterloo: 108 University Av. East

===Planned Milton Campus===
The town of Milton and Wilfrid Laurier University had been working together since 2008 to develop the campus in Milton within the planned Milton Education Village (MEV) on of land donated by the town. The university subsequently partnered with Conestoga College which would also add a satellite campus at that location.

In April 2018, the Province announced a funding plan of $90 million for the project. Construction of the campus was expected to conclude in Q3 of 2021; in the meantime, the college would offer courses in rented premises, commencing in September 2019.

In October 2018, however, the new provincial government (elected in June 2018) withdrew the funding before any construction had begun, citing a greater than expected provincial deficit. This effectively cancelled the plans for the joint project with Laurier. Mayor Gord Krantz said the town would explore alternatives for funding the Milton Education Village campus. A news release issued by the college said that it would continue working with Laurier, &quot;the government, industry and community partners to develop a revised model for the cost-effective delivery of post-secondary education ... in Milton...&quot;

===Cambridge expansion===
The college decided to purchase of land in this city in 2019, to relocate all of the trades programs (offered at various campuses) to Cambridge at a future date. Specifics were not immediately provided at the time of the announcement in late 2019. The new campus opened in Fall 2022 on of land at Reuter Drive, next to Highway 401. The college aims to modernize and consolidate all skilled trades programs in this single location.

===Planned Guelph expansion===
The college has operated a small campus in Guelph for some years, but in late 2019, it advised the news media that a major expansion was planned after the trades program was relocated to Cambridge. &quot;Within five or six years, we will have at least 5,000 students there ... [with] full-service programming,&quot; said college President John Tibbits. At the time, the Guelph campus had approximately 1,000 students.

In 2023, the college announced it would be purchasing a soon-to-be vacant building in downtown Guelph, with the first phase of a new campus scheduled to open in 2025. At full capacity, the new downtown Guelph campus will have approximately 5,000 students.

===Other buildings===

*Recreation Centre
*ATS Centre
*Woodworking Centre of Ontario

===Future===
The School of Engineering and Information Technology was relocated, in 2011, to a new expansion of the Doon campus opposite the current facility across Highway 401. This City of Cambridge site will eventually hold of space.

Phase one of the new Cambridge Campus was finished and open for the start of the fall 2011 semester. building is home to the School of Engineering and Information Technology, as well as to the Institute for Food Processing Technology. The Engineering facility has programs with a focus on advanced manufacturing, robotics, renewable energy, telecommunications, and information technology. The expansion has increased capacity by 2,350 additional full-time spaces and allowed for an additional 800 new spaces for apprentices.

In May 2019, a new downtown campus for the International Business program was announced to be opening at Kitchener&#x27;s Market Square in January 2020. It will host 1,000 students to start.

==Residences==

Conestoga&#x27;s Kitchener - Conestoga College Blvd. residence is close to the Kitchener - Doon and Cambridge - Fountain Street campuses. Scheduled to open in fall 2023, the Waterloo - University Ave. residence is close to the Waterloo campus and a short drive to the Kitchener - Downtown campus. Despite the international student body at Conestoga College increasing by 1579%, on-campus student housing does not meet the demand of enrolled students resulting in many students struggling to find housing in the region.

==Student Life Centre==

===Student media===
*88.3 CJIQ is the college&#x27;s campus radio station. It is used as part of the Broadcasting: Radio course and Journalism program.
*&quot;Conestoga Connected&quot; is a weekly half-hour newsmagazine all about Conestoga College student programs, news, events, innovations, sports, life off-campus and alumni. It is created and produced by second-year Broadcast Television students.

<doc id="417992" wikidata="Q4943853" url="?curid=417992" title="Bootable business card">
<text>A bootable business card (BBC) is a CD-ROM that has been cut, pressed, or molded to the size and shape of a business card (designed to fit in a wallet or pocket). Alternative names for this form factor include &quot;credit card&quot;, &quot;hockey rink&quot;, and &quot;wallet-size&quot;. The cards are designed to hold about 50 MB. The CD-ROM business cards are generally used for commercial product demos, are mailed to prospective customers, and are given away at trade shows.

Although the term &quot;bootable business card&quot; could be applied to any bootable CD-ROM in the business card form factor, it almost always refers to one which contains a compact Linux distribution generally containing a suite of system diagnostic and rescue tools and/or demos of specific packages. Although Damn Small Linux (2012-2014) did managed to fit an everyday desktop operating system on a bootable business card. 

==History==
In 1999 Linuxcare employee Duncan MacKinnon proposed the idea of producing and distributing such a card for an upcoming tradeshow. He and his team of volunteers (fellow employees) coined the phrase &quot;bootable business card&quot;.

The premiere version was available at the first LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, California. The initial press run produced 10,000 copies. Most of those were given away at the show and shipped to Linux users groups in the ensuing months.

Since the project consisted of open source and free software, and the idea was compelling and simple, a number of other Linux BBCs rapidly became available.

The first derivative was produced by the Irish Linux Users Group. Over the years, most of the creators of the original Linuxcare BBC left the company, but have continued to work on the project which is now called the LNX-BBC.

At least one of the boxed Red Hat Linux packages included a system rescue CD in business card form factor.

Many derivatives and clones of the BBC have proliferated. Almost all of these run on PCs. Limited success has been achieved on BBCs and Live CDs on other computing platforms.

The early versions of the Linuxcare BBC were collections of packages that had been precompiled for other distributions (such as Debian and Red Hat Linux from which subsets of files were copied into the directory from which the BBC was &quot;mastered&quot; (the ISO 9660 CD images were built).

Building the entire mini-distribution from source code was the major undertaking of the LNX-BBC project (which formed of the original Linuxcare members with other contributors and volunteers). The first version of the LNX-BBC that was independent from Linuxcare was 1.618 (a number suggested by team member Seth Schoen, an approximation of the golden ratio, or phi (φ), and a tribute to Donald Knuth who uses successively more precise approximations of π for versioning his TeX typesetting system).

Beginning with version 2.0, all LNX-BBC discs are built entirely from source code using the GAR system.
This version was used by the Free Software Foundation as their membership card (given sponsoring members for their donations).

More recently, the 50 MB Damn Small Linux can be put on BBCs. There have also been &quot;BBC&quot; releases of other free operating systems such as FreeBSD.

==Operation==
The key of the bootable business card is that it runs completely from the CD and the system&#x27;s memory (RAM), as several &quot;Live&quot; CD versions of Linux have been doing for years. One simply puts the CD into the drive, powers up the computer and ensures that the CD drive is selected for boot before the hard drive.

Once booted, the operating system runs from the CD and out of the system&#x27;s RAM. Because the business card form factor has such a small capacity the Linuxcare developers typically choose to use a compressed filesystem. This allows the typical BBC to contain about 100 megabytes of software in only about 50 megabytes of disc space.

The original BBC and most of its clones and derivatives will scan the system for recognized filesystems, automatically &quot;mounting&quot; these up in read-only mode. This makes filesystems on any local hard disks accessible while minimizing the risk of inadvertent corruption, deletion or other damage to files on local drives.

A typical BBC contains a suite of networking, back-up and data recovery utilities, which is why they are valued by Linux system administrators as rescue tools.

Many BBCs use the cloop (compressed loopback) driver which provided a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. Of course they typically have some of the system&#x27;s memory (RAM) configured as a ramdisk (or perhaps several RAM disks). This typically leaves the CD-ROM drive dedicated for the duration of the system usage. However, some BBCs create a larger ramdisk and copy the entire system off the CD, thus making the drive available for other CDs or DVDs. This is useful because some PCs have only a single CD or DVD drive.

Once booted, these systems provide a UNIX/Linux command line prompt (generally as the root user). Some also provide some very compact graphical user interface (GUI) tools. The LNX-BBC includes a small X (X Window System) server and a web browser called BrowseX (among other tools).

At their core most BBCs are rescue and diagnostics tools for expert professionals, and normal user-operations are catered for better by Live CD distributions.

==Alternatives==
A number of Linux distributions run from Live CDs, operating in a similar manner to a bootable business card, notably including the Knoppix and Ubuntu distributions. Similarly, Linux distributions can often be configured to run from a USB flash drive, or a similar medium, such as a floppy disk. Some can be booted over a network.

==Risks==
Bootable business cards may hold malware as bootable media is an easy way for malware to infect a system and unsuspecting users are easily tempted by their novelty. It is also difficult for the average user to determine their contents before booting.

Born in Cypress River, Manitoba, Young grew up in nearby Glenboro, Manitoba, where his father, Percy Andrew Young, owned a drug store. His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson. After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to Winnipeg, but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler.

Young began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the Winnipeg Free Press and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow &quot;Rassy&quot; Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940.

==Moves to Toronto==
Unable to get a raise at the &quot;Free Press&quot;, Young moved to Toronto in 1941, covering news and sports for the Canadian Press news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover World War II for CP. He came back a year later and joined the Royal Canadian Naval Reserves, where he served as a Communications Officer until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, Neil Young, was born in Toronto in November 1945.

Young began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. He quit his job at &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in 1948 to write short stories full-time.

In 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario, near Peterborough. The family&#x27;s finances would vary with Young&#x27;s success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot; His first novel &quot;The Flood&quot; was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia. Soon after, he and Edna separated. Following Young&#x27;s divorce in 1961, he married Mead. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962.

He was also a host on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John W. H. Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC&#x27;s sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.

==Life on the farm==
In 1967, Young bought a farm near Omemee in Cavan Township and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the &quot;Globe&quot;&#x27;s news bureau in Ottawa. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with Punch Imlach. The rights had been acquired by the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot;, but the &quot;Globe&quot; wouldn&#x27;t allow Young&#x27;s writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the &quot;Globe&quot; and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the &quot;Telegram&quot;, moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the &quot;Telegram&quot; until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;. Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow &quot;Globe&quot; writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the &quot;Globe&quot; over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit. He worked with former Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe on Smythe&#x27;s autobiography, which would be published after Smythe&#x27;s death in November 1980.

In 1980s, he wrote a series of detective stories that featured Inuit detective Matthew &quot;Matteesie&quot; Kitologitak, including &quot;The Shaman&#x27;s Knife&quot; and &quot;Murder in A Cold Climate&quot;.

In 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association. He was later inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.

Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of North Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university&#x27;s archives. The Youngs returned to Omemee in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Life&quot;, was published in 1994.

He wrote a book on his life with his son Neil, &quot;Neil and Me&quot;, in 1984.

He and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2004, where he died the following year at age 87.

<text>Śrem () is a town on the Warta river in central Poland. It is the seat of Śrem County in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. As of 1995, the population of Śrem was 29,800.

Śrem is to the south of Poznań, a local road junction on the road from Poznań to Rawicz; other roads lead from the town to Września, Leszno and Głuchowo. The Śrem District has a population of 39,672, of which about 31,000 live in the town of Śrem.

==History==

Śrem was founded in the second half of the 10th century in the cradle of the emerging Polish state, when a fortified settlement, which protected the ford across the Warta on an important trade route from Silesia to Poznań, was erected on the right bank of the Warta river, and soon a trade settlement developed on the left bank. It is numbered among the oldest Lechitic settlements. Śrem received municipal rights from dukes Bolesław the Pious and Przemysł I of Greater Poland in 1253, the same year as Poznań.

Śrem developed rapidly and in the 14th century, it became a royal town of the Polish Crown and the seat of local royal officials (&quot;starosta&quot;). Administratively it was located in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Its heyday was in the first half of the 15th century and the second half of the 16th century. Later, lengthy wars, epidemics and natural catastrophes caused Śrem to decline, like many other towns in the Greater Poland region. In the late 18th century, Józef Wybicki, Polish jurist, poet, political and military activist, best known as the author of the lyrics of the Polish national anthem, settled in nearby Manieczki, and in 1791 became a burgher and honorary citizen of Śrem.

The town was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, regained by Poles and included in the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, re-annexed by Prussia in 1815, and from 1871 it was part of Germany. Despite the influx of German officials, Śrem remained a typical Polish town. During the Greater Poland uprising (1848), a hospital for Polish insurgents was established in the town, and in the following decades the town remained a center of Polish resistance, and Poles established various organizations and enterprises. After World War I Poland regained independence in November 1918, and the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19) broke out, during which in December 1918, the local German garrison surrendered without resistance and the town was finally restored to the Second Polish Republic. In the interbellum new factories were opened and new housing districts were built.

Śrem was bombed by Germany on 1 September 1939, the first day of the invasion of Poland, which began World War II. During the German occupation, the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, imprisonment, executions, expulsions, and deportations to Nazi concentration camps. In September 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; carried out mass arrests of Poles, many of whom were immediately murdered. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; carried out public executions of Poles from Śrem and nearby villages on 20 September and 20 October 1939, killing 20 and 19 people respectively, including former Polish insurgents of 1918–1919, local administration and court officials, merchants, and landowners. The Polish resistance movement was quickly organized in the town, incl. the &quot;Dla Ciebie Polsko&quot; (&quot;For You, Poland&quot;) organization founded by a local teacher in October 1939, and later also the Home Army. 12 Poles arrested in Śrem were executed in the nearby village of Zbrudzewo on 8 November 1939. Further mass arrests of 45 Poles, mostly teachers, were carried out in May 1940, and most were then deported to the Mauthausen and Dachau concentration camps, and murdered there. In 1939 and 1940, the Germans expelled hundreds of Poles, who were deported to the General Government in the more-eastern part of German-occupied Poland, and their houses were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. After the end of German occupation, the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively part of the Poznań Voivodeship. In August 1980, employees of local factories joined the nationwide anti-communist strikes, which led to the foundation of the Solidarity organization, which played a central role in the end of communist rule in Poland.

==Economy==
At present, the town has a population of about 30,000, with a fast-developing economy. It is the seat of many firms with private and foreign capital, which have invested in metallurgy, furniture production, transport, window and door production, textiles and food processing. The Śrem Iron Foundry is the biggest plant in Śrem and Śrem County. Business activity in the area is supported by such institutions as the Craftsmen&#x27;s Guild, the Śrem Centre for Support of Small Business, and the County Branch of the Wielkopolska Chamber of Industry and Commerce.

==Attractions==
For attractions, promoters cite the scenery, palaces and manors with surrounding parks, domestic and religious architecture, as well as nature sanctuaries. Infrastructure includes accommodation, restaurants, and sports and leisure facilities (see below).

Śrem is also the seat of education facilities: vocational and secondary schools as well as a branch of Adam Mickiewicz University of Poznań. The branch offers Bachelor of Science courses in material chemistry and tourism. In addition, there are cultural institutions such as the Śrem Museum, the public library, the Culture Centre, and local media including the press, television.

There are also monuments to notable people connected with Śrem, including Józef Wybicki and Piotr Wawrzyniak, and memorials to the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19) participants and the victims of World War II.

==Sports==

<text>Irradiated mail is mail that has been deliberately exposed to radiation, typically in an effort to disinfect it. The most notable instance of mail irradiation in the US occurred in response to the 2001 anthrax attacks; the level of radiation chosen to kill anthrax spores was so high that it often changed the physical appearance of the mail. 

The United States Postal Service began to irradiate mail in November 2001, in response to the discovery of large-scale contamination at several of its facilities that handled the letters that were sent in the attacks.

A facility in Bridgeport, New Jersey, operated by Sterigenics International, uses a Rhodotron continuous wave electron beam accelerator built by IBA Industrial, to irradiate the mail. A few facilities were planning to use cobalt-60 sources, though it is unclear whether this was ever done.

==Effect on mail==
The USPS warned that a number of products could be adversely affected, such as seeds, photographic film, biological samples, food, medicines, and electronic equipment. In the process of irradiation, mail is exposed to extreme heat. Paper is weakened and may appear to have been aged, with discoloration (e.g., yellowing), and brittleness. Pages may break, crumble, or fuse to other pages. Documents bound with glue may have loose pages. The printing on pages may be distorted or offset onto adjacent pages. If tape is affixed to address labels, the address may be illegible.

Irradiation&#x27;s effects on paper caused some alarm in the philatelic world, which sends large numbers of rare postage stamps and covers through the mail. A number of auction houses stopped sending material through the mail, and &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News&quot; in 2002 featured reports on stamps and covers that had been ruined by irradiation.

Although at one time the USPS expected to irradiate all mail, it later scaled back to just treating mail sent to government offices, including all mail directed to the White House, Congress, and the Library of Congress.

<doc id="418001" wikidata="Q164669" url="?curid=418001" title="10th Mountain Division">
<text>The 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) is a light infantry division in the United States Army based at Fort Drum, New York. Formerly designated as a mountain warfare unit, the division was the only one of its size in the U.S. military to receive specialized training for fighting in mountainous conditions. More recently, the 10th Mountain has advised and assisted Iraqi Security Forces in Iraq and People&#x27;s Defense Units in Syria.

Originally activated as the 10th Light Division (Alpine) in 1943, the division was redesignated the 10th Mountain Division in 1944 and fought in the mountains of Italy in some of the roughest terrain in World War II. On 5 May 1945, the division reached Nauders, Austria, just beyond the Reschen Pass, where it made contact with German forces being pushed south by the U.S. Seventh Army. A status quo was maintained until the enemy headquarters involved had completed their surrender to the Seventh. On 6 May, 10th Mountain troops met the 44th Infantry Division of Seventh Army.

Following the war, the division was deactivated, only to be reactivated and redesignated as the 10th Infantry Division in 1948. The division first acted as a training division and, in 1954, was converted to a full combat division and sent to Germany before being deactivated again in 1958.

Reactivated again in 1985, the division was designated the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) to historically tie it to the World War II division and to also better describe its modern disposition. Since its reactivation, the division or elements of the division have deployed numerous times. The division has participated in Operation Desert Storm (Saudi Arabia), Hurricane Andrew disaster relief (Homestead, Florida), Operation Restore Hope and Operation Continue Hope (Somalia), Operation Uphold Democracy (Haiti), Operation Joint Forge (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Operation Joint Guardian (Kosovo), and several deployments as part of the Multinational Force and Observers (Sinai Peninsula).

Since 2002, the 10th Mountain Division has been the most deployed regular Army unit. Its combat brigades have seen over 20 deployments, to both Iraq and Afghanistan, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

== History ==

===Genesis of U.S. mountain troops===

In November 1939, two months after World War II broke out in Europe, during the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Finland, Red Army efforts were frustrated following the destruction of two armored divisions by Finnish soldiers on skis. The conflict caught global attention as the outnumbered and outgunned Finnish soldiers were able to use the difficult local terrain to their advantage, severely hampering the Soviet attacks and embarrassing their military. Upon seeing the effectiveness of these troops, Charles Minot &quot;Minnie&quot; Dole, the president of the National Ski Patrol, began to lobby the War Department of the need for a similar unit of troops in the United States Army, trained for fighting in winter and mountain warfare. In September 1940, Dole was able to present his case to General George C. Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, who agreed with Dole&#x27;s assessment, deciding to create a &quot;Mountain&quot; unit for fighting in harsh terrain. The U.S. Army authorized the formation of the platoon-sized Army Ski Patrol in November 1940. The first Patrol was formed at Camp Murray as part of the 41st Infantry Division under Lt. Ralph S. Phelps (later to become commanding General of the 41st). The army, prompted by fears that its standing force would not perform well in the event of a winter attack on the Northeastern coast, as well as knowledge that the German Army already had three mountain warfare divisions known as Gebirgsjäger, approved the concept for a division. This required an overhaul of U.S. military doctrine, as the concept of winter warfare had not been tested in the army since 1914. At first, planners envisioned ten mountain divisions, but personnel shortages revised the goal to three. Eventually, the 10th Mountain Division would be the only one brought to active duty. Military leaders continued to express concern about the feasibility of a division-sized mountain warfare unit until the fall of 1941, when they received reports that Greek mountain troops had held back superior numbers of unprepared Italian troops in the Albanian mountains during the Greco-Italian War. The Italian military had lost a disastrous 25,000 men in the campaign because of their lack of preparedness to fight in the mountains. On 22 October 1941, General Marshall decided to form the first battalion of mountain warfare troops for a new mountain division. The Ski Patrol would assist in its training.

On 8 December 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent American entry into World War II, the army activated its first mountain unit, the 87th Mountain Infantry Battalion (which was later expanded to the 87th Infantry Regiment) at Fort Lewis, Washington, south of Tacoma. It was the first mountain warfare unit in U.S. military history. The National Ski Patrol took on the unique role of recruiting for the 87th Infantry Regiment and later the division, becoming the only civilian recruiting agency in military history. Army planners favored recruiting experienced skiers for the unit instead of trying to train standing troops in mountain warfare, so Dole recruited from schools, universities, and ski clubs for the unit. The 87th trained in harsh conditions, including Mount Rainier&#x27;s peak, throughout 1942 as more recruits were brought in to form the division. Initial training was conducted by Olympian Rolf Monsen. A new garrison was built for the division in central Colorado at Camp Hale, at an elevation of above sea level.

=== World War II ===
The 10th Light Division (Alpine) was constituted on 10 July 1943 and activated five days later at Camp Hale under the command of Brigadier General Lloyd E. Jones, with Brigadier General Frank L. Culin Jr. assigned as his assistant division commander (ADC). The 10th Light Division was centered on regimental commands; the 85th, 86th, and 87th Infantry Regiments. At the time, the division had a strength of 8,500 out of the 16,000 planned, so the military transferred troops from the 30th, 31st, and 33rd Infantry Divisions along with volunteers from the National Guards of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah and Washington (specifically, men who were from the Rocky Mountain and northern states, close to the 45th parallel north), to fill out the remainder of the division. This lowered morale, and the division faced many difficulties in the new training, which had no established army doctrine. Also assigned to the division were the 604th, 605th, and 616th Field Artillery Battalions, the 110th Signal Company, the 710th Ordnance Company, the 10th Quartermaster Company, the 10th Reconnaissance Troop, the 126th Engineer Battalion, the 10th Medical Battalion, and the 10th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment. The 10th Light Division was unique in that it was the only division in the army with three field artillery battalions instead of four. It was equipped with vehicles specialized in snow operation, such as the M29 Weasel, and winter weather gear, such as white camouflage and skis specifically designed for the division. 

The division practiced its rock climbing skills in preparation for the invasion of Italy on the challenging peaks of Seneca Rocks in West Virginia. Its specialized training culminated with what were known as the &quot;D-Series&quot; (&quot;D&quot; for &quot;Divisional&quot;), military maneuvers on the divisional level in the Colorado Rockies in Winter conditions. Beginning 26 March 1944, the exercises were intended to last five weeks. The soldiers endured an adverse environment, and &quot;tactical conditions&quot; that banned open fires in sub-zero temperatures. As a result the exercises were ended after 3 weeks. Official statistics recorded 195 cases of frostbite and 340 other incapacitating injuries.

On 22 June 1944, the division was shipped to Camp Swift, Texas, to prepare for maneuvers in Louisiana, which were later canceled. A period of acclimation to a low altitude and hot climate was thought necessary to prepare for this training. On 6 November 1944, the 10th Division was redesignated the 10th Mountain Division. That same month, the blue and white &quot;Mountain&quot; tab was authorized for the division&#x27;s new shoulder sleeve insignia. Also in November, the division received a new commander, Brigadier General George Price Hays, a Medal of Honor recipient and a distinguished veteran of World War I. On January 4, 1945 he received a promotion to major general.

==== Italy ====
The division sailed for the Italian front in two parts, with the 86th Infantry and support leaving Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on 11 December 1944 aboard the SS &quot;Argentina&quot; and arriving in Naples, Italy on 22 December. The 85th and 87th Infantry left Hampton Roads, Virginia on 4 January 1945 aboard the SS &quot;West Point&quot; and arrived on 13 January 1945. By 6 January, its support units were preparing to head to the front lines. It was attached to Major General Willis D. Crittenberger&#x27;s IV Corps, part of the American Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott. By 8 January, the 86th Infantry had moved to Bagni di Lucca near in preparation for an offensive by the Fifth Army to capture the mountain along with surrounding high ground, which allowed the Axis to block advances to Po Valley. Starting 14 January, the division began moving to Pisa as part of the Fifth Army massing for this attack.

By 20 January, all three of the 10th&#x27;s regiments were on or near the front line between the Serchio Valley and Mt. Belvedere. Col. Raymond C. Barlow commanded the 85th Regiment, Col. Clarence M. Tomlinson the 86th, and Col. David M. Fowler the 87th.

Preliminary defensive actions in mid-February were followed by &quot;Operation Encore&quot;, a series of attacks in conjunction with troops of the 1st Brazilian Infantry Division, to dislodge the Germans from their artillery positions in the Northern Apennines on the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna regions, in order to make possible the Allied advance over the Po Valley. While the Brazilian division was in charge of taking Monte Castello and &quot;Castelnuovo&quot; di Vergato, the 10th Mountain Division was responsible for the Mount Belvedere area, climbing nearby Riva Ridge during the night of 18 February and attacking on 20 February. These peaks were cleared after four days of heavy fighting, as Axis troops launched several counterattacks in these positions.

In early March, the division fought its way north of Canolle and moved to within of Bologna. On 5 March, while Brazilian units captured Castelnuovo, the 85th and the 87th Infantry took respectively Mount Della Spe and Castel D&#x27;Aiano, cutting the Axis routes of resupply and communication into the Po Valley, setting the stage for the next Fifth Army offensive. The division maintained defensive positions in this area for three weeks, anticipating a counteroffensive by the German forces.

The division resumed its attack on 14 April, attacking Torre Iussi and Rocca Roffeno to the north of Mount Della Spe. On 17 April, it broke through the German defenses, which allowed it to advance into the Po Valley area. It captured Mongiorgio on 20 April and entered the valley, seizing the strategic points Pradalbino and Bomporto. The 10th crossed the Po River at San Benedetto Po on 23 April, reaching Verona 25 April, and ran into heavy opposition at Torbole and Nago. After an amphibious crossing of Lake Garda, it secured Gargnano and Porto di Tremosine, on 30 April, as German resistance in Italy ended. The awarding winning documentary 2023 The Lost Mountaineers and chronicles the last days of actions for the 10th Mountain Division and focuses on the death of 25 soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division who drowned at Lake Garda on the night of April, 30, 1945 when their amphibious craft (DUKW) sank. After the German surrender in Italy on 2 May 1945, the division went on security duty. On 5 May 1945 the division reached Nauders, Austria, just beyond the Reschen Pass, where it made contact with German forces being pushed south by the U.S. Seventh Army. A status quo was maintained until the enemy headquarters involved had completed their surrender to the Seventh. On the 6th, 10th Mountain Division troops met the 44th Infantry Division of the Seventh Army. Between the 2nd and Victory in Europe Day on 8 May the 10th Mountain Division received the surrender of various German units and screened areas of occupation near Trieste, Kobarid, Bovec and Log pod Mangartom, Slovenia. The division moved to Udine on 20 May and joined the British Eighth Army in preventing further westward movement of ground forces from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

==== Casualties ====
*Total battle casualties: 4,072
*Killed in action: 992
*Wounded in action: 3,134
*Missing in action: 38
*Prisoners of war: 28

==== Demobilization ====
In July, the Department of War assigned the 10th Mountain to the Pacific theater; after a month&#x27;s furlough the men would assemble at Camp Carson, where they would train for Operation Downfall, the invasion of mainland Japan. Between 26 July and 2 August the three regiments boarded ships for the return voyage to the United States; the day before the first of these regiments, the 86th Mountain Infantry, disembarked at Hampton Roads, Hiroshima was leveled by an atom bomb. Three days after the rest of the division landed stateside on 11 August, Japan officially surrendered. The division was demobilized and inactivated on 30 November 1945 at Camp Carson, Colorado. 

During World War II, the 10th Mountain Division suffered 992 killed in action and 4,154 wounded in action in 114 days of combat. Soldiers of the division were awarded one Medal of Honor (John D. Magrath), three Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, 449 Silver Star Medals, seven Legion of Merit Medals, 15 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, and 7,729 Bronze Star Medals. The division itself was awarded two campaign streamers.

=== Cold War ===
In June 1948, the division was rebuilt and activated at Fort Riley, Kansas to serve as a training division. Without its &quot;Mountain&quot; tab, the division served as the 10th Infantry Division for the next ten years. The unit was charged with processing and training replacements in large numbers. This mission was expanded with the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. By 1953, the division had trained 123,000 new Army recruits at Fort Riley.

In 1954, the division was converted to a combat division once again, though it did not regain its &quot;Mountain&quot; status. Using equipment from the deactivating 37th Infantry Division, the 10th Infantry Division was deployed to Germany, replacing the 1st Infantry Division at Würzburg, serving as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defensive force. The division served in Germany for four years, until it was rotated out and replaced by the 3rd Infantry Division. The division moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, and was inactivated on 14 June 1958.

==== Reactivation ====
On 13 February 1985, the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) was reactivated at Fort Drum, New York. In accordance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan, the division was no longer centered on regiments, instead two brigades were activated under the division. The 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division (commanded by then Colonel John M. Keane, later 4-Star General and Army Vice Chief of Staff) and Division Artillery were activated at Fort Drum, while the 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Benning, moving to Fort Drum in 1988. The division was also assigned a round-out brigade from the Army National Guard, the 27th Infantry Brigade. The division was specially designed as a light infantry division able to rapidly deploy. In this process, it lost its mountain warfare capability, but its light infantry organization still made it versatile for difficult terrain. Equipment design was oriented toward reduced size and weight for reasons of both strategic and tactical mobility. The division also received a distinctive unit insignia.

=== Contingencies ===

In 1990, the division sent 1,200 soldiers to support Operation Desert Storm. Two infantry platoons from the division were among those sent: 1st Platoon Bravo Company 1/22 and the 1/22 Scout Platoon. Once in Iraq, the scouts were sent home and First Platoon was left as a counterintelligence force. Performing three-man 24hr patrols through the remainder of their deployment, this platoon was widely regarded as the division&#x27;s best at that time. Following a cease-fire in March 1991, the support soldiers began redeploying to Fort Drum through June of that year.

Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida on 24 August 1992, killing 13 people, leaving another 250,000 homeless, and causing damages in excess of $20 billion. On 27 August 1992, the 10th Mountain Division assumed responsibility for Hurricane Andrew disaster relief as Task Force Mountain. Division soldiers set up relief camps, distributed food, clothing, medical necessities, and building supplies, as well as helping to rebuild homes and clear debris. The last of the 6,000 division soldiers deployed to Florida returned home in October 1992.

==== Operation Restore Hope ====

On 3 December 1992, the division headquarters was designated as the headquarters for all Army Forces (ARFOR) of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) for Operation Restore Hope. Major General Steven L. Arnold, the division Commander, was named Army Forces commander. The 10th Mountain Division&#x27;s mission was to secure major cities and roads to provide safe passage of relief supplies to the Somali population suffering from the effects of the Somali Civil War.

Due to 10th Mountain Division efforts, humanitarian agencies declared an end to the food emergency and factional fighting decreased. When Task Force Ranger and the SAR team were pinned down during a raid in what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu, the 10th Mountain Division provided infantry for the UN quick reaction force sent to rescue them. The 10th Mountain Division had two soldiers killed in the fighting, which was the longest sustained firefight by regular U.S. Army forces since the Vietnam War. The division began a gradual reduction of forces in Somalia in February 1994, until the last soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry returned to the United States in March 1994.

==== Operation Uphold Democracy ====

The division formed the nucleus of the Multinational Force Haiti (MNF Haiti) and Joint Task Force 190 (JTF 190) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. More than 8,600 of the division&#x27;s troops deployed during this operation. On 19 September 1994, the 1st Brigade conducted the Army&#x27;s first air assault from aircraft carrier USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport. This was the largest Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II.

The division&#x27;s mission was to create a secure and stable environment so the government of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide could be reestablished and democratic elections held. After this was accomplished, the 10th Mountain Division handed over control of the MNF-Haiti to the 25th Infantry Division on 15 January 1995. The division redeployed the last of its soldiers who served in Haiti by 31 January 1995.

==== Operation Joint Forge ====
In the fall of 1998, the division received notice that it would be serving as senior headquarters of Task Force Eagle, providing a peacekeeping force to support the ongoing operation within the Multi-National Division-North area of responsibility in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Selected division units began deploying in late summer, approximately 3,000 division soldiers deployed. After successfully performing their mission in Bosnia, the division units conducted a transfer of authority, relinquishing their assignments to soldiers of the 49th Armored Division, Texas National Guard. By early summer 2000, all 10th Mountain Division soldiers had returned safely to Fort Drum.

==== Operation Joint Guardian ====

==== Readiness controversy ====
During the 2000 presidential election, the readiness of the 10th Mountain Division became a political issue when George W. Bush asserted that the division was &quot;not ready for duty.&quot; He attributed the division&#x27;s low readiness to the frequent deployments throughout the 1990s without time in between for division elements to retrain and refit. A report from the U.S. General Accounting Office in July 2000 also noted that although the entire 10th Mountain Division was not deployed to the contingencies at once, &quot;deployment of key components—especially headquarters—makes these divisions unavailable for deployment elsewhere in case of a major war&quot;. Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation agreed with these sentiments, charging that the U.S. military overall was not prepared for war due to post-Cold War drawdowns of the U.S. Military. The Army responded that, though the 10th Mountain Division had been unprepared following its deployment as Task Force Eagle, that the unit was fully prepared for combat by late 2000 despite being undermanned. Still, the Army moved the 10th Mountain Division down on the deployment list, allowing it time to retrain and refit.

In 2002, columnist and highly decorated military veteran David Hackworth again criticized the 10th Mountain Division for being unprepared due to lack of training, low physical fitness, unprepared leadership, and low morale. He said the division was no longer capable of mountain warfare.

==== Initial deployments and 2004 reorganization ====

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, elements of the division, including its special troops battalion and 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment (1-87th) infantry deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. The division headquarters arrived at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base, under Major General Franklin L. Hagenbeck, on 12 December 2001 to function as the Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) (Forward). This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul T. Mikolashek, the Third U.S. Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) in the theater of operations. As such, Hagenbeck&#x27;s headquarters was responsible for commanding and controlling virtually all Coalition ground forces and ground force operations in the theater, including the security of Coalition airfields in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, as well as the logistics operations set up to support those forces. The division was also intended to defend Uzbekistan against attacks by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which was seeking to overthrow Islam Karimov&#x27;s secular government. 

On 13 February 2002, Mikolashek ordered Hagenbeck to move CFLCC (Forward) to Bagram airfield located at Bagram and 2 days later the headquarters was officially redesignated as Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Mountain. It assumed responsibility for the planning and execution of what had then become known as Operation Anaconda.

Elements of the division, primarily 1-87th Infantry, remained in the country until mid-2002, fighting to secure remote areas of the country and participating in prominent operations such as Operation Anaconda, the Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, and the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. These 1-87th Infantry soldiers became the first U.S. conventional forces to fight in Afghanistan. The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi Khot Valley in 2002. In June 2002, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived to relieve CJTF Mountain, and in September, Major General John R. Vines and his Combined Task Force 82 relieved CJTF Mountain as the major subordinate headquarters to Combined Joint Task Force 180. Upon the return of the battalions, they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush.

In 2003, the division&#x27;s headquarters, along with the 1st Brigade, returned to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier regions of the country such as Paktika Province, going to places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.

In 2003 and into 2004, the division&#x27;s aviation brigade deployed for the first time to Afghanistan. As the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade&#x27;s mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The 10th Mountain Division was the first unit to introduce contract working dogs into southern Afghanistan. In the spring of 2004, they had Patriot K-9 Services supply 20 dog teams based at KAF. The teams were trained to detect explosives and perform patrol duties throughout the region. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.

On the return of the division headquarters and 1st Brigade, the 10th Mountain Division began the process of transformation into a modular division. On 16 September 2004, the division headquarters finished its transformation, adding the 10th Mountain Division Special Troops Battalion. The 1st Brigade became the 1st Brigade Combat Team, while the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division was activated for the first time. In January 2005, the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Polk, Louisiana. 2nd Brigade Combat Team would not be transformed until September 2005, pending a deployment to Iraq.

==== Iraq deployments ====
In late 2004, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team was deployed to Iraq supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team undertook combat operations in western Baghdad, an area of responsibility that included Abu Ghraib, Mansour, and Route Irish. It returned to the US in late 2005. Around that time, the 1st Brigade Combat Team deployed back to Iraq, staying in the country until 2006.

The next time the 1st Brigade Combat Team was deployed was during the Surge for 15 months in Iraq. Northern Iraq was the theater of operations for 1 BCT from August 2007 until November 2008.

The 4th BCT operated in Northeast Baghdad under the 4th Infantry Division headquarters from November 2007 until January 2009. The 10th Mountain participated in larger-scale operations, such as Operation Phantom Phoenix.

After a one-year rest, the headquarters of the 10th Mountain Division was deployed to Iraq for the first time in April 2008. The division headquarters served as the command element for southern Baghdad until late March 2009, when it displaced to Basrah to replace departing British forces on 31 March 2009 to coordinate security for the Multinational Division-South area of responsibility, a consolidation of the previously Polish-led south-central and British-led southeast operational areas. The 10th Mountain Division headquarters transferred authority for MND-S to the 34th Infantry Division, Minnesota Army National Guard on 20 May 2009.

The 2nd Brigade Combat Team was scheduled to deploy to Iraq in the fall of 2009, as a part of the 2009–2010 rotation to Iraq.

==== Afghanistan deployments ====

The division headquarters, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, and two Battalion Task Forces from the 4th Brigade Combat Team deployed to Afghanistan in 2005, staying in the country until 2006. The division and brigade served in the eastern region of the country, along the border with Pakistan, fulfilling a similar role as it did during its previous deployment. During this time, the deployment of the brigade was extended along with that of the 4th Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division. It was eventually replaced by the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team which was rerouted from Iraq.

In the winter of 2006, the 10th Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, was deployed again to Afghanistan to support Operation Enduring Freedom as the only aviation brigade in the theater, stationed at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. Named &quot;Task Force Falcon,&quot; the brigade&#x27;s mission was to conduct aviation operations to destroy insurgents and anti-coalition militia in an effort to help build the Afghan National Security Force&#x27;s capability and allow the Afghan government to increase its capabilities. In addition, the Task Force provided logistical and combat support for International Security Assistance Force forces throughout the country.

The 3rd Brigade Combat Team was slated to deploy to Iraq in 2009, but that deployment was rerouted. In January 2009, the 3rd BCT instead deployed to Kunar, Logar and Wardak Provinces, eastern Afghanistan to relieve the 101st Airborne Division, as part of a new buildup of US forces in that country. The brigade was responsible for expanding forward operating bases and combat outposts (COPs) in the region, as well as strengthening US military presence in preparation for additional US forces to arrive.
The 1st Brigade Combat Team was scheduled to deploy to Iraq in late 2009 but deployed instead to Afghanistan in March 2010 for 13 months. 1-87th Infantry deployed to Kunduz and Baghlan Provinces, establishing remote combat outposts (COPs) against the Taliban after they had taken control of these provinces over the last several years. Notably, elements of the regiment were responsible for numerous large-scale engagements, including The Battle of Shahabuddin and securing a High-Value Target (HVT) after an air assault raid. Some elements of the Brigade deployed to Afghanistan in late January 2013 to Ghazni Provence for nine months.
The 3rd Brigade Combat Team deployed to Kandahar Province, southern Afghanistan in March 2011, again relieving the 101st Airborne Division. During this deployment, 3rd BCT mainly occupied forward operating bases (FOBs) and combat outposts (COPs) in the Maywand, Zhari, and Arghandab Districts of Kandahar Province. The brigade was redeployed to Fort Drum in March 2012 after a twelve-month deployment.

The 4th Brigade Combat Team deployed to Regional Command East, under the 101st Airborne Division from October 2010 until their redeployment in October 2011. The 4th BCT deployed to both Wardak and Logar provinces. During this deployment, they went to places such as Chakh Valley in Wardak Province and Charkh Valley in Logar Province in search of elements of the Haqqani Network. In May 2013, the brigade deployed again to Afghanistan returning home in February 2014.

In 2015, Diana M. Holland became the first woman to serve as a general officer at Fort Drum, and the first woman to serve as a deputy commanding general in one of the Army&#x27;s light infantry divisions (specifically, the 10th Mountain Division.)

In February 2015, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division were deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Resolute Support Mission in the Post ISAF phase of the War in Afghanistan between late summer and early fall 2015, 300 troops from 10th Mountain&#x27;s headquarters at deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel, along with about 1,000 troops from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.
In February 2016, the Taliban began a new assault on Sangin, Helmand Province, the US responded by deploying 500 to 800 troops from 2nd battalion 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division to Helmand Province in order to prop up Afghan army&#x27;s 215th Corps in the province, particularly around Sangin, joining US and British special operations forces already in the area.

On 5 December 2019, the Department of the Army announced that the 1st Brigade Combat Team would replace the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division as part of a unit rotation in support of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel. The brigade deployed to Afghanistan in February 2020.

=== Operation Atlantic Resolve ===
On 3 November 2016, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; reported that the 10th Combat Aviation Brigade would deploy 1,750 soldiers to Eastern Europe in March 2017, in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve – as part of NATO efforts to reassure Eastern Europe in response to Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014. The brigade arrived with approximately 60 aircraft, including CH-47 Chinooks, UH-60 Blackhawks, and medevac helicopters. The brigade was headquartered in Germany and the brigade&#x27;s units were forward-based at locations in Latvia, Romania, and Poland.

=== Operation Inherent Resolve ===
Between late summer and early fall 2015, as well as again in 2016, 1,250 soldiers from the 1st Brigade Combat Team were deployed to Iraq to support Operation Inherent Resolve. During the two deployments the brigade spent in Iraq, they fought to regain control of the cities of Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. In 2022 the unit would redeploy again, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

=== Controversial shoot house training viral video ===
A viral video showed soldiers in the division conducting live fire training in a shoot house. The soldiers violated numerous safety issues, including flagging and failure to follow norms of room clearing, such as failure to clear corners or follow points of domination, with observers giving no correction. Responding to the viral incident, Division CSM Mario O. Terenas addressed the incident on Twitter: &quot;it&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division. We ran it down to the ground and it is 10th Mountain Division. It is our folks, and it really, really hurts to say that...It is not the standard, it is not how we do business, and it is not acceptable. We&#x27;re running this thing down to the ground. We will investigate it, we will take action, and we will re-train. That is a guarantee.&quot;

== Honors ==

The 10th Mountain Division was awarded two campaign streamers in World War II, one campaign streamer for Somalia, and four campaign streamers in the War on Terrorism for a total of seven campaign streamers and three unit decorations in its operational history. Note that some of the division&#x27;s brigades received more or fewer decorations depending on their individual deployments.

== Legacy ==
Skiing associations subsequently contend that veterans of the 10th Mountain Division had a substantial effect on the post-World War II development of skiing as a vacation industry and major sport. Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out ski hills, designed ski lifts, became ski coaches, racers, instructors, patrollers, shop owners, and filmmakers. They wrote and published ski magazines, opened ski schools, improved ski equipment, and developed ski resorts. Up to 2,000 of the division&#x27;s troops were involved in skiing-related professions after the war, and at least 60 ski resorts were founded by men of the division. As Maurice Isserman notes in his book &quot;The Winter Army&quot;, &quot;The 10th Mountain Division was the only unit in the history of the US military to use wartime skills to promote a civilian pastime.&quot;

People associated with the 10th Mountain Division later went on to achieve notability in other fields. Among these are anthropologist Eric Wolf, mathematician Franz Alt, avalanche researcher and forecasting pioneer Montgomery Atwater, Congressman Les AuCoin, mountaineer and teacher who helped develop equipment for the 10th Mountain Robert Bates, noted mountaineer Fred Beckey, United States Ski Team member and Black Mountain of Maine resort co-founder Chummy Broomhall, former American track and field coach and co-founder of Nike, Inc. Bill Bowerman, former executive director and Sierra Club leader David R. Brower, former United States Ski Team member World War II civilian mountaineer trainer H. Adams Carter, former Senate Majority Leader and Presidential candidate Bob Dole, champion skier Dick Durrance, ski resort pioneer John Elvrum, Norwegian-American skier Sverre Engen, fashion illustrator Joe Eula, Olympic equestrian Earl Foster Thomson, civilian founder of the National Ski Patrol Charles Minot Dole, painter Gino Hollander, Paleoclimatologist John Imbrie, theoretical physicist Francis E. Low, US downhill ski champion Toni Matt, falconer and educator Morley Nelson, comic book artist Earl Norem, founder of National Outdoor Leadership School and The Wilderness Education Association Paul Petzoldt, world downhill ski champion Walter Prager, demolition derby driver Joshua Tagliaboschi, retired broadcasting executive William Lowell Putnam III, Massachusetts Governor Francis W. Sargent, World War II civilian ski instructor and division trainer Hannes Schneider, founder of Vail Ski Resort Pete Seibert, actor and Olympic medalist Floyd Simmons, historian and author Page Smith, members of the famous von Trapp family singers Werner von Trapp and Rupert von Trapp, Rawleigh Warner, Jr., chairman and CEO of Mobil, civilian technical adviser Fritz Wiessner, William John Wolfgram, Olympic Ski jumper Gordon Wren, Massachusetts Congressional candidate Nathan Bech, leader of Chalk 4 during the Battle of Mogadishu Matt Eversmann, Middle East analyst, blogger, and author Andrew Exum, and author Craig Mullaney.

Additionally, four members of the division have been awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1945 John D. Magrath became the first member of the division to receive this award (posthumously) during World War II. The second, Jared C. Monti, received it posthumously in 2009, for actions during a combat operation on 21 June 2006 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The third, William D. Swenson, received it in 2013, for actions on 8 September 2009, during the Battle of Ganjgal in Afghanistan. The fourth, Travis W. Atkins, received it posthumously on 27 March 2019, for actions on 1 June 2007 during a patrol in Iraq.

The division&#x27;s efforts in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom and beyond led to the division being referred to as the &quot;Tribe of Crossed Swords&quot; by some Afghans.

==In popular culture==
The 10th Mountain Division was the subject of the 1996 film &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;, which documented its exploits during World War II. The 10th Mountain Division is also a prominent element of the book &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and film &quot;by the same name&quot;, which portrays the Battle of Mogadishu and the division&#x27;s participation in that conflict. Among the division&#x27;s other appearances are the Tom Clancy novel &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, the 2004, War Of The Worlds remake, the 2005 SCI FI film &quot;Manticore&quot;, 2010 remake starring Keanu Reeves, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Sean Parnell&#x27;s 2012 war memoir, &quot;Outlaw Platoon&quot;, about his platoon&#x27;s experiences in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, the 2019 action adventure video game &quot;Days Gone&quot;, with the game&#x27;s main protagonist, Deacon St. John, referencing his time spent with the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan.

== Organization ==
This division consists of a division headquarters and headquarters battalion, three infantry brigade combat teams, a division artillery, a combat aviation brigade, and a division sustainment brigade. The division artillery has training and readiness oversight over the division&#x27;s field artillery battalions, which remain organic to their brigade combat teams.

<text>&quot;Jug wine&quot; is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine typically bottled in a glass bottle or jug. 

Historically, jug wines were labeled semi-generically, often sold to third parties to be relabeled, or sold directly from the winery&#x27;s tasting room to customers who would often bring their own bottles. For a period following Prohibition, jug wines were the only domestic wine available for most Americans. Beginning in the 1960s, when Americans began to consume more premium wine, jug wine took on a reputation for being &quot;extreme value&quot; (bargain-priced premium wine). Beginning in the late 1980s jug wines have increasingly been labeled varietally to meet consumer demand.

==Common brands==
Common brands include Gallo, Carlo Rossi, Almaden Vineyards, and Inglenook Winery. Typical formats include 750 ml and one liter glass bottles, as well as three and five-liter jugs. More recent packaging methods include lined boxes, and plastic bags inside corrugated fiberboard boxes (&quot;bag in a box&quot;).

<text>Boxed wine (cask wine) is a wine sold in &quot;bag-in-box&quot; packaging. Traditionally, this consists of a cardboard box containing a wine filled plastic reservoir. The flow of the wine from the box is controlled by a valve.

==History==
The process for packaging &quot;cask wine&quot; (boxed wine) was invented by Thomas Angove, a winemaker from Renmark, South Australia, and patented by his company on April 20, 1964. Polyethylene bladders of one gallon (4.5 litres) were placed in corrugated boxes for retail sale. The original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder, pour out the serving of wine, and then reseal it with a special peg. This design was based on a product already on the market, a bag in a box used by mechanics to hold and transport battery acid.

In 1967, Australian inventor Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic, air-tight tap welded to a metallised bladder, making storage more convenient. Modern wine casks use plastic taps which can be exposed by tearing away a perforated panel on the box. For the following decades, &#x27;bag in a box&#x27; packaging was primarily preferred by producers of less expensive wines, as they were cheaper to produce and distribute than glass flagons, which served a similar market.

In Australia, due to the difference in how wine is taxed compared to other alcoholic beverages, boxed wine is often the least expensive form of drinkable alcohol. A 4-litre cask of at least 9.5% alcohol can often be found for around . These attributes have led to boxed wine being widely available throughout Australia and holding a prominent place in Australian pop culture.

During the mid-1970s, the bag-in-box packaging concept expanded to other beverages, including spring waters, orange juices, and wine coolers.

In 2003, California Central Coast AVA based Black Box Wines introduced mass premium wines in a box. Within the decade, premium wineries and bottlers began packaging their own high-quality boxed wine. This, coupled with an increased cultural interest in environmentally sustainable packaging, has cultivated growing popularity with affluent wine consumers.

== Attributes ==
Box wines utilize plastic bags instead of traditional glass bottles, significantly reducing production and shipping costs, which makes them a more affordable option for consumers.

Typical bag-in-box containers hold one and a half to four 750 ml bottles of wine per box, though they come in a wide variety of volumes. Bag-in-box packaging is cheaper and lighter than glass-bottled wine.

The removal of wine from the flexible bag without adding air to fill the vacated space greatly reduces the oxidation of the wine during dispensing. Compared to bottled wine, which should be consumed within hours or days of opening, bag-in-box wine will not spoil for approximately 3–4 weeks after breaking the seal, or even longer if the wine is kept refrigerated after opening. In addition, it is not subject to cork taint. Wine contained in plastic bladders is not intended for cellaring and should be consumed within the manufacturer&#x27;s printed shelf life. Deterioration may be noticeable 12 months after filling.

===Environmental friendly===
The Scandinavian state institutions Systembolaget and Vinmonopolet analyzed the environmental impact of various wine packaging in 2010. Bag-in-Box packaging was found to leave only 12% to 29% of the carbon footprint of bottled wine and was found to be superior by every other ecological criterion.

Tyler Colman from &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that bag-in-box is more environmentally friendly than bottled wine as well as easier to transport and store.

===Health concerns===
The introduction of cask wine in the late 1960s has had significant negative consequences. The Australian wine industry has benefited from favorable tax policies, which have led to a substantial increase in both domestic consumption and international exports. However, these developments have not been without drawbacks, particularly in terms of public health and social issues related to increased alcohol accessibility and consumption.

== Colloquialisms ==
In Australia, boxed wine is known colloquially as &quot;goon&quot;. The cardboard box is referred to as a &quot;goon box&quot; and the bag within is referred to as a &quot;goon bag&quot;. A common Australian drinking game is Goon of Fortune, in which a goon bag is suspended from a Hills Hoist and spun, and whoever it stops on must drink a selected amount of the goon.

The word goon is derived from the word flagon, which is a traditional container for retailing inexpensive wine or vinegar. An occasional Australian pronunciation of the word flagon, perhaps with humorous intent, placed emphasis on the second syllable such that flagon came to be pronounced as &quot;fla-goon&quot;, which was then shortened to simply &quot;goon&quot;.

Additionally, in Australia the term &quot;silverpillow&quot; is used to refer to the habit of inflating the empty bag and using it as a headrest.

In New Zealand, the term &quot;Château Cardboard&quot;, originally a joking reference to the wine&#x27;s container, has entered the vernacular to refer to box wine.

In Finland, the terms are &quot;käsilaukku&quot; (&quot;handbag&quot;), &quot;humppakuutio&quot; (&quot;Humppa Cube&quot;) and &quot;noppa&quot; (dice).

<text>Julius Hatry (30 December 1906 – 7 November 2000) was a German aircraft designer and builder. He is remembered for his contributions to sailplane development in the early twentieth century and for building the world&#x27;s first purpose-built rocket plane, the Opel RAK.1.

Hatry was born in Mannheim as son of Katharina and Julius Hatry senior, a successful Mannheim real estate entrepreneur. Julius Hatry junior developed an early interest in aviation, joining the Mannheim flying club in 1922. With the club, he became a frequent visitor to the annual gliding competitions held at the Wasserkuppe during the 1920s. Between 1927 and 1928, he assisted in the construction of the &quot;Kakadu&quot; (then the largest sailplane ever built) with the Munich Akaflieg (student flying) group. References from Alexander Lippisch and Oskar Ursinus helped him gain his first design contract, for a motor glider which never actually flew due to problems with its powerplant. His association with Lippisch also allowed him to participate in the 1928 rocketry experiments carried out for Fritz von Opel within Opel RAK, the world&#x27;s first rocket program. This led to von Opel commissioning him to build him a rocket plane for a public demonstration the following year.

== Hatry and the world&#x27;s first rocket program Opel RAK ==

As early as 1922, Julius Hatry, nicknamed &quot;Uss&quot;, became a member of the Mannheim Aviation Club and through this came into contact with the first Rhön competitions. In 1927 he did the Abitur and passed the glider pilot C exam. His certificate with the number 409 was the first in the German state of Baden. He began studying engineering at the Technical University of Munich and worked as a flight instructor in Rossitten (East Prussia), where he also designed large aircraft models for the first time. In 1927/28, under August Kupper, Hatry was significantly involved in the construction of the Mü 3 &quot;Kakadu&quot;, the largest glider at the time. In 1928 Hatry himself took part in a Rhön competition for the first time with the two-seater &quot;Mannheim&quot;. He had met Alexander Lippisch and Oskar Ursinus in the aviation scene and was therefore commissioned to design a cell for a motor glider. However, the engine did not pass the type approval test. Then he developed the &quot;Water Rat&quot;, a water glider with a boat-like fuselage and raised tail unit, with which he was awarded 1200 Reichsmark in the technical competition in the “Preisfliegen Rossitten 1928/1929”. In the meantime, Lippisch had carried out the first rocket model tests in 1928 on befalf of Fritz von Opel&#x27;s Opel RAK program, using Friedrich Sander&#x27;s rockets. Hatry evaluated the flight curves mathematically for months and was able to prove physical relationships between the thrust axis, center of gravity and the flight curves: The unsatisfactory results of the early experiments prompted Hatry to first analyze the problem theoretically and examine the flight behavior of a rocket plane more closely. While the space flight pioneers like Oberth and Goddard created their basic calculations for missile flights outside the earth&#x27;s gravitational field, Hatry set up the basic equations of aircraft with rocket propulsion within the gravity range for the first time. This was Hatry&#x27;s pioneering achievement in aeronautical science. His flight-mechanical calculations provided the requirements for the documents for the rocket aircraft model he built. Experiments with this model confirmed Hatry&#x27;s calculations. This refuted Lippisch&#x27;s wrong deduction about the causes of the unstable flight in his early Opel RAK experiments with Stamer as test pilot of the &quot;Lippisch Ente&quot;. Lippisch found this so uncomfortable that he asked Hatry not to publish his calculations. Out of respect, Hatry followed Lippisch&#x27;s request that this fundamental theoretical work would not be published in a specialist journal. As a scientific publication, it remained known only to a narrow circle of specialists and it was not until 1983 that Hatry published his equations, when they were already the subject of historical research.

After this preliminary work, Lippisch suggested the construction of new dedicated manned rocket aircraft. Hatry began construction in June 1929. Although initially working on his own, he later also entered the Opel RAK team, the industrialist Fritz von Opel provided the financial means for the construction of the RAK.1 within the OPEL RAK program framework.

Hatry was thrilled about the prospects of rocket flight. Immediately, in April 1929, he rented a workshop in Gersfeld (Rhön) and began to design and build his machine himself. He worked obsessively, faced with competition from the entire aviation industry. It was not a converted glider (as the &quot;Lippisch Ente&quot;), but a special design and construction according to the building regulations of the time for powered airplanes, which were much stricter than for gliders. The aircraft was intended exclusively for propulsion using solid-fuel rockets and for launch using a solid-rocket catapult, making it the first rocket aircraft in the world. It was at this time that Fritz von Opel found out about Hatry&#x27;s work. Fritz von Opel, son of Wilhelm von Opel, was a co-owner of the car company and headed the advanced engineering and vehicle testing department and was also responsible for the Public Relations of the Opel company. Von Opel was already well-known as highly successful in any type of motors sports. Within Opel RAK, he and Max Valier, based on their successful rocket-powered land vehicles, wanted to build a rocket plane - leading to the Opel RAK experiments by Stamer and Lippisch at Wasserkuppe. Von Opel piloted himself the spectacular speed record drive of the RAK2 at the AVUS racetrack in Berlin, before a huge crowd and world media in 1928. The RAK2 car, as its predecessor the RAK1 rocket car, was built in Rüsselsheim on the company premises, equipped with rockets by Friedrich Sander (1885-1938).

Through the mediation of Sander and Lippisch, Opel was able to achieve a cooperation contract with Hatry: In the contract was stated that Hatry would do a test flight, and von Opel the first public flight. At the time of signing, the aircraft was still under construction, the hand-over was anticipated for end of July 1929. It was planned that after Opel&#x27;s first public flight with the plane, Hatry would carry out rocket plane flights as a pilot at 42 places with which he had already concluded corresponding contracts. For this Hatry should receive at least 1000 Reichsmark per month and an additional 500 Reichsmark for each flight.

In accordance with the contract, the finished aircraft was delivered to Frankfurt at the beginning of September. In order to maintain secrecy, the tests were started with the aircraft, which was equipped with Sander&#x27;s rockets, in a meadow near the “Mönchbruch” hunting estate near Frankfurt.

After a first successful test flight by von Opel in early September at &quot;Jagdgut Mönchbruch&quot; using a winch-launch procedure, on September 17, 1929, the prototype and the final launch catapult was ready and Hatry was able to travel about 500 meters at a height of 20 meters at a speed of 100 km / h, propelled by three solid fuel rockets that had 350 kilopond thrust and four seconds of burn time. Von Opel then invited the press to a public presentation in Frankfurt-Rebstock on September 30, during which he flew the RAK.1 himself. Von Opel was able to cover around three kilometers in 80 seconds on this flight. Even after that, Hatry continued to work on the construction of new types but was eventually sidelined by the Nazi government and military.

The RAK.2 did not get beyond a draft, however.

The Opel RAK program was discontinued due to the Great Depression. Von Opel left Germany before 1930 to the US, after the war to France and Switzerland. Fritz&#x27; sister Elinor von Opel had to flee Germany in a dramatic manner, hunted by SS troops, together with her two sons, the younger one was Gunter Sachs von Opel, to Switzerland in 1935, due to a bitter divorce battle and a public aversion to the Nazi leadership friends of her ex-husband. Max Valier, a member of the Opel RAK leadership, had after the Opel RAK breakup a fatal accident while testing liquid-fuel rocket motors in 1930. Friedrich Sander was engaged in German military projects under General Walter Dornberger but was imprisoned for treason by the Nazis and forced to sell his business. Sander died in custody 1938.

The collaboration between von Opel and Hatry was an alliance of convenience from the start and certainly not a &quot;love marriage&quot;. A bitter rivalry erupted between them on who had the greater share in the plane construction: the technology designer or the financier and program head. Since the damage of RAK.1 while landing and due to the Great Depression also the 42 demonstration flights piloted by Hatry were canceled. The dispute could only be settled in 1934 and 1935 by an Opel payment of 10,000 Reichsmark in two tranches. Nevertheless, Hatry suffered lifelong trauma due to injustice, unfulfilled hopes and a very long concealment of his actual achievements.

Hatry returned devoting himself to studying the various problems of aerodynamics, gas dynamics, thermodynamics, ballistics and others that arise when designing rocket-powered aircraft. From April 1930 to spring 1933, Hatry earned his living as a construction examiner, 2nd class of the German Aviation Association: He carried out the construction test of gliders in the area responsible for him in North Baden / Palatinate.

== Third Reich period ==

With the &quot;Machtübernahme&quot; or &quot;takeover of power&quot; by the Nazi Party in 1933, Hatry had increasing difficulties because he had a Jewish grandfather: Hatry had to leave his job as a construction inspector. He was, in his words, &quot;kicked out of the Badisch-Palatinate Aviation Association in Mannheim by the then SS-Fliegersturmführer ...&quot;. So Hatry went back to Berlin, where he hoped for the support of Ernst Udet, now in the Aviation Ministry. He still believed that he could be useful as a rocket aircraft engineer. This area was not under Udet, but under Walter Dornberger (1895–1980) in the Heereswaffenamt. Dornberger showed a lot of interest and ordered a comprehensive elaboration from Hatry on all conceivable possible uses of missiles, including as a weapon. A year of intensive research followed, including, among other things, the processing of experiments by the &quot;AG for Industrial Gas Utilization Heylandt&quot; with liquid-fuel rockets, that were accessible to him thanks to the help of Professor Wilhelm Hoff (1883–1945), head of the Aviation Research Institute. This is how Hatry wrote his report, which &quot;assumed the scope and content of a doctoral thesis&quot;. When he handed over his work to Dornberger, he was asked for his personal papers. &quot;I never heard from the Army Office again!&quot;. Hatry later suspected that this work was used in Peenemünde. With it, his engineering activity came to an abrupt end, and Hatry was excluded from the great opportunities for further development in his field. Hatry himself wrote later at great age, not without bitterness: &quot;In this way, on the one hand, I was spared the typical research fate that a purposeless search for expansion of human knowledge and possibilities is steered through time events in a direction that was never inherent in the original intentions. On the other hand, however, a job that had begun promisingly at a very young age certainly could not find its crowning glory.&quot;

== Life after end of rocket plane design career ==

In 1935, Hatry married the actress, Annemarie Schradiek. In the same year, he had to stop his research at the instigation of the National Socialists because he had a Jewish grandfather. So, he now turned completely to film. Arnold Fanck had already hired him in 1925. First as an actor because he was a very good skier, then as a cameraman. Hatry made films with Hannes Schneider, Luis Trenker, Leni Riefenstahl and Ernst Udet in the 20s. Udet also stood up for him during the Nazi era. As a screenwriter and assistant director, he made entertainment films for the Tobis company in Berlin, in which Theo Lingen, Leni Marenbach and Rudolf Prack contributed, among others. From 1943 to 45, he was production manager and director for the Mars film company and made educational films for the Air Force. Also, during his second career in the movie business, Hatry faced many setbacks and discriminations due to his Jewish origins, especially after Udet&#x27;s death who had tried to protect and shield Hatry. &quot;Highly satisfying job and widely recognized. But: after Udets death, termination without notice on December 31, 1941&quot;, Hatry noted. Nevertheless, he could sign a temporary contract with &quot;Tobis Filmkunst GmbH&quot;: he was assistant director for the films &quot;Die große Nummer&quot; and &quot;Die Wirtin zum Weißen Rössl&quot;, and co-director of the film &quot;Die tolle Nacht&quot;.

In February 1945, Hatry experienced the infamous air raids on the city in Dresden, which he later described in detail. Despite all the horror of the events he portrayed, Hatry closed his description denouncing Hitler and Nazi Germany as root cause of the disaster. After the end of the war, Hatry was able to return to his family in Hamburg.

Even after the World War, Julius Hatry remained versatile. He made documentaries. Commissioned by Alfred Döblin, he dramatized &quot;Der Oberst und der Dichter&quot; and acted as director at the Baden-Baden Theater. He translated the writers Anouilh, Bridie and Vercors. He dubbed French films and even represented Germany with his own movie &quot;Reitanleitung für eine Geliebte&quot; at the 1950 Venice Biennale.

After the father&#x27;s death in 1950 and the bankruptcy of his movie business in 1953, Hatry&#x27;s mother had finally persuaded him to take over the father&#x27;s real-estate business. In 1952, Hatry and his family left Hamburg for good to continue running and expanding the &quot;Julius Hatry&quot; company in Mannheim. Here too, Hatry worked with full devotion. He was particularly active in the reconstruction of Mannheim&#x27;s most important shopping street (Planken) and its passages. He not only worked as an entrepreneur, but also as an architect. With his conceptions, he contributed to several house blocks in squares O7 and P7, especially house P7, 1 for his own company, as well as to Viktoriahaus, OVA- and Kurpfalzpassage. Hatry also worked as an interior designer, especially for offices and facilities for medical doctors.

Nationwide, Hatry procured suitable retail locations for large chain stores such as &quot;Quelle&quot;, &quot;Tengelmann&quot;, and others all over Germany. Hatry became a member of the &quot;Ring Deutscher Makler&quot; association and enjoyed high reputation among experts. He ran his company until 1991.

In 1982, Hatry returned to aviation when he joined the German Aerospace Society (DGLR) despite being aged around 75 years. In 1985, he took over the position of coordinator for the short biographies of the Pioneers series and a year later he was involved in the re-establishment of the district group North Baden-Palatinate, which he headed until his death. Hatry died of heart failure in a Mannheim hospital.

== Awards ==

The DGLR awarded Hatry the status of a &quot;Corresponding Member&quot; (Honorary Fellow) at the German Aerospace Congress 1992 &quot;in recognition of his pioneering designs and experiments for rocket propulsion for aircraft&quot;.

Hatry was awarded the Ziolkowsky Medal of Honor in Kaluga, Russia. The city of Mannheim named a street in the Glückstein Quarter after him and on November 22, 2016, decided on the honorary status for his grave in the main cemetery. A replica of the RAK.1 can be viewed in the Technoseum in Mannheim, the construction of which Hatry himself supervised.

<text>The Evangelical Mennonite Conference is a conference of Canadian evangelical Mennonite Christians headquartered in Steinbach, Manitoba, with 62 churches from British Columbia to southern Ontario. It includes people with a wide range of cultural and denominational backgrounds.

==Overview==
The churches of the &quot;Evangelical Mennonite Conference&quot; are located in five west-central Canadian provinces from British Columbia to Ontario. In 2012 there were over 7,200 members in 62 churches, with roughly 150 ministers serving the churches. The congregations are organized into nine regions. Mission work is established in 25 countries, often working in formal mission partnerships with evangelical interdenominational or Anabaptist organizations.

The EMC has five national boards with wide ranging responsibilities. It, however, is ultimately governed by its churches together, whose delegates are to attend conference council meetings twice a year and whose ministerial members are to meet nationally twice a year (including on retreat).

The EMC archives, offices, and its Steinbach Christian High School and Steinbach Bible College are located in Steinbach, Manitoba, Canada. The EMC is linked to the graduate-level School of Ministry and Theology connected with Canadian Mennonite University in Winnipeg.

&quot;The Messenger&quot;, an official publication of the conference, is printed 12 times per year and available on-line. &quot;Theodidaktos, Journal for EMC theology and education&quot; is published once or twice a year and available on-line. The conference also occasionally publishes a &quot;Christian Education Update&quot;. In 2006 it published &quot;Follow Me&quot;, a Sunday School resource on biblical social justice. The conference has also published preaching helps and produced CDs booklets on Peace Sermons (2011, 2008, 2007).

In the 1940s an evangelical revival in the EMC was led by Rev. Ben D. Reimer and others. The defining mark of the EMC in recent years has been its missions emphasis. Currently, more than half of the Conference&#x27;s national budget goes to missions. Church planting within Canada is a concern that is reflected within the national budget.

There is a growing emphasis on holistic ministry, not simply on multiplying churches, but on churches reflecting more of Jesus&#x27; calling Christians to &quot;obey everything that I have commanded you&quot; (Matthew 28:20). This is seen as, in part, a return to the holistic emphasis of Menno Simons, the early Dutch leader, that &quot;true evangelical faith...cannot lie dormant, but manifests itself in all righteousness and works of love&quot; (&quot;The Complete Writings of Menno Simons&quot;, 307).

The &quot;Evangelical Mennonite Conference&quot; is a member of the &quot;Evangelical Fellowship of Canada,&quot; Mennonite Central Committee, the Mennonite World Conference, and other organizations.

== History ==

=== Klaas Reimer ===

The Evangelical Mennonite Conference traces its roots back to 1812, when the Kleine Gemeinde was founded in the Molotschna settlement of southern Russia (now Ukraine) by a group of Plautdietsch-speaking &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites of Dutch-Prussian cultural background. Kleine Gemeinde means &quot;Small&quot; or &quot;Little Church&quot; in High German, while the Plautdietsch version of the name is &quot;Kleen Gemeente&quot;.

Klaas Reimer (1770–1837), a Mennonite minister from Danzig, settled in Molotschna, a Mennonite settlement in southern Russia in 1805. Reimer felt Mennonites of the area were too lax in doctrine and piety, and began to hold meetings in homes in 1812. He was joined by another minister, Cornelius Janzen, and eighteen members, who together recognized themselves as a separate church body in 1814.

As for reasons for the 1812 separation, an 1838 pamphlet addresses five disputes with the main Mennonite body. The primary complaint was that Mennonite leaders were straying from their traditional nonresistant stance when they turned lawbreakers over to the government for punishment while at the same time church leaders became more lax in enforcing spiritual discipline. An increased use of alcohol and other vices were cited as evidence.

The second problem was inconsistent application of discipline for minor offenses; while the breakaway group was banned, other types of offenses were ignored. Third, to a disloyalty charge, they reaffirmed their submission to the government while maintaining a stance against any involvement with detaining or punishing offenders. Fourth, they did not approve of attending weddings, which had become worldly in their view. Its final criticism was aimed at sermons and eulogies at funerals, practices that had recently been adopted from Catholics and Lutherans.

=== Migration to North America ===

In 1870 the Russian government issued a proclamation stating the intention to end all special privileges granted to Mennonite colonists by 1880. Alarmed at the possibility of losing control of their schools and military exemption, a delegation of Mennonite and Hutterite leaders, including Cornelius Toews and David Claassen of the Kleine Gemeinde, visited North America in 1873 to investigate resettlement possibilities. In 1874–75, the main group proceeded to migrate to North America, the more conservative part settling in Manitoba, Canada, and the more liberal to Jefferson County, near the town of Jansen, Nebraska, US. All together some 200 Kleine Gemeide families emigrated to North America as part of a larger Mennonite migration. About eighty homesteaded in southern Manitoba, especially in the East Reserve, while a smaller group settled in Nebraska.

In 1860 a portion of this group migrated to Crimea under the leadership of Jakob Wiebe. This group adopted baptism by immersion. After migrating in 1874 to Kansas, they became known as the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren. The Jansen group moved to Kansas and eventually seceded from the Kleine Gemeinde. Later, a number of the Kleine Gemeinde went into the movement of Elder John Holdeman (Church of God in Christ, Mennonite).

=== Migration to Mexico ===

In 1948 conservative families of the Kleine Gemeinde, all together some 800 people, migrated from Canada to Los Jagueyes Colony (Quellenkolonie) some 100 km north of Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua in Mexico. Resisting the radical changes of Kleine Gemeinde in Canada, the Mexican branch kept its name, tradition and identity and expanded to Belize in 1958 and later to Bolivia. In 2015 the Kleine Gemeinde had some 4,500 members - all of Russian Mennonite ethnic origin - in Latin America, where it is still expanding.

=== Radical change in North America ===
In the mid-20th century, the denomination in Canada radically transformed in three major ways, by adopting evangelical theology, by gradually eliminating traditional Mennonite practices (such as plain dress) and by becoming a multi-lingual and multi-ethnic denomination. The first EMC missionary was Susanne Plett, who left as a missionary to Bolivia in 1945, though without official support. Others followed her example. In 1952 the Kleine Gemeinde in North America, which consisted of just 5 congregation at the time, changed its name to the &quot;Evangelical Mennonite Church&quot;, and then (because of a U.S. group of prior, same name) to the &quot;Evangelical Mennonite Conference&quot; in 1959. The much more conservative Kleine Gemeinde in Mexico kept the traditional name and most of the traditions of the Kleine Gemeinde.
From 1946 to 1961 the EMC was influenced by the Western Gospel Mission, an evangelism/church planting initiative in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and NW Ontario, by supportive members and churches of the EMC.

Edwin Wright, born in Wales, was the first non-Russian Mennonite pastor to serve in the EMC; he served churches at Endeavour, Sask., and Riverton, Man., in the 1960s Now many churches have leaders who are not of Russian Mennonite background. A worship service language shift from German to English among older congregations was largely completed in the 1960s; among younger churches, English was often the original language used.

Education became increasingly valued. The EMC became an official partner in Steinbach Bible College, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2012. Today many EMC members have college, university, or seminary degrees.

In recent decades, some Mennonites of more conservative backgrounds have moved back to Canada from Mexico and Paraguay and joined congregations (sometimes with the High German language being used in services). Latin Americans have also joined other congregations or started new churches (with Spanish and sometimes English being used).

=== Present ===
The EMC&#x27;s members, adherents, and leaders are diverse in their church and cultural backgrounds. Since the 1940s the EMC has moved consciously beyond its historic Dutch-Prussian cultural roots and has expanded into other cultural groups. Recently it has developed Hispanic congregations. In Canada, worship services are conducted in three languages, with English being most commonly used.

The denomination celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2012. It stressed the spiritual history of the denomination. The denomination is engaged in a strategic planning process. In December 2012 its conference council delegates approved a grass-roots process to look at its Statement of Faith.

==Doctrine==
Beliefs and practices of the &quot;Evangelical Mennonite Conference&quot; are presented in its &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; and &quot;Church Practices,&quot; most recently revised in 1994. They reveal evangelical Christian teachings such as the Trinity, humanity&#x27;s need, salvation through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ, and the expected return of Christ. Underlying these beliefs are the final authority and infallibility of Scripture. The EMC is Arminian in theology: holding to total depravity, conditional election, unlimited atonement, resistible grace, and conditional security. Some members differ individually, more on the final point.

Anabaptist distinctives such as baptism upon confession of faith, non-conformity, mutual accountability, church discipline, congregational governance, non-swearing of oaths, and non-resistance are maintained.

Belief in Jesus and discipleship in lifestyle are not to be separated. Individual discipleship is to be shown through togetherness with other believers and service to wider society.

&quot;The Life of Peace&quot; (Statement of Faith, Article 9) includes, &quot;Instead of taking up arms, we should do whatever we can to lessen human distress and suffering, even at the risk of our own lives.&quot; In &quot;The State&quot; (Church Practices, Article 9) it says, &quot;Christians should respect civil authorities and pray for them; pay taxes; assume social responsibility; oppose corruption, discrimination, and injustice; and obey all their requirements that do not conflict with the Scriptures.&quot;

The EMC officially takes a complementarian stance and does not ordain women into the ministry. Some women, however, do serve in associate or senior pastoral roles. Women can serve on national boards and committees and as church delegates. Many women are active in missionary work. Discussions continue, unofficially, on the matter of women and church leadership.

Three ordinances are held — believers&#x27; baptism, the Lord&#x27;s supper, and foot washing, though the last is not widely practiced. Baptism is by pouring or immersion.

Discussions on various theological and social issues are on-going. The EMC reflects a &quot;community hermeneutic,&quot; the conviction and practice that the Scriptures are best interpreted by a gathered community, not simply as individuals nor as a clergy class handing down its decisions to so-called lay members.

== Members and congregations ==

As of 1998 the Evangelical Mennonite Conference had some 6,508 members in 53 congregations in Canada. In 2011, it had 62 churches and approximately 7,200 member of different ethnic backgrounds, including larger numbers of Hispanics and Africans.

<text>A changelog (also spelled change log) is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc. Some open-source projects include a changelog as one of the top-level files in their distribution.

A changelog has historically included all changes made to a project. An alternative approach has been suggested that the log should instead contain &quot;a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project&quot; and should not be a &quot;dump&quot; of a git log &quot;because this helps nobody&quot;.

Although the GNU (Automake) canonical naming convention for the file is &quot;ChangeLog&quot;, it is sometimes alternatively named as &quot;CHANGES&quot; or &quot;HISTORY&quot; (&quot;NEWS&quot; is usually a different file reflecting changes between releases, not between the commits). Another convention is to call it a &quot;CHANGELOG&quot;. Some project maintainers will append a &quot;.txt&quot; suffix to the file name if the changelog is plain text, a &quot;.md&quot; suffix if it is in Markdown, or a &quot;.rst&quot; suffix if it is in reStructuredText.

Some revision control systems are able to generate the relevant information for a changelog, if the goal is to include all changes.

==Format==
Changelog files are organized by paragraphs, which define a unique change within a function or file.
The GNU Coding standards recommend the following format:
Between the date and the name, and again between the name and the email address, there are two spaces each. It is common to enclose the email address in &lt; and &gt;. The Emacs editor creates such entries when creating additional changelog entries.

==Changelogs in wikis==
Most wiki software includes &quot;changelogs&quot; as a fundamental feature (often called &quot;history&quot; in this context). For example, the &quot;View history&quot; link at the top of a Wikipedia entry links to that page&#x27;s changelog. This feature is vital for complying with the attribution requirements of some copyright licenses.

==Product changelogs==

A product changelog can keep customers in the loop about what&#x27;s new. It helps to announce new features, latest releases, and relevant news directly in-app.

<doc id="418018" wikidata="Q903796" url="?curid=418018" title="Soyuz 24">
<text>Soyuz 24 (, &quot;Union 24&quot;) was a February, 1977, Soviet mission to the Salyut 5 space station, the third and final mission to the station, the last purely military crew for the Soviets and the final mission to a military Salyut. The cosmonauts Viktor Gorbatko and Yuri Glazkov re-activated the station after toxic fumes had apparently terminated the mission of Soyuz 21, the previous crew.

They performed biological and materials experiments while on board. Other presumed activities included photographic reconnaissance, and finishing tasks the previous crew was forced to abandon when their mission abruptly ended. The Soyuz 24 crew landed after spending 18 days in space, and the Salyut station was de-orbited six months later.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Reserve crew ===
== Mission highlights ==
The cosmonauts Gorbatko and Glazkov were the back-up crew for Soyuz 23, which failed to dock with Salyut 5 several months earlier. Soyuz 24 was launched 7 February 1977, and successfully docked with the orbiting space station the next day. However, the crew did not immediately enter the station, atypically having a sleep period first and delaying their entry by some 11 hours. Observers speculate that problems with fumes which may have caused the Soyuz 21 crew to leave were resolved or dealt with by the new crew. They entered the station wearing breathing apparatus and made numerous tests of the atmosphere before apparently concluding conditions were safe and removing their breathing devices.

Observers speculate that the flight had a specific objective and was not meant to be a long-duration mission. In any case, fuel for the station to maneuver was too depleted to attempt a long mission. The crew continued the research started by the Soyuz 21 crew, performed Earth resources work, biological and materials experiments. But, being a part of the Almaz military Salyut program, other unrevealed projects were likely carried out. The flight would prove to be not only the final flight to a military Salyut station, but also the final all-military crew to be launched by the Soviets. On 21 February 1977, the crew performed an air-changing experiment, shown on TV, slowly venting air from one end of the station to the other while releasing 100 kg of air from tanks in the docked Soyuz orbital module. This was a test of the future air replenishment techniques to be carried out with Progress transports in subsequent space stations.

They began to activate the Soyuz 24 on 23 February 1977, then deactivate the space station, and undocked and landed near Arkalyk on 25 February 1977. The Soyuz landed in a blowing snowstorm and recovery crews could not locate the space capsule. As it turned out, the search and rescue beacon was unable to deploy due to being jammed shut from snow, so Gorbatko had to free it by hand.

On 26 February 1977, Salyut 5 ejected a research module. The research module, which was recovered on Soviet territory, containing exposed film and experiments carried out by the two crews who crewed the space station. The Salyut 5 space station was deorbited on 8 August 1977.

<text>Soyuz 25 (, &quot;Union 25&quot;) was an October 1977 Soviet crewed space flight, the first to the new Salyut 6 space station, which had been launched 10 days earlier. However, the mission was aborted when cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Valery Ryumin failed to engage the docking latches of the station despite five attempts. Lacking sufficient fuel to attempt a dock at the other end of the station and with battery power for only two days, they returned to Earth.

The failure led to a new rule whereby every crew had to have at least one person aboard who had previously flown in space.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission highlights==
Soyuz 25 was launched on 9 October 1977 with a crew of two cosmonauts to dock with the orbiting Salyut 6 space station, which had been launched 10 days earlier, on 29 September. The crew were to stay on board for about 90 days, which would break the Soviet space endurance record, and possibly the all-time record of 84 days held by the crew of Skylab 4. The station was a new version of a Salyut with modifications including a second docking port which allowed supply ships and other crews to visit during the duration of a mission.

The vehicle approached the station the next day, and it contacted the forward port, but the Soyuz craft failed to make a hard dock with the station. The cosmonauts told the ground crew that they had attempted to dock four times, but that the contact light failed to come on. While the crew waited in soft dock – the docking system probe was latched onto the Salyut docking drogue, but the probe had failed to retract and bring the craft together – the ground crew studied the problem.

On the 20th orbit, Kovalenko undocked the Soyuz, and attempted to dock for the fifth time during the 23rd orbit, but failed again. The decision was made to return to Earth, as the Soyuz was equipped with batteries designed to last about two days, and the craft lacked fuel to attempt to dock with the port on the opposite side of the station.

A news release was issued: &quot;At 07.09 Moscow time today (10 October) the automatic rendezvous of the Soyuz 25 ship and the Salyut 6 station was begun. From a distance of 120 metres, the vehicles performed a docking manoeuvre. Due to deviations from the planned procedure for docking, the link-up was called off. The crew has begun making preparations for a return to Earth.&quot;

The crew thus had to make an early reentry and landed northwest of Tselinograd, Kazakhstan on 11 October.

The failure was a serious blow to the Soviets, as their media had given the flight a high profile, noting that the flight had come from the same launchpad as Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1, and coincided with the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution.

The problem was traced later to a faulty mechanism on the Soyuz; this was not discovered until after the Soyuz 26 flight performed an EVA to inspect the second docking port on Salyut 6.

The mission failure resulted in a rule stating that future crews would include at least one cosmonaut who had already flown a space mission. This resulted in the all-rookie backup crew of Aleksandr Ivanchenkov and Yuri Romanenko being paired with veteran cosmonauts for future missions. The rule was not relaxed until 1994 and Soyuz TM-19.

<doc id="418030" wikidata="Q1052728" url="?curid=418030" title="PowerBook Duo">
<text>The PowerBook Duo is a line of subnotebooks manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from 1992 until 1997 as a more compact companion to the PowerBook line. Improving upon the PowerBook 100&#x27;s portability (its immediate predecessor and Apple&#x27;s third-smallest laptop), the Duo came in seven different models. They were the Duo 210, 230, 250, 270c, 280, 280c, and 2300c, with the 210 and 230 being the earliest, and the 2300c being the final version before the entire line was dropped in early 1997.

Weighing and slightly smaller than a sheet of paper at , and only thick, it was the lightest and smallest of all of Apple&#x27;s PowerBooks at the time, and remains one of Apple&#x27;s smallest notebooks ever produced. The Duo had the most in common with the original MacBook Air which only included one USB 2.0 port, one video port (requiring an adapter) and one speaker port, but no ability for expansion.

The PowerBook Duo line was replaced by the PowerBook 2400, which was slightly larger in size than the Duos, but still only the fifth-smallest behind the 12-inch PowerBook G4 which succeeded it as fourth-smallest. Although both featured much more onboard functionality, they lacked docking ability.

==Features==

The Duo line offered an ultraportable design that was light and functional for travel and expandable via its unique docking connector. However certain compromises were made to achieve this level of portability. The Duo series used an 88% of standard desktop-sized keyboard which was criticized for being difficult to type on. Likewise, the trackball was reduced in size from even that used on the PowerBook 100. The only usable port which came standard on the Duo was a dual printer/modem EIA-422 serial port.

There was a slot for an expensive, optional, internal 14.4 Express Modem and no provision for built-in Ethernet. This somewhat limited configuration meant the only way to move data in or out of the laptop in a stock configuration, without purchasing additional accessories, was via a relatively slow AppleTalk connection, which was not practical in the event of hard drive problems. Compensating for these limitations, the initial Duo offering provided for a considerably higher RAM limit of 24 MB (as compared to the 100 series&#x27; 14 MB), and a standard 80 MB hard drive (versus the 100&#x27;s 40 MB drive). The debut year for the Duo only offered a passive matrix display on both the mid-level and high-end models, in contrast to the high-end of the PowerBook 100 series - the PowerBook 170 and 180 (in which the Duos shared the same processors). With their crisp active matrix displays, both were already in great demand over the lower-powered models with passive matrix displays. The following year, Apple replaced the Duo models with both an active matrix display and a color active matrix display, the latter becoming the de facto standard of the PowerBook line. The respective Duo models are easily differentiated by their display method and processor. All other features are identical.

==Specifications==

The 200–series Duos were powered by either Motorola 68030 or 68LC040 processors, ranging from 25–33 MHz. When Apple debuted its next-generation PowerPC processors in 1994, it took over a year for the first PowerPC Duo (the 2300c) to debut. The original PowerPC 601, like the original 68040 before it, produced too much heat and consumed too much power for Apple to use in any laptop but, by the end of 1995, the more efficient PowerPC 603e had been developed, which was featured in the Duo 2300c and its full-size companion, the PowerBook 5300 series. The PowerPC 603e was designed for a 64–bit bus, but was engineered by Apple to run on an older 32–bit bus to maintain compatibility with the Duo Docks. This led to poor system and video performance.


==Docking stations==

PowerBook Duos lacked most common ports (featuring only one internal printer/modem serial port and an optional fax/modem card port). In their place was docking ability, accomplished via a unique 156-pin Processor Direct Slot (PDS) giving the docks full access to the Duo&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU) and data buses. Several dock options were offered by Apple and third parties.

===Duo Dock (M7779) (1992), Duo Dock II (1994), Duo Dock Plus (1995)===
This was the largest and most expensive dock for the PowerBook Duo, in a form factor common for that period: the Duo Dock (M7779) was first offered by Apple on October 19, 1992, and the similar docks presented by Compaq (as the LTE Lite Desktop Expansion Base) and IBM (as the 3550 Expansion Unit) were introduced in the same year. Unlike the smaller docks, or &quot;port replicators&quot; that plugged into the back of laptops, the listed docks pulled the laptop inside the dock&#x27;s metal and plastic case via an internal sliding mechanism (similar to that of a VHS recorder). The Duo Dock turned the PowerBook Duo into a full-size, AC-powered, fully functional desktop computer with all the standard ports. Like a desktop computer, the dock could physically support a heavy, high-resolution CRT display on top. The Duo Dock included a floppy drive on the side, two NuBus expansion slots, an optional floating-point unit (FPU), level 2 cache, a slot for more VRAM to enable more colors at higher resolutions, and space for a second hard drive.

The original Duo Dock was replaced by the Duo Dock II on May 16, 1994, which added AAUI networking and compatibility with the newer color-screen PowerBook Duos. A replacement lid was offered to allow use of the thicker color Duos with the original Duo Dock. 

The Dock II was followed by the Duo Dock Plus on May 15, 1995, which was identical to the Duo Dock II, but lacked the FPU and level 2 cache—which were not compatible with the 68LC040-processor Duo 280 and PowerPC-processor Duo 2300c. While the laptop&#x27;s LCD display obviously could not be opened when inside the dock, additional NuBus video cards could be installed to drive up to three monitors.

Aging Duo Docks are known to have problems with the failing of the capacitors which drive the docking mechanism. This is colloquially known as &#x27;The Duo Dock Tick of Death&#x27;.

===MiniDock (M7780) (1992)===
The Mini Dock was a port expander for the PowerBook Duo and was popularly offered by many third-party manufacturers and Apple. When attached, the PowerBook Duo could be plugged into various standard desktop devices including SCSI, Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), serial, floppy disk, external speakers, and an external display. This type of dock also allowed the Duo&#x27;s internal LCD and battery to be used. Third-party contributions to the Mini Dock added a variety of specialized custom options including Ethernet connectivity, NTSC and PAL video ports. The only significant difference between these docks and a full desktop configuration was the lack of custom PDS or NuBus expansion slots, which were included on all standard desktop Macs, a shortfall made up in task-specific third-party dock offerings.

===MicroDock===
This type of dock was manufactured by both Apple and many third parties, and gave the PowerBook Duo up to three extra ports in a minimal configuration. Examples include floppy, SCSI, video and Ethernet docks, each typically included one ADB port as well. This was the least expensive, and most basic of the docks. This type of dock allowed the Duo&#x27;s internal LCD to be used as well, and could run on the Duo&#x27;s internal battery for a reduced amount of time. Popular due to the minimal impact in accessories that must be carried with the Duo, they offered a practical alternative to emergency hard disk and software situations and task-specific needs.

==Design==

The 2300 was the last Apple product to carry any vestige of the Snow White design language, which Apple had been phasing out since 1990. Drawing heavily upon improvements made to the original PowerBook 140 design, the Duo series continues many of the styling traits of the PowerBook 100, which is approximately equivalent in size and weight. In addition to the Snow White features, the Duo takes the 100&#x27;s radius curves a step further along the display top, front, and sides, and which is also heavily mirrored in the various docks.

===PenLite===

The PenLite was an early tablet computer prototyped by Apple Computer in 1993 around the same time as the Apple Newton. It was not a PDA but rather a complete computer. The project was canceled in 1994 due to its similarity to the Newton.

The PenLite was based on the PowerBook Duo and was meant to be a tablet-style addition, with a stylus as the input device. It was designed to be compatible with PowerBook Duo docks and accessories and ran the standard classic Mac OS.

==In popular culture==
One of the most stylish and iconic of the laptops available at the time, the Duo was widely used in advertising, film and television.

* In the TV sitcom Home Improvement, a Powerbook Duo was used in the fifth episode of season 6 (Episode #131: &quot;Al&#x27;s Video&quot; - Original air date: October 15, 1996) as Jill&#x27;s new computer. Just as she gets some work done on it, Tim comes along and destroys it by playing a game.
* Anne Heche, playing Amy Barnes, a geologist and seismologist, uses a PowerBook Duo 280c in the movie &quot;Volcano&quot; (1997) to calculate the speed of lava flowing beneath the city streets.
* In the film &quot;Wag The Dog&quot; (1997), the President&#x27;s team members, including Anne Heche and Dustin Hoffman among others, use several PowerBook Duo 280c.
* In the critically acclaimed TV sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot; (1994-1999), Dave Nelson used a PowerBook Duo almost exclusively for the first four seasons, the only exceptions being the first few episodes in which he used a PowerBook 100 series. In the fourth season (beginning in 1997), PowerBook Duos were also used prominently by Lisa Miller and occasionally by other characters. In the fifth season (beginning in 1998), all computers on the show were replaced with PowerBook G3s and a first-generation iMac.
* A complete PowerBook Duo system, including Dock, is featured prominently throughout seasons five through seven of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.
* In the movie &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995), Kate Libby owns a PowerBook Duo 280c (with a 2300c logic board infamously remarked to have a &quot;28.8 bps modem&quot; The 28.8 for the 2300 was never produced and remained a prototype only). She claims it has a &quot;P6 chip&quot;. While people believed she was referring to the Intel Pentium Pro, it was actually a PowerPC 603e in the 2300 motherboard (which was referred to by Apple as the &quot;P6&quot; chip for marketing purposes.) Dade Murphy is sent a clear-cased prototype 280c[1] by Eugene &quot;The Plague&quot; Belford.
* Denzel Washington, playing Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling in &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996), drafts a letter using a Powerbook Duo 250.

<doc id="418035" wikidata="Q1416201" url="?curid=418035" title="Vistula Veneti">
<text>The Vistula Veneti, also called Baltic Veneti, Venedi or Venethi, were an Indo-European people that inhabited the lands of central Europe east of the Vistula River and the Bay of Gdańsk. Ancient Roman geographers first mentioned in the 1st century AD, differentiating a group of peoples whose manner and language differed from those of the neighbouring Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. In the 6th century AD, Byzantine historians described the Veneti as the ancestors of the Slavs who, during the second phase of the Migration Period, crossed the northern frontiers of the Byzantine Empire. 

== Roman historical sources ==

Pliny the Elder places the Veneti along the Baltic coast. He calls them the Sarmatian Venedi (Latin: &quot;Sarmatae Venedi&quot;). Thereafter, the 2nd century Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy in his section on Sarmatia, places the Greater &quot;Ouenedai&quot; along the entire &quot;Venedic Bay&quot;, which is equivalent to the southern shores of the Baltic. He names tribes south of the Greater Venedae along the eastern bank of the Vistula and further east.

The most exhaustive Roman treatment of the Veneti comes in &quot;Germania&quot; by Tacitus, who writing in AD 98, places the Veneti among the peoples on the eastern fringe of Germania. He was uncertain of their ethnic identity, classifying them as Germanic based on their way of life, but not based on their language (in comparison to, for example, the Peucini):
&quot;Here Suebia ends. I do not know whether to class the tribes of the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni with the Germans or with the Sarmatians. The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like Germans in their language, manner of life, and mode of settlement and habitation. Squalor is universal among them and their nobles are indolent. Mixed marriages are giving them something of the repulsive appearance of the Sarmatians. The Venedi have adopted many Sarmatian habits; for their plundering forays take them over all the wooded and mountainous highlands that lie between the Peucini and the Fenni. Nevertheless, they are on the whole to be classed as Germans; for they have settled homes, carry shields, and are fond of travelling—and travelling fast on foot—differing in all these respects from the Sarmatians, who live in wagons or on horseback. The Fenni are astonishingly savage and disgustingly poor.&quot;

== Byzantine historical sources ==

Among the Byzantine authors, the Gothic author Jordanes in his work &quot;Getica&quot; (written in 550 or 551 AD) describes the Veneti as a &quot;populous nation&quot; whose dwellings begin at the sources of the Vistula and occupy &quot;a great expanse of land&quot;. He describes them as the ancestors of the Sclaveni (a people who appeared on the Byzantine frontier in the early 6th century and who were the early South Slavs) and of the Antes (East Slavs). Specifically, he states that the Sclaveni and the Antes used to be called the Veneti, but are now &quot;chiefly&quot; (though, by implication, not exclusively) called Sclaveni and Antes. He places the Sclaveni north of a line from the Dniestr to Lake Musianus, the location of which is unclear, but which has been variously identified with Lake Constance, the Tisa–Danube marshes or the Danube delta. He also places the Antes to the east of the Sclaveni.

Later in &quot;Getica&quot;, he returns to the Veneti by stating that though &quot;off-shoots of one stock [these people] have now three names, that is Veneti, Antes and Sclaveni&quot; and noting that they, at one time, had been conquered by the Goths under Ermanaric. Consistent with the view that the Veneti were an umbrella term for these three peoples, he later also recalls the defeat of the Antes at the hands of a Gothic chieftain named Vinitharius, i.e., conqueror of the Veneti.

Though Jordanes is the only author to explicitly associate the Veneti with the Sclaveni and Antes, the Tabula Peutingeriana, originating from the 3rd to the 4th century AD, separately mentions the &quot;Venedi&quot; on the northern bank of the Danube somewhat upstream of its mouth and the &quot;Venadi Sarmatae&quot; along the Baltic coast.

== Archaeology ==
In the region identified by Ptolemy and Pliny, east of the Vistula and adjoining the Baltic, there was an Iron Age culture known to archaeologists as the West Baltic Cairns Culture or West Baltic Barrow Culture, and the Przeworsk and Zarubintsy cultures east of the Vistula river. The Baltic cultures are associated with the Proto-Balts. These herders lived in small settlements or in little lake dwellings built on artificial islands made of several layers of wooden logs attached by stakes. Their metals were imported, and their dead were cremated and put in urns covered by small mounds. The Przeworsk and Zarubintsy cultures are associated with Proto-Slavs, though the Przeworsk culture was a mix of several tribal societies and is also often linked to the Germanic tribe of Vandals.

== Ethnolinguistic character ==
During the Middle Ages the region east of the mouth of the Vistula river 
was inhabited by people speaking Old Prussian, a now-extinct Baltic language in an area described by Tacitus in AD 98 as &quot;Suebian Sea, which washes the country of the Aestii, who have the same customs and fashions as the Suebi&quot;. It is unknown what language the yet further east Veneti spoke, although the implication of Tacitus&#x27; description of them is that it was &quot;not&quot; a form of Germanic.

=== Proto-Slavic and Baltic languages ===
Linguists agree that Slavic languages evolved in close proximity with the Baltic languages. The two language families probably evolved from a common ancestor, a phylogenetic Proto-Balto/Slavic language continuum. The earliest origins of Slavs seem to lie in the area between the Middle Dnieper and the Bug rivers, where the most archaic Slavic hydronyms have been established. The vocabulary of Proto-Slavic had a heterogenous character and there is evidence that in the early stages of its evolution it adopted some loanwords from centum-type Indo-European languages. It has been proposed that contacts of Proto-Slavs with the &quot;Veneti&quot; may have been one of the sources for these borrowings. The aforementioned area of proto-Slavic hydronyms roughly corresponds with the Zarubintsy archeological culture which has been interpreted as the most likely locus of the ethnogenesis of Slavs. According to Polish archaeologist Michał Parczewski, Slavs began to settle in southeastern Poland no earlier than the late 5th century AD, the Prague culture being their recognizable expression.

==Historic references to the Early Slavs==
Modern historians most often link the Veneti to Early Slavs, based on Jordanes&#x27; writings from the 6th century:
It is also clear that the Franks in later centuries (see, e.g., Life of Saint Martinus, Fredegar&#x27;s Chronicle, Gregory of Tours), Lombards (see, e.g., Paul the Deacon), and Anglo-Saxons (see Widsith&#x27;s Song) referred to Slavs both in the Elbe-Saal region and in Pomerania generally, as &quot;Wenden&quot; or &quot;Winden&quot; (see &quot;Wends&quot;), which was a later corruption of the word Veneti. Likewise, the Franks and Bavarians of Styria and Carinthia referred to their Slavic neighbours as &quot;Windische&quot;.

It has not been shown that either the original Veneti or the Slavs themselves used the ethnonym &quot;Veneti&quot; to describe their ethnos. Of course, other peoples, e.g. the Germans (called so first by the Romans), did not have a name for themselves other than localized tribal names.

== Controversies ==
Roland Steinacher states that &quot;The name Veneder was introduced by Jordanes. The assumption that these were Slavs can be traced back to the 19th century to Pavel Josef Šafařík from Prague, who tried to establish a &quot;Slavic Origin&quot;. Scholars and historians since then viewed the reports on &quot;Venedi/Venethi&quot; by Tacitus, Pliny and Ptolemy as the earliest historical attestation of Slavs. &quot;Such conceptions, started in the 16th century, resurfaced in the 19th century where they provided the basis for interpretations of the history and origins of Slavs.&quot;

Considering Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Ouenedai&quot; and their location along the Baltic sea, the German linguist, Alexander M. Schenker, asserts that the vocabulary of the Slavic languages shows no evidence that the early Slavs were exposed to the sea. Schenker claims that Proto-Slavic had no maritime terminology and further claims it even lacked a word for amber. Based on this belief, and the fact that Ptolemy refers to the Baltic Sea as the &quot;Venedic&quot; Bay, Schenker decides against a possible identification of the &quot;Veneti&quot; of Ptolemy&#x27;s times, with today&#x27;s Slavs. According to Gołąb, Schenker&#x27;s conclusion is supported by the fact that to the east of the &quot;Venedae&quot;, Ptolemy mentions two further tribes called &quot;Stavanoi&quot; (Σταυανοί) and &quot;Souobenoi&quot; (Σουοβενοι), both of which have been interpreted as possibly the oldest historical attestations of at least some Slavs.

Others scholars have interpreted these as Prussian tribes (Sudini) as they follow other known Prussian tribes in Ptolemy&#x27;s listing (e.g., the Galindae (Γαλίνδαι)). Moreover, that conclusion (Gołąb, Schenker), if correct, may only account for the Byzantine Slavs of Jordanes and Procopius since Jordanes clearly (see above) understands Veneti as a group at least as broad as today&#x27;s Slavs but does not understand the converse to be the case (i.e., his &quot;Slavs&quot; are localized around Byzantium and north through Moravia only) since his Slavs remain a subset of the broader category of Veneti. It also is clear that the Byzantine term &quot;Slav&quot; had gradually replaced the Germanic &quot;Winden&quot;/&quot;Wenden&quot; as applied to all the people we would, today, consider Slavs.

It has been argued that the &quot;Veneti&quot; were a centum Indo-European people, rather than satem Baltic-speakers. Zbigniew Gołąb considers that the hydronyms of the Vistula and Odra river basins had a North-West Indo-European character with close affinities to the Italo-Celtic branch, but different from the Germanic branch, and show similarities with those attested in the area of the Adriatic Veneti (in Northeastern Italy) as well as those attested in the Western Balkans that are attributed to Illyrians, which points to a possible connection between these ancient Indo-European peoples.

In the 1980s and 1990s some Slovene authors proposed a theory according to which the &quot;Veneti&quot; were Proto-Slavs and bearers of the Lusatian culture along the Amber Path who settled the region between the Baltic Sea and Adriatic Sea and included the Adriatic Veneti, as presented in their book &quot;Veneti – First Builders of European Community&quot;. This theory would place the Veneti as a pre-Celtic, pre-Latin and pre-Germanic population of Europe. The theory is rejected by mainstream historians and linguists.

<doc id="418037" wikidata="Q1734740" url="?curid=418037" title="Leyton tube station">
<text>Leyton () is a London Underground station in Leyton, in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, East London. Located on Leyton High Road, adjacent to the A12, the station is on the Central line between Stratford and Leytonstone stations. It is in Travelcard zone 3.

==Location==
Leyton Mills Retail Park, Leyton Library, New Spitalfields Market, Leyton Orient F.C. stadium, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery are within proximity of the station. Around Leyton station, the line runs parallel to the A12 road, while the station entrance is connected by the A112. It serves the area of the name itself, situated to the north of the A12 in the London Borough of Waltham Forest. Leyton is largely residential, with houses built from 1870 to 1910. The origin of its name was derived from its geographical location, being at the &quot;tun&quot; of the river Lea, and the ancient parish was named Low Leyton. To the south, it covers the Cathall housing estate in Leytonstone.

==History==
The railway line from Loughton Branch Junction (on the Lea Valley line between and ) to Loughton was built by the Eastern Counties Railway, and opened on 22 August 1856. A station at Leyton was opened on the same day, and was originally named &quot;Low Leyton&quot;. It was renamed Leyton on 27 November 1867 by the Great Eastern Railway. The current station buildings largely date from the reconstruction of 1879, which saw the original level crossing replaced by a bridge, although some alterations were carried out in connection with the transfer of the station from the London &amp; North Eastern Railway to London Underground as part of the eastern extensions of the Central line.

When the Central line (then known as the Central London Railway) was amalgamated under the management of London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, plans for major expansions to the line were developed. The station was first served by the Central line on 5 May 1947, as part of the extension of the line to Leytonstone.

In the 1990s, the northern ticket office and entrance – dating from 1901 – were removed as part of the controversial M11 extension (now the A12) that was built adjacent to the station. In the mid-2000s, the station was comprehensively refurbished as part of the London Underground PPP.

=== Planned upgrade and step free access ===
According to TfL, the station is severely overcrowded at peak periods, due to the small ticket hall (as a result of the station&#x27;s location on top of the bridge over the tracks), and the proximity of the ticket barriers to the narrow pavement outside the station. In 2011, it was announced the capacity of the station would be increased, in order to cope with the predicted additional users of the station during the 2012 Olympic Games, and to ease the existing congestion. This work would have created a new access to Goodall Road from the westbound platform. This work never materialised.

In 2019, it was announced that Waltham Forest and Transport for London would fund a £18million expansion and upgrade of the station, including step free access. This work will involve construction of a new, larger ticket hall north of the current one, a new footbridge, wider stairs and step free access to both platforms. The existing ticket hall building would then be repurposed as a retail unit by TFL Property. In 2020, a funding agreement between Waltham Forest and TFL was signed, with works estimated to begin in 2021 – with completion by 2023.

<text>The Evangelical Mennonite Mission Conference (EMMC) is an evangelical body of Mennonite Christians, organized on July 1, 1959.

The EMMC was formed from the &quot;Rudnerweider Mennonite Church&quot;, which was organized in 1937. The &quot;Rudnerweider Mennonite Church&quot; arose in a revival that placed great emphasis on personal conversion, evangelism and missions, and split the Sommerfelder Mennonite Church in Manitoba. The conference is currently (2017) made up of 23 congregations in Canada (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Saskatchewan), three in Belize, and two in Mexico. Offices are in Winnipeg, Manitoba. A convention is held annually. The EMMC is a member of the Mennonite World Conference.

<doc id="418041" wikidata="Q965936" url="?curid=418041" title="Macintosh Color Classic">
<text>The Macintosh Color Classic (sold as the Macintosh Colour Classic in PAL regions) is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from February 1993 to May 1995 (up to January 1998 in PAL markets). It has an all-in-one design, with a small, integrated 10″ Sony Trinitron display at 512 × 384 pixel resolution. The display is capable of supporting up to thousands of colors with a video memory upgrade.

A slightly updated model, the Color Classic II, featuring the Macintosh LC 550 logic board with a 33 MHz processor, was released in Japan, Canada and some international markets in 1993, sometimes as the Performa 275.

The Color Classic is the final model of the original &quot;compact&quot; family of Macintosh computers, and was replaced by the larger-display Macintosh LC 500 series and Power Macintosh 5200 LC.

== Hardware ==
The Color Classic has a Motorola 68030 CPU running at 16 MHz and has a logic board similar to the Macintosh LC II.

Like the Macintosh SE and SE/30 before it, the Color Classic has a single expansion slot: an LC-type Processor Direct Slot (PDS), incompatible with the SE slots. This was primarily intended for the Apple IIe Card (the primary reason for the Color Classic&#x27;s switchable 560 × 384 display, essentially quadruple the IIe&#x27;s 280 × 192 High-Resolution graphics), which was offered with education models of the LCs. The card allowed the LCs to emulate an Apple IIe. The combination of the low-cost color Macintosh and Apple IIe compatibility was intended to encourage the education market&#x27;s transition from Apple II models to Macintoshes. Other cards, such as CPU accelerators, Ethernet and video cards were also made available for the Color Classic&#x27;s Processor Direct Slot.

The Color Classic shipped with the Apple Keyboard known as an Apple Keyboard II (M0487) which featured a soft power switch on the keyboard itself. The mouse supplied was the Apple Mouse known as the Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II (M2706).

A slightly updated model, the Color Classic II, featuring the Macintosh LC 550 logic board with a 33 MHz processor, was released in Japan, Canada and some international markets in 1993, sometimes as the Performa 275. Both versions of the Color Classic have 256 KB of onboard VRAM, expandable to 512 KB by plugging a 256 KB VRAM SIMM into the onboard 68-pin VRAM slot.

The name &quot;Color Classic&quot; was not printed directly on the front panel, but on a separate plastic insert. This enabled the alternative spelling &quot;Colour Classic&quot; and &quot;Colour Classic II&quot; to be used in appropriate markets.

===Upgrades===
Powered by a Motorola 68030 processor, the Color Classic can only go up to Mac OS 7.6.1. However, some Color Classic users upgraded their machines with motherboards from Performa/LC 575 units (&quot;Mystic&quot; upgrade), while others have put entire Performa/LC/Quadra 630 or successor innards into them (&quot;Takky&quot; upgrade). Another common modification to this unit was to change the display to allow 640 × 480 resolution, which was a common requirement for many programs (especially games) to run.

With the Mystic mod, the Color Classic uses the motherboard of the Macintosh LC 575 which has a Motorola 68LC040 CPU (at a speed of 33 MHz instead of 25 MHz) and is pin compatible with the Color Classic. A Color Classic with the Mystic upgrade can go up to Mac OS 8.1 (Mac OS 8.6 and newer require PowerPC processors).

With the Takky mod, the case and connector need to be modded, but doing so will allow the use of a PowerPC 601, 603, or 604 equipped motherboard. A Color Classic with the Takky upgrade can go up to Mac OS 9.1 (Mac OS 9.2 and newer require a G3 processor). On Takky Color Classics, there is a way to upgrade the processor with a G3 CPU, but it will only go up to Mac OS 9.2.2 as Mac OS X isn&#x27;t officially supported.

<doc id="418044" wikidata="Q5463509" url="?curid=418044" title="Flying Saucers (magazine)">
<text>Flying Saucers was a monthly magazine published and edited by Raymond A. Palmer, devoted to articles on UFOs and the Shaver Mystery.

==History==
The magazine was first published as &quot;Flying Saucers from Other Worlds&quot; in 1957, before evolving into &quot;Flying Saucers&quot; in 1958. The initial title was designed to create confusion with a science fiction magazine &quot;Other Worlds&quot;, which Palmer also published and which overlapped for two issues. Such confusion may have been designed to overcome the difficulty that a new magazine in a new category would have in finding space on news stands, to help attract readership, or more likely both. The confusion continues to tax magazine collectors to this day.

&quot;Flying Saucers From Other Worlds&quot; was first published in June 1957 and cost 35 cents an issue. The editorial by Ray Palmer on page 4 begins with &quot;This is the first Flying Saucers From Other Worlds. Ray A. Palmer was Editor, Gray Barker was Eastern Editor and August C. Roberts was Photo Editor. Col. Ron Ormond was Western Editor several issues later. The front cover of issue number one was a composite from the movies Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;Captive Women&quot;. The editorial address was in Amherst, Wisconsin. The magazine itself was published by Palmer Publications, Inc. in Evanston, Illinois.

The &quot;Flying Saucers From Other Worlds&quot; May 1958 Issue No. 29 was the last one by that title. In the July–August 1958 Issue No. 30 the name of the magazine was changed to &quot;Flying Saucers, The Magazine of Space Conquest&quot;. Ray Palmer was still editor at that time. The title was later changed to &quot;Flying Saucers, Mysteries of the Space Age&quot; and the magazine continued until June 1976 when it ceased publication.

<text>Bradford was a computer program written and sold in the 1980s by Aaron Contorer and his firm, Contorer Computing. It was one of the first programs sold using the shareware marketing model. 

Available for both CP/M and MS-DOS operating systems, it greatly increased the quality of printing on a dot matrix printer and included a range of fonts.

Though popular for several years, &quot;Bradford&quot;, along with similar products, became obsolete as Windows 3.1 included much more powerful support for attractive printing.

<doc id="418046" wikidata="Q1358685" url="?curid=418046" title="Simón Rodríguez">
<text>Simón Rodríguez (October 28, 1769, Caracas, Venezuela – February 28, 1854, Amotape, Peru), known during his exile from Spanish America as Samuel Robinson, was a Venezuelan philosopher and educator, notably Simón Bolívar&#x27;s tutor and mentor.

His mother, Rosalia Rodríguez, was the daughter of an owner of farms and livestock; her father was originally from the Canary Islands. 

==Career in Venezuela== 

In May 1791, the Caracas Council (Cabildo) gave him a position as teacher in the &quot;Reading and Writing School for Children&quot;. In 1794, he presented his critical writing &quot;Reflection on the flaws vitiating the Reading and Writing School for Children in Caracas and Means of Achieving its Reform and a New Establishment&quot; to the council, which represented an original approach to a modern school system. His role in the failed Gual and España conspiracy against the Spanish crown in 1797 forced him to leave Venezuela.

==Exile==

In Kingston, Jamaica he changed his name to Samuel Robinson, and after staying some years in the United States he traveled to France (1801). There, in 1804, he met his former protégé, Simón Bolivar; together they made a long journey across Europe. They witnessed the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte in Milan, as King of Italy and in Rome, witnessed how Bolívar took his famous oath that he would liberate all of America from the Spanish Crown, and registered it for history:
&quot;I swear before you; I swear on my parent’s God; I swear on them; I swear on my honor; and I swear on my Motherland; that I won’t give rest to my arm, nor repose to my soul, until I have broken the chains that oppress us by will of the Spanish power.&quot;

Rodríguez returned to America in 1823, using his name &quot;Simón Rodríguez&quot; again. In Colombia he established the first workshop-school in 1824. He was called to Peru by Simón Bolívar and became &quot;Director for Public Education, Physical and Mathematical Sciences and Arts&quot; and &quot;Director of Mines, Agriculture and Public Roads&quot; of Bolivia.

In 1826, Rodríguez established a second workshop-school, as part of a project for all Bolivia. But Antonio José de Sucre, president of Bolivia since October 1826, did not have a good relationship with him, and Rodríguez resigned the same year, working during the rest of his life as educator and writer, living alternatively in different places of Peru, Chile and Ecuador. His work &quot;Sociedades Americanas&quot; (&quot;American Societies&quot;) was divided in several issues and published in Arequipa (1828), in Concepción (1834), Valparaíso (1838), and Lima (1842).

==Last years and legacy==
Most of Rodríguez&#x27;s written works remained in Guayaquil, Ecuador, but were lost in the large city fire of 1896. Rodriguez is the face on the 50 Bolivar Fuerte bills. He was also the face in the old 20,000 Bolívar bills (until 2007). One of the Bolivarian Missions of Hugo Chávez, Mission Robinson, is named for him.

==Tribute==
On October 28, 2018, Rodríguez was honoured with a Google Doodle posthumously on his 249th birthday.

<doc id="418058" wikidata="Q2732407" url="?curid=418058" title="DeMolay International">
<text>DeMolay International is a youth leadership organization with Masonic origins for young men ages 12 to 21. There is in select areas a &quot;Squire&quot; program for those younger than 12. It was founded in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1919 and named for Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. DeMolay was incorporated in the 1990s and is classified by the IRS as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization.

DeMolay is open for membership to young men between the ages of 12 and 21 who acknowledge a higher spiritual power. It has about 12,000 active members spread throughout every continent except for Antarctica. There are active chapters in Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Argentina, Aruba, French Guiana, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador (affiliated to Peru jurisdiction), Italy, Romania, Greece (affiliated to Romania jurisdiction), France, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia (affiliated to Serbia jurisdiction), Bulgaria and the United States.

Although young women are not permitted to join the organization, chapters are permitted to elect chapter &quot;sweethearts&quot; and &quot;princesses.&quot;

While DeMolay is a youth organization for young men, the Rainbow Girls and Job&#x27;s Daughters are similar Masonic-related organizations for young women.

== Founding ==
The Order of DeMolay was founded in 1919 with nine members, most of whom lived near each other in Kansas City.

The crown appearing in the emblem of the order contains 10 rubies, each representing one of the original nine members and the organization&#x27;s founder, Frank S. Land. Frank S. Land was a member of Ivanhoe Lodge No. 446. The rubies were originally portrayed as pearls; as each founding member died, the pearl representing him was changed to a ruby.

== Values ==
DeMolay has seven &quot;Cardinal Virtues&quot;, taught as its basic ideals. The Order calls for every member to live according to these Virtues, which are considered as the things that distinguish a good leader and a good man. They are:

*Filial love: the love and the kindness we should have with our parents, the ones that gave us birth and taught us the first lessons of kindness, respect and belief in God. 
*Reverence for sacred things: a belief in a supreme being (independent of a specific religion) and respect for others’ beliefs. 
*Courtesy: kindness, respect, and philanthropy
*Comradeship: being a faithful friend, not only in good times but also in hard times.
*Fidelity: the strength to follow one&#x27;s own values and virtues, and to keep secret everything which is entrusted to one; faithfulness to God, one&#x27;s homeland, and one&#x27;s friends, as Jacques DeMolay preferred to die rather than betray his companions or break with his pledge.
*Cleanliness: purity in soul and heart, and a clear conscience, keeping your mind away from everything that is against the values of a good citizen. 
*Patriotism: respect for, and the willingness to defend, our homeland, our democracy, our state and our city, including the preservation of public spaces and places, such as schools, asylums, orphanages and hospitals, that support people in need.

DeMolay defends three fundamental freedoms:

* Religious Freedom: represented by any holy book, independent of the religion
* Civil Freedom: represented by the national flag
* Intellectual Freedom: represented by the Scholar Books

DeMolay has an Ethical Code, composed of the following statements:

* A DeMolay serves God.
* A DeMolay honors all womanhood.
* A DeMolay loves and honors his parents.
* A DeMolay is honest.
* A DeMolay is loyal to ideals and friends.
* A DeMolay practices honest toil.
* A DeMolay&#x27;s word is as good as his bond.
* A DeMolay is courteous.
* A DeMolay is at all times a gentleman.
* A DeMolay is a patriot in peace as well as war.
* A DeMolay is clean in mind and body.
* A DeMolay stands unswervingly for the public schools.
* A DeMolay always bears the reputation of a good and law-abiding citizen.
* A DeMolay by precept and example must preserve the high standards to which he has pledged himself.
The organization&#x27;s motto is &quot;No DeMolay shall fail as a citizen, as a leader and as a man.&quot;

== Organizational structure ==
A local DeMolay body is known as a Chapter and is headed by the Master Councilor. The Master Councilor is elected by members of his Chapter and is usually among the older members of the group. The Master Councilor is assisted in his duties by a Senior Councilor and a Junior Councilor. The remaining officers of a Chapter are appointed by the Master Councilor, except for the Scribe, who is appointed by the Chapter&#x27;s advisory council.

Adult men mentor and supervise the Chapter. These men are often Masons or Senior DeMolays, or previous members who reached the age of 21, but can also be other men in the community, including the fathers of active members. Women can also serve as Advisors.

In addition to the individual Chapter, DeMolay has an officer structure at the state, provincial, or other large regional level led by a &quot;State Master Councilor&quot;, &quot;Provincial Master Councilor&quot;, or &quot;Jurisdictional Master Councilor&quot;. In some countries, DeMolay may have a national level organization headed by a &quot;National Master Councilor&quot;. There are also other state, provincial, or jurisdictional positions, based on the officers of a chapter, which vary for each jurisdiction. The lead advisor, who must be a Master Mason and a member of the Supreme Council, in a state, jurisdiction, or country, is called an &quot;Executive Officer.&quot; The lead advisor internationally is known as a &quot;Grand Master,&quot; who governs the International Supreme Council. There are also Active DeMolay officers at an international level; the &quot;International Master Councilor&quot; and &quot;International Congress Secretary &quot; are the heads of the International DeMolay Congress. These officers are always past Jurisdictional Master Councilors.

In the US, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, President Harry S. Truman, and President Gerald R. Ford have been Honorary Grand Masters of the Order of DeMolay.

===Female youth leaders===
Some DeMolay Chapters elect young women to positions of leadership, who act to support members and their activities. These positions are not officially recognized by DeMolay International; they are approved subject to the authority of the Executive Officer in the jurisdiction.

==== Sweetheart ====
DeMolay Chapters may elect a &quot;Chapter Sweetheart&quot; to serve as the female representative of the Chapter, although she is not an initiated member of DeMolay. Her duties may include attending Chapter functions and acting as an ambassador of DeMolay. Members of Job&#x27;s Daughters, Rainbow for Girls, and other Masonic Youth Organizations for young women are often considered for this position.

==== Chapter Princess ====
A Chapter may also elect a Chapter Princess. The program generally uses the same requirements as set forth for the Sweetheart. Her duties generally include attending Chapter functions and acting as an ambassador of DeMolay while assisting the Sweetheart in her duties.

==== Chapter Duchess ====
A Chapter may also elect two Chapter Duchesses. The program generally uses the same requirements set forth for the Sweetheart. Her duties generally include attending Chapter functions and acting as an ambassador of DeMolay while assisting both the Sweetheart and Princess in their duties.

==== Chapter Little Sis ====
A Little Sis is usually 14–16 years old. She generally assists both the Princess and the Sweetheart in their duties.

==Jurisdictional officers==
Each state or jurisdiction holds an annual (or biennial, in some) event known as a Conclave or Convention. At this event, the members of the state or jurisdiction may vote on the State Master Councilor (or, in some cases the Provincial Master Councilor / Jurisdictional Master Councilor) and other elected positions. Some jurisdictions may elect a Deputy State Master Councilor, Sweetheart, or various other positions. In some cases, these officers are appointed by the executive officer of jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may hold a specific event, called Congress, separate and apart from Conclave or Convention to elect their jurisdictional officers and vote on any changes to the jurisdictional by-laws, then install the new officers at their Conclave or Convention.

Jurisdictional/State Officers are the leaders of their state/jurisdiction. They plan, lead, and execute all of the events happening in their state. They also serve as a resource for the DeMolays in their state to help them with events, ceremonies, and any other DeMolay related activities.

==International leadership==
The International Supreme Council is the governing body of DeMolay International. It is composed of adult leaders from around the world who are responsible for the management of DeMolay. The Grand Master, the Grand Senior Councilor, the Grand Junior Councilor, the Grand Secretary, and the Grand Treasurer are the elected leaders of the International Supreme Council. In certain parts of the world, such as Brazil, for example, DeMolay International has created daughter Supreme Councils and has ceded local control of DeMolay in those regions to the local Supreme Council.

===Officers of DeMolay International===

The DeMolay Congress is the Senate-style body where two voting delegates represent each DeMolay jurisdiction. The delegates meet once a year and elect an International Master Councilor and an International Congress Secretary, who lead and serve as the heads of the body for a time span of one year. Two Active DeMolays, usually the International Master Councilor and International Congress Secretary, are elected as voting members of the board of directors annually. Additionally, delegates discuss and vote on legislative issues.

=== International Congress officers ===
== Adult supervision ==
Each chapter must be sponsored by a local Masonic body or some other group composed exclusively of Masons. The sponsoring body is responsible for providing the chapter with adult advisors and a place to meet. Members of the sponsoring body form the chapter&#x27;s initial &quot;advisory council&quot;. The advisory council selects one of its members to be its chairman, and he is the official liaison between the chapter and the sponsoring body. Another member of the advisory council is designated the &quot;chapter advisor,&quot; and he is the official liaison between the advisory council and the chapter. The chapter&#x27;s advisory council is responsible for supervising the chapter and its activities.

==Activities==
DeMolays participate in a wide range of activities that may include, but are not limited to: camping, holding joint events with members of Rainbow and Job&#x27;s Daughters, various sports, and taking long-distance trips. Both Chapters and individual DeMolays can participate in competitions at state and international events.

<doc id="418061" wikidata="Q772220" url="?curid=418061" title="Beringer's Lying Stones">
<text>Beringer&#x27;s Lying Stones () are pieces of limestone which were carved into the shape of various fictitious animals and &quot;discovered&quot; in 1725 by Johann Bartholomeus Adam Beringer (1667–1740), Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Würzburg. Beringer believed them to be fossils, and because some of them bore the name of God in Hebrew, suggested that they might be of divine origin. The scientific community at the time was still unsure as to what fossils actually were, the notion that they were the petrified remains of once-living organisms being merely one of several competing hypotheses.

Beringer published a book on his findings but shortly after discovered that he had been the victim of a hoax. He took the hoaxers to court and won the case but his reputation was forever besmirched.

== Background ==

Johann Bartholomew Adam Beringer was born in 1667 to German physician Ludwig Behringer. Beringer held high positions including chief physician to the Julian Hospital and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University. In addition to all this, he took an interest in . He had hired Christian Zänger (aged 17), and the brothers Niklaus and Valentin Hehn (aged 18 and 14) to help him search for unusual rocks around Würzburg in 1725. J. Ignace Roderique, a professor of geography, algebra and analysis at the university, Johann Georg von Eckhart, librarian to the university, and Baron von Hof, a local noble, decided to prank the professor as he was considered arrogant. Roderique had figures carved in limestone and had them planted through one of Beringer&#x27;s assistants. To some of these stones, they added inscriptions such as the Hebrew name of God in Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew characters. They planted these stones on Mount Eibelstadt where Beringer and his assistants frequently went to search for fossils. Beringer began to find many such rocks and without suspecting them began to document them. The hoaxers carved fragments of limestone into shapes of animals such as lizards, frogs, and spiders on their webs.

Beringer published a book with illustrations of his findings &quot;Lithographiae Wirceburgensis&quot; (1726). Shortly after the book went into print, he realized that he had been duped and took legal action against Roderique and von Eckhart and won the case. The two were removed from their positions at the university and Roderique was banished from Würzburg but Beringer&#x27;s reputation was forever destroyed. Eckhart lost his post and privileges to use the library and archives. This hampered his own historical research, which was left unfinished at his death. The stones became known as &quot;Lügensteine&quot;, or &quot;lying stones&quot;. Some of the stones have survived to the present and a few are now on display at the Oxford University Museum, and Teylers Museum in the Netherlands.

In his book Beringer examined multiple hypotheses to explain the origin of the stones including that they were the remains of former life forms, formed inorganically, &quot;vis plastica&quot;, by special creative forces of divine nature or the &quot;capricious fabrications of God&quot;. He also considered the possibility that they were the carvings of prehistoric pagans, but he had to rule this out since pagans had no knowledge of the name of God. The idea that they were impressions of former living forms was supported in his time by the belief of the Biblical flood. Some critics had pointed out chisel marks on the rocks and Beringer noted that:
...the figures...are so exactly fitted to the dimensions of the stones, that one would swear that they are the work of a very meticulous sculptor...[and they] seem to bear unmistakable indications of the sculptor&#x27;s knife... One would swear that he discerned in many of them the strokes of a knife gone awry, and superfluous gouges in several directions.
However, this evidence of sculpting only convinced him more strongly that the chisel was wielded by the hand of God.

Some of the court transcript still exists, and in the testimony the hoaxers make clear that they did indeed want to discredit Beringer, because, they said, &quot;he was so arrogant and despised us all&quot;. A 2005 book suggests that Roderique may not have been responsible for the fabrications of the fossil since Roderique was posted to the University of Würzburg only on 11 December 1725 and was in Münster when the stones were found in the summer of 1725. The authors suggested that Beringer himself may have been responsible for the fraud. Beringer spent many years recovering copies of his book. A second printing of his book was made in 1767, well after his death and it was translated into English in 1963.

<doc id="418065" wikidata="Q3098911" url="?curid=418065" title="Stuyvesant High School">
<text>Stuyvesant High School ( ) is a co-ed, public, college-preparatory, specialized high school in Manhattan, New York City, New York. The school, commonly referred to among its students, faculty and alumni as &quot;Stuy&quot; ( ), specializes in developing talent in math, science and technology. Operated by the New York City Department of Education, specialized schools offer tuition-free, advanced classes to New York City high school students.

Stuyvesant High School was established in 1904 initially as an all-boys school in the East Village of lower Manhattan. Starting in 1934, admission for all applicants was contingent on passing an entrance examination. In 1969, after 65 years with an all-male student body, the high school started permanently accepting female students. In 1992, Stuyvesant High School moved to its current location at Battery Park City to accommodate more students. The old campus houses several smaller high schools and charter schools.

Admission to Stuyvesant involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, required for the New York City Public Schools system. Every March, approximately 800 to 850 applicants with the highest SHSAT scores are accepted, out of about 30,000 students who apply to Stuyvesant.

Extracurricular activities at the school include a Math Team, Speech and Debate Team, a yearly theater competition and various student publications including a newspaper, a yearbook, and literary magazines. Stuyvesant has educated four Nobel laureates. Notable alumni include former United States Attorney General Eric Holder, physicists Brian Greene and Lisa Randall, economist Thomas Sowell, mathematician Paul Cohen, chemist Roald Hoffmann, biologist Eric Lander, Oscar-winning actor James Cagney, comedian Billy Eichner, and chess grandmaster Robert Hess.

==History==

=== Planning ===
The then independent city of Brooklyn&#x27;s Superintendent of Schools, William Henry Maxwell, had first written in a report about the need to construct technical / scientific oriented secondary schools in Brooklyn and throughout New York state in 1887. This would follow other examples of specialized high schools such as the Baltimore Manual Training School, now the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. The municipal architect and engineer C. B. J. Snyder, who designed many of the city&#x27;s public school buildings, had repeatedly mentioned the need for more basic mathematical and scientific preparation in New York&#x27;s growing numbers of public secondary schools in the late 19th century. The first such school in the city was Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, which opened in 1893. By 1899, now positioned as the newly-formed City of Greater New York&#x27;s Superintendent of Public Schools, Maxwell was advocating for another specialized high school across the river in the newly established borough of Manhattan.

In January 1903 Maxwell and Snyder submitted a report to the New York City Board of Education in which they suggested the creation of a school in Manhattan. The Board of Education approved the plans in April 1904. They suggested that the school occupy a plot on East 15th Street, west of First Avenue. However, that plot did not yet contain a school building, and so the new school was initially housed within Public School #47&#x27;s former building at 225 East 23rd Street. The Board of Education also wrote that the new school would be &quot;designated as the Stuyvesant High School, as being reminiscent of the locality.&quot; Stuyvesant Square, Stuyvesant Street, and later Stuyvesant Town (which was built subsequently in 1947) are all located near the proposed 15th Street school building. All of these locations were named after Peter Stuyvesant (1610–1672), the last Dutch Director (governor) of New Netherland (and its major port town of New Amsterdam), 1647–1665, and owner of the area&#x27;s Stuyvesant Farm. The appellation of a specific historical name was selected to avoid confusion with Brooklyn&#x27;s earlier Manual Training High School.

=== Opening and boys&#x27; school ===
Stuyvesant High School opened in September 1904 as Manhattan&#x27;s first specialized high school. At the time of its opening, the school consisted of 155 students and 12 teachers.

At first, the school provided a core curriculum of &quot;English, Latin, modern languages, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, [and] music,&quot; as well as a physical education program and a more specialized track of &quot;woodworking, metalworking, mechanical drawing, [and] freehand drawing.&quot; However, in June 1908, Maxwell announced that the school&#x27;s core curriculum would be separated for the rest, and that a discrete trade school would operate in the Stuyvesant building during the evening. Thereafter, Stuyvesant became renowned for excellence in math and science. In 1909, eighty percent of the school&#x27;s alumni went to college, compared to other schools, which only sent 25% to 50% of their graduates to college.

By 1919 officials started restricting admission based on academic achievement. Stuyvesant implemented a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students: some students would attend in the morning, while others would take classes in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until Spring 1957. The school implemented a system of entrance examinations in 1934. The examination program, developed with the assistance of Columbia University, was expanded in 1938 to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science.

=== Co-educational school ===
In 1967 Alice de Rivera filed a lawsuit against the Board of Education, alleging that she had been banned from taking Stuyvesant&#x27;s entrance exam because of her gender. The lawsuit was decided in the student&#x27;s favor, and Stuyvesant was required to accept female students. The first female students were accepted in September 1969, when Stuyvesant offered admission to 14 girls and enrolled 12 of them. The next year, 223 female students were accepted to Stuyvesant. By 2015, young women represented 43% of the total student body.

In 1972, the New York State Legislature in the state capital of Albany passed the Hecht–Calandra Act, which designated four city-wide selective specialized public high schools in New York City of: Brooklyn Technical High School, Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School, and the High School of Music &amp; Art (now renamed Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant High. The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to the music and arts program at LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.

==== September 11 attacks (World Trade Center, 2001) ====
The current school building in Battery Park City of lower Manhattan since 1992, is about a half-mile / away from the site of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The school was evacuated during the attack. Although the smoke cloud from the World Trade Center temporarily covered the building, there was no structural damage, and there were no reports of physical injuries. Less than an hour after the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower, concern over a bomb threat at the school prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area, as reported live on the &quot;Today&quot; show. When classes resumed on September 21, 2001, students were moved to Brooklyn Technical High School while the Stuyvesant building served as a base of operations for rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech, and required the students to attend in two shifts, with the Stuyvesant students attending the evening shift. Normal classes resumed nearly a month after the attack, on October 9.
Nine alumni were killed in the World Trade Center attack. On October 2, 2001, the school newspaper, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, added a 24-page section with student photos, reflections and stories. On November 20, 2001, the magazine was distributed for free to the greater metropolitan area, enclosed within 830,000 copies of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In the months after the attacks, Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that the students take accounts of staff and students&#x27; reactions during and after September 11, 2001, and complile them into a collection of monologues. Thoms then published these monologues as &quot;With Their Eyes: September 11—The View from a High School at Ground Zero&quot;.

==== Later history ====
During the 2003–2004 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a procession from the 15th Street building to the Chambers Street one, a meeting of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology, an all-class reunion, and visits and speeches from notable alumni.

In the 21st century, keynote graduation speakers have included Attorney General Eric Holder (2001), United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan (2004), comedian Conan O&#x27;Brien (2006), actor George Takei (2016), and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (2018).
==Buildings==
===15th Street building===

In August 1904, the Board of Education authorized municipal architect and engineer Snyder to design a new facility for Stuyvesant High School at 15th Street. The new high school structure was designed in the then popular Beaux-Arts and Neoclassical / Classical Revival architecture for its grand imposing style. It would be shaped like the letter &quot;H&quot;, with two interior light courts; the shape also allowed natural light to illuminate more inside windows and parts of the building. The cornerstone for the new building was laid in September 1905. Approximately $1.5 million was spent on constructing the school, including $600,000 for the monumental stone exterior alone. It was considered one of the most expensive public buildings or school structures ever built up to that time in New York, and considered a point of civic pride in the early 20th century. In 1907, the Stuyvesant High School moved to the new building on 15th Street. The new building had a capacity of 2,600 students, more than double that of the existing previous temporary school building of the last few years at 23rd Street. It contained 25 classrooms devoted to skilled industrial trades such as joinery, as well as 53 regular classrooms and a 1,600-seat auditorium.

A half-century later, uring the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries, and cafeterias.

Unfortunately through the 1970s and 1980s, when New York City municipal government and especially the public schools system, in general, were marked by violence, vandalism / graffiti and low academic grades among their students, Stuyvesant High still had an excellent academic reputation for being a top-notch public high school, and was still graduating well-prepared and accomplished alumni, (judging from their track record now four decades later). However, the 1905–1907 school building was deteriorating due to overuse and lack of proper maintenance. A &quot;New York Times&quot; daily newspaper expose report stated that the building had &quot;held out into old age with minimal maintenance and benign neglect until its peeling paint, creaking floorboards and antiquated laboratories became an embarrassment.&quot; The five-story building could not cater adequately to the several thousand students, leading the New York City Board of Education to make plans to move the school to a new building in Battery Park City, near lower Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District. The 15th Street building remains in use over 32 years later as the &quot;Old Stuyvesant Campus,&quot; housing three smaller schools: the Institute for Collaborative Education, the High School for Health Professions and Human Services, and lower grades of PS 226.

===Current building===
In the 83rd year of its history of 1987, the 105th Mayor of New York City, Ed Koch (1924–2013, served 1978–1989), and 52nd Governor of New York State Mario Cuomo (1932–2015, served 1983–1994), jointly announced the coming construction project of a third new Stuyvesant High School building to be situated in Battery Park City of lower Manhattan. The Battery Park City Authority donated of land for the new building. The authority was not required to hire the lowest bidder, which meant that the construction process could be accelerated in return for a higher cost. The building was designed by the architectural firms of Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners. The structure&#x27;s main architect, Alexander Cooper of Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners, had also designed much of the surrounding development of Battery Park City.

Stuyvesant&#x27;s principal at the time, Abraham Baumel, visited the country&#x27;s most advanced laboratories to gather ideas about what to include in the new Stuyvesant building&#x27;s 12 laboratory rooms. The new 10-story building also included banks of escalators, glass-walled studios on the roof, and a shorter four-story northern wing with a swimming pool, five gymnasiums, and an auditorium. Construction began in 1989. When it finally opened five years later in 1992, the building was New York City&#x27;s first new high school building in ten years. The new downtown Stuyvesant Campus cost $150 million, making it the most expensive high school building ever built in the city at the time. The S.H.S. Library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.

Shortly after the third S.H.S. building was completed, the $10 million Tribeca Bridge was built to allow students to enter the building without having to cross the busy West Street. The building was designed to be fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (A.D.A.) and is listed as such by the New York City Department of Education. As a result, the building is one of the 5 additional sites of P721M, a school for students with multiple disabilities who are between the ages of 15 and 21.

In 1997, the eastern end of the mathematics floor was dedicated to Richard Rothenberg, the S.H.S. mathematics department chairman who had died from a sudden heart attack earlier that year. Sculptor Madeleine Segall-Marx was commissioned to create the Rothenberg Memorial in his honor. She created a mathematics wall entitled &quot;Celebration&quot;, consisting of 50 wooden boxes—one for each year of his life—behind a glass wall, featuring mathematical concepts and reflections on Rothenberg.

In 2006, Robert Ira Lewy of the class of 1960 made a gift worth $1 million to found the Dr. Robert Ira Lewy M.D. Multimedia Center. and donated his personal library in 2007. In late 2010, the high school&#x27;s library merged with the New York Public Library (NYPL) network in a four-year pilot program, in which all students of the school received a S.H.S. / N.Y.P.L. student library card so they could check books out of the school library or any other public library in the NYPL system.

An unfortunate escalator collapse at Stuyvesant High School on September 13, 2018, 26 years after it was built / installed, injured 10 people, including 8 students. As a result, various escalators remained closed off to students for examination / study and renovation for the next few years.

====&quot;Mnemonics&quot;====
During construction, the Battery Park City Authority, the Percent for Art Program of the City of New York, the Department of Cultural Affairs, and the New York City Board of Education commissioned &quot;Mnemonics&quot;, an artwork by public artists Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel. Four hundred hollow glass blocks were dispersed randomly from the basement to the tenth floor of the new Stuyvesant High School building. Each block contains relics providing evidence of geographical, historical, natural, cultural, and social worlds, from antiquity to the present time. The blocks are set into the hallway walls and scattered throughout the building. Each block is inscribed with a brief description of its contents or context. The items displayed include pieces of the 15th Street Stuyvesant building, fragments of monuments from around the world, memorabilia from each of the 88 years&#x27; history of the old building, a Revolutionary War button, water from the Nile and Ganges Rivers, fragments of the Mayan pyramids, and various chemical compounds. Empty blocks were also installed to be filled with items chosen by each of the graduating classes up through 2080. The S.H.S. installation later received the Award for Excellence in Design from the Art Commission of the City of New York.

==Transportation==

As of 2024, students are provided with OMNY cards that offer four free rides throughout the day, as well as public transportation access over the weekend.
==Enrollment==
===Entrance examination===
Stuyvesant has a total enrollment of over 3,000 students and is open to residents of New York City entering ninth or tenth grade. Enrollment is based solely on performance on the three-hour Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, which is administered annually. Approximately 28,000 students took the test in 2017. The list of schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include eight of New York&#x27;s nine specialized high schools. The test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant has consistently been higher than that needed for admission to the other schools using the test. Admission is currently based on an individual&#x27;s score on the examination and the pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant among the other specialized schools. Ninth- and rising tenth–grade students are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, but far fewer students are admitted that way. The test covers math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension) skills. Former Mayor John Lindsay and community activist group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) have argued that the exam may be biased against African and Hispanic Americans, while attempts to eliminate the exam have been criticized as discriminatory against Asian Americans.
===Demographics and SHSAT controversy===
For most of the 20th century, the student body at Stuyvesant High was not only all-male (1904–1969), but also heavily Jewish. A significant influx of Asian students began in the 1970s; by 2019, 74% of the Stuyvesant students in attendance were Asian-American. In the 2013 academic year, the student body was 72.43% Asian, 21.44% Caucasian, 1.03% African American, 2.34% Hispanic, and 3% unknown/other. The paucity of Black and Hispanic students at Stuyvesant High has often been an issue for some city administrators. In 1971, then 103rd New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921–2000, served 1966–1973), argued that the test was culturally biased against black and Hispanic students and sought to implement an affirmative action program. However, protests by parents forced the plan to be scrapped and led to the passage of the Hecht-Calandra Act, in the New York State Legislature which preserved admissions by examination only. A small number of students judged to be economically disadvantaged and who came within a few points of the cut-off score were given an extra chance to pass the test.

Community activist group ACORN International published two reports in 1996, titled &quot;Secret Apartheid&quot; and &quot;Secret Apartheid II&quot;. In these reports, ACORN called the SHSAT &quot;permanently suspect&quot; and described it as a &quot;product of an institutional racism,&quot; saying that black and Hispanic students did not have access to proper test preparation materials. Along with then New York Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew (born 1950, N.Y.C. public schools chancellor, 1995–1999), they began an initiative for more diversity in the city&#x27;s gifted and specialized schools, in particular demanding the SHSAT be suspended altogether until the city&#x27;s Board of Education was able to show all children have had access to appropriate materials to prepare themselves. Students published several editorials in response to ACORN&#x27;s claims, stating the admissions system at the school was based on student merit, not race.

A number of students take preparatory courses offered by private tutorial companies such as The Princeton Review and Kaplan, Inc. to perform better on the SHSAT, often leaving those unable to afford such classes at a disadvantage. To bridge this gap and boost minority admissions, the Board of Education started the Math Science Institute in 1995, a free program to prepare students for the admissions test. Students attend preparatory classes through the program, now known as the Specialized High School Institute (also known as DREAM), at several schools around the city from the summer after sixth grade until the eighth-grade exam. Despite the implementation of these free programs for improving underprivileged children&#x27;s enrollment, black and Hispanic enrollment continued to decline. After further expansion of those free test prep programs, there was still no increase in percentages to the attendance of black and Hispanic children. , fewer than 1% of freshman openings were given to black students, while over 66% were given to Asian-American students, most of whom had similar socioeconomic backgrounds to those of the black students.

The New York City Department of Education reported in 2003 that public per student spending at Stuyvesant High School is slightly lower than the city average. Stuyvesant also receives private contributions from alumni, retired faculty, charitable foundations and educational grants to build up a school endowment.

==Academics==
The college-preparatory curriculum at Stuyvesant mostly includes four years of English, history, and laboratory-based sciences. The sciences courses include requisite biology, chemistry, and physics classes. Students also take four years of mathematics. Students also take three years of a single foreign language; a semester each of introductory art, music, health, and technical drawing; one semester of computer science; and two lab-based technology courses. Several exemptions from technology education exist for seniors. Stuyvesant offers students a selection of elective courses, uncluding astronomy, New York City history, Women&#x27;s Voices, and Computer Graphics Design in the Computer Science Area. Most students complete the New York City Regents courses by junior year and take calculus during their senior year. However, the school offers math courses through differential equations for the more advanced students. A year of technical drawing was formerly required; students learned how to draft by hand in its first semester and how to draft using a computer in the second. Now, students take a one-semester compacted version of the former drafting course, as well as a semester of introductory computer science. For the class of 2015, the one-semester computer science course was replaced with a two-semester course.
As a specialized high school, Stuyvesant offers a range of Advanced Placement (AP) courses. These courses focus on math, science, history, English, or foreign languages. This gives students various opportunities to earn college credit. AP computer science students can also take three additional computer programming courses after the completion of the AP course: systems level programming, computer graphics, and software development. In addition, there is a one-year computer networking class which can earn students Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification.

Stuyvesant&#x27;s foreign language offerings include Spanish, French, German, Latin, Chinese and Japanese. In 2005, the school also started offering courses in Arabic after the school&#x27;s Muslim Student Association had raised funds to support the course. Stuyvesant&#x27;s biology and geo-science department offers courses in molecular biology, human physiology, medical ethics, medical and veterinary diagnosis, human disease, anthropology and sociobiology, vertebrate zoology, laboratory techniques, medical human genetics, botany, the molecular basis of cancer, nutrition science, and psychology. The chemistry and physics departments include classes in organic chemistry, physical chemistry, astronomy, engineering mechanics, and electronics.

The English Department offers students courses in British and classical literature, Shakespearean literature, science fiction, philosophy, existentialism, debate, acting, journalism, creative writing, and poetry. The Social Studies core requires two years of global history (or one year of global followed by one year of European history), one year of American history, as well as a semester each of economics and government. Humanities electives include American foreign policy; civil and criminal law, prejudice and persecution, and race, ethnicity and gender issues.

In 2004, Stuyvesant High entered into an agreement with the City College of New York (C.C.N.Y. – part of the larger City University of New York), which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by S.H.S. faculty. Some of these courses include linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women&#x27;s history.

Prior to the 2005 revision of the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test), Stuyvesant graduates had an average score of 1408 out of 1600 (685 in the verbal section of the test, 723 in the math section). In 2010, the average score on the SAT for Stuyvesant students was 2087 out of 2400, while the class of 2013 had an average SAT score of 2096. , Stuyvesant students&#x27; average SAT score was 1510 of 1600 points. Stuyvesant also administers more Advanced Placement exams than supposedly any other high school in the world, as well as the highest number of students who reach the AP courses&#x27; &quot;mastery level&quot;. , there are 31 AP classes offered, with a little more than half of all students taking at least one AP class, and about 98% of students pass their AP tests.

==Extracurricular activities==
===Sports===
Stuyvesant fields 32 athletics varsity teams, including the swimming, golf, bowling, volleyball, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, fencing, baseball/softball, American handball, tennis, track/cross country, cricket, football, and lacrosse teams. In addition, Stuyvesant has ultimate teams for the boys&#x27; varsity, boys&#x27; junior varsity, and girls&#x27; varsity divisions.

15 years after moving to Chambers Street in Battery Park City, in September 2007, the Stuyvesant High football team was given a home field at Pier 40, on the Hudson River waterfront of the westside of Manhattan situated north of the school at Houston Street and West Street. In 2008, the baseball team was granted use of the pier after construction and delivery of an artificial turf pitching mound that met Public Schools Athletic League specifications. Stuyvesant also has its own swimming pool, but it does not contain its own running track or tennis court.

===Student government===
The student body of Stuyvesant High School is represented by the Stuyvesant Student Union, a student government. It comprises a group of students (elected each year for each grade) who promote and manage extracurricular activities (clubs and publications), by organizing out-of-school activity such as city excursions or fundraisers, and provide a voice to the student body in all discussion of school policy with the administration.

===Clubs and publications===
Stuyvesant allows students to join clubs, publications, and teams under a system similar to that of many colleges. , the school had 150 student clubs.

====&quot;The Spectator&quot;====

&quot;The Spectator&quot; is Stuyvesant&#x27;s official in-school newspaper, which is published biweekly and is independent from the school administration and faculty. There are over 250 students who help with its publication. At the beginning of the fall and spring terms, there are recruitments, but interested students may join at any time.

Founded in 1915 (and now 109 years old), &quot;The Spectator&quot; is one of Stuyvesant&#x27;s oldest publications. It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake; the Columbia University&#x27;s &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;, and has been recognized by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism&#x27;s well-known nation-wide Columbia Scholastic Press Association. founded 1925.

====&quot;The Voice&quot;====

&quot;The Voice&quot; was founded in the 1973–1974 academic year as an independent publication only loosely sanctioned by school officials. It had the appearance of a magazine and gained a large readership. &quot;The Voice&quot; attracted a considerable amount of controversy and a First Amendment Constitutional lawsuit, after which the administration forced it to go off-campus and to turn commercial in 1975–1976.

At the beginning of the 1975–1976 academic year, &quot;The Voice&quot; decided to publish the results of a confidential random survey. The administration refused to permit &quot;The Voice&quot; to distribute the questionnaire, and the Board of Education refused to intervene. The then editor-in-chief of &quot;The Voice&quot;, brought a First Amendment challenge to this decision to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in front of Judge Constance Baker Motley.

Relying on the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court holding in &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; that &quot;undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression&quot;, Motley ordered the New York City Board of Education to permit the distribution of the survey to the juniors and seniors. However, Judge Motley&#x27;s ruling was overturned on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. There Judge J. Edward Lumbard, joined by Judge Murray Gurfein and over dissent by third Judge Walter R. Mansfield, held that the distribution of the questionnaires was properly disallowed by the administration. The higher level U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari review.

===SING!===
The annual theater competition known as SING! pits seniors, juniors, and &quot;soph-frosh&quot; (freshmen and sophomores working together) against each other in a contest to put on the best performance. SING! started in 1947 at Midwood High School in Brooklyn and has expanded to many New York City high schools since then. SING! at Stuyvesant started as a small event in 1973, and since then, has grown to a school-wide event; in 2005, nearly 1,000 students participated. The entire production is written, directed, produced, and funded by students. Their involvement ranges from being members of the production&#x27;s casts, choruses, or costume and tech crews to Step, Hip-Hop, Swing, Modern, Bolly, Flow, Tap or Latin dance groups. SING! begins in late January to February and ends in final performances on three nights in March/April. Scoring is done on each night&#x27;s performances and the winner is determined by the overall total. In 2023, soph-frosh won SING! for the first time in the tradition&#x27;s fifty-one year history.

==Reputation==
The Stuyvesant High School has produced many notable alumni, including four Nobel laureates. As of 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine&quot; ranked Stuyvesant as 2nd among New York City high schools and 21st among STEM high schools. In December 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; studied the freshman classes at eight selective colleges in the U.S. and reported that Stuyvesant sent 67 students to these schools, comprising 9.9% of its 674 seniors. In recent years, Stuyvesant High’s student newspaper has reported on college admissions of the graduating classes, with the class of 2021 having 133 students offered admission to Ivy League institutions.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; included Stuyvesant on its list of &quot;Best High Schools&quot; published in December 2009, ranking 31st. In its 2010 progress report, the New York City Department of Education assigned S.H.S. an &quot;A&quot;, the highest possible grade.

Stuyvesant has had the second highest number of National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists, behind Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. From 2002 to 2010, Stuyvesant has produced 103 semi-finalists and 13 finalists on the Intel Science Talent Search, the second most of any secondary school in the United States behind the Bronx High School of Science. In 2014, Stuyvesant had 11 semi-finalists for the Intel Search, the highest number of any school in the U.S.

In the 2010s, exam schools, including Stuyvesant, have been the subject of studies questioning their academic effectiveness. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts) and Duke University (Durham, North Carolina) economists compared high school outcomes for Stuyvesant students who barely passed the SHSAT score required for admission, to those of applicants just below that score, using the latter as a natural control group of peers who attended other schools. The study found no discernible average difference in the two groups&#x27; later performance on New York state exams.

==Notable people==
Notable scientists among Stuyvesant alumni include mathematicians Bertram Kostant (1945) and 
Paul Cohen (1950), string theorist Brian Greene (1980), physicist Lisa Randall (1980), and genomic researcher Eric Lander (1974). Other prominent alumni include civil rights leader Bob Moses, &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; editor Nick Meglin (1953), entertainers such as songwriter and Steely Dan founder Walter Becker, Thelonious Monk (1935), and actors Lucy Liu (1968), Tim Robbins (1976), and James Cagney (1918), comedian Paul Reiser (1973), playwright Arthur M. Jolly (1987), sports anchor Mike Greenberg (1985), and Columbia University, early NBA and minor league pro basketball player and bookmaker Jack Molinas (1949). In business, government and politics, former United States Attorney General Eric Holder in the Obama presidential administration (1969) is a Stuyvesant alumnus, as are 2008 presidential election campaign manager and later presidential administration Senior Advisor to President Barack Obama David Axelrod (1972) and former adviser to earlier President Bill Clinton, of Dick Morris (1964).

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt was an S.H.S. faculty member and taught English at Stuyvesant before the publication of his memoirs &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Tis&quot;, and &quot;Teacher Man&quot;. &quot;Teacher Man&quot; third section, titled &quot;Coming Alive in Room 205&quot;, concerns McCourt&#x27;s time at Stuyvesant, and mentions a number of students and fellow faculty. Former New York City Council member Eva Moskowitz (1982) graduated from the high school, as did the creator of the BitTorrent protocol, Bram Cohen (1993). A notable Olympic Games medalist from the school was foil fencer Albert Axelrod, and a notable coach was two-time fencing Olympian Herb Cohen. Economist Thomas Sowell was also a student of Stuyvesant High School, but dropped out early at age 17 because of financial difficulties and problems in his home. Russian (and former Soviet Union) journalist / propagandist Vladimir Pozner Jr., known in the West for his numerous appearances during the 1980s and 1990s on the ABC News late-evening program &quot;Nightline&quot;, with Ted Koppel, on the topic: U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge and influential longtime daytime talk show host / moderator Phil Donahue, was also a student of Stuyvesant High School.

Four Nobel laureates are Stuyvesant alumni (plus one who shares a Nobel Prize with a coalition):
* Joshua Lederberg (1941) – Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1958
* Robert Fogel (1944) – Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 1993

<text>The Mennonite World Conference (MWC) is an international Mennonite Anabaptist Christian denomination. Its headquarters are in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
The first &quot;Mennonite World Conference&quot; was held in Basel in 1925. Its main purpose was to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Anabaptism. An assembly is convened approximately every six or seven years.

Christian Neff (1863–1946), a Mennonite minister in Germany, is often called the &quot;father&quot; of the Mennonite World Conference. Neff, through the Conference of Mennonites in South Germany, issued the call for the first gathering in 1925, and was president of the following meetings in 1930 and 1936.

The MWC prints a quarterly news publication in three languages—Spanish (as &#x27;), English (&quot;Courier&quot;), and French (&#x27;.) This project began in 1986. The &quot;Mennonite World Conference&quot; considers that its mission is to (1) be a global community of faith in the Anabaptist-tradition, (2) facilitate relationships between Anabaptist-related churches worldwide, and (3) relate to other Christian world communions and organizations.

The official repository of Mennonite World Conference is the Mennonite Church USA Archives.

According to a census published by the association in 2022, it would have 107 member denominations in 59 countries, and 1,47 million baptized members in 10,300 churches. 

== Beliefs ==
The Conference has an Anabaptist confession of faith.

== Affiliated organizations ==
=== GMF ===
The Global Mission Fellowship (GMF) has 71 mission member organizations. 

=== GASN ===
The Global Anabaptist Service Network (GASN) supports humanitarian aid projects.

<doc id="418067" wikidata="Q3071977" url="?curid=418067" title="Job's Daughters International">
<text>Job&#x27;s Daughters International is a Masonic affiliated youth organization for girls and young women aged 10 to 20. The organization is commonly referred to as simply Job&#x27;s Daughters, and sometimes abbreviated as JDI (or IOJD, referring to its longtime former name, International Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters). Job&#x27;s Daughters welcomes many religions and cultures.

The only religious prerequisite is a belief in a Supreme being.

Family relationship to a Free and Accepted Mason is no longer a prerequisite for membership. Masons are active with the organization and participate in most states as &quot;Associate Guardians&quot; on the respective levels.

JDI promotes itself as an organization &quot;where girls rule,&quot; but there is plenty of adult guidance and interaction. Members are referred to as Jobies, and members make long-lasting friendships across the world to promote the ideals of the order.

== Membership ==
In order to apply for membership in Job&#x27;s Daughters, one must be a girl between the ages of 10 and 20. To join this organization, an applicant may be either related to a Master Mason or be sponsored by a Majority Member of Job&#x27;s Daughters and a Master Mason.

Members are not required to practice any particular religion, but they must believe in a Supreme Being.

Members of Job&#x27;s Daughters are also not restricted to join or be leaders in other Masonic youth bodies, such as Rainbow for Girls and can serve as any of the female youth leaders in DeMolay being able to serve as a Sweetheart, Princess, Duchess, and Chapter Little Sis. At age 18, they also are eligible to join the Order of Eastern Star, The Daughters of the Nile, the Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem, and other appendant bodies.

If a daughter reaches the age of 20 or marries, and is in good standing in the Bethel (an individual chapter), she is considered a majority member. Majority members are encouraged to remain active in the order as adult leaders otherwise known as CAVs or Certified Adult Volunteers, who have to go through a training session to be able to supervise other members other than their own family.

== History ==
The organization was founded as The Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters by Ethel T. Wead Mick in Omaha, Nebraska, on October 20, 1920.
 The purpose of the organization is to band together young women and strives to build character through moral and spiritual development. Goals include a greater reverence for God and the Holy Scriptures, as stated in the Job&#x27;s Daughters Constitution, loyalty to one&#x27;s country and that country&#x27;s flag; and respect for parents, guardians, and elderly as well as each other.

Ethel T. Wead Mick, fittingly called &quot;Mother Mick&quot; was fond of the Book of Job, and took the name of the organization as a reference to the three daughters of Job. Which was often read to her as a child by her mother. The Book of Job, 42nd chapter, 15th verse says, &quot;In all the land were no women found so fair as the Daughters of Job, and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren&quot;. This has special meaning for members of Job&#x27;s Daughters, the first part representing the members of the order, and the second part, &quot;and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren,&quot; standing for the masonic heritage that members have, which was originally a requirement for membership in Job&#x27;s Daughters. Ethel founded the Order with the assistance of her husband, Dr. William H. Mick, and several Freemasons and members of Eastern Star of Nebraska. She dedicated the organization to the memory of her mother, Elizabeth D. Wead.

By June 1923 the Job&#x27;s Daughters had been endorsed by the Grand Chapters of the Order of the Eastern Star in Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington, DC. The order spread rapidly in the early 1920s. At the third annual meeting of the &quot;Supreme Guardian Council&quot; in Chicago on Oct. 12, 1923, delegates were present from twenty-three states, the Territory of Alaska and Manitoba.

In 1931 the name was changed to the International Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters after a Bethel was instituted in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Later, the name was changed from the International Order of Job&#x27;s Daughters to Job&#x27;s Daughters International.

The ritual of the Order was drawn up by Le Roy T. Wilcox, a scholar of Masonic law, and the group came &quot;under the general management of the Masonic order&quot;. It was originally adopted in 1921. The ritual- a small purple book used by members has been revised a total number of 7 times, in 1934, 1944, 1954, 1964, 1974, 1989, and lastly in 2011. With the ritual being recopyrighted in 2012.

== Levels of Jurisdiction ==
* The individual chapter is called a Bethel (as is the meeting location), and each is numbered sequentially according to when they were instituted in their jurisdiction. They usually meet at a Masonic Lodge building, but may meet at a church hall, or other fraternal hall. A Bethel is similar to a troop in Girl or Boy Scouts.
* The next highest level is the Grand level. This comprises all the Bethels in their respective states (or country in the cases of the Philippines.) This level has an annual convention located somewhere in that jurisdiction and can last a few days each time. These conventions usually encompass the Grand Bethel Meetings and/or Installation, and the Installation of the Grand Guardian Council. Jurisdictions that do not have a Grand level and are directly under Supreme law often host similar events as substitutions. 
* The highest level in the Order is the Supreme level. This is similar to the Grand level, except on an international scale.

Each level above the local Bethel has a different philanthropic project. The Supreme project is the H.I.K.E Fund, or Hearing Improvement Kids Endowment Foundation. The Grand jurisdiction varies by area, and typically changes every year.

Today, Bethels and Grand Bethels are active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Philippines and the United States. Within the United States, there are currently Bethels in 28 states. Most states and provinces have a Grand Guardian Council but some are under the direct supervision of the Supreme Guardian Council.

==Official Regalia==
Members of JDI are recognizable by their dress, which is white Grecian robes which would have been worn during the time of Job, purposed to stress the ideals of equality; symbolic of equal importance in life. Creating a space for everyone, regardless of background, family or identity outside of the bethel. The color white also significant to the Regalia, representing purity and joy.
The Three Principal officers of the bethel, who hold the stations of Honored Queen, Senior Princess and Junior Princess wear extra regalia, such as capes and crowns. The cape for the Honored Queen is the longest, being floor length, while the other two are shorter, landing about the hips. Capes are purple, to represent true royalty, both in blood and in character. They often have a white Grecian grid-lock pattern along the trim, and are secured the same way standard robes are. The Principal officers also wear crowns, with minor differences between them for each of the offices.

The Junior Princess&#x27; Crown has a white jewel in the center to represent hope, purity, and truth. In the most modern versions of the crown, there are doves on it to represent her as well, a reminder to seek strength from above. It mirrors the name of the first daughter of Job as well, known as Jemima, meaning &quot;Dove.&quot;

The Senior Princess&#x27; Crown has a purple jewel in the center to represent royalty. In the most modern versions of the crown there are Urns of Incense, to represent prayer. It mirrors the name of Job&#x27;s second daughter, named Keziah, meaning &quot;used in incense,&quot; or &quot;prayer.&quot;

The Honored Queen&#x27;s Crown is similar to the Senior Princess&#x27; with its center purple jewel. The notable difference is the modern version, where the crown has two Cornucopia, or Horns of Plenty, on the crown in the same placement as the urn or dove for the princesses. It has the same connection to the daughters of Job as the others, representing Keren Happuch the third daughter of job, whose name means &quot;plenty,&quot; or &quot;abundance.&quot;

==Famous Job&#x27;s Daughters==
Notable former Job&#x27;s Daughters include Kim Cattrall, Jacquelynne Fontaine, Nancy Fleming, Jenilee Harrison, Nannette Hegerty, Vicki Lawrence, Heather Moore, Jean Rabe, Debbie Reynolds, and Aimee Teegarden.

==H.I.K.E.==
Members of Job&#x27;s Daughters participate in raising funds for the philanthropic project of the Order, known as H.I.K.E. H.I.K.E. stands for Hearing Improved Kids Endowment (Fund). It was founded by Emma Tedrick and Charles Terrel to help children be able to access hearing devices. It is staffed by unpaid volunteers in the US and Canada. The organization estimates around 100 children are provided with hearing devices each year with H.I.K.E.

Jobs Daughters often honor this organization by using sign language in their ceremonies, songs and closing formations at the close of meetings. Most notably signing and singing the first and fifth lyric of &quot;Nearer, My God to Thee,&quot; in the Christian Cross formation. The Honored Queen, Senior Princess and Junior Princess sign the words in most cases. Other songs have been adapted into sign, but it varies for each state and jurisdiction.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Sander (25 August 1885 in Glatz (Kłodzko) – 15 September 1938) was a German pyrotechnics and rocket technology engineer as well as manufacturer remembered for his contributions to rocket-powered flight as key protagonist of the Opel-RAK program.

Sander was the son of a professional soldier. He went to school in Uslar on the southwestern edge of the Solling and then learned to be a mechanical engineer. At the Technikum Strelitz in Altstrelitz in Mecklenburg he became an engineer around 1908/09. In 1909 Sander moved to Bremerhaven. Here he worked in various areas. In 1920 he took over the company of master gunsmith H. G. Cordes in Bremerhaven, who had existed from 1853 and was known as the inventor of the whaling cannon. Sander soon expanded the factory&#x27;s products to include signal rockets.

From 1925, the Sander line-throwing rocket pistols designed by him for the rescue of shipwrecked people belonged to the equipment of the rescue stations and boats of the German Society for the Rescue of Shipwrecked People and many similar organizations around the world. In 1925, Sander bought the Schultz ship telegraph factory in Bremerhaven, which gave him a larger, two-story factory building at Fährstrasse No. 26 as a prerequisite for accepting development contracts offered by the Navy.

In 1928, he was approached by Max Valier, on behalf of Fritz von Opel to provide rockets to propel cars and aircraft as a means of popularizing the use of rockets for propulsion and for promoting the Opel company. Their joint projects within Opel-RAK, the world&#x27;s first large-scale rocket program, involved the creation of the world&#x27;s first rocket car, the Opel RAK.1 and the first rocket glider, the Ente, and the world&#x27;s first purpose-built rocket plane Opel RAK.1.

He was married to Cäcilie Sander and had three boys: Hans HW (1918-1998), Bruno (1918-1983) and Herbert (1920-?).

== Opel RAK rocket program ==

Fritz von Opel and Sander were instrumental in popularizing rockets as means of propulsion for vehicles. In the 1920s, they initiated together with Max Valier, co-founder of the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot;, the world&#x27;s first rocket program, Opel-RAK, leading to speed records for automobiles, rail vehicles and the first public manned rocket-powered flight in September 1929. Months earlier in 1928, one of his rocket-powered prototypes, the Opel RAK2, reached piloted by von Opel himself at the AVUS speedway in Berlin a record speed of 238 km/h, watched by 3000 spectators and world media, among them Fritz Lang, director of &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;, world boxing champion Max Schmeling and many more sports and show business celebrities. A world record for rail vehicles was reached with RAK3 and a top speed of 256 km/h. After these successes, von Opel piloted the world&#x27;s first public rocket-powered flight using Opel RAK.1, a rocket plane designed by Julius Hatry.
Timeline

* On 15 March 1928, Opel tested his first rocket-powered car, the Opel RAK.1, and achieved a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph) in it, proving the feasibility of the concept of rocket propulsion. Less than two months later, he reached a speed of 230 km/h (143 mph) in the RAK.2, driven by 24 solid-fuel rockets.

* Later that same year, he purchased a sailplane named the &quot;Lippisch Ente&quot; (&quot;Ente&quot; is &quot;duck&quot; in German) from Alexander Lippisch and attached rocket motors to it, creating the world&#x27;s first rocket plane on 11 June. The aircraft exploded on its second test flight, before Opel had had a chance to pilot it himself, so he commissioned a new aircraft, also called the RAK.1, from Julius Hatry, and flew it at Frankfurt-am-Main on 30 September 1929. In the meantime, another mishap had claimed the RAK.3, a rocket-powered railway car powered by 30 solid-fuel rockets which had reached a speed of 254 km/h (157 mph). 
* Also in 1928, Opel built and test ran a rocket-powered motorcycle called the Monster.

== Liquid-fuel rocket development, test launches and a planned flight across the English channel ==
According to Frank H. Winter, curator at National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, the Opel group was also working on liquid-fuel rockets (SPACEFLIGHT, Vol. 21,2, Feb. 1979): In a cabled exclusive to The New York Times on 30 September 1929, von Opel is quoted as saying: &quot;Sander and I now want to transfer the liquid rocket from the laboratory to practical use. With the liquid rocket I hope to be the first man to thus fly across the English Channel. I will not rest until I have accomplished that.&quot; At a speech on the donation of a RAK 2 replica to the Deutsches Museum, von Opel mentioned also Opel engineer Josef Schaberger as a key collaborator. &quot;He belonged,&quot; von Opel said, &quot;with the same enthusiasm as Sander to our small secret group, one of the tasks of which was to hide all the preparations from my father, because his paternal apprehensions led him to believe that I was cut out for something better than being a rocket researchist. Schaberger supervised all the details involved in construction and assembly (of rocket cars), and every time I sat behind the wheel with a few hundred pounds of explosives in my rear, and made the first contact, I did so with a feeling of total security [...] As early as 1928, Mr. Schaberger and I developed a liquid rocket, which was definitely the first permanently operating rocket in which the explosive was injected into the combustion chamber and simultaneously cooled using pumps. [...] We used benzol as the fuel,&quot; von Opel continued, &quot;and nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer. This rocket was installed in a Mueller-Griessheim aircraft and developed a thrust of 70 kg (154 lb.).&quot; By May 1929, the engine produced a thrust of 200 kg (440 lb.) &quot;for longer than fifteen minutes and in July 1929, the Opel RAK collaborators were able to attain powered phases of more than thirty minutes for thrusts of 300 kg (660-lb.) at Opel&#x27;s works in Rüsselsheim,&quot; according to Max Valier&#x27;s account.
Max Valier also reports the launch of two experimental liquid-fuel rockets by Sander on 10 and 12 April 1929. In his book “Raketenfahrt” he describes the size of the rockets as of 21 cm in diameter and with a length of 74 cm, weighing 7 kg empty and 16 kg with fuel. The maximum thrust was 45 to 50 kp, with a total burning time of 132 seconds. These properties indicate a gas pressure pumping. The first missile rose so quickly that Sander lost sight of it. Two days later, a second unit was ready to go, Sander tied a 4,000-meter-long rope to the rocket. After 2000 m of rope had been unwound, the line broke and this rocket also disappeared in the area, probably near the Opel proving ground and racetrack in Rüsselsheim, the &quot;Rennbahn&quot;. The main purpose of these tests was to develop the propulsion system for the aircraft for crossing the English channel. Therefore, the flights of these two (compared to the airplane) small rockets were not published. The combustion tests with the aircraft rocket engine proceeded very successful. Unfortunately the plane was destroyed during a nightly transport on a truck on the Opel factory grounds, as the senior boss Wilhelm von Opel felt disturbed by the engine noise and wanted to stop this new “dangerous madness” of his son.

== Imprisonment in Third Reich period ==

From 1930, Sander (with other pyrotechnics factories) began secretly manufacturing rockets for military purposes, at the direction of Walter Dornberger. Without warning, Sander was arrested by the Gestapo on 31 January 1935. His company was subordinated to a trustee of the military, so it was expropriated and all documents were confiscated. After three months in custody, Sander was released, only to be arrested again in November 1935. After a year in custody, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison and a fine for treason. Sander had also sold his missiles to Italy and England. Since these were older versions of his powder rockets, he did not consider this to be forbidden. Sander speculated that the Army Weapons Office (&quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot;) wanted to develop and manufacture the missile weapons itself. His company was run as Donar GmbH für Apparatebau without him. He died in 1938.

<text>Timoci Uluivuda Bavadra (22 September 1934 – 3 November 1989) was a Fijian medical doctor who founded the Fiji Labour Party and served as the Prime Minister of Fiji for one month in 1987.

He was born in Viseisei, Viti Levu, and was a medical doctor and politician by profession.

Contesting his first election in 1987, Bavadra forged an electoral coalition between his Labour Party and the much older, Indo-Fijian-dominated National Federation Party. Although much larger, the NFP agreed to play a junior role in the coalition, aware that much of the ethnic Fijian community was not ready to accept an Indo-Fijian Prime Minister; even a government with a significant Indo-Fijian presence was itself bound to stretch the patience of ethnic Fijians.

The election was a stunning upset. The Labour-NFP coalition captured 28 seats, four more than the Alliance Party, thereby ending the twenty-year reign of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who, first as Chief Minister and subsequently as Prime Minister, had led Fiji since its pre-independence years. Although an ethnic Fijian, Bavadra had been elected mostly with the support of Indo-Fijians. Of the 28 members of his parliamentary caucus, only seven were ethnic Fijians, all of them elected from predominantly Indo-Fijian constituencies, a factor which caused considerable resentment among extremist sections of the Fijian population. Only nine percent of the ethnic Fijian electorate had voted for Bavadra&#x27;s coalition, but even this was an unprecedented feat – a point that was largely overlooked.

Bavadra was opposed to nuclear testing and had hinted that visits by nuclear-armed warships of the United States Navy might not be welcome. Allegations have been made that the United States either supported or allowed Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka to stage the coup on 13 May 1987 that brought down Bavadra&#x27;s government. Unable to reverse the coup, Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau formally dismissed Bavadra on 19 May. Bavadra made a tour of Commonwealth capitals, attempting to rally support, but got little more than sympathy. In London in June, Queen Elizabeth, on advice of the Fijian Governor-General, refused to meet him. After a period of negotiations, another coup, and a period of military rule, Ratu Mara again took office as Prime Minister on 5 December.

Bavadra died of cancer in 1989.

<doc id="418071" wikidata="Q3136216" url="?curid=418071" title="International Order of the Rainbow for Girls">
<text>The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls (IORG) is a Masonic youth service organization that teaches leadership training through community service. Young women learn about the value of charity and service through their work and involvement with their annual local and Grand (state or country) service projects. Historically, the order welcomed girls from age eleven to twenty years old with or without a family connection Freemasonry. The modern organization is open to all regardless of race or religion.

== History ==
The order came into existence in 1922, 
when the Reverend W. Mark Sexson, a Freemason, was asked to make an address before South McAlester Chapter #149, Order of the Eastern Star, in McAlester, Oklahoma. As the Order of DeMolay had come under his close study during his Masonic activities, he suggested that a similar order for young women would be beneficial. The first Initiation consisted of a class of 171 young women on April 6, 1922, in the auditorium of the Scottish Rite Temple in McAlester, Oklahoma. The original name was &quot;Order of the Rainbow for Girls&quot;.

== Officers ==
Members can hold many different offices (also called Stations) in the local Assembly. Each requires some memory work and all but two serve for one term (four or six months out of the year, depending on Assembly bylaws). Some offices are elected by the other members in the assembly. These offices normally include Faith, Hope, Charity, Worthy Associate Advisor, and Worthy Advisor. There are also two offices that are elected in January but serve a full year which are Treasurer and Recorder. The other offices are appointed by the Worthy Advisor (President) and Mother Advisor. All offices include:
* Worthy Advisor (WA) – presides at meetings and plans activities for her term like a president: the highest office in an assembly
* Worthy Associate Advisor (WAA) – duties similar to a vice president; presides over a meeting in the absence of the worthy advisor
* Charity teaches about charitable deeds
* Hope teaches that hope is always there for us
* Faith teaches that faith is our constant companion. She is the officer who guides new candidates throughout an initiation ceremony.
* Recorder records minutes and handles correspondence
* Treasurer handles money and bills and compiles reports about the balances of the assembly&#x27;s various money accounts
* Chaplain leads in prayers
* Drill Leader leads the officers in their floor work and leads guests around the assembly room
* Seven Bow Stations teach lessons about the colors of the rainbow and their corresponding virtues:
**Love (red) in all its forms
**Religion (orange) the importance of religion in all its forms (based on love and forgiveness)
**Nature (yellow) its importance in your daily life
**Immortality (green) the understanding of death is a part of life
**Fidelity (blue) emphasis on being honest and reliable
**Patriotism (indigo) encouraging citizenship to your country
**Service (violet) service to others which bind all the colors together
*Confidential Observer guards the inner doors of the assembly room
*Outer Observer guards the outer doors of the assembly room
* Musician and Choir Director provide music for the meetings

Some Assemblies and Grand Assemblies have other officers not specified in the ritual, such as Historian, Editor, Assistant Grand Editor, Circulation Manager, Orator (or Lecturer), Bible Bearer, Goodwill Ambassador, American Flag Bearer, State Flag Bearer, Christian Flag Bearer, Rainbow Flag Bearer, and Assembly Banner Bearer.

It is an unwritten rule that each of the line officers (Faith, Hope, Charity, and Worthy Associate Advisor) advances to the next highest office, culminating in her term as Worthy Advisor. However, this is not a guarantee.

== Advisors ==
The local assembly is governed by an advisory board of seven to fifteen adults consisting of master masons, members of Order of the Eastern Star, members of the Order of Amaranth, majority members, and family members of active members. Some advisory boards are appointed by a sponsoring body, while others are a &quot;club&quot; style and are not sponsored. Elected offices of an advisory board are Chairperson, Mother Advisor, Secretary, and Treasurer. The mother advisor is the liaison between the members and the advisory board. Almost all of the assembly work should be done by the members, with the advisors in support roles only. A district deputy is appointed by the supreme inspector/deputy as an aide to the local assemblies. The authority of the district deputy is limited to inspecting the ceremonial work of the assembly and providing guidance at the request of the advisory board or supreme inspector/deputy. The district deputy is not a member of the advisory board but is a resource and a reference as well as the first person the mother advisor and board chair would go to for help and questions.

==High honors==
The appointing of Grand Officers varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, to be appointed or elected to a Grand Floor Office, a member must be a past or present worthy advisor in her assembly. Grand representatives may also be PWAs, but it is not mandatory. Other offices include: Grand Choir, Grand Assistant Outer Observer/Grand Confidential Observer Helper, Personal Page, and Grand Page at Large. Each jurisdiction has their own traditions. 

The Grand Cross of Color is the highest award given to a member or adult leader for outstanding service. Recipients of the award (Masters of the Grand Cross of Color) are expected to meet once per year for a special service. In order for designates to be nominated, the assembly must initiate 3 new members within a calendar year. For every 3 new members, one member may be chosen to receive the Grand Cross of Color for service rendered above and beyond what is expected for Rainbow. The Masters of the Grand Cross of Color meet with the Advisory Board to decide which member(s) to nominate as a designee for the Grand Cross of Color. The Grand Cross of Color may also be awarded to adults that serve the assembly, but there may be no more adults than young women that are nominated. In addition, adult sponsors without Masonic affiliation are awarded the Service to Rainbow in place of the Grand Cross of Color. 

===Supreme Assembly ===
The governing body of Rainbow is the House of Gold. New members are elected by current members. The House of Gold consists of the Supreme Officers (paralleling a local Assembly), Supreme Inspectors (chief advisor for a jurisdiction), and several others making up a total of 50.

Presiding Supreme Inspectors may retire their duties at any time, unless they are elected to the Supreme line, at which time they must find a successor by the time they reach Supreme Worthy Associate Advisor. The current Supreme Inspector chooses the person whom they believe can best associate with the members of their jurisdiction. That person will become the next Supreme Deputy. It isn&#x27;t until Supreme Deputies are elected into the House of Gold that they become Supreme Inspectors. There are 50 seats in the House of Gold, and they are lifetime appointments. A Supreme Deputy is eligible for recommendation into the House of Gold after her 3rd Supreme Assembly after being installed as Supreme Deputy (the Supreme at which they are installed does NOT count).

== Locations ==

The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls has assemblies in 46 states in the United States as well as in several other countries. The states without assemblies are Delaware, Minnesota, Utah, and Wyoming.

The countries outside the United States that have assemblies are Aruba, Australia (in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia), Bolivia, Brazil (in Parana, São Paulo, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Tocantins, Pará, Espírito Santo and Santa Catarina [ Biguaçu ]), Canada (in Ontario and New Brunswick), Paraguay (in Asuncion, Encarnación, Ciudad del Este and Concepción), the Philippines, Italy, Mexico, and Romania. Rainbow has had assemblies in other countries, mostly due to American military presence: Cuba, Germany, France, Panama and Vietnam.

Its headquarters are at the International Temple in McAlester, Oklahoma built in 1950-1951 for the Order&#x27;s use.

== Membership ==
Being related to a Master Mason or member of Eastern Star no longer is a requirement for Rainbow membership. Interested young women must submit an application and associated fee to an Assembly. The members of that Assembly will meet with the young woman to answer any questions she or her parents/guardians may have and to make sure she is a proper candidate to receive the degrees. A proper candidate, by guidelines of the order is a girl within the appropriate age range who believes in the existence of a Supreme Being, does not cohabitate with a significant other, has had no children, is not pregnant, has never been married, and has the permission of her parents/guardians to become a member. Once the application is accepted, the assembly will vote on accepting the candidate into the Assembly. Membership then starts with an Initiation Ceremony.

Members are expected to serve their community, be law-abiding, acknowledge the authority of the Supreme Assembly, and show loyalty to the other members, among other things. In 2000, the rules for Eastern Star were changed so that majority members of Rainbow were eligible for membership in that Order. For girls between ages 6 and 10, some jurisdictions have a &quot;Pledge&quot; program for prospective members, so that they can become familiar with Rainbow ceremonies and activities.

Majority Membership is reached in two ways. A young woman receives age majority when she reaches her 20th birthday, or marriage majority if she marries before age 20. Also, depending on the jurisdiction, young women are given the choice of extending their membership until they reach the age of 21. For this to be granted, the young woman must write a letter expressing her interest in extending her active service and present it to her Supreme Deputy/Inspector.

<text>Elias Menachem Stein (January 13, 1931 – December 23, 2018) was an American mathematician who was a leading figure in the field of harmonic analysis. He was the Albert Baldwin Dod Professor of Mathematics, Emeritus, at Princeton University, where he was a faculty member from 1963 until his death in 2018.

==Biography==
Stein was born in Antwerp Belgium, to Elkan Stein and Chana Goldman, Ashkenazi Jews from Belgium. After the German invasion in 1940, the Stein family fled to the United States, first arriving in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1949, where he was classmates with future Fields Medalist Paul Cohen, before moving on to the University of Chicago for college. In 1955, Stein earned a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago under the direction of Antoni Zygmund. He began teaching at MIT in 1955, moved to the University of Chicago in 1958 as an assistant professor, and in 1963 became a full professor at Princeton.

Stein worked primarily in the field of harmonic analysis, and made contributions in both extending and clarifying Calderón–Zygmund theory. These include &quot;Stein interpolation&quot; (a variable-parameter version of complex interpolation), the &quot;Stein maximal principle&quot; (showing that under many circumstances, almost everywhere convergence is equivalent to the boundedness of
a maximal function), &quot;Stein complementary series representations&quot;, &quot;Nikishin–Pisier–Stein factorization&quot; in operator theory, the &quot;Tomas–Stein restriction theorem&quot; in Fourier analysis, the &quot;Kunze–Stein phenomenon&quot; in convolution on semisimple groups, the Cotlar–Stein lemma concerning the sum of almost orthogonal operators, and the Fefferman–Stein theory of the Hardy space formula_1 and the space formula_2 of functions of bounded mean oscillation.

He wrote numerous books on harmonic analysis (see e.g. [1,3,5]), which are often cited as the standard references on the subject. His &quot;Princeton Lectures in Analysis&quot; series [6,7,8,9] were penned for his sequence of undergraduate courses on analysis at Princeton. Stein was also noted as having trained a high number of graduate students. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, Stein had at least 52 graduate students—including the Fields medalists Charles Fefferman and Terence Tao—some of whom went on to shape modern Fourier analysis.

His honors included the Steele Prize (1984 and 2002), the Schock Prize in Mathematics (1993), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (1999), and the National Medal of Science (2001). In addition, he had fellowships to National Science Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Guggenheim Foundation, and National Academy of Sciences. Stein was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982. In 2005, Stein was awarded the Stefan Bergman prize in recognition of his contributions in real, complex, and harmonic analysis. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

==Personal life==
In 1959, he married Elly Intrator. They had two children, Karen Stein and Jeremy C. Stein, and grandchildren named Alison, Jason, and Carolyn. His son Jeremy is a professor of financial economics at Harvard, former adviser to Tim Geithner and Lawrence Summers, and served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2012 to 2014. Elias Stein died of complications of lymphoma in 2018, aged 87.

In addition to being a common surname, it is also the name of a Chinese dynasty, the &quot;Song dynasty&quot;, written with the same character.

The first written record of the character (Sòng) was found on the oracle bones of the Shang dynasty.

===State of Song===
In the written records of Chinese history, the first time the character Song was used as a surname appeared in the early stage of the Zhou dynasty. One of the children of the last emperor of the Shang dynasty, Weizi Qi (微子启), was a duke from the state named Song, who descended from his ancestor Xie (契) whose name was derived from the surname Zi (子). Xie was born from Jiandi from the swallow from the blackbird egg, who came from Yousong (有娀), the legendary state. The State of Song, Song&#x27;s dominion, became part of the Zhou dynasty after the fall of the Shang dynasty, and was inherited from the dynasty formally in 11th century BC. Citizens of the former State of Song commemorated the overthrow of their state in 286 BC by the State of Qi owned by Tian, who began to use the character Song as their surname, which is the authentic branch.

*From the &quot;Taiping Guangji&quot;, The Duke Jing of Song assigned the surname Song to a savage, who was named Ziwei (子韦), in charge of astronomy as Fangshi, whose alias was Sixing (司星).

Previously, there was a person called Song Jian (宋建) from Fuhan, who was one of the leaders of Liang Province rebellion who belonged to the Qiang tribes.

*There is a family clan originally located in Pingyang called &quot;Dashila&quot; (答失剌) who have used this character since the Ming dynasty.

*Moreover, the surname branched off into a clan derived from an ancestor named &quot;Temuer&quot; or &quot;Timur&quot; (帖木儿) with the grant of a seal who used the character since Ming dynasty. From the history records, it may refer to Knight of Fenyang, who is the descendant of Godan Khan.

<text>A digital organism is a self-replicating computer program that mutates and evolves. Digital organisms are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Darwinian evolution, and to test or verify specific hypotheses or mathematical models of evolution. The study of digital organisms is closely related to the area of artificial life.

== History ==
Digital organisms can be traced back to the game Darwin, developed in 1961 at Bell Labs, in which computer programs had to compete with each other by trying to stop others from executing . A similar implementation that followed this was the game Core War. In Core War, it turned out that one of the winning strategies was to replicate as fast as possible, which deprived the opponent of all computational resources. Programs in the Core War game were also able to mutate themselves and each other by overwriting instructions in the simulated &quot;memory&quot; in which the game took place. This allowed competing programs to embed damaging instructions in each other that caused errors (terminating the process that read it), &quot;enslaved processes&quot; (making an enemy program work for you), or even change strategies mid-game and heal themselves.

Steen Rasmussen at Los Alamos National Laboratory took the idea from Core War one step further in his core world system by introducing a genetic algorithm that automatically wrote programs. However, Rasmussen did not observe the evolution of complex and stable programs. It turned out that the programming language in which core world programs were written was very brittle, and more often than not mutations would completely destroy the functionality of a program.

The first to solve the issue of program brittleness was Thomas S. Ray with his Tierra system, which was similar to core world. Ray made some key changes to the programming language such that mutations were much less likely to destroy a program. With these modifications, he observed for the first time computer programs that did indeed evolve in a meaningful and complex way.

Later, Chris Adami, Titus Brown, and Charles Ofria started developing their Avida system, which was inspired by Tierra but again had some crucial differences. In Tierra, all programs lived in the same address space and could potentially execute or otherwise interfere with each other&#x27;s code. In Avida, on the other hand, each program lives in its own address space. Because of this modification, experiments with Avida became much cleaner and easier to interpret than those with Tierra. With Avida, digital organism research has begun to be accepted as a valid contribution to evolutionary biology by a growing number of evolutionary biologists. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski of Michigan State University has used Avida extensively in his work. Lenski, Adami, and their colleagues have published in journals such as &quot;Nature&quot; and the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (USA).

In 1996, Andy Pargellis created a Tierra-like system called &quot;Amoeba&quot; that evolved self-replication from a randomly seeded initial condition. More recently &quot;REvoSim&quot; - a software package based around binary digital organisms - has allowed evolutionary simulations of large populations that can be run for geological timescales.
