<text>The Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (, , ; CSV or PCS) is the largest political party in Luxembourg. The party follows a Christian democratic and conservative ideology and has been described as centre to centre-right. Furthermore, akin to most parties in Luxembourg, it is strongly pro-European. The CSV is a member of the Christian Group, European People&#x27;s Party, and the Centrist Democrat International.

The CSV has been the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies since the party&#x27;s formation, and currently holds 21 of 60 seats in the Chamber. Since the Second World War, every Prime Minister of Luxembourg has been a member of the CSV, with only two exceptions: Gaston Thorn (1974–1979), and Xavier Bettel (2013–2023). It holds two of Luxembourg&#x27;s six seats in the European Parliament, as it has for 14 of the 44 years for which MEPs have been directly elected.

The party&#x27;s President has been Prime Minister Luc Frieden since March 2024. A leading figure from the party is the former prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, who previously governed in coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP) until the 2013 general election.

==History==

The earliest roots of the CSV date back to the foundation of the Party of the Right on 16 January 1914.

In December 1944, the Party of the Right was officially transformed into the Luxembourg Christian Social People&#x27;s Party. &quot;Luxembourg&quot; was dropped from the name by late March 1945. The first elections after the Second World War took place in 1945; the party won 25 out of 51 seats, missing an absolute majority by a single seat.

From 1945 to 1974, the party was in government and gave Luxembourg the following Prime Ministers: Pierre Dupong, Joseph Bech, Pierre Frieden, and Pierre Werner. Mostly in coalition with the Democratic Party (DP), it gave Luxembourg a certain economic and social stability.

In the 1950s, the party structure underwent a certain democratisation: the party&#x27;s youth section (founded in 1953) and women&#x27;s section received representation in the party&#x27;s central organs.

The party went into opposition for the first time in 1974, when the Democratic Party&#x27;s Gaston Thorn became Prime Minister in coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP). In 1979, the party returned to government after its victory in the 1979 general election; Pierre Werner became PM.

In 1984, Jacques Santer became PM. He remained as such until 1995, when Jean-Claude Juncker became PM, with Santer meanwhile taking up the post of President of the European Commission.

Following the 2013 general election, the party went into opposition for the second time in its history as the Democratic Party&#x27;s Xavier Bettel became Prime Minister in coalition with the LSAP and The Greens, making it the first time in Luxembourg&#x27;s history that a three-party coalition government had been formed. This also marked the first time that The Greens were part of a governmental coalition. Despite remaining the largest party, the result of the 2018 general election represented the lowest public support in the party&#x27;s history.

<doc id="424656" wikidata="Q5130292" url="?curid=424656" title="Clayton Christensen">
<text>Clayton Magleby Christensen (April 6, 1952 – January 23, 2020) was an American academic and business consultant who developed the theory of &quot;disruptive innovation&quot;, which has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century. Christensen introduced &quot;disruption&quot; in his 1997 book &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, and it led &quot;The Economist&quot; to term him &quot;the most influential management thinker of his time.&quot; He served as the Kim B. Clark Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School (HBS), and was also a leader and writer in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was one of the founders of the Jobs to Be Done development methodology.

Christensen was also a co-founder of Rose Park Advisors, a venture capital firm, and Innosight, a management consulting and investment firm specializing in innovation.

== Early life ==
Clayton Christensen was born on April 6, 1952, in Salt Lake City, Utah, the second of eight children born to Robert M. Christensen (1926–1976) and his wife, Verda Mae Christensen (&quot;née&quot; Fuller; 1922–2004). He grew up in the Rose Park neighborhood of Salt Lake City and attended West High School, where he was student body president. He was also an avid basketball player at tall. Christensen and his siblings were raised as members of the LDS Church.

== Education ==
=== Brigham Young University ===
After graduating from high school in 1970, Christensen was accepted to Harvard University, Yale University, and Brigham Young University (BYU). He &quot;decided to make the decision a matter of prayer&quot; and felt a &quot;clear impression&quot; to attend BYU, which had awarded him a full scholarship. Christensen majored in economics, and was classmates in his first-year economics course with future U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and future HBS dean Kim B. Clark. While at BYU, he took a two-year leave of absence from 1971 to 1973 to serve as a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. He was assigned to serve in South Korea and became a fluent speaker of Korean. Christensen returned to BYU after completing his missionary service, and in 1975 graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with honors with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics.

=== Oxford University ===
Following graduation from BYU, Christensen was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and spent two years studying applied econometrics at Oxford University&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s College, receiving a master&#x27;s degree in 1977. While at Oxford, Christensen was the starting center on the men&#x27;s basketball team, winning back-to-back British University Sports Federation championships in 1975 and 1976 and the English Basketball Association&#x27;s national championship for non-league teams in 1977.

=== Harvard University ===
Once Christensen completed his degree program at Oxford, he returned to the United States to attend HBS where he received an MBA with high distinction in 1979. He later returned to Harvard for his doctoral study in business, receiving a Doctor of Business Administration degree in 1992.

== Career ==
=== 1979–1989 ===
After receiving an MBA in 1979, Christensen began working for Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as a consultant and project manager. In 1982, he was named a White House Fellow and took a one-year leave of absence from BCG to work in Washington, D.C. as an assistant to the United States Secretary of Transportation, serving under both Drew Lewis and Elizabeth Dole. In 1984, he and several professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology founded an advanced ceramics company named Ceramics Process Systems Corporation (now known as CPS Technologies). Christensen served as its president and CEO through the late 1980s until he decided to leave the company to pursue a Doctor of Business Administration degree.

=== 1990–1999 ===
After completing his doctoral study, Christensen joined the HBS faculty and set a record by achieving the rank of full professor in only six years.

At HBS, he taught an elective course he designed named &quot;Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise&quot;, which teaches how to build and manage an enduring, successful company or transform an existing organization. He also taught in many of the school&#x27;s executive education programs. Christensen was awarded a full professorship with tenure in 1998 and held eight honorary doctorates and an honorary chaired professorship at the National Tsinghua University in Taiwan.

=== After 2000 ===
In 2000, he founded Innosight LLC, a consulting and training firm. In 2005, together with his colleagues at Innosight, he launched Innosight Ventures, a venture firm focused on investing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. In 2007, he co-founded Rose Park Advisors LLC (named after the neighborhood in Salt Lake City where he grew up), an investment company that applies his research as an investment strategy.

He served on the board of directors of Tata Consultancy Services (NSE: TCS), Franklin Covey (NYSE: FC), and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. He also served for a time on the editorial board of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;.

Christensen was the best-selling author of ten books, including his seminal work &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1997), which received the Global Business Book Award for the best business book of the year. One of the main concepts depicted in this book is also his most disseminated and famous one: disruptive innovation. The concept has been growing in interest over time since 2004, according to Google Trends data. However, due to constant misinterpretation, Christensen often wrote articles trying to explain the concept even further. Some of his other books are focused on specific industries and discuss social issues such as education and health care. &quot;Disrupting Class&quot; (2008) looks at the root causes of why schools struggle and offers solutions, while &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Prescription&quot; (2009) examines how to fix the American healthcare system. The latter two books received numerous awards as the best books on education and health care in their respective years of publication. &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Prescription&quot; was also awarded the 2010 James A. Hamilton Award, by the College of Healthcare Executives.

In 2017, Christensen predicted that “50 percent of the 4,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. will be bankrupt in 10 to 15 years.”

== Personal life ==
After returning to the United States from his LDS Church mission to South Korea, Christensen began serving with the Boy Scouts of America in a variety of roles. Over a period of 25 years, he served as scoutmaster, cub master, den leader, and as a troop and pack committee chairman.

Christensen and his wife, Christine (&quot;née&quot; Quinn), married in 1976. They had three sons, Matthew, Michael, and Spencer, and two daughters, Ann and Catherine. Their eldest son, Matthew (b. 1977), was a member of Duke University&#x27;s 2001 National Championship basketball team.

Christensen served in several leadership positions in the LDS Church, including as an area seventy from 2002 to 2009, a counselor in the presidency of the Massachusetts Boston Mission, and as a bishop. His book, &quot;The Power of Everyday Missionaries&quot;, was a leading work in the LDS Church on how all people could be involved in sharing the gospel no matter their position in the church. He was also a moving force behind the creation of &quot;For All The Saints&quot;, a book by Kristen Smith Dayley on the history of the LDS Church in New England, published in 2012 to which Christensen wrote the foreword.

Christensen was also very involved in his community of Belmont, Massachusetts. After moving his family to Belmont in the early 1990s to continue his education at HBS, he was elected to the Belmont Town Council where he served for eight years. Christensen was also instrumental in the use of internet learning for students of Belmont High School to decrease the rising costs of education.

In February 2010, Christensen was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma, and in July 2010 he had an ischemic stroke that damaged his speech and required him to undergo speech therapy. Christensen died from complications of leukemia on January 23, 2020, at age 67.

<text>A stamp catalog (or stamp catalogue) is a catalog of postage stamp types with descriptions and prices.

The stamp catalog is an essential tool of philately and stamp collecting. Stamp catalogs are part of philatelic literature.

Similar catalogs of other collectible objects. such as matchboxes (phillumeny) and postcards (deltiology), have also been issued.

== History ==
The first stamp catalog was published in France by Oscar Berger-Levrault on 17 September 1861 and the first illustrated catalog by Alfred Potiquet in December 1861 (based on the earlier work).

The first catalogs in Great Britain were published in 1862 by Frederick Booty, Mount Brown, and Dr. John Edward Gray. The first in the United States was &quot;The Stamp Collector&#x27;s Manual&quot; by A.C. Kline (a pseudonym for John William Kline), also 1862.

Originally catalogs were just dealers&#x27; price lists, though today that is less common. The catalogs of some major publishers continue to serve as an official price list for the publisher. For example, Stanley Gibbons in the United Kingdom specifically states in the catalog that the price listed is the estimated selling price by Stanley Gibbons Ltd. On the other had, Scott in the United States does not sell stamps. Rather, the Scott catalog serves as a reference document for expected prices used by buyers and sellers. Over time, as philately developed, catalogs tended to accumulate additional supporting details about the stamps, such as dates of issue, color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the Internet has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.

== Current catalogs ==
The following catalogs have a worldwide coverage:
*Michel - printed, software and online
*Scott - printed and online
*Stanley Gibbons - printed and online
*Yvert et Tellier - printed only

These are large undertakings, since there are thousands of new stamps to describe each year, and the prices of all stamps may go up or down. For publishers that are not dealers, the prices are estimated by data from dealers and auctions.

In addition, the catalog publishers usually put out specialized volumes with additional details, generally by nationality: Michel has a specialized German catalog, Scott a specialized US catalog, and so forth.

Many countries have their own &quot;national catalogs&quot;, typically put out by a leading publisher or dealer in that country. Postal administrations may themselves put out catalogs, although they tend to be aimed at less-experienced collectors, and rarely provide fully detailed stamp data. Some notable country catalogs include:

*ABDA (Philippines)
*Aerophil (Switzerland)
*AFA (Denmark)
*AFINSA (Portugal)
*Brusden-White (Australia)
*Edifil catalogs (Spain and its former colonies)

<text>The Democratic Opposition of Serbia (, abbr. DOS) was a wide electoral alliance of political parties in Serbia, intent on ousting the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia and its leader, Slobodan Milošević.

==History==
Its presidential candidate, Vojislav Koštunica, defeated Milošević in the 2000 general election, while the DOS secured a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The coalition was able to form a government and selected Zoran Đinđić for Prime Minister.

Koštunica&#x27;s Democratic Party of Serbia left the coalition government in July 2001, in protest of the governments decision to extradite Slobodan Milošević to the ICTY, and officially left the coalition in July next year. Social Democracy was pushed into the opposition in May 2001 after a split in the party, as the faction which was eventually recognized by the Supreme Court of Serbia as the legitimate name bearer, was not regarded as such by the DOS, which transferred all the positions held by the party members to the other faction&#x27;s adherents. That faction, having not received the legal recognition, had merged in July 2002 with the Social Democratic Union into the Social Democratic Party.

In March 2003, after a split in this party, the Social Democratic Union was renewed, still being a member of the DOS, while the Social Democratic Party was excluded from the coalition in November 2003, after having announced that it would support the opposition&#x27;s demand for government&#x27;s depose. In May 2003, New Serbia was excluded from the coalition after a series of conflicts with the other members. In 2003, New Democracy was renamed into the Liberals of Serbia, and the Association of Free and Independent Trade Unions founded the Labour Party of Serbia, to which it transferred its membership in the DOS.

Dragoljub Mićunović, the DOS candidate, performed poorly in the 2003 presidential election and was even beaten by 11% by Tomislav Nikolić, candidate of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party. Since only 38% of the electors voted, the presidential election was cancelled for the third time in a row. Therefore, the DOS was disbanded on 18 November 2003. The disbanding was mostly decided by the Democratic Party, the party founded by the then Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, who was later assassinated on 12 March 2003.

<text>The New Democratic Party of Serbia (, , abbr. NDSS), known as the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) until 2022, is a national-conservative political party in Serbia. Miloš Jovanović serves as the current president of NDSS.

DSS was formed as a conservative split from the Democratic Party (DS) and has played a key role in the opposition during the 1990s. It was a part of the &quot;Together&quot; coalition and was later a founding member of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS). Its first leader, Vojislav Koštunica, was elected president of Yugoslavia in 2000, a role which he served until 2003. DSS left the DOS government in 2001 and served in the opposition until the 2003 parliamentary election, after which it managed to form a government with other right-wing parties. Koštunica was appointed prime minister, and after 2008, it went to the opposition again after being unable to form a government. It saw its decline in the 2010s and failed to pass the threshold in the 2014 parliamentary election, leading to Koštunica resigning from the position as party leader. He was replaced by Sanda Rašković Ivić, and in 2016, DSS managed to enter the National Assembly again, this time in a coalition with Dveri. Rašković Ivić was ousted after the parliamentary election and was replaced by Miloš Jovanović as president of the party.

A former member of the European People&#x27;s Party, it maintained a centre-right and moderate conservative image until the early 2010s, when the party shifted to a more right-wing and eurosceptic position. It leads the National Democratic Alternative (NADA) coalition, which took part in the 2022 general election.

== History ==

=== 1992–2000 ===
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) was founded in 1992 by a breakaway nationalist faction of the Democratic Party (DS), which advocated involvement in the Democratic Movement of Serbia (DEPOS).

Founding members of the party were Vojislav Koštunica, Vladeta Janković, Đurđe Ninković, Draško Petrović, Mirko Petrović and Vladan Batić. The founding assembly was held on 26 July 1992 and elected Vojislav Koštunica as its first president. The first party assembly was held on 5 December 1992 and adopted the party&#x27;s first manifesto.
The DSS first competed in the December 1992 parliamentary elections. As part of DEPOS, the DSS received 18 seats in the National Assembly of Serbia - which grew to 20 after non-party-aligned members of DEPOS decided to leave the Parliament. Soon, similar differences of opinion over ways in which to fight the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia and the DSS&#x27;s belief in Serbian nationalism led to a division in DEPOS too. The DSS left the coalition in mid-1993.

Next parliamentary elections in Serbia were called prematurely for 19 December 1993. This time DSS ran independently and received seven seats. This was a period of the party&#x27;s political stagnation as most nationalist votes went to the Serbian Radical Party. It did not have enough seats to significantly influence matters in Serbia and was left without representation in the Federal Assembly.

In 1996, opposition &quot;Zajedno&quot; (Together) coalition was created. DSS entered the 1996 federal parliamentary elections as part of the coalition and won four seats in the Federal Assembly.

=== 2000–2008 ===
The DSS was a founding member of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) whose presidential candidate and leader of the DSS, Vojislav Koštunica defeated Slobodan Milošević in the 2000 Yugoslav presidential election held on 24 September 2000 winning 50.24% of the vote.

In the December 2000 Serbian parliamentary election, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia won 64.7% of the popular vote, securing 176 seats in the National Assembly. The DSS was allocated 45 seats. In the ensuing Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition government, DSS had very little influence with just two cabinet-level ministerial posts, that of Deputy Prime Minister (held by Aleksandar Pravdić) and Minister of Health (held by Obren Joksimović) as well as very few second tier posts of Deputy Minister. The DSS was unhappy with the direction of the DOS Government policy and split from the coalition in late 2001.

In the 2003 parliamentary election, the DSS won 17.7% of the popular vote, translating into 53 seats in the parliament. Of these 53 seats, three went to the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (NDS), one to the Serbian Liberal Party and one to the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS).

In 2004 NDS left the coalition with DSS, leaving it with 50 seats in the National Assembly. However, in 2005 both the NDS and the SDS merged into the DSS, bringing its size to 52 seats in the National Assembly.

The DSS won 47 seats in coalition with New Serbia in the 2007 parliamentary election, receiving 667,615 votes or 16.55% of the total popular vote. DSS itself received 33 seats in the parliament, and formed a group together with New Serbia, the Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement and United Serbia.

The leader of the DSS since its foundation, Vojislav Koštunica, was the Prime Minister of Serbia between March 2004 and July 2008 heading up two coalition governments. The first coalition government between March 2004 and July 2007 in coalition with Serbian Renewal Movement and G17 Plus. The second coalition government between July 2007 and July 2008 in coalition with the Democratic Party and G17 Plus.

=== 2008–2014===
In the early 2008 parliamentary election held in May 2008 following the self-proclaimed declaration of independence by the Serbian province of Kosovo, the DSS won 30 seats in the National Assembly in coalition with New Serbia. It won 480,987 votes representing 11.62% of the electorate. In coalition with New Serbia 2008–10, it formed the second largest opposition block in the Serbian parliament.

Since 2008 the DSS has positioned itself as a staunch defender of the premise that Kosovo should remain within Serbia (in some shape or form) and that further negotiations must take place to determine a workable political outcome regarding Kosovo and Serbia. Because of this approach, the DSS is against Serbia joining the EU if in return it is bound to acknowledge the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed independent Kosovo.

The party has become increasingly nationalist and eurosceptic since the independence of Kosovo. In 2012, Vojislav Koštunica stated that the EU is destroying Serbia and that Serbia should abstain on EU membership. The party subsequently left the European People&#x27;s Party in February 2012.

The party competed independently in the 2012 parliamentary elections in May 2012 and received around 7% of the popular vote (273,532 votes) translating into 21 Members of Parliament.

=== 2014–present ===
In 2014, founder and first president of DSS Vojislav Koštunica left the party over its abandonment of the idea of political neutrality. Subsequently, Slobodan Samardžić, Dragan Jočić, Vladeta Janković and Dejan Mihajlov also announced their departure in response to differences of opinion over the course of DSS.

On 26 January 2021, DSS and the Movement for the Restoration of the Kingdom of Serbia (POKS) signed an agreement on joint action and agreed on a joint political-program platform called the &quot;National-Democratic Alternative&quot;. In early May, the &quot;National-Democratic Alternative&quot; was transformed into a pre-electoral coalition. On 24 May, the 14th party assembly was held in which Jovanović was re-elected as the president of the party, while Dejan Šulkić, Zoran Sandić, and Predrag Marsenić were elected as vice-presidents. DSS changed its name to New Democratic Party of Serbia following the 15th assembly on 29 May 2022.

== Political positions ==
Initially aligned on the centre-right on the political spectrum, it has shifted to the right-wing in the early 2010s. A national-conservative party, it is strongly opposed to the accession of Serbia to the European Union. It has been also described as conservative, nationalist, and populist. It was historically supportive of Western integration and European Union, and was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party until 2012.

Together with the People&#x27;s Party, Serbian Party Oathkeepers, and Dveri, it signed a joint declaration for the &quot;reintegration of Kosovo into the constitutional and legal order of Serbia&quot; in October 2022.

In the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, DSS was associated with the European People&#x27;s Party until 2012, after which it became a member of the European Democrat Group until 2014.

<text>In music, a dyad (less commonly, diad) is a set of two notes or pitches. The notes of a dyad can be played simultaneously or in succession. Notes played in succession form a melodic interval; notes played simultaneously form a harmonic interval.

Dyads can be classified by the interval between the notes. For example, the interval between C and E (four half steps) is a major third, which can imply a C major chord, made up of the notes C, E and G.

<doc id="424673" wikidata="Q1325730" url="?curid=424673" title="White House Fellows">
<text>The White House Fellows program is a non-partisan fellowship established via Executive Order 11183 by President Lyndon B. Johnson in October 1964. The fellowship is one of the United States&#x27; most prestigious programs for leadership and public service, offering exceptional US citizens first-hand experience working at the highest levels of the federal government. The fellowship was founded based upon a suggestion from John W. Gardner, then the president of Carnegie Corporation and later the sixth secretary of health, education, and welfare.

White House Fellows spend a year working as a full-time, paid special assistant or advisor to senior White House staff, cabinet secretaries, the vice president, or the head of an independent executive-branch agency. Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with leaders from the private and public sectors. These roundtables are augmented through observation of policy in action, including domestic and international engagements with foreign dignitaries, industry executives, elected officials, and civil servants. 

The selection process to become a White House Fellow is very competitive, with fellowships awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis. Each year after the application period closes, the staff of the President&#x27;s Commission on White House Fellowships (PCWHF) processes the applications and former fellows screen the applications to identify approximately one hundred of the most promising candidates. These selected individuals are then interviewed by several regional panels, which are composed of prominent local citizens. Based on the results of these interviews, the regional panelists and the director of the PCWHF select approximately thirty candidates to proceed as national finalists. The PCWHF will then interview these finalists, recommending between 11 and 19 of them to the president for a one-year appointment through the White House Office. The program can receive more than 2,000 applicants per year, with a selection rate often of 1% or less. Selected civilians serve as Schedule A presidential appointees, while military members will be assigned to duty at the PCWHF at 712 Jackson Place, Washington, D.C.

Once fellows complete their year of service, they join hundreds of other fellows as alumni of the program. The White House Fellows Foundation and Association is the organization that represents the White House Fellows alumni efforts, leadership events and fundraising activities.

==Demographics==

When the White House Fellows program was established in 1964, the program required that all fellows meet the following criteria:

*Have demonstrated unusual ability, high moral character, outstanding motivation, and a broad capacity for leadership.

*Show exceptional promise of future development.

*Are dedicated to the institutions of the United States and the values of American civilization.

*Will have attained the age of twenty-three but not the age of thirty-six prior to the beginning of their service.

*Shall be selected by the President without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, creed, national origin, or political affiliation.
*Citizens of the United States.

These initial criteria have been slightly modified over the years. In 1976, criteria were modified to disqualify regular federal employees and reaffirm that military personnel remained eligible. This same executive order decreased the term of the fellowship from 15 months to 12 (though EO 12653 again revised the duration to be extended at the commission&#x27;s discretion back up to 15 months).

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter revised the criteria again under Executive Order 12012. In this case, the explicit age requirement was removed. Instead, an emphasis was added such that fellows must be, &quot;...early in their chosen careers...&quot;



Since the inception of the program, White House Fellows have come from a variety of backgrounds.
* The ten universities most frequently attended by White House Fellows are, in order: Harvard, Stanford, West Point, Oxford, MIT, Columbia, the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy, Berkeley, and Yale.
* The average age of a Fellow is mid-30s.
* A total of 251 women have been selected as White House Fellows since the program’s creation in 1964. They represent 28% of the 879 people who have served as White House Fellows. The percentage of women has increased over time, as shown by the statistics below:
**1960s: 7 of 86 – 8% women
**1970s: 36 of 158 – 23% women
**1980s: 33 of 135 – 24% women
**1990s: 52 of 159 – 33% women
**2000s: 38 of 131 – 29% women
**2010s: 54 of 145 – 37% women
**2020s: 31 of 63 – 49% women

* A broad range of career backgrounds are represented. Fellows&#x27; professions include physicians, lawyers, teachers, military officers, scientists, non-profit leaders, engineers, CEOs, entrepreneurs, academics, and many more.

===Undergraduate education===
* Earned bachelor&#x27;s degree: 100%

==The President&#x27;s Commission on White House Fellowships==

The Presidents Commission on White House Fellowships (PCWHF) consists of the program office (the Director, staff, and White House Fellows) and the Commission (the commissioners and their Chairperson).

==The White House Fellows Foundation &amp; Association==
The White House Fellows Foundation &amp; Association (WHFFA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to &quot;supporting the White House Fellows educational program financially, to broaden the foundation members’ understanding of government and the problems confronting government, and to encourage members’ contribution to public service and the education of the public.&quot; Activities funded by the WHFFA support alumni and current cohort members. This includes supporting a portion of seminar costs for the White House Fellows&#x27; educational program, an annual meeting of alumni, and recruiting applicants for the White House Fellows program.

The WHFFA is governed by a board of directors who are voted on by dues paying members. The board has the authority to hire an executive director to conduct affairs on behalf of the WHFFA. Only White House Fellows alumni are eligible to join the WHFFA. The WHFFA revenue is derived from member dues, investment income, and donations. The WHFFA president is an ex officio member of the PCWHF. 

==Programs inspired by the White House Fellows==
Due to the successes and longevity of the White House Fellows program, latter administrations have introduced other distinct fellowships with similar names. Though the White House Fellows program is the only dedicated to service at the highest levels of government and the only administered from within the White House, these more recent programs have succeeded in serving their unique objectives over the years. 

===Presidential Management Fellows===
The Presidential Management Fellows program existed to recruit recent college graduates and graduate students in order to develop a core of future government leaders. Those selected were hired at federal pay grades starting at GS-9 and serve for a period of two years. Presidential Management Fellows were administered via the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. More than 500 Presidential Management Fellows were selected annually, with a selection rate of approximately 10%. The Presidential Management Fellows Program was initially established as the Presidential Management Intern Program in 1977.

===Presidential Innovation Fellows===
The Presidential Innovation Fellows Program seeks to embed industry’s top technologists and innovators within federal agencies for a period of one year. The program typically recruits 20–35 fellows for each new cohort and charges them with helping to solve the nation’s toughest challenges and emerging issues. The program was initiated by President Barack Obama in 2012 and later codified via the TALENT Act in 2017. It is administered by the General Services Administration.

===White House Leadership Development Program Fellows===
The White House Leadership Development Program is designed to provide senior level federal employees (GS-15 and equivalent) with exposure to cross-agency priority challenges. It was established by President Barack Obama on December 9, 2014. The program is sponsored by the Executive Office of the President and is administered by the General Services Administration.

<text>Vojislav Koštunica (; born 24 March 1944) is a Serbian former politician who served as the last president of FR Yugoslavia from 2000 to 2003 and as the prime minister of Serbia from 2004 to 2008.

Koštunica won the 2000 Yugoslav presidential election as a candidate of a broad alliance Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which led to overthrow of Slobodan Milošević and the withdrawal of international sanctions against Yugoslavia. He strictly opposed cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and his party left the coalition government in protest at the decision to extradite Slobodan Milošević to the ICTY. After the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election, the first elections after the dissolution of DOS and assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, Koštunica formed a minority government with the support of Milošević&#x27;s Socialist Party of Serbia and became the head of government. He was one of the crucial figures in the adoption of the first constitution of an independent Serbia, as well as for declaring Serbia a neutral country. During his second government (2007–2008), he opposed signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union, leading to the fall of the government after a year and the early elections won by pro-European parties. 

He was one of the founders and the first president of the Democratic Party of Serbia from its creation in 1992 until 19 March 2014, when he resigned as party president and retired from active politics after his party failed to reach the 5% threshold to enter the Parliament on March 16 elections for the first time in its history. In October 2014, he left the party after disagreements with the new party leadership over what he saw as their abandonment of the policy of political neutrality. In November 2014, he was one of the founders of the right-wing eurosceptic &quot;Statehood Movement of Serbia&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Koštunica was born on 24 March 1944 in his family home in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. As a youth he went by the nickname &#x27;Voja&#x27;. He was educated in Belgrade, where he finished elementary school, and graduated from the Second Belgrade High School in 1962. Koštunica enrolled in the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Law the same year, graduating in 1966. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1970 and his Ph.D. in 1974 with his thesis &quot;Institutionalized Opposition in the Political System of Capitalism&quot;.

Koštunica was an assistant at the faculty from 1970 until 1974, when he left due to a political purge at the university for criticising the communist regime of Josip Broz Tito. After his expulsion, Koštunica worked at the Institute of Social Sciences, and from 1981 at the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory, where he engaged in the protection of human rights, specifically in the defence of freedom of thought and expression.

==Political career==
Koštunica was a founding member of the Democratic Party (DS) in 1989. He left the Democratic Party in 1992 over opposing views in leadership and formed the Democratic Party of Serbia.

===President of Yugoslavia (2000–03)===
Supported by both nationalists and liberals, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia backed him in the 2000 presidential election against incumbent Slobodan Milošević. Koštunica received 50.2 percent of the vote in the first round of voting, just a few thousand votes over the threshold needed to win outright. Milošević disputed the results of the first round, claiming that Koštunica had only received 49 percent of the vote and a runoff was required. The Otpor movement, a student-led movement to oust Milošević and install free and fair elections, organized a protest where thousands of Serbians participated in strikes and took over the Belgrade capital and forced Milošević to accept the results and step down as president. Koštunica then assumed the presidency. He was the last president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Koštunica opposed the extradition of his predecessor, to the Hague Tribunal, and voiced opposition to the court.

===Prime Minister of Serbia (2004–08)===

Koštunica became prime minister in March 2004 at the head of the new minority government, albeit with the support of the Socialist Party of Serbia. 

Serbian parliamentary elections in January 2007 were inconclusive. On 15 May 2007 Koštunica agreed to form a fragile coalition government with Boris Tadić, with Koštunica continuing his role as Prime Minister and Tadić&#x27;s party receiving 13 of 25 cabinet posts.

On 8 March 2008, Koštunica called for new elections on 11 May after the collapse of his party&#x27;s coalition with the Democratic Party over relations with the European Union and Kosovo&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence. Pro-EU candidate Boris Tadić and his Democratic Party wound up winning the parliamentary elections and on July 7, a coalition between the Democrats and the Socialist Party was formed with Mirko Cvetković succeeding Koštunica as Prime Minister.

==Political positions==
Koštunica is a conservative politician with strong anti-communist views but also critical of the West, namely the United States and the European Union. In an interview with German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, Koštunica stated he is &quot;fairly close to de Gaulle&quot;, in his views.

===On Kosovo===
On 21 February 2008, following Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence, Koštunica made an emotional speech in Belgrade, which included the following: Buses took thousands of supporters to the rally; some protestors then attacked embassies and looted shops.

On 25 February 2008, Koštunica demanded that the United States rescind its recognition of Kosovo, warning that &quot;there will be no stability until the fake state&quot; is annulled.

===On the European Union=== 

On 4 April 2008, Koštunica stated that European Union membership was no longer on the agenda for Serbia. He stated that before EU integration could continue, Serbia and the EU must discuss the matter of Serbia&#x27;s territorial integrity.

He stated that Serbia must not by any means sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which he referred to as &quot;Solana&#x27;s agreement&quot;.

On 21 April 2008 Koštunica said that the SAA was in the interests of Olli Rehn and Javier Solana and not in Serbia&#x27;s national interests. He also said that &quot;the NATO pact cannot claim that Serbia recognised Kosovo’s independence with that signature.&quot; and that &quot;the only thing the NATO pact will be able to claim is that individual parties signed Solana’s agreement.&quot;

On 27 April 2008 he said that anyone who signed the SAA on behalf of Serbia would become an accomplice to tearing Serbia apart. He also implied there is a cover-up of something in the agreement by saying: &quot;I am convinced every Serbian sees that things are being covered up, and that there is something seriously amiss with the Solana agreement.&quot; and he asked &quot;who in Serbia dares to ignore these facts and conceal the real goal of Solana&#x27;s agreement.&quot;

On 28 April 2008 he said that &quot;the signature will not be valid for Serbia and whoever signs the SAA will have to assume responsibility for such an act&quot;.

On 1 May 2008 Koštunica said that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was right when he said that the SAA should have been signed before Kosovo&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence and its recognition by 18 EU member states at the time. One day later on 2 May 2008 he vowed to annul the agreement after the election, calling it &quot;a trick&quot;, &quot;Solana&#x27;s agreement&quot; and &quot;the Tadić-Đelić SAA signature&quot;. He said he refers to the act of signing of the SAA as anti-Constitutional and anti-state that leads to the breakup of Serbia. A spokesperson of Koštunica&#x27;s Democratic Party of Serbia stated that Tadić was putting a seal of Judas of his party coalition to the Solana Agreement by signing it. On 4 May he called the document &quot;a forgery and a trick&quot;.

<text>The Homeland (), previously known as the National Democratic Party of Germany (, NPD), is a far-right neo-Nazi and ultranationalist political party in Germany.

The party was founded in 1964 as successor to the German Reich Party (, DRP). Party statements also self-identified the party as Germany&#x27;s &quot;only significant patriotic force&quot; (2012). On 1 January 2011, the nationalist German People&#x27;s Union merged with the NPD and the party name of the National Democratic Party of Germany was extended by the addition of &quot;The People&#x27;s Union&quot;.

As a neo-Nazi organization, it has been referred to as &quot;the most significant neo-Nazi party to emerge after 1945&quot;. The German Federal Agency for Civic Education, or BPB, has criticized the NPD for working with members of organizations which were later found unconstitutional by the federal courts and disbanded, while the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&#x27;s domestic security agency, classifies The Homeland as a &quot;threat to the constitutional order&quot; because of its platform and ideology, and it is under their observation. An effort to outlaw the party failed in 2003, as the government had many informers and agents in the party, some in high position, who had written part of the material used against them. Since its founding in 1964, the party has never managed to win enough votes on the federal level to cross Germany&#x27;s 5% minimum threshold for representation in the Bundestag; it has succeeded in crossing the 5% threshold and gaining representation in state parliaments 11 times, including one-convocation entry to seven West German state parliaments between November 1966 and April 1968 and two-convocation electoral success in two East German states of Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern between 2004 and 2011. Since 2016, The Homeland has not been represented in state parliaments. Udo Voigt led the NPD from 1996 to 2011. He was succeeded by Holger Apfel, who in turn was replaced by Udo Pastörs in December 2013. In November 2014, Pastörs was ousted and Frank Franz became the party&#x27;s leader. Voigt was elected the party&#x27;s first Member of the European Parliament in 2014. The party lost the seat in the 2019 European Parliament election. In June 2023, the party renamed itself to after a party vote.

On 23 January 2024, the Federal Constitutional Court excluded the party from party funding for six years, arguing that it continued to oppose the fundamental principles that are indispensable for the free democratic constitutional state and aimed to eliminate them.

==History==
===20th century===
In the 1950s, despite the lack of complete de-Nazification, early right-wing extremist parties in West Germany failed to attract voters away from the moderate government that had presided over Germany&#x27;s recovery.

Adolf von Thadden was active in far-right politics in the West Germany and was elected to the Bundestag in 1949. Thadden supported Werner Naumann, an associate of Joseph Goebbels, after his arrest and included him on the Deutsche Reichspartei&#x27;s (DRP) list of candidates for the 1953 election. However, the government removed Naumann as a candidate and the party only received around 1% of the vote. Thadden then worked with Wilhelm Meinberg, a Nazi Reichstag member and recipient of the Golden Party Badge, and Heinrich Kunstmann, who joined the Nazi Party before Adolf Hitler. Both Meinberg and Kunstmann served as chairs of the DRP. Thadden replaced Kunstmann as chair in 1961 after continued electoral failures. Thadden&#x27;s DRP allied with the BHE and German Party (DP) for the 1951 Bremen elections as none of the parties were strong enough to win on their own. This alliance received 5.2% of the vote and gained 4 seats in the bürgerschaft.

On 28 November 1964, around 600 people met in the banqueting hall of the Döhrener Maschpark inn in Bonn at the invitation of Friedrich Thielen. The National Democratic Party of Germany was formed at this meeting and 437 of those in attendance became members. Thielen was selected to be chair of the party. Thadden, who proposed the unification of Germany&#x27;s far-right parties, was made deputy chair. The newspaper he co-owned, &quot;Deutsche Nachrichten&quot; became the NPD&#x27;s newspaper. The DRP, BHE, DP, and German National People&#x27;s Party merged into the NPD. The NPD was organised in 196 of 248 federal election districts by April 1965. The party&#x27;s first convention was held on 7–9 May 1965 in Hannover with 1,007 delegates and 2,000 non-delegates in attendance while. The party&#x27;s membership of 7,500 was far smaller than the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)&#x27;s 390,000 and Social Democratic Party&#x27;s 700,000.

Thadden believed that 30% of the national voting public were undecided and that 15% could be swayed to support the NPD in the 1965 federal election. He launched a national car convey for the campaign starting in Cologne. Thielen and other members of the party laid wreathes on the graves of Nazi war criminals at Landsberg Prison. High profile people joined the party, such as Olympic gold medalist Frank Schepke and rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth. The NPD received 2% of the vote, below the 5% needed to gain seats and the 15% claimed in party propaganda.

Thadden served as chairman from 1967 to 1971. Owing to von Thadden&#x27;s effective leadership the NPD achieved success in the late 1960s, winning local government seats across West Germany. In 1966 and 1967, fueled by West German discontent with a lagging economy and with the leadership of Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, the NPD won 15 seats in Bavaria, 10 in lower Saxony, 8 in Hesse, and several other seats. However, the NPD did not then and has never since received the minimum 5% of votes in federal elections that allow a party to send delegates to the German Parliament. The NPD came closest to that goal in the 1969 election, when it received 4.3 percent of the vote.

Helping pave the way for these NPD gains were an economic downturn, frustrations with the emerging leftist youth counter-culture, and the emergence of a tripartite Grand Coalition among the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Christian Social Union (the CDU&#x27;s present-day sister party), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). The coalition government had created a vacuum in the traditional political right wing, which the NPD tried to fill. Additionally, the party benefited from hostility to the growing immigrant population and fears that the government would relinquish claims to the &quot;lost territories&quot; (pre-World War II German territory east of the Oder-Neisse River). The historian Walter Laqueur has argued that the NPD in the 1960s cannot be classified as a neo-Nazi party.

In late 1965, Thielen wanted somebody other than Thadden to lead the party in Lower Saxony, but Thadden ignored this and was elected chair. Thielen had Thadden expelled from the party, but Thadden used his allies in the executive committee to expel Thielen. Thadden was appointed to replace Thielen as chair of the national party. Thielen broke away to form the Nationale Volkspartei (NVP), but only a few hundred of the NPD&#x27;s 25,000 members joined him. , the chair of the Bavarian affiliate, resigned a few months later stating that the party was under the control of right-wing extremists.

When the coalition fell apart, around 75 percent of those who had voted for the NPD drifted back to the centre-right. During the 1970s, the NPD went into decline, suffering from an internal split over failing to get into the German Parliament. The issue of immigration spurred a small rebound in popular interest from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, but the party only saw limited success in various local elections.

===Recent history===
In September 2019, NPD politician Stefan Jagsch was elected as representative of Altenstadt-Waldsiedlung. The unanimous election of the NPD politician by the local council led to irritation and horror in other parties, such as Angela Merkel&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), whose local council members had voted for Jagsch.

====Electoral history====
Since its founding in 1964, The Homeland has only won seats in regional assemblies. Its successes in state parliaments can be grouped into two periods: the late 1960s (1966 in Hesse; 1967 in Bremen, Lower Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Schleswig-Holstein; and 1968 in Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria), and former East Germany since reunification (2006 and 2011 in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, 2004 and 2009 in Saxony).

In the 2004 state election in Saxony, the NPD won 9.2% of the overall vote. After the 2009 state election in Saxony, the NPD sent eight representatives to the Saxony state parliament, having lost four representatives since the 2004 election. The NPD lost their representation in Saxony in the 2014 state election. They also lost all representation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the 2016 state election.

The NPD maintained a non-competition agreement with the German People&#x27;s Union (DVU) between 2004 and 2009. The third nationalist-oriented party, the Republicans (REP), has so far refused to join this agreement. However, Kerstin Lorenz, a local representative of the Republicans in Saxony, sabotaged her party&#x27;s registration to help the NPD in the Saxony election.

In the 2005 federal elections, the NPD received 1.6 percent of the vote nationally. It garnered the highest percent of votes in the states of Saxony (4.9 percent), Thuringia (3.7 percent), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (3.5 percent) and Brandenburg (3.2 percent), all formerly part of East Germany. In most other states, the party won around 1 percent of the total votes cast. In the 2006 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, the NPD received 7.3% of the vote and thus achieved state representation there, as well.

The NPD had 5,300 registered party members in 2004. Over the course of 2006, the NPD processed roughly 2,000 party applications to push the membership total over 7,200. In 2008, the trend of a growing number of members has been reversed and the party&#x27;s membership is estimated at 7,000.

In the 2014 European elections, Udo Voigt was elected as the party&#x27;s first Member of the European Parliament.

====2001–2003 banning attempt====
In 2001, the federal government, the Bundestag, and the Bundesrat jointly attempted to have the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ban the NPD. The court, the highest court in Germany, has the exclusive power to ban parties if they are found to be &quot;anti-constitutional&quot; through the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. However, the petition was rejected in 2003 after it was discovered that a number of the NPD&#x27;s inner circle, including as many as 30 of its top 200 leaders, were undercover agents or informants of the German secret services, like the federal Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz. They include a former deputy chairman of the party and author of an anti-Semitic tract that formed a central part of the government&#x27;s case. Since the secret services were unwilling to fully disclose their agents&#x27; identities and activities, the court found it impossible to decide which moves by the party were based on genuine party decisions and which were controlled by the secret services in an attempt to further the ban. The court determined that so many of the party&#x27;s actions were influenced by the government that the resulting &quot;lack of clarity&quot; made it impossible to defend a ban. &quot;The presence of the state at the leadership level makes influence on its aims and activities unavoidable,&quot; it concluded.

Horst Mahler, a former member of the far-left terrorist organization Red Army Faction, defended the NPD in court. In May 2009, several state politicians published an extensive document which they claim proves the NPD&#x27;s opposition to the constitution without relying on information supplied by undercover agents. This move was intended to lead up to a second attempt to have the NPD banned.

====Merger with DVU====

At the 2010 NPD party conference at Bamberg it was announced that the party would ask its members to approve a merger with the German People&#x27;s Union (DVU). After the merger on 1 January 2011, the combined party briefly used the name &quot;NPD – Die Volksunion&quot; (NPD - The People&#x27;s Union). Between 2004 and 2009 the two parties had agreed not to compete against each other in elections. However, on 27 January 2011, Munich&#x27;s &quot;Landgericht&quot; (regional court) in a preliminary injunction declared the merger null and void.

====The Green Movement====
The Homeland has recently supported the green movement. This is one of many strategies the party has used to try to gain supporters. Historically the opposing party the German Greens have fully supported the green movement in Germany. The German Greens group was a successful European ecological group that began in 1980. Kate Connolly who is a correspondent for The Guardian wrote the article: &quot;German far-right extremists tap into green movement for support&quot;. In the article Connolly explains the opposition between these two political groups pertaining to the green movement. The Artaman league is essential in understanding the green movements history. This was a farming movement that was inspired by the &quot;blood and soil&quot; ruralist ideology adopted from the Nazis. This farming movement affected the Mecklenburg region of Germany during the 19th century. Settlers at this time took advantage of the cheap cost of land in these rural communities. These settlers were in support of the Artaman league and continued to reinforce the ideology.

The NPD&#x27;s plans are to take the ecological movement back from the German Greens group. Connolly spoke to different farmers, organizations, and employees of the government to represent the different perspectives of the ecological movement. Hans-Gunter Laimer, a farmer who ran for office for the NPD, mentions his frustration that the German Greens groups has dominated the organic farming market for too long. He has also been linked to other German groups specifically Umwelt and Aktiv. Both political parties are concerned with the ways they are in opposition to one another. The Homeland supporters of the green movement are in favor of local produce. However, they are against GMOS, pesticides, and intensive livestock. Organizations involved in the farming industry have lost consumers because they are not able to state what the political views of the farmers products are to the consumer. For example, BioPark is an organic cultivation organization with a vetting process to certify organic farmers. The vetting process is strictly based on cultivation methods and not on political affiliations. BioPark has lost customers because left-leaning supporters worry buying local organic produce is supporting the far-right extremist.

The department of rural enlightenment has supported the importance of distinguishing between these two political parties. The department created a brochure called &quot;Nature Conservation Versus Right-wing Extremist&quot;. The brochure was created in order to help consumers distinguish from the far-right extremists. Other representatives from the government have spoken on this divide. For example, Connolly mentions a representative of the Centre for Democratic culture in Mecklenburg who chose to stay anonymous in order to protect themself. The representative stated the goal of the NPD is to build bridges between citizens. The NPD is strategic in the way they are going about this in a subtle quite manner. The result the NPD is trying to achieve is to reinforce the division between the two political parties for when NPD no longer becomes associated with politics.

====World War II and Holocaust commemoration controversies====
In 2005, the Landtag of Saxony held a minute of silence for the victims of Nazi Germany. Holger Apfel, leader of the NPD in Saxony and deputy leader of the party nationwide, boycotted the remembrance along with 11 other NPD politicians and staged a walkout from the Landtag chamber. He also gave a speech in which he demanded a moment of silence be held for the victims of the bombing of Dresden in 1945 and called the Allies of World War II &quot;mass murderers&quot;, stating that &quot;Today we in this parliament are taking up the political battle for historical truth, and against the servitude of guilt of the German people... The causes of the holocaust bombing of Dresden have nothing to do with either 1 September 1939 or with 30 January 1933.&quot; Apfel&#x27;s speech caused politicians from other parties in the Landtag to walk out in protest.

Udo Voigt voiced his support for Apfel&#x27;s and reiterated the statement, which some controversially claimed was a violation of the German law which forbids Holocaust denial. However, after a judicial review, it was decided that Voigt&#x27;s description of the Allied bombing of Dresden as a &quot;holocaust&quot; was an exercise of free speech and &quot;defamation of the dead&quot; was not the purpose of his statement.

In 2009, the NPD joined the Junge Landsmannschaft Ostdeutschland in a demonstration on the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden in World War II. Roughly 6,000 people came to participate in the event.

===Activism and controversy===

The NPD&#x27;s strategy has been to create &quot;nationally liberated zones&quot; and circumvent its marginal electoral status by concentrating on regions where support is strongest. In March 2006, musician Konstantin Wecker tried to set up an in-school anti-fascist concert in Halberstadt, Saxony-Anhalt two weeks before the state elections. The NPD argued that because of politics, the date and the in-school venue, the concert &quot;was an unacceptable form of political campaigning.&quot; In protest, the NPD vowed to buy the tickets and turn up en masse at Wecker&#x27;s show, which led local authorities to cancel the event. The Social Democrats and the Greens were outraged by the decision, which the Central Council of Jews in Germany criticized as &quot;politically bankrupt&quot;.

The NPD was going to sponsor a march through Leipzig on 21 June 2006, as the 2006 World Cup was going on. The party wanted to show its support for the Iranian national football team, which was playing in Leipzig, and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. However, the NPD decided against the demonstration; only a counter-demonstration took place that day, in support of Israel. During the World Cup, the party&#x27;s web site stated that due to the prevalence of people of non-German descent on the Germany national football team, the team &quot;was not really German&quot;.

Later in 2006, the party designed leaflets, which said &quot;White – not just the color of a jersey! For a true National team!&quot; This leaflet was never mass-distributed, but copies were confiscated during a raid on the NPD&#x27;s headquarters, when authorities had been hoping to find material linking the party to Nazism. Patrick Owomoyela was later informed about the poster after it was noted that the image depicted a footballer wearing a white jersey with Owomoyela&#x27;s number on it. Owomoyela, of Nigerian descent, had played for the Germany national team in the years before the World Cup and proceeded to file a lawsuit against the party. The party was able to delay the procedures but in April 2009 three party officials, Udo Voigt, Frank Schwerdt, and Klaus Beier, were convicted of (incitement to hatred). Voigt and Beier were sentenced to 7 months of probation, and Schwerdt was sentenced to 10 months of probation.

In November 2008, shortly after the 2008 United States presidential election, the NPD published a document entitled &quot;Africa conquers the White House&quot; which stated that the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American President of the United States was the result of &quot;the American alliance of Jews and Negroes&quot; and that Obama aimed to destroy the United States&#x27; &quot;white identity&quot;. The NPD claimed, &quot;A non-white America is a declaration of war on all people who believe an organically grown social order based on language and culture, history and heritage to be the essence of humanity&quot; and &quot;Barack Obama hides this declaration of war behind his pushy sunshine smile.&quot; The NPD also stated that the extensive support for Obama in Germany &quot;resembles an African tropical disease.&quot;

In September 2009, another incident involving the NPD and a football player of the Germany national team was reported. In a television show of a regional channel, NPD spokesman Beier called midfielder Mesut Özil a &quot;Plaste-Deutscher&quot; (&quot;Plastic German&quot; or &quot;ID Card German&quot;), meaning someone who is not born German, but becomes German by naturalization, particularly for certain benefits. The German Football Association announced that they would immediately file a lawsuit against the NPD and their spokesman, if requested by Özil.

During the Gaza War in 2009, the NPD planned a &quot;Holocaust&quot; vigil for Gaza in support of the Palestinians. Charlotte Knobloch, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said &quot;joint hatred of everything Jewish is unifying neo-Nazis and Islamists.&quot; Knobloch claimed German-Palestinian protestors &quot;unashamedly admitted&quot; that they would vote for the NPD during the next election.

In 2009, the NPD hung anti-Polish posters with slogan &quot;Polen-Invasion Stoppen&quot; (&quot;Stop the Polish invasion&quot;) in Dresden and Görlitz. Mayor of Görlitz and then Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, condemned the posters.

In April 2009, the party was fined 2.5 million euros for filing incorrect financial statements, resulting, according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, in &quot;serious financial trouble&quot; for its administration.

On 23 September 2009, four days before the federal elections, German police raided the Berlin headquarters of the NPD to investigate claims that letters sent from the NPD to politicians from immigrant backgrounds incited racial hatred. The NPD leader in Berlin defended the letters saying that &quot;As part of a democracy, we&#x27;re entitled to say if something doesn&#x27;t suit us in this country.&quot;

On 24 June 2024, it was announced that two parliamentary groups consisting of members of the AfD and &quot;Die Heimat&quot; had been formed in the Brandenburg town of Lauchhammer and the district of Oberspreewald-Lausitz. In Lauchhammer, the joint parliamentary group will be represented in the town council under the name &quot;AfDplus&quot;, while the &quot;Heimat &amp; Zukunft&quot; parliamentary group has been formed in the district council of Oberspreewald-Lausitz. Thomas Gürtler from &quot;Die Heimat&quot; will play a leading role in both bodies. This development is seen as the first official coalition between the AfD and the far-right party &quot;Die Heimat&quot;. The formation of the parliamentary groups was supported by statements made by AfD chairman Tino Chrupalla, who emphasised that there would be no &quot;firewalls&quot; to other parties at local level.

====2011 banning attempt====
In 2011, authorities were reportedly trying to link the party, and specifically 30-year-old national organization director Patrick Wieschke, to the so-called &quot;Zwickau terrorist cell&quot;. This raised the possibility of another effort to outlaw the party. The cell had been implicated in a string of murders and the November robbery of a savings bank in Eisenach. Authorities were also pursuing a gun case against Ralf Wohlleben, former deputy chairman of the party&#x27;s branch in Thuringia, though the latter case was reportedly unlikely to translate into a national-level challenge to the party&#x27;s legal standing. The likelihood of success of renewed banning attempts has been questioned, given the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has over 130 informants in the party, some in high positions, raising the question of whether the party is effectively controlled by the government.

====2012 Thor Steinar clothing controversy====
In June 2012, several NPD members of Saxony&#x27;s parliament attended the parliament&#x27;s sittings wearing clothing from Thor Steinar, a clothing brand that is popular amongst neo-Nazis; the legislature responded by saying that such provocative clothing was not permitted to be worn in the parliament and demanded that the NPD&#x27;s members remove and replace their attire; the NPD&#x27;s members refused, resulting in the members being expelled from the parliament and banned from attending the next three parliamentary sittings. The NPD members denied accusations that they wore the shirts as a deliberate provocation.

====2012 banning attempt====
German officials tried to outlaw the party again in December 2012, with the interior ministers of all 16 states recommending a ban. The Federal Constitutional Court is yet to vote on the recommendation. In March 2013 the Merkel government said it would not try to ban the NPD.

====2016 banning attempt====
German officials again tried to outlaw the NPD by submitting a request to the Federal Constitutional Court in 2016.

On 17 January 2017, the second senate of the Federal Constitutional Court rejected the attempt to outlaw the party. The reasoning behind the decision was that the NPD&#x27;s political significance is virtually nonexistent at both the state and federal levels and that as such, the party had no chance of posing a significant threat to the constitutional order. It was also reasoned that outlawing the party would not change the mindset and political ideology of its members and supporters, who in the event of a ban could simply form a new movement under a different name.
However, the Court also openly acknowledged that NPD is unconstitutional based on its manifesto and ideology, citing &quot;links to neo-Nazism&quot; and that &quot;anti-semitism was a structural element of the party ideology&quot; in its reasoning. The Court also indirectly suggested that state grants or other financial contributions should not be given to such parties to further their unconstitutional cause. This prompted calls by the public for the proposal of a constitutional amendment which would forbid unconstitutional parties&#x27; financing to the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. The proposal was criticized by the interior policy spokesman of Die Linke, who claimed that such a constitutional amendment could stand to serve as a politically dubious way to remove a political opponent. Constitutional law professor warned that such a constitutional amendment would apply to all extra-parliamentary parties, not just the NPD.

The German legislative bodies then created the possibility of a funding freeze for parties after the second NPD ban procedure failed in 2017. In 2019, the Bundestag, Bundesrat and federal government jointly submitted a proposal to exclude the NPD from state funding. In January 2024 the Federal Constitutional Court allowed the freezing of state funding for six years, saying that the party &quot;aimed to undermine or eliminate the country’s democratic system&quot;.

The German Federal Constitutional Court, in its verdict, considered the party&#x27;s demand for a referendum on the reintroduction of capital punishment as anti-constitutional and incompatible with the liberal democratic basic order.

===2023 renaming to &quot;Die Heimat&quot;===
The party renamed itself to (&quot;The Homeland&quot;) at the party congress in Riesa in early June 2023. 77% voted in favor of the name change.

==Platform and ideology==

The Homeland is a neo-Nazi political party. It calls itself a party of &quot;grandparents and grandchildren&quot; because the 1960s generation in Germany, known for the leftist student movement, strongly opposes the NPD&#x27;s policies. The NPD&#x27;s economic program promotes social security for Germans and control against plutocracy. They discredit and reject the &quot;liberal-capitalist system&quot;.

The Homeland argues that NATO fails to represent the interests and needs of European people. The party considers the European Union to be little more than a reorganization of a Soviet-style government of Europe along financial lines. Although highly critical of the EU, as long as Germany remains a part of it, The Homeland opposes Turkey&#x27;s incorporation into the organization. Voigt envisions future collaboration and continued friendly relations with other nationalists and European nationalist parties. The Homeland is strongly anti-Zionist, frequently criticizing the policies and activities of Israel.

The Homeland&#x27;s platform asserts that Germany is larger than the present-day Federal Republic, and calls for a return of German territory lost after World War II, a foreign policy position abandoned by the German government in 1990.

In the early 21st century, long-standing efforts to ban the party were renewed. The 2005 report of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution contains the following description:
The party continues to pursue a &quot;people&#x27;s front&quot; of the nationalists [consisting of] the NPD, DVU, and forces not attached to any party, which is supposed to develop into a base for an encompassing &#x27;German people&#x27;s movement&#x27;. The aggressive agitation of the NPD unabashedly aims towards the abolition of parliamentary democracy and the democratic constitutional state, although the use of violence is currently still officially rejected for tactical reasons. Statements of the NPD document an essential affinity with Nazism; its agitation is racist, antisemitic, homophobic, revisionist, and intends to disparage the democratic and lawful order of the constitution.

== Organization ==

=== Chairmen ===
=== Youth wing ===

 (short: JN; until 13 January 2018 ) is the official youth organization of the party, founded in 1967. According to The Homeland&#x27;s statutes, the JN are an &quot;integral part&quot; of the party.

The JN are committed to the basic program of the party, but represent these points of view much more aggressively, which is evident both during demonstrations and in political style. They are observed by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and classified as right-wing extremists. Their regular publication is called &quot;The Activist&quot;. In this central organ, under the heading &quot;The Federal Leader Has the Word&quot;, they describe themselves as &quot;representatives of the national revolutionary wing within the NPD&quot;. The youth organization criticizes those in The Homeland who have made the &quot;fight for parliaments&quot; the &quot;most important goal&quot;. Instead, &quot;resistance and criticism are appropriate, since these developments run the risk of gradual adjustment and bourgeoisie&quot;. The JN describe themselves as anti-imperialist. Among other things, they call for the withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan, describe Israel as the &quot;enemy of all peoples&quot;, and refer to it as becoming a parasitic state.

The JN maintains active contacts with a network of neo-Nazi organizations across Europe, like the Nordic Resistance Movement whose Finnish independence day march it has attended, along with National Corps of Ukraine, Bulgarian National Union, Serbian Action and others.

=== Women&#x27;s wing ===
In mid-September 2006, &quot;the Homeland&quot; founded a nationwide women&#x27;s organisation, the &quot;Ring Nationaler Frauen&quot; (RNF). The party sub-organisation within &quot;the Homeland&quot; aims to act as a voice for female party members and provide a contact point for women who share nationalist views but are not affiliated with any political party. Since late May 2017, Antje Mentzel has served as the national chairperson of this organization.

=== Associated organizations ===
The Homeland runs its own &quot;security service&quot; (). The group is led by Manfred Börm.

==== Press organ and other party newspapers ====
&quot;The Homeland&quot; has had various newspapers throughout its history. The official press organ was initially the &quot;Deutsche Nachrichten&quot;. After a merger with the &quot;Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung&quot; (DWZ), bought by publisher and &quot;DVU&quot; chairman Gerhard Frey in 1986, it was renamed Deutsche Wochen-Zeitung - &quot;Deutscher Anzeiger&quot;. In 1999, it was merged with the National-Zeitung, also published by Frey. The &quot;National-Zeitung&quot; was discontinued in 2019.

The party&#x27;s current press organ is &quot;Deutsche Stimme&quot;, which has been published since 1976 and currently has a monthly circulation of 10,000. There are also regional and local publications such as &quot;Sachsen-Stimme&quot; and &quot;Zündstoff-Nachrichten&quot;.

=== Finances ===
The NPD&#x27;s party assets were only small. At the end of 2005, property worth around 700,000 euros was offset by a loan, guarantee and credit burden of around one million euros.

==== Shareholdings ====
&quot;The Homeland&quot; holds a 100 per cent stake in &quot;Deutsche Stimme Verlags GmbH&quot; in Riesa. The publishing house, originally based in Bavaria, publishes the party newspaper Deutsche Stimme as its main product.

==== Financial assets ====
The party is dependent on donations due to its low financial reserves. Its income from contributions amounts to only half a million euros and it receives around one million euros from donations and contributions from elected representatives. In 2005, the NPD received seven donations totalling more than 10,000 euros, mainly from its own Members of Parliament.

In late 2006, it was revealed that the German Bundestag administration demanded the return of approximately 870,000 euros in party financing from the party due to the issuance of fraudulent donation receipts in the Thuringia state association after 1996. These irregularities led to higher party financing, with false donations accounting for six percent of the total in 1997 and ten percent in 1998. Consequently, the Bundestag administration deemed the financial reports for these years to be significantly incorrect, leading to the complete recovery of the funding for those years. As a result of this financial crisis, the party dismissed ten of its twelve employees at the federal headquarters. Additionally, reports indicated that much of The Homeland&#x27;s real estate assets were heavily mortgaged, potentially rendering them unusable as collateral for future party financing payments.

=== International connections ===
Voigt has held meetings with various proponents of white nationalism, including David Duke, a US white nationalist, author, politician, and activist. Between 1989 and 1992, the International Third Position began to ally itself with the NPD in Germany and &quot;Forza Nuova&quot; in Italy.

They have been in contact with Youth Defence, the Irish anti-abortion group, since 1996. Justin Barrett, former leader of Youth Defence and former president of the National Party of Ireland, has spoken at their events in Passau in 2000.The Homeland has also links with the Romanian neo-Legionary group Noua Dreaptă.

The party has links with the Alliance for Peace and Freedom a European political alliance since 2015. 
==== Connections with Croatian far right ====
The party also has connections with far-right parties and politicians in Croatia. In 2017, according to Dražen Keleminec, president of the marginal far-right Autochthonous Croatian Party of Rights (A-HSP), NPD party member Alexander Neidlein took part in the party&#x27;s march to show their support and declare allegiance to then-recently elected American president Donald Trump. During the march, the party&#x27;s members, dressed in black uniforms, waved NPD and American flags while shouting the Ustasha salute . The following day, the U.S. embassy in Zagreb reacted by publishing a statement in which they strongly condemned the march and rejected any attempts to connect the United States with Ustasha ideology.

In 2018, Croatian far-right MP Željko Glasnović took part in the NPD party congress in the town of Büdingen, and expressed his support for the party.

<text>William Sturgeon (; 22 May 1783 – 4 December 1850) was an English electrical engineer and inventor who made the first electromagnet and the first practical electric motor.

==Early life ==
Sturgeon was born on 22 May 1783 in Whittington, near Carnforth, Lancashire, and became apprenticed to a shoemaker.

==Career==
Sturgeon joined the army in 1802 and taught himself mathematics and physics. In 1824 he became lecturer in Science and Philosophy at the East India Company&#x27;s Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey, and in the following year he exhibited his first electromagnet. He displayed its power by lifting nine pounds with a seven-ounce piece of iron wrapped with wire through which a current from a single battery was sent.

In 1832 he was appointed to the lecturing staff of the Adelaide Gallery of Practical Science in London, where he first demonstrated the DC electric motor incorporating a commutator.

In 1836 he established the journal &quot;Annals of Electricity, Magnetism and Chemistry&quot;, and in the same year he invented a galvanometer.

Sturgeon was a close associate of John Peter Gassiot and Charles Vincent Walker, and the three were instrumental in founding the London Electrical Society in 1837.

In 1840 he became superintendent of the Royal Victoria Gallery of Practical Science in Manchester. He formed a close social circle with John Davies, one of the Gallery&#x27;s promoters, and Davies&#x27;s student James Prescott Joule, a circle that eventually extended to include Edward William Binney and the surgeon John Leigh. The Gallery closed in 1842, and he earned a living by lecturing and demonstrating.

In 1843 he started the monthly journal, &quot;The Annals of Philosophical Discovery and Monthly Reporter of the Progress of Practical Science&quot;; issue 1 of volume 1 is dated July 1843. Each month&#x27;s issue contains a mixture of original &quot;long&quot; papers (over 5 pages long), republished papers from foreign journals (translated where necessary) and shorter articles. However, the journal did not prove successful, and ceased publication at the end of volume 1, in December 1843. This single volume is archived at Internet.org.

==Death and burial==
Sturgeon died in Prestwich, Lancashire (now in Greater Manchester) on 4 December 1850. He is buried there, in the churchyard of the St Mary the Virgin: he is identified on his grave slab as &quot;William Sturgeon – The Electrician&quot;.

<text>Quarantine is a 1992 hard science fiction novel by Greg Egan.
Within a detective fiction framework, the novel explores the consequences of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (or rather of its consciousness causes collapse variant), which Egan acknowledges was chosen more for its entertainment value than for its likelihood of being correct.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in the near future (2034–2080), after the Solar System has been surrounded by an impenetrable shield known as the Bubble, presumably by an extraterrestrial civilization for unknown reasons. The Bubble permits no light to enter the Solar System, and as a consequence the stars can no longer be seen, causing widespread societal panic, &#x27;claustrophobia&#x27;, and terrorist action. Neural mods are commonplace, designed pathways in the brain that are created with engineered, programmable microorganisms to produce a variety of effects, such as implanting skillsets, emotions, altered states of awareness or, illegally, forcing and controlling thoughts.

The narrator, Nick, contains a suite of tactical mods that allow him to suppress emotions and enhance tactical and analytical thought. Nick is a private eye forced to quit the police force after the death of his wife, the trauma of which caused him to activate his emotional suppression mod, which further prompted him to purchase a mod that simulates the feeling of love and wellbeing of his wife still being alive, logically solving the problem of grief.

Nick accepts a case to investigate Laura, a woman who has vanished from a psychiatric institute, after several instances of her escaping. The institute staff insist that short of walking through a wall, it should not have been possible to escape the previous times, though it comes to light that she was kidnapped in this instance.

Investigation in New Hong Kong leads Nick to the group responsible, the Ensemble, but causes him to be captured. Nick is implanted with an illegal &#x27;Loyalty Mod&#x27;, which causes him to earnestly and truly believe in the goals of the Ensemble. Nick is used as a security guard for the project the Ensemble is working on, a new neural mod perfected by studying Laura. This mod, called the Eigenstate Mod or &#x27;Eigenmod&#x27;, allows the brain to consciously control the physical process that is responsible for wave function collapse. This feature of neurology is present in several animal species, and one of the researchers responsible for the mod, Po-kwai, suspects that the Bubble may exist because humanity may have been aggressively collapsing the wave functions of alien civilizations that did not have the ability to do so, causing them harm. When using the mod, the user becomes &#x27;Smeared&#x27;, existing within a superposition of states constantly, therefore every possible set of actions they take being equally &#x27;real&#x27;. When one version of the user succeeds in whatever they want to do, they deactivate the mod, collapsing the eigenstates into that one subjective reality. This allows the mod to seemingly control probability to do anything, though raises questions of morality and philosophy to the narrator, who considers deactivating the mod equivalent to murdering the other equally real versions of the user.

Nick eventually meets a group of Ensemble members who like him are under the control of the Loyalty mod. They explain to him that the loyalty mod only specifies their loyalty to the Ensemble, but fails to specify what the Ensemble actually is. Therefore, via logical argument, the group (calling itself the Canon) decides that as by definition the most loyal members of the Ensemble, what the Ensemble is is up to their personal interpretations.

The Canon has Nick steal and apply the eigenstate mod to himself, which he uses for various purposes before eventually meeting with a strangely coherent Laura after bypassing otherwise impregnable security with the mod. Laura explains that she is naturally capable of smearing, and that she is one of the aliens who created the Bubble. The true alien consists of an emergent being composed of all the eigenstates of Laura at once, that dies when she stops smearing, but captures a holographic representation of itself within her mind that rebuilds the alien mind when she begins smearing again. Laura explains that life on earth developed the ability to collapse wave functions by chance, which eventually spread via pure natural selection. As smeared intelligence cannot survive in a single, unique state of the universe, they erected the bubble, preventing humanity from seeing and thus deciding the state of anything outside it, while simultaneously protecting humanity from the starkly alien nature of outside reality. Laura finishes by explaining her role as an observer, there to offer humanity a way to join the rest of the universe, if they choose to. She also warns Nick of his Smeared self, which she describes as a child and unsure of its abilities, but which is becoming increasingly aware that its goals do not align with that of Nick&#x27;s, who she describes as a single cell to a much larger, complex and much more alien Smeared Nick.

A member of the canon uses the stolen eigenstate mod to cheat the production of engineered microbes that can install the mod into people, while also acting and spreading like a disease would, so that he may spread the ability to smear to humanity and join the aliens in smeared reality. Nick attempts to stop the release of the plague but is unsuccessful. Not long after, New Hong Kong begins to be filled with strange and impossible events, people changing faces, turning to glass or vanishing while holograms become real and the sky begins to rain blood. Nick finds Po-kwai, and both affirm that while they are not precisely scared of what is coming, they are not ready for such an existence. Po-kwai postulates that this outcome was inevitable and not the fault of smeared Nick—that instead the smeared total of all of humanity tunneled into possibility. Humans around them begin to blur as the smeared minds begin to increase in complexity. Both watch as stars begin to appear in the sky until it is filled with blinding white light.

In the epilogue, Nick resides in a refugee camp outside of New Hong Kong, the disease apparently only spreading within the city before stopping, but not before causing massive damage and leaving millions dead, often in gruesome and fantastical ways. The only difference for Nick being that his Loyalty mod and the mod simulating love for his wife have been permanently removed, with Nick finding the idea of embracing artificial satisfaction disgusting despite his newfound grief. It is left unclear if the Bubble still exists. Nick and Po-kwai part ways, confused as to why smeared humanity, after going through the trouble of coming to exist, would interact with reality outside the bubble and recoil. Nick initially believes that smeared humanity found the world outside the bubble distasteful, causing them to suicide into a single unique eigenstate again. He begins to suspect though that humanity has in fact smeared and joined the universe, and that he is merely one possibility out of infinite miracles and infinite suffering, his perceived reality being but one tiny aspect of his emergent, smeared self. Nick tries to come to terms with this, lying awake at night contemplating it till he finally falls asleep.

==Publication history==
After the novel&#x27;s initial publication in Australian in 1992 by Legend, it was reprinted as follows:

* 1995, HarperPrism, USA
* 1999, Millenium, UK
* 2008 Gollancz, UK

The novel was also translated into German in 1993, Romanian in 1996, Russian in 1997, Hungarian and Italian in 1998, Spanish and Japanese in 1999, French in 2000, Czech, Hebrew and Lithuanian in 2002, and Polish in 2006.

==Critical reception==
In &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; Van Ikin called it the &quot;fastest-moving Australian sf novel yet&quot;, and continued: &quot;And as a work of literature? Controversy! Traditional humanism might find &quot;Quarantine&quot; hollow and soulless claiming that it merrily surrenders to the allure of glamorous gadgetry ... but the novel counter-answers (somewhat glibly) that life has
never amounted to much and it matters little whether you place your trust in cherished values or the latest mod program So you can place Egan as a future-wise Robbe-Grillet or a spectacle-conscious Spielberg...&quot;

Writing in &quot;SF Commentary&quot; Colin Steele noted: &quot;Where the problem resides is with the overall structure. Egan&#x27;s longer second half almost needs a knowledge of quantum mechanics in order to follow its metaphysical explanations and conjectures. A denouement that is almost of Ballardian (J. G.) hallucinatory dimensions adds up to a work of staggering imagination but flawed incompleteness. Once Egan harnesses the tight ness of his award-winning short stories to the novel structure, there will be few to equal him in the realms of imaginative fiction.&quot;

<text>Naoise O&#x27;Haughan (), also known as Neesy, Ness and Nessie (–1720) was a highwayman from Skerry in the valley of the Braid river in County Antrim, Ireland in the early 18th century. He was the eldest of three sons, having two brothers called Shane and Denis.

Although his father originally came from a well-off Catholic farming family, the penal laws introduced during the Protestant Ascendency forbade Catholic ownership of land and so were forced to rent a smaller patch of land near Slemish where they struggled to survive.

During his family&#x27;s eviction one year, O&#x27;Haughan killed his landlord with an axe and became a fugitive and formed an outlaw gang. The wild rolling hills of Antrim - Divis and Black Mountain - provided an ideal environment for O&#x27;Haughan. He is said to have hidden in caves at the Hatchet Field on the Black Mountain West of Belfast, before he was captured and hanged at &#x27;The Three Sisters&#x27;, the gallows green, near Carrickfergus Castle in 1720.

<doc id="424684" wikidata="Q4431763" url="?curid=424684" title="List of aviation shootdowns and accidents during the Iraq War">
<text>This list of aviation shootdowns and accidents during the Iraq War includes incidents with Coalition and civilian aircraft during the Iraq War.

According to media reports, 129 helicopters and 24 fixed-wing aircraft were lost in Iraq between the 2003 invasion and February 2009. Of these incidents, 46 have been attributed to hostile fire, such as anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. In March 2007, Brig. Gen. Stephen Mundt said that 130 helicopters had been lost in both Iraq and Afghanistan, about a third to hostile fire, and he was concerned that they were not being replaced fast enough. A report published in &quot;Aircraft Survivability&quot; in Summer 2010 gave a total of 375 U.S. helicopters lost in Iraq and Afghanistan up to 2009. Of these, 70 were downed by hostile fire, while the other 305 losses have been classified as non-hostile or non-combat events.

No unmanned aircraft of any type are included in the list below.

At least 283 people have died in helicopter crashes since the invasion, and 19 in fixed-wing crashes.

Since the beginning of the invasion helicopters were the target of attacks with &quot;aerial improvised explosive devices&quot; or home-made bombs. In early 2007, the U.S. Army announced that the Iraqi insurgent groups had developed a strategy for attacking American helicopters. This was confirmed by documents captured from Iraqi insurgents. U.S. deputy commanding general Jim Simmons said that the average month in 2006 and 2007 saw about 17 attacks against helicopters. Efforts to reduce losses included more training for helicopter pilots and improvements in tactics and aircraft defenses. In the fall of 2007, the U.S. military deployed the more advanced V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft. According to the U.S. military, this aircraft flies much higher and faster than helicopters and has six to seven times more survivability than the widely used CH-46.

<text>Jean Anne Carnahan (née Carpenter; December 20, 1933 – January 30, 2024) was an American politician and writer who was the First Lady of Missouri from 1993 to 2000, and served as the state&#x27;s junior United States senator from 2001 to 2002. A Democrat, she was appointed to fill the Senate seat of her husband Mel Carnahan, who had been posthumously elected after his death in October, becoming the first woman to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate.

==Early life==
Jean Anne Carpenter was born on December 20, 1933, in Washington, D.C., to a working-class family; her father was a plumber and her mother a hairdresser. She and her future husband, Mel, both went to Anacostia High School, where they sat next to each other in class. Jean worked through the year while attending George Washington University. She graduated in 1955 with a degree in Business and Public Administration, the first in her family to graduate from high school and college. She was an alumna of Kappa Delta sorority.

Jean and Mel married on June 12, 1954. Two years later, they moved to his home state of Missouri. They settled in Rolla, where Mel opened a law practice, in 1959.

==Career==
As her husband entered politics, she became his political partner, taking an active role writing his speeches and helping run all 20 of his campaigns. She was also active in her own right, leading petition drives for mental health and school bonds in Rolla.

=== First Lady of Missouri ===
Her husband was elected Governor of Missouri, serving from 1993 to 2000. She was an activist First Lady: an advocate for on-site daycare centers for working families, childhood immunization, abuse centers, the arts, and Habitat for Humanity. She also made a priority of restoring the Governor&#x27;s mansion to make it more open to the public. She raised about $1.5 million in funds to restore the mansion, including a new fireplace, cleaning up the basement for more space, and adding a fountain with a sculpture of three children. During her tenure she wrote two books about Missouri history, including &quot;If Walls Could Talk: The Story of Missouri&#x27;s First Families&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Christmas at the Mansion&quot; in 1999. She also wrote &quot;Will You Say a Few Words? ,&quot; a compilation of speeches she gave, in 2000. Some of the earnings from the books went towards renovations in the Governor&#x27;s mansion.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 2000, Governor Carnahan ran for a Senate seat from Missouri against incumbent Republican John Ashcroft in a hotly contested battle, in which Senate control was on the line. Three weeks before election day, the governor was killed in an airplane crash, along with their son Randy (who piloted the plane) and Chris Sifford, the governor&#x27;s chief of staff and campaign advisor. Due to the short amount of time before the election, Missouri election law did not allow his name to be removed from the ballot. Newly inaugurated Governor Roger Wilson announced that he would appoint Jean Carnahan if her husband were to posthumously win the election, making her effectively the Democratic candidate by proxy.

Jean Carnahan initially was unsure whether she was up for running for the seat. But as she saw an outpouring of support from Missouri voters, and wanting to continue her husband&#x27;s work, Carnahan announced her intent to accept Wilson&#x27;s appointment. She refrained from running an extensive campaign, making only one advertisement, and making just one TV news appearance. In the end, Mel Carnahan posthumously won (51%–48%), receiving 1.19 million votes out of 2.36 million cast. Jean Carnahan was appointed to the Senate in 2001, but under Missouri law, she would serve only until a special election could be held in 2002.

==== Tenure ====

Upon her swearing in, Carnahan became the first woman to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate. The defeated Ashcroft was subsequently nominated by President George W. Bush to be the United States Attorney General. Carnahan had offered praise to him and opposed a proposed effort to filibuster his nomination, but ultimately voted against Ashcroft&#x27;s nomination. Carnahan called her vote an &#x27;act of conscience&#x27; but the vote opened her up to criticism from Republicans, who had previously showed restraint owing to the circumstances of her appointment.

Carnahan also took a lead on other issues. She supported the merger between Trans World Airlines, who had 12,000 employees in St. Louis, and American Airlines, calling it a &quot;rescue mission&quot; and persuaded fellow senators to not intervene. She also sponsored legislation to provide economic benefits and health care for laid off airline workers post-9/11. She voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts.

In 2002, the special election was held for the remainder of the six-year term. Carnahan formally announced her campaign April 28, 2002, and entered as one of the most vulnerable incumbents up that cycle. She was defeated in a close race by Republican Jim Talent; the margin was only 22,000 votes (49.8–48.6%).

== Family and later life ==
In 2004, Carnahan&#x27;s son, Russ Carnahan, was elected to Congress, and her daughter Robin Carnahan was elected Missouri Secretary of State. Robin&#x27;s bid to follow her mother as a United States senator failed, however, when she was defeated by Republican U.S. Representative Roy Blunt in the 2010 election to succeed retiring Republican Senator Kit Bond. Russ Carnahan lost his House seat in the 2012 elections after his district was eliminated, forcing him to run in a Democratic primary against fellow incumbent Lacy Clay, whose district encompassing inner-city St. Louis was kept largely intact.

After losing her Senate race, Carnahan continued as an activist and author. She wrote six books and numerous opinion pieces. The title of her 2004 book is a phrase used during the 2000 campaign to elect her husband to the Senate after his death, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Fire Go Out&quot;.

Carnahan died at a hospice facility in Creve Coeur, Missouri, on January 30, 2024, at the age of 90.

<doc id="424687" wikidata="Q12058464" url="?curid=424687" title="The George Inn, Southwark">
<text>The George Inn, or The George, is a public house established in the medieval period on Borough High Street in Southwark, London, owned and leased by the National Trust. It is located about from the south side of the River Thames near London Bridge and is the only surviving galleried London coaching inn.

==History==

The pub was formerly known as the George and Dragon, named after the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. It is possible that it was used for Elizabethan theatrical productions (Inn-yard theatre), as other galleried inns were.

A pub has existed on the site since medieval times. In 1677, it was rebuilt after a serious fire destroyed most of Southwark. The medieval pub was situated next door to The Tabard Inn where Chaucer set the beginning of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

Later, the Great Northern Railway used the George as a depot and pulled down two of its fronts to build warehousing. Now just the south face remains.

Charles Dickens visited The George, and referred to it in both &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;.

==Description==
The building is partly timber framed.
The ground floor is divided into a number of connected bars. The Parliament Bar used to be a waiting room for passengers on coaches. The Middle Bar was the Coffee Room, which was frequented by Charles Dickens. The bedrooms, now a restaurant, were upstairs in the galleried part of the building.

It is the only surviving galleried coaching inn in London. The White Hart was immediately to the north but was demolished in the nineteenth century. Immediately to the south was The Tabard (which was described in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;); it too was demolished in the nineteenth century.

The building is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and is listed in the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.

<doc id="424689" wikidata="Q738947" url="?curid=424689" title="Estonian Reform Party">
<text>The Estonian Reform Party () is a liberal political party in Estonia. The party has been led by Kristen Michal since 2024. It is colloquially known as the &quot;Squirrel Party&quot; () or as &quot;the Squirrels&quot; (), referencing its logo.

It was founded in 1994 by Siim Kallas, then-president of the Bank of Estonia, as a split from Pro Patria National Coalition Party. As the Reform Party has participated in most of the government coalitions in Estonia since the mid-1990s, its influence has been significant, especially regarding Estonia&#x27;s free market and policies of low taxation. The party has been a full member of Liberal International since 1996, having been an observer member between 1994 and 1996, and a full member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Reform Party leaders Siim Kallas, Taavi Rõivas, Andrus Ansip and Kaja Kallas have all served as prime ministers of Estonia. From 17 April 2023, the party has been the senior member in a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party and Estonia 200.

== History ==
The Estonian Reform Party was founded on 18 November 1994, joining together the Reform Party – a splinter from the Pro Patria National Coalition (RKEI) – and the Estonian Liberal Democratic Party (ELDP). The new party, which had 710 members at its foundation, was led by Siim Kallas, who had been president of the Bank of Estonia. Kallas was not viewed as being associated with Mart Laar&#x27;s government and was generally considered a proficient central bank governor, having overseen the successful introduction of the Estonian kroon. The party formed ties with the Free Democratic Party of Germany, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party of Sweden, the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland, and Latvian Way.

=== Siim Kallas ===

Siim Kallas was leader of the Reform Party from 1994 to 2004. He was Prime Minister of Estonia from 2002 to 2003. In the party&#x27;s first parliamentary election in March 1995, it won 19 seats, catapulting it into second place, behind the Coalition Party. Tiit Vähi tried to negotiate a coalition with the Reform Party, but the talks broke down over economic policy, with the Reform Party opposing agricultural subsidies and supporting the maintenance of Estonia&#x27;s flat-rate income tax. While the Coalition Party formed a new government with the Centre Party at first, a taping scandal involving Centre Party leader Edgar Savisaar led to the Reform Party replacing the Centre Party in the coalition in November 1995. Kallas was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, with five other Reform Party members serving in the cabinet. The Reform Party left the government in November 1996 after the Coalition Party signed a cooperation agreement with the Centre Party without consulting them.

At the 1999 election, the Reform Party dropped one seat to 18, finishing third behind the Centre Party and the conservative Pro Patria Union. The ER formed a centre-right coalition with the Pro Patria Union and the Moderates, with Mart Laar as Prime Minister and Siim Kallas as Minister of Finance, and with Toomas Savi returned as Speaker. Although the coalition was focused on EU and NATO accession, the Reform Party successfully delivered its manifesto pledge to abolish the corporate tax, one of its most notable achievements. After the October 1999 municipal elections, the three parties replicated their alliance in Tallinn.

The party served in government again from March 1999 to December 2001 in a tripartite government with Pro Patria Union and People&#x27;s Party Moderates, from January 2002 to March 2003 with the Estonian Centre Party, from March 2003 to March 2005 with Res Publica and People&#x27;s Union, from March 2005 to March 2007 with the Centre Party and People&#x27;s Union, from March 2007 to May 2009 with the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union and the Social Democratic Party. From May 2009 the Reform Party was in a coalition government with the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union.

=== Andrus Ansip ===

Andrus Ansip was Prime Minister of Estonia from April 2005 to March 2014. After the 2007 parliamentary election the party held 31 out of 101 seats in the Riigikogu, receiving 153,040 votes (28% of the total), an increase of +10%, resulting in a net gain of 12 seats.

=== Taavi Rõivas ===
Following the resignation of Andrus Ansip, a new cabinet was installed on 24 March 2014, with Taavi Rõivas of the Reform Party serving as Prime Minister in coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SDE).

In the 2014 European elections held on 25 May 2014, the Reform Party won 24.3% of the national vote, returning two MEPs.

In the 2015 parliamentary election held on 1 March 2015, the Reform Party received 27.7% of the vote and 30 seats in the Riigikogu. It went on to form a coalition with Social Democratic Party and Pro Patria and Res Publica Union. In November 2016, the coalition split because of internal struggle. After coalition talks, a new coalition was formed between Center Party, SDE and IRL, while Reform Party was left in the opposition for the first time since 1999. Rõivas subsequently stepped down as the chairman of the party.

=== Hanno Pevkur ===
On 7 January 2017, Hanno Pevkur was elected the new chairman of the Reform Party. Pevkur&#x27;s leadership was divided from the start and he faced increasing criticism till the end of the year. On 13 December 2017, Pevkur announced that he would not run for the chairmanship from January 2018.

=== Kaja Kallas ===

Kaja Kallas was elected party leader on 14 April 2018.

Under Kallas&#x27; leadership during the 2019 election, the Reform Party achieved its best electoral result to date with 28.8% of the vote and 34 seats, although it initially did not form a government and remained in opposition to the second Ratas government.

In January 2021, after the resignation of Jüri Ratas as Prime Minister, Kallas formed a Reform Party-led coalition government with the Estonian Centre Party. However, on 3 June 2022, Kallas dismissed the seven ministers affiliated with the Centre Party, governing as a minority government until a new coalition government with Isamaa and SDE as minority partners was formed on 8 July.

In the 2023 parliamentary election, the Reform Party improved on its 2019 electoral performance, with 31.2% of the vote 37 seats. On 7 March 2023, the party initiated coalition negotiations with the new Estonia 200 party and the SDE. A coalition agreement between the three parties was reached by 7 April, allocating seven ministerial seats for the Reform Party, and was officially signed on 10 April. On 17 April, the third Kallas government was sworn into office.

In July 2024, Kristen Michal became Estonia’s new prime minister to succeed Kaja Kallas, who resigned as prime minister on July 15 to become the European Union’s new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

== Ideology and platform ==
Described as being on the centre, centre-right, or right-wing of the political spectrum, the Estonian Reform Party has variously been described in its ideological orientation as liberal, classical-liberal, liberal-conservative, and conservative-liberal. The party has consistently advocated policies of economic liberalism and fiscal conservatism, and has also been described as neoliberal.

* The party supports Estonian 0% corporate tax on re-invested income and wants to eliminate the dividend tax.
* The party wanted to cut flat income tax rate from 22% (in 2007) to 18% by 2011. Because of the economic crisis, the campaign for cutting income tax rate was put on hold with the tax rate at 21% in 2008 and 2009.
* The party used to oppose VAT general rate increases until late spring 2009, when it changed its position in the light of the dire economic crisis and the need to find more money for the budget. VAT was increased from 18% to 20% on 1 July 2009.

== Political support ==
The party is supported predominantly by young, well-educated, urban professionals. The Reform Party&#x27;s vote base is heavily focused in the cities; although it receives only one-fifth of its support from Tallinn, it receives three times as many votes from other cities, despite them being home to fewer than 40% more voters overall.

Its voter profile is significantly younger than average, while its voters are well-educated, with the fewest high school drop-outs of any party. Its membership is the most male-dominated of all the parties, yet it receives the support of more female voters than average. Reform Party voters also tend to have higher incomes, with 43% of Reform Party voters coming from the top 30% of all voters by income.

== Organisation ==

The Reform Party has been a full member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (formerly the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, ELDR) since December 1998. In the European Parliament, the party&#x27;s MEPS Andrus Ansip and Urmas Paetsits in the ALDE group in the Assembly. The Reform Party has been a full member of the Liberal International since 1996, having been an observer member from 1994 to 1996.

The party claims to have 12,000 members.

The party&#x27;s youth wing is the Estonian Reform Party Youth, which includes members aged 15 to 35. The organisation claims to have 4,500 members, and its chairman is Doris Lisett Rudnevs.

<text>Res Publica Party () was a political party in Estonia that self-identified as conservative. Established as a party on 8 December 2001, the political organisation Res Publica was founded already as early as 1989 and existed as a community of young conservatives, mostly associated with the Pro Patria Union party during the 1990s. Res Publica was a member of the EPP (European People&#x27;s Party) on the European level. It merged with Pro Patria Union in 2006 to form the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union.

The party was founded under the name Union for the Republic – Res Publica (&quot;Ühendus vabariigi eest – Res Publica&quot;), but was commonly referred to as simply Res Publica and changed its name to Res Publica Party.

The party won its first parliamentary elections (in 2003) after being established. Their election slogans were &quot;Vote for new politics&quot; (&quot;Vali uus poliitika&quot;) and &quot;Choose order&quot; (&quot;Vali kord&quot;). They formed a coalition with the Reform Party and the People&#x27;s Union. The coalition broke in 2005 as a result of opposition to the policies of Res Publica&#x27;s minister of justice Vaher.

At the time of its merging with Pro Patria, it was led by Taavi Veskimägi, a former Minister of Finance. The previous chairman Juhan Parts was also Prime Minister from 10 April 2003 until 23 March 2005. Until the 2007 parliamentary elections, Res Publica was the largest party in the Riigikogu, with 28 of 101 seats.

On 4 April 2006, representatives of the Pro Patria Union and the representatives of Res Publica decided to merge the two parties. A decision was made to form a new party, named Pro Patria and Res Publica Union (&quot;Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit&quot;), after approval by general assemblies of both merging political forces. Approval was given by the general assemblies on 4 June 2006. The union took third place in the 2007 elections, which, though they resulted in a loss in the combined parties&#x27; strength in Parliament, was a stronger than expected showing.

<text>&quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; (Roud 533) is an Irish traditional song set in the southern mountains of Ireland, often with specific mention of counties Cork and Kerry. The song, about a rapparee (highwayman) who is betrayed by his wife or lover, is one of the most widely performed traditional Irish songs and has been recorded by numerous artists since the 1950s.

The song first gained wide exposure when Irish folk band the Dubliners performed it internationally as a signature song, and recorded it on three albums in the 1960s. In the U.S., the song was popularised by the Highwaymen, who recorded it on their 1962 album &quot;Encore&quot;. Irish rock band Thin Lizzy hit the Irish and British pop charts with the song in 1973. In 1990, the Dubliners re-recorded the song with the Pogues with a faster rocky version charting at No. 63 in the UK. American metal band Metallica in 1998 played a version very similar to that of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s, though with a heavier sound, winning a Grammy for the song in 2000 for Best Hard Rock Performance.

==Story==
&quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; is the tale of a highwayman or footpad who, after robbing a military or government official, is betrayed by a woman; whether she is his wife or sweetheart is not made clear. Various versions of the song take place in Kerry, Kilmoganny, Cork, Sligo Town, and other locations throughout Ireland. It is also sometimes placed in the American South, in various places among the Ozarks or Appalachians, possibly due to Irish settlement in these places. Names in the song change, and the official can be a Captain or a Colonel, called Farrell or Pepper among other names. The protagonist&#x27;s wife or lover is sometimes called Molly, Jenny, Emzy, or Ginny among various other names. The details of the betrayal are also different, being either betraying him to the person he robbed and replacing his ammunition with sand or water, or not, resulting in his killing the person.

==History==
The song&#x27;s exact origins are unknown. A number of its lines and the general plot resemble those of a contemporary broadside ballad &quot;Patrick Fleming&quot; (also called &quot;Patrick Flemmen he was a Valiant Soldier&quot;) about Irish highwayman Patrick Fleming, who was executed in 1650.

In the book &quot;The Folk Songs of North America&quot;, folk music historian Alan Lomax suggests that the song originated in the 17th century, and (based on plot similarities) that John Gay&#x27;s 1728 &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was inspired by Gay hearing an Irish ballad-monger singing &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;. In regard to the history of the song, Lomax states, &quot;The folk of seventeenth century Britain liked and admired their local highwaymen; and in Ireland (or Scotland) where the gentlemen of the roads robbed English landlords, they were regarded as national patriots. Such feelings inspired this rollicking ballad.&quot;

At some point, the song came to the United States and was a favourite in Colonial America because of its irreverent attitude toward British officials. The American versions are sometimes set in America and deal with American characters. One such version, from Massachusetts, is about Alan McCollister, an Irish-American soldier who is sentenced to death by hanging for robbing British officials.

The song appeared in a form close to its modern version in a precursor called &quot;The Sporting Hero, or, Whiskey in the Bar&quot; in a mid-1850s broadsheet.

The song collector Colm Ó Lochlainn, in his book &quot;Irish Street Ballads&quot;, described how his mother learnt &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; in Limerick in 1870 from a man called Buckley who came from Cork. When Ó Lochlainn included the song in &quot;Irish Street Ballads&quot;, he wrote down the lyrics from memory as he had learnt them from his mother. He called the song &quot;There&#x27;s Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, and the lyrics are virtually identical to the version that was used by Irish bands in the 1960s such as the Dubliners. The Ó Lochlainn version refers to the &quot;far fam&#x27;d Kerry mountain&quot; rather than the Cork and Kerry mountains, as appears in some versions.

The song also appears under the title &quot;There&#x27;s Whiskey in the Jar&quot; in the Joyce collection, but that only includes the melody line without any lyrics. Versions of the song were collected in the 1920s in Northern Ireland by song collector Sam Henry. It is Roud Folk Song Index no. 533.

==Variations==


&quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; is sung with many variants on locations and names, including a version by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead with mandolinist David Grisman; a version by the Dubliners (which is often sung in Irish traditional music sessions around the world); a rock version sung by Thin Lizzy; and a heavy metal version (inspired by Thin Lizzy&#x27;s performance of the song) by Metallica.

There is also a song about Irish troops in the American Civil War called &quot;We&#x27;ll Fight for Uncle Sam&quot;, which is sung in the same tune of &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;.

<text>The Burjanadze-Democrats was an election bloc in the republic of Georgia founded in 2003. It played important role in the 2003 Rose Revolution. It was led by Zurab Zhvania and Nino Burjanadze. Other famous members of this bloc included Gigi Tsereteli and Eldar Shengelaia. 

==History==
The electoral bloc was created prior to the 2003 Georgian parliamentary election, amidst the chaos and inner struggle within the ruling Union of Citizens of Georgia, which many of its leaders had begun to leave. As such, Zurab Zhvania, one of the leaders of the UCG in the parliament, established his own &#x27;United Democrats&#x27; opposition party on 17 June 2002. He was soon joined by Nino Burjanadze, an independent deputy in the Parliament of Georgia which was elected as the chairperson with the support of rival groupings within the UCG in November 2001. Burjanadze announced her decision to join the opposition on 3 June 2003, during the demonstration against the government of President Eduard Shevardnadze. Zhvania was able to win over quite popular Nino Burjanadze by August 2003. The electoral alliance Burjanadze-Democrats was officially announced on 21 August 2003. The bloc was further boosted when it was joined by the Akaki Asatiani&#x27;s Union of Georgian Traditionalists in September 2003.

In November 2003, the electoral bloc was part of the protests against the results of the 2003 parliamentary election, claiming the fraud. With Mikheil Saakashvili&#x27;s fellow opposition party, the United National Movement, widespread protests were held including a storming of the Parliament building on 22 November 2003, preventing the launch of the first session of the new parliament. The protest was quickly followed by Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s resignation. The United National Movement and the Burjanadze-Democrats formed the bloc National Movement-Democrats (NMD) and secured overwhelming victory in the 2004 Georgian parliamentary election with 67.75% of the vote. Nino Burjanadze was elected to the chairmanship of the parliament, while Zurab Zhvania became the Prime Minister of Georgia. Soon, Zurab Zhvania died in controversial circumstances in his flat in 2005, while Nino Burjanadze announced her withdrawal from the coalition, launching her own party Democratic Movement – United Georgia in 2008.

==Ideology==
The Burjanadze-Democrats has been described as being a moderate political force in comparasion to the United National Movement of Mikheil Saakashvili. The United Democrats has been characterized as professing centrist liberal democratic values, while Burjanadze was marked by her slogan &quot;revolutionary changes without the revolution&quot;. The National Movement and the Burjanadze-Democrats have been described as being &quot;Bolsheviks and Mensheviks of the Rose Revolution&quot;.

The electoral programme of the bloc focused on improving the business environment, reducing bureaucracy, implementing administrative reform, reducing presidential powers, abolishing the presidential appointment of regional governors, introducing two-chamber parliament and a cabinet of minsiters, and launching affirmative action programmes to integrate national minorities. Its main appeal to its voters was the political experience and prudence of its leaders, with the main slogan being &quot;we are not radicals&quot;. The bloc considered as its main voter base to be the intelligentsia and the middle class.

<doc id="424704" wikidata="Q4971332" url="?curid=424704" title="British embossed postage stamps">
<text>The adhesive embossed postage stamps of the United Kingdom, issued during the reign of Queen Victoria between 1847 and 1854 exhibit four features which are unique to this issue:
* The method of production of the dies used for the printing
* The use of silk threaded paper (on two of the values)
* The method of printing (one stamp at a time)
* The use of tinted gum (on the six pence value)

==Issue dates==
Three values of the octagonal stamps were introduced to cover higher foreign and registered postal charges on the following dates:

1 Shilling (green) - 11 September 1847, 10d (brown) - 6 November 1848, 6d (mauve/lilac/purple) - 1 March 1854

The 1 shilling was the first British postage stamp to bear a value above 2d.

==Embossing==
The dies used for this type of printing have the embossed, (raised), portions of the stamp design cut away, (recessed), into the metal. The colourless detail as appears on the hair and diadem are achieved by variations in the depth of the engraving.

==The dies==
The master die was engraved by William Wyon using as his basis the City medal of 1837 which he had also engraved. (This was the same model used for the head engraved on the Penny Black).

The original master die did not show the pendant curl at the back of the hair and was not used in this form on the postage stamps, although it was used at the Royal Mint for coinage.

From this master, a series of sub-dies were made and the curl added to the back of the hair. As such the curl differs on each value. Also added to the dies, after the outer design had been completed, was a die number. This takes the form of a number with the letters W W either before or after and appears at the base of the neck of Queen Victoria.

==Paper==
For the ten pence and one shilling values, Dickinson silk thread paper was used. The threads are blue and are embedded into the paper at the time of manufacture.

The paper used for the six pence value was watermarked with the letters V R which were arranged so that it appeared complete on each impression.

==Tinted gum==
Tinted gum was introduced on the six pence value following a printing which was made in error on the gummed side of the paper. Prior to the introduction of the tinted gum, it was colourless.

==Printing==
The presses used for the embosses dies, allowed for only one stamp to be printed at a time. This method of production meant that the spacing on the sheets varied from wide spacing, (which is uncommon), to very narrow which is why examples with four margins are rare. In some cases the impressions were impressed overlapping each other by quite a large amount.

The stamps were embossed, (printed), at Somerset House. Early collectors would often cut the stamps to shape retaining only the embossed central design and cut square examples are much more valuable.

==Replacement==

In 1856 after the European postage rate was reduced the stamps were replaced by surface printed issues.

<doc id="424709" wikidata="Q1065388" url="?curid=424709" title="Much Hadham">
<text>Much Hadham, formerly known as Great Hadham, is a village and civil parish in the district of East Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire, England. The parish of Much Hadham contains the hamlets of Perry Green and Green Tye, as well as the village of Much Hadham itself and Hadham Cross. It covers . The village of Much Hadham is situated midway between Ware and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. The population of the parish was recorded as 2,087 in the 2011 census, an increase from 1,994 in 2001.

==History==
The name &quot;Hadham&quot; probably derives from Old English words meaning &quot;Heath homestead&quot;. The affix &quot;Much&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;mycel&quot;, meaning &quot;great&quot;. The name changed around the time of the Civil War.

The parish has been occupied since the Roman period. There were pottery kilns in the parish in the Roman period, and a Roman coin hoard has been found nearby.

Written records of Much Hadham go back to the time of King Edgar. The village was a possession of the Bishops of London before the Norman Conquest, and it appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Hadham&quot;. The parish church was built from 1220–1450. The village was a staging point on the road from London to Cambridge and Newmarket, and the Olde Red Lion Inn, built in 15th century to serve this traffic, still survives in the village.

The Bishop&#x27;s Palace was used as an asylum from 1817–1863.

During the First World War, there was a British Red Cross/Order of St. John auxiliary hospital in Much Hadham. Today, a plaque on the front of Woodham House commemorates this.

During the Second World War, Much Hadham was the site of Prisoner of War camp 69. The camp was opened in 1939, housing Italian prisoners of war, and later German prisoners, as well as housing American and Gurkha soldiers as they prepared for the D-Day landings. The camp closed around 1950.

==Geography==
The village is linear stretched along its mile and a half long high street (High Street, Tower Hill and Widford Road) which runs along the river Ash. It is situated between Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Ware, about from Hertford and about north of London. The village had a railway station on the Buntingford single track branch line, which closed in 1965 under the Beeching Axe.

==Landmarks==

There are two church buildings in Much Hadham, the parish church and a Congregational church. Much Hadham&#x27;s parish church, built largely between 1225 and 1450, is shared between the St. Andrew&#x27;s Church of England congregation and the Holy Cross Roman Catholic congregation. The entrance to the church is adorned with two sculptures by Henry Moore. 

Peter Townsend, a noted Battle of Britain pilot later romantically linked to Princess Margaret, married his first wife, Rosemary Pawle, in St. Andrew&#x27;s in 1941.

The more recent Congregational church dates from 1872.

There are many listed buildings in Much Hadham, including four listed at Grade I. These are the St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church, Much Hadham Hall, Moor Place and the boundary wall at Yewtree Farmhouse at Hadham Cross. The Parish&#x27;s many Grade II Star Listed buildings include The Lordship, The Red House, Yew Tree Farmhouse and Much Hadham Palace, the site of a residence of the Bishops of London.

The Henry Moore Foundation can be found in Perry Green, and includes Moore&#x27;s home. In December 2005, thieves stole a 1970 bronze of a reclining figure from the site, which was melted and sold for scrap metal.
The Red Lion coaching inn, now converted into private houses, has been in the village since the 15th century. It was a stopping point on the old road from London to Cambridge. Legend has it that the inn is connected to St. Andrew&#x27;s by a tunnel, possibly built during the time of Oliver Cromwell as an escape route for the clergy. This is highly unlikely given the height of the water table.

==Government==
Much Hadham is a civil parish in the East Hertfordshire District. It is one of thirty wards to make up East Hertfordshire District Council. It is part of the Hertford and Stortford Parliamentary Constituency. 

==Education==

St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England Primary School in Much Hadham is a Church of England school with links to the parish church of St Andrew&#x27;s. It has about 250 pupils between the ages of 4 and 11. The school also has a nursery in the mornings for younger children. A village school has existed in the village since the 1840s. The first now known as the Flint House. A second independent pre prep school in Much Hadham, the Barn School, closed in 1998. There is also a pre-school with about 40 children aged between 2 and 4.

Outside the village of Much Hadham in the hamlet of Perry Green there is St. Elizabeth&#x27;s School and residence for children and young adults with epilepsy, established in 1903, the second largest employer in the District.

Much Hadham has a small museum, The Forge Museum, which contains preserved Elizabethan wall-paintings as well as information about local history. The Henry Moore Foundation in Perry Green houses a large collection of the artist&#x27;s work.

==Sport==
The village has the charitable Sports Association which runs the publicly owned Recreation Ground and facilities. There is an infants&#x27; playground and a newly refurbished sports pavilion completed in 2015, used by the village football team and for social events.

Much Hadham Cricket Club (founded in 1889) withdrew from the Herts &amp; Essex League in 2007 and cricket is now no longer played. The village has a football team and Tennis and Bowls Clubs are open to anyone to join for an annual fee, all on the Recreation Ground.

==Notable residents==
Adjacent to the church is Much Hadham Palace, a country home of the Bishops of London for 800 years. Edmund Tudor, father of Henry VII, may have been born in the Palace. It was sold by the church for the last time in 1888.

*Alexander Nowell, dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, was rector of Much Hadham from 1862, and fished in the river Ash.
*The sculptor Henry Moore lived in Perry Green until his death.
*Charles Fitzroy Doll, architect lived at Hadham Towers.

<text>The Elka 22 was the second Bulgarian electronic calculator produced by ELKA; it was released in 1966 and its serial production began in 1967 in the town of Silistra. Weighing 8.5 kilograms (18.7 pounds), the Elka 22 has 3 registers and operates with 12 decimal digits. Addition speed is 0.3 seconds per operation, and division speed is 0.5 seconds. Its power consumption is 35 watts. This calculator has a plastic case, a nixie tube display and its technology is based on numerous phenol boards populated with hundreds of discrete transistors, diodes and resistors, not unlike other calculator models developed around the mid-1960s. The machine used a magnetic-core memory.

<text>In mathematics, a palindromic prime (sometimes called a palprime) is a prime number that is also a palindromic number. Palindromicity depends on the base of the number system and its notational conventions, while primality is independent of such concerns. The first few decimal palindromic primes are:
:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, … 

Except for 11, all palindromic primes have an odd number of digits, because the divisibility test for 11 tells us that every palindromic number with an even number of digits is a multiple of 11. It is not known if there are infinitely many palindromic primes in base 10. For any base, almost all palindromic numbers are composite, i.e. the ratio between palindromic composites and all palindromes less than &quot;n&quot; tends to 1.

A few decorative examples do however exist; in base 10 the following are primes:&lt;BR&gt;
      11,     122333221,     and   1223334444555554444333221.

So are: 13331, and 12233355555333221.

For a large example, consider:&lt;BR&gt;
:101888529 - 10944264 - 1,
which has 1,888,529 digits. It was found on 18 October 2021 by Ryan Propper and Serge Batalov.

==Other bases==

In binary, the palindromic primes include the Mersenne primes and the Fermat primes. All binary palindromic primes except binary 11 (decimal 3) have an odd number of digits; those palindromes with an even number of digits are divisible by 3. The sequence of binary palindromic primes begins (in binary):
:11, 101, 111, 10001, 11111, 1001001, 1101011, 1111111, 100000001, 100111001, 110111011, ... 

Any number that can be expressed as a repetition of just one digit d in some base must trivially be palindromic in that base and must be a multiple of d in every base. Accordingly, no number that consists only of a string of repetitions of the same digit in at least one base, can be a prime unless it is a string of 1s in that base. Furthermore, the string must be of prime length, otherwise, if the string is of length mXn, it is divisible by strings of lengths m and n in that base. For example 111111111111111 (15 digits) is divisible by 111 and 11111 in that base. If a number m can be expressed as a string of prime length to some base, such a number may or may not be prime, but commonly is not; for example, to base 10, there are only three such numbers of length less than 100 (1 is by definition, not prime). The three are:&lt;BR&gt;          11 (length 2),     1111111111111111111 (length 19),     and     11111111111111111111111 (length 23)

==Property==

Due to the superstitious significance of the numbers it contains, the palindromic prime 1000000000000066600000000000001 is known as Belphegor&#x27;s Prime, named after Belphegor, one of the seven princes of Hell. Belphegor&#x27;s Prime consists of the number 666, on either side enclosed by thirteen zeroes and a one. Belphegor&#x27;s Prime is an example of a beastly palindromic prime in which a prime &quot;p&quot; is palindromic with 666 in the center. Another beastly palindromic prime is 700666007.

Ribenboim defines a triply palindromic prime as a prime &quot;p&quot; for which: &quot;p&quot; is a palindromic prime with &quot;q&quot; digits, where &quot;q&quot; is a palindromic prime with &quot;r&quot; digits, where &quot;r&quot; is also a palindromic prime. For example, &quot;p&quot; = 1011310 + 4661664 + 1, which has &quot;q&quot; = 11311 digits, and 11311 has &quot;r&quot; = 5 digits. The first (base-10) triply palindromic prime is the 11-digit number 10000500001. It is possible that a triply palindromic prime in base 10 may also be palindromic in another base, such as base 2, but it would be highly remarkable if it were also a triply palindromic prime in that base as well.

<doc id="424724" wikidata="Q856371" url="?curid=424724" title="Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls">
<text>The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 at the beginning of the Cold War to coordinate controls on exports from Western Bloc countries to the Soviet Union and its allies. CoCom ceased to function on March 31, 1994, but the control list of embargoed goods was retained by the member nations until the Wassenaar Arrangement was established in 1996.

== Membership ==
In its final years, CoCom had 17 member states:
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*


Despite being neutral, Switzerland joined the CoCom sanctions against the Eastern bloc countries; see .

=== Laws and regulations ===
In the United States, CoCom compliance was implemented by various statutes authorizing the President to regulate exports, including the Export Control Act of 1949, the Export Administration Act of 1969, the Export Administration Act of 1979, the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the Trading with the Enemy Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, among others. Many of these statutes encouraged the coordination of controls with allies. However, throughout the Cold War, the United States maintained controls in excess of those agreed to in CoCom.

The Department of State and the Department of Commerce administered these coordinated controls via the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

==Violations==

Toshiba Machine Company of Japan and Kongsberg Group of Norway supplied eight CNC propeller milling machines to the Soviet Union between 1982 and 1984, an action that violated the CoCom regulations. The United States&#x27; position is that this greatly improved the ability of Soviet submarines to evade detection. Congress moved to sanction Toshiba and ban imports of its products into the United States.

In a related case, French machine tool company Forest-Liné (later acquired by Fives Group) exported several machines, used for fabricating aircraft fuselages and turbine blades for high-performance jet engines. This information came to light during an investigation by the Norwegian police into the Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal.

== Legacy ==

=== GPS ===
In GPS technology, the term &quot;CoCom Limits&quot; also refers to a limit placed on GPS receivers that limits functionality when the device calculates that it is moving faster than and/or at an altitude higher than . This was intended to prevent the use of GPS in intercontinental ballistic missile-like applications.

Some manufacturers apply this limit only when both speed and altitude limits are reached, while other manufacturers disable tracking when either limit is reached. In the latter case, this causes some devices to refuse to operate in very-high-altitude balloons.

The Missile Technology Control Regime&#x27;s Technical Annex, clause 11.A.3, includes a speed limit on GNSS receivers, set at 600 m/s.

<doc id="424725" wikidata="Q1638558" url="?curid=424725" title="Cirsium">
<text>Cirsium is a genus of perennial and biennial flowering plants in the Asteraceae, one of several genera known commonly as thistles. They are more precisely known as plume thistles. These differ from other thistle genera (&quot;Carduus&quot;, &quot;Silybum&quot; and &quot;Onopordum&quot;) in having a seed with a pappus of feathered hairs on their achenes. The other genera have a pappus of simple unbranched hairs.

They are mostly native to Eurasia and northern Africa, with about 60 species from North America (although several species have been introduced outside their native ranges). The lectotype species of the genus is &quot;Cirsium heterophyllum&quot; (L.) Hill.

&quot;Cirsium&quot; thistles are known for their effusive flower heads, usually purple, rose or pink, also yellow or white. The radially symmetrical disc flowers are at the end of the branches and are visited by many kinds of insects, featuring a generalised pollination syndrome. They have erect stems, with a characteristic enlarged base of the flower which is often spiny. The leaves are alternate, spiny in many (but not all) species, and in some species can be slightly to densely hairy. Extensions from the leaf base down the stem, called wings, can be lacking (&quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;), conspicuous (&quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;), or inconspicuous. They can spread by seed, and also by rhizomes below the surface (&quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;). The seeds have a tuft of hair, or pappus, which can carry them far by wind.

&quot;Cirsium&quot; thistles are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species—see list of Lepidoptera that feed on Cirsium. The seeds are attractive to small finches such as American goldfinch.

Many species are considered weeds, typically by agricultural interests. &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot; (spear thistle) is listed in the United States (where as a non-native invasive species it has been renamed &quot;bull thistle&quot;) as a noxious weed in nine states. Some species in particular are cultivated in gardens and wildflower plantings for their aesthetic value and/or to support pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species dubbed weeds by various interest groups can also provide these benefits. &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;, for instance, ranked in the top 10 for nectar production in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot; was also a top producer of nectar sugar in another study in Britain, ranked third with a production per floral unit of (2323 ± 418μg). Not only does it provide abundant nectar, it provides seeds for birds, such as the European goldfinch &quot;Carduelis carduelis&quot;, and supports the larvae of the Painted Lady butterfly &quot;Vanessa cardui&quot;. Some other common species are &quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;, &quot;Cirsium palustre, Cirsium oleraceum&quot;.

Some ecological organizations, such as the Xerces Society, have attempted to raise awareness of the benefits of thistles, to counteract the general agricultural and home garden labeling of thistles as unwanted weeds. The monarch butterfly (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;), for instance, was highlighted as relying upon thistles such as tall thistle (&quot;Cirsium altissimum&quot;) as nectar sources during its migration. Some prairie and wildflower seed production companies in the United States supply bulk seed of native North American thistle species for wildlife habitat restoration, although availability tends to be low. Thistles are particularly valued by bumblebees for their high nectar production.

Certain species of &quot;Cirsium&quot;, like &quot;Cirsium monspessulanum&quot;, &quot;Cirsium pyrenaicum&quot; and &quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;, have been traditionally used as food in rural areas of southern Europe. &quot;Cirsium oleraceum&quot; is cultivated as a food source in Japan and India. &quot;Cirsium setidens&quot; is used as a vegetable in Korean cuisine.

&#x27;Cirsium&#x27; is the Greek word for thistle, &quot;kirsos&quot;, likely derived from &#x27;swollen vein&#x27;. The flower blooms April to August.

<text>The United States Park Police (USPP) is the oldest uniformed federal law enforcement agency in the United States. It functions as a full-service law enforcement agency with responsibilities and jurisdiction in those National Park Service areas primarily located in the Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and New York City areas and certain other government lands. United States Park Police officers have jurisdictional authority in the surrounding metropolitan areas of the three cities it primarily operates in, meaning they possess both state and federal authority. In addition to performing the normal crime prevention, investigation, and apprehension functions of an urban police force, the Park Police are responsible for policing many of the famous monuments in the United States.

The USPP shares law enforcement jurisdiction in all lands administered by the National Park Service with a force of National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers tasked with the same law enforcement powers and responsibilities. The agency also provides protection for the president, secretary of the interior, and visiting dignitaries. The Park Police is an operation of the National Park Service, which is an agency of the Department of the Interior. As of April 8, 2022, the force consisted of 494 officers.

== History ==
The Park Watchmen were first recruited in 1791 by George Washington to protect federal property in the District of Columbia. The police functioned as an independent agency of the federal government until 1849, when it was placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. In 1867, Congress transferred the police to the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, under the supervision of the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Watchmen were given the same powers and duties as the Metropolitan Police of Washington in 1882. Their name was officially changed to the present United States Park Police in 1919. In 1925, Congress placed the Park Police in the newly created Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital. Headed by an Army officer, Lt. Col. Ulysses S. Grant III, the office reported directly to the president of the United States. In 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt transferred the police to the National Park Service.

Their authority first began to expand outside D.C. in 1929, and today they are primarily responsible for the Gateway National Recreation Area units in New York City-New Jersey and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, as well as the many designated areas in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring counties in Maryland and Virginia. These sites include the National Mall, the C&amp;O Canal towpath in the region, and the parallel roadways of the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Virginia and Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland, as well as the federally maintained segment of the Baltimore Washington Parkway in Maryland.

The current sidearm is the SIG Sauer P320 which replaced the Heckler &amp; Koch P2000 in service.

==Authority==
The force functions as a unit of the National Park Service with jurisdiction in all federal parks. U.S. Park Police officers are located in the Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco metropolitan areas, and investigate and detain persons suspected of committing offenses against the United States. Officers also carry out services for many notable events conducted in the national parks. The U.S. Park Police are able to effect an arrest without a warrant in any unit of the National Park System, the District of Columbia, and the environs of the District of Columbia.

Park Police have authority to follow a vehicle outside their jurisdiction if the offense was committed within the park. According to Park Police policy, lethal force can only be used when there is &quot;imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm&quot;.

In Virginia, USPP Officers are provided with Conservator of the Peace powers as set forth in 19.2-12 of the Code of Virginia with powers and duties provided under 19.2-18 of the Code of Virginia. In Washington, D.C., itself, USPP Officers have the same powers and duties as the D.C. Metropolitan Police. USPP Officers possess a limited arrest authority in the State of Maryland. The U.S. Park Police hold state arrest authority in New York [New York State CPL 2.15 part 9], and state arrest authority in New Jersey [New Jersey Code 2A:154-6]. In California, arrest powers are provided under California Penal Code Section 830.8. These state arrest powers are in addition to powers held as federal officers. The U.S. Park Police primarily enforce laws including but not limited to Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and other federal statutes such as 16 USC and 18 USC, as well as state and local laws.

===Leadership===

In May 2023, Jessica M. E. Taylor replaced Pamela A. Smith as the chief of the US Park Police. Taylor came to the role with 25 years of experience in federal law enforcement, previously having served as a special agent in U.S. Secret Service, Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Office of the Inspector General, and Director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division.

Christopher S. Cunningham serves as the Assistant Chief of Police, and Jeffrey E. Schneider, Scott H. Brecht, and Lelani S. Woods Serve as Deputy Chiefs. 

=== Districts ===
The United States Park Police operates patrol district stations in the New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas.

U.S. Park Police officers are charged with protecting national icons such as the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, and other well known monuments and memorials. This is accomplished through the Homeland Security Division, which consists of the Intelligence/Counter-Terrorism Unit, the New York field office, and the Icon Protection Branch, which consists of the Central District Station and Special Forces.

===Specialized units===
The U.S. Park Police manages a Marine Unit, an Aviation Unit, Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT), a Canine Unit, a Motorcycle Unit, a Special Events Unit, a Traffic Safety Unit, a Horse Mounted Unit and a Criminal Investigations Branch.

==== Aviation ====
The missions of the United States Park Police Aviation Unit include aviation support for law enforcement, medevac, search and rescue, high-risk prisoner transport and presidential and dignitary security. The Aviation Unit has provided accident-free, professional aviation services for over 40 years. They were the first helicopter provider of Air medical services within Washington, D.C, and continue to provide these services 24/7 to the district and neighboring jurisdictions. They also provide an invaluable resource for patrolling and performing rescues at the numerous federal parks and recreation areas within the National Capital Region, such as Great Falls Park and Shenandoah National Park. Like many park environments, injured parties in these remote and difficult to access locations require specialized rescue equipment to access and retrieve persons in distress. The US Park Police Aviation Unit is the primary resource for these remote rescues requiring helicopter access.

The Aviation Unit of the United States Park Police began in April 1973 and was placed under the command of Lt. Richard T. Chittick. It started with one Bell 206B JetRanger and a staff of three pilots and three rescue technicians based at the Anacostia Naval Air Station in a shared space with the MPD Aviation Branch. A second helicopter, a Bell 206B-3 JetRanger, was added in 1975 and the unit relocated to Andrews AFB. The Aviation Unit moved to its present facility in Anacostia Park, the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest,&quot; in 1976. In 1983, the 206B-3 was upgraded to a Bell206L-3 LongRanger. Their first twin-engine helicopter, a Bell 412SP, and the third helicopter to carry the designation &quot;Eagle One,&quot; was placed in service in January 1991. The unit grew to its current staff, and began providing 24-hour coverage in January 1994.

In August 1999, the unit took delivery of its second twin-engine helicopter, a Bell 412EP. It became the fourth helicopter in the unit&#x27;s history to carry the designation &quot;Eagle One&quot; and the same registration number as that of an earlier aircraft whose crew affected the rescue of victims after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90. In May 2016, the unit received a replacement for &quot;Eagle Two&quot; with a used &amp; reconditioned Bell 412EP to replace the aging aircraft delivered in 1991.

The crews of U.S. Park Police Aviation resources are frequently called to assist at significant and historical disasters and emergency incidents throughout the National Capital Region. These incidents include the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon, the D.C. sniper attacks throughout the region, the 1982 crashing of Air Florida Flight 90, and the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting. During the June 2017 Congressional baseball shooting, the crews of U.S. Park Police Aviation responded with two helicopters and transported Congressman Steve Scalise and a U.S. Capitol Police Officer to the trauma center at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

==Organization and rank structure==

==Notable events==
In January 1982 USPP helicopter pilot Don Usher and his partner Gene Windsor saved the lives of five passengers from the Air Florida Flight 90 crash. Usher and Windsor, at great risk to themselves and lacking a winch or any sort of rescue equipment, flew their Bell 206 &quot;Eagle Two&quot; inches above the frozen Potomac River to pull the survivors from the 34°F (1.1°C) water before depositing them ashore for waiting ambulance crews. At one point, Usher flew the helicopter so close to the river that the skids went below the water as Windsor stood on them to tie a rescue line around surviving flight attendant Kelly Duncan, who couldn&#x27;t grip the life preserver thrown to her due to hypothermia. She was lifted to shore after spending 25 minutes in the freezing river. 

In December 1982, Norman Mayer threatened to blow up the Washington Monument with a truck he said contained explosives. A standoff with U.S. Park police began at 9:20 in the morning. It ended ten hours later after the suspect backed up the truck, then surged forward. Police fired dozens of shots at the tires and engine block, overturning the van. One of the bullets ricocheted and fatally struck Mayer in the head. No explosives were found in the van.

In 1989, Officers David Duffey and William Lovegrove rescued two people in the Glen Echo Flood after a parking lot collapsed.

In 1990, Officer Katherine Heller was at Lafayette Park when she was approached by a man who had been assaulted. After Heller radioed a description of the attacker, another Park Police officer, Scott Dahl, spotted a man matching the description and approached him. The alleged assailant began fighting with the officer and wrested the officer&#x27;s service pistol away from him. Heller approached and shot the man in the chest. For this act of valor, Heller was named Police Officer of the Year by Parade Magazine and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. She was the first U.S. Park Police officer, and the first female officer, to receive the IACP award.

In 1993, officers of the Park Police rescued passengers of the Golden Venture ship, which had run aground on the beach at Fort Tilden in Rockaway, Queens. Park police officers were the first to arrive on the scene. After calling for backup, they ran into the ocean and pulled survivors from the cold water.

In 1994 Park Police shot and killed a homeless man on the sidewalk in front of the White House. The man was brandishing a large hunting knife taped to his hand and refused to surrender during a confrontation with the officers.

The two helicopters of the U.S. Park Police played an important role after the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon. The crews responded immediately, transporting injured personnel to hospitals. The helicopters served as a command and control platform, using their Forward Looking Infrared equipment to provide firefighters with intelligence about the scope and spread of the fire through the five rings of the structure, and taking over air traffic control for the Washington, D.C., airspace after the controllers at Washington National Airport had to evacuate due to thick smoke.

In 2011, U.S. Park Police conducted an investigation after the arrest of five dancers at the Jefferson Memorial. In a video posted to YouTube, Park Police appeared to body slam and choke an individual who was silently dancing. The dance was in protest of the ban on dancing at memorials.

U.S. Park Police played a role in the Washington Navy Yard shooting on September 16, 2013. Two U.S. Park Police officers, Andrew Wong and Carl Hiott, were involved in the response. The shooter was killed by D.C. Police Emergency Response Team officer Dorian DeSantis, who took fire, and a U.S Park Police Officer. U.S. Park Police Eagle 1 also conducted a rescue mission and removed an injured shooting victim from the roof of building 197 along with three other survivors ultimately saving their lives.

In 2014, Park Police launched a crackdown on food truck operators. Park Police handcuffed food vendors who were selling to tourists on the National Mall. Vendors suggested that the enforcement was to protect the revenue from the government&#x27;s food stands. By September 2014, Park Police had arrested 196 people over the year for vending without a license on the mall, some of whom were jailed.

In 2015, U.S. Park Police detained an on-duty Secret Service special agent who was part of a detail for US Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The Park Police were sued following the incident for violating the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizures.

In 2016, Park Police aggressively enforced traffic regulations outside Arlington National Cemetery. Officers hid behind bushes to catch cabdrivers picking up passengers, claiming that idling cars were parked. Charges brought by the Park Police were dropped on appeal.

In 2017, Park Police handcuffed teens who were selling water on the National Mall. DC Councilmember Charles Allen asked whether arresting the teens was the appropriate response.

In November 2017, Park Police shot and killed Bijan Ghaisar, an unarmed Virginia man after a hit and run and three separate vehicle pursuits. More than eight months after the incident, Park Police provided no explanation for the killing. According to a lawsuit filed by the family, it was twelve hours following the incident before the family learned that Park Police were involved. Two days after the shooting, Park Police Chief Robert MacLean met with the family. MacLean offered condolences but provided no information about what had happened. The Ghaisar family was not allowed to touch their son for three days following the incident, when he was guarded by the department&#x27;s officers. According to the family, when a doctor arrived to examine Ghaisar for organ donation, the Park Police denied access, declaring the brain-dead man &quot;under arrest&quot; and his body &quot;evidence.&quot; More than nine months after the incident, Chief MacLean refused to speak to media about the incident, while Fairfax County Police, who filmed the shooting, said that the episode showed that greater transparency was needed. After more than a year and in response to a lawsuit, US Park Police named the shooters as officers Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya. The incident was not captured on a body cam, since Park Police are forbidden from wearing body cameras while on the job. In a 2015 memo written by Chief MacLean, he told the entire force not to use any audio or video recorders &quot;while on duty&quot;. MacLean claimed that the lack of a department-wide policy justified the ban on cameras. Following the shooting, in 2018 DC Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill to require uniformed federal police officers to wear body cameras and have dashboard cameras in marked vehicles. The legislation was directly in response to Ghaisar&#x27;s death. Chief MacLean backed out of a scheduled meeting with Holmes Norton and Representative Don Beyer to discuss the matter, prompting Holmes Norton to make a statement to &quot;express our astonishment&quot; at his absence. More than two years after the killing, Park Police had not launched an internal investigation into the matter or released recordings of the 911 calls the Park Police received.

In 2019, the sexual assault of a female Park Police officer by her male colleague two years earlier was disclosed. The attack occurred inside a Park Police station. Despite a protection order requiring 100 yards of distance between the two officers, Park Police continued to assign the officers to roles where they might be in contact. The assaulting officer was not suspended or terminated.
On June 1, 2020, USPP officers cleared the streets bordering Lafayette Park, DC of protesters on the order of Attorney General William Barr. Reporting news crews, Rev. Gini Gerbasi of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal, and many protesters noted the use of tear gas, flashbangs, and rubber bullets to disperse the peaceful crowds. Park Police officers on foot, and mounted on horseback, used riot gear such as batons and shields to drive assembled crowds further away from the park. The USPP released a statement that stated &quot;no tear gas was used&quot; by any law enforcement agency during the incident. Media subsequently reported that USPP assaulted the protesters with pepper spray canisters, which were found at the scene. Australian journalists who were reporting live from the scene were assaulted by Park Police during the operation. The incident prompted a diplomatic complaint by the Australian government. Two park police officers were assigned to administrative duties. This specific incident was referred to the Department of the Interior’s Office of the Inspector General but that investigation was still ongoing as of August 2021 and no relevant report currently appears on the OIG website. In June 2021, the Department of the Interior, Inspector General, issued its Review of U.S. Park Police Actions at Lafayette Park, and stated the Secret Service acted contrary to the operational plan and before the Park Police gave any dispersal warnings to the crowd. The Secret Service began advancing seven minutes before any dispersal order was given.The early deployment increased tensions between law enforcement officers and protestors.They faced resistance and used pepper spray in response to eggs and bottles being thrown at them. Park Police officers also began to clear the crowd before completing the final dispersal orders and 25 minutes before a planned curfew that was earlier announced by the mayor. Park Police commanders could not say who issued the order to deploy or why police radio transmissions were not recorded as required.

In July 2021, a unanimous jury awarded $730,000 in a police misconduct case against two Park Police officers for unlawfully detaining and taunting a man with their weapons while cursing at him despite having no suspicion of criminal activity on the man’s part.

On September 9th, 2023, Mikhail Olson, a popular Roblox developer was arrested by United States Park Police Officers after a concealed unattended firearm was located at the Roblox Developer Conference at Fort Mason in San Francisco, California. Officers also discovered an illegal large-capacity magazine and armor-piercing ammunition. Mikhail Olson attempted to evade the officers. He was booked into the San Francisco County Jail.

<text>The Democratic Party (; , abbr. DS) is a social democratic political party in Serbia. Srđan Milivojević has led the party as its president since 2024. The party is colloquially known as the &quot;žuti&quot; (yellows) because of one of its main colours.

DS was founded in 1990 by a group of intellectuals who sought to revive the Democratic Party, which was active in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Dragoljub Mićunović was the first president of DS until 1994 and under his leadership DS gained representation in the National Assembly of Serbia and took part in anti-government protests against Slobodan Milošević. After Zoran Đinđić&#x27;s election as president of DS in 1994, DS was reorganised. Đinđić led the party into the Together coalition, and DS took part in the 1996–1997 protests that occurred after the Electoral Commission invalidated local election results in cities in which the Together coalition had won. DS later led the , which became part of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) in January 2000. DOS won the 2000 Yugoslav general election, but Milošević, the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and president of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), declined to accept the results, culminating in his overthrow.

DS assumed power in Serbia after winning parliamentary elections in December 2000 and Đinđić then became prime minister. Đinđić was assassinated in March 2003 and succeeded by Boris Tadić as president of DS. Tadić also became president of Serbia while DS was in opposition from 2004 to 2007 when it became part of a coalition government led by DSS. Tadić led DS to victory in 2008 when a coalition government with SPS was formalised. DS was defeated by the Serbian Progressive Party in 2012 and went into opposition. Dragan Đilas became the president of DS in December 2012; he was ousted as mayor of Belgrade in 2013 but survived an internal motion of no confidence in January 2014. He was succeeded by Bojan Pajtić in May 2014. Dragan Šutanovac became the president of DS after Pajtić&#x27;s resignation in 2016. Šutanovac was then succeeded by Zoran Lutovac in 2018. Lutovac led DS into several opposition coalitions and boycotted the 2020 parliamentary election, causing a schism in the party. He successfully led DS back into the National Assembly in the 2022 election.

DS was a catch-all party in its early years, occupying the centrist and centre-right position. It supported the establishment of a market economy, denationalisation, and union rights. DS shifted to a centrist and socially liberal profile under Tadić and became the leading party of the pro-European bloc of Serbian politics. It shifted towards social democracy in 2013, and is now positioned on the centre-left on the political spectrum. Its supporters tend to be female, high school or university educated, tolerant towards diversity, socially progressive, and opposed to authoritarianism and nationalism. DS is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists and a member of the Progressive Alliance and Socialist International.

== History ==
=== Formation ===

On 11 December 1989, a group of intellectualsincluding anti-communist dissidents, liberal academics, poets, writers, and film and theatre directorsheld a press conference announcing the revival of the Democratic Party (DS), at which they also released a written proclamation. DS had existed in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia until 1945, when the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, later known as League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), came to power; as such, DS claims that it was &quot;re-founded&quot; (&quot;obnovljena&quot;), instead of categorising itself as a new political party. The original thirteen signatories of the proclamation of the Founding Committee included Kosta Čavoški, Milovan Danojlić, Zoran Đinđić, Gojko Đogo, Vladimir Gligorov, Slobodan Inić, Marko Janković, Vojislav Koštunica, Dragoljub Mićunović, Borislav Pekić, Miodrag Perišić, Radoslav Stojanović, and Dušan Vukajlović. Their programmatic proclamation, named Letter of Intents (&quot;Pismo o namerama&quot;), attracted even more intellectuals who eventually joined DS.

In 1989, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was still a one-party state; DS thus became the first opposition, non-communist party in Yugoslavia. With the disintegration of the SKJ that began in January 1990, its constituent republics, later including Serbia in July 1990, adopted multi-party systems. DS organised its founding assembly on 3 February 1990 at the Belgrade Youth Center. The first presidency of the DS was contested between Čavoški and Mićunović, with the latter ultimately winning the position. Ideological differences between the two existed; Čavoški wanted the party to adopt a more nationalist and anti-communist rhetoric, while Mićunović was viewed as a liberal. Although Čavoški lost in the leadership election, he was elected president of the party&#x27;s executive board; Pekić became the deputy president of the DS.

According to Mićunović, Čavoški initially registered the party in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in March 1990 because Serbia had not yet adopted a law authorising a multi-party system. DS was later registered in Serbia on 27 July 1990.

=== 1990–1993: the Mićunović years ===
After its establishment, the DS began publishing its newspaper, &quot;Demokratija&quot; (), and it also established the Democratic Youth, its youth wing. Gligorov and Inić, who worked on the economic programme of the party, left DS also shortly after its formation due to ideological disagreements. At its second assembly in September 1990, Mićunović was re-elected president of DS while Koštunica and were elected vice-presidents. A month later, DS announced that it would take part in the 1990 Serbian parliamentary election. This decision was opposed by Čavoški and Nikola Milošević, who advocated for an election boycott instead. Čavoški previously proposed that opposition parties should receive television air time, representation on electoral bodies, and for the campaign to last 90 days in total. Čavoški and Milošević left DS shortly before the December 1990 election, claiming that fair electoral conditions had not been created. They then formed the Serbian Liberal Party (SLS) in January 1991. Đinđić succeeded Čavoški as the president of the party&#x27;s executive board. Despite winning 7 percent of the popular vote in the 1990 election, DS only won 7 seats in the National Assembly due to Serbia&#x27;s new first-past-the-post electoral system, which favoured the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), the then-ruling and largest party of Serbia.

Together with the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), DS organised mass protests in Belgrade in March 1991, demanding reforms of the Radio Television of Serbia (RTS). As a result of the protests, SPO leader Vuk Drašković was let go, and the RTS director resigned. After the break-up of Yugoslavia in early 1992, Serbia became a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. DS boycotted the May 1992 federal parliamentary elections and declined to accept the results, claiming that free and fair conditions had not been created for the election. Instead of campaigning, DS preferred to organise anti-government protests to force the government to call new elections. In June 1992, DS decided not to join the Democratic Movement of Serbia (DEPOS) coalition that had been created a month earlier. Koštunica led the &quot;DS for DEPOS&quot; faction that was in favour of joining DEPOS. He left the party after DS decided not to join the coalition, claiming that Mićunović and Đinđić were in a &quot;secret alliance&quot; with SPS. After leaving DS, he partnered with Mirko Petrović, Draško Petrović, and Vladan Batić and formed the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS).

After the mass protests, another federal parliamentary election was organised for December 1992. DS decided to take part in this election and it won 6 percent of the popular vote and 5 seats in the Federal Assembly. DS then joined the government led by Milan Panić, the then-incumbent prime minister of FR Yugoslavia. Simultaneously, in December 1992, general elections were organised in Serbia as a result of an October 1992 early elections referendum. Although DS opposed the referendum, it participated in the election, winning 6 seats. In the presidential election, however, DS supported Panić, who placed second behind Slobodan Milošević, the leader of SPS.

In 1993, Đinđić asserted himself in the party and led its operations going into the 1993 parliamentary election. Milošević ended his coalition with the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) in mid-1993 and turned towards DS for negotiations instead. Mićunović claimed that there was a meeting between Milošević and DS, although Zoran Živković has denied that claim. Đinđić invited several entrepreneurs to join DS during this period and DS was dubbed the &quot;yellow company&quot; from its opponents. Yellow was both an official colour of DS and the colour of Centromarket, a company owned by Slobodan Radulović, one of the entrepreneurs invited to join the party. Shortly before the 1993 election, DS agreed that Đinđić should be their ballot representative. He led DS under the &quot;Honestly&quot; (&quot;Pošteno&quot;) banner and visited over 100 locations in Serbia during the campaign period. Đinđić also said that he would retire from politics if DS won less than 20 seats. The campaign was successful: DS won 29 seats in the National Assembly. DS remained in opposition after the election as Đinđić was unable to bring DS into the SPS-led government.

=== 1994–2000: the Đinđić years ===

At a party congress on 25 January 1994, Đinđić was elected president, and Perišić and Miroljub Labus were elected vice-presidents of the party. Mićunović and Vida Ognjenović also resigned from their positions in DS during the congress. Đinđić commented that &quot;Mićunović&#x27;s time has passed... Mićunović is no Tina Turner who sounds better now than when she was 30&quot; (&quot;Mićunovićevo vreme je prošlo... Mićunović nije Tina Tarner pa da bolje zvuči sada nego sa trideset godina&quot;). By contrast, Mićunović characterised the manner of Đinđić&#x27;s takeover of DS as a &quot;combination of Machiavellianism and a revolutionary technique&quot; (&quot;spoj makijavelizma i revolucionarne tehnike&quot;). During this period, Đinđić also benefited from discreet support in the Milošević-controlled state-run media. After Đinđić became the president of DS, the party was reorganised and moved away from Mićunović&#x27;s &quot;intellectualistic&quot; approach. In 1995, DS rejected Slobodan Gavrilović&#x27;s proposal to reunite with DSS, while later that year, Mićunović left DS and then formed the Democratic Centre (DC) in 1996.

In September 1996, DS formed the Together coalition with SPO and the Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS) to take part in the federal parliamentary election and local elections, which were organised for November 1996. DSS also took part in the coalition, although only at the federal level. Together won 23 percent of the popular vote in the federal parliamentary elections; it also won local elections in key cities such as Belgrade, Niš, and Novi Sad. However, the Electoral Commission invalidated those local election results, which ultimately led to mass protests that were attended by hundreds of thousands of people in total. The aftermath of the protests resulted in Đinđić and Živković becoming mayors of Belgrade and Niš respectively, after the Electoral Commission recognised the results. In September 1997, Đinđić was removed from office after losing a motion of no confidence staged by SPO.

The Together coalition was dissolved shortly before the 1997 general elections. DS, DSS, and GSS opted to boycott the election, while SPO did not because the government partially accepted their demands. Čedomir Jovanović and Čedomir Antić, who led the Student Political Club during the 1996–1997 protests, joined DS in 1998. In the same year, DS became part of the , a moderate opposition coalition. This coalition later became part of a wider alliance, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) that was formed in January 2000. Đinđić faced Slobodan Vuksanović at a party congress in February 2000, with Đinđić ultimately retaining the position of party president. Živković and Gavrilović remained vice-presidents of DS and were joined by Predrag Filipov and Boris Tadić. Vuksanović left DS in October 2000 and formed the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (NDS) in 2001. Milošević, then-President of FR Yugoslavia, amended the federal constitution to provide for direct, rather than indirect, elections in the 2000 general elections. DOS nominated Koštunica as their presidential candidate. Koštunica faced Milošević in the presidential election which he won in the first round. However, Milošević declined to accept the results, and the Electoral Commission reported that Koštunica had not won more than 50 percent of the votes in the first round and that a second round would be scheduled instead. This culminated in mass protests which led to the overthrow of Milošević on 5 October 2000. The Electoral Commission published the actual results two days later, confirming that Koštunica had won in the first round. Together with SPS and SPO, DOS agreed to organise a snap parliamentary election in December 2000 in which DOS won 176 out of 250 seats in the National Assembly.

=== 2001–2004: Post-Milošević period ===

In January 2001, Đinđić was elected prime minister of Serbia; his cabinet was composed of 16 ministers. Following the extradition of Milošević to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in June 2001, members of DSS left his cabinet. DS also adopted its new programme that marked the beginning of the party&#x27;s shift towards the left. DS nominated Labus, who, at the time, was the leader of a citizens&#x27; group, in the presidential election that was organised for September 2002. The election proceeded to a second round, in which Labus placed second. However, the election was invalidated because less than 50 percent of registered voters turned out to vote, and another election was organised for December 2002. Labus subsequently became the president of G17 Plus (G17+), a think tank that he registered as a political party. DS initially stated its intent to support Koštunica but DSS declined their support. The December 2002 presidential election was also invalidated as a result of low turnout, and a third presidential election was organised for November 2003.

Đinđić, who was opposed to organised crime, escaped an assassination attempt in February 2003. Đinđić sought to tackle and reduce organised crime and corruption while he also previously introduced security measures due to the growing threats from paramilitary groups and organised crime. One month later, on 12 March 2003, Zvezdan Jovanović, a member of the Serbian Mafia&#x27;s Zemun Clan, assassinated Đinđić as he was exiting a vehicle in front of a government building.

Živković succeeded Đinđić as prime minister of Serbia and as the acting president of DS. In the presidential election in 2003, DS supported Mićunović as part of the DOS coalition. He placed second, but the election was invalidated as a result of low (38 percent) voter turnout. During his premiership, Živković lost confidence from the Social Democratic Party, and he announced that he would not reshuffle his cabinet but call a snap parliamentary election instead; Nataša Mićić, the president of the National Assembly, confirmed that the election would be held in December 2003. DOS then disbanded, and DS nominated Tadić to represent its list in the election instead. DS was on a joint ballot list with DSS, DC, Social Democratic Union (SDU), and List for Sandžak (LZS). The DS list won 37 seats in the National Assembly, out of which 22 went to DS alone, resulting in DS being in opposition.

At the party congress in February 2004, Tadić and Živković nominated themselves as candidates for the presidency, with the former ultimately becoming the president on 22 February 2004. Mićunović&#x27;s party merged with DS after Tadić&#x27;s election as president of DS. Otpor, an organisation that played a key role in the overthrow of Milošević, also merged into DS in 2004.

The National Assembly amended the Law on the Election of the President of the Republic in February 2004, abolishing the 50 percent voter turnout requirement in presidential elections. DS then nominated Tadić as its presidential candidate in the election that was scheduled for June 2004. Tadić placed second in the first round, but won in the second round with 53 percent of the popular vote, defeating Tomislav Nikolić of SRS. In December 2004, Tadić expelled Jovanović from the party for breaching party protocol; Jovanović formed the Liberal Democratic Party a year later.

=== 2005–2012: the Tadić years ===

During Tadić&#x27;s first term as president of Serbia, he apologised to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia for Serbia&#x27;s role in the Yugoslav Wars and pursued a pro-Western foreign policy. He was reelected, unopposed, as DS president at the party&#x27;s congress in 2006. In late 2006, G17+ withdrew from Koštunica&#x27;s government which led Tadić to schedule a snap parliamentary election for January 2007. DS chose Ružica Đinđić, the spouse of Zoran Đinđić, as their ballot representative, campaigning on continuing Đinđić&#x27;s legacy and fighting against corruption. DS also promised not to form a coalition government with SPS or SRS. DS won over 900,000 votes and negotiated with DSS and G17+ to form a coalition government; Koštunica remained as prime minister and Božidar Đelić of DS was appointed deputy prime minister in his cabinet. In December 2007, Oliver Dulić, the president of the National Assembly, announced that he had scheduled presidential elections for January 2008. DS nominated Tadić for reelection. He again faced Nikolić in the second round of the election and was successfully re-elected.

Shortly after the 2008 presidential election, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence, as well as the issue of European integration, resulted in a political crisis between DS and G17+ on one side and DSS on the other. Koštunica embraced anti-Western positions and was a hardliner on the Kosovo issue; he blamed his coalition partners for &quot;creating an unworkable rift in the government&quot; during his resignation speech. Koštunica also said that &quot;he could no longer rule in a coalition with DS&quot;, and as a result, Tadić announced a snap parliamentary election for May 2008. Prior to the election, DS formed the For a European Serbia (ZES) coalition composed of DS, G17+, SDP, SPO, the Democratic Alliance of Croats in Vojvodina (DSHV), and the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina (LSV). This coalition nominated Mićunović as their ballot representative and campaigned on continuing negotiations for the accession of Serbia to the European Union. ZES placed first, winning 102 seats in the National Assembly; DS won 64 seats out of those 102. After the election, DS was excluded from government formation talks, and in June 2008, it entered talks with SPS to form a coalition government. DS and SPS agreed to continue Serbia&#x27;s accession to the European Union, work on fighting crime and corruption, and enact social justice reforms to help the vulnerable sections of the population. DS and SPS formalised their cooperation after the election by signing a reconciliation agreement. The new government was formed in July 2008, with Mirko Cvetković, an independent politician affiliated with DS, serving as prime minister and Ivica Dačić, the leader of SPS, serving as deputy prime minister.

The DS-led government was faced with the arrest and trial of Radovan Karadžić, the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, and the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), now led by Nikolić, arranged mass protests in 2011, demanding that Tadić call snap elections; Tadić complied, and called an election in March 2012 to be held two months later in May. In April, however, Tadić announced that he would resign as president and that presidential elections would be held on the same day as the parliamentary election. DS led the Choice for a Better Life (IZBŽ) coalition that also included DSHV, LSV, the Social Democratic Party of Serbia, the Greens of Serbia, and the Christian Democratic Party of Serbia. Dragan Đilas, the deputy president of DS and mayor of Belgrade, was chosen as the coalition&#x27;s ballot representative. DS campaigned on economic recovery, emphasising attracting foreign investments and developing small business. IZBŽ placed second, winning 67 seats, and 49 of those were won by DS alone. In the presidential election, Tadić placed first in the first round of voting, but lost to Nikolić in the second.

Following the 2012 parliamentary election, SPS successfully formed a government with SNS, and DS went into opposition. Đilas, who was re-elected as mayor of Belgrade, was positioned as a prominent candidate to succeed Tadić as president of DS. An extraordinary party congress was called for 25 November 2012, with Đilas and Branimir Kuzmanović put forward as the only candidates to succeed Tadić as president of DS. Đilas was elected president in a landslide victory and Tadić was awarded the title of an honorary president. Additionally, Pajtić was re-elected as vice-president and was joined by Nataša Vučković, Vesna Martinović, Dejan Nikolić, Miodrag Rakić, Goran Ćirić, and Jovan Marković. Živković criticised the measure to award Tadić the honorary president title and described it as a &quot;rotten compromise between Đilas and Tadić&quot;; this led to his departure from DS. After leaving DS, Živković announced the formation of the New Party (Nova). As president of DS, Đilas ordered former government ministers to resign from the National Assembly. This order received support from Tadić, but was criticised by Mićunović and Dušan Petrović, the former minister of agriculture, who refused to resign.

=== 2013–2017: Internal crisis ===
Petrović was expelled from DS in January 2013 and subsequently formed a parliamentary group named Together for Serbia (ZZS) which was later registered as a political party. Former minister of foreign affairs Vuk Jeremić was expelled from DS in February 2013. Jeremić claimed that the party&#x27;s decision was unconstitutional and filed a suit in the Constitutional Court. His appeal was rejected; Jeremić complied with the decision and left DS, although he kept his seat in the National Assembly. DS also dropped to 13 percent support amongst the public while SNS received over 40 percent. In September 2013, SNS filed a motion of no confidence against Đilas, resulting in his dismissal. SNS cited DS&#x27; poor results and asserted that &quot;DS lost legitimacy&quot; as reasons for the motion while Đilas stated that &quot;this is the beginning of a dictatorship and a one-party system&quot; (&quot;smatra da je to uvod u diktaturu i jednopartijski sistem&quot;). As a consequence, local boards of DS called for Đilas to resign as president of DS. Tadić was accused of conspiring against Đilas in a bid to return to the post of president of DS, and the accusations called attention to the conflict between Đilas and Tadić. This resulted in an internal party motion of no confidence against Đilas. He survived. Đilas and Pajtić also suggested that an extraordinary congress should be held after the Belgrade City Assembly election which was ultimately scheduled for March 2014. Tadić left DS on 30 January 2014, citing his disagreement with party leadership. Shortly after, Tadić announced that he would begin collecting signatures to register his new party, the New Democratic Party later renamed the Social Democratic Party, to participate in the snap parliamentary election scheduled to be held on the same day as the Belgrade City Assembly election.

DS announced that it would take part in the 2014 parliamentary election with Nova, DSHV, Rich Serbia, and the United Trade Unions of Serbia &quot;Sloga&quot; as part of the With the Democratic Party for a Democratic Serbia coalition. The coalition only won 19 seats in the National Assembly; DS won 17 seats and Nova won 2. In the Belgrade City Assembly election, the DS coalition won 22 seats. After the elections, an extraordinary congress was organised on 31 May 2014. Pajtić faced Đilas and Pajtić was successfully elected to the presidency of DS. Đilas subsequently resigned from his position as a member of the National Assembly and left DS in June 2016. Borko Stefanović, a vice-president of DS, left the party in December 2015, citing ideological differences, and then formed the Serbian Left (LS). In March 2016, Nikolić called for snap parliamentary elections to take place in April 2016. DS then formed the &quot;For a Just Serbia&quot; coalition with Nova, ZZS, DSHV, and Together for Šumadija. The coalition won 16 seats in the National Assembly, 12 of which were occupied by DS. After the election, a party congress was organised for 24 September 2016. Pajtić faced Dragan Šutanovac, Zoran Lutovac, and Srboljub Antić in the leadership election. He ultimately lost to Šutanovac in the first round. Marković, Branislav Lečić, Nada Kolundžija, Goran Salak, and Tamara Tripić were elected vice-presidents.

In January 2017, Šutanovac announced that DS would support Saša Janković in the 2017 presidential election instead of filing its own candidate. DS also called for other parties to rally around Janković as a joint opposition candidate. During the campaign, Janković used the infrastructure of DS to position himself as the leader of the opposition. He placed second behind Aleksandar Vučić of SNS, winning 16 percent of the popular vote. After the election, Janković stopped cooperating with DS and formed the Movement of Free Citizens (PSG) in May 2017. In preparation for the 2018 Belgrade City Assembly election, DS advocated for the opposition parties to participate on a joint list. By the end of 2017, DS had announced that it would take part in a coalition with Nova, with Šutanovac as their mayoral candidate.

=== 2018–2024: the Lutovac years ===

DS and Nova were joined by Tadić&#x27;s SDS in January 2018, while the Green Ecological Party – The Greens also appeared on the ballot. However, the coalition did not win any seats as it only received 2 percent of the popular vote. This led to the resignations of Šutanovac and Balša Božović, the president of the DS branch in Belgrade.

In April 2018, DS announced that a party congress would be arranged for 2 June 2018. The leadership election was contested by Lutovac, Branislav Lečić, and Gordana Čomić. Lutovac ultimately won the election. Nikolić, Aleksandra Jerkov, Dragana Rakić, Dragoslav Šumarac, and Saša Paunović were elected vice-presidents. Lutovac announced that DS &quot;must organise itself&quot; and that DS would cooperate with the Alliance for Serbia (SZS), a group in the City Assembly of Belgrade led by Đilas. However, SZS was reorganised as a nationwide coalition in September 2018 that, in addition to DS, included ZZS, Sloga, LS, Jeremić&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party (Narodna), Dveri, the Movement for Reversal (PZP), and Healthy Serbia. In internal DS deliberations, founding members Mićunović and Ognjenović, as well as Čomić and Šutanovac, were opposed to joining SZS. After the physical attack on the leader of LS in November 2018, SZS organised mass anti-government protests. In January 2019, DS announced its intent to boycott the sessions of the National Assembly, the City Assembly of Belgrade, and the Assembly of Vojvodina, claiming that the bodies did not have legitimacy due to the government&#x27;s obstruction of the parliamentary opposition by allegedly &quot;violating the rules of Parliament, as well as laws and the Constitution&quot;. DS also signed the &quot;Agreement with the People&quot; which stated that if fair and free conditions for elections were not met, it would boycott the 2020 parliamentary election.

In February 2019, Lutovac and Tadić began discussing merging their parties to become &quot;the main option for civic-democratic voters that will be able to integrate voters that are against Aleksandra Vučić&quot; (&quot;glavna opcija za građansko-demokratske birače i koja će biti u stanju da integriše snage koje su protiv Aleksandra Vučića&quot;). This decision was approved by both DS and SDS. ZZS, led by Nebojša Zelenović, also joined the talks. The merger was formalised as a union in May 2019 under the name United Democratic Party. The merger was to be completed upon the relaxation of COVID-19 pandemic measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, SDS left the process, with Tadić later claiming that Lutovac allegedly put an end to the merger. As part of SZS, in September 2019 DS announced that it would boycott the 2020 parliamentary election. The decision to boycott the election received criticism from some DS members, such as Mićunović and Šutanovac, who stated that DS officials in response would create citizens&#x27; groups to encourage voting in the elections. During a session of the party&#x27;s main board in November 2019, Lečić, Jerkov, Božović, Radoslav Milojičić, and Slobodan Milosavljević left a meeting to attempt to break quorum after demanding a new leadership election. Lutovac described the move as a coup d&#x27;état and claimed that Vučić was attempting to break up DS. He also later claimed that a group inside DS was attempting to cooperate with Vučić. After attending a session in the National Assembly in February 2020, Čomić was expelled from DS. She was later featured on United Democratic Serbia&#x27;s ballot and became a government minister.

DS&#x27; scheduled March 2020 party congress was postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and rescheduled for 21 June 2020 when the parliamentary election was also scheduled to be take place. During the party congress, a group of DS members left the congress to hold an alternate leadership election. The congress continued on 28 June 2020; the dissatisfied group held its own congress in Belgrade with Tadić in attendance, while Lutovac held the official party congress in Šabac. Lutovac then expelled Lečić, Božović, Milojičić and Milosavljević from DS. The dissatisfied group then chose Lečić as president. The Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government rejected Lečić&#x27;s request to be recognised as the legal president of DS, concluding that Lutovac was its legitimate president. Lečić then formed the Democrats of Serbia that later merged into Tadić&#x27;s SDS.

During the conflict between the two DS factions, SZS was dissolved and succeeded by the United Opposition of Serbia (UOPS). However, UOPS dissolved in January 2021 due to a dispute regarding inter-party dialogues on electoral conditions between Narodna and Party of Freedom and Justice (SSP), the party led by Đilas. DS organised a congress on 4 July 2021; Lutovac was reelected president and Rakić was reelected deputy president. Tatjana Manojlović, Nenad Mitrović, Miodrag Gavrilović, and Branimir Jovančićević were elected vice-presidents. After the congress, DS, Narodna, SSP, and PSG announced that they would cooperate in the 2022 Serbian general election. Their coalition was formalised in February 2022 under the name United for the Victory of Serbia (UZPS); they nominated Zdravko Ponoš of Narodna as their presidential candidate. UZPS won 14 percent of the popular vote in the parliamentary election; DS won 10 seats. Ponoš placed second in the presidential election behind Vučić. After the election, UZPS was dissolved with Lutovac stating that it was only a pre-election coalition. Shortly before the first constitutive session of the National Assembly on 1 August 2022, Narodna, DS, Do not let Belgrade drown, and Together nominated Lutovac for vice-president of the National Assembly. He was successfully elected on 2 August 2022. The Movement of Free Serbia, which was a part of the UZPS coalition, merged into DS in September 2022.

After the May 2023 Belgrade school shooting and mass murder in Mladenovac and Smederevo, DS was one of the organising parties of the mass protests. In August 2023, DS, Together, and Serbia Centre signed a cooperation agreement. DS became part of the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition in October 2023, a coalition of political parties organising the 2023 protests. SPN announced that it would contest the parliamentary, Vojvodina provincial, and Belgrade City Assembly elections, all scheduled for 17 December 2023. Manojlović resigned as vice-president of DS when her name was absent from the SPN electoral list for the parliamentary elections. In the parliamentary election, SPN won 65 seats, 8 of which went to DS. After the elections, SPN organised anti-government protests until 30 December. Once the 14th National Assembly of Serbia was constituted, DS formed its own parliamentary group, with Lutovac as its leader. The City Assembly of Belgrade, on the other hand, was not constituted because the quorum was not met during its constitutive session. Because of this, a new election was called for 2 June. SPN remained divided regarding the participation in the 2 June election, with DS being neutral on the matter. This led to the dissolution of SPN and establishment of the We Choose Belgrade electoral list. In the 2024 Belgrade City Assembly election, this electoral list only won 14 seats, 2 of which went to DS.

=== 2024–present: Consolidation under Milivojević ===
DS organised internal leadership elections on 14 December 2024, with Lutovac, Gavrilović, and Srđan Milivojević registering as candidates for the president of the party. Initially, Gavrilović had the support of most delegates, while Milivojević had none. However, Milivojević triumphed in the second round of the election and became the new president. Shortly after he became president, Milivojević launched a campaign of consolidation of progressive political parties. The Together party signed a declaration of merging on 27 December and became part of DS.

== Ideology and platform ==
=== Mićunović and Đinđić era ===
DS was a catch-all party during its early period and was composed of ideologically heterogeneous groups. It included the founders of the Praxis School, Mićunović and Đinđić, who were labelled liberals, as well as Čavoški, Koštunica, and Milošević, who argued for the adoption of a stronger anti-communist position inside the party. DS was also divided on nationalism, with members such as Gligorov and Inić arguing that nationalism should be solved within a common Yugoslav state, while members like Đogo favoured a Greater Serbian policy. DS supported a mixed economy with a strong role of the market, but it also sought to implement reforms towards establishing a modern market economy and integrating Serbia into the European Community. DS adopted a &quot;civic and centrist identity&quot;, and in its Letter of Intent of December 1989, it stated its support for the establishment of a democratic and multi-party system. Regarding Yugoslavia, DS supported federalisation and a pluralistic democratic order to guarantee human security and personal freedom and decrease ethnic conflicts.

Political scientist Dijana Vukomanović has argued that DS has promoted liberalism in an economic and democratic sense since its formation, and noted that, in its 1990 programme, DS emphasised establishing a representative parliamentary democracy, and advancing human and political freedoms and civic rights. By contrast, political scientist Vukašin Pavlović has noted that DS could be described as centre-right at the time of its formation in 1990 due to its founders&#x27; ideological positions. Likewise, Metropolitan University Prague lecturer Marko Stojić has described DS in its founding era as centre-right because its programme advocated a liberal market economy and minimal role for the state. Political scientist Vladimir Goati has positioned the 1990s DS on the moderate right, noting its support for private property rights and the omission of the regulatory and redistributive functions of the state from its 1992 programme. Goati has also categorised the party as liberal-democratic, explaining that after 1993, DS began to use less anti-communist rhetoric compared with other opposition parties. In 1991, then-&quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Blaine Harden described DS as a &quot;moderate, opposition&quot; party, and in a 1999 report, &quot;BBC News&quot; described DS as centrist. Scholar Slaviša Orlović has noted that the party &quot;provide[d] a balance of goals of the right and left political traditions&quot;.

Political scientist Slobodan Antonić has stated that although DS was formed as a civic partyin its 1992 programme, DS identified itself as a &quot;civic, national, liberal, and socially responsible&quot; partyit had a &quot;nationalistic phase&quot; in mid-1990s, supporting the &quot;modernisation of the country&quot; as well as the self-determination of Serbs, but that, soon after, it returned to civic positions. Additionally, political scientist Jovan Komšić has noted that DS moderated its stance on nationalism after the 1995 Dayton Agreement, thereafter focusing on the &quot;democratisation of Serbia&quot;. Goati has described DS as an anti-system party because it opposed the 1990 constitution.

Under Đinđić, DS shifted to more pragmatic and flexible approaches and principles, becoming the leading anti-Milošević party after 1998. Đinđić has been described as a pro-Western reformist and a technocrat. DS advocated for denationalisation and free mass distribution of shares, and established the Centre for Privatisation. However, DS also supported the right to work, trade union rights, social security, and the fight against unemployment. DS described these economic positions as &quot;people&#x27;s capitalism&quot;, but the party dropped these positions after coming to power in 2001, when it began promoting neoliberalism. DS was also associated with the &quot;shock therapy&quot; group of economic policies. DS supported policies that would bring Serbia closer to the West and reintegrate Serbia into the international community, and also supported the extradition of Serbian citizens that were indicted by the ICTY.

=== Tadić era ===

Despite trying to position itself as a social democratic party after Đinđić&#x27;s assassination, Vukomanović has argued that the leadership of DS did not &quot;dare to take a decisive step towards the left&quot;. Political scientist Zoran Stojiljković has noted that, instead, it shifted towards social liberalism. On the other hand, political scientist Zoran Slavujević argued in 2003 that, at the time, DS &quot;was still positioned between the centre and centre-right&quot;. Others have described DS under Tadić as centrist, and as associated with liberalism and social liberalism.

Tadić has been described as a liberal, a label he accepts. During his leadership, he was considered to be popular amongst businessmen due to his support for the accession of Serbia to the European Union. Despite being supported by liberals, DS would occasionally position itself as a &quot;state-building party of the centre-left&quot;. During Tadić&#x27;s tenure, DS was the leading party of the liberal and pro-European bloc, but it also promoted privatisation to accelerate Serbia&#x27;s economic development. Stojić has noted that DS&#x27; programmatic shift towards social democracy began in 2007, but while in government, DS did not pursue a social democratic agenda.

DS under Tadić has been described as internationalist and pro-Western. Although it also declared itself in favour of military neutrality, DS expressed sympathy for, and its government ministers cooperated with, NATO. DS also believed that the political status of Kosovo should be solved via diplomacy, although it did not adopt a clear stance on the issue following Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence in 2008. Under Tadić, DS took a balanced approach towards foreign relations; for example, a year after Kosovo&#x27;s declaration, Tadić hosted U.S. Vice-president Joe Biden and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for talks. Shortly before the 2012 elections, Serbia received candidate status for European Union membership.

To attract ethnic minority voters, DS exploited the cultural-ideological cleft in Vojvodina, seeking to attract voters from minority interests parties, and promoted regionalism. DS also advocated for the improvement of the standard of living and for a balanced regional development, and proposed the creation of an independent body that would implement anti-corruption measures in the judiciary.

=== Post-Tadić era ===
After 2012, DS shifted further to the left and began identifying itself as social democratic, a description which has since been accepted by scholars and political observers. Stojić has categorised DS as social democratic and as a party with a &quot;liberal legacy&quot;. DS has been described as being on the centre-left of the political spectrum. By contrast, Dušan Spasojević, a professor at the Faculty of Political Sciences of the University of Belgrade, has described DS&#x27; social views as being orientated towards the left. A former leader of DS, Zoran Lutovac, describes himself as a leftist.

DS has served in opposition to SNS since 2012. It has been critical of the government&#x27;s stance on Kosovo, although it supported the 2013 Brussels Agreement. In an interview, Šutanovac described the Kosovo issue as a &quot;not an everyday political problem&quot;. During the North Kosovo crisis in 2023, DS voiced its opposition to the Ohrid Agreement, with Lutovac claiming that &quot;the agreement does not respect the interests of Serbia and the rights of Serbs in Kosovo&quot; but also because DS &quot;does not want to give Vučić legitimacy for what he did&quot;.

When Đilas led DS in opposition to SNS during the 2014 election, he pledged to provide free textbooks for students and full salaries for pregnant women, increase wages for healthcare workers, and help pensioners. DS is opposed to jadarite mining and was one of the signatories of an agreement on the prohibition of exploration, exploitation, and processing of lithium in Serbia in October 2021.

DS has declared itself to be &quot;the bearer of the most progressive ideas&quot;; it is in favour of protecting workers, minorities, and the environment, and it supports guaranteed rights to healthcare, education, and pensions. In 2014, the Gay Straight Alliance, an association that promotes LGBT rights in Serbia, described DS as the &quot;most positive party towards the LGBT community&quot;. DS has condemned violence against the LGBT community and in August 2022, it supported hosting 2022 EuroPride in Belgrade. It has also criticised the attacks on the Pride Info Centre in Belgrade.

=== Demographic characteristics ===
Before the federal parliamentary election in December 1992, a majority of DS supporters preferred a citizen state (&quot;građanska država&quot;) over a nation state (&quot;nacionalna država&quot;). According to political scientist Dragomir Pantić, supporters of DS in the 1990s shared similar characteristics with supporters of DSS, GSS, and other minority parties. DS supporters were young and urban, and they came from the middle and upper classes. Public intellectuals, technicians, and those who worked in the private sector were also supporters of DS. After 2000, DS voters professed liberal-democratic values; they were also less religious, opposed to authoritarianism and centralism, and supportive of political reforms. Political scientist Ilija Vujačić, however, has argued that DS supporters in the 21st century skewed more towards the political centre. In 2007, political scientist Srećko Mihailović noted that a majority of DS supporters identified with the left—18% with the far-left, 22% with the left-wing, and 25% with the centre-left—while 18% described themselves as centrist.

According to a 2005 opinion poll, 66% of DS supporters thought Serbia should rely on the European Union for Serbia&#x27;s foreign policy. In opinion polls conducted prior to the 2008 elections, a majority of DS supporters declared themselves to be pro-European.

In 2012, a majority of DS voters were female, below 50 years old, and possessed a high school or university diploma. DS supporters were mostly workers, technicians, officials, and dependents. In 2014, 80% of DS supporters were female, 60% of supporters were under 50 years old, and a majority of supporters held either a high school or university diploma. In 2014, most DS supporters were tolerant of diversity and they rejected authoritarianism and nationalism. By 2016, most DS supporters were younger than 40. November 2020 research conducted by the Heinrich Böll Foundation found that supporters of DS viewed themselves as socially progressive.

== Organisation ==
, DS is led by Srđan Milivojević who was elected president in 2024. At the same party congress in December 2024, Rakić was elected deputy president, while Mitrović, Jovančićević, Nebojša Novaković, and Tijana Blagojević were elected vice-presidents. Milivojević is also the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader in the National Assembly. DS is colloquially known as &quot;žuti&quot; (yellows) due to one of its main colours.

DS has its headquarters at Nušićeva 6/II in Belgrade. From 1990 to 1998, DS put out the newspaper &quot;Demokratija,&quot; , the party has published the newspaper &quot;Bedem&quot;. Its youth wing, the Democratic Youth, has been led by Stefan Ninić . DS also operates a women&#x27;s wing called Women&#x27;s Forum. DS membership is open to every adult citizen of Serbia who is not a member of another party organisation. In December 2010, DS reported that it had 185,192 members; by 2013, the numer had increased to 196,673 members. However, only 18,459 DS members had the right to vote in the 2016 leadership election.

DS has city, local, and municipal branches, as well as a special branch in Vojvodina. DS has an assembly, a main board, a presidency, an executive board, a statutory commission—which includes the centre of departmental committees and the centre for education—a supervisory board, a political council, and an ethics committee. DS also operates the Foundation for Improving Democracy &quot;Ljuba Davidović&quot;. The main board is the highest body of DS; the president of DS represents and manages the party. Ten political parties have been formed as splits from DS: the DC, DSS, now known as the New Democratic Party of Serbia, G17+, LDP, Nova, NDS, LS, SLS, SDS, and ZZS.

=== International cooperation ===
DS has been a member of the Socialist International , and in December 2006, it became an associate member of the Party of European Socialists. According to Doris Pack, a German politician and close friend of Đinđić, Đinđić made the decision to apply to become an associate member of the Party of European Socialists; Zoran Alimpić, a senior DS official, stated that the decision came as a surprise to senior DS officials. DS is also affiliated with the Progressive Alliance. Its youth wing is a member of the Young European Socialists and a full member of the International Union of Socialist Youth. In the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, DS was associated with the Socialist Group.

In 2014, Pajtić—with Sergey Stanishev, then-president of the Party of European Socialists, Victor Ponta, then-leader of the Social Democratic Party of Romania, and Zlatko Lagumdžija, then-leader of the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina—met with Li Yuanchao, an official of the Chinese Communist Party, to discuss economic relations between China and Europe. In 2017, Šutanovac met with Zoran Zaev, the leader of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, to discuss regional cooperation, Serbia and North Macedonia&#x27;s integration into the European Union, and cooperation inside the Party of European Socialists.

<doc id="424730" wikidata="Q55111699" url="?curid=424730" title="Australian zebra finch">
<text>The Australian zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis) is the most common estrildid finch of Central Australia. It ranges over most of the continent, avoiding only the cool humid south and some areas of the tropical far north. The bird has been introduced to Puerto Rico and Portugal. Due to the ease of keeping and breeding the zebra finch in captivity, it has become Australia&#x27;s most widely studied bird; by 2010, it was the most studied captive model passerine species worldwide, by a considerable margin. 

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The Australian zebra finch was described in 1837 by John Gould as &quot;Amadina castanotis&quot;, about two decades after the Sunda zebra finch (&quot;T. guttata&quot;) was described. For over a century and a half, the Australian and Sunda zebra finches were classified as a single species, &quot;Taeniopygia guttata&quot;. They were split by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International in 2016. The International Ornithological Congress followed suit in 2022 based on studies noting differences in plumage, mtDNA divergence, and assortative mating between both species in captivity.

It is likely that the Australian zebra finch evolved first, with the Sunda zebra finch descending from Australian zebra finches blown out to sea during the Pleistocene.

==Habitat and distribution==

The Australian zebra finch has the most extensive mainland distribution of the Australian estrilids, being found in about 75% of mainland Australia. The species is generally not found on the coasts, except for the arid western edge. 

The Australian zebra finch is generally found in more arid areas. The areas it chooses to occupy are close to water, and places where rain is concentrated after it falls. However, this is likely more related to the abundance of vegetation than the abundance of water as a resource in itself. Within these areas, it is found in grasslands with scattered trees and shrubs, and in open or grassy woodlands. It is also found in cultivated areas, such as rice fields. It usually stays confined to the low coastal areas of the islands it inhabits, but it can move to elevations up to to exploit expanding cultivation and grasslands.

Although Australian zebra finch breeding, for example, is initiated by rainfall, Klaus Immelmann proposed that sustained heavy precipitation is detrimental to the zebra finch. This is supported by the observation that the nest does not shield the chicks or eggs from rain, and rainfall can sometimes result in clutches being abandoned. Furthermore, it is supported by Immelmann&#x27;s finding that zebra finches left Wyndham after the first heavy rains in November 1959, but returned to breed in April. It is hypothesised that birds in parts of northern Australia migrate inland during the wet season from October to May, and return to the coastal regions during the dryer months.

==Life cycle==
The life expectancy of an Australian zebra finch is highly variable because of genetic and environmental factors. The zebra finch may reach up to five years in its natural environment. If they are kept caged, they normally live for 5 to 9 years but may live as long as 12 years, with an exceptional case of 14.5 years reported for a caged specimen. The greatest threats to captive zebra finch survival are predation by cats and loss of natural food.

==Song and other vocalisations==
Australian zebra finches are loud and boisterous singers. Their calls can be a loud &quot;beep&quot;, &quot;meep&quot;, &quot;oi!&quot; or &quot;a-ha!&quot;. Their song is a few small beeps, leading up to a rhythmic song of varying complexity in males. Each male&#x27;s song is different, although birds of the same bloodline will exhibit similarities, and all finches will overlay their own uniqueness onto a common rhythmic framework. Due to their extremely fine temporal-auditory discrimination, the zebra finch is able to recognise and respond to micro-auditory details nested within their calls which human ears cannot detect.

Sons generally learn the song of their fathers with little variation. There is a critical sensitive period during which juvenile males learn their songs by imitating a mature, male tutor. Subsong (early, poorly structured vocalisations) evolve into &#x27;plastic song&#x27;. This plastic song is variable between renditions but begins to incorporate some recognisable elements of tutor songs. A study conducted by Nottebohm et al., has shown that birds were able to successfully imitate their tutor&#x27;s song after relatively short exposure (40 playbacks of the motifs lasting 30 seconds total) over the duration of their sensitive learning period. These birds eventually form a &quot;template&quot; of what their correct song should sound like. They rely on auditory feedback for both song learning and practice as juveniles and song maintenance as adults. Adult birds maintain their songs by correcting any deviations from their target song template. During adulthood, by around 90 days, the bird&#x27;s song goes through a crystallisation phase where their song template is stable and it no longer changes. The learning process can be delayed by exposure to traffic noise.

Male Australian zebra finches begin to sing at puberty, while females lack a singing ability. This is due to a developmental difference, where in the embryo, the male zebra finch produces testosterone, which is transformed into estradiol in the brain, which in turn leads to the development of the nervous system for a song system. There are multiple areas of the brain involved in the production of song. When a bird is singing a learned song, the HVC projects to the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which itself projects to the hypoglossal motoneurons. These motoneurons control the muscles of the trachea and syrinx. When learning a new song, the HVC sends efferents to Area X in the lobus parolfactorius, which connects to the medial nucleus of the dorsolateral thalamus (DLM). This structure connects to the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN), which projects to the RA, and continues like a normal learned song would. The function of the various areas involved in learning is still being investigated. Area X is likely involved in the acquisition of a new song, whereas the LMAN likely serves a key role in the plasticity necessary for learning. Activation of song behaviour later depends on androgens.

Because Australian zebra finch males learn their songs from their surroundings, they are often used as avian model organisms to investigate the neural bases of learning, memory, and sensorimotor integration. For example, studies have investigated the role of FoxP2 in song learning and have found that in young finches both knockdown and overexpression of FoxP2 in the striatal song control nucleus, Area X, prevents accurate song learning and tutor imitation. These studies also have implications for human speech. Individuals heterozygous for a point mutation in FOXP2 manifest a speech disorder. Because of similar expression patterns between humans and songbirds, the Australian zebra finch is used as a model to study FoxP2 expression and function. The zebra finch genome was the second bird genome to be sequenced, in 2008, after that of the chicken.

The Australian zebra finch uses an acoustic signal to communicate to embryos. It gives an incubation call to its eggs when the weather is hot—above —and when the end of their incubation period is near. This call alters the growth and behaviour of the chicks, with chicks that were given an incubation call having less mass at the end of the nestling phase when they experienced higher nest temperatures. This contrasts with chicks that were not given an incubation call, which have a higher mass at the end of nestling after being exposed to high nest temperatures. Additionally, the chicks called to as an embryo are more likely to call after experiencing high nest temperatures.

Calling behaviour is used by Australian zebra finches to negotiate parental care duties. In an experiment that delayed the return of the males to the nest, it was found that the resulting duets were shorter and calls were made more often. This is the first species that vocal negotiation over parental care has ever been reported.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
The Australian zebra finch generally breeds in loose colonies of up to 50 nests (although the number of individuals in a colony can be up to about 230 when breeding, and around 350 when not), but it may nest solitarily. It usually places its nest in a thorny shrub poor tree, although it will nest in other structures, natural and artificial. Often, there are multiple nests in one shrub.

In non-arid parts of Australia, colonies are often occupied year-round. During cold days in the non-breeding season, members of these colonies usually feed in flocks for about two hours, breaking up into small groups to rest, preen, sing, and court before foraging again in a large flock until about one hour before sunset, when they return to the colony. On warmer days, some of the small groups return to the colony to build nests and perform their normal activities. During the breeding season, finches finding or building a nest often return after about an hour of feeding, and on cold days they are joined by those incubating or brooding young. Pairs that have not yet laid their eggs sometimes elect to court and mate in special &quot;courting trees&quot; before joining the flock. In the afternoon, most pairs engage in social activities, which often take place at &quot;social trees&quot;. The zebra finch frequently does not breed where it was born; of the ringed birds that bred in the Danaher breeding colony () from 1985 to 1989, 24% of them were hatched from the colony or in the immediate vicinity. This natal dispersal is not sex-biased, unlike in most passerines. However, males between 36 and 50 days of age are more likely to disperse than females, although after this age, more females disperse than males. Predation is likely a major factor in coloniality; nests in the main colony suffer less predation than nests further away. Pairs with preyed-upon nests are significantly more likely to nest in a bush more than away from their previous nesting plant. Another large factor is where others nest: individuals are more likely to nest closer to conspecifics. In addition, reproductive success of conspecifics may play a role in where individuals nest; a study published in 2012 found that this finch was more likely to breed near nests with chicks older than six days (used as a proxy for reproductive success because they fledge about 87% of the time).

The Australian zebra finch builds both a roosting and breeding nest. The former is dome-shaped, has a large entrance on the side, and lacks an entrance tunnel. This nest helps the zebra finch conserve body heat (likely through its roof and walls and by allowing birds to huddle together): an individual in a roosting nest saves about 18% of the energy of one outside. The breeding nest (which generally ranges from about in length) has a small entrance followed by a tunnel about in diameter and up to in length, which conceals the contents of the nest, leading to the egg chamber, which has (from the outside) a diameter of ; the latter two are separated by a raised lip, preventing eggs from rolling out. This chamber often sits on an old nest; otherwise, a foundation consisting of many short, stiff stems over horizontal branches is constructed. The walls of the nest range in thickness from , with an outer layer of longer stiff and rough grass stems and an inner layer of shorter soft and fine stems. The egg chamber is also lined with soft material, such as wool and feathers. Both sites are defended during the day; but while a desperate bird is sometimes let in to the roosting nest during the night, the breeding nest is always guarded.

The Australian zebra finch is an opportunistic breeder, initiating reproductive behaviour about one to three months after water becomes available. This is so that the young hatch when semi-ripe and ripe seeds (their primary food) become available. This finding is in line with the food quality hypothesis of zebra finch breeding, which states that dry grass seed is inadequate as a food source for nestlings, and that higher quality food (like ripening seeds) is needed to sustain them. Thus, in captivity, it can breed year round when provided with sufficient water, and it may attempt to breed several times per breeding season. Zebra finches are socially monogamous, with pair bonds lasting until the death of one of the partners, after which the widowed bird re-pairs. Extra-pair copulation, mating with individuals other than one&#x27;s mate, occurs occasionally, with females usually soliciting it. Extra-pair parentage is relatively rare in the wild, accounting for about 2% of young. Attempts at forced extra-pair copulations by males occur frequently (about 43.8% of the time in one study); but, females can always successfully resist forced copulations if they so choose.
There are multiple hypotheses as to why extra-pair copulation might have evolved. One theory is the good genes theory, which states that a female chooses extra-pair copulation if the extra-pair male grants its offspring direct benefits as a result of the male&#x27;s alleles. There are results that seem to support this; a 1992 study found a correlation between the song rate of a male and the attractiveness of it (measured on the basis of how much time the female spent with the male). However, a 2007 study found that the responsiveness of a female (measured by behaviours indicating an intent to copulate or rejection) was not significantly related to the male&#x27;s beak colour or its song rate. Song rate was instead hypothesised to draw female&#x27;s attention to males. According to the author, this meant that the validity of the conclusions of the 1992 experiment needed to be reexamined. Combined with the lack of influence that certain morphological traits have, the large control of females over copulation could indicate chase-away sexual selection, where an exaggerated trait is evolved to counter increased resistance by the female to that feature. An additional theory as to why extra-pair copulation might evolve is the between-sex genetic correlation theory. This theory is based on the lack of definite female benefits in extra-pair copulations, and the benefits that males have by being promiscuous. It states that extra-pair mating behaviour could arise from the same set of loci, and thus that strong selection for extra-pair mating behaviour would indirectly select for promiscuous behaviour in females.
There are several traits correlated with increased extra-pair copulations. Spending time with a mate is important; even more important than the attractiveness of a male (as judged by other females; attractiveness as judged by one female was positively correlated with the judgements of other females). Symmetry of both plumage, like chest bands, and artificial features, like leg bands, are preferred by the female, as measured by how often the male is displayed to. Because of the prevalence of extra-pair paternity, males have evolved various mechanisms to try and assure their paternity of a clutch. The male guards its mate by following it and stopping extra-pair copulation attempts. Sperm competition, where two or more males attempt to inseminate a single egg, also occurs. This is indicated by the male in a pair copulating with its mate more often the day before egg-starts. This is because the last male to copulate with a female before the next egg has a 70% to 80% chance of fertilising the egg in question. Another adaptation to sperm competition is the male ejaculating up to seven times more sperm in extra-pair copulations. The increased amount of sperm occurs because of the combination of ejaculate size being controlled by the time between previous copulations, and the fact that extra-pair copulations occur in the male after its period of within-pair copulation period is complete.

The number of eggs ranges from two to eight eggs per clutch, with five being the most common number. These eggs are white or pale greyish blue in colour, and have a size of about . They are incubated for 14 to 16 days. From about 5% to 11% of offspring are the result of intraspecific brood parasitism, and in cases of parasitism, there is usually only one parasitic egg per nest. Additionally, parasitised nests often have one more egg than non-parasitised nests. The female may follow a mixed strategy with relation to brood parasitism (being parasitic in addition to incubating its own clutch). From about 32% to 58% of females do this, and almost all (about 96%) lay parasitic eggs before incubating their clutch. Unpaired females sometimes lay parasitic eggs, but paired females do not rely solely on parasitism. A female that parasitised a nest in the past is more likely to do so in the future. Most of these eggs are unsuccessful; that is, the host abandons its otherwise empty nest after a parasitic egg is laid. Additionally, successful parasites are more likely to have future success from parasitism. At least during late incubation, the female zebra finch can distinguish its own eggs on the basis of odour. This method of distinction arises from the visual similarity between parasitic and non-parasitic eggs, and the cost associated with raising an egg other than one&#x27;s own. When a bird is parasitised during a nesting attempt, it is less likely to be parasitised again during that season and, at the very least, during the next season (although this could be statistical noise).

Young zebra finches fledge about 17 to 18 days after hatching. They feed themselves by around 35 days after hatching, although they are still socially dependent on their parents during this time; the young become socially dependent between 36 and 50 days after hatching. They also develop sexually dimorphic plumage during this period. These finches are quick to attain sexual maturity, with most first attempting to form pair bonds and breed when they get close to 80 days in age. During the second half of the breeding season at the Danaher breeding colony, 44% of pairs attempting to breed were formed by individuals that were born earlier in the season.

Males and females are very similar in size, but are easily distinguished from one another after reaching maturity, as the males usually have bright orange cheek feathers, red beaks (as opposed to the orange beaks of females), and generally more striking black and white patterns.

====Inbreeding====
Inbreeding causes early death (inbreeding depression) in the zebra finch, although it does not seem to affect fertility. Embryos have a much lower survival rate, with a study finding fertile eggs from sibling pairs had only about a 25% survival rate, compared to about 41% for unrelated pairs. This early difference in survival eventually becomes null after fledging, with about equal survival rates for offspring from both sibling and unrelated pairs. Inbreeding depression mostly arises due to the expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

===Diet===
The zebra finch primarily eats grass seeds, feeding mostly on semi-ripe and ripe seeds (although it also takes dry seeds). The seeds are all dehusked, and are found on stems and the ground, with most being taken, at least in the nominate subspecies, from the latter. The grasses they are taken from are commonly between about in length, and larger and easily dehusked seeds are preferred. It supplements its diet with insects (mainly ants and termites) caught in short flights from lookout perches, in addition to flowers of the genus &quot;Chenopodium&quot;. The nestlings diet consists almost entirely of half-ripe and ripe seeds, in addition to green plant material. There are two main reasons why grass seeds are the dietary staple of the zebra finch: they are an abundant and relatively stable food source in this finch&#x27;s preferred climate, and they are convenient to, for example, dehusk. In some areas, such as the eastern arid zone in Australia, the seeds taken are consistent, whereas in others, like northern Victoria, there are annual changes in the diet, as different species become abundant. The diet of this finch is generally low in species diversity; at Sandringham, Queensland 74% of the seeds eaten over a 15-month period were from &quot;Panicum decompositum&quot;, for example.

The zebra finch generally forages for seeds on the ground, taking them individually. But, it also eats seeds on the heads of standing grass. To do this, it either flies and pecks out seeds one at a time, or it perches on a nearby branch. It may also take the head to the ground by jumping up and seizing it with its bill or feet. In times of scarcity, the zebra finch can use its bill to dig into the ground to find buried seed. These seeds are generally taken from patches which have fewer husks (when compared to the number of whole seeds) and are larger and more dense. A seed patch may be checked for many months after its supply of seed is depleted. Additionally, colonial roosting and nesting and foraging in flocks can help birds discover new patches of seed.

This bird commonly forages in flocks, although it sometimes forages in pairs or by itself. In the breeding season, small or medium-sized flocks are common, but in the non-breeding season, flocks of up to about 500 birds may be formed. It occasionally forms mixed-species flocks with other estrildids. A feeding flock can be formed by individuals joining those already feeding, or by individuals landing on the ground together. Birds that arrive in this flock later are more likely to rely on scrounging, or taking food from competitors, whereas early arrivals are more likely to find food for themselves. Individuals that tend to explore more may be more dominant (measured by factors such as in what order individuals accessed a food source), at least in a study that had relatively low food availability and a single source where food could be taken from. These individuals may also be less successful in a scramble competition, where there are multiple points where food can be found. The reason for the latter is hypothesised to be a result of a trade-off between faster speed in sampling an area and lower accuracy in detecting seeds.

Foraging activity in the zebra finch peaks in the first hour after sunrise and the second to last hour before sunset. In the first instance, the increase foraging is generally achieved through many short bouts of foraging, whereas the latter comes from a few long bouts. When food becomes less available, like from August to September in northern Victoria, there is more feeding in the afternoon, less time spent on patches of food before leaving, and the distance between places where food is available is longer. There are generally two groups of individuals based on foraging behaviour. In the first group, the probability of starting or stopping a feeding bout is constant through time, and short meals are more usual. Most birds in this group have longer bouts when the gap between the previous bout is longer. In the second group (which may consist of more birds), the longer a gap is, the more likely the individual is to start feeding again. Additionally, for most birds in this group, the same is true of the stopping of a bout; the longer it is, the more likely it is to be stopped. Feeding is also usually cyclical for the second group.

===Drinking and bathing===
The Australian zebra finch generally consumes about 24% to 28% of its body weight (or about ) in water per day at a temperature of . When at a higher temperature of , it may drink from of water per day. The zebra finch also extracts water from seeds, and can get water from metabolising its food. This metabolic water consumption can equal the amount of water that is lost when temperatures are below , although only for birds that are gradually dehydrated. Suddenly dehydrated birds must be in temperatures below before the water lost is equal to that produced by the metabolism. This finch can survive periods of low water consumption; one study that gradually reduced the amount of water given over a period of a few months to just per week at temperatures from found that the zebra finch could survive these conditions. Additionally, more than half of birds survived in a total water deprivation experiment that ran 513 days long.

When water is close, the Australian zebra finch drinks regularly during the day; if it is over about away, visits generally peak at midday. It prefers to drink from small puddles or other collections of water, especially those with gently sloped banks. Additionally, exposed drinking areas are preferred to more enclosed ones. It can also drink from dew on the tip of leaves. Due to the danger of predation, the zebra finch gathers in flocks in a bush or tree near a waterhole, only going to drink after the group is large enough. It then only drinks for a few seconds. After drinking, the zebra finch generally bathes for around a minute. Then, it dries off and re-oils its plumage in a warm sheltered spot.

The Australian zebra finch needs an average of only 3.6 seconds to drink of water. This short amount of time per bout is achieved by this finch&#x27;s drinking method. It swallows the water it gets while its bill tip is still submerged, unlike most birds that bring their bill tip up to swallow. This unique action is accomplished by having the tongue scoop water into the pharynx. Then, the front of the larynx forces the water into the oesophagus, which, through peristalsis, takes the fluid to the crop. This method could have evolved because the adaptations necessary were already there because of the need to quickly dehusk and swallow seeds. It allows for water to be drunk faster and taken from more diverse sources, such as drops of dew and cattle troughs; the latter requires the bird to drink upside down.

===Temperature regulation===
The body temperature (as measured from the ) of the zebra finch may vary from , rising with increasing air temperatures. Body temperatures over can cause death within an hour. This finch first cools itself by covering its plumage with water, not moving, and holding its wings out to allow more thinly feathered regions to be exposed. It also has a large capacity for evaporative cooling through the lungs and skin, with measurements of heat lost through evaporative cooling over heat produced being as high as 1.37 at . This can occur as a result of panting, which starts to occur when body temperatures reach (although this may start when the air temperature is as low as ). This can cause dehydration and may put birds into a lethargic state. Additionally, the zebra finch&#x27;s simple &quot;rete mirabile ophthalmicum&quot; (found in the head) makes it unable to cool the brain as effectively as other birds, like the common kestrel. This lacking ability to cool the brain, in combination with dehydration, may cause the mass die-offs found during prolonged periods of high temperatures. For example, in January 1932, temperatures were between for 16 days in northern Southern Australia, causing upwards of tens of thousands of this bird to die, with many being found in dams. However, so long as drinking water is available, the bird is able to tolerate heat waves on top of the usual high summer temperatures. Tolerance is also achieved through behaviour. In extreme conditions the finch will reduce its activity in the hotter parts of the day, and it is capable of predicting hotter events and will pre-emptively eat and drink in preparation for the hours of enforced inactivity.

==Predators==
Nest predators of the Australian zebra finch include the tiger snake, brown snake, dragon lizard, pygmy mulga monitor, singing honeyeater, grey-crowned babbler, yellow-throated miner, little crow, Torresian crow, black rat, and house mouse. Carnivorous marsupials are also nest predators, and barn owls take roosting adult zebra finches.

== Aviculture ==

=== Living space ===
Zebra finches can be kept in aviaries and cages. They are easy to keep and are suitable even for beginners. The minimum cage dimensions for a pair are around , with enough horizontal space for flight. The metal bars of the cage should be placed no more than ~ apart. An external aviary should have an indoor space for shelter, where the birds can sleep, rest and hide from bad weather. Because of their social nature they shouldn&#x27;t be kept alone and should at least be kept in pairs to have company. In addition to providing access to clean, fresh drinking water, zebra finches should have access to a shallow water dish for bathing.

=== Feeding ===
The zebra finch diet consists of a seed mixture for small birds. They like different kinds of millet and ears of common cereals and grasses that they can husk themselves. Another important part of their diet are fruits and vegetables, such as apples, cucumbers, grated carrots, bananas, grapes and salad, spinach and other greens. Avocado shouldn&#x27;t be given due to its toxicity to birds. An important source of minerals is crushed chicken egg shells or cuttlefish bone. Egg food is also recommended.

=== Nesting ===
For nesting, it is recommended to provide the birds with a nesting box with the dimensions and material for building the nest, such as hay and cotton. If a nest is provided, breeding will typically begin ~1 week after pairing. The female usually lays 5 eggs that are then incubated for 14 - 16 days. Young zebra finches fledge about 17 to 18 days after hatching. They feed themselves by around 35 days after hatching, although they are still socially dependent on their parents during this time; the young become socially independent between 36 and 50 days after hatching. They also develop sexually dimorphic plumage during this period. These finches are quick to attain sexual maturity, with most first attempting to form pair bonds and breed when they get close to 80 days in age.

=== Health and lifespan in captivity ===
Zebra finches can have knemicoptes mites, air sac mites, aspergillosis, coccidiosis and blood-sucking mites.

They normally live for 5 to 9 years but may live as long as 12 years or more. This depends on the quality of care, stress, and other factors.

<text>G17 Plus was a centre-right political party in Serbia. Founded as a non-governmental organization dealing with economic issues, in 2002 it transformed into a political party that became part of several ruling coalition governments in Serbia throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2013, it merged into United Regions of Serbia.

==Foundation==
G17 Plus was founded in 1997 as a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Serbia, then a federal unit within FR Yugoslavia. The organization consisting of economic experts enjoyed financial support of the United States through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

The organization was registered as a political party on 15 December 2002, with Miroljub Labus as its first president.

At its first electoral showing at the 2003 parliamentary elections, G17 Plus received 11.5% of the popular vote and 34 seats in the National Assembly.

In March 2004, G17+ formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) and New Serbia (NS). In May 2006 Miroljub Labus resigned as party leader and was replaced by Mlađan Dinkić. On October 1, 2006, the party quit the governing coalition over its failure to find and extradite ICTY fugitive Ratko Mladić.

In the 2007 elections, the party received 6.82% of the popular vote and 19 seats in the parliament.

G17+ received a single seat in the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija.

In 2010, G17 Plus founded the United Regions of Serbia (URS), a coalition of political parties and groups emphasizing decentralization and regional development of Serbia. After a few years functioning as the centerpiece of the coalition, in April 2013 G17 Plus fully merged with URS, transforming it into a political party.

In the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, G17+ was associated with the European People&#x27;s Party.

<text>In music, the mediant (&quot;Latin&quot;: &quot;being in the middle&quot;) is the third scale degree () of a diatonic scale, being the note halfway between the tonic and the dominant. In the movable do solfège system, the mediant note is sung as &quot;mi&quot;. While the fifth scale degree is almost always a perfect fifth, the mediant can be a major or minor third.

Schenkerian analysts consider the &quot;mediant&quot; (third scale degree) as an expansion or extension of the tonic since they are both common tones of the tonic chord. Thus, the third degree of a tonic triad is also the mediant iii note; furthermore, the 5th degree of the submediant chord vi is also the mediant iii note. On the other hand, in German theory derived from Hugo Riemann the mediant in major is considered the dominant parallel, Dp, and in minor the tonic parallel, tP.

In Roman numeral analysis, the mediant chord can take several forms. In major scales, the mediant chord is a minor triad and is symbolized with the Roman numeral iii. In natural minor scales, the mediant is a major triad and is symbolized with the Roman numeral III. In harmonic minor scales and ascending melodic minor scales, the seventh scale degree is raised by a half step from the subtonic b7 to the leading tone natural 7, creating an augmented triad that is symbolized with the Roman numeral bIII+ (flat III augmented).

The term &quot;mediant&quot; also refers to a relationship of musical keys. For example, relative to the key of A minor, the key of C major is the mediant, and it often serves as a mid-way point between I and V (hence the name). Tonicization or modulation to the mediant is quite common in pieces written in the minor mode and usually serves as the second theme group in sonata form since it is very easy to tonicize III in minor. Tonicization of III in major is quite rare in early classical harmony, compared with, say, modulation to the dominant V or the subdominant IV in major. It becomes more common in late Haydn and Mozart and normal by middle-period Beethoven. Mediant tonicization in major is an important feature of Romantic music.

<doc id="424734" wikidata="Q648211" url="?curid=424734" title="Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro">
<text>The Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (, DPS) is a social democratic and populist political party in Montenegro. A former long-time ruling party sitting at the opposition for the first time since 2020, it was formed on 22 June 1991 as the successor of the League of Communists of Montenegro, which had governed Montenegro within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since World War II, and has remained a major force in the country ever since. The party is a member of the Socialist International and the Progressive Alliance, and an associate of the Party of European Socialists. During the 1990s, DPS was the major centre-left, social-democratic party in favour of Serbian–Montenegrin unionism. However, since 1997, the party has embraced Montenegrin independence and has been improving ties with the West, slowly turning into a catch-all party embracing Atlanticism, Montenegrin nationalism, neoliberalism, and pro-Europeanism.

Since its formation and the introduction of a multi-party system, the DPS has played a dominant role in Montenegrin politics, forming the backbone of every coalition government until the 2020 parliamentary election, when it entered the opposition. This marked the first time since 1945 that the party, including its predecessor incarnation, had not been in power. Prior to the 2020 election, the party strongly supported the controversial religious freedom law, causing tensions across Montenegro and the rise of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegrin politics. The Church gaining more power gave motivation for the ethnic nationalist faction to rise in the party, with which some members such as the civic nationalist Filip Vujanović had issues since 2011. The ethnic nationalist wing of the party also supported renewing the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which led to the DPS being accused of creating a &quot;party church&quot;.

== Ideology ==
The party evolved from the League of Communists of Montenegro as a reformist force after Yugoslavia&#x27;s dissolution. In the 1990s, party was based on democratic socialism, social democracy, and Serbian–Montenegrin unionism. In the 2000s, the party switched policy towards a common state with Serbia and would become the main proponent of the independence of Montenegro in 2006. In the 2010s and 2020s, the party is characterized by populist, big tent politics with a slight centre-left lean, alongside elements of nationalism and a pro-European stance towards European integration. The PDS also followed most mainstream, centre-left, social-democratic parties moving to the right since the 1980s, as a result of the post-war displacement of Keynesianism, by embracing Third Way economics and politics but has been described as one of the most radical neoliberal centre-left parties. Many considered the party and its three decade rule to have been, in practice, a kleptocratic and authoritarian regime.

After its ninth congress in November 2019, the DPS dominantly increased its ethnic Montenegrin nationalist discourse by officially and institutionally supporting the rights of the canonically unrecognized Montenegrin Orthodox Church, announcing its &quot;re-establishment&quot;. According to the ODIHR and Freedom House reports that the party established a hybrid regime as well an electoral authoritarian system. After the fall of its populist regime from the position of power after 30 years due to results of the 2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election, the party said that the Krivokapić Cabinet, a big tent ruling coalition, represents &quot;threat for Montenegrin statehood and its independence&quot;. The period before the 2020 parliamentary election was marked by the high polarization of the electorate. Several corruption scandals of the ruling party triggered 2019 Montenegrin anti-corruption protests, while a controversial religion law sparked another wave of protests. Election monitoring observer OSCE stated that &quot;[a]buse of state resources gave the ruling party an unfair advantage&quot; and of inciting ethnic hatred, and said that although the elections were competitive, the governing party also benefited from a lack of independent media. 
In foreign policy, the party maintains Atlanticist and Europeanist positions, condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine and positioning itself in an anti-Russian role.
According to some analysts, the DPS, together with its coalition partners, as well some newly founded nationalist parties, started pushing the narrative of &quot;Montenegro being left to Serbia by the United States and the EU&quot;, but these assessments have no foundation in the post-Ukrainian invasion international scenario.

== History ==
=== Background ===

The history of the DPS begins with the political turmoil in Yugoslavia in the late 1980s. After Slobodan Milošević seized power in the League of Communists of Serbia, he went on to organize rallies that eventually ousted the leaderships of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia local branches in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro. This series of events, collectively known as the Anti-bureaucratic revolution, swept into power new party leadership in Montenegro, one allied with Milošević, personified in Momir Bulatović, Milo Đukanović, and Svetozar Marović.
Under this new leadership, the League of Communists of Montenegro won by a landslide in the 1990 Montenegrin general election, the first relatively free multi-party election in Socialist Montenegro, held in December 1990, taking 83 out of 125 seats in the Parliament of Montenegro. The party had a significant head start in the elections, as it had the entire established party structure at its disposal, while newly formed competition had to start from scratch. The party changed its name to the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (&quot;Demokratska partija Crne Gore&quot;) on 22 June 1991.

With Bulatović as the president, the DPS closely aligned Montenegro with Serbia and the policies of Slobodan Milošević. The party was firmly in power during the turbulent early 1990s, which saw the breakup of Yugoslavia and the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars. During these years, the party endorsed a union and close relations with Serbia, its sole partner in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) from 1992. The party maintained the support of the electorate in this difficult period for Montenegro, winning both the 1992–1993 and 1996 parliamentary elections.

=== Split between Bulatović and Đukanović ===

On July 11, 1997, the party&#x27;s national committee &quot;Glavni odbor&quot; (GO) held a closed doors session after which the committee selected Milica Pejanović-Đurišić to replace Bulatović as the party president. The party split had enormous implications, making a political confrontation between Đukanović and Bulatović inevitable. This manifested in the 1997 Montenegrin presidential election held in October, which Đukanović won by a thin margin. Bulatović went on to form the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro (SNP) out of his defeated DPS faction, whose platform held a unionist position on the question of Yugoslavia and its short-lived successor state, Serbia and Montenegro. Meanwhile, Đukanović became a fierce opponent of Slobodan Milošević politics.

As a result of Đukanović&#x27;s relationship with the United States, Montenegro received significant amounts of economic aid during this period, and negotiated limitations on NATO bombings of its territory in 1999, whereas the rest of Yugoslavia was subject to significantly heavier attacks. The DPS government gradually severed ties with Serbia by taking control over customs and the economy, introducing first the Deutsche mark, and subsequently the euro as legal tender, and generally reducing the influence of the federal government in Montenegro.

=== Montenegrin independence ===
Following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević on 5 October 2000, the DPS showed signs of greater support for Montenegrin independence. The campaign for the 2002 parliamentary elections was devoted to the question of Montenegro&#x27;s independence. The European Union mediated negotiations between the DPS and the newly elected democratic government in Serbia in 2003 imposed a three-year waiting period before an independence referendum could be held. The transitional period saw the transformation of the FR Yugoslavia to a loose union called Serbia and Montenegro. During the existence of the union state, the party congress added the goal of a &quot;democratic, internationally-recognized, independent Montenegro&quot; to its official platform. The party then spearheaded the pro-independence campaign ahead of Montenegro&#x27;s referendum in 2006. With 55.5% of voters opting for independence, Montenegro became an independent state on 3 June 2006.

=== Post-referendum era ===

At the 2006 Montenegrin parliamentary election as well as the subsequent 2009 and 2012 parliamentary elections, the DPS confirmed its position as the strongest political party in Montenegro. The party has formed the basis of all parliamentary majorities and has been the backbone of all government cabinets since independence, usually with its now traditional ally the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro and ethnic minority parties. Former party vice-president Filip Vujanović served as the president of Montenegro for three terms from 2002 until 2018, having won presidential elections in 2003, 2008, and 2013, being succeeded by party leader Milo Đukanović in 2018.

Đukanović remains the party president and its undisputed authority, serving either as Prime Minister or President of Montenegro from 1991 to 2006, 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2016. In 2006, the party leadership chose Željko Šturanović, former Minister of Justice, to succeed Đukanović as Prime Minister, until his resignation on 31 January 2008 for health reasons, whereupon Đukanović replaced him, only to resign again in December 2010 while retaining his role as DPS party leader. After winning the 2012 parliamentary elections, Đukanović once again assumed the position of Prime Minister. In 2015, the centre-left Social Democratic Party left the coalition with the DPS, accusing ruling party of corruption and abuse of power. At the 2020 parliamentary election, DPS decided to run independently, with single candidate spot on the electoral list given to the nationalist Liberal Party of Montenegro. Election eventually resulted in a victory for the opposition parties and the fall of the authoritarian DPS, after governing the country for 30 years, since the introduction of the multi-party system in 1990. In December 2024, several former ministers and high-ranking officials from the ranks of the DPS were arrested and charged with embezzlement and corruption.

<text>The Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro () is a political party in Montenegro. It is a social-democratic and socially conservative party, that is positioned on the centre-left on the political spectrum with regard to economic matters. It is supportive of accession of Montenegro to the European Union, and was historically supportive of Serbian–Montenegrin unionism.

==History==
===Origins===
In the late 1990s a rift inside the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro came out. In the 1997 Montenegrin presidential election, aside from the then-President of the Republic and the Party Momir Bulatović, the Premier of Montenegro and party vice-president Milo Đukanović ran too, leading a reforming wing opposing mainstream DPS CG&#x27;s political attitudes regarding support of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević. The ruling parties of the Republic of Serbia (the constitutive partner of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia like the Republic of Montenegro), SPS and SRS, soundly and firmly stood on Momir Bulatović&#x27;s side, while the opposition in Serbia (SPO, DS, DSS and GS) gave their support for Đukanović. It is so that the DPS — Momir Bulatović had officially seceded from the other branch of the DPS, but Bulatović&#x27;s supporters had only retained a majority in 5 municipalities, while the other 16 in which DPS reigned voiced their support of Đukanović.

Momir presented in the political campaign that his main goal was the preservation of the FRY and the maintaining of the present political status in Montenegro. In the first round on 5 October 1997 Momir Bulatović won receiving most votes, 147,615 or 47.45%, but lost to opposing Milo in the second round on 19 October 1997 when he won 169,257 or only 49.2%. Momir refused to recognize the results, calling them unrealistic and forged — considering that every single of the other candidates that ran in the first round voiced their support for in Momir in the second. One of the main controversial moments, as criticized by OEBS, is that Milo as Premier, managed to seize control of the Montenegrin national media (e.g. TV CG). On the other side, the Serbian national media had also been unbalanced, promoting Momir. The other unbalancing issue is that Milo, as Premier, was in a much stronger position to further his personal goals, controlling the government (the President had very little authority in effect) and had seized control over most of DPS&#x27; local authorities, while &quot;Democratic Party of Socialists — Momir Bulatović&quot; got only 5 of total DPS&#x27; 21.

On the other hand, Momir enjoyed the support of Serbia and the Federal Yugoslav government itself. With the huge clashes between Momir and Milo, the election respected minimal democratic standards. However, with eventual loss at the election, the rift between the two wings was final.

===First period===
By 2000, Milošević began to lose his ground in Serbia, and it became apparent that he no longer had support either within the international community or his own country. However, Momir Bulatović was still a close ally of Milošević, and that fact led to a split within the SNP on whether to stay loyal to Milošević or to become a party with a more democratic image. In 2001 the pro-European and democratic wing led by Predrag Bulatović prevailed and he became SNP&#x27;s president. The party continued to be a proponent of the union with Serbia, while the old-style pro-Milošević faction of politicians formed the People&#x27;s Socialist Party under Momir Bulatović.

===Second period===

As some ethnic Serb parties took advantage of the SNP&#x27;s new orientation and attracted some voters, SNP became the strongest opposition party in Montenegro. It was the leader of the &quot;Movement for European Union of Serbia and Montenegro&quot;, which eventually failed to preserve the union with Serbia. SNP avoided to explicitly state its rejection of the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum results, but it refused to attend the country&#x27;s inauguration ceremonies. Other pro-union opposition parties openly refused to recognize the results. 

In the first parliamentary elections in independent Montenengro, SNP saw the largest downfall of the number of its voters since the founding of the party. The coalition it had led in 2002 elections fell from 30 to 11 seats in the Montenegrin parliament. SNP lost its status of leader of Montenegrin opposition in favour of the Serbian List led by the Serbian People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro (12 seats) and Movement for Changes (11 seats). This resulted in resignation of party&#x27;s leader Predrag Bulatović, as well as the three vice-presidents.

===Third period===
On 27 December 2006, Srđan Milić was announced new party president, after gaining the majority of General Party Congress votes, and beating the other two candidates, Dragiša Pešić and Borislav Globarević, representing the victory of the expressly pro-EU program. SNP CG adopted a strongly civic social-democratic political course and broke off the traditional coalition with the People&#x27;s Party and the Democratic Serb Party.
In the negotiations for the new Montenegrin Constitution, SNP forged a united political alliance of practically the entire Opposition with the Movement for Changes, both of its old partners the People&#x27;s Party and Democratic Serb Party, the members of the Serb List alliance, the Bosniak Party and the ethnic Albanian Democratic League in Montenegro and Albanian Alternative with a united platform, preparing to boycott the referendum. However, NS, DSS, DSCG and SL retreated from negotiations with the opposition. On the other hand, PzP, BS and AA accepted independently from the alliance terms of the ruling coalition and are ready to give the required super-majority to adopt the constitution. SNP submitted 33 amendments and still did not include the option to support the constitution as well, under the condition that its amendments — previously included in the Opposition&#x27;s demands — were adopted.

The reforms of Srđan Milić worked well for SNP, as in the 2009 Montenegrin parliamentary election it won 16 seats in the Parliament of Montenegro, becoming once again the biggest sole opposition party.

Before the 2012 Montenegrin parliamentary election the right-wing faction of the party led by their former president Predrag Bulatović left the party and joined the Democratic Front alliance. In the election, the party ran independently and won only 11.06% of the votes, and 9 seats.

In February 2015, the party faction led by Aleksa Bečić split from the SNP due to disagreements with party leader Milić, having decided to form a new political party, Democratic Montenegro.

In September 2016, SNP decided to enter the Key Coalition with DEMOS and URA in order to participate at the forthcoming parliamentary election. The Coalition was the third-ranked electoral list with 11.05% of the votes and 9 seats, out of which SNP won only 3. Some time afterwards, member Aleksandar Damjanović left the parliamentary group.

===Fourth period===
Party president Srđan Milić tendered his resignation after 11 years of leading the party for a catastrophically poor result at the 2016 parliamentary elections. Vladimir Joković, supported by the party faction led by former president of the party parliamentary club Aleksandar Damjanović and current mayor of Berane Dragoslav Šćekić, was surprisingly elected President of the party at the General Congress held on 13 August 2017, in front of favored Snežana Jonica, supported by the fraction close to former party leader Milić. In mid-2019, the centre-left party faction led by Jonica split from the SNP due to ideological disagreements with the new party leadership, having decided to form a new political group, Socialists of Montenegro (Socijalisti Crne Gore, SCG).

On 1 May 2019 SNP signed an agreement with the Independent parliamentary group of Parliament of Montenegro composed of United Montenegro (UCG), Workers&#x27; Party (RP) and two independent MPs, including former SNP high-ranking member &quot;Aleksandar Damjanović&quot;, forming new catch-all alliance named For the Benefit of All. The alliance eventually dissolved prior the parliamentary election in August 2020, and all three parties decided to join a pre-election coalition with right-wing Democratic Front (DF) alliance, under the name For the Future of Montenegro, employing a more significant cultural and socially conservative discourse, supporting 2019–2020 clerical protests in Montenegro and Serbian Orthodox Church rights in Montenegro.

With the end of the Krivokapić government, the party took part in the new government led by Dritan Abazović.

<doc id="424739" wikidata="Q600571" url="?curid=424739" title="Abuse">
<text>Abuse is the act of improper usage or treatment of a person or thing, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression. To these descriptions, one can also add the Kantian notion of the wrongness of using another human being as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves. Some sources describe abuse as &quot;socially constructed&quot;, which means there may be more or less recognition of the suffering of a victim at different times and societies.

==Types and contexts of abuse==

===Abuse of authority===

Abuse of authority includes harassment, interference, pressure, and inappropriate requests or favors.

===Abuse of corpse===
Necrophilia involves possessing a physical attraction to dead bodies that may led to acting upon sexual urges. As corpses are dead and cannot give consent, any manipulation, removal of parts, mutilation, or sexual acts performed on a dead body is considered abuse.

===Abuse of discretion===

An abuse of discretion is a failure to take into proper consideration, the facts and laws relating to a particular matter; an arbitrary or unreasonable departure from precedent and settled judicial custom.

===Abuse of dominance===

Market dominance by companies is regulated by public and private enforcement of competition law, also known as antitrust or anti-monopoly law. These laws stop companies from doing things that hurt customers or block fair competition. For example, Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibits companies in a dominant market position from abusing their power, such as through unfair pricing, limiting production, or refusing to deal with others.

===Abuse of indulgences===

In the Catholic Church, an indulgence is a way to reduce punishment for sin, often by prayer, pilgrimage or good works. In the Middle Ages, some Church officials demanded money in exchange both for forgiveness of sins and for other rewards such as future salvation.

===Abuse of information===

Abuse of information typically involves a breach of confidence or plagiarism, or extending the confidence of information beyond those authorised.

In the financial world, Insider trading can also be considered a misuse of internal information that gives an unfair advantage in investment.

===Abuse of power===

Abuse of power, in the form of &quot;malfeasance in office&quot; or &quot;official misconduct&quot;, is the commission of an unlawful act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties. Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a for cause removal of an elected official by statute or recall election.

===Abuse of process===

A cause of action in tort arising from one party making a malicious and deliberate misuse or perversion of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action.

===Abuse of rank===

Rankism (also called abuse of rank) is treating people of a lower rank in an abusive, discriminatory, or exploitative way. Robert W. Fuller claims that rankism includes the abuse of the power inherent in superior rank, with the view that rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as bullying, racism, sexism, and homophobia.

===Abuse of statistics===
===Abuse of trust===
===Abusive supervision===

Abusive supervision is most commonly studied in the context of the workplace, although can arise in other areas such as in the household and at school. &quot;Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome&quot;. &quot;Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors&quot;. The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events.

===Academic abuse===

Academic abuse is a form of workplace bullying which takes place in institutions of higher education, such as colleges and universities. Academia is highly competitive and has a well defined hierarchy, with junior staff being particularly vulnerable.

===Adolescent abuse===
===Adult abuse===
Adult abuse refers to the abuse of vulnerable adults.

===Alcohol use disorder===

Alcohol use disorder, as described in the DSM-IV, is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of alcoholic beverages despite its negative consequences. Alcohol use disorder is sometimes referred to by the less specific term alcoholism. There are two types of people with alcohol use disorder: those who have anti-social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking for long periods of time but are unable to control themselves once they start. Binge drinking is another form of alcohol use disorder. Frequent binge drinking or getting severely drunk more than twice is classed as alcohol misuse. According to research done through international surveys, the heaviest drinkers happen to be the United Kingdom&#x27;s adolescent generation.

===Animal abuse===
Animal abuse is the infliction of suffering or harm upon animals, other than humans, for purposes other than self-defense. More narrowly, it can be harm for specific gain, such as killing animals for fur. Diverging viewpoints are held by jurisdictions throughout the world.

===Anti-social behavior===
Anti-social behavior is often seen as public behavior that lacks judgement and consideration for others and may damage them or their property. It may be intentional, as with vandalism or graffiti, or the result of negligence. Persistent anti-social behavior may be a manifestation of an antisocial personality disorder. The counterpart of anti-social behavior is pro-social behavior, namely any behavior intended to help or benefit another person, group or society.

===Bullying===
Bullying is repeated acts over time that involves a real or perceived imbalance of power with the more powerful individual or group attacking those who are less powerful. Bullying may consist of three basic types of abuse – verbal, physical and emotional. It typically involves subtle methods of coercion such as intimidation. Bullying can be defined in many different ways. Although the UK currently has no legal definition of bullying, some US states have laws against it. Bullying is usually done to coerce others by fear or threat.

===Character assassination===

Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person&#x27;s reputation. It may involve exaggeration or manipulation of facts to present an untrue picture of the targeted person. It is a form of defamation and can be a form of an ad hominem (to the person) argument.

=== Child abuse===
Child abuse is the physical or psychological/emotional mistreatment of children. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. Most child abuse occurs in a child&#x27;s home, with a smaller amount occurring in the organisations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological/emotional abuse, and sexual abuse.

====Child sexual abuse====
Child sexual abuse is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation. Different forms of this include: asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities (regardless of the outcome), some types of indecent exposure of genitalia to a child, displaying pornography to a child, actual sexual contact against a child, viewing or engaging in physical contact with the child&#x27;s genitals for sexual purposes, or using a child to produce child pornography.

=====Child-on-child sexual abuse=====

Child-on-child sexual abuse refers to a form of child sexual abuse in which a prepubescent child is sexually abused by one or more other children or adolescent youths, and in which no adult is directly involved. This includes sexual activity between children that occurs without consent, without equality, or as a result of coercion; particularly when physical force, threats, trickery, or emotional manipulation are used to elicit co-operation.

===Civil rights abuse===
===Clandestine abuse===

Clandestine abuse is sexual, psychological, or physical abuse &quot;that is kept secret for a purpose, concealed, or underhanded.&quot;

===Clerical abuse===
=== Cyber abuse or cyber bullying===
Cyberbullying &quot;involves the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behavior by an individual or group, that is intended to harm others.&quot; -Bill Belsey

===Dating abuse or dating violence===
Dating abuse is a pattern of abusive behaviour exhibited by one or both partners in a dating relationship. The behaviour may include, but is not limited to; physical abuse; psychological abuse; and sexual abuse.

===Defamation===
Defamation is the communication of a statement that makes a claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual, business, product, group, government or nation a negative image. It is usually – but not always, a requirement that this claim be false and that the publication be communicated to someone other than the person defamed (termed the claimant).

===Disability abuse===

It has been noted that disabled people are disproportionately affected by disability abuse and bullying, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime. The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled – such as wheelchair-users or individuals with physical differences (e.g., cleft lip) – but also those with learning disabilities, autism or developmental coordination disorder. In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an ignorant physical education teacher. Abuse of disabled people is not limited to schools; there are many known cases in which disabled people have been abused by staff of a &quot;care institution&quot;, such as the case revealed in a BBC Panorama programme on a Castlebeck care home (Winterbourne View) near Bristol, leading to its closure and suspension or firing of staff members.

===Discriminatory abuse===

Discriminatory abuse involves picking on or treating someone unfairly because something about them is different; for example concerning:
Discriminatory laws such as redlining have existed in many countries. In some countries, controversial attempts such as racial quotas have been used to redress negative effects of discrimination.

Other acts of discrimination include political libel, defamation of groups and stereotypes based on exaggerations.

=== Domestic abuse or domestic violence===
Domestic abuse can be broadly defined as any form of abusive behaviours by one or both partners in an intimate relationship, such as marriage, cohabitation, family, dating, or even friends.
Domestic violence has many forms, including:
* physical aggression (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, throwing objects), or threats thereof
* sexual abuse
* emotional abuse
* financial abuse (withholding money or controlling all money, including that of other family members)
* social abuse (restricting access to friends or family, insulting or threatening friends or family), controlling or domineering
* intimidation
* stalking
* passive/covert abuse (e.g., neglect)
* economic deprivation
Depending on local statues, the domestic violence may or may not constitute a crime, also depending on the severity and duration of specific acts, and other variables. Alcohol consumption and mental illness have frequently been associated with abuse.

===Economic abuse===

Economic abuse is a form of abuse when one intimate partner has control over the other partner&#x27;s access to economic resources, which diminishes the victim&#x27;s capacity to support him/herself and forces him/her to depend on the perpetrator financially.

===Elder abuse===

Elder abuse is a type of harm to older adults involving abuse by trusted individuals in a manner that &quot;causes harm or distress to an older person&quot;. This definition has been adopted by the World Health Organization from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. The abuse includes violence, neglect, and other crimes committed against an elderly person and their forms include physical, mental, and financial abuses as well as passive and active neglect.

===Emotional abuse===
While there is an absence of consensus as to the precise definition of emotional abuse, it is classified by the U.S. federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act as a form of mental injury. The typical legal definition, particularly in the area of child welfare, accepted by the majority of U.S. states describes it as injury to the psychological cap|acity or emotional stability as evidenced by an observable or substantial change in behavior, emotional response or cognition.

===Employee abuse===
===False accusations===

False accusations (or false allegations) can be in any of the following contexts:
* informally in everyday life;
* quasi-judicially;
* judicially.

===Flag abuse===

Flag abuse (or flag desecration) is a term applied to various acts that intentionally destroy, damage or mutilate a flag in public, most often a national flag. Often, such action is intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country&#x27;s own national flag and flags of other countries. Countries may have laws protecting the right to burn a flag as free speech.

=== Gaming the system===

Gaming the system (also called bending the rules, gaming the rules, playing the system, abusing the system, milking the system, or working the system) can be defined as using the rules and procedures meant to protect a system to instead manipulate the system for a desired outcome.

===Gaslighting===

Gaslighting is manipulation through persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying in an attempt to destabilize and delegitimize a target. Its intent is to sow seeds of doubt in the targets, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to &quot;Gaslight&quot;, a 1938 play and 1944 film, and has been used in clinical and research literature.

=== Gay abuse or gay bashing===

Gay bashing and gay bullying are verbal or physical abuse against a person perceived by the aggressor to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual, including people who are actually heterosexual, or of non-specific or unknown sexual orientation.

===Harassment===
Harassment covers a wide range of offensive behaviour. It is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset. In the legal sense, it is behaviour which &quot;is found&quot; threatening or disturbing.

Power harassment is harassment or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace.

Sexual harassment refers to persistent and unwanted sexual advances, typically in the workplace, where the consequences of refusing sexual requests are potentially very disadvantageous to the victim.

===Hate crimes===
Hate crimes occur when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a certain social group; usually defined by racial group, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender, gender identity, or political affiliation.

&quot;Hate crime&quot; generally refers to criminal acts which are seen to have been motivated by hatred of one or more of the listed conditions. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or inflammatory letters (hate mail).

===Hazing===

Hazing is considered any activity involving harassment, abuse, or humiliation as a way of initiating a person into a group.

Hazing is seen in many different types of groups; including within gangs, clubs, sports teams, military units, and s. In the United States and Canada, hazing is often associated with Greek-letter organisations (fraternities and sororities). Hazing is often prohibited by law and may be either physical (possibly violent) or mental (possibly ) practices. It may also include nudity or sexually oriented activities.

===Human rights abuse===
Human rights are &quot;basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled.&quot; Examples of rights and freedoms which have come to be commonly thought of as human rights include civil and political rights, such as the right to life and liberty, freedom of expression, and equality before the law; and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to participate in culture, the right to be treated with respect and dignity, the right to food, the right to work, and – in certain countries – the right to education.

===Humiliation===

Humiliation is the abasement of pride, which creates mortification or leads to a state of being humbled or reduced to lowliness or submission. It can be brought about through bullying, intimidation, physical or mental mistreatment or trickery, or by embarrassment if a person is revealed to have committed a socially or legally unacceptable act.

===Incivility===
Incivility is a general term for social behaviour lacking in civility or good manners, ranging from rudeness or lack of respect towards elders; vandalism and hooliganism; or public drunkenness and threatening behaviour.

===Institutional abuse===
Institutional abuse can typically occur in a care home, nursing home, acute hospital or in-patient setting and can be any of the following:

===Insult===
An insult is an expression, statement or behaviour considered to be degrading and offensive.

===Intimidation===
Intimidation involves intentional behavior that would cause a person of reasonable apprehension to fear harm or injury. Within the context of a criminal prosecution it is not necessary to prove that the behavior caused the victim to experience or panic. &quot;The calculated use of violence or the threat of violence to attain goals political, religious, or ideological in nature... through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear&quot; can be defined as terrorism.

===Legal abuse===

Legal abuse refers to abuses associated with both civil and criminal legal action.

===Market abuse===
Market abuse may arise in circumstances where financial investors have been unreasonably disadvantaged, directly or indirectly, by others who:
* have used information which is not publicly available (insider dealing)
* have distorted the price-setting mechanism of financial instruments
* have disseminated false or misleading information.

===Medical abuse===
===Military abuse===

&quot;War crimes&quot; are &quot;violations of the laws or customs of war&quot;, including &quot;murder, the ill-treatment or deportation of civilian residents of an occupied territory to slave labor camps&quot;, &quot;the murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war&quot;, the killing of hostages, &quot;the wanton destruction of cities, towns and villages, and any devastation not justified by military, or civilian necessity&quot;.

&quot;War rape&quot; is rape committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war. During war and armed conflict rape is frequently used as means of psychological warfare to humiliate the enemy and undermine their morale.

&quot;Military sexual trauma&quot; is sexual assault and rape experienced by military personnel. It is often accompanied by posttraumatic stress disorder.

===Mind abuse or mind control===
Mind abuse or mind control refers to a process in which a group or individual &quot;systematically uses unethically manipulative methods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the manipulator(s), often to the detriment of the person being manipulated&quot;. The term has been applied to any tactic, psychological or otherwise, which can be seen as subverting an individual&#x27;s sense of control over their own thinking, behaviour, emotions or decision making.

===Misconduct===
Misconduct means a wrongful, improper, or unlawful conduct motivated by premeditated or intentional purpose or by obstinate indifference to the consequences of one&#x27;s acts. Three categories of misconduct are &quot;official misconduct&quot;, &quot;professional misconduct &quot;and &quot;sexual misconduct&quot;.

===Mobbing===

Mobbing means bullying of an individual by a group in any context. Identified as emotional abuse in the workplace (such as &quot;ganging up&quot; on someone by co-workers, subordinates or superiors) to force someone out of the workplace through rumour, innuendo, intimidation, humiliation, discrediting, and isolation, it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial, general harassment.

Mobbing can take place in any group environment such as a workplace, neighbourhood or family.

===Narcissistic abuse===

Narcissistic abuse is a term that emerged in the late 20th century, and became more prominent in the 2000s decade. It originally referred specifically to abuse by narcissistic parents of their children, but more recently has come to mean any abuse by a narcissist (egotistical person or someone with arrogant pride).

===Neglect===
Neglect is a passive form of abuse in which a caregiver responsible for providing care for a victim (a child, a physically or mentally disabled adult, an animal, a plant, or an inanimate object) fails to provide adequate care for the victim&#x27;s needs, to the detriment of the victim. It is typically seen as a form of laziness or apathy on the form of the caregiver, rather than ignorance due to inability; accordingly, neglect of a child by and adult with mental disorders or who is overworked is not considered abuse, although this may constitute child neglect nonetheless.

Examples of neglect include failing to provide sufficient supervision, nourishment, medical care or other needs for which the victim is helpless to provide for themselves.

=== Negligence===
Negligence is conduct that is culpable (to blame) because it falls short of what a reasonable person would do to protect another individual from foreseeable risks of harm.

===Parental abuse by children===

Abuse of parents by their children is a common but under-reported and under-researched subject. Parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression, typically in the form of verbal or physical abuse, in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts. Parents feel a sense of shame and humiliation to have that problem, so they rarely seek help; nor is much help available today.

===Passive–aggressive behaviour===
Passive–aggressive behaviour is a form of covert abuse. It is passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to following through with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations.
It can manifest itself as learned helplessness, procrastination, stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate and repeated failures in accomplishing tasks for which one is (often explicitly) expected to do.

=== Patient abuse===
Patient abuse or neglect is any action or failure to act which causes unreasonable suffering, misery or harm to the patient. It includes physically striking or sexually assaulting a patient. It also includes withholding of necessary food, physical care, and medical attention. It applies to various contexts such as hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and home visits.

===Peer abuse===
&quot;Peer abuse&quot; is an expression popularised by author Elizabeth Bennett in 2006 to reinforce the idea that it is as valid to identify bullying as a form of abuse just as one would identify any other form of abuse. The term conveys similar connotations to the term &quot;peer victimisation&quot;.

===Persecution===
Persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another group. The most common forms are religious persecution, ethnic persecution, and political persecution; though there is naturally some overlap between these terms.

===Physical abuse===

Physical abuse is abuse involving contact intended to cause feelings of intimidation, pain, injury, or other physical suffering or bodily harm.

====Torture====
Torture is any act by which severe pain, whether physical or psychological, is intentionally inflicted.

===Police abuse===

&quot;Police brutality&quot; is the intentional use of excessive force by a police officer. Though usually physical it has the potential to arise in the form of verbal attacks or psychological intimidation. It is in some instances triggered by &quot;contempt of cop&quot;, i.e., perceived disrespect towards police officers.

&quot;Police corruption&quot; is a specific form of police misconduct designed to obtain financial benefits or career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing, or selectively pursuing, an investigation or arrest.

&quot;Police misconduct&quot; refers to inappropriate actions taken by police officers in connection with their official duties. Police misconduct can lead to a miscarriage of justice and sometimes involves discrimination.

===Political abuse===

===Prejudice===

A prejudice is a preconceived belief, opinion, or judgment toward a group of people or a single person because of race, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, line of work or other personal characteristics. It also means a priori beliefs (without knowledge of the facts) and includes &quot;any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence.&quot; Although positive and negative prejudice both exist, when used negatively, &quot;prejudice&quot; implies fear and antipathy toward such a group or person.

=== Prison abuse or prisoner abuse===
Prisoner abuse is the mistreatment of persons while they are under arrest or incarcerated.
Abuse falling into this category includes:
* Physical abuse: hitting, beating, or other unauthorised corporal punishment.
* Psychological abuse: taunting, sleep deprivation, or other forms of psychological abuse, occasionally white noise
* Sexual abuse: forced intercourse, genital mutilation, or other forms of sexual abuse.
* Other abuse: refusal of essential medication, humiliation, etc.
* Enhanced interrogation: methods implemented in the War on Terror purportedly needed to extract information since other techniques would not yield results.
* Torture: any act by which severe pain, whether physical or psychological, is intentionally inflicted

===Professional abuse===
Professional abusers:
* take advantage of their client or patient&#x27;s trust
* exploit their vulnerability
* do not act in their best interests
* fail to keep professional boundaries

Abuse may be:

===Psychological abuse===
Psychological abuse, also referred to as emotional abuse or mental abuse, is a form of abuse characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another to behavior that is psychologically harmful. Such abuse is often associated with situations of power imbalance, such as abusive relationships, bullying, child abuse and in the workplace.

===Racial abuse===

Racism is abusive attitudes or treatment of others based on the belief that race is a primary determinant of human traits and capacities. It is a form of pride that one&#x27;s own race is superior and, as a result, has a right to &quot;rule or dominate others&quot;, according to a &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; definition. Racism is correlated with and can foster race-based prejudice, violence, dislike, discrimination, and oppression.

===Ragging===
Ragging is a form of abuse on newcomers to educational institutions in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. It is similar to the American phenomenon known as hazing. Currently, Sri Lanka is said to be its worst affected country in the world.

===Rape===
Rape, a form of sexual assault, is an assault by a person involving sexual intercourse (with or without sexual penetration) of another without the other&#x27;s consent (this includes those who are considered unable to consent, e.g., if they were inebriated or asleep)

The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions. The US Bureau of Justice Statistics (1999) estimated that 91% of US rape victims are female and 9% are male, with 99% of the offenders being male. In one survey of women, only two percent of respondents who stated they were sexually assaulted said that the assault was perpetrated by a stranger. For men, male-male rape in prisons has been a significant problem.

===Relational aggression===

Relational aggression, also known as covert aggression or covert bullying is a type of aggression in which harm is caused through damage to relationships or social status within a group rather than physical violence. Relational aggression is more common and has been studied more among girls than boys.

===Religious abuse===
Religious abuse refers to:
* use of religious teachings in an abusive manner that causes psychological harm
* harassment or humiliation on the basis of the victim&#x27;s religion, (see religious discrimination)
* misuse of a religion for selfish, secular or ideological ends, see

** abuse of a clerical position to perpetrate non-religiously motivated abuse, such as in the Catholic sex abuse cases
* any form of religious violence, including:
** human sacrifice
** violent initiation rites

===Rudeness===

Rudeness (also called impudence or effrontery) is the disrespect and failure to behave within the context of a society or a group of people&#x27;s social laws or etiquette.

===Satanic ritual abuse===

Satanic ritual abuse (SRA, sometimes known as ritual abuse, ritualistic abuse, organised abuse, sadistic ritual abuse and other variants) was a moral panic that originated in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout the country and eventually to many parts of the world, before subsiding in the late 1990s.

===School bullying===
School bullying is a type of bullying that occurs in connection with education, either inside or outside of school. Bullying can be physical, verbal, or emotional and is usually repeated over a period of time.

===Sectarian abuse===
===Self-abuse===

Self-destructive behaviour is a broad set of extreme actions and emotions including self-harm and drug abuse. It can take a variety of forms, and may be undertaken for a variety of reasons. It tends to be most visible in young adults and adolescents, but may affect people of any age.

===Sexual abuse===
Sexual abuse is the forcing of undesired sexual behaviour by one person upon another, when that force falls short of being considered a sexual assault. The offender is referred to as a &quot;sexual abuser&quot; or – more pejoratively – &quot;molester&quot;. The term also covers &quot;any&quot; behaviour by &quot;any&quot; adult towards a child to stimulate either the adult or child sexually. When the victim is younger than the age of consent, it is referred to as child sexual abuse.

===Sexual bullying===
Sexual bullying is &quot;any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person&#x27;s sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person&#x27;s face, behind their back or through the use of technology.&quot;

===Sibling abuse===

Sibling abuse is the physical, emotional, or sexual abuse of one sibling by another.

It is estimated that as many as 3% of children are dangerously abusive towards a sibling, making sibling abuse more common than either child abuse by parents or spousal abuse.

===Smear campaign===

A &quot;smear campaign&quot;, &quot;smear tactic&quot; or simply &quot;smear&quot; is a metaphor for activity that can harm an individual or group&#x27;s reputation by conflation with a stigmatised group. Sometimes smear is used more generally to include any reputation-damaging activity, including such colloquialisms as mud slinging.

=== Spiritual abuse===

Spiritual abuse occurs when a person in religious authority or a person with a unique spiritual practice misleads and maltreats another person in the name of God(s), religion, or in the mystery of any spiritual concept. Spiritual abuse often refers to an abuser using spiritual or religious rank in taking advantage of the victim&#x27;s spirituality (mentality and passion on spiritual matters) by putting the victim in a state of unquestioning obedience to an abusive authority.

===Stalking===
Stalking is unwanted attention towards others by individuals (and sometimes groups of people). Stalking behaviours are related to harassment and intimidation. The word &quot;stalking&quot; is a term that has different meanings in different contexts in psychology and psychiatry; and some legal jurisdictions use it to refer to a certain type of criminal offence. It may also to refer to criminal offences or civil wrongs that include conduct which some people consider to be stalking, such as those described in law as &quot;harassment&quot; or similar terms.

=== Structural abuse===

Structural abuse is sexual, emotional or physical abuse that is imposed on an individual or group by a social or cultural system or authority. Structural abuse is indirect, and exploits the victim on an emotional, mental or psychological level.

=== Substance use disorder===

A substance use disorder is a patterned use of a drug in which the person consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others, and is a form of substance-related disorder. Widely differing definitions of substance use disorder are used in public health, medical and criminal justice contexts. In some cases criminal or anti-social behavior occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well. In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction.

===Surveillance abuse===

Surveillance abuse is the use of surveillance methods or technology to monitor the activity of an individual or group of individuals in a way which violates the social norms or laws of a society. Mass surveillance by the state may constitute surveillance abuse if not appropriately regulated. Surveillance abuse often falls outside the scope of lawful interception. It is illegal because it violates peoples&#x27; right to privacy.

===Taunting===

A taunt is a battle cry, a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or insult intended to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can exist as a form of social competition to gain control of the target&#x27;s cultural capital (i.e. status). In sociological theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one&#x27;s own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly bullying, or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one&#x27;s own status. It can be compared to fighting words and trash-talk.

===Teacher abuse===
===Teasing===

Teasing is a word with many meanings. In human interactions, teasing comes in two major forms, &quot;playful&quot; and &quot;hurtful&quot;. In mild cases, and especially when it is reciprocal, teasing can be viewed as playful and friendly.
However, teasing is often unwelcome and then it takes the form of harassment. In extreme cases, teasing may escalate to actual violence, and may even result in abuse. Children are commonly teased on such matters as their appearance, weight, behaviour, abilities, and clothing. This kind of teasing is often hurtful, even when the teaser believes he or she is being playful. One may also tease an animal. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, may recognise this as play; but in humans, teasing can become hurtful and take the form of bullying and abuse.

===Telephone abuse===
===Terrorism===
Terrorism is the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion.
At present, there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror), are perpetrated for an ideological goal (as opposed to a lone attack), and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). It is sometimes sponsored by state policies when a country is not able to prove itself militarily to another enemy country.

===Transgender abuse or trans bashing===

Trans bashing is the act of victimising a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are transgender or transsexual. Unlike gay bashing, it is committed because of the target&#x27;s actual or perceived gender identity, not sexual orientation.

===Umpire abuse===

Umpire abuse refers to the act of abuse towards an umpire, referee, or other official in sport. The abuse can be verbal abuse (such as namecalling), or physical abuse (such as punching).

===Verbal abuse or verbal attacks===

Verbal abuse is a form of abusive behaviour involving the use of language. It is a form of profanity that can occur with or without the use of expletives. While oral communication is the most common form of verbal abuse, it also includes abusive words in written form.

Verbal abuse is a pattern of behaviour that can seriously interfere with one&#x27;s positive emotional development and can lead to significant detriment to one&#x27;s self-esteem, emotional well-being, and physical state. It has been further described as an ongoing emotional environment organised by the abuser for the purposes of control.

===Whispering campaign===

A whispering campaign is a method of persuasion in which damaging rumours or innuendo are spread about the target, while the source of the rumours seeks to avoid being detected while spreading them (for example, a political campaign might distribute anonymous flyers attacking the other candidate).

=== Workplace abuse or workplace bullying===
Workplace bullying, like childhood bullying, is the tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of aggression is particularly difficult because unlike the typical forms of school bullying, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organisation and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by a manager and takes a wide variety of forms.

==Characteristics and styles of abuse==

Some important characteristics and styles of abuse are:
* overt abuse
* covert (or controlling) abuse
* unpredictability
* disproportional (exaggerated) reactions
* dehumanisation and objectification
* abuse of information
* impossible situations (setting up to fail)
* control by proxy
* ambient abuse (gaslighting)

== Abusive power and control ==
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) is the way that abusers gain and maintain power and control over a victim for an abusive purpose such as psychological, physical, sexual, or financial abuse. The abuse can be for various reasons such as personal gain, personal gratification, psychological projection, devaluation, envy, or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through economic abuse thus limiting the victim&#x27;s actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse. The goal of the abuser is to control and intimidate the victim or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship.

Manipulators and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics, including positive reinforcement (such as praise, superficial charm, flattery, ingratiation, love bombing, smiling, gifts, attention), negative reinforcement, intermittent or partial reinforcement, psychological punishment (such as nagging, silent treatment, swearing, threats, intimidation, emotional blackmail, guilt trips, inattention) and traumatic tactics (such as verbal abuse or explosive anger).

The vulnerabilities of the victim are exploited with those who are particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets. Traumatic bonding can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a climate of fear. An attempt may be made to normalise, legitimise, rationalise, deny, or minimise the abusive behaviour, or blame the victim for it.

Isolation, gaslighting, mind games, lying, disinformation, propaganda, destabilisation, brainwashing and divide and rule are other strategies that are often used. The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs or deprived of sleep to help disorientate them.

Certain personality types feel particularly compelled to control other people.

==Psychological characteristics of abusers==

In their review of data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (a longitudinal birth cohort study; n = 941) Moffitt et al. report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, gender is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression. The study found that whether male or female, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression. Moffitt et al. also argue that antisocial men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while they argue that antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners.

Male and female perpetrators of emotional and physical abuse exhibit high rates of personality disorders. Rates of personality disorder in the general population are roughly 15%–20%, while roughly 80% of abusive men in court-ordered treatment programmes have personality disorders. Female perpetrators have been found to possess personality disorders revolving around narcissistic and compulsive behaviors. Some reports on child maltreatment state that mothers use physical discipline on children more often than fathers, while severe injury and sexual abuse are more often perpetrated by men.

Abusers may aim to avoid household chores or exercise total control of family finances. Abusers can be very manipulative, often recruiting friends, law officers and court officials, even the victim&#x27;s family to their side, while shifting blame to the victim.

==Effects of abuse on victims==


English et al. report that children whose families are characterised by interpersonal violence, including psychological aggression and verbal aggression, may exhibit a range of serious disorders, including chronic depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociation and anger. Additionally, English et al. report that the impact of emotional abuse &quot;did not differ significantly&quot; from that of physical abuse. Johnson et al. report that, in a survey of female patients (n = 825), 24% suffered emotional abuse, and this group experienced higher rates of gynaecological problems. In their study of men emotionally abused by a wife/partner (n = 116), Hines and Malley-Morrison report that victims exhibit high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism.

Namie&#x27;s study of workplace bullying found that 31% of women and 21% of men who reported workplace bullying exhibited three key symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (hypervigilance, intrusive imagery, and avoidance behaviours). A 1998 study of male college students (n = 70) by Simonelli &amp; Ingram found that men who were emotionally abused by their female partners exhibited higher rates of chronic depression than the general population.

A study of college students (n = 80) by Goldsmith and Freyd report that many who have experienced emotional abuse do not characterise the mistreatment as abusive. Additionally, Goldsmith and Freyd show that these people also tend to exhibit higher than average rates of alexithymia (difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions).

Jacobson et al. found that women report markedly higher rates of fear during marital conflicts. However, a rejoinder argued that Jacobson&#x27;s results were invalid due to men and women&#x27;s drastically differing interpretations of questionnaires. Coker et al. found that the effects of mental abuse were similar whether the victim was male or female. Pimlott-Kubiak and Cortina found that severity and duration of abuse were the only accurate predictors of aftereffects of abuse; sex of perpetrator or victim were not reliable predictors.

Analysis of a large survey (n = 25,876) by LaRoche found that women abused by men were slightly more likely to seek psychological help than were men abused by women (63% vs. 62%).

In a 2007 study, Laurent, et al., report that psychological aggression in young couples (n = 47) is associated with decreased satisfaction for both partners: &quot;psychological aggression may serve as an impediment to couples development because it reflects less mature coercive tactics and an inability to balance self/other needs effectively.&quot; A 2008 study by Walsh and Shulman reports that psychological aggression by females is more likely to be associated with relationship dissatisfaction for both partners, while withdrawal by men is more likely to be associated with relationship dissatisfaction for both partners.

<text>In music, the submediant is the sixth degree () of a diatonic scale. The submediant (&quot;lower mediant&quot;) is named thus because it is halfway between the tonic and the subdominant (&quot;lower dominant&quot;) or because its position below the tonic is symmetrical to that of the mediant above. (See the figure in the Degree (music) article.) 

In the movable do solfège system, the submediant is sung as &quot;la&quot; in a major mode, &quot;le&quot; or &quot;lo&quot; in do-based minor and &quot;fa&quot; in la-based minor. It is occasionally called superdominant, as the degree above the dominant. This is its normal name (&quot;sus-dominante&quot;) in French.

In Roman numeral analysis, the triad formed on the submediant is typically symbolized by &quot;VI&quot; if it is a major triad (the default in a minor mode) and by &quot;vi&quot; if it is a minor triad (the default in a major mode).

The term &quot;submediant&quot; may also refer to a relationship of musical keys. For example, relative to the key of C major, the key of A minor is the submediant. In a major key, the submediant key is the relative minor. Modulation (change of key) to the submediant is relatively rare, compared with modulation to the dominant in a major key or modulation to the mediant (relative major) in a minor key.

==Chord==
Amongst the primary roles played by the submediant chord is that in the deceptive cadence, V(7)–vi in major or V(7)–VI in minor. In a submediant chord, the third may be doubled.

In major, the submediant chord also often appears as the starting point of a series of perfect descending fifths and ascending fourths leading to the dominant, vi–ii–V. This is because the relationship between vi and ii and between ii and V is the same as that between V and I. If all chords were major (I–VI–II–V–I), the succession would be one of secondary dominants. This submediant role is as common in popular and classical music as it is in jazz, or any other musical language related to Western European tonality. A more complete version starts the series of fifths on the chord of iii, iii–vi–ii–V–I, as in measures 11 and 12 of Charlie Parker&#x27;s &quot;Blues for Alice&quot;. In minor, the progression from VI to ii° (e.g. A to D diminished in C minor) involves a diminished fifth, as does the ii° chord itself; it may nevertheless be used in VI–ii°–V–I by analogy with the major. Similarly, a scale&#x27;s full counterclockwise circle of 5ths progression I–IV–vii°–iii–vi–ii–V–I can be used by analogy with the usual descending fifth progression, even though IV–vii° involves a diminished fifth.
Another frequent progression is the sequence of descending thirds (I–vi–IV–ii–|–V in root position or first inversion), alternating major and minor chords. This progression is also frequent in jazz, where it is used in a shortened version ||: I vi | ii V7 :|| in what is nicknamed the &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; progression by George Gershwin. This chord progression moves from tonic I, to the submediant (vi), to the supertonic ii, to the dominant V7.

Chromatic submediants, like chromatic mediants, are chords whose roots are related by a major third or minor third, contain one common tone, and share the same quality, i.e. major or minor. They may be altered chords.

Submediant chords may also appear as seventh chords: in major, as vi7, or in minor as VIM7 or vi7:&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;In rock and popular music, VI in minor often uses the chromatically lowered fifth scale degree as its seventh, VI7, for example as in Bob Marley&#x27;s clearly minor mode &quot;I Shot The Sheriff&quot;.

==Name==
The term &quot;mediant&quot; appeared in English in 1753 to refer to the note &quot;midway between the tonic and the dominant&quot;. The term &quot;submediant&quot; must have appeared soon after to similarly denote the note midway between the tonic and the subdominant. The German word &quot;Untermediante&quot; is found in 1771. In France, on the other hand, the sixth degree of the scale was more often called the &quot;sus-dominante&quot;, as the degree above the dominant. This reflects a different conception of the diatonic scale and its degrees:
* In English as in German, the tonic is flanked on both sides by subtonic / supertonic, submediant / mediant and dominant / subdominant – the 7th degree being more usually known as the leading tone (or leading note) if it is a semitone under the tonic. (See the figure in Degree (music)#Major and minor scales);
* In French and Italian, a conception with two centres, subtonic (&quot;sous-tonique&quot;, &quot;sotto-tonica&quot;) and supertonic (&quot;sustonique&quot;, &quot;sopra-tonica&quot;) on both sides of the tonic, subdominant (&quot;sous-dominante&quot;, &quot;sotto-dominante&quot;) and &quot;superdominant&quot; (&quot;sus-dominante&quot;, &quot;sopra-dominante&quot;) on both sides of the dominant – and the mediant left alone between the two.

In the German theory derived from Hugo Riemann, the minor submediant in a major key is considered the &quot;Tonikaparallele&quot; (minor relative of the major tonic), labeled Tp, and the major submediant in a minor key is the &quot;Subdominantparallele&quot; (major relative of the minor subdominant), labeled sP.

<text>In music, the supertonic is the second degree () of a diatonic scale, one whole step above the tonic. In the movable do solfège system, the supertonic note is sung as &quot;re&quot;.

The triad built on the supertonic note is called the supertonic chord. In Roman numeral analysis, the supertonic chord is typically symbolized by the Roman numeral &quot;ii&quot; in a major key, indicating that the chord is a minor chord (in C: D–F–A). In a minor key, it is indicated by &quot;ii&quot; if it is built on the a natural minor scale, indicating that the chord is a diminished chord (in C: D–F–A). Because it is a diminished chord, it usually appears in first inversion (iio6) so that no note dissonates with the bass note.

These chords may also appear as seventh chords: in major, as ii7 (in C: D–F–A–C), while in minor as ii7 (in C: D–F–A–C) or rarely ii7. They are the second-most-common form of nondominant seventh chords.

&lt;/score&gt;

The supertonic chord normally functions as a predominant chord, a chord that naturally resolves to chord with dominant function. The supertonic chord lies a fifth above the V chord. Descending fifths are a strong basis for harmonic motion (see circle of fifths). The supertonic is one of the strongest predominants and approaches the V chord from above by descending fifth.


In major or minor, the major chord built on the lowered supertonic () is called a Neapolitan chord (in C: D–F–A), notated as N6 or II6, usually used in first inversion. The supertonic may be raised as part of the common-tone diminished seventh chord, ii7 (in C: D–F–A–C). One variant of the supertonic seventh chord is the supertonic diminished seventh with the raised supertonic, which equals the lowered third through enharmonic equivalence (in C: D=E).

The term &quot;supertonic&quot; may also refer to a relationship of musical keys. For example, relative to the key of C major, the key of D major (or D minor) is the supertonic.

In Riemannian theory, the supertonic is considered the subdominant parallel: Sp/T in major though sP/T in minor (AM).

<text>In music, the subtonic is the degree of a musical scale which is a whole step below the tonic note. In a major key, it is a lowered, or flattened, seventh scale degree (). It appears as the seventh scale degree in the natural minor and descending melodic minor scales but not in the major scale. In major keys, the subtonic sometimes appears in borrowed chords. In the movable do solfège system, the subtonic note is sung as &quot;te&quot; (or &quot;ta&quot;).

The subtonic can be contrasted with the leading note, which is a &quot;half step&quot; below the tonic. The distinction between leading note and subtonic has been made by theorists since at least the second quarter of the 20th century. Before that, the term &quot;subtonic&quot; often referred to the leading tone triad, for example.

The word &quot;subtonic&quot; is also used as an English translation of &quot;subtonium&quot;, the Latin term used in Gregorian chant theory for the similar usage of a tone one whole step below the mode final in the Dorian, Phrygian, and Mixolydian modes.

== Chord ==
The triad built on the subtonic note is called the subtonic chord. In Roman numeral analysis, the subtonic chord is symbolized by the Roman numeral &quot;VII&quot; in a major key. In a minor key, it is often written as &quot;VII&quot;, the flat symbol being often omitted by some theorists because the subtonic note appears in the natural minor scale. The flat symbol is used for the major scale because the subtonic is a non-diatonic note.

Theorists Stefan Kostka and Dorothy Payne describe the subtonic chord (VII) as &quot;sounding like the V in the key of the relative major—that is, a V of III.&quot; Allen Forte writes that &quot;[w]hile VII in relation to C minor (I) becomes V in relation to III (E major)... As a major triad on an unaltered or natural scale degree 7 in minor the VII functions as a secondary dominant triad in relation to the mediant.&quot; In the minor mode, the subtonic chord may also appear as a major minor seventh chord (i.e. dominant seventh chord), VII7.
In jazz, the flattened seventh is also used as a substitute for the dominant, V, especially in the backdoor cadence, ii–VII7–I, where the subtonic is substituted for the dominant seventh. In this case, VII functions as a pivot chord borrowed from the parallel minor (its dominant seventh). The chords V7 and VII7 have two common tones: in C major, these chords are G–B–D–F and B–D–F–A.

However, while &quot;the leading-tone/tonic relationship is axiomatic to the definition of common practice tonality&quot;, especially cadences and modulations, in popular music and rock a diatonic scalic leading tone (i.e., –) is often absent. In popular music, rather than &quot;departures&quot; or &quot;aberrant&quot;, the &quot;use of the &#x27;flattened&#x27; diatonic seventh scale degree… should not even be viewed as &quot;departures&quot;&quot;. In reference to chords built on the flattened seventh, Richard Franko Goldman argues that &quot;the concept of borrowing is in actuality unnecessary. The mixture of major and minor is a simple fact in the Classical and Romantic periods.&quot;

<doc id="424756" wikidata="Q606620" url="?curid=424756" title="South Tyrolean People's Party">
<text>The South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party (, SVP) is a regionalist and mostly Christian-democratic political party in South Tyrol, an autonomous province with a German-speaking majority in northern Italy. Dieter Steger has been party leader since 2024, while party member Arno Kompatscher has been governor of South Tyrol since 2014.

Founded on 8 May 1945, the SVP has roots in the Deutscher Verband, a confederation of German-speaking parties formed in 1919 after the annexation of South Tyrol by Italy, which shared many of the same leading figures as the early SVP. An ethnic catch-all party, the SVP is aimed at representing South Tyrol&#x27;s German-speaking population, as well as Ladin speakers. It is mainly Christian-democratic, but nevertheless quite diverse, including conservatives, liberals and social democrats. The party also gives special attention to the interests of farmers, which make up a good deal of its electorate, especially in Alpine valleys.

From 1948 to 2013, the party retained an absolute majority in the Landtag of South Tyrol (Provincial Council). Its best result was 67.8% in the 1948 provincial election, its worst 34.5% in the 2023 provincial election. The SVP had a long-lasting alliance with Christian Democracy (plus the Italian Democratic Socialist Party or the Italian Socialist Party) and, since 1994, with some of its successor parties, including the Italian People&#x27;s Party and the Democratic Union of Alto Adige, as well as the Democratic Party of the Left and, later, the Democrats of the Left and the Democratic Party. That coalition 25 years, until the party chose to team up with Lega Alto Adige Südtirol, local section of Lega Nord / Lega, in 2019. The coalition was enlarged to the Brothers of Italy, Die Freiheitlichen and The Civic List after the 2023 provincial election.

The SVP has a sister party in Trentino, the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (PATT). In the Italian Parliament the SVP teams up with other regionalist parties, notably including the Valdostan Union from Aosta Valley, while at the European level it is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and has recently formed electoral pacts with Forza Italia, Italy&#x27;s main EPP member.

==Recent history==
In 1989, Silvius Magnago, long-time SVP leader and governor of South Tyrol since 1960, handed his office to Luis Durnwalder, who would keep the post until 2013. Under Durnwalder&#x27;s long reign, the SVP continued to be the largest party in the Province, garnering more than 50% of the vote in most elections, despite growing competition, chiefly from right-wing parties, i.e. the Union for South Tyrol and Die Freiheitlichen. Most importantly, Durnwalder managed to keep the party, often riven in internal disputes between opposing factions, united.

The SVP joined the European People&#x27;s Party as an observer member in 1993 and became a full member later.

In the 1996 and 2001 general election, the SVP was affiliated to The Olive Tree, on the Populars for Prodi list (led by the Italian People&#x27;s Party) and on its own list, respectively.

===2003–2006 elections===
In the 2003 provincial election, the SVP won 55.6% of the vote and 21 provincial councillors out of 35. Durnwalder, governor since 1989, was returned for the fourth time in office, in coalition composed by the Democrats of the Left (DS) and the Democratic Union of Alto Adige.

In the 2004 European Parliament election, the SVP formed an electoral alliance with The Olive Tree joint list, including the DS. The party&#x27;s share of votes fell below 50% for the first time, to 46.7% (–9.3pp from 1999, mainly because of the big win of the Greens (13.2%, +6.5%). However, Michl Ebner was elected MEP with more than 90,000 preferences and a Green, Sepp Kusstatscher (a former member of the internal left of the SVP), was elected too, the first time that the province had two MEPs.

Also in 2004, the centrist Siegfried Brugger, party chairman since 1992, stepped down and was replaced by Elmar Pichler Rolle, another centrist.

In the 2006 general election, the party was part of the victorious The Union centre-left coalition, and garnered four deputies, including one for its sister-party in Trentino, the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (PATT) – long-serving Siegfried Brugger, Karl Zeller, Johann Georg Widmann and PATT&#x27;s Giacomo Bezzi –, and three senators – Helga Thaler Ausserhofer (representing the party&#x27;s conservative wing), Oskar Peterlini (from the party&#x27;s social-democratic faction) and Manfred Pinzger.

===2008–2009 elections===
In the 2008 general election, the party obtained 44.3% (–9.1pp from 2006 and –16.2pp from 2001), returning only two deputies, Siegfried Brugger and Karl Zeller. In the Senate election, thanks to the plurality voting system, the SVP got its three senators – Helga Thaler Ausserhofer, Oskar Peterlini and Manfred Pinzger – re-elected. The low number of elects in the Chamber was due both to the strong showing of Die Freiheitlichen (9.4%) on the right and the decision not to enter in alliance for the Chamber of Deputies either with the centre-left led by the Democratic Party (PD, 18.0%) – successor of the DS – or the centre-right led by The People of Freedom (PdL,16.0%).

In the 2008 provincial election, the SVP won 48.1% of the vote in the province (–7.5%), while its right-wing rivals (The Freedomites, South Tyrolean Freedom and Union for South Tyrol) gained a combined 21.5% of the vote. During the electoral campaign the party did not endorse its traditional counterparts in Trentino (the Daisy Civic List/Union for Trentino, UpT, and the PATT), in order not to hurt the relations with Lega Nord (LN), whose Trentino section, Lega Trentino, provided the opposition candidate, Sergio Divina, who was however defeated Despite rumors on an alliance with Lega Alto Adige Südtirol, after the election the SVP continued its alliance with the PD, which was the largest party in Trentino.

In April 2009, Richard Theiner, a member of the &quot;Arbeitnehmer&quot; (&quot;employees&quot;) left-leaning wing, was elected party chairman, due to an agreement between the opposing factions. Since then he was assisted by three deputy chairpersons: Thomas Widmann (&quot;Wirtschaft&quot; or &quot;business&quot; faction), Martha Stocker and Paola Bioc Gasser (representative of the Ladin section). The latter was replaced by Daniel Alfreider in 2012. Widmann would later leave the party in 2023.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, due to the absence of its rival parties on the right, the SVP won 52.1% of the vote, electing Herbert Dorfmann.

===2013–2014 elections===
The SVP contested the 2013 general election as part of the centre-left coalition, Italy. Common Good. Some long-serving MPs, notably Siegfried Brugger and Helga Thaler Ausserhofer, chose not to run for re-election and the party selected its candidates through a primary election.

In the general election, the SVP won 44.2% of the provincial vote (–0.1pp from 2008) and, being part of the coalition winning the national majority premium, obtained five deputies: Albrecht Plangger, Renate Gebhard, Daniel Alfreider, PATT&#x27;s Mauro Ottobre and Manfred Schullian. For the Senate, the SVP ran alone in the constituencies of Merano and Brixen, winning both: in Merano outgoing deputy Karl Zeller took 53.5%, while in Brixen Hans Berger 55.4%. The SVP, in alliance with the PD, the UpT and the PATT, contributed also to the election of centre-left or autonomist candidates in the constituency of Bolzano and in those of Trentino.

On 21 April, in a party primary, the SVP selected Arno Kompatscher as its head of the list for the 2013 provincial election, in place of Durnwalder. Kompatscher, 42-year-old mayor of Völs am Schlern, won 82.4% of the vote, while former SVP leader Elmar Pichler Rolle a mere 17.6%.

In the October election, the SVP won 45.7% of the vote in the province (–2.4pp) and lost its 65-year-long absolute majority. Both the German right-wing parties (whose combined share of the vote was 27.2%, +5.7%) and the Greens (8.7%, +2.9%) gained votes. Kompatscher obtained more than 80,000 preference votes and was appointed governor, in coalition with the PD.

In May 2014, Theiner was replaced by Philipp Achammer as party&#x27;s chairman. Daniel Alfreider, Zeno Christanell and Angelika Wiedmer were appointed vice chairpersons. Kompatscher and 28-year-old Achammer formed an entirely new leadership team and represented the party&#x27;s renewal.

In the 2014 European Parliament election, the SVP won 48.0% of the vote in the province and Dorfmann was re-elected to the European Parliament.

===2018–2019 elections===
The SVP, which again chose its candidates through a primary election, contested the 2018 general election in a joint list with the PATT, within the centre-left coalition. The German right-wing parties did not participate, leading the SVP to obtain 48.8% of the vote in the province (+4.6pp). However, due to the new electoral system, it secured four deputies, including one for the PATT, and three senators. For the Chamber, Plangger was elected in Meran (61.2%), Gebhard in Brixen (65.0%), Schullian and PATT&#x27;s Emanuela Rossini from the PR list. For the Senate, Julia Unterberger was elected in Merano (61.1%), Meinhard Durnwalder in Brixen (66.5%) and Dieter Steger from the PR list. The SVP&#x27;s support granted the election of PD&#x27;s candidates for the Chamber and the Senate in Bolzano, but for the first time the centre-left lost badly in Trentino, where the LN – re-styled as &quot;Lega&quot; – became the largest party.

In the 2018 provincial election, incumbent governor Kompatscher was the party&#x27;s leading candidate. In the election on 21 October 2018, the party gained 41.9% (–3.8pp). The PD, SVP&#x27;s traditional ally, did so poorly that the SVP needed to find a new coalition partner: after long negotiations, the party chose to team up with Lega Alto Adige Südtirol in 2019. Additionally, for the 2019 European Parliament election, the party formed an electoral pact with the other two main members of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) from Italy, Forza Italia (FI) and the Union of the Centre (UdC). In the event, the SVP garnered 46.5% of the vote in the province and Dorfmann was re-elected to the European Parliament.

===2022–2024 elections===
In the 2022 general election, the SVP decided to run independently with PATT and the Trentino Project. In response, the centre-left coalition made deals with the Team K and Greens after this decision. The SVP obtained 44.1% (–4.7pp) of the vote at the provincial level. Fewer seats were at stake after the successful 2020 constitutional referendum. For the Chamber, Schullian was re-elected in Bolzano with 32.9%, Gebhard was re-elected in Brixen with 57.4% and incumbent senator Steger was elected from the PR list. For the Senate, the party&#x27;s candidate narrowly lost in Bolzano, Unterberger was re-elected in Meran with 47.8% and Durnwalder was re-elected in Brixen with 46.1%.

In the 2023 provincial election, the party was reduced to 34.5% of the vote (–7.4pp), with Kompatscher as the most voted candidate. That was due to the competition from a number of right-wing and populist German-speaking parties (combined 25.0% of the vote), as well as the split of For South Tyrol with Widmann (3.4%). After the election, the SVP chose to pursue an alliance with the Brothers of Italy (FdI, 6.0%), Die Freiheitlichen (dF, 4.9%), Lega Alto Adige Südtirol (LAAST, 3.1%) and The Civic List (LC, 2.6%). Kompatscher, who favoured a centre-left coalition, stayed as governor. The new government was formed by eight ministers from the SVP and one each for FdI, dF and LAAST, while LC provided external support.

In May 2024, Steger was elected party leader, replacing Achammer.

In the run-up of the 2024 European Parliament election, the SVP confirmed its electoral pact with FI. In the event, the SVP garnered 47.0% of the vote in the province and Dorfmann was re-elected to the European Parliament.

==Ideology and factions==

The SVP is an example of a catch-all party. Its ideology ranges from Christian democracy to social democracy, due to the virtual absence of a true social-democratic rival party in the region. In German-speaking valleys the SVP has had almost no opposition for decades.

The SVP is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), and its MEP sits in the EPP Group of the European Parliament.

In the years the SVP suffered many splits reflecting the diverse composition of the party (Tyrolean Homeland Party, Social Progressive Party of South Tyrol and Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol) and many SVP leading members left the party in order to join other parties, notably including Alfons Benedikter, a right-winger who launched the Union for South Tyrol in 1989, Christian Waldner, a conservative liberal who launched Die Freiheitlichen in 1992, Sepp Kusstatscher, a leftist who joined the Greens in 1999, and finally Roland Atz, who switched to Lega Alto Adige Südtirol in 2008. The Party of Independents/Freedom Party of South Tyrol, the South Tyrolean Homeland Federation, the Union for South Tyrol and Die Freiheitlichen can thus all be considered splits of the SVP.

Within the party it is possible to identify three official internal factions:
*&quot;Landwirtschaft&quot; (Agriculture), representing the interests of farmers and, usually, traditional and Catholic values; the faction, which has had in Luis Durnwalder, governor from 1989 to 2013, and Arno Kompatscher, governor since 2013, its main representatives in government, has featured in recent times Hans Berger, Herbert Dorfmann, Meinhard Durnwalder, Josef Noggler, Stefan Premstaller, Siegfried Rinner, Arnold Schuler and Manfred Schullian; as of 2023, the faction is the party&#x27;s strongest and includes at least 5 provincial councillors out of 13, the party&#x27;s MEP, 1 deputy out of 3 and 1 senator out of 2.
*&quot;Wirtschaft&quot; (Economy), representing small business; the faction has been led by Gerhard Brandstätter and has featured Daniel Alfreider, Manfred Pinzger, Dieter Steger, Helga Thaler Ausserhofer (a conservative) Thomas Widmann, Karl Zeller, as well as &quot;Landwirtschaft&quot; member Kompatscher (who wields strong support from the faction); as of 2023, the faction includes the party&#x27;s MEP, at least 3 provincial councillors out of 13, 1 deputy out of 3 and 1 senator out of 2.
*&quot;Arbeitnehmer&quot; (Labour), the social-democratic faction and political arm of the Union of South Tyrolean Independent Trade Unions (ASGB); the faction, currently led by Madgalena Amhof and previously led by Reinhold Perkmann, Rosmarie Pamer, and Cristoph Gufler, has featured Renate Gebhard, Oskar Peterlini, Richard Theiner, Martin Pircher and Harald Stauder (party secretary since 2024); as of 2023, the faction includes at least 4 provincial councillors out of 13 and 1 deputy out of 3.

In August 2018 a new faction, &quot;Plattform Heimat&quot; (Homeland Platform), was launched. The grouping represents the party&#x27;s right-wing, which has been weakened over the years by the competition of several right-wing parties and is led by Michael Epp. Since 2023 the faction is represented by 2 provincial concillors out of 13.

Siegfried Brugger and Elmar Pichler Rolle, who led the party in 1992–2004 and 2004–2009 respectively, are centrist figures who worked for preserving internal unity. In order to prevent the party&#x27;s break-up along right-left lines, in 2008 Perkmann, leader of the &quot;Arbeitnehmer&quot;, proposed a &quot;federal reform&quot; of the party in order to preserve its catch-all nature and simultaneously give more autonomy to its factions, which had been given an official status. The result was a mild reform of the party and the election to the party leadership in 2009 of a ticket composed by a leading member of the &quot;Arbeitnehmer&quot;, Richard Theiner, and a leading member of the &quot;Wirtschaft&quot; faction, Thomas Widmann, plus Martha Stocker, a close ally of Durnwalder. The internal divide was also displayed during the vote of confidence on Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s fourth government in 2008: Pinzger and Thaler Ausserhofer abstained, while Brugger, Zeller and Peterlini voted against.

Former chairman Philip Achammer is a member of the boards of all the three official factions.

The Young Generation (&quot;Junge Generation&quot;, JG) is the youth movement of the party, including all members at the age of 14 to 30.

<doc id="424757" wikidata="Q8072139" url="?curid=424757" title="Zimmermann–Sassaman key-signing protocol">
<text>In cryptography, the Zimmermann–Sassaman key-signing protocol is a protocol to speed up the public key fingerprint verification part of a key signing party. It requires some work before the event.

The protocol was invented during a key signing party with Len Sassaman, Werner Koch, Phil Zimmermann, and others.

==Sassaman-Efficient==

===Before the party===
The Sassaman-Efficient method is the first of the 2 types developed. Before the event, all participants email the keysigning coordinator their public keys. The coordinator then makes a text file of all the keys and accompanied fingerprint and then hashes it. They then proceed to make the text file and checksum available to all participants. The participants then download the file and check the validity using the hash. Then the participants print out the list and make sure that their own key is correct.

===During the party===
Everyone brings their own key list so that they know it is correct and not manipulated. Then the coordinator reads aloud or projects the checksums of the keys. Each participant verifies and states that their key is correct and once that is established a check mark can be put by that key. Once all the keys have been checked then the line folds upon itself and the participants then show each other at least 2 government-issued IDs. Once sufficient verification is established with the authenticity of the person, the other participant puts a second check mark by their name.

===After the party===
The participants then fetch the keys from a server or obtain a keyring made for the event. They sign each key on their list with 2 check marks and make sure that the fingerprints match. The signatures are then uploaded to the server or mailed directly to the key owner (if requested).

==Sassaman-Projected==
The Sassaman-Projected method is a modified version of the Sassaman-Efficient, with the purpose for large groups. They both follow the same way with the exception of verifying identity. Instead of doing it individually the 2 forms of ID are projected for everyone to see at once. Once the person has verified that it is their key, the rest of the participants make 2 check marks next to the key.

<text>To kiss hands is a constitutional term used in the United Kingdom to refer to the formal installation of the prime minister or other Crown-appointed government ministers to their office.

==Overview==
In the past, the term referred to the requirement that the office-holder actually kiss the hands of the monarch as a symbol of personal fealty and loyalty, that fealty and loyalty being a requirement to serve in the King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s government.
In modern times, office-holders are not expected to physically kiss the hands of the monarch before assuming the role, neither at this ceremony nor at any other point in the process of installing a new office-holder. Simply being received by the monarch is taken to validate the selection, with this meeting being described in the Court Circular as &quot;kissing hands&quot;. The invitation issued to a party leader to form a government is sometimes still described as &quot;an invitation to kiss hands&quot;. The metaphorical kissing of hands (i.e. the appointment) does not legally take place until the subsequent meeting of the Privy Council, when the new minister is formally appointed as a member of the Council.

When appointing a Secretary of State (the top rank in the UK government), the protocol also involves the delivery by the King or Queen of the seals of office into the hands of the appointee. This is also valid for other officers who are keepers of seals, such as the Lord Privy Seal or the Lord Chancellor, who is also keeper of the Great Seal of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The ceremony usually takes place in Buckingham Palace, but it has been known to happen in Windsor Castle or Balmoral Castle. More unusually, in April 1908, Edward VII summoned H. H. Asquith out of the country to the Hôtel du Palais, Biarritz, France, where the King was on holiday at the time. 

In his autobiography, Tony Blair recalled being confused by the fact that the ceremony did not involve literally kissing Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s hands, being instead told to &quot;brush them [the hands] gently with your lips&quot;. When he was ushered into the room to meet the Queen, Blair tripped on a piece of carpet and fell onto the Queen&#x27;s hands.

Due to the failing health of Elizabeth II, the 2022 kissing hands ceremony of Liz Truss took place at Balmoral, where the ailing Queen was spending her final days, marking the only time in her 70-year reign that the ceremony did not take place at Buckingham Palace. It was the Queen&#x27;s last official act before her death two days later. This was the first time the ceremony took place at Balmoral since 1885, when Lord Salisbury began his first stint as prime minister.

<text>In public-key cryptography, a key signing party is an event at which people present their public keys to others in person, who, if they are confident the key actually belongs to the person who claims it, digitally sign the certificate containing that public key and the person&#x27;s name, etc. Key signing parties are common within the PGP and GNU Privacy Guard community, as the PGP public key infrastructure does not depend on a central key certifying authority and instead uses a distributed web of trust approach. Key signing parties are a way to strengthen the web of trust. Participants at a key signing party are expected to present adequate identity documents.

Although PGP keys are generally used with personal computers for Internet-related applications, key signing parties themselves generally do not involve computers, since that would give adversaries increased opportunities for subterfuge. Rather, participants write down a string of letters and numbers, called a &quot;public key fingerprint&quot;, which represents their key. The fingerprint is created by a cryptographic hash function, which condenses the public key down to a string which is shorter and more manageable. Participants exchange these fingerprints as they verify each other&#x27;s identification. Then, after the party, they obtain the public keys corresponding to the fingerprints they received and digitally sign them.

<text>The Canarian Coalition (, CC or CCa) is a regionalist and Canarian nationalist political party in Spain operating in the Canary Islands. The party&#x27;s aim is for greater autonomy for the islands but not independence. Its position has been labeled as centrist and centre-right. The party governed the Canary Islands from 1993 to 2019; and currently since 2023 under Fernando Clavijo Batlle&#x27;s leadership.

It usually negotiates with the plurality party at the Cortes to form a majority in exchange for resources for the islands. It also governs the local administrations of Tenerife, La Palma, and Fuerteventura, as well as having majority control in some of the town councils on the Canary Islands.

==History==
The coalition was formed in February 1993 from a grouping of five parties (the largest being the Canarian Independent Groups) under one banner and has governed the Canary Islands since 1993, when it replaced the former Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) administration after a motion of no confidence. After entering government, CC obtained power for the regional government to levy its own taxes and a law compensating the islands for their distance from the mainland. The coalition became a single party in 2005.

<doc id="424775" wikidata="Q885433" url="?curid=424775" title="Galician Nationalist Bloc">
<text>The Galician Nationalist Bloc ( ) is a political party from Galicia, formed with the merger of a series of left-wing Galician nationalist parties. It is self-defined as a &quot;patriotic front&quot;.

Founded in 1982 under the guidance of historical leader Xosé Manuel Beiras, the BNG calls for further devolution of powers to the Parliament of Galicia and the official and unambiguous recognition of Galicia as a nation. The BNG also promotes affirmative action for the Galician language. The current leader—the president of the National Council and national spokesperson—is Ana Pontón.

The BNG has strong ties with the Galician Trade Union Confederation (Confederación Intersindical Galega, CIG), with the student union Erguer-Estudantes da Galiza (Stand Up–Students of Galiza), the agrarian unions Galician Peasant Union (Sindicato Labrego Galego, SLG) and Galician Rural Federation (FRUGA), and with environmentalist, feminist and Galician language organizations.

From 2005 to 2009, BNG was part of a coalition government along with the Socialists&#x27; Party of Galicia, in which its leader, Anxo Quintana, served as the vice-president of the Galician regional government.

==History==

===Origins and formation===
The Galician People&#x27;s Union (UPG) and the Galician Socialist Party (PSG), left-wing Galician nationalist parties, were founded in the early 1960s by anti-Francoist activists. In 1975 the Galician National-Popular Assembly (AN-PG) was founded, as a &quot;mass front&quot; of the UPG to organize protests and preparate a future electoral candidacy. In 1977 the UPG and the AN-PG created the Galician National-Popular Bloc (BN-PG), that run for the first democratic elections since 1936.

In October 1981, the first elections for the Parliament of Galicia were held. These elections were won by the conservative and Spanish People&#x27;s Alliance, while the Galician nationalist parties had a relatively low electoral result. The three MPs of the joint BN-PG and PSG list were expelled from Parliament after they refused to take the oath to the Spanish constitution.

The UPG and the AN-PG agreed in early 1982 to reformulate their project, in the form a left-wing nationalist front that would cover a greater political spectrum, with different currents and parties inside it. The first meeting was held on 15 May, with the participation of AN-PG, UPG, PSG, Galiza Ceibe-OLN, Assembly of Galician Nationalists, Libertarian Collective &quot;Arco da Vella&quot; and independents of Santiago de Compostela and A Coruña. All this organizations and independents had signed an appeal for the unity of Galician nationalism; under the basic principles of recognition of the multinational character of the Spanish State, right of self-determination, anti-imperialism, self-government, self-organization, internal pluralism and democracy. This meeting would lead to the establishment of a Permanent National Managing Commission, with 22 members. In addition to the previous groups, Galician Revolutionary Students (ERGA), Nationalist Advance and independents of Vigo and O Condado would also join the new project.

In spite of the unity, there were great ideological and tactical differences between the different parties. PSG gave great importance to the unity of nationalist trade-unionism and to participating in the institutions. on the other hand, Galiza Ceibe-OLN defended an active boycott of all the elections and a full rupture with the constitutional system. Nationalist Advance defended that the new organization should reject all laws and seek full national independence. At a meeting held on 27 June the political program of the organization was approved, without explicitly mentioning independence, although the creation of a Galician state was considered the main final goal. The new organization also wanted to balance institutional presence and social mobilization, to better defend the &quot;popular and national interests&quot;. In subsequent meetings, local and regional assemblies were established. Those assemblies discussed the document adopted before the celebration of the founding Assembly. On 11 July, the Assembly of Galician Nationalists (ANG) decided to leave the Permanent Managing Commission, on the grounds that the new front was at the service of the individual parties and lacked a serious minimum political program. Despite this, ANG members continued to work individually on the creation of the new front.

===1st National Assembly (1982–1984)===
On 25 and 26 September 1982, the founding assembly took place on the Fronton Municipal of Riazor, A Coruña. This new force was defined as &quot;interclassist&quot;, seeking to defend all the Galician &quot;popular classes&quot;. The Estreleira was chosen as the official flag, and (after a very close voting) &quot;Galician Nationalist Bloc&quot; was chosen as the new name. This assembly also approved the five basic principles of BNG:
1. Galiza [Galicia], as a nation, has the rights of self-determination and of exercising its national sovereignty.
2. Defense of democracy and popular interests.
3. The need for political and social self-organization, and non-dependency in the relations of Galiza.
4. Solidarity, anti-imperialism, peace and international disarmament.
5. A social model that promotes the socioeconomic development without dependence and on behalf of the welfare of the whole people.

Finally, AN-PG (which will cease to exist de facto after this Assembly), UPG, PSG and various independents joined the front. Galiza Ceibe-OLN decide to leave after the Assembly decided that to participate in all elections, while the Libertarian Collective &quot;Arco da Vella&quot; also left due to their disagreement with the name and part of the political line.

In the general elections of 1982, the BNG (still a coalition between the BN-PG and the PSG, since the new front had not yet been registered) gained 38,522 votes and no seats. These election results generated an internal debate within the PSG, which lead to an extraordinary Congress in January 1983, in which the party decided to leave the BNG. Despite this, a large group of members of the PSG split and continued to work inside the BNG with the name Socialist Collective (CS). In 1984 the PSG merged with Galician Left (EG), to create a new party: Galician Socialist Party–Galician Left (PSG-EG). The National Day of Galicia of 1983, the BNG called for a demonstration in Santiago de Compostela, attended by between 7,000 (according to the Spanish Police) and 15,000 (according to the BNG) people, with the main slogans of &quot;Nationalism: the solution for Galicia&quot; and &quot;Unity in the Anti-imperialist Struggle&quot;. The demonstration was dissolved by the police, leaving various protesters injured.

Local elections were held in April of the same year (1983), being the first ones to be run by the BNG. The front obtained 50,491 votes, 117 local councilors and 6 mayors (Corcubión, Fene, Moaña, Malpica de Bergantiños and Carnota).

===2nd National Assembly (1984–1986)===

The II National Assembly took place in December 1984 in Santiago de Compostela. This assembly defined the political position of the BNG in fundamental aspects of its political project, such as environmentalism, feminism, education, Galician language or Galician culture.

Throughout that year, BNG developed an enormous political activity against the deindustrialization caused by the policy of &quot;restructuring&quot;, actively participating in the three general strikes that took place in Galicia that year. The front also developed actions of protest against what was considered the appropriation and manipulation of the remains of historic Galician nationalist Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao, receiving in response a tough police crackdown. Defending the memory of the nationalist politician and intellectual was the main reason for the National Day of Galicia of that year, gaining (for the first time in many years) a permit to enter the historic center of Santiago de Compostela.

In the Galician elections of 1985, the front only gained one seat (occupied by Xosé Manuel Beiras). This time, the MP was allowed to take the seat in exchange for &quot;promising&quot; to comply with the constitution (but not taking the Oath).

===Extraordinary National Assembly (1985–1987)===
The bad electoral results culminated in an internal debate which ended with the convening of an extraordinary National Assembly, held at Santiago on 15 December. BNG ratified its political tactic of accepting the Parliamentary requirement of accepting the constitution. This led to some new internal tensions, particularly inside the UPG. In 1986 this tensions culminates in a split in the UPG, with the more radical sector forming a new political group: Collective 22 March. This collective would create a new organization in July, the Communist Party of National Liberation (PCLN), an independentist and communist party. The PCLN would remain within the BNG, despite not agreeing with its new political line.

The same year (1986) the Spanish NATO membership referendum took place, and the Galician Nationalist Bloc campaigned in favor of leaving. Remaining would have won in Spain and in Galicia. In the Spanish elections of 1986 BNG gained 27,049 votes (2.11 of the Galician vote) and no seats. The same year, the party boycotted the official acts of remembrance of the 1936 statute of autonomy, demanding self-determination and an end to &quot;historical manipulation&quot;. The BNG also campaigned against the entry of Galicia in the European Economic Community.

===3rd National Assembly (1987–1989)===
On 7 and 8 February 1987 the III National Assembly took place at O Carballiño. Party members approved the mechanisms that allowed the &quot;updating&quot; of the tactics and forms of political work of the front, by starting the process of opening the BNG to Galician society. The party also chose a new corporate image.

The party tried to form a unitary Galician nationalist candidacy to the European elections of that year, but the talks failed. BNG then rejected a coalition offer made by Herri Batasuna, and decided to run alone, gaining 53,116 votes. The PCLN was expelled from the BNG for supporting Herri Batasuna in the election campaign, instead of its own list. After their expulsion, PCLN would create (along with Galiza Ceibe-OLN and local groups) the Galician People&#x27;s Front (FPG).

Later, on the same year, local elections were held, with the front obtaining 61,256 votes, 139 local councilors and 7 mayors (Corcubión, Carnota, Noia, Ares, Fene, Ribadeo and Malpica de Bergantiños).

In July 1988, Galiza Nova, a new youth organization, is founded, fully becoming part of the BNG. Galiza Nova replaced Galician Revolutionary Students (ERGA) as its youth-wing. The front celebrated the National Day of Galicia of that year with a demonstration (attended by 10,000 people) with the slogan &quot;Common project&quot;, that wanted to summarize the renewed political line of the 3rd National Assembly. Due to the wave of forest fires that inundated Galicia that year, the BNG boosted, along with several environmentalist associations and groups, the first in Galicia, in order to defend the Galician forests.

===4th National Assembly (1987–1989)===
The 4th National Assembly of the organization took place in February 1989 in Lugo. The discussions focused on setting a political strategy to answer the economic crisis that was affecting Galicia at the time. Xosé Manuel Beiras was elected as the candidate for the presidency of Galicia. In the Galician elections of 1989 BNG gained 105,703 votes and 5 MPs. The Galician Nationalist Party-Galicianist Party (PNG-PG) and FPG failed in their attempt to get representation. Galician Socialist Party-Galician Left (PSG-EG) obtained two seats. In June of the same year, the second European elections in the history of Spain were held, with the BNG running alone again, as the only Galician candidacy, and gaining 46,052 votes. In October, general elections were held, with the BNG gaining 47,763 and failing to win any seat again. In 1989, there was a popular movement of protest in the town of Allariz, against the mayor Leopoldo Pérez Camba (People&#x27;s Party), which evolved into a full revolt and ended with the resignation of the local government. After the resignation, Anxo Quintana, a BNG local councilor, was elected as the mayor of the town. Since then, Allariz has been the main stronghold of the BNG (which has won all local elections since 1993 with more than the 60% of the vote).

In June 1990, the Permanent Commission made public an economic document, with an analysis on the crisis of Galicia and the solutions to it proposed by the front. In July, the BNG held a common march in Santiago de Compostela with the PNG-PG.

===5th National Assembly (1991–1993)===
In January 1991, the V National Assembly was held in Vigo. Galiza Nova was fully integrated into the structures of the front. BNG developed an intense campaign that year with the slogan &quot;Galiza self-determination&quot;, which culminated on 6 December with a rally in Santiago de Compostela attended by more than 10,000 people. Later on that same year, Inzar and PNG-PG joined BNG.

====Local elections of 1991====
In May 1991, local elections were held. BNG ran in 162 municipalities (out of 311), getting 107,932 votes, 8 mayors (Allariz, Malpica de Bergantiños, Noia, Corcubión, Vilar de Santos, Ribadeo, Fene, and Carnota) and 241 town councilors.

In 1992, the front supported and actively participated in the national general strike on 2 April. During that year, the front also campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty and a group of independents within BNG created the collective Nationalist Left (IN), in an attempt to gain internal power and to lower the influence of the Galician People&#x27;s Union.

===6th National Assembly (1993–1995)===
The 6th National Assembly was held in March 1993 at A Coruña, with no relevant changes. BNG run for the Spanish elections of 1993 with the slogan &quot;Galiza with its own strength&quot;, obtaining 126,965 votes and getting very close to gaining seats at A Coruña and Pontevedra. Later in the same year, BNG participated in an international conference in Denmark of parties and individuals that opposed the Maastricht Treaty.

In the Galician elections of October, the front gained 269,233 votes and 13 seats. Galician Unity, the old PSG-EG, would also join BNG after his electoral failures of that year. In the European elections of 1994 the front won a record 139,221 votes, but failed again to gain any seats. This positive electoral trend would continue in the local elections of 1995, in which the Bloc obtained 208,098 votes, 428 local councillors and 12 mayors (Allariz, Vilar de Santos, Fene, Corcubión, As Pontes de García Rodríguez, Cangas do Morrazo, Noia, Vilariño de Conso, Moaña, Bueu, Poio and Rairiz de Veiga)

The increasing unity of Galician nationalism in the political arena also had consequences in other sectors. One of those sectors were unionism, were the old unions National Inter-Union of the Galician Workers (INTG) (aligned with the Galician People&#x27;s Union-BNG) and General Confederation of Galician Workers (CXTG) (aligned with PSG-EG) merged to create Confederación Intersindical Galega (CIG).

===2012 split===
In 2012, several parties and individuals abandoned the front, dissatisfied with its political line and the control exercised by the UPG. Encontro Irmandiño abandoned the bloc and joined with Galician Workers&#x27; Front (Fronte Obreira Galega), the Galician People&#x27;s Front (FPG), Movemento pola Base and other collectives to form Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood. Anova obtained four seats in the 2012 Galician election as part of the Galician Left Alternative coalition. Anova is a pro-independence, anticapitalist, anti-globalization, republican and anti-imperialist organization.
Other groups that split were the more moderate social-democratic and autonomist Máis Galiza, Nationalist Left and the Galician Nationalist Party-Galicianist Party (PNG-PG). They formed Commitment to Galicia (CxG), a social-democratic and autonomist organization. No CxG deputies were elected at the 2012 Galician election.

===Since 2016===
In 2016, as part of a self-proclaimed &quot;refoundation&quot; of the party, Ana Pontón was elected national spokesperson. This marked the first time a woman held such a prominent position within the party. She also serves as the party&#x27;s candidate as the party&#x27;s candidate for President of the Xunta de Galicia in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 regional elections. In each of these elections, the BNG achieved better results than in the previous one, ultimately reaching a historic total of 25 seats, a significant milestone for Galician nationalism. Ana Pontón has been recognized as a leader who blends nationalism with social issues, practicing an inclusive and moderate leadership style.

==Ideology==
The BNG is composed of a majority of grassroots independent members and a number of political parties. Traditionally, the largest party and main ideological influence has been the Galician People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Unión do Povo Galego&quot;, UPG).

In origin, the UPG, and consequently the BNG, were strongly left-wing and supported the idea of Galician independence. However, since 1990 BNG had gradually abandoned talk about independence and self-determination, especially since the moderate nationalist party Galician Unity (&quot;Unidade Galega&quot;) joined the coalition. According to its former leader, Anxo Quintana, BNG at that time was not a pro-independence party, although some individuals and organizations within it continued to express a support for the idea.

Nonetheless, the hegemonic UPG has supported independence again since 2011 while preserving its left-wing core. Following the National Assembly of Amio (2012), the whole front readopted the idea of independence and the creation of a Galician republic. That same year, the BNG adopted a critical position towards the European Union.

The BNG supports the State of Palestine within the context of Israeli–Palestinian conflict. They have been supportive of BDS measures against Israel and have hosted events, featuring the anti-Zionist group, PFLP, that has been designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the European Union, the United States, Canada, and Japan.

== Organization ==

=== Structure ===
The BNG regulates itself through local, regional and national assemblies in which members can vote for and be elected as regional delegates and thereafter members of the National Council. However, the internal functioning of the party has come into criticism in recent years. As a result, several new organizations calling for &quot;transparency and internal democracy&quot; have formed within the BNG, namely the Encontro Irmandinho (led by former BNG president Xosé Manuel Beiras), Movemento Pola Base (formed by grassroots members and backed by the youth section Galiza Nova), and A Alternativa (supported by former Member of the European Parliament Camilo Nogueira). Furthermore, Anxo Quintana&#x27;s leadership has been called into question after the poor results of the Galician 2009 elections.

=== Composition ===
Joint affiliation with other political groups outside the BNG is not allowed. The political groups currently recognised by the BNG (via a lengthy ratification process) are:

Historical parties and currents:
=== Leadership ===
=== Alliances ===
The BNG has taken part in several alliances with other parties in Spain to have its interests represented in the European Parliament. These alliances are usually established with other regionalist and separatist parties such as the Basque Nationalist Party and the Catalan Convergence and Union. Currently, the BNG is part of the Republics Now coalition, which also includes the Basque EH Bildu and the Catalan Esquerra Republicana. 

=== International affiliation and relations ===
In the European Parliament, the BNG is a member of the European Greens–European Free Alliance group. 

== Electoral performance ==
BNG began its electoral history in a modest way. However, it quickly progressed from a single seat in the Galician Parliament to its second best result in 1997 when, under the leadership of Xosé Manuel Beiras, it won almost 25 per cent of the total vote and 18 seats (out of 75) at the Parliament.

After the 2001 Galician elections, the BNG still was the second-largest political group in the Galician Parliament with 17 seats, slightly ahead of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Galicia (PSdG) in total votes. Yet it was not until 2005 that BNG could force a coalition government, despite losing four seats and slipping to the third place. The BNG vice-president Anxo Quintana became then the vice-president of Galicia, and BNG could directly appoint a number of &quot;conselleiros&quot; (ministers) for some government departments. Prior to that, the other major Galician party, the conservative People&#x27;s Party (PPdeG), had remained in control of the overall majority and therefore of the Galician government. In the 2009 elections, a sharp reduction in votes for the PSdG, together with poor results for the BNG (12 seats), forced the left-wing coalition out of government to the benefit of the PPdeG.

Meanwhile, the BNG won 208,688 votes (11.37 per cent of the Galician vote, 0.8 of the Spanish total) in the 2004 Spanish general election, gaining two of the 350 seats in the Spanish Congress of Deputies. Results in the 2008 Spanish general election were slightly improved (+0.7% in Galicia), although resulting in the same number of seats. Results in local elections have traditionally been good, with a constant increase in the number of seats won, allowing BNG to govern or to, at least, take part in the government coalitions of most Galician large urban centres.

<doc id="424777" wikidata="Q3132779" url="?curid=424777" title="Henry Flood">
<text>Henry Flood (1732 – 2 December 1791) was an Irish statesman and Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench for Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, and afterwards at Christ Church, Oxford, where he became proficient in the classics. He was a leading Irish politician, and a friend of Henry Grattan, the leader of the Irish Patriot Party. He became an object of public interest in 1770, when he was put on trial for murder, after killing a political rival in a duel.

Henry was the son to Warden Flood. He was married to Lady Frances Beresford, daughter of Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone, and Lady Catherine Power, who brought him a large fortune.

==Irish Parliament==
In 1759, he entered the Irish parliament as member for County Kilkenny, a seat he held until 1761. There was at that time no party in the Irish House of Commons that could truly be called national, and until a few years before there had been none that deserved even the name of opposition. The Irish parliament was still constitutionally subordinate to the English privy council; it had practically no powers of independent legislation, and none of controlling the policy of the executive, which was nominated by the ministers in London. Though the majority of the people were Roman Catholics, no person of that faith could either enter parliament or exercise the franchise; the penal code, which made it almost impossible for a Roman Catholic to hold property, to follow a learned profession, or even to educate his children, and which in numerous particulars pressed severely on the Roman Catholics and subjected them to degrading conditions, was as yet unrepealed, though in practice largely obsolete; the industry and commerce of Ireland were throttled by restrictions imposed, in accordance with the economic theories of the period, in the interest of the rival trade of Great Britain. Men like Anthony Malone and Hely-Hutchinson fully realised the necessity for far-reaching reforms; and it only needed the ability and eloquence of Flood in the Irish House of Commons to raise up an independent party in parliament, and to create in the country a public opinion with definite intelligible aims.

The chief objects for which Flood strove were the shortening of the duration of parliament which had then no legal limit in Ireland except that of the reigning sovereign&#x27;s life, the reduction of the scandalously heavy pension list, the establishment of a national militia, and, above all, the complete legislative independence of the Irish parliament. For some years little was accomplished; but in 1768 the English ministry, which had special reasons at the moment for avoiding unpopularity in Ireland, allowed an octennial bill (limiting the term of parliament to eight years) to pass, which was the first step towards making the Irish House of Commons in some measure representative of public opinion.

It had become the practice to allow crown patronage in Ireland to be exercised by the owners of parliamentary boroughs in return for their undertaking to manage the House in the government interest. But during the vice-royalty of Lord Townshend the aristocracy, and more particularly these undertakers as they were called, were made to understand that for the future their privileges in this respect would be curtailed. When, therefore, an opportunity was taken by the government in 1768 for reasserting the constitutional subordination of the Irish parliament, these powerful classes were thrown into a temporary alliance with Flood. In the following year, in accordance with the established procedure, a money bill was sent over by the privy council in London for acceptance by the Irish House of Commons. It was rejected, but a reason for this course was assigned; namely, that the bill had not originated in the Irish House. In consequence, parliament was peremptorily prorogued, and a recess of fourteen months was employed by the government in securing a majority by the most extensive corruption. Nevertheless, when parliament met in February 1771 another money bill was thrown out on the motion of Flood; and the next year Lord Townshend, the lord lieutenant whose policy had provoked this conflict, was recalled. The struggle was the occasion of a publication, famous in its day, called &quot;Baratariana&quot;, to which Flood contributed a series of powerful letters after the manner of Junius, one of his collaborators being Henry Grattan.

The success which had thus far attended Flood&#x27;s efforts had placed him in a position such as no Irish politician had previously attained. He had, as an eminent historian of Ireland observes, &quot;proved himself beyond all comparison the greatest popular orator that his country had yet produced, and also a consummate master of parliamentary tactics. Under parliamentary conditions that were exceedingly unfavourable, and in an atmosphere charged with corruption, venality and subservience, he had created a party before which ministers had begun to quail, and had inoculated the Protestant constituencies with a genuine spirit of liberty and self-reliance.&quot; Lord Harcourt, who succeeded Townshend as viceroy, saw that Flood must be conciliated at any price &quot;rather than risk the opposition of so formidable a leader.&quot; Even his trial for the murder of his long-time enemy James Agar in 1770 did nothing to damage his career or his reputation. Found guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter, he was spared a prison sentence, and the episode is said to have made duelling more rather than less respectable.

Flood represented Callan between 1762 and 1776, where he had a bitter feud with the Agar family, whose effective head James Agar he killed in a duel, and Longford Borough between 1768 and 1769. Accordingly, in 1775, he was offered and accepted a seat, in the Privy Council of Ireland and the office of vice-treasurer with a salary of £3500 a year. For this step, he has been severely criticized. Flood may reasonably have held that he had a better prospect of advancing his policy by the leverage of a ministerial position. The result, however, was that the leadership of the national party passed from Flood to Grattan, who entered the Irish parliament in the same session that Flood became a minister.

Flood continued in office for nearly seven years. Re-elected for Enniskillen in 1777, he necessarily remained silent on the subject of the independence of the Irish parliament, and had to be content with advocating minor reforms as occasion offered. He was instrumental in obtaining bounties on the export of Irish corn to foreign, countries and other commercial concessions. On the other hand, he failed to procure the passing of a Habeas corpus bill and a bill for making the judges irremovable, while his support of Lord North&#x27;s American policy gravely injured his popularity and reputation.

An important event in 1778 led indirectly to his recovering to some extent his former position in the country; this was the alliance of France with the revolted American colonies. Ireland was thereby placed in peril of a French invasion, while the English government could provide no troops to defend the island. A volunteer movement was then set on foot to meet the emergency; in a few weeks more than 40,000 men were under arms, officered by the country gentry, and controlled by Lord Charlemont. This volunteer force, in which Flood was a colonel soon made itself felt in politics.

A Volunteer Convention, formed with all the regular organisation of a representative assembly, but wielding the power of an army, began menacingly to demand the removal of the commercial restrictions which were destroying Irish prosperity. Under, this pressure the government gave way; the whole colonial trade was in 1779 thrown open to Ireland for the first time, and other concessions were also extorted. Flood, who had taken an active though not a leading part in this movement, now at last resigned his office to rejoin his old party. He found to his chagrin that his former services had been to a great extent forgotten and that he was eclipsed by Grattan.

When in a debate on the constitutional question in 1779 Flood complained of the small consideration shown him in relation to a subject which he had been the first to agitate, he was reminded that by the civil law if a man should separate from his wife and abandon her for seven years, another might then take her and give her his protection. But though Flood had lost control of the movement for independence of the Irish parliament, the agitation, backed as it now was by the Volunteer Convention and by increasing signs of popular disaffection, led at last in 1782 to the concession of the demand, together with a number of other important reforms.

No sooner, however, was this great success gained than a question arose known as the Simple Repeal controversy as to whether England, in addition to the repeal of the Acts on which the subordination of the Irish parliament had been based, should not be required expressly to renounce for the future all claim to control Irish legislation. The chief historical importance of this dispute is that it led to the memorable rupture of friendship between Flood and Grattan, each of whom assailed the other with unmeasured but magnificently eloquent invective in the House of Commons.

In 1783, Flood was again returned to the house, this time for Kilbeggan. His view prevailed for a Renunciation Act such as he advocated was ungrudgingly passed by the English parliament of the same year and for a time he regained popularity at the expense of his rival. Flood next (28 November 1783) introduced a reform bill, after first submitting it to the Volunteer Convention.

The bill, which contained no provision for giving the franchise to Roman Catholics, which Flood always opposed, was rejected, ostensibly on the ground that the attitude of the volunteers threatened the freedom of parliament. The volunteers were perfectly loyal to the crown and the connection with England. They carried an address to the king, moved by Flood, expressing the hope that their support of parliamentary reform might be imputed to nothing but a sober and laudable desire to uphold the constitution and to perpetuate the cordial union of both kingdoms. The convention then dissolved, but Flood had desired, in opposition to Grattan, to continue it as a means of putting pressure on parliament for the purpose of obtaining reform.

In Dublin, he was a member of Daly&#x27;s Club.

== British Parliament ==

In 1776, Flood had made an attempt to enter the British House of Commons. In 1783, he tried again, this time successfully. He purchased a seat for Winchester from the duke of Chandos, and for the next seven years he was a member at the same time of both the British and Irish parliaments. He reintroduced, but without success, his reform bill in the Irish House in 1784; supported the movement for protecting Irish industries; but short-sightedly opposed Pitt&#x27;s commercial propositions in 1785. He remained a firm opponent of Roman Catholic emancipation, even defending the penal laws on the ground that after the Revolution, they were not laws of persecution but of political necessity; but after 1786, he does not appear to have attended the parliament in Dublin.

In the House at Westminster, where he refused to enrol himself as a member of either political party, he was not successful: Grattan remarked that Flood, at fifty, was too old a tree to be transplanted. His first speech, in opposition to Charles James Fox&#x27;s India Bill on 3 December 1783, disappointed the expectations aroused by his celebrity. His speech in opposition to the commercial treaty with France in 1787 was, however, well received; and in 1790 he introduced a reform bill which Fox declared to be the best scheme of reform that had yet been proposed, and which in Edmund Burke&#x27;s opinion retrieved Flood&#x27;s reputation. But at the dissolution in the same year, he lost his seat in both parliaments, and he then retired to Farmley, his residence in County Kilkenny, where he remained until his death. He and Frances, who survived until 1815, had no children, and his property passed to a cousin, John Flood; a large bequest to Trinity College Dublin was declared invalid.
