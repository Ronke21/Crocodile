<text>Preity G. Zinta (pronounced ; born 31 January 1975) is an Indian actress and entrepreneur primarily known for her work in Hindi films. After graduating with degrees in English honours and criminal psychology, Zinta made her acting debut in &quot;Dil Se..&quot; in 1998, followed by a role in &quot;Soldier&quot; in the same year. These performances earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, and she was later recognised for her role as a teenage single mother in &quot;Kya Kehna&quot; (2000). She established a career as a leading Hindi film actress of the decade with a variety of character types. Her roles, often deemed culturally defiant, along with her unconventional screen persona won her recognition and several accolades.

Following critically appreciated roles in &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; (2001), &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; (2001), &quot;Dil Hai Tumhaara&quot; (2002), and &quot;Armaan&quot; (2003), Zinta received the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003). She starred in two consecutive annual top-grossing films in India, &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; (2003) and &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004), and was noted for her portrayal of independent, modern Indian women in &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot; (2005) and &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), top-grossing productions in domestic and overseas markets. For her first international role in the Canadian drama &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; (2008) she was awarded the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress and nominated for the Genie Award for Best Actress. She followed this with a hiatus from acting work for several years, with intermittent appearances such as in her self-produced comeback film, &quot;Ishkq in Paris&quot; (2013), which failed to leave a mark.

Zinta is also a social activist, television presenter and stage performer. Between 2004 and 2005, she wrote a series of columns for BBC News Online South Asia. She is the founder of the production company PZNZ Media, a co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Punjab Kings since 2008, and the owner of the South-African T20 Global League cricket team Stellenbosch Kings since 2017. Zinta is known in the Indian media for publicly speaking her mind, and consequently has sparked the occasional controversy. These controversies include her being the sole witness not to retract in court her earlier statements against the Indian mafia during the 2004 Bharat Shah case, for which she was awarded the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Award.

==Early life and background==
Preity Zinta was born on 31 January 1975 into a Himachali Rajput Hindu family from Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh. Her father, Durganand Zinta, was an officer in the Indian Army. He died in a car accident when she was thirteen; the accident also involved her mother, Nilprabha, who was severely injured and consequently remained bedridden for two years. Zinta called the tragic accident and her father&#x27;s death a significant turning point in her life, which forced her to mature rapidly. She has two brothers; Deepankar and Manish, a year older and a year younger, respectively. Deepankar is a commissioned officer in the Indian Army, while Manish lives in California.

Zinta, who describes herself as having been a tomboy as a child, has emphasised her father&#x27;s military background as having given her a lasting impression on how family life was to be conducted. He asserted the importance of discipline and punctuality to the children. She studied at the Convent of Jesus and Mary boarding school in Shimla. Although she confesses to loneliness in the boarding school, she noted that it was compensated by her finding a &quot;...perfect set of friends&quot; there. As a student, she developed a love for literature, particularly the works of William Shakespeare and poetry. According to Zinta, she enjoyed schoolwork and received good grades; in her free time she played sports, especially basketball.

After her schooling at Convent of Jesus and Mary, Zinta enrolled at St. Bede&#x27;s College in Shimla, an affiliated college of Himachal Pradesh University. She graduated with an English honours degree, and then started a graduate programme in psychology. She earned a postgraduate degree in criminal psychology, but later took up modelling. Zinta&#x27;s first television commercial was for &quot;Perk&quot; chocolates, the result of a chance meeting with a director at a friend&#x27;s birthday party in 1996. The director persuaded Zinta to audition for the spot, and she was selected. Afterwards, she appeared in other catalogues and commercials, including one for the soap Liril.

==Acting career==
===Debut and early roles (1998–1999)===
In 1997, Zinta met Shekhar Kapur when she accompanied a friend to an audition in Mumbai, and was asked if she would audition too. Upon seeing her audition, Kapur insisted that she become an actress. She was originally scheduled to make her screen debut in Kapur&#x27;s &quot;Tara Rum Pum Pum&quot; opposite Hrithik Roshan, but the filming was cancelled. She reminisced the experience: &quot;I began to recognise the power of destiny. I had no intention ever to be an actress.&quot; Kapur later recommended her for director Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998), a romantic thriller about a terrorist group in New Delhi. Zinta often recalls that when she joined the film industry her friends teased her that she would typically &quot;wear white saris and dance in the rain&quot;, thereby motivating her to seek unconventional parts.

Zinta commenced shooting for Kundan Shah&#x27;s &quot;Kya Kehna&quot;, whose release was delayed until 2000. The delay of another film, &quot;Soldier&quot; (1998), meant that her first release was &quot;Dil Se..&quot; opposite Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala. She was introduced as Preeti Nair, a middle-class Delhi girl and Khan&#x27;s fiancée. The film was considered an unusual launch for a newcomer, as her role called for only twenty minutes of screen time. However, she was eventually noticed for her role, particularly for the forthright character she played. Her scene with Khan, in which she asked him, &quot;Are you a virgin?&quot;, became well-known, and her portrayal earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Khalid Mohamed of &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot; said that she &quot;radiates confidence and spunk even if she&#x27;s given just scraps of footage&quot;. The film did not attract a wide audience in India but was the first Hindi film to enter the UK&#x27;s top 10 box-office charts. Zinta&#x27;s second release of 1998 was Abbas–Mustan-directed action-drama &quot;Soldier&quot;, one of the biggest commercial hits of the year. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance in both &quot;Dil Se..&quot; and &quot;Soldier&quot;.

Zinta next acted in two Telugu films, &quot;Premante Idera&quot; (1998) and &quot;Raja Kumarudu&quot; (1999). She followed with the leading role in &quot;Sangharsh&quot;, a 1999 thriller directed by Tanuja Chandra and written by Mahesh Bhatt. Zinta portrayed Reet Oberoi, a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer who falls in love with a captured killer played by Akshay Kumar. Having been impressed with Zinta&#x27;s work in &quot;Dil Se..&quot;, Chandra approached her for the part after several leading actresses had refused the offer, which Zinta viewed as an opportunity to expand her range. &quot;Sangharsh&quot; was not a box-office success, although Zinta&#x27;s performance received favourable comments by critics. An article published by &quot;The Tribune&quot; described her performance as &quot;an amazing act&quot; in an &quot;intense film&quot;, documenting her career path thus far with the observation: &quot;She wowed the audiences with her cameo in &quot;Dil Se..&quot;, then she zapped the viewers with her sensuality in &quot;Soldier&quot; and now Preity Zinta is all set to shock everybody with her stark performance [in &quot;Sangharsh&quot;].&quot; Subhash K. Jha reflected in 2013 that &quot;Sangharsh&quot; marked a rare occasion in Hindi cinema at the time where a top male star played a secondary role to the leading lady.

===Breakthrough and career advancement (2000–2002)===
Zinta&#x27;s first role in 2000 was in the drama &quot;Kya Kehna&quot;, which exceeded expectations to emerge a major box-office success. The film addressed themes of single parenthood and teenage pregnancy, and gained Zinta wider recognition from the public as well as film critics. Her portrayal of Priya Bakshi, a teenage single mother who fights social prejudice, earned her several award nominations, including her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards. Anupama Chopra from &quot;India Today&quot; reported that Zinta belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes. Further positive feedback came her way that year for her starring role in the romantic comedy &quot;Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega&quot;. She next appeared alongside Sanjay Dutt and Hrithik Roshan in Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s drama &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot; (2000). Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film dealt with the topic of terrorism and crime; it was an economic success, becoming the year&#x27;s third-highest-grossing release in India. Zinta&#x27;s role was that of Sufiya Parvez, a TV reporter and Roshan&#x27;s childhood love. A review in &quot;The Hindu&quot; noted her for lending colour to an otherwise serious subject matter, and she shared similar sentiments about the character, citing its positive nature within the dark film as having sparked her interest in the part.
In 2001, Zinta was paired with Sunny Deol in the action film &quot;Farz&quot;. Her role was dismissed by critics, and the film failed commercially. Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s family drama &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; was released later that year after a one-year delay due to the trial of producer Bharat Shah and opened to a wide audience. One of the first Hindi films to address the controversial issue of surrogate childbirth, it starred Zinta as Madhubala, a golden-hearted prostitute hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors&#x27; persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai&#x27;s red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. Reviews of the film were varied, but critics singled out Zinta for praise. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote: &quot;Preity Zinta, who clearly has the meatiest part of all, makes the best of it. Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable.&quot;

Two more 2001 releases featured Zinta, including Farhan Akhtar&#x27;s coming-of-age &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot;. Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it focuses on a period of transition in the lives of three young friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). Zinta played Aamir Khan&#x27;s love interest Shalini, who is conflicted about her upcoming, loveless marriage. &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; was popular with critics, some of whom believed it broke new ground with an unusually realistic portrayal of India&#x27;s urban milieu. It was named Best Feature Film in Hindi at the 49th National Film Awards and received the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film. A moderate box-office success in India, it performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by trade analysts to the city-oriented lifestyle it presented. Dinesh Raheja took note of Zinta&#x27;s &quot;casual and appealing acting&quot;, and Sita Menon described her as &quot;beautiful and vibrant, wavering between endearingly naive and confused&quot;. Next followed Deepak Shivdasani&#x27;s &quot;Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke&quot;, a romantic drama co-starring Ajay Devgn and Madhuri Dixit which was commercially and critically unsuccessful.

In 2002, Zinta collaborated once again with director Kundan Shah, as the protagonist in the family drama &quot;Dil Hai Tumhaara&quot;, alongside Rekha, Mahima Chaudhry and Arjun Rampal. She played Shalu, an adopted daughter craving love, a role she identified with due to its rebellious nature. Billed as a star vehicle for Zinta, &quot;Dil Hai Tumhaara&quot; did not succeed financially, but her portrayal was uniformly acclaimed by critics, with those critical of the film marking her presence as its main highlight. Taran Adarsh from entertainment portal &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; noted: &quot;...Preity Zinta, in an author-backed role... steals the show with a sterling performance... Here&#x27;s a performance that is sure to win accolades from the junta and critics whole-heartedly.&quot;

===Established actress (2003–2007)===
Zinta&#x27;s career surged significantly in 2003 as she was the lead in India&#x27;s three highest-grossing films of the year: &quot;The Hero: Love Story of a Spy&quot;, &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; and &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;. &quot;The Hero&quot;, co-starring Sunny Deol and Priyanka Chopra, is an action drama about a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) secret agent on a mission to gather intelligence about terrorist activity from across the border of Kashmir. Zinta played the part of Reshma, a Kashmiri villager who falls in love with the agent and becomes part of this network. The film, involving stunts never seen before in the cinematic history of Bollywood, became the most expensive Hindi film ever produced at the time. The third-highest-grossing film of the year, it was labelled a disappointment against its high production costs.

She next starred in Honey Irani&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Armaan&quot;; the drama is set in a hospital and follows the travails of its personnel and its principal, Dr. Akash (Anil Kapoor), who struggles arduously to sustain the institution financially and enters into a marriage of convenience to save it. Zinta played Akash&#x27;s egocentric, excessively possessive and capricious wife Sonia Kapoor, a role written specially for her and which she considered her best to that point. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Zinta was particularly praised. Khalid Mohamed called her a &quot;peppy scene-stealer, achieving her manic mood swings dexterously&quot;, and Vinayak Chakravorty of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; concluded that she &quot;takes over the script and, indeed, the film&quot; with &quot;a brilliant act&quot;. For her performance, she received nominations for Best Performance in a Negative Role at different award ceremonies, including Filmfare.
Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;, about a developmentally disabled young man (Hrithik Roshan) coming in contact with an alien, followed. Zinta&#x27;s portrayal of Nisha, a young woman whom Roshan befriends and falls in love with, was deemed &quot;fresh and inspired&quot; by &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Regarded as the &quot;most novel Bollywood movie of the year&quot; by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, the film emerged as India&#x27;s most popular film of the year with a domestic total of . It went on to spawn two superhero sequels&quot;Krrish&quot; and &quot;Krrish 3&quot;making it the first of the &quot;Krrish&quot; film series, to which Zinta did not proceed.

Set in New York City, Nikhil Advani&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; starred Zinta as Naina Catherine Kapur, an insecure and irritable Indian-American who falls for a man with a fatal heart disease (Shah Rukh Khan). The film earned over worldwide: the second-biggest hit of the year after &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; in India and the top-grossing Hindi film overseas. Critics received &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; favourably, and Ram Kamal Mukherjee of &quot;Stardust&quot; asserted that it exclusively rested on Zinta&#x27;s &quot;astounding performance&quot;, noting her for having &quot;skillfully handled the hues of the complex character&quot;. At the 49th Filmfare Awards, Zinta received two Best Actress nominations: one for &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;, which was named Best Film, and another for &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;, for which she won the award, in addition to accolades from other functions, including IIFA and Stardust.

In 2004, Zinta played TV journalist Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar&#x27;s war drama &quot;Lakshya&quot;, alongside Hrithik Roshan. The film is based on the historical events of the 1999 Kargil War, and Zinta&#x27;s character is modelled after Barkha Dutt, the only female reporter who covered the conflict. She called it the toughest film she had worked on and said it made her respect journalists. To provide an accurate portrayal, she watched a number of Dutt&#x27;s television shows and read books on the conflict. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; Namrata Joshi of &quot;Outlook&quot; likened her to &quot;a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest&quot;, and Rediff.com&#x27;s Rajeev Pai observed that despite a good part, she only &quot;does a fairly decent job of it without ever being spectacular&quot;. &quot;Lakshya&quot; failed to attract an audience, grossing against its budget.

For the lead part in his cross-border romance &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004), Yash Chopra was looking for an actress whose &quot;look and personality could be transformed&quot;. Having identified this opportunity in Zinta, who was mostly known for playing westernised characters, he cast her in the title role of Zaara Haayat Khan, a feisty Pakistani woman whose love story with Indian officer Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) spans three decades amid trials and tribulations. Highly anticipated pre-release, the film had a strong international release, including a screening at the Berlin International Film Festival, and was named Best Film at major Indian award functions. With revenues of over , it was that year&#x27;s top-grossing Hindi film both in India and abroad. Zinta&#x27;s part required her to master the fine nuances of the Urdu language. Though excited at first, she later &quot;got knots in her stomach&quot; worrying about her performance, but Chopra assured her. Her work resulted in a fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination, among others. Jitesh Pillai wrote of her &quot;tremendous restraint&quot;, and Avijit Ghosh of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; likewise believed she had delivered her most nuanced performance. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; hailed her as &quot;the most interesting young actress of her generation&quot;. &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was Zinta&#x27;s second highest-grossing film and third major success in two consecutive years.

Zinta starred opposite Govinda in the 2005 folk comedy &quot;Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen&quot;, a production that had been delayed since 2002. The film garnered negative reviews and poor box office returns, and Subhash K. Jha found Zinta&#x27;s work to be incompatible with her screen image and acting style. Critics and moviegoers were more appreciative that year of Siddharth Anand&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;, which saw Zinta and Saif Ali Khan as a contemporary cohabiting Indian couple in Australia dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. Produced on a big budget by Yash Raj Films, it was the first Indian feature filmed entirely in Australia and became the year&#x27;s highest-grossing Indian production outside of India and overall third-highest-grossing Hindi film, earning . Zinta received a number of Best Actress nominations for playing the protagonist Ambar Malhotra, a single modern young woman who leaves India to make her own life in Melbourne and works as a radio host while studying medicine. Devyani Srivastava of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; considered the independent, strong-minded character of Ambar to be a rare Hindi film heroine, and Taran Adarsh argued that Zinta had given &quot;her most accomplished performance to date&quot;. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted Ambar&#x27;s negative shades but admired Zinta&#x27;s positive personality, by which she remains likable even despite uncharitable traits in her characters.
Zinta received further success in 2006, starring in Karan Johar&#x27;s drama &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, Abhishek Bachchan, and Amitabh Bachchan. The film became one of the biggest box-office hits in India, earning , and grossed over abroadthe biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was Zinta&#x27;s fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. Revolving around two unhappily married couples in New York, the film featured Zinta as Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor whose husband begins an adulterous affair with a family acquaintance. She described the part as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; polarised critics, but &quot;The Indian Express&quot; approved of Zinta&#x27;s effort, noting her for having &quot;walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness&quot;. Other reviews questioned the limited length of her role. In later years, &quot;Filmfare&quot; and &quot;Verve&quot; lauded the character for breaking stereotypes of screen portrayals of married women in Hindi films.

Zinta next appeared in Shirish Kunder&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Jaan-E-Mann&quot; (2006). She played Piya, the cynosure of two men in the United States (Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar). The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its eventual box office profit was poor. Despite being mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, she was complimented on her performance and appearance. She said the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot;, as &quot;Jaan-E-Mann&quot; was &quot;easy, happy and much more simple&quot;. Even less successful was her next turn as British Pakistani woman Alvira Khan in her third project with Yash Raj Films, the musical comedy &quot;Jhoom Barabar Jhoom&quot; (2007), co-starring Abhishek Bachchan, Bobby Deol and Lara Dutta. The film was a commercial failure in India and critics panned her performance; &quot;The Times of India&quot; described her as &quot;too plastic&quot; and Rediff.com concluded, &quot;From accent to emotion, Preity is plain and simple insufferable in this film.&quot;

===Professional expansion (2007–2008)===
Following the failure of two of her commercial releases, Zinta decided to venture into art films, a movement of neo-realistic films known in India as parallel cinema. She acted alongside Amitabh Bachchan in her first English-language film, Rituparno Ghosh&#x27;s film-within-a-film drama &quot;The Last Lear&quot; (2007). Zinta played Shabnam, a struggling film actress working on a new project opposite Shakespearean actor Harish Mishra (Bachchan) in the midst of a turbulent relationship with her possessive husband. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing that she &quot;gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image to take away from the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman&quot;. Sukanya Verma called Zinta &quot;palpably vulnerable&quot; but lamented the English dialogue, finding it distracting &quot;from the seriousness of the situation&quot;. &quot;The Last Lear&quot; was named the Best English Film at the 55th National Film Awards. Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke positively of her experiment with the genre, confessing, &quot;I did think with art films that they don&#x27;t pay you, they don&#x27;t feed you, but I was wrong, and I&#x27;m so happy to be here.&quot;

Zinta next starred in Samir Karnik&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; (2008), a three-chapter road movie about two film students who, as part of an assignment, travel across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan&#x27;s war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role Zinta attended Anupam Kher&#x27;s acting school, &quot;Actor Prepares&quot; to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears the old-fashioned way, and not in starting a debate. He succeedsmainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary womenthis may be her coming of age as an actress.&quot;
In the same year she played the leading role of Chand in Deepa Mehta&#x27;s Canadian film &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;, a Punjabi-language mystical drama based on the true story of a young Indian woman who, after an arranged marriage to a non-resident Indian man from Canada, migrates to Toronto and becomes a victim of severe domestic abuse. Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with to fulfill her desire for &quot;a new kind of acting challenge&quot;. To prepare for the part, she studied extensively the subject of domestic violence and took a crash course in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her. She confessed to not being able to emotionally disconnect from the part during the making of the film: &quot;I never knew a character would affect me so deeply. I&#x27;ve become completely withdrawn and introspective... I can&#x27;t snap out of the character.&quot; She eventually called it her most challenging project, as it helped her &quot;shed everything that Preity Zinta was about&quot;. &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; was first screened at several film festivals and garnered career-best reviews for Zinta. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of her &quot;stunning psychological transformation&quot; in the part and Will Sloan of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; labelled her &quot;a revelation&quot;. Her performance earned her the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 2008 Chicago International Film Festival, for &quot;her strong yet subtle performance as a woman struggling to keep her dreams despite brutal realities&quot;. She was also nominated for the Genie Award for Best Actress.

===Hiatus and occasional returns (2009–present)===
Following &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;, Zinta took a two-year sabbatical from films, later explaining that she had chosen to focus on her work with her cricket team. In 2011, she launched her own production company, PZNZ Media. Two years later and following numerous delays, she starred in her first film under the bannerthe Prem Raj-directed romantic comedy &quot;Ishkq in Paris&quot;, which she also co-wrote. An Indo-French collaboration, the film saw Zinta as a half-Indian half-French Parisian woman alongside Rhehan Malliek and Isabelle Adjani. Zinta&#x27;s role required her to learn French and follow a strict diet and fitness regime, for which she hired the services of celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson. Whilst the film bombed at the box office and received mostly negative reviews, Zinta&#x27;s performance attracted a mixed critical reception. Sonia Chopra of Sify called her &quot;hugely likeable&quot;, and added that she is a &quot;good actress, astute producer and... writer&quot;. Shilpa Jamkhandikar from &quot;Deccan Herald&quot;, critical of both the film and Zinta&#x27;s work, concluded a scathing review by calling it &quot;a mediocre film, one that was supposed to showcase one of our favourite leading ladies, but instead just shows us what a shadow of her past she&#x27;s become&quot;.

Following a five-year sabbatical, Zinta starred opposite Sunny Deol as an aggressive Varanasi-based wife in Neeraj Pathak&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Bhaiaji Superhit&quot; (2018). Ajit Duara of &quot;Open&quot; magazine called the film a &quot;rude, sexist, and completely mixed-up farce&quot; and bemoaned that the &quot;once vivacious [Zinta] appears completely disinterested in her surroundings and in her co-actors&quot;. In 2020, Zinta appeared alongside Vir Das in an episode of the American sitcom &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot;, titled &quot;The Magic Motor Inn&quot;; she was set to reprise her role in a spin-off series, centered around her character&#x27;s family, but it eventually did not materialise.

After another hiatus, Zinta will return to Hindi cinema with &quot;Lahore 1947&quot;, a period drama film directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and co-starring Sunny Deol. The film will be produced by her &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; co-star Aamir Khan 

==Other work==
===Column writing===
In 2004, Zinta joined a group of South Asian commentators for BBC News Online. She expressed joy at participating in the project, saying, &quot;I am pretty outspoken and have my own view on every subject. So it will be a good platform for me to air my views.&quot; Her first column, &quot;The changing face of Bollywood&quot;, published in January 2004, discussed the evolution of Bollywood in the past decade. The column became one of the site&#x27;s ten most read stories of the day. In her second column, &quot;Odds stacked against Indian women&quot;, Zinta analysed the eve teasing phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it. She wrote, &quot;Incidents like these take away a woman&#x27;s dignity, her space and her freedom... why the state is so helpless in protecting the women. Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?&quot; The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against abuse of Indian women. Her third column, &quot;The darkness that all actors fear&quot;, was a more personal column and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled &quot;Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand&quot;, described her two near-death experiences in late 2004.

===Stage performances and television presenting===
Zinta has taken part in several stage shows and world tours since 2001. Her first world tour, a series of concerts called &quot;Craze 2001&quot;, was performed across the US alongside Anil Kapoor, Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Gracy Singh. The show faced early cancellation due to the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the team prepared to return to India as soon as possible. However, the shows continued successfully in Canada. In 2002, she participated in the show &quot;From India With Love&quot; in the UK, along with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It took place at two outdoor venues, Manchester&#x27;s Old Trafford and London&#x27;s Hyde Park, with more than 100,000 spectators.

Zinta&#x27;s largest world tour was in 2004, when she joined a group of stars (Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, Saif Ali Khan, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra) in the &quot;Temptation 2004&quot; tour. Showcased in more than 22 countries across the world, it became Bollywood&#x27;s most prominent international concert. In 2006, Zinta was part of the &quot;Heat 2006&quot; world tour, along with Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, Sushmita Sen and Celina Jaitley. &quot;The Unforgettable Tour&quot; (2008) saw Zinta performing with the Bachchan family and Ritesh Deshmukh in a forty-day show staged in eleven cities across North America, Europe and the Caribbean. In December 2012 Zinta returned to the stage with the &quot;Temptation Reloaded&quot; concert in Jakarta (joined by Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji and Bipasha Basu).

In 2011, Zinta made her television debut as the host of the show &quot;Guinness World Records – Ab India Todega&quot; on Colors Channel. An Indian version of Guinness Book of World Records, the show premiered on 18 March to an audience measurement of 3.3 rating points, which made it occupy the seventh position on the chart of celebrity-driven reality shows on Hindi entertainment channels. In a four-star review for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, critic Rachana Dubey wrote, &quot;Preity is a riot. She&#x27;s vivacious and knows exactly when she needs to be serious and when she can crack jokes.&quot; Later that year Zinta started hosting the celebrity-based chat show &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal with PZ&quot;, shot at her own penthouse in Mumbai and broadcast on the newly launched channel UTV Stars. The first episode aired on 3 September. In 2015, Zinta featured as a talent judge for the seventh season of the dance reality show &quot;Nach Baliye&quot;.

===Humanitarian work===
During her years in the film industry, Zinta has been involved with different charitable organisations and has particularly supported women&#x27;s causes in India, for instance protesting against female infanticide. She has also participated in AIDS awareness drives and campaigns to clean up Mumbai.
Along with other Bollywood stars, Zinta performed at the &quot;HELP! Telethon Concert&quot; in 2005 to raise money for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The following year, as an ambassador of the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Movement, Zinta attended a blood donation camp organised by the Rotary Club of Delhi and the Godfrey Phillips Awards. She lent her support to the cause of women&#x27;s empowerment and promoted blood donation. She said, &quot;Donating blood doesn&#x27;t kill one but goes on to save somebody&#x27;s life... Once blood is donated it becomes universal and might be used by anyone in need, irrespective of community, caste or region. It binds people together.&quot;

In 2007, as part of the NDTV show &quot;Jai Jawan&quot;, Zinta visited Hisar, Haryana, where she spent a day at the army training base to boost the morale of the jawan troops and met children with disabilities at a special school maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of street children for the non-governmental organisation Khushi. In December she joined the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human trafficking in India. She spoke on behalf of awareness against the practice, the need for protection and rehabilitation for those rescued from it, and punishment for perpetrators. In 2009, on her 34th birthday, Zinta adopted 34 girls from the Mother Miracle orphanage in Rishikesh and took the responsibility of financially supporting their education, food and clothing. She expressed her excitement at doing so and recounted her full commitment to their upbringing.

In January 2010 Zinta was appointed the brand ambassador of The Loomba Trust, an organisation that works for the welfare of widows and their children. She said, having lost her father at thirteen, she could relate to the problems faced by widowed women. Later in the year, she joined the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as their Goodwill Ambassador in India, to promote public awareness on HIV prevention, treatment and support, with emphasis on women and children, and combat discrimination against it. Speaking of her appointment, Zinta expressed hope to be &quot;the voice for the voiceless&quot; and bring about a &quot;transformation in the minds of people&quot; through collaborative work. In October 2010 Zinta was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of East London. It was awarded in honour of both her cultural contribution and her humanitarian work, with the citation describing her as &quot;an international actress, pioneering star of Hindi cinema and devoted humanitarian. Preity has carved a path for women to follow.&quot;

===Ownership of cricket teams===
Along with Ness Wadia, Mohit Burman and others, Zinta acquired ownership rights in 2008 for the Mohali-based Twenty20 cricket team of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The group paid $76million for the franchise and named the team Kings XI Punjab (it was renamed Punjab Kings in 2021). Until 2009, Zinta was the only woman to own an IPL team, and was the league&#x27;s youngest owner. She has been involved with launching ticket sales and promoting the team. She said, &quot;My involvement with the team is total. I am extremely passionate about our team and I do believe that I am the team&#x27;s good luck factor, so I want to be there for everything.&quot; In September 2017, she became the owner of the Stellenbosch Kings franchise team of South Africa&#x27;s Mzansi Super League. Further business expansion took place in 2021 as Zinta and her Punjab Kings partners bought Saint Lucia&#x27;s representative team in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), which was rebranded as Saint Lucia Kings.

==Personal life==
Zinta used to visit her native town Shimla when she was not busy shooting. In 2006, she moved into her own home in Mumbai. She does not identify with any particular religion. In an interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;, she commented: &quot;I believe in good deeds, in karma, I don&#x27;t believe in going to temples. For me, religion is very personal. It&#x27;s all about having faith... We have heard and read that all religions are equal. Now I am increasingly believing in this.&quot; She narrowly escaped death twice in late 2004: first after an explosion at a Temptation concert in Colombo, Sri Lanka; and second during the Indian Ocean earthquake.
Zinta has been the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the Bharat Shah case, she testified against the Indian mafia. Bharat Shah, the financer of &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot;, was arrested in 2000 for having connections with Chhota Shakeel, a Mumbai underworld boss. Unlike several of her colleagues, Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received extortion threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given witness protection and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become hostile to the prosecution. Her actions met with nationwide public resonance and applause. Consequently, she was the first recipient of Godfrey&#x27;s Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the &quot;courageous act&quot; of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, &quot;To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and you get over it, then you can be called brave. I am human. It is not that I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far.&quot; Since 2006, Zinta has been the brand ambassador for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery awards.

Tabloids have often linked Zinta romantically with other Bollywood stars, but she has strongly denied any such rumours. In 2000, Zinta began dating model Marc Robinson. They separated the following year, and according to Zinta remained on good terms. Zinta dated the Bombay Dyeing heir, businessman Ness Wadia from February 2005 until May 2009. Their relationship was often reported on by the media, with frequent speculation about an engagement or a break-up. On 13 June 2014, Zinta filed a complaint with the Mumbai police against Ness Wadia alleging he had molested, threatened, and abused her at an IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 30 May. Wadia denied the allegations. In 2018, the Bombay High Court quashed this complaint after the issue was amicably settled.

On 29 February 2016, Zinta married her American partner Gene Goodenough at a private ceremony in Los Angeles. Goodenough is Senior Vice-president for Finance at NLine Energy, a US-based hydroelectric power company. Zinta moved to Los Angeles following the marriage; she visits India on a frequent basis. In 2021, she and her husband became parents to twins, a boy and a girl, through surrogacy.

On 25 February 2025, Zinta faced a major backlash from the Indian National Congress, after the party posted on their X(formerly Twitter) handle about an ₹18 crore loan written off from a co-operative bank and had handed over her social media accounts to the Bharatiya Janata Party. In response, Zinta retaliated by tweeting &quot;I operate my social media accounts my self and shame on you for promoting FAKE NEWS! No one wrote off anything or any loan for me.&quot; The tweet was subsequently labelled as fake. The fake news came days after Zinta express frustration about cynicism from the nation stating that &quot;If you appreciate your PM then you are a bhakt(follower) &amp; god forbid, if you are a proud Hindu or Indian then you are an Andh Bhakt (blind follower)&quot;.

==Media image and artistry==
Zinta is known in the Indian media for her straightforward nature and for honestly expressing her opinions in public, be it about her on-screen or off-screen life or her raising a voice against social injustice. While she does not believe she is &quot;as tough as people portray [her] to be&quot;, she asserts having no qualms about speaking her mind, even if faced with surmounting opposition, as long as she stands &quot;by what&#x27;s right&quot;. These features were noted during the Bharat Shah case, when she testified against the underworld; following this incident she was often called by journalists &quot;the only man in Bollywood&quot;, a label she was unhappy with for its underlying misogynist connotations. Film actor Amitabh Bachchan, describing her as &quot;frank and painfully honest&quot;, lauded her &quot;drive and guts in a world that can be most cruel to a single girl&quot;. Author and columnist Shobhaa De, while commending her for lodging a molestation complaint against Ness Wadia in 2014, expressed concern regarding Zinta&#x27;s repeated quest for justice, believing it could eventually play against her: &quot;India is not terribly kind to strong-willed, outspoken women who are dubbed &#x27;trouble makers&#x27; if they dare to raise their voices, especially against men. Zinta is such a woman.&quot;
The media have cited her characteristic dimple as her trademark. At the beginning of her career, the press often described her as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta&#x27;s energetic nature extends from her real life into her screen appearances and is an integral part of her technique. Discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote of Zinta: &quot;What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting.&quot;

Director Tanuja Chandra ascribed Zinta&#x27;s screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, commenting, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t act, she&#x27;s so real that you just can&#x27;t look away from her.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; (2001) for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that &quot;there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does&quot;. Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two films, believes she is an actress who &quot;can mould herselfthe way she speaks, works and her body languageand adapt herself to roles&quot;, while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of the 2000 film &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot;) credits her with the ability to &quot;make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation.&quot; In a review of &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, &quot;While Preity Zinta isn&#x27;t the subtlest actress, she&#x27;s quite a comediennefor a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you might have to go back to Natalie Wood.&quot; American critic Derek Elley considers her to be &quot;one of Bollywood&#x27;s best pure actresses.&quot;

Zinta&#x27;s variety of characters, such as &quot;Dil Se&quot; (1998), &quot;Sangharsh&quot; (1999), &quot;Kya Kehna&quot; (2000), &quot;Chori Chori Chupke Chupke&quot; (2001), &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot; (2005) and &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), gained her a reputation for playing roles that go against Indian traditional mores. These roles were cited by critics as having contributed to a new image for Indian screen women by means of departure from the conventional parts previously played by leading actresses in mainstream Hindi films. Karan Johar describes her as &quot;a new-wave actress&quot; who has the advantage of working at a time when &quot;films portray a woman who knows her mind&quot;. The character of Preeti from &quot;Dil Se&quot; was noted by gender scholar Janell Hobson as one that breaks the stereotypes that Westerners have of South Asian women. Author Monika Mehta notes the similarity between Zinta&#x27;s public image as an independent and opinionated woman and her culturally defiant character in &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;. According to Jennifer Thomas, who analysed Zinta&#x27;s roles for a chapter in the book &quot;Once Upon a Time in Bollywood&quot; (2007), Zinta &quot;resists patriarchal constraints through her modern lifestyle and the controversial roles she chooses&quot;.

Zinta is one of the best-known celebrities in India; at her career peak she was one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s most celebrated stars and was acknowledged for having managed a career without any traditional assistance or family relations in the film industry. She featured in Box Office India&#x27;s top actress listing for seven years and ranked first for two consecutive years (2003–2004). In 2003, Zinta appeared in the number one spot on Rediff.com&#x27;s &quot;Top Bollywood Female Stars&quot;. She was ranked second for the following three years. She has been featured frequently on other Rediff.com lists, including &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Most Beautiful Actresses&quot;, &quot;Bollywood&#x27;s Best Dressed Women&quot; and &quot;Women of Many Faces&quot;. Between 2006 and 2008 Zinta made three consecutive appearances at the Cannes Film Festival. At first she attended the 2006 Film Festival along with filmmaker Karan Johar to represent the Hindi film industry and promote &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot;, returning in later years as the brand ambassador of Chopard, the maker of luxury watches and jewellery.

In September 2006 the UK magazine &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; ranked her among &quot;Asia&#x27;s Sexiest Women&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine selected her as one of the candidates for its list of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. She was the only Indian actress nominated for the poll and eventually did not make it to the final list, ranked at 144. This was followed, however, by a marked period of decline in her popularity when she restricted her work in films, which was further decreased with the debacle of her self-produced comeback vehicle. Film journalists like Khalid Mohamed and Subhash K. Jha have written columns in which they lament her absence from the movies and encourage her to return to acting.

<text>English as a second or foreign language refers to the use of English by individuals whose native language is different, commonly among students learning to speak and write English. Variably known as English as a foreign language (EFL), English as a second language (ESL), English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), English as an additional language (EAL), or English as a new language (ENL), these terms denote the study of English in environments where it is not the dominant language. Programs such as ESL are designed as academic courses to instruct non-native speakers in English proficiency, encompassing both learning in English-speaking nations and abroad.

Teaching methodologies include teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in non-English-speaking countries, teaching English as a second language (TESL) in English-speaking nations, and teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) worldwide. These terms, while distinct in scope, are often used interchangeably, reflecting the global spread and diversity of English language education. Critically, recent developments in terminology, such as English-language learner (ELL) and English Learners (EL), emphasize the cultural and linguistic diversity of students, promoting inclusive educational practices across different contexts.

Methods for teaching English encompass a broad spectrum, from traditional classroom settings to innovative self-directed study programs, integrating approaches that enhance language acquisition and cultural understanding. The efficacy of these methods hinges on adapting teaching strategies to students&#x27; proficiency levels and contextual needs, ensuring comprehensive language learning in today&#x27;s interconnected world.

== Definition and purposes ==
The aspect in which EFL is taught is referred to as teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL), teaching English as a second language (TESL) or teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). Technically, TEFL refers to English language teaching in a country where English is not the official language, TESL refers to teaching English to non-native English speakers in a native English-speaking country and TESOL covers both. In practice, however, each of these terms tends to be used more generically across the full field. TEFL is more widely used in the United Kingdom and TESL or TESOL in the United States.

== Usage ==
The term &quot;ESL&quot; has been seen by some to indicate that English would be of subordinate importance; for example, where English is used as a lingua franca in a multilingual country. The term can be a misnomer for some students who have learned several languages before learning English. The terms &quot;English language learners&quot; (ELL), and, more recently, &quot;English learners&quot; (EL), have been used instead, and the students&#x27; native languages and cultures are considered important.

== Educational approach ==

Methods of learning English are highly variable, depending on the student&#x27;s level of English proficiency and the manner and setting in which they are taught, which can range from required classes in school to self-directed study at home, or a blended combination of both. Teaching technique plays an important role in the performance of English language acquisition as a foreign language. In some programs, educational materials (including spoken lectures and written assignments) are provided in a mixture of English, and the student&#x27;s native language. In other programs, educational materials are always in English, but the vocabulary, grammar, and context clues may be modified to be more easily understood by students with varying levels of comprehension. Adapting comprehension, insight-oriented repetitions, and recasts are some of the methods used in training. However, without proper cultural immersion (social learning grounds) the associated language habits and reference points (internal mechanisms) of the host country are not completely transferred through these programs. The major engines that influence the language are the United States and the United Kingdom and they both have assimilated the language differently so they differ in expressions and usage. This is found to a great extent primarily in pronunciation and vocabulary. Variants of the English language also exist in both of these countries (e.g. African American Vernacular English).

== Influence ==
The English language has a great reach and influence, and English is taught all over the world. In countries where English is not usually a native language, there are two distinct models for teaching English: educational programs for students who want to move to English-speaking countries, and other programs for students who do not intend to move but who want to understand English content for the purposes of education, entertainment, employment or conducting international business. The differences between these two models of English language education have grown larger over time, and teachers focusing on each model have used different terminology, received different training, and formed separate professional associations. English is also taught as a second language for recent immigrants to English-speaking countries, which faces separate challenges because the students in one class may speak many different native languages.

==Terminology and types==
The many acronyms and abbreviations used in the field of English teaching and learning may be confusing and the following technical definitions may have their currency contested upon various grounds. The precise usage, including the different use of the terms ESL and ESOL in different countries, is described below. These terms are most commonly used in relation to teaching and learning English as a second language, but they may also be used in relation to demographic information.

English language teaching (ELT) is a widely used teacher-centered term, as in the English language teaching divisions of large publishing houses, ELT training, etc. Teaching English as a second language (TESL), teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), and teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) are also used.

Other terms used in this field include English as an international language (EIL), English as a lingua franca (ELF), English for special purposes and English for specific purposes (ESP), and English for academic purposes (EAP). Those who are learning English are often referred to as English language learners (ELL). The learners of the English language are of two main groups. The first group includes the learners learning English as their second language i.e. the second language of their country and the second group includes those who learn English as a totally foreign language i.e. a language that is not spoken in any part of their country.

===English outside English-speaking countries===
&quot;EFL&quot;, English as a foreign language, indicates the teaching of English in a non–English-speaking region. The study can occur either in the student&#x27;s home country, as part of the normal school curriculum or otherwise, or, for the more privileged minority, in an anglophone country that they visit as a sort of educational tourist, particularly immediately before or after graduating from university. &quot;TEFL&quot; is the teaching of English as a foreign language; note that this sort of instruction can take place in any country, English-speaking or not. Typically, EFL is learned either to pass exams as a necessary part of one&#x27;s education or for career progression while one works for an organization or business with an international focus. EFL may be part of the state school curriculum in countries where English has no special status (what linguistic theorist Braj Kachru calls the &quot;expanding circle countries&quot;); it may also be supplemented by lessons paid for privately. Teachers of EFL generally assume that students are literate in their mother tongue. The &quot;Chinese EFL Journal&quot; and &quot;Iranian EFL Journal&quot; are examples of international journals dedicated to specifics of English language learning within countries where English is used as a foreign language.

===English within English-speaking countries===

The other broad grouping is the use of English within the English-speaking world. In what Braj Kachru calls &quot;the inner circle&quot;, i.e., countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this use of English is generally by refugees, immigrants, and their children. It also includes the use of English in &quot;outer circle&quot; countries, often former British colonies and the Philippines, where English is an official language even if it is not spoken as a mother tongue by a majority of the population.

In the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand this use of English is called &quot;ESL&quot; (English as a second language). This term has been criticized on the grounds that many learners already speak more than one language. A counter-argument says that the word &quot;a&quot; in the phrase &quot;a second language&quot; means there is no presumption that English is &quot;the&quot; second acquired language (see also &quot;Second language&quot;). &quot;TESL&quot; is the teaching of English as a second language. There are also other terms that it may be referred to in the US including ELL (English Language Learner) and CLD (Culturally and Linguistically Diverse).

In the UK and Ireland, the term ESL has been replaced by &quot;ESOL&quot; (English for speakers of other languages). In these countries &quot;TESOL&quot; (teaching English to speakers of other languages) is normally used to refer to teaching English only to this group. In the UK and Ireland, the term &quot;EAL&quot; (English as an additional language) is used, rather than ESOL, when talking about primary and secondary schools, in order to clarify that English is not the students&#x27; first language, but their second or third. The term ESOL is used to describe English language learners who are above statutory school age.

Other acronyms were created to describe the person rather than the language to be learned. The term Limited English proficiency (LEP) was first used in 1975 by the Lau Remedies following a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. ELL (English Language Learner), used by United States governments and school systems, was created by James Crawford of the Institute for Language and Education Policy in an effort to label learners positively, rather than ascribing a deficiency to them. Recently, some educators have shortened this to EL – English Learner.

Typically, a student learns this sort of English to function in the new host country, e.g., within the school system (if a child), to find and hold down a job (if an adult), or to perform the necessities of daily life (cooking, taking a cab/public transportation, or eating in a restaurant, etc.). The teaching of it does not presuppose literacy in the mother tongue. It is usually paid for by the host government to help newcomers settle into their adopted country, sometimes as part of an explicit citizenship program. It is technically possible for ESL to be taught not in the host country, but in, for example, a refugee camp, as part of a pre-departure program sponsored by the government soon to receive new potential citizens. In practice, however, this is extremely rare.
Particularly in Canada and Australia, the term &quot;ESD&quot; (English as a second dialect) is used alongside ESL, usually in reference to programs for Aboriginal peoples in Canada or Australians. The term refers to the use of standard English by speakers of a creole or non-standard variety. It is often grouped with ESL as &quot;ESL/ESD&quot;.
the

===Umbrella terms===
All these ways of denoting the teaching of English can be bundled together into an umbrella term. Unfortunately, not all of the English teachers in the world would agree on just only a simple single term(s). The term &quot;TESOL&quot; (teaching English to speakers of other languages) is used in American English to include both TEFL and TESL. This is also the case in Canada as well as in Australia and New Zealand. British English uses &quot;ELT&quot; (English language teaching), because TESOL has a different, more specific meaning; see above.

==Difficulties for learners==

Language teaching practice often assumes that most of the difficulties that learners face in the study of English are the consequence of the degree to which their native language differs from English (a contrastive analysis approach). A native speaker of Chinese, for example, may face many more difficulties than a native speaker of German, because German is more closely related to English than Chinese. This may be true for anyone of any mother tongue (also called the first language, normally abbreviated L1) setting out to learn any other language (called a target language, second language or L2). See also second-language acquisition (SLA) for mixed evidence from linguistic research.

Language learners often produce errors of syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation thought to result from the influence of their L1, such as mapping its grammatical patterns inappropriately onto the L2, pronouncing certain sounds incorrectly or with difficulty, and confusing items of vocabulary known as false friends. This is known as L1 transfer or &quot;language interference&quot;. However, these transfer effects are typically stronger for beginners&#x27; language production, and SLA research has highlighted many errors which cannot be attributed to the L1, as they are attested in learners of many language backgrounds (for example, failure to apply 3rd person present singular -s to verbs, as in &#x27;he make&#x27; not &#x27;he make&quot;s&quot;&#x27;).

Some students may have problems due to certain words being usable, unchanged, as different parts of speech. For example, the word &quot;suffering&quot; in &quot;I am suffering terribly&quot; is a verb, but in &quot;My suffering is terrible&quot; is a and confounding matters is the fact that both of these sentences express the same idea, using the same words. Other students might have problems due to the prescribing and proscribing nature of rules in the language formulated by amateur grammarians rather than ascribing to the functional and descriptive nature of languages evidenced from distribution. For example, a cleric, Robert Lowth, introduced the rule to never end a sentence with a preposition, inspired by Latin grammar, through his book &quot;A Short Introduction to English Grammar&quot;. The inconsistencies brought from Latin language standardization of English language led to classifying and sub-classifying an otherwise simple language structure. Like many alphabetic writing systems, English also has incorporated the principle that graphemic units should correspond to the phonemic units; however, the fidelity to the principle is compromised, compared to an exemplar language like the Finnish language. This is evident in the Oxford English Dictionary; for many years it experimented with various spellings of &#x27;SIGN&#x27; to attain a fidelity with the said principle, among which were SINE, SEGN, and SYNE, and through the diachronic mutations eventually settled on &quot;SIGN&quot;. Cultural differences in communication styles and preferences are also significant. For example, a study among Chinese ESL students revealed that preference for not using the tense marking on verb present in the morphology of their mother tongue made it difficult for them to express time-related sentences in English. Another study looked at Chinese ESL students and British teachers and found that the Chinese learners did not see classroom &#x27;discussion and interaction&#x27; type of communication for learning as important but placed a heavy emphasis on teacher-directed lectures.

===Pronunciation===
English contains a number of sounds and sound distinctions not present in some other languages. These sounds can include vowels and consonants, as well as diphthongs and other morphemes. Speakers of languages without these sounds may have problems both with hearing and pronouncing them. For example:
* The interdentals, (&#x27;three&#x27;) and (&#x27;thee&#x27;), both written as &quot;th&quot;, are relatively rare in other languages.
* Phonemic contrast of with (&quot;beat&quot; vs &quot;bit&quot; vowels), of with (&quot;fool&quot; vs &quot;full&quot; vowels), and of with (&quot;bet&quot; vs &quot;bat&quot; vowels) is rare outside northwestern Europe, so unusual mergers or exotic pronunciations such as for &quot;bit&quot; may arise. Note that [bɪt] is a pronunciation often used in England and Wales for &quot;bet&quot;, and also in some dialects of American English. See Northern cities vowel shift, and Pin-pen merger.
* Native speakers of Japanese, Korean, and most Chinese dialects have difficulty distinguishing and , as do speakers of certain Caribbean Spanish dialects when these sounds are at the ends of syllables, a phenomenon known as lambdacism, which is one form of lallation.
* Native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish or Galician, and Ukrainian may pronounce -like sounds where a , , or , respectively, would be expected, as those sounds often or almost always follow this process in their native languages, what is known as debuccalization.
* Native speakers of Arabic, Tagalog, Japanese, Korean, and important dialects of all current Iberian Romance languages (including most of Spanish) have difficulty distinguishing and , what is known as betacism.
* Native speakers of almost all of Brazilian Portuguese, of some African Portuguese registers, of Portuguese-derived creole languages, some dialects of Swiss German, and several pontual processes in several Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Ukrainian, and many dialects of other languages, have instances of or always becoming at the end of a syllable in a given context, so that &quot;milk&quot; may be variously pronounced as . This is present in some English known as but may be shunned as substandard or bring confusion in others.
* Native speakers of many widely spoken languages (including Dutch and all the Romance ones) distinguish voiceless stop pairs from their voiced counterparts merely by their sound (and in Iberian Romance languages, the latter trio does not even need to be stopped, so its native speakers unconsciously pronounce them as , , and voiced fricatives or approximants in the very same mouth instead much or most of the time, that native English speakers may erroneously interpret as the or , and , , or of their language). In English, German, Danish, and some other languages, though, the main distinguishing feature in the case of initial or stressed stopped voiceless consonants from their voiced counterparts is that they are aspirated (unless if immediately preceded or followed by ), while the voiced ones are not. As a result, much of the non-English and will sound to native English ears as and instead (i.e. p⁠&quot;arking&quot; may sound more like b⁠&quot;arking&quot;).
* Ukrainian, Turkish and Azeri speakers may have trouble distinguishing between and as both pronunciations are used interchangeably for the letter &quot;v&quot; in those languages.

Languages may also differ in syllable structure; English allows for a cluster of up to three consonants before the vowel and five after it (e.g. &quot;strengths&quot;, &quot;straw&quot;, &quot;desks&quot;, &quot;glimpsed&quot;, &quot;sixths&quot;). Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese, for example, broadly alternate consonant and vowel sounds so learners from Japan and Brazil often force vowels between the consonants (e.g. &quot;desks&quot; becomes or , and &quot;milk shake&quot; becomes or , respectively). Similarly, in most Iberian dialects, while a word can begin with , and within a word can be followed by a consonant, a word can never both begin with and be immediately followed by a consonant, so learners whose mother tongue is in this language family often have a vowel in front of the word (e.g. &quot;school&quot; becomes , , or for native speakers of Spanish, Brazilian and European Portuguese, and Catalan, respectively).

===Grammar===
International students typically exhibit a positive attitude toward learning English. This positive outlook persists across genders. Education in non-English-speaking countries usually focuses on grammar. English is introduced as a compulsory subject beginning in the first grades in these countries. However, despite the widespread implementation of English education, disparities exist in the quality of instruction across different types of schools. Consequently, these variations in educational quality have resulted in a gap in English proficiency among students from various regions.
* Tense, aspect, and mood – English has a relatively large number of tense–aspect–mood forms with some quite subtle differences, such as the difference between the simple past &quot;I ate&quot; and the present perfect &quot;I have eaten&quot;. Progressive and perfect progressive forms add complexity. (See English verbs.)
* Functions of auxiliaries – Learners of English tend to find it difficult to manipulate the various ways in which English uses auxiliary verbs. These include negation (e.g. &quot;He hasn&#x27;t been drinking.&quot;), inversion with the subject to form a question (e.g. &quot;Has he been drinking?&quot;), short answers (e.g. &quot;Yes, he has.&quot;) and tag questions (&quot;has he?&quot;). A further complication is that the dummy auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot;/&quot;does&quot;/&quot;did&quot; is added to fulfil these functions in the simple present and simple past, but not to replace the verb &quot;to be&quot; (&quot;He drinks too much.&quot;/&quot;Does he?&quot; but &quot;He is an addict&quot;/&quot;Is he?&quot;).
* Modal verbs – English has several modal auxiliary verbs, each with a number of uses. These verbs convey a special sense or mood such as obligation, necessity, ability, probability, permission, possibility, prohibition, or intention. These include &quot;must&quot;, &quot;can&quot;, &quot;have to&quot;, &quot;need to&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;ought to&quot;, &quot;will have to&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, and &quot;might&quot;.

:For example, the opposite of &quot;You must be here at 8&quot; (obligation) is usually &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be here at 8&quot; (lack of obligation, choice). &quot;Must&quot; in &quot;You must not drink the water&quot; (prohibition) has a different meaning from &quot;must&quot; in &quot;You must have eaten the chocolate&quot; (deduction). This complexity takes considerable work for most English language learners to master.

:All these modal verbs or &quot;modals&quot; take the first form of the verb after them. These modals (most of them) do not have past or future inflection, i.e. they do not have past or future tense (exceptions being &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;need to&quot;).

* Idiomatic usage – English is reputed to have a relatively high degree of idiomatic usage. For example, the use of different main verb forms in such apparently parallel constructions as &quot;try to learn&quot;, &quot;help learn&quot;, and &quot;avoid learning&quot; poses difficulty for learners. Another example is the idiomatic distinction between &quot;make&quot; and &quot;do&quot;: &quot;make a mistake&quot;, not &quot;do a mistake&quot;; and &quot;do a favor&quot;, not &quot;make a favor&quot;.
* Articles – English has two forms of article: &quot;the&quot; (the definite article) and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; (the indefinite article). In addition, at times English nouns can or indeed must be used without an article; this is called the zero article. Some of the differences between definite, indefinite, and zero articles are fairly easy to learn, but others are not, particularly since a learner&#x27;s native language may lack articles, have only one form, or use them differently from English. Although the information conveyed by articles is rarely essential for communication, English uses them frequently (several times in the average sentence) so that they require some effort from the learner.

===Vocabulary===
* Phrasal verbs – Phrasal verbs (also known as multiple-word verbs) in English can cause difficulties for many learners because of their syntactic pattern and because they often have several meanings. There are also a number of phrasal verb differences between American and British English.
* Prepositions – As with many other languages, the correct use of prepositions in the English language is difficult to learn, and it can turn out to be quite a frustrating learning experience for ESL/EFL learners. For example, the prepositions &quot;on&quot; (rely on, fall on), &quot;of&quot; (think of, because of, in the vicinity of), and &quot;at&quot; (turn at, meet at, start at) are used in so many different ways and contexts, it is very difficult to remember the exact meaning for each one. Furthermore, the same words are often used as adverbs (come in, press on, listen in, step in) as part of a compound verb (make up, give up, get up, give in, turn in, put on), or in more than one way with different functions and meanings (look up, look on, give in) (&quot;He looked up her skirt&quot;/&quot;He looked up the spelling&quot;/&quot;Things are looking up&quot;/&quot;When you&#x27;re in town, look me up!&quot;; &quot;He gave in his homework&quot;/&quot;First he refused but then he gave in&quot;; &quot;He got up at 6 o&#x27;clock&quot;/&quot;He got up the hill&quot;/&quot;He got up a nativity play&quot;). Also, for some languages, such as Spanish, there is/are one/some prepositions that can mean multiple English prepositions (i.e. &quot;en&quot; in Spanish can mean on, in, or at). When translating back to the ESL learners&#x27; respective L1, a particular preposition&#x27;s translation may be correct in one instance, but when using the preposition in another sense, the meaning is sometimes quite different. &quot;One of my friends&quot; translates to (transliterated) &quot;wahed min isdiqa&#x27;i&quot; in Arabic. &quot;Min&quot; is the Arabic word for &quot;from&quot;, so it means one &quot;from&quot; my friends. &quot;I am on page 5&quot; translates to &quot;ich bin auf Seite 5&quot; in German just fine, but in Arabic it is &quot;Ana fee safha raqm 5&quot; (I am &quot;in&quot; page 5).
* Word formation – Word formation in English requires much rote learning. For example, an adjective can be negated by using the prefixes &quot;un-&quot; (e.g. &quot;unable&quot;), &quot;in-&quot; (e.g. &quot;inappropriate&quot;), &quot;dis-&quot; (e.g. &quot;dishonest&quot;), &quot;non-&quot; (non-standard) or &quot;a-&quot; (e.g. &quot;amoral&quot;), as well as several rarer prefixes.
* Size of lexicon – The history of English has resulted in a very large vocabulary, including one stream from Old English and one from the Norman infusion of Latin-derived terms. (Schmitt &amp; Marsden claim that English has one of the largest vocabularies of any known language.) One estimate of the lexicon puts English at around 250,000 unique words. This requires more work for a learner to master the language.
* Collocations – Collocation in English is the tendency for words to occur together with others. For example, nouns and verbs that go together (&quot;ride a bike&quot; or &quot;drive a car&quot;). Native speakers tend to use chunks of collocations and ESL learners make mistakes with collocations.
* Slang and colloquialisms – In most native English-speaking countries, many slang and colloquial terms are used in everyday speech. Many learners may find that classroom based English is significantly different from how English is usually spoken in practice. This can often be difficult and confusing for learners with little experience of using English in Anglophone countries. Also, slang terms differ greatly between different regions and can change quickly in response to popular culture. Some phrases can become unintentionally rude if misused.
* Silent letters - Within English, almost every letter has the &#x27;opportunity&#x27; to be silent in a word, except &quot;F, J, Q, R, V&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot;. The most common is &quot;e&quot;, usually at the end of the word and used to elongate the previous vowel(s). The common usage of silent letters can throw off how ESL learners interpret the language (especially those who are fluent in a Germanic language), since a common step to learning words in most languages is to pronounce them phonetically. Words such as &quot;queue&quot;, &quot;Colonel&quot;, &quot;knight&quot; and &quot;Wednesday&quot; tend to throw off the learner, since they contain large amounts of silent letters.

===First-language literacy===
Learners who have had less than eight years of formal education in their first language are sometimes called &quot;adult ESL literacy learners&quot;. Usually, these learners have had their first-language education interrupted. Many of these learners require a different level of support, teaching approaches and strategies, and a different curriculum from mainstream adult ESL learners. For example, these learners may lack study skills and transferable language skills, and these learners may avoid reading or writing. Often these learners do not start classroom tasks immediately, do not ask for help, and often assume the novice role when working with peers. Generally, these learners may lack self-confidence. For some, prior schooling is equated with status, cultured, civilized, high class, and they may experience shame among peers in their new ESL classes.

===Second-language literacy===
Learners who have not had extensive exposure to reading and writing in a second language, despite having acceptable spoken proficiency, may have difficulties with the reading and writing in their L2. Joann Crandall (1993) has pointed out that most teacher training programs for TESOL instructors do not include sufficient, in most cases &quot;no&quot;, training for the instruction in literacy. This is a gap that many scholars feel needs to be addressed.

=== Importance of reading in ESL instruction ===
According to some English professionals, reading for pleasure is an important component in the teaching of both native and foreign languages:
===Differences between spoken and written English===

As with most languages, written language tends to use a more formal register than spoken language.

* &quot;Spelling and pronunciation&quot;: probably the biggest difficulty for non-native speakers, since the relation between English spelling and pronunciation does not follow the alphabetic principle consistently. Because of the many changes in pronunciation which have occurred since a written standard developed, the retention of many historical idiosyncrasies in spelling, and the large influx of foreign words (mainly from Norman French, Classical Latin and Greek) with different and overlapping spelling patterns, English spelling and pronunciation are difficult even for native speakers to master. This difficulty is shown in such activities as spelling bees. The generalizations that exist are quite complex and there are many exceptions, leading to a considerable amount of rote learning. The spelling and pronunciation system causes problems in both directions: a learner may know a word by sound but be unable to write it correctly (or indeed find it in a dictionary) or they may see a word written but not know how to pronounce it or mislearn the pronunciation. However, despite the variety of spelling patterns in English, there are dozens of rules that are 75% or more reliable.

There is also debate about &quot;meaning-focused&quot; learning and &quot;correction-focused&quot; learning. Supporters for the former think that using speech as the way to explain meaning is more important. However, supporters of the latter do not agree with that and instead think that grammar and correct habit is more important.

===Technology===

* Technology plays an integral part in our lives and has become a major instrument in the field of education. Educational technologies make learning and teaching of English language more convenient and enable new opportunities. The video talks about the history of technology in education and its current integration in learning. Computers have made an entry into education in the past decades and have brought significant benefits to teachers and students alike. Computers help learners by making them more responsible for their own learning. Studies have shown that one of the best ways of improving one&#x27;s learning ability is to use a computer where all the information one might need can be found. In today&#x27;s developed world, a computer is one of a number of systems that help learners to improve their language. Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is a system which aids learners to improve and practice language skills. It provides a stress-free environment for learners and makes them more responsible. Computers can provide help to ESL learners in many different ways such as teaching students to learn a new language. The computer can be used to test students about the language they already learn. It can assist them in practicing certain tasks. The computer permits students to communicate easily with other students in different places. In recent years the increasing use of mobile technology, such as smartphones and tablet computers, has led to a growing usage application created to facilitate language learning, such as The Phrasal Verbs Machine from Cambridge. In terms of online materials, there are many forms of online materials such as blogs, wikis, webquests. For instance, blogs can allow English learners to voice their opinions, sharpen their writing skills, and build their confidence. However, some who are introverted may not feel comfortable sharing their ideas on the blog. Class wikis can be used to promote collaborative learning through sharing and co-constructing knowledge. On-line materials are still just materials and thus need to be subject to the same scrutiny of evaluation as any other language material or source.
* Augmented reality (AR) is another emerging technology that has an important place in language education. It allows for merging of the virtual objects into the real world, as if they co-exist in the same time and place. The research has shown 8 benefits of AR in the educational setting: 1. Collaboration; 2. Connectivity; 3. Student centred; 4.Community; 5. Exploration; 6. Shared knowledge; 7. Multisensory experience; 8. Authenticity. Learners have mentioned that AR increased classroom engagement and student motivation. Two applications that have been tested in the ESL setting are QuiverVision and JigSpace.  QuiverVision offers colouring pages that can be brought to life using Android or iOS devices. JigSpace can be a helpful resource in learning complex scientific, technical and historical concepts for ESL students.
* Increasing social nature of internet opened up new opportunities for language learners and educators. Videos, memes and chats are all sources of authentic language that are easily accessible via mobile devices or computers. Additional benefit for English language learners is that non-textual representation can be more beneficial for students with various learning preferences.
* Integration of games and gaming in language learning has recently received a surge of interest. There are games that have been specifically designed for English language learning while there are others that can be adapted to this context. Games to Learn English includes multiple games that can be played to develop language skills. Trace Effects is a game developed by U.S. Department of State which helps learners not only increase their language knowledge but also explore American culture. The most important features of gaming are their collaborative and interactive nature which makes learning engaging for learners.
* The learning ability of language learners can be more reliable with the influence of a dictionary. Learners tend to carry or are required to have a dictionary which allows them to learn independently and become more responsible for their own work. In these modern days, education has upgraded its methods of teaching and learning with dictionaries where digital materials are being applied as tools. Electronic dictionaries are increasingly a more common choice for ESL students. Most of them contain native-language equivalents and explanations, as well as definitions and example sentences in English. They can speak the English word to the learner, and they are easy to carry around. However, they are expensive and easy to lose, so students are often instructed to put their names on them.

===Varieties of English===
* The English language in England (and other parts of the United Kingdom) exhibits significant differences by region and class, noticeable in structure (vocabulary and grammar), accent (pronunciation) and in dialect.
* The numerous communities of English native speakers in countries all over the world also have some noticeable differences like Irish English, Australian English, Canadian English, Newfoundland English, etc. For instance, the following are words that only make sense in their originating cultures: Toad in the hole, Gulab jamun, Spotted Dick, etc.
* Attempts have been made by John Dryden and others to regulate English to conform to a specific class or community. However, English as a lingua franca has no proscribing organization that controls any prestige dialect for the language – unlike the French &quot;Academie de la langue française&quot;, Spain&#x27;s &quot;Real Academia Española&quot;, or Esperanto&#x27;s &quot;Akademio&quot; – and so is not racialized.

Teaching English, therefore, involves not only helping the student to use the form of English most suitable for their purposes, but also exposure to regional forms and cultural styles so that the student will be able to discern meaning even when the words, grammar, or pronunciation are different from the form of English they are being taught to speak. Some professionals in the field have recommended incorporating information about non-standard forms of English in ESL programs. For example, in advocating for classroom-based instruction in African-American English (also known as Ebonics), linguist Richard McDorman has argued, &quot;Simply put, the ESL syllabus must break free of the longstanding intellectual imperiousness of the standard to embrace instruction that encompasses the many &quot;Englishes&quot; that learners will encounter and thereby achieve the culturally responsive pedagogy so often advocated by leaders in the field.&quot;

==Social challenges and benefits==

===Class placement===
ESL students often suffer from the effects of tracking and ability grouping. Students are often placed into low ability groups based on scores on standardized tests in English and math. There is also low mobility among these students from low to high performing groups, which can prevent them from achieving the same academic progress as native speakers. Similar tests are also used to place ESL students in college-level courses. Students have voiced frustration that only non-native students have to prove their language skills, when being a native speaker in no way guarantees college-level academic literacy. Studies have shown that these tests can cause different passing rates among linguistic groups regardless of high school preparation.

===Dropout rates===
Dropout rates for ESL students in multiple countries are much higher than dropout rates for native speakers. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States reported that the percentage of dropouts in the non-native born Hispanic youth population between the ages of 16 and 24 years old is 43.4%. A study in Canada found that the high school dropout rate for all ESL students was 74%. High dropout rates are thought to be due to difficulties ESL students have in keeping up in mainstream classes, the increasing number of ESL students who enter middle or high school with interrupted prior formal education, and accountability systems.

The accountability system in the US is due to the No Child Left Behind Act. Schools that risk losing funding, closing, or having their principals fired if test scores are not high enough begin to view students that do not perform well on standardized tests as liabilities. Because dropouts actually increase a school&#x27;s performance, critics claim that administrators let poor performing students slip through the cracks. A study of Texas schools operating under No Child Left Behind found that 80% of ESL students did not graduate from high school in five years.

===Access to higher education===
ESL students face several barriers to higher education. Most colleges and universities require four years of English in high school. In addition, most colleges and universities only accept one year of ESL English. It is difficult for ESL students that arrive in the United States relatively late to finish this requirement because they must spend a longer time in ESL English classes in high school, or they might not arrive early enough to complete four years of English in high school. This results in many ESL students not having the correct credits to apply for college, or enrolling in summer school to finish the required courses.

ESL students can also face additional financial barriers to higher education because of their language skills. Those that don&#x27;t place high enough on college placement exams often have to enroll in ESL courses at their universities. These courses can cost up to $1,000 extra, and can be offered without credit towards graduation. This adds additional financial stress on ESL students that often come from families of lower socioeconomic status. The latest statistics show that the median household income for school-age ESL students is $36,691 while that of non-ESL students is $60,280. College tuition has risen sharply in the last decade, while family income has fallen. In addition, while many ESL students receive a Pell Grant, the maximum grant for the year 2011–2012 covered only about a third of the cost of college.

===Interaction with native speakers===
ESL students often have difficulty interacting with native speakers in school. Some ESL students avoid interactions with native speakers because of their frustration or embarrassment at their poor English. Immigrant students often also lack knowledge of popular culture, which limits their conversations with native speakers to academic topics. In classroom group activities with native speakers, ESL students often do not participate, again because of embarrassment about their English, but also because of cultural differences: their native cultures may value silence and individual work at school in preference to social interaction and talking in class.

These interactions have been found to extend to teacher-student interactions as well. In most mainstream classrooms, a teacher-led discussion is the most common form of lesson. In this setting, some ESL students will fail to participate, and often have difficulty understanding teachers because they talk too fast, do not use visual aids, or use native colloquialisms. ESL students also have trouble getting involved with extracurricular activities with native speakers for similar reasons. Students fail to join extra-curricular activities because of the language barrier, the cultural emphasis of academics over other activities, or failure to understand traditional pastimes in their new country.

===Social benefits===
Supporters of ESL programs claim they play an important role in the formation of peer networks and adjustment to school and society in their new homes. Having class among other students learning English as a second language relieves the pressure of making mistakes when speaking in class or to peers. ESL programs also allow students to be among others who appreciate their native language and culture, the expression of which is often not supported or encouraged in mainstream settings. ESL programs also allow students to meet and form friendships with other non-native speakers from different cultures, promoting racial tolerance and multiculturalism.

=== Controversy over ethical administration of ESL programs ===
ESL programs have been critiqued for focusing more on revenue-generation than on educating students. This has led to controversy over how ESL programs can be managed in an ethical manner.

=== Professional and Technical Communication Advocacy ===
The field of technical and professional communication has the potential to disrupt barriers that hinder ESL learners from entering the field, although it can just as easily perpetuate these issues. One study by Matsuda &amp; Matsuda sought to evaluate introductory-level textbooks on the subject of technical communication. Among their research, they found that these textbooks perpetuated the &quot;myth of linguistic homogeneity—the tacit and widespread acceptance of the dominant image of composition students as native speakers of a privileged variety of English.&quot; While the textbooks were successful in referencing global and international perspectives, the portrayal of the intended audience, the you of the text, ultimately alienated any individual not belonging to a predominantly white background and culture. In constructing this guise, prospective ESL learners are collectively lumped into an &quot;other&quot; group that isolates and undermines their capacity to enter the field.

Furthermore, this alienation is exacerbated by the emergence of English as the pinnacle language for business and many professional realms. In Kwon &amp; Klassen&#x27;s research, they also identified and criticized a &quot;single native-speaker recipe for linguistic success,&quot; which contributed to anxieties about entering the professional field for ESL technical communicators. These concerns about an English-dominated professional field indicate an affective filter that provides a further barrier to social justice for these ESL individuals. These misconceptions and anxieties point towards an issue of exclusivity that technical and professional communicators must address. This social justice concern becomes an ethical concern as well, with all individuals deserving usable, accessible, and inclusive information.

There is a major concern about the lack of accessibility to translation services and the amount of time and attention their English proficiency is given throughout their educational experiences. If a student lacks an understanding of the English language and still needs to participate in their coursework, they will turn to translations in order to aid their efforts. The issue is that many of these translations rarely carry the same meaning as the original text. The students in this study said that a translated text is &quot;pretty outdated, covers only the basics or is terribly translated,&quot; and that &quot;The technical vocabulary linked to programming can be complicated to assimilate, especially in the middle of explanatory sentences if you don&#x27;t know the equivalent word in your native language.&quot; Students can&#x27;t be proficient in their given subjects if the language barrier is complicating the message. Researchers found that syntax, semantics, style, etc., scramble up the original messages. This disorientation of the text fogs up the message and makes it difficult for the student to decipher what they are supposed to be learning. This is where additional time and attention are needed to bridge the gap between native English speakers and ESL students. ESL students face difficulties in areas concerning lexico-grammatical aspects of technical writing., overall textual organization and comprehension, differentiation between genres of technical communication and the social hierarchies that concern the subject matter. This inhibits their ability to comprehend complex messages from English texts, and it would be more beneficial for them to tackle these subjects individually. The primary issue with this is the accessibility to more instruction. ESL students need an individual analysis of their needs and this needs to revolve around the student&#x27;s ability to communicate and interpret information in English. Due to the civil rights decision of Lauv v. Nichols school districts are required to provide this additional instruction based on the needs of students, but this requirement still needs to be acted on.

Many ESL students have issues in higher-level courses that hinder their academic performances due to the complicated language used in these courses being at a more complex level than what many ESL students were taught. In many cases of ESL students learning Computer Programming, they struggle with the language used in instructional manuals. Writing media centers have caused ESL students issues with universities unable to provide proofreading in their writing media center programs. This causes many ESL students to have difficulties writing papers for high-level courses that require a more complex lexicon than what many of them were taught. Fortunately, university tutors have had successes with teaching ESL students how to write a more technically complex language that ESL students need to know for their courses, but it raises the question of if ESL learners need to know a more complex version of the English language to succeed in their professional careers.

==Peer tutoring for ESL students==
Peer tutoring refers to an instructional method that pairs up low-achieving English readers, with ESL students that know minimal English and who are also approximately the same age and same grade level. The goal of this dynamic is to help both the tutor, in this case, the English speaker, and the tutee, the ESL student. Monolingual tutors are given the class material in order to provide tutoring to their assigned ESL tutee. Once the tutor has had the chance to help the student, classmates get to switch roles in order to give both peers an opportunity to learn from each other. In a study, which conducted a similar research, their results indicated that low-achieving readers that were chosen as tutors, made a lot of progress by using this procedure. In addition, ESL students were also able to improve their grades due to the fact that they increased their approach in reading acquisition skills.

===Importance===
Since there is not enough funding to afford tutors, and teachers find it hard to educate all students who have different learning abilities, it is highly important to implement peer-tutoring programs in schools. Students placed in ESL program learn together along with other non-English speakers; however, by using peer tutoring in a classroom it will avoid the separation between regular English classes and ESL classes. These programs will promote community between students that will be helping each other grow academically. To further support this statement, a study researched the effectiveness of peer tutoring and explicit teaching in classrooms. It was found that students with learning disabilities and low performing students who are exposed to the explicit teaching and peer tutoring treatment in the classroom, have better academic performance than those students who do not receive this type of assistance. It was proven that peer tutoring is the most effective and no cost form of teaching

===Benefits===
It has been proven that peer-mediated tutoring is an effective tool to help ESL students succeed academically. Peer tutoring has been utilized across many different academic courses and the outcomes for those students that have different learning abilities are outstanding. Classmates who were actively involved with other peers in tutoring had better academic standing than those students who were not part of the tutoring program. Based on their results, researchers found that all English student learners were able to maintain a high percentage of English academic words on weekly tests taught during a tutoring session. It was also found that the literature on the efficacy of peer tutoring service combined with regular classroom teaching, is the best methodology practice that is effective, that benefits students, teachers, and parents involved.

===Research on peer English immersion tutoring===
Similarly, a longitudinal study was conducted to examine the effects of the paired bilingual program and an English-only reading program with Spanish speaking English learners in order to increase students&#x27; English reading outcomes. Students whose primary language was Spanish and were part of the ESL program were participants of this study. Three different approaches were the focus in which immersing students in English from the very beginning and teaching them reading only in that language; teaching students in Spanish first, followed by English; and teaching students to read in Spanish and English simultaneously. This occurs through a strategic approach such as structured English immersion or sheltered instruction.

Findings showed that the paired bilingual reading approach appeared to work as well as, or better than, the English-only reading approach in terms of reading growth and results. Researchers found differences in results, but they also varied based on several outcomes depending on the student&#x27;s learning abilities and academic performance.

===ESL teachers&#x27; training===
Teachers in an ESL class are specifically trained in particular techniques and tools to help students learn English. Research says that the quality of their teaching methods is what matters the most when it comes to educating English learners. It was also mentioned how it is highly important for teachers to have the drive to help these students succeed and &quot;feel personal responsibility.&quot; It is important to highlight the idea that the school system needs to focus on school-wide interventions in order to make an impact and be able to help all English learners. There is a high need for comprehensive professional development for teachers in the ESL program.

===Effects of peer tutoring on the achievement gap===
Although peer tutoring has been proven to be an effective way of learning that engages and promotes academic achievement in students, does it have an effect on the achievement gap? It is an obvious fact that there is a large academic performance disparity between White, Black, and Latino students, and it continues to be an issue that has to be targeted. In an article, it was mentioned that no one has been able to identify the true factors that cause this discrepancy. However it was mentioned that by developing effective peer tutoring programs in schools could be a factor that can potentially decrease the achievement gap in the United States.

==Exams for learners==
Learners of English are often eager to get accreditation and a number of exams are known internationally:
* IELTS (International English Language Testing System) is the world&#x27;s most popular English test for higher education and immigration. It is managed by the British Council, Cambridge Assessment English and IDP Education. It is offered in Academic, General and Life Skills versions. IELTS Academic is the normal test of English proficiency for entry into universities in the UK, Australia, Canada, and other British English countries. IELTS General is required for immigration into Australia and New Zealand. Both versions of IELTS are accepted for all classes of UK visa and immigration applications. IELTS Life Skills, was introduced in 2015 specifically to meet the requirements for some classes of UK visa application.
* CaMLA, a collaboration between the University of Michigan and Cambridge English Language Assessment offer a suite of American English tests, including the MET (Michigan English Test), the MTELP Series (Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency), MELAB (Michigan English Language Assessment Battery), CaMLA EPT (English Placement Test), YLTE (Young Learners Test of English), ECCE and ECPE.
* TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), an Educational Testing Service product, developed and used primarily for academic institutions in the US, and now widely accepted in tertiary institutions in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the UK, Japan, South Korea, and Ireland. The current test is an Internet-based test and is thus known as the TOEFL iBT. Used as a proxy for English for Academic Purposes.
* iTEP (International Test of English Proficiency), developed by former ELS Language Centers President Perry Akins&#x27; Boston Educational Services, and used by colleges and universities such as the California State University system. iTEP Business is used by companies, organizations, and governments, and iTEP SLATE (Secondary Level Assessment Test of English) is designed for middle and high school-age students.
* PTE Academic (Pearson Test of English Academic), a Pearson product, measures reading, writing, speaking and listening as well as grammar, oral fluency, pronunciation, spelling, vocabulary and written discourse. The test is computer-based and is designed to reflect international English for academic admission into any university requiring English proficiency.
* TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication), an Educational Testing Service product for Business English used by 10,000 organizations in 120 countries. Includes a listening and reading test as well as a speaking and writing test introduced in selected countries beginning in 2006.
* Trinity College London ESOL offers the Integrated Skills in English (ISE) series of 5 exams which assesses reading, writing, speaking and listening and is accepted by academic institutions in the UK. They also offer Graded Examinations in Spoken English (GESE), a series of 12 exams, which assesses speaking and listening, and ESOL Skills for Life and ESOL for Work exams in the UK only.
* Cambridge Assessment English offers a suite of globally available examinations including General English: Key English Test (KET), Preliminary English Test (PET), First Certificate in English (FCE), Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) and Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE).
* London Tests of English from Pearson Language Tests, a series of six exams each mapped to a level from the Common European Framework (CEFR) – see below.
* Secondary Level English Proficiency test
* MTELP (Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency), is a language certificate measuring a student&#x27;s English ability as a second or foreign language. Its primary purpose is to assess a learner&#x27;s English language ability at an academic or advanced business level.

Many countries also have their own exams. ESOL learners in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland usually take the national Skills for Life qualifications, which are offered by several exam boards. EFL learners in China may take the College English Test, the Test for English Majors (TEM), and/or the Public English Test System (PETS). People in Taiwan often take the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT). In Greece, English students may take the PALSO (PanHellenic Association of Language School Owners) exams.

===The Common European Framework===

Between 1998 and 2000, the Council of Europe&#x27;s language policy division developed its Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. The aim of this framework was to have a common system for foreign language testing and certification, to cover all European languages and countries.

The Common European Framework (CEF) divides language learners into three levels:
* A. Basic User
* B. Independent User
* C. Proficient User

Each of these levels is divided into two sections, resulting in a total of six levels for testing (A1, A2, B1, etc.).

This table compares ELT exams according to the CEF levels:

==Qualifications for teachers==
Qualifications vary from one region or jurisdiction to the next. There are also different qualifications for those who manage or direct TESOL programs

===Non-native speakers===
Most people who teach English are in fact not native speakers. They are state school teachers in countries around the world, and as such, they hold the relevant teaching qualification of their country, usually with a specialization in teaching English. For example, teachers in Hong Kong hold the Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers. Those who work in private language schools may, from commercial pressures, have the same qualifications as native speakers (see below). Widespread problems exist of minimal qualifications and poor quality providers of training, and as the industry becomes more professional, it is trying to self-regulate to eliminate these.

===Australian qualifications===
The Australian Skills Quality Authority accredits vocational TESOL qualifications such as the 10695NAT Certificate IV in TESOL and the 10688NAT Diploma in TESOL. As ASQA is an Australian Government accreditation authority, these qualifications rank within the Australian Qualifications Framework. And most graduates work in vocational colleges in Australia. These TESOL qualifications are also accepted internationally and recognized in countries such as Japan, South Korea, and China.

===British qualifications===
Common, respected qualifications for teachers within the United Kingdom&#x27;s sphere of influence include certificates and diplomas issued by Trinity College London ESOL and Cambridge English Language Assessment (henceforth Trinity and Cambridge).

A certificate course is usually undertaken before starting to teach. This is sufficient for most EFL jobs and for some ESOL ones. CertTESOL (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), issued by Trinity, and CELTA (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults), issued by Cambridge, are the most widely taken and accepted qualifications for new teacher trainees. Courses are offered in the UK and in many countries around the world. It is usually taught full-time over a one-month period or part-time over a period of up to a year.

Teachers with two or more years of teaching experience who want to stay in the profession and advance their career prospects (including school management and teacher training) can take a diploma course. Trinity offers the Trinity Licentiate Diploma in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (DipTESOL) and Cambridge offers the Diploma in English Language Teaching to Adults (DELTA). These diplomas are considered to be equivalent and are both accredited at level 7 of the revised National Qualifications Framework. Some teachers who stay in the profession go on to do an MA in a relevant discipline such as applied linguistics or ELT. Many UK master&#x27;s degrees require considerable experience in the field before a candidate is accepted onto the course.

The above qualifications are well-respected within the UK EFL sector, including private language schools and higher education language provision. However, in England and Wales, in order to meet the government&#x27;s criteria for being a qualified teacher of ESOL in the Learning and Skills Sector (i.e. post-compulsory or further education), teachers need to have the Certificate in Further Education Teaching Stage 3 at level 5 (of the revised NQF) and the Certificate for ESOL Subject Specialists at level 4. Recognised qualifications which confer one or both of these include a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in ESOL, the CELTA module 2, and City &amp; Guilds 9488. Teachers of any subject within the British state sector are normally expected to hold a PGCE and may choose to specialise in ELT.

===Canadian qualifications===
Teachers teaching adult ESL in Canada in the federally funded Language Instruction to Newcomers (LINC) program must be TESL certified. Most employers in Ontario encourage certification by TESL Ontario. Often this requires completing an eight-month graduate certificate program at an accredited university or college. See the TESL Ontario or TESL Canada websites for more information.

===United States qualifications===
Some U.S. instructors at community colleges, private language schools and universities qualify to teach English to adult non-native speakers by completing a Master of Arts (MA) in TESOL. Other degrees may be a Master in Adult Education and Training or Applied Linguistics. This degree also qualifies them to teach in most EFL contexts. There are also a growing number of online programs offering TESOL degrees. In fact, &quot;the growth of Online Language Teacher Education (OLTE) programs from the mid-1990s to 2009 was from 20 to more than 120&quot;.

In many areas of the United States, a growing number of K–12 public school teachers are involved in teaching ELLs (English Language Learners, that is, children who come to school speaking a home language other than English). The qualifications for these classroom teachers vary from state to state but always include a state-issued teaching certificate for public instruction. This state licensing requires substantial practical experience as well as course work. In some states, an additional specialization in ESL/ELL is required. This may be called an &quot;endorsement&quot;. Endorsement programs may be part of a graduate program or maybe completed independently to add the endorsement to the initial teaching certificate

An MA in TESOL may or may not meet individual state requirements for K–12 public school teachers. It is important to determine if a graduate program is designed to prepare teachers for adult education or K–12 education.

The MA in TESOL typically includes second-language acquisition theory, linguistics, pedagogy, and an internship. A program will also likely have specific classes on skills such as reading, writing, pronunciation, and grammar. Admission requirements vary and may or may not require a background in education and/or language. Many graduate students also participate in teaching practica or clinicals, which provide the opportunity to gain experience in classrooms.

In addition to traditional classroom teaching methods, speech pathologists, linguists, actors, and voice professionals are actively involved in teaching pronunciation of American English—called accent improvement, accent modification, and accent reduction—and serve as resources for other aspects of spoken English, such as word choice.

It is important to note that the issuance of a teaching certificate or license for K–12 teachers is not automatic following completion of degree requirements. All teachers must complete a battery of exams (typically the Praxis test or a specific state test subject and method exams or similar, state-sponsored exams) as well as supervised instruction as student teachers. Often, ESL certification can be obtained through extra college coursework. ESL certifications are usually only valid when paired with an already existing teaching certificate. Certification requirements for ESL teachers vary greatly from state to state; out-of-state teaching certificates are recognized if the two states have a reciprocity agreement.

The following document states the qualifications for an ESL certificate in the state of Pennsylvania.

===Chile qualifications===
Native speakers will often be able to find work as an English teacher in Chile without an ESL teaching certificate. However, many private institutes give preference to teachers with a TEFL, CELTA, or TESOL certificate. The Chilean Ministry of Education also sponsors the English Opens Doors program, which recruits native English speakers to come work as teaching assistants in Chilean public schools. English Opens Doors requires only a bachelor&#x27;s degree in order to be considered for acceptance.

===United Arab Emirates qualifications===
Native speakers must possess teacher certification in their home country in order to teach English as a foreign language in most institutions and schools in United Arab Emirates (UAE). Otherwise, CELTA/TESOL/TEFL/ Certificate or the like is required along with prior teaching experience.

==Professional associations and unions==
* TESOL International Association (TESOL) is a professional organization based in the United States. In addition, TESOL International Association has more than 100 statewide and regional affiliates in the United States and around the world, see below.
* The International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL) is a professional organization based in the United Kingdom.

<text>Alexandra Doig is a Canadian actress. She played the title role in the science fiction television series &quot;Andromeda&quot; (2000–2005). She also played the lead female role of Rowan in the science fiction-action horror film &quot;Jason X&quot; (2001), the tenth installment of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film series. Since 2015, Doig has appeared in the Aurora Teagarden mystery television film series on the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries channel.

== Early life ==
Doig was born and grew up in Toronto, Ontario. Her father is of Scottish descent and her mother is of Filipino ancestry.

As a child, Doig studied rhythmic gymnastics, and as a teenager studied American Sign Language. She developed a strong interest in acting and was inspired to become an actor at age nine after she watched a theatre production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early modelling ===
While completing compulsory secondary education at Don Mills Collegiate Institute, she enrolled in a vocational modelling program. There, at age 16, she was immediately offered representation by a talent agent and booked in various modelling projects. She chose to drop out from her final year in high school to pursue an acting career.

The initial media exposure led to her co-hosting the Canadian game show &quot;Video &amp; Arcade Top 10&quot; (1991–2006). While auditioning for television and film roles, she worked on theatre productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;.

=== Acting ===

Her first television acting role was as &quot;Second Girl&quot; on &quot;The Hidden Room&quot; in 1993. Her first recurring role was in the TV series &quot;TekWar&quot; in 1994 where she portrayed the role of Cowgirl. Her first movie role was in &quot;Jungleground&quot; (1995). Doig got her first big break with a starring role in the movie &quot;No Alibi&quot; in 2000. She also landed the title role in Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s sci-fi TV series &quot;Andromeda&quot; where, from 2000 to 2005, she portrayed the Andromeda Ascendant ship&#x27;s computer in three personas — as the ship&#x27;s powerful AI (artificial intelligence) on the ship&#x27;s screen, as the AI&#x27;s hologram, and as Rommie, the android avatar of the AI.

In 2001, she played the female lead role of &quot;Dr. Rowan LaFontaine&quot; in the horror film &quot;Jason X&quot;, the tenth instalment of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film series. In a recurring role as Dr. Carolyn Lam, Doig appeared in 11 episodes of the ninth and tenth seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; between 2005–2007. In 2010, Doig appeared in six episodes in the remake of &quot;V&quot; as the alien physician Dr. Leah Pearlman.

<text>The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is the regional intergovernmental organization and geopolitical union of states in South Asia. Its member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. SAARC comprises 3% of the world&#x27;s land area, 21% of the world&#x27;s population and 5.21% (US$4.47 trillion) of the global economy, as of 2021.

SAARC was founded in Dhaka on 8 December 1985. Its secretariat is based in Kathmandu, Nepal. The organization promotes economic development and regional integration. It launched the South Asian Free Trade Area in 2006. SAARC maintains permanent diplomatic relations at the United Nations as an observer and has developed links with multilateral entities, including the European Union. However, due to the geopolitical conflict between India and Pakistan and the situation in Afghanistan, the organization has been suspended for a long time, and India currently cooperates with its eastern neighbors through BIMSTEC.

==Historical background==
The idea of co-operation among South Asian Countries was discussed in three conferences: the Asian Relations Conference held in New Delhi in April 1947; the Baguio Conference in the Philippines in May 1950; and the Colombo Powers Conference held in Sri Lanka in April 1954.
In the ending years of the 1970s, the seven inner South Asian nations that included Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, agreed upon the creation of a trade bloc and to provide a platform for the people of South Asia to work together in a spirit of friendship, trust, and understanding. President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh later wrote official letters to the leaders of the countries of South Asia, presenting his vision for the future of the region and compelling arguments for co-operation. During his visit to India in December 1977, Rahman discussed the issue of regional cooperation with the Indian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai. In the inaugural speech to the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee which met in Kathmandu also in 1977, King Birendra of Nepal gave a call for close regional cooperation among South Asian countries in sharing river waters.

After the USSR&#x27;s intervention in Afghanistan, efforts to establish the union were accelerated in 1979 amid the resulting rapid deterioration of the South Asian security situation. Responding to Rahman and Birendra&#x27;s convention, officials of the foreign ministries of the seven countries met for the first time in Colombo in April 1981. The Bangladeshi proposal was promptly endorsed by Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Maldives, however India and Pakistan were sceptical initially. The Indian concern was the proposal&#x27;s reference to the security matters in South Asia and feared that Rahman&#x27;s proposal for a regional organisation might provide an opportunity for new smaller neighbours to re-internationalize all bilateral issues and to join with each other to form an opposition against India. Pakistan assumed that it might be an Indian strategy to organize the other South Asian countries against Pakistan and ensure a regional market for Indian products, thereby consolidating and further strengthening India&#x27;s economic dominance in the region.

However, after a series of diplomatic consultations headed by Bangladesh between South Asian UN representatives at the UN headquarters in New York, from September 1979 to 1980, it was agreed that Bangladesh would prepare the draft of a working paper for discussion among the foreign secretaries of South Asian countries. The foreign secretaries of the inner seven countries again delegated a Committee of the Whole in Colombo in September 1981, which identified five broad areas for regional cooperation. New areas of co-operation were added in the following years.

In 1983, at the international conference held in Dhaka by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the foreign ministers of the inner seven countries adopted the Declaration on South Asian Association Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and formally launched the Integrated Programme of Action (IPA) initially in five agreed areas of cooperation, namely, Agriculture; Rural Development; Telecommunications; Meteorology; and Health and Population Activities.

Officially, the union was established in Dhaka with Kathmandu being the union&#x27;s secretariat-general. The first SAARC summit was held in Dhaka on 7–8 December 1985 and hosted by the President of Bangladesh Hussain Ershad. The declaration was signed by, namely, King of Bhutan Jigme Singye Wangchuk; President of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq; Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi; King of Nepal Birendra Shah; President of Sri Lanka JR Jayewardene; and President of Maldives Maumoon Gayoom.

==Members and observers==
Economic data is sourced from the International Monetary Fund, current as of November 2024 unless stated otherwise, and is given in US dollars.

===Members===


The member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

SAARC was founded by seven states in 1985. In 2005, Afghanistan began negotiating their accession to SAARC and formally applied for membership in the same year. The issue of Afghanistan joining SAARC generated a great deal of debate in each member state, including concerns about the definition of South Asian identity because Afghanistan is considered a Central Asian country, while it is neither accepted as a Middle Eastern country, nor as a Central Asian country, or as part of the Indian subcontinent, other than being only in part of South Asia.

SAARC member states imposed a stipulation for Afghanistan to hold a general election; the non-partisan elections were held in late 2005. Despite initial reluctance and internal debates, Afghanistan joined SAARC as its eighth member state in April 2007.

Despite the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2021, Afghanistan is still a member of SAARC, despite calls for their suspension and none of the other SAARC members recognizing the Taliban government. The issue was further exasperated as it was Afghanistan&#x27;s turn to select a Secretary General for SAARC in 2023. All other members decided to skip Afghanistan and award the selection to Bangladesh, with Nepali foreign secretary, Bharat Raj Paudyal, stating that &quot;When the term of the Bangladeshi secretary general ends, if the problems in Afghanistan are resolved, the new secretary general will be from Afghanistan, not from Bhutan.&quot;

===Observer countries===
States with observer status include Australia, China, the European Union, Iran, Japan, Mauritius, Myanmar, South Korea, and the United States.

China&#x27;s 2007 application for observer status received strong support from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Other South Asian members of SAARC agreed to support China&#x27;s observer status, but were not as strongly in favor.

On 2 August 2006, the foreign ministers of SAARC countries agreed in principle to grant observer status to three applicants; the US and South Korea (both made requests in April 2006), as well as the European Union (requested in July 2006). On 4 March 2007, Iran requested observer status, followed shortly by Mauritius.

===Potential future members===
Myanmar has expressed interest in upgrading its status from an observer to a full member of SAARC. China has requested joining SAARC. Russia has applied for observer status membership of SAARC. Turkey applied for observer status membership of SAARC in 2012. South Africa has participated in meetings. Indonesia, Jordan, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Yemen have expressed interest.

==Secretariat==
The SAARC Secretariat was established in Kathmandu on 16 January 1987 and was inaugurated by the late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah of Nepal.

===Specialized bodies===
SAARC member states have created the following specialized bodies of SAARC in the member states which have special mandates and structures different from the regional centers. These bodies are managed by their respective governing boards composed of representatives from all the member states, the representative of H.E. secretary-general of SAARC and the ministry of foreign/external affairs of the host government. The heads of these bodies act as member secretary to the governing board which reports to the programming committee of SAARC.

===Regional Centres===
The SAARC Secretariat is supported by following Regional Centres established in the Member States to promote regional co-operation. These Centres are managed by Governing Boards comprising representatives from all the Member States, SAARC Secretary-General and the Ministry of Foreign/External Affairs of the Host Government. The Director of the Centre acts as Member Secretary to the Governing Board which reports to the Programming Committee. After 31 December 2015, there 6 regional centers were stopped by unanimous decision. These are SMRC, SFC, SDC, SCZMC, SIC, SHRDC.

===Anthem===
SAARC does not have an official anthem as yet like some other regional organizations (e.g. ASEAN).

==Apex and Recognized Bodies==
SAARC has six Apex Bodies, they are:
* SAARC Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (SCCI),
* South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in Law (SAARCLAW),
* South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA),
* South Asia Foundation (SAF),
* South Asia Initiative to End Violence Against Children (SAIEVAC),
* Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature (FOSWAL)

SAARC also has about 18 recognized bodies.

==SAARC Disaster Management Centre==

The SAARC Disaster Management Centre (SDMC) is a regional organization established to enhance disaster risk management and response within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member states. Its primary objective is to provide policy advice, technical support, capacity building, and training for comprehensive disaster risk management in the region. 

SAARC SDMC

Key Functions:

* Policy Advice and Technical Support: SDMC offers guidance on disaster management policies and assists in developing systems to improve disaster resilience.
* Capacity Building and Training: The center conducts training programs and workshops to strengthen the disaster management capabilities of member states.
* Information Exchange: Facilitates the sharing of information and expertise among member countries to enhance collaborative disaster risk management efforts.

Initiatives:

* South Asian Disaster Knowledge Network: A platform for sharing disaster-related information and best practices across the region.
* South Asia Digital Vulnerability Atlas (SADVA): An initiative aimed at mapping and analyzing disaster vulnerabilities in South Asia.

==Political issues==
Lasting peace and prosperity in South Asia has been elusive because of the various ongoing conflicts in the region. Political dialogue is often conducted on the margins of SAARC meetings which have refrained from interfering in the internal matters of its member states. During the 12th and 13th SAARC summits, extreme emphasis was laid upon greater cooperation between SAARC members to fight terrorism.

The 19th SAARC summit scheduled to be held in Pakistan was called off as India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan decided to boycott it due to a terrorist attack on an army camp in Uri. It was the first time that four countries boycotted a SAARC summit, leading to its cancellation.

SAARC has generally been ineffective at achieving enhanced regionalism.

==South Asian Free Trade Area==

The SAFTA was envisaged primarily as the first step towards the transition to a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) leading subsequently towards a Customs Union, Common Market and the Economic Union. In 1995, Sixteenth session of the Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 18–19 December 1995) agreed on the need to strive for the realization of SAFTA and to this end, an Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG) was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for progressing to a free trade area. The Tenth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 29–31 July 1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to draft a comprehensive treaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking into consideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in mind the need to fix realistic and achievable targets.

The SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit held in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2006, and the Trade Liberalization Programme commenced from 1 July 2006. Under this agreement, SAARC members will bring their duties down to 20 percent by 2009. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA Ministerial Council (SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member States. In 2012 SAARC exports increased substantially to $354.6 billion from $206.7 billion in 2009. Imports too increased from $330 billion to $602 billion over the same period. But the intra-SAARC trade amounts to just a little over 1% of SAARC&#x27;s GDP. In contrast to SAARC, in ASEAN (which is actually smaller than SAARC in terms of the size of the economy) the intra-bloc trade stands at 10% of its GDP.

The SAFTA was envisaged to gradually move towards the South Asian Economic Union, but the current intra-regional trade and investment relation are not encouraging and it may be difficult to achieve this target. SAARC intra-regional trade stands at just five percent on the share of intra-regional trade in overall trade in South Asia. Similarly, foreign direct investment is also dismal. The intra-regional FDI flow stands at around four percent of the total foreign investment.

The Asian Development Bank has estimated that inter-regional trade in SAARC region possessed the potential of shooting up agricultural exports by $14 billion per year from existing level of $8 billion to $22 billion. The study by Asian Development Bank states that against the potential average SAARC intra-regional trade of $22 billion per year, the actual trade in South Asia has been only around $8 billion. The uncaptured potential for intra-regional trade is therefore $14 billion per year, i.e., 68%.

==SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme==
The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme was launched in 1992. The leaders at the Fourth Summit (Islamabad, 29–31 December 1988), realizing the importance of people-to-people contact among SAARC countries, decided that certain categories of dignitaries should be entitled to a Special Travel document. The document would exempt them from visas within the region. As directed by the Summit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of entitled categories.

Currently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include dignitaries, judges of higher courts, parliamentarians, senior officials, entrepreneurs, journalists, and athletes.

The Visa Stickers are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled categories of that particular country. The validity of the Visa Sticker is generally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the Immigration Authorities of SAARC Member States.

==Awards==
===SAARC Award===
The Twelfth (12th) Summit approved the SAARC Award to support individuals and organizations within the region. The main aims of the SAARC Award are:
* To encourage individuals and organizations based in South Asia to undertake programmes and activities that complement the efforts of SAARC.
* To encourage individuals and organizations in South Asia contributing to bettering the conditions of women and children.
* To honour outstanding contributions and achievements of individuals and organizations within the region in the fields of peace, development, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and regional cooperation.
* To honour any other contributions and achievement not covered above of individuals and organizations in the region.

The SAARC Award consists of a gold medal, a letter of citation, and cash prize of $25,000. Since the institution of the SAARC Award in 2004, it has been awarded only once and the Award was posthumously conferred upon the late President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh.

===SAARC Literary Award===
The SAARC Literary Award is an annual award conferred by the Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature (FOSWAL) since 2001 which is an apex SAARC body. Some of the prominent recipients of this award include Shamshur Rahman, Mahasweta Devi, Jayanta Mahapatra, Abhi Subedi, Mark Tully, Sitakant Mahapatra, Uday Prakash, Suman Pokhrel, and Abhay K.

Nepali poet, lyricist, and translator Suman Pokhrel is the only poet/writer to be awarded twice.

===SAARC Youth Award===
The SAARC Youth Award is awarded to outstanding individuals from the SAARC region. The award is notable because of the recognition it gives to the Award winner in the SAARC region. The award is based on specific themes which apply to each year. The award recognizes and promotes the commitment and talent of the youth who give back to the world at large through various initiatives such as Inventions, Protection of the Environment and Disaster relief. The recipients who receive this award are ones who have dedicated their lives to their individual causes to improve situations in their own countries as well as paving a path for the SAARC region to follow.
The Committee for the SAARC Youth Award selects the best candidate based on his/her merits and their decision is final.

<text>Attacus atlas, the Atlas moth, is a large saturniid moth endemic to the forests of Asia. The species was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

The Atlas moth is one of the largest lepidopterans, with a wingspan measuring up to and a wing surface area of about 160 cm2 (≈25 in2). It is only surpassed in wingspan by the white witch (&quot;Thysania agrippina&quot;) and &quot;Attacus caesar&quot;, and in wing surface area by the Hercules moth (&quot;Coscinocera hercules&quot;). As in most silk moths, females are noticeably larger and heavier than males, while males have broader antennae.

==Description==


===Eggs===
Atlas moths lay a number of spherical eggs, in diameter, on the undersides of the leaves of food plants.

===Larva===
After approximately two weeks, dusty-green caterpillars hatch and feed on their egg-shell, and then the foliage of citrus, cinnamon, guava, and evergreen trees. The caterpillars can grow to in length and in thickness. They have white, waxy, fleshy spines along their backs, which become more prominent at later instars. On the last abdominal segment beside the prolegs, there is a large green spot surrounded by an orange ring.

===Pupa===
After reaching a length of about , the caterpillars pupate. They spin a 7–8 cm long papery cocoon interwoven with desiccated leaves and attach it to a twig using a strand of silk. The adult moths emerge from the cocoon after approximately four weeks depending on environmental factors.
===Imago===

Adult Atlas moths are weak, unsteady fliers. To conserve energy, the moths rest during the day and fly at night. As they lack fully formed mouthparts, the adults cannot eat, subsisting entirely on fat reserves accumulated during the larval stage. As a result, they live for only a few days during which their sole objective is seeking out a mate. Adults may be found on wing throughout the year but are most abundant between November and January.

Females release pheromones through a gland on the end of the abdomen to attract a mate. Females stay near discarded cocoons, seeking out a perch where the air currents will best carry their pheromones. Males can detect and home in on these pheromones from several kilometers away using chemoreceptors located on their feathery antennae.

The body is small compared to the wings. The upper side of the wings is reddish brown with a pattern of black, white, pink, and purple lines. There are triangular, scale-less windows bordered in black on each of the four wings. The undersides of the wings are paler. The tips of both forewings have prominent extensions that resemble the head of a snake. The resemblance is exaggerated by movements of the wings when the moth is confronted by potential predators.The Atlas moth has a very short, vestigial proboscis, and they do not eat once they have emerged from the cocoon, relying on fat storage for energy. Every flight takes valuable energy and can take days off their already short lives, as it has a very short life span of only one to two weeks. They conserve energy by flying as little as possible. A female will wait for a male to come along and be fertilised, lay eggs and die.

==Habitat==

Their habitat is primarily dry tropical forests, secondary forests, and shrublands across South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia, including Borneo.

==Etymology==
Atlas moths are named after Atlas, the Titan of Greek mythology (due to their size). In Hong Kong, the Cantonese means &quot;snake&#x27;s head moth&quot;, referring to the prominent extension of the forewing that resembles the head of a snake.

==Relationship with humans==

In India, Atlas moths are cultivated for their silk in a non-commercial capacity. Unlike silk produced by the related domestic silkmoth (&quot;Bombyx mori&quot;), Atlas moth silk is secreted as broken strands and is therefore less desirable. This brown, wool-like silk, known as &quot;fagara&quot;, is thought to have greater durability. Atlas moth cocoons are sometimes used as small pocket change purses in Taiwan. There is ongoing research as to whether the silk of the Atlas moth can be used as a substitute for common silks. The quality of the heavier cocoons, less restrictive rearing conditions, and competent properties of the fibers, make the silk produced by the Atlas moth a potential alternative for common silks. A study concluded that the silk fibers of the atlas moth had about an 80% higher density of cells and growth compared to the silk fibers of the silk moth.

The Japanese subspecies &quot;A. a. ryukyuensis&quot;, native to Yonaguni in the Yaeyama Islands.

==Similar taxa==
The term &quot;Atlas moth&quot; is sometimes used mistakenly as a name for any species in the genus &quot;Attacus&quot;, of which there are over 20 named species and subspecies. &quot;Attacus taprobanis&quot; native to southern India and Sri Lanka is very similar in morphology to the much more widely distributed &quot;Attacus atlas&quot;. It was once considered a subspecies of &quot;A. atlas&quot;. A few New World species can be mistaken for Atlas moths, specifically members of the genus &quot;Rothschildia&quot;. Very similar in appearance to the Asian Atlas moth, &quot;Rothschildia aurota&quot; is one of the largest members of its genus and a Neotropical relative.

<doc id="415418" wikidata="Q2747486" url="?curid=415418" title="Causes of the French Revolution">
<text>There is significant disagreement among historians of the French Revolution as to its causes. Usually, they acknowledge the presence of several interlinked factors, but vary in the weight they attribute to each one. These factors include cultural changes, normally associated with the Enlightenment; social change and financial and economic difficulties; and the political actions of the involved parties. For centuries, French society was divided into three estates or orders. 
*The first estate, the highest class, consisted of the clergy.
*The second estate consisted of the nobility. 
*The third estate consisted of the commoners. It included businessmen, merchants, court officials, lawyers, peasants, landless labourers and servants. 
The first two estates together consisted of 2% of the population whereas third estate was the remaining 98%. All of the many types of taxes were paid by the third estate. The society was based on the old French maxim &quot;The nobles fight; the clergy pray and the people pay&quot;. 

Beyond these relatively established facts about the social conditions surrounding the French Revolution, there is significant dissent among historians. Marxist historians, such as Lefebvre and Soboul, see the social tensions described here as the main cause of the revolution, as the Estates-General allowed them to manifest into tangible political action; the bourgeoisie and the lower classes were grouped into the third estate, allowing them to jointly oppose the establishment. Others see these social issues as important, but less so than the Enlightenment or the financial crisis; François Furet is a prominent proponent of the former, Simon Schama of the latter.

==Political background==

Prior to the revolution, France was a &quot;de jure&quot; absolute monarchy, a system that became known as the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. In practice, the power of the monarchy was typically checked by the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church, institutions such as the judicial &quot;parlements&quot;, national and local customs and, above all, the threat of insurrection. Prior to 1789, the last severe threat to the monarchy was the Fronde civil wars from 1648 to 1653 during the minority of Louis XIV. Although the earlier reign of Louis XIII had already seen a move towards centralization of the country, the adulthood of Louis XIV marked the peak of the French monarchy&#x27;s power. His tactics for bringing the nobility under control included inviting them to stay at his extravagant Palace of Versailles and participate in elaborate court rituals with a detailed code of etiquette.

Some scholars have argued that Louis XIV contributed to the monarchy&#x27;s downfall by failing to reform the government&#x27;s institutions while the monarchy was still secure. Others, including François Bluche, argue that Louis XIV cannot be held responsible for problems that would emerge over 70 years after his death.

His successor Louis XV was less interested in governing and his reign saw a decline in the power of the monarchy. Historians generally describe his reign as a period of stagnation, foreign policy setbacks, and growing popular discontent against the monarchy. His affairs with a succession of mistresses also damaged its reputation.
During the reign of Louis XVI, the power and prestige of the monarchy had declined to the point where the king struggled to overcome aristocratic resistance to fiscal reform, with the &quot;parlements&quot; often being focal points for this resistance. The &quot;parlements&quot; were regional courts of appeal that had the &quot;de facto&quot; power to block the implementation of legislation in their respective provinces. They were each dominated by the regional nobility. The power of the &quot;parlements&quot; had been curtailed by Louis XIV, but mostly reinstated during the minority of Louis XV. In 1770, Louis XV and René de Maupeou again curtailed the power of the &quot;parlements&quot;, except for the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris, the one that was the most powerful. Louis XVI reinstated them early in his reign. Alfred Cobban describes the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris as &quot;though no more in fact than a small, selfish, proud and venal oligarchy, [it] regarded itself, and was regarded by public opinion, as the guardian of the constitutional liberties of France.&quot;

Having already obstructed tax reform proposals during the reign of Louis XV, the &quot;parlements&quot; would play a major role in obstructing Louis XVI&#x27;s attempts to resolve the debt crisis. Traditionally, a king could quell a recalcitrant &quot;parlement&quot; by conducting a &quot;lit de justice&quot; ceremony, in which he would appear there in person to demand that they register an edict. However, by 1787, Louis XVI could not get this tactic to work. The &quot;parlements&quot; enjoyed wider support from the commoners, who appreciated their role as a check on royal power. This placed Louis XVI at a disadvantage when he attempted to coerce and then suppress them in 1787–88.

Encyclopædia Britannica cites Prussia as an example of a European state where a strong monarchy succeeded in preventing revolution and preserving its power through reforms from above. Conversely, the lack of a constitutional monarchy meant that the French monarch was a target for any popular discontent against the government. Traditionally, this was tempered because there was an aversion to direct criticism and disrespect towards the king (&quot;lèse-majesté&quot;), but by the start of Louis XVI&#x27;s reign, respect for the monarchy had declined. In his study of the &quot;libelle&quot; pamphlets and books, Robert Darnton noted that &quot;libelles&quot; during the reign of Louis XIV tended to direct their criticism towards individual figures like Cardinal Mazarin and even those that criticized the king&#x27;s actions directly still had a respectful tone. During the reign of Louis XV, &quot;libelles&quot; became willing to bluntly criticize both the king and the entire system of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;.

==Social background==

Throughout the early modern period a class of wealthy middlemen who connected producers emerged: the bourgeoisie. These bourgeoisie played a fundamental role in the French economy, accounting for 39.1% of national income despite only accounting for 7.7% of the population. Under the Ancien Régime they were part of the Third Estate, as they were neither clergymen (the First Estate) nor nobles (the Second Estate). Given their powerful economic position, and their aspirations on a class-wide level, the bourgeois wanted to ascend through the social hierarchy, formalised in the Estate system. This is reflected by cahiers submitted by members of the Third Estate in March to April 1789: those of Carcassonne demanded that Louis &quot;&quot;assure to the third estate the influence to which it is entitled in view of...its contribution to the public treasury&quot;. This desire for higher social position resulted in high levels of bourgeois entry into the Second Estate throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This was enabled by several factors. The poverty of many noble families meant that they married bourgeois families; the nobles gained bourgeois wealth, while the bourgeoisie gained noble status. Moreover, corruption was rife, with many bourgeoisie simply attaching the noble particle &#x27;de&#x27; to their name or assuming nonexistent titles. Investigations into this behaviour were stopped in 1727. Furthermore, many governmental offices and positions were sold to raise cash. The bourgeoisie bought these positions and hence were ennobled; by 1765, six thousand families had gained nobility through this method. Such entryism resulted in significant social tension as the nobles were angered that these bourgeoisie were entering their ranks (despite often having been bourgeois themselves one or two generations previously) while the bourgeoisie were angered that the nobles were trying to prevent them ascending and being disdainful when they did ascend. As such, there was significant social tension between the dominant classes at the time of the French Revolution.

==Cultural change== 

There are two main points of view with regard to cultural change as a cause of the French Revolution: the direct influence of Enlightenment ideas on French citizens, meaning that they valued the ideas of liberty and equality discussed by Rousseau and Voltaire &quot;et al&quot;, or the indirect influence of the Enlightenment insofar as it created a &quot;philosophical society&quot;&quot;. The Enlightenment ideas were particularly popularised by the influence of the American War of Independence on the soldiers who returned, and of Benjamin Franklin himself, who was a highly dynamic and engaging figure in the French court when he visited. The French publication of Locke&#x27;s &quot;Treatises&quot; in 1724 also played an important role in influencing both pre-Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary ideology. He has been considered an ideological &quot;father&quot; of the revolution.

When the First and Second Estates, as well as the King, failed to respond to the Third Estate&#x27;s demands, they eschewed the authority of the King, resulting in the Tennis Court Oath and the subsequent development of the Revolution. Furet, the foremost proponent of the &#x27;philosophical society&#x27; nuance to this view, says that the ideas of the Enlightenment were discussed in clubs and meetings &quot;where rank and birth were second to ... abstract argument&quot;. This resulted in a breakdown of the stratification that still divided the bourgeois and the nobles, fundamentally changing France&#x27;s social organisation. As such, when the Estates-General was called, its rigid organisation into Third Estate and Second Estate conflicted with the new, informal organisation, and caused dissent; the Third Estate had attained equal status to the nobility, in their view, and when they demanded that the Estates meet as equals, the King&#x27;s refusal triggered their secession from royal authority. Furet and others argue that the direct influence of Enlightenment ideas only played a part &quot;after&quot; the Revolution had begun, insofar as it was used to justify revolutionary action and fill the lack of central, guiding ideology that disillusionment with the monarchy had created.
==Financial crisis==
The financial crisis of the French crown played a role in creating the social background to the Revolution, generating widespread anger at the court, and (arguably most importantly) forcing Louis XVI to call the Estates-General. The court was deeply in debt, which in conjunction with a poor financial system, created a crisis. In order to service the debt, given the Crown could find no more willing lenders, Louis attempted to call upon the nobility via an Assembly of Notables. However, the nobility refused to help—their power and influence had been steadily reduced since the reign of Louis XIV—and hence Louis was forced to rely upon the Estates-General. This meant that the discontented Third Estate (damaged by poor policy and low standards of living) were given the opportunity to air their grievances, and when they did not receive the desired response, the Revolution proper began; they denied the authority of the King and set up their own government.

=== Harvest failures ===
Agriculture accounted for around 75% of all domestic production, dominating the French economy. With outdated production methods, farming remained labour-intensive and increasingly susceptible to crop diseases. The increasing fluctuation of harvest production in the late 1760s had further plunged villages into uncertainty. The lack of diversification of jobs and distinction between agricultural and industrial workers foreshadowed the catastrophic impact that harvest failures would equally have in big cities, with even jobs like construction being largely dependent on migrant workers who brought their earnings back to small villages. 

Harvest failures further touched the biggest industry in metropolitan France, textiles, with demand fluctuating according to harvest yield. The textile industry played a crucial role in transforming cities; Amiens and Abbeville known for woolens, Rouen for cotton, amongst others. However, Lyons proved to be the only town where production was concentrated, with most production carried out in farms and villages. This presented a growing issue with most industrial workers beings peasants, as well as their consumers, leaving textile susceptible to the catastrophic impacts of harvest failures. Indeed, with harvest uncertainty in 1770, the silk industry went into crisis and demand for linen became increasingly unstable.

===Causes of debt===
The French Crown&#x27;s debt was caused by both individual decisions, such as intervention in the American War of Independence and the Seven Years&#x27; War, and underlying issues such as an inadequate taxation system. The War of Independence alone cost 1.3 billion livres, more than double the Crown&#x27;s annual revenue, and in a single year—1781—227 million livres were spent on the campaign. The Seven Years&#x27; War was even more costly, at 1.8 billion livres, and the war preceding that, the War of the Austrian Succession, cost another billion livres. France faced an impossible dilemma: how to both maintain its international position and status by engaging in these conflicts, and fund them with an archaic and grossly inefficient system. 

The financial system was ineffective in multiple ways. First, despite the Bourbons&#x27; attempts to limit their power, the nobility still wielded significant influence at court; when Silhouette, a Controller-General, suggested taxing luxury items, he was removed from office due to noble opposition. Second, there was a system of tax immunities and feudal privileges that allowed many of France&#x27;s wealthy citizens to avoid many taxes, notwithstanding the fact that few direct taxes were levied in the first place. The &quot;vingtième&quot; (&quot;twentieth&quot;), a tax of 5% successfully imposed on the nobility, was indeed paid, but this additional revenue was nowhere near enough to allow the Crown to maintain the levels of spending it needed or wanted. The capitation (&quot;head tax&quot;) was also imposed, a tax that varied with social status and the number of people in the family, but this too was insufficient. The tax that &quot;was&quot; collected, a significant sum, was fixed at certain levels by the government through a system of tax farming; private individuals and groups were asked to collect a fixed amount of tax on behalf of the government, and could keep any excess. When the government failed to accurately forecast the levels of tax that they could collect, they did not benefit from any increase in national output. Furthermore, due to the obvious financial difficulties of the French Crown and the lack of a central bank, lenders demanded higher interest rates to compensate them for the higher risk; France faced interest rates twice as high as Britain did, which further increased the cost of servicing the debt and hence worsened the Crown&#x27;s problems.

===Impact of financial ministers===
One of the ministers that Louis turned to in order to resolve the financial crisis was Turgot, financial minister from 1774 to 1776. Turgot abolished the regulations surrounding the food supply, which to this point had been strictly controlled by the royal police: they monitored the purity of bread flour, prevented price manipulation via hoarding, and controlled the inflows and outflows of grain to regions facing good and bad harvests. This caused rampant speculation and a breakdown of interregional import-export dynamics; famine and dissent (the Flour War) ensued. Turgot was forced to restore regulation and repress the riots. Though resolved, the failed experiment led to deep distrust of the monarchy, with rumours of their intention to starve the poor both prevalent and widely believed.

In 1783, Calonne was appointed as Financial minister; Calonne, ahead of his time, advocated increasing public spending to drive up consumption and hence increase the country&#x27;s GDP and tax revenues. However, this policy also failed, and only resulted in higher debt and France facing a primary deficit for the first time. The total fiscal deficit reached 140 million in 1787.

Necker, appointed in 1777–1781 and 1788–1789, used his connections with European banks to facilitate lending in order to fund wars and service the debt, but this proved a temporary measure (as might be expected) and had little long term value.

==Living standards==
Furthermore, significant resentment was felt by the poorer members of the Third Estate (industrial and rural labourers), largely due to vast increases in the cost of living. From 1741 to 1785, there was a 62% increase in real cost of living. In 1788 and 1789, there were poor harvests, perhaps triggered by the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland. This caused bread prices to rise in conjunction with falling wages. In 1789 itself there was a 25% fall in real wages and an 88% increase in the price of bread.

These immediate issues increased the resentment of the underlying problem of the inequality of land distribution, in which peasants made up approximately 80% of the French population, but only owned 35% of the land. They had to pay various dues to their noble landlords, taxes which were often disproportionately high in comparison to their income. However, whereas rural peasants could at least sustain themselves with their farms, the poor harvests had a much worse impact on Paris, which played a major role in the rise of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;.

It was founded in February 1977 by the merger of the Vietnam Fatherland Front of North Vietnam and two Viet Cong formal groups, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Alliance of National, Democratic, and Peace Forces, and is considered as the modern incarnation of the League for the Independence of Vietnam (Viet Minh). It is an amalgamation of many smaller groups, including the Communist Party itself. Other groups that participated in the establishment of the Front were the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour, the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union ( the Ho Chi Minh Youth) and the Ho Chi Minh Young Pioneer Organization. It also included the Democratic Party of Vietnam and Socialist Party of Vietnam, until they disbanded in 1988.

The Front is described by the Vietnamese government as &quot;the political base of people&#x27;s power.&quot; It is intended to have a significant role in society, promoting &quot;national solidarity&quot; and &quot;unity of mind in political and spiritual matters.&quot;

Many of the government&#x27;s social programs are conducted through the Front. Recently, it has been given a role in programs to reduce poverty. The Front is also responsible for much of the government&#x27;s policy on religion: &quot;1. Everyone has freedom of beliefs and religions, he or she has the right to follow a religion or not to follow any religion. All religions are equal before the law. 2. The state respects and protects freedom of beliefs and religions. 3. No one should violate freedom of beliefs and religions or take advantage of beliefs and religions to infringe the law.&quot;

Perhaps more importantly, the Front is intended to supervise the activity of the government and of government organisations. Because the Front&#x27;s power base is mass participation and popular mobilisation, it is seen as representative of the people, and both Vietnam&#x27;s constitution and laws give it a special role.

<doc id="415422" wikidata="Q335038" url="?curid=415422" title="Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington">
<text>Peter Alexander Rupert Carington, 6th Baron Carrington, Baron Carington of Upton (6 June 1919 – 9July 2018), was a British Conservative Party politician and hereditary peer who served as Defence Secretary from 1970 to 1974, Foreign Secretary from 1979 to 1982, chairman of the General Electric Company from 1983 to 1984, and Secretary General of NATO from 1984 to 1988. In Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first government, he played a major role in negotiating the Lancaster House Agreement that ended the conflict in Rhodesia and enabled the creation of Zimbabwe. Carrington later served as the Chairman of the Steering Committee for the Bilderberg Group&#x27;s meetings from 1990 to 1998.

Carington was Foreign Secretary in 1982 when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. He took full responsibility for the failure to foresee this and resigned. As NATO secretary general, he helped prevent a war between Greece and Turkey during the 1987 Aegean crisis.

Following the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Carington was created a life peer as Baron Carington of Upton.

==Background and early life==
The surname &quot;Carrington&quot; (with two Rs) was adopted by royal licence dated 1839 by his direct male ancestor Robert Carrington, 2nd Baron Carrington, in lieu of Smith. The latter&#x27;s father, Robert Smith, MP for Nottingham, was created Baron Carrington in 1796 (Peerage of Ireland) and 1797 (Peerage of Great Britain). The spelling of the surname was changed by royal licence to &quot;Carington&quot; (with one r) in 1880 by the 2nd Baron&#x27;s sons, but the spelling of the title did not change.

Born in Chelsea on 6 June 1919, Peter Alexander Rupert Carington was the only son of the 5th Baron Carrington by his wife, the Hon. Sybil Marion Colville, a daughter of Charles Colville, 2nd Viscount Colville of Culross. His great-uncles were the Liberal statesman Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire, and politician and courtier the Hon. Sir William Carington. Carington grew up in Millaton House, in Bridestowe, Devon. He went to Sandroyd School from 1928 to 1932, based at that time in Cobham, Surrey, and Eton College. On leaving Eton, his housemaster, Cyril Butterwick, said of Carington, &quot;For a really stupid boy, there are three possible professions: farming, soldiering and stockbroking&quot;.

==Military service==
After training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Carington was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards as a second lieutenant on 26 January 1939. He served with the regiment during the Second World War, was promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1941, and later temporary captain and acting major. Carington was a tank commander during Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands in 1944. He led the first group of four Sherman tanks to cross the Nijmegen road bridge across the Waal River and was awarded the Military Cross (MC) on 1 March 1945 &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North West Europe&quot;. After the war, Carington remained in the army until 1949.

==Political career 1946–1982==
In 1938, Carington succeeded his father as 6th Baron Carrington. Although he became eligible to take his seat in the House of Lords on his 21st birthday in 1940, since he was on active service, he did not do so until 9 October 1945. After leaving the Army, Carington became involved in politics, and served in the Conservative governments of Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden as Parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Food from November 1951 to October 1954. He was also appointed deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire on 2 July 1951. During the Crichel Down affair, which led to the resignation of minister Thomas Dugdale, Carington tendered his resignation, which was refused by the Prime Minister. Carington was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence from October 1954 to October 1956, and was then appointed High Commissioner to Australia, a post he held until October 1959. He became a Privy Counsellor in 1959.

Following his return to Britain he served under Harold Macmillan as First Lord of the Admiralty until October 1963. In this role, Carington worked with Lord Mountbatten, who was Chief of the Defence Staff, during a time of major restructuring and reform of the Admiralty. After Alec Douglas-Home became prime minister in October 1963, Carington held the posts of minister without portfolio and Leader of the House of Lords until October 1964, when the general election led to a change of government. From 1964 to 1970 he was Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.

When the Conservatives returned to power in 1970 under Edward Heath, Carington became Defence Secretary, where he remained until the February 1974 general election. In a 1977 letter discussing the policy of torture of Irish republican internees during Operation Demetrius in August 1971, the then Home Secretary Merlyn Rees attributed the origins of the policy to Carington: &#x27;&quot;It is my view (confirmed by Brian Faulkner before his death [NI&#x27;s prime minister at the time]) that the decision to use methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971/72 was taken by ministers – in particular Lord Carrington, then secretary of state for defence.&quot;

Carington became shadow defence secretary in 1968 after Enoch Powell was dismissed, following his controversial Rivers of Blood speech on immigration. He also served as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1972 to 1974, and was briefly Secretary of State for Energy from January to March 1974.
Carington was again leader of the opposition in the House of Lords from 1974 to 1979. In 1979 he was made Foreign Secretary and Minister for Overseas Development in the first cabinet of Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher spoke highly of Carington, stating that &quot;Peter had great panache and the ability to identify immediately the main points in any argument; and he could express himself in pungent terms. We had disagreements, but there were never any hard feelings.&quot;

Carington chaired the Lancaster House conference in 1979, attended by Ian Smith, Abel Muzorewa, Robert Mugabe, Joshua Nkomo and Josiah Tongogara, which brought to an end Rhodesia&#x27;s Bush War. He later expressed his support for Mugabe over Smith.

Carington was primarily responsible for ensuring the 1982 Canada Act passed the House of Lords. Under the provisions of the act, which received Royal Assent on 29 March 1982, the British Parliament renounced any future role in amending the Canadian constitution, a process known in the former dominion as patriation.

Carington was foreign secretary when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982. He resigned his position on 5 April, taking full responsibility for the complacency of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in its failure to foresee this development and for the misleading signals sent by the Foreign Office on British intentions for retaining control over the Falklands. In her autobiography, Margaret Thatcher later expressed her sorrow at his departure. She had asked him to stay but he left because he and the Foreign Office were distrusted and even hated by many back-bench Conservatives.

Lord Carrington was the most recent hereditary peer to hold one of the four Great Offices of State.

==Later life and death==

Carington served as Secretary General of NATO from 1984 to 1988. He was chairman of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1983 to 1988. He was appointed Chancellor of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 August 1984, serving until June 1994.

In 1991, he presided over diplomatic talks about the breakup of Yugoslavia and attempted to pass a plan to end the wars and result in each republic becoming an independent nation.

Aside from his political posts, Carington was chancellor of the University of Reading and served as chairman of several companies, including Christie&#x27;s, and as a director of many others, including Barclays Bank, Cadbury Schweppes and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He also chaired the Bilderberg conferences from 1990 to 1998, being succeeded in 1999 by Étienne Davignon. From 1983 to 2002, he was president of the Pilgrims Society, and from 1971 to 2018 president of the Britain–Australia Society. He was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter on 8 November 1994, a role from which he retired in October 2012.

After the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Carington, along with all former leaders of the House of Lords, was given a life peerage on 17 November 1999. He took this as Baron Carington of Upton, of Upton in the County of Nottinghamshire. He was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, and following the retirement of Lord Barber of Tewkesbury in 2016, had been the oldest. He was the second longest-serving member of the Privy Council after the Duke of Edinburgh.

Carington died from pneumonia on 9 July 2018, aged 99, at his home, the Manor House, in Bledlow, Buckinghamshire. His son Rupert succeeded him as Baron Carrington.

A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 31 January 2019.

==Family==
Carington married Iona McClean (19 March 1920 – 7 June 2009), daughter of Lt Col. Sir Francis McClean and Aileen Wale, on 25 April 1942. They had three children: Alexandra de Bunsen (born 1943), Virginia Carington (born 1946; formerly married to Lord Ashcombe), and Rupert Carington, 7th Baron Carrington (born 1948). Carington&#x27;s wife, Lady Carrington, died on 7 June 2009, aged 89.

==In popular culture==
Carington was a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1975 and on the same station&#x27;s &quot;A Good Read&quot; in 2004.

In the 1977 war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, John Stride played a Grenadier Guards captain at Nijmegen Bridge based on Carington. This portrayal depicted the historical argument between Carington and Major Julian Cook on whether to move forward along the &quot;Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot; route.

In February 1982 Carington was portrayed by Rowan Atkinson in a &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; parody of &quot;Question Time&quot;, pedantically discussing an imminent nuclear holocaust.

Carington was portrayed by James Fox in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis&#x27;s &quot;The Falklands Play&quot;.
He was also briefly portrayed by James Smith in the 2011 film &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, and by Jeff Rawle in the 2014 play &quot;Handbagged&quot;.

<text>Clarence Melvin Zener (December 1, 1905 – July 2, 1993) was the American physicist who in 1934 was the first to describe the property concerning the breakdown of electrical insulators. These findings were later exploited by Bell Labs in the development of the Zener diode, which was duly named after him. Zener was a theoretical physicist with a background in mathematics who conducted research in a wide range of subjects including: superconductivity, metallurgy, ferromagnetism, elasticity, fracture mechanics, diffusion, and geometric programming.

== Life ==

Zener was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of German-descent Clarence and Ida Zener, and brother of Katharine Zener (later Mrs Katharine Hurmiston) and psychologist Karl Zener, and earned his PhD in physics under Edwin Kemble at Harvard in 1929. His thesis was titled &quot;Quantum Mechanics of the Formation of Certain Types of Diatomic Molecules&quot;. In 1957 he received the Bingham Medal for his work in rheology, in 1959 the John Price Wetherill Medal from The Franklin Institute, in 1965 the Albert Souveur Achievement Award, in 1974 the Gold Medal from American Society for Metals, in 1982 the Von Hippel Award from the Materials Research Society, and in 1985 received the ICIFUAS (International Conference on Internal Friction and Ultrasonic Attenuation in Solids) Prize for the discovery of the Zener effect, pioneering studies of anelasticity in metals and prediction and observation of thermoelastic damping. ICIFUAS Prize was later renamed after Zener, following his death in 1993. A notable doctoral student of Zener&#x27;s was John B. Goodenough, Nobel Prize winner in chemistry in 2019, and Arthur S. Nowick held a postdoctoral appointment under Zener.

Zener was a research fellow at the University of Bristol from 1932 to 1934. He taught at Washington University in St. Louis (1935–1937), the City College of New York (1937–1940), and Washington State University (1940–1942) before working at the Watertown Arsenal during World War II. After the war, he taught at University of Chicago (1945–1951) where he was professor of physics, before being appointed as director of science at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Westinghouse (1951–1965). Here he developed his system of Geometric programming, which he used to solve engineering problems using adjustable parameters, defined by mathematical functions. Using this, Zener modeled designs for heat exchangers, to perform ocean thermal energy conversion, and discovered the most suitable areas for their deployment; many of these models are still being used today. Following his career at Westinghouse, Zener returned to teaching, leaving Pittsburgh briefly to become a professor at Texas A&amp;M University (1966–1968) but returned to finish his career at Carnegie Mellon University (1968–1993).

== Personality ==

Zener was known both for his dislike of experimental work and for preferring to work on practical problems within the arena of applied physics. Although he had a reputation of being very successful in these endeavors, he apparently considered himself as being less qualified to work on purely theoretical physics problems. In recognition of this, he once commented, after having dined with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer: &quot;when it came to fundamental physics, it was clear there was no point in competing with a person like that.&quot;

<text>Ross and Cromarty (), is an area in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In modern usage, it is a registration county and a lieutenancy area. Between 1889 and 1975 it was a county.

Historically, Ross-shire and Cromartyshire were separate counties, with Cromartyshire comprising a number of disconnected tracts of land scattered across Ross-shire. The two counties shared a sheriff from 1748, and were both included in the Ross and Cromarty constituency from 1832. They were formally united into a single county called Ross and Cromarty in 1889.

The mainland part of the county had a coast to the east onto the Moray Firth, and a coast to the west onto the Minch. Much of the mainland is sparsely populated, including parts of the Northwest Highlands mountains. The mainland&#x27;s principal towns are all on the east coast, including Dingwall (the county town), Alness, Cromarty, Fortrose, Invergordon and Tain. The largest settlement on the west coast was the village of Ullapool. The county also covered parts of the Outer Hebrides, principally the Isle of Lewis, including the town of Stornoway. The neighbouring counties were Sutherland to the north and Inverness-shire to the south.

The county ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975. Since then, the mainland has been part of the Highland region, which became a single-tier council area in 1996. The Outer Hebrides parts of the county became part of the Western Isles, which since 1998 has used only the Scots Gaelic version of its name, Na h-Eileanan an Iar. The pre-1975 county boundaries are still used for certain functions, being a registration county. There was a local government district called Ross and Cromarty from 1975 to 1996, which was a lower-tier district within the Highland region, covering most but not all of the mainland part of the pre-1975 county.

The Ross and Cromarty lieutenancy area, which prior to 1975 had been the county, was redefined in 1975 to be the Ross and Cromarty district plus the neighbouring Skye and Lochalsh district. The registration county and lieutenancy area therefore have slightly different definitions. Notable differences are that the registration county includes the Isle of Lewis and Kincardine, which are not in the lieutenancy area, whereas the lieutenancy area includes the Isle of Skye, which is not in the registration county. The lieutenancy area is in extent.

==History==
===Before 1889===
The mainland part of Ross and Cromarty broadly corresponds to the ancient province of Ross. This area was claimed by the Scottish crown from 1098, having previously been under Norwegian overlordship. It was initially included within the shire of Inverness following its incorporation into Scotland.

By the mid-13th century there were sheriffs based at Cromarty and Dingwall, both within the province of Ross, but each appears to have had only a small area of jurisdiction around those towns, rather than the larger territories usually given to sheriffs. The Sheriff of Inverness was therefore still responsible for most of Ross. The position of Sheriff of Dingwall did not endure. After a couple of abortive attempts, the rest of Ross was eventually separated from Inverness-shire in 1661, being given its own Sheriff of Ross and becoming Ross-shire.
The interests of landowners led to some variations in the 1661 definition of Ross-shire from the old province of Ross. In particular, the Isle of Lewis had not been in Ross but was included in Ross-shire on account of being owned by Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Seaforth, a major landowner in Ross. Conversely, an area north of the River Beauly including Beauly and Kilmorack had been in Ross but was excluded from Ross-shire on account of being owned by Clan Fraser of Lovat, based in Inverness-shire. Likewise the Ferintosh estate on the Black Isle was made an exclave of Nairnshire on account of being owned by the Forbes family. The small shire of Cromarty (which still just covered that town and its immediate vicinity) retained its independence. Cromartyshire was significantly enlarged in the late 17th century to gain numerous separate tracts of land scattered across Ross-shire which were owned by George Mackenzie, Viscount of Tarbat, who owned the barony of Cromarty.

Following the Jacobite rising of 1745, the government passed the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, returning the appointment of sheriffs to the crown in those cases where they had become hereditary positions, as had been the case for the Sheriff of Cromarty. The scope for a major landowner or clan chief to control the office of sheriff, which had been the major cause of Cromartyshire being separated from Ross-shire, was therefore greatly reduced. From 1748 the government merged the positions of Sheriff of Ross and Sheriff of Cromarty into a single position.

Despite sharing a sheriff from 1748, Ross-shire and Cromartyshire remained legally separate counties. They retained separate Commissioners of Supply (established in 1667), and from 1794 each appointed their own lord-lieutenants. From 1860 the commissioners of supply for the two counties were directed to work together on delivering some functions, notably relating to prisons.

===County===

The county of Ross and Cromarty was created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, covering the combined area of the two former counties of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire. The new county came into being on the passing of the act on 26 August 1889, from when the previously separate commissioners of supply for each former county merged into a single body, and the last Lord Lieutenant of Ross-shire, Kenneth Smith Mackenzie, became the first Lord Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty.

The act also established elected county councils, which came into effect in 1890, taking over most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The new Ross and Cromarty County Council held its first official meeting on 8 May 1890 at Dingwall Sheriff Court, which had been built in the 1840s as the main courthouse for Ross-shire and had also served as the meeting place for the commissioners. Kenneth Smith Mackenzie, already the lord lieutenant and a major landowner in the county, was also appointed the first convener of the county council.
The act also led to a review of boundaries, with exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parish and county boundaries being adjusted to eliminate cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. The main exclaves in the area prior to the act had been the many parts of Cromartyshire scattered across Ross-shire, which were resolved as a result of the two counties merging into one. After the merger, there still remained an exclave of Nairnshire at the Ferintosh estate on the Black Isle, whilst the parish of Urray straddled Inverness-shire and Ross and Cromarty. Ferintosh was transferred to Ross and Cromarty, and the parts of Urray in Inverness-shire were transferred to the Inverness-shire parish of Kilmorack. These boundary changes (and others to eliminate exclaves in parish boundaries) took effect in 1891.

Despite the creation of Ross and Cromarty in 1889, the Royal Mail used &#x27;Ross-shire&#x27; as the name of the postal county for the mainland part of Ross and Cromarty, including the parts which had been in Cromartyshire. Postal counties were officially discontinued in 1996.

Although the county was officially called Ross and Cromarty, the names &#x27;Ross County Council&#x27; and &#x27;Ross-shire County Council&#x27; were both also used for its county council in the media. Ross and Cromarty County Council built itself a new headquarters at County Buildings in Dingwall in 1965.

===Since 1975===
Local government was reformed in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts for most of Scotland. A single-tier structure of island areas was used for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles. The mainland of Ross and Cromarty became part of the Highland Region, whilst the Outer Hebrides parts (the landward district of Lewis and burgh of Stornoway) became part of the Western Isles.

The part of Ross and Cromarty which went to the Highland region was split between three lower-tier districts.
*Ross and Cromarty district, covering most of the mainland of the pre-1975 county, and the nearby islands that were not transferred to the Western Isles.
*Skye and Lochalsh district, covering the Isle of Skye district from Inverness-shire plus the South West District from Ross and Cromarty (comprising the parishes of Glenshiel, Kintail, and Lochalsh).
*Sutherland district, covering most of the pre-1975 county of Sutherland, plus the parish of Kincardine from Ross and Cromarty.

As part of the 1975 reforms, the last lord lieutenant of the county of Ross and Cromarty, Alexander Francis Matheson, became lord lieutenant of the new Ross and Cromarty lieutenancy area, which was defined as the combined area of the new Ross and Cromarty district plus the Skye and Lochalsh district.

The Ross and Cromarty District Council was based at the former county council&#x27;s headquarters at County Buildings in Dingwall. Throughout the district&#x27;s existence from 1975 to 1996, a majority of the seats were held by independent councillors.

Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with single-tier council areas. The former Highland region became one of the new council areas. The lieutenancy areas continue to be defined as they had been in 1975 despite the abolition of the districts on which they were based. The boundaries of the historic county of Ross and Cromarty (as it was following the 1891 boundary changes) are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

In 1998 the Western Isles Council formally changed the English language version of the area&#x27;s name from Western Isles to &quot;Na h-Eileanan an Iar&quot; (Scots Gaelic for &#x27;Western Isles&#x27;), to be used in both English and Gaelic contexts.

==Geography==

The western part of the county of Ross and Cromarty, also known as Wester Ross, is typified by its mountainous Highland scenery, especially the Torridon Hills which includes such peaks as Beinn Eighe and Liathach. The highest point in the county is Càrn Eighe at .

The west coast of the mainland onto The Minch and Inner Sound (opposite Skye), is heavily indented with sea lochs and peninsulas. From north to south the chief of these are the Coigach peninsula, Loch Broom, the Scoraig peninsula, Little Loch Broom, Gruinard Bay, Rubha Mòr peninsula, Loch Ewe, Rua Reidh/Melvaig peninsula, Loch Gairloch, Loch Torridon, Applecross peninsula, Loch Kishorn, Loch Carron, Lochalsh peninsula, Loch Long, Loch Duich and the Glenelg peninsula which is shared with Inverness-shire.

The eastern part (Easter Ross) is generally flatter, and consists of towns, villages and farmland bordering the Moray Firth. In the north Dornoch Firth separates the county from Sutherland. In the north-east can be found the hammerhead-shaped Tarbat peninsula; across Cromarty Firth lies the Black Isle (actually a peninsula not an island). To the south-east Beauly Firth forms the border with Inverness-shire.

The county contains numerous lochs, some of which have been enlarged to use as reservoirs. The larger inland lochs are:

*Fionn Loch
*Loch Cluanie
*Loch Damh
*Loch Fannich
*Loch Glass
*Loch Langabhat (on Lewis)
*Loch Loyne
*Loch Luichart
*Loch Maree
*Loch Mullardoch
*Orrin Reservoir
===Islands===
The county of Ross and Cromarty includes the northern parts of the Outer Hebrides, in particular the Isle of Lewis. Lewis is not an island on its own but forms part of the larger island of Lewis and Harris, which is the largest island of the Outer Hebrides and the third largest in the British Isles after Britain and Ireland. Harris is in Inverness-shire. Due to its flatter, more fertile land, Lewis contains three-quarters of the population of the Western Isles, and the largest settlement, Stornoway. The only other island in the Outer Hebrides that is in the county of Ross and Cromarty and was inhabited at the 2011 census was Great Bernera, which is linked to Lewis by a bridge. Ross and Cromarty also included some small and now uninhabited islands, including the remote Flannan Isles to the west of Lewis. About north of the Butt of Lewis lie North Rona and Sula Sgeir, a remote group of islands which were included within Ross and Cromarty.

The county also includes numerous smaller islands closer to the west coast of the mainland. Only three were inhabited at 2011, being Dry Island in Loch Gairloch, the Isle of Ewe in Loch Ewe, and Tanera Mòr in Loch Broom.

The Isle of Skye and several of its smaller neighbouring islands form part of the Ross and Cromarty lieutenancy area, but they form part of the registration county and historic county of Inverness-shire.

==Economy and population==
The main economic activities in Ross and Cromarty are crofting, fishing and tourism.

The parishes which make up the registration county (being the pre-1975 county) had a population of 77,382 at the 2011 census. The lieutenancy area (including Skye but excluding Lewis and Kincardine) had a population of 67,253.

==Civil parishes==
Parishes existed from medieval times. From 1845 to 1894 they had parish boards and from 1894 to 1930 they had parish councils. They have had no administrative functions since 1930, but continue to be used for the presentation of statistics.

Following the 1891 boundary changes, the county of Ross and Cromarty contained the following civil parishes:
# Alness
# Applecross
# Avoch
# Barvas (on Lewis)
# Contin
# Cromarty (included burgh of same name)
# Dingwall (included burgh of same name)
# Edderton
# Fearn
# Fodderty
# Gairloch
# Glenshiel
# Killearnan
# Kilmuir Easter
# Kiltearn
# Kincardine
# Kintail
# Knockbain
# Lochalsh
# Lochbroom
# Lochcarron
# Lochs (on Lewis)
# Logie Easter
# Nigg
# Resolis
# Rosemarkie (included burgh of Fortrose)
# Rosskeen (included burgh of Invergordon)
# Stornoway (included burgh of same name, on Lewis)
# Tain (included burgh of same name)
# Tarbat
# Uig (on Lewis)
# Urquhart and Logie Wester
# Urray
==Transport==
The Kyle of Lochalsh railway line traverses the county west–east, terminating at Inverness. The Far North Line goes north–south along the east coast, connecting Inverness in the south with Thurso and Wick in the north.

The Black Isle is connected by bridge to the &#x27;mainland&#x27; - Cromarty Bridge in the north-west and the Kessock Bridge in the south-west. At the tip of the peninsula a ferry provides access to the Tarbat peninsula. The Skye Bridge links Kyle of Lochalsh to the isle of Skye.

Various buses operated by Stagecoach Group link the major towns of the east coast, with the 61 bus connecting Ullapool to Inverness. The latter route is also served by Scottish Citylink in the summer, continuing on to Glasgow. Various independent bus companies link the smaller towns of Wester Ross, though online information is limited.

A ferry connects Stornoway on Lewis with Ullapool on the mainland, taking about three hours.

The county contains one airport - Stornoway - which provides passenger flights to destinations within Scotland as well as London Southend.

==Parliamentary constituency==
The name Ross and Cromarty was first used for the Ross and Cromarty county constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1832 to 1983. As created in 1832, the constituency merged two former county constituencies: the Ross-shire constituency and the Cromartyshire constituency, and it elected a Member of Parliament to represent the counties of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire, minus their parliamentary burghs, Dingwall, Tain and Fortrose, which were represented as components of the Wick burghs constituency and the Inverness burghs constituency.

Constituency boundaries were altered in 1918, by the Representation of the People Act 1918, and the Ross and Cromarty constituency acquired the boundaries of the county of Ross and Cromarty, including the former parliamentary burghs, but minus Stornoway and Lewis, which became part of a new constituency, the Western Isles constituency.

In 1983, the Ross, Cromarty and Skye constituency was created to represent the then Ross and Cromarty district and Skye and Lochalsh district. The Kincardine area joined the Caithness and Sutherland constituency.

<doc id="415436" wikidata="Q165600" url="?curid=415436" title="Baron de Ros">
<text>Baron de Ros ( ) of Helmsley is the premier baron in the Peerage of England, created in 1288/89 for William de Ros, with precedence to 24 December 1264. (The spelling of the title and of the surname of the original holders has been rendered differently in various texts. The word &quot;Ros&quot; is sometimes spelt &quot;Roos&quot;, and the word &quot;de&quot; is sometimes dropped.) &quot;Premier baron&quot; is a designation and status awarded to the holder of the most ancient extant barony of the Peerage of England. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Prior of the Order of St John in England was deemed the premier baron.

== Ancientness and precedence ==
On 24 December 1264 Robert de Ros (died 1285) was summoned to Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament in London, and for some time it was considered that the barony was created by writ in that year, giving it precedence over all other English titles unless certain doubtful contentions concerning the title of the Earl of Arundel were accepted. The only older peerage titles in the British Isles are: Baron Kerry and Lixnaw (1181, held by the Marquess of Lansdowne), Baron Offaly (1199, later creation held by the Duke of Leinster), and Baron Kingsale (c. 1223) in the Peerage of Ireland, and Earl of Mar (predates 1115) and Earl of Sutherland (1230) in the Peerage of Scotland.

According to &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;:

==Style==
Whenever a man holds the title, he is considered the premier baron of England. However, whenever a woman holds the title, the holder of the next-highest barony held by a man is known as the premier baron. For instance, when Georgiana Maxwell, the most recent female to hold the title, was baroness, the Baron Mowbray, Segrave, and Stourton was considered the premier baron.

== Remainder ==
The Barony may pass to heirs-general rather than just heirs-male, unlike most British titles. The barony may pass to daughters only if there are no sons. Under inheritance law, sisters have an equal right to inherit; there is no special inheritance right due for the eldest sister, as there is for the eldest son. Thus, it is possible that two or more sisters (and their heirs after their deaths) have an equally valid claim to the title; in such a case, the title goes into abeyance. The abeyance ends either when there is only one remaining claimant due to the deaths of the other claimants, or when the Sovereign &quot;terminates&quot; the abeyance in favour of one of the heirs. The peerage has been held by a woman six times, more than any other peerage except that of Baron Willoughby de Eresby.

== Descent ==
The title was originally held by the de Ros family until the death of the tenth Baron in 1508, when it was inherited by his nephew, the 11th Baron. His son, Thomas, inherited the barony and was later created Earl of Rutland. The barony and earldom remained united until the death of the third Earl, Edward Manners. The barony was then inherited by his only daughter, Elizabeth Cecil, while the earldom passed to a male heir, his younger brother. Upon the death of Elizabeth&#x27;s only son, William Cecil, the title returned to the Manners family, being inherited by the sixth Earl of Rutland.

Again, upon the sixth Earl&#x27;s death, the barony and earldom were separated (the earldom being inherited by a distant cousin, the great-nephew of the 2nd earl), as the barony was inherited by the Earl&#x27;s daughter Katherine, who had married George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Katherine&#x27;s son George inherited both the barony and the dukedom, but upon his death the dukedom became extinct and the barony went into abeyance.

The barony had been in abeyance for over a century when Charlotte Boyle-Walsingham who was later to marry Lord Henry FitzGerald, a son of the 4th Duke of Leinster) petitioned King George III to terminate the abeyance in her favour in 1790. (She was the daughter of Robert Boyle-Walsingham by his wife Charlotte, daughter of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams by his wife Frances, daughter of Thomas Coningsby, 1st Earl Coningsby by his wife Frances, daughter of Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, son of William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham by his wife Frances, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland who was a younger brother of the 14th Baron de Ros.) The King referred the matter to the House of Lords, which recommended that the barony remain in abeyance. However, in 1806, George III terminated the abeyance in her favour on the recommendation of his Prime Minister. Charlotte and her heirs then took the additional surname of &quot;de Ros&quot; after &quot;FitzGerald&quot;.

The title eventually went into abeyance again upon the death of the 25th Baroness, in 1939. The abeyance was terminated in favour of her eldest daughter, Lady Una Mary Ross (née Dawson) in 1943, and again went into abeyance upon her death in 1956. Two years later, the barony was called out of abeyance again for Una Ross&#x27;s granddaughter, Georgiana Maxwell (née Ross). the title is held by her son the 27th Baron, the first man to hold the title in over three-quarters of a century, who succeeded his mother in 1983.

The family seat is Old Court, near Strangford, County Down.

<text>The Struma or Strymónas (Bulgarian: Струма ; ;) is a river in Bulgaria and Greece. Its ancient name was Strymṓn (Greek: Στρυμών ). Its drainage area is , of which in Bulgaria, in Greece and the remaining in North Macedonia and Serbia. It takes its source from the Vitosha Mountain in Bulgaria, runs first westward, then southward, forming a number of gorges, enters Greece near the village of Promachonas in eastern Macedonia. In Greece it is the main waterway feeding and exiting from Lake Kerkini, a significant centre for migratory wildfowl. Also in Greece, the river entirely flows in the Serres regional unit into the Strymonian Gulf in Aegean Sea, near Amphipolis. The river&#x27;s length is (of which in Bulgaria, making it the country&#x27;s fifth-longest and one of the longest rivers that run solely in the interior of the Balkans. 

Parts of the river valley belong to a Bulgarian coal-producing area, more significant in the past than nowadays; the southern part of the Bulgarian section is an important wine region. The Greek portion is a valley which is dominant in agriculture, being Greece&#x27;s fourth-biggest valley. The tributaries include the Konska River, the Dragovishtitsa, the Rilska River, the Blagoevgradska Bistritsa, the Sandanska Bistritsa, the Strumitsa, the Pirinska Bistritsa and the Angitis.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name comes from Thracian , derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*&quot; &#x27;stream&#x27;, akin to English &quot;stream&quot;, Old Irish &#x27;river&#x27;, Polish &#x27;stream&#x27;, Lithuanian &quot;straumuo&quot; &#x27;fast stream&#x27;, Bulgarian () &#x27;water flow&#x27;, Greek () &#x27;stream&#x27;, Albanian &#x27;water flow&#x27;, &#x27;rain&#x27;.

The name &quot;Strymón&quot; was a hydronym in ancient Greek mythology, referring to a mythical Thracian king that was drowned in the river. Strymón was also used as a personal name in various regions of Ancient Greece during the 3rd century BC.

In Macedonian it is called Струма ; while in , &#x27;black water&#x27;).

==History==
In 437 BC, the ancient Greek city of Amphipolis was founded near the river&#x27;s entrance to the Aegean, at the site previously known as (&#x27;Nine roads&#x27;). When Xerxes I of Persia crossed the river during his invasion in 480 BC he buried alive nine young boys and nine maidens as a sacrifice to the river god. The forces of Alexander I of Macedon defeated the remnants of Xerxes&#x27; army near Ennea Hodoi in 479 BC. In 424 BC the Spartan general Brasidas after crossing the entire Greek peninsula sieged and conquered Amphipolis. According to the ancient sources, the river was navigable from its mouth up to the ancient (and today dried) Cercinitis lake, which also favored the navigation; and thus was formed in antiquity an important waterway that served the communication between the coasts of Strymonian Gulf and the Thracian hinterland and almost to the city of Serres.

The decisive Battle of Kleidion was fought close the river in 1014 between the Bulgarians under Emperor Samuel and the Byzantines under Emperor Basil II and determined the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire four years later. In 1913, the Greek Army was nearly surrounded in the Kresna Gorge of the Struma by the Bulgarian Army during the Second Balkan War, and the Greeks were forced to ask for armistice. 

The river valley was part of the Macedonian front in World War I. The ship , which took Jewish refugees out of Romania in World War II and was torpedoed and sunk in the Black Sea, causing nearly 800 deaths, was named after the river.

== Protected areas and ecology ==
The river&#x27;s mouth and Lake Kerkini, a lake that the river is feeding and exiting, are both national parks and part of the Natura 2000 network. More than 300 bird species have been observed at these locations and some of them are considered endangered or vulnerable, like the saker falcon, the eastern imperial eagle and the greater spotted eagle. The Greek lamprey, which is listed as a critically endangered species on the IUCN Red List and is considered the rarest species of lamprey in the world, is only found at the Struma basin and the basin of the much smaller Louros river.

<text>Martin Olav Sabo (February 28, 1938 – March 13, 2016) was an American politician who served as United States Representative for , which includes Minneapolis; the district is one of eight congressional districts in Minnesota.

==Early life and education==
Sabo was born in Crosby, North Dakota, the son of Norwegian immigrant parents. He received a B.A. from Augsburg College in Minneapolis in 1959, later pursuing graduate studies at the University of Minnesota.

== Career ==

=== Minnesota Legislature ===
He was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1960 at the age of 22, later serving as minority leader (1969–72) and as the first Democrat to serve as house speaker (1973–78). During his tenure in the state house he served terms as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures and of the National Legislative Conference, and was a presidential appointee to the National Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.

=== U.S. Congress ===
When eight-term incumbent and fellow Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) member Donald M. Fraser stepped down to run for the U.S. Senate, Sabo became the DFL candidate to succeed him in what had become the most reliably Democratic district in Minnesota (Fraser had defeated a 10-term Republican in 1962 and hadn&#x27;t faced serious opposition since). He won easily in November 1978 and was reelected thirteen times without serious opposition, serving in the 96th, 97th, 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th and 109th congresses.

During the 103rd Congress (1993–94) he chaired the House Budget Committee. As chairman of the Committee, he shepherded the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 through the House, legislation that allowed the United States to erase its budget deficit by 1999. (The deficit subsequently returned.) In the 109th United States Congress he sat on the House Appropriations Committee, and was the ranking member of that committee&#x27;s Homeland Security subcommittee.

A Lutheran, Sabo was married and had two children and six grandchildren. His daughter, Julie Sabo, is a former member of the Minnesota Senate and was the 2002 DFL nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota. Sabo was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame in 1994. During the course of his career Sabo referred to himself as a &quot;liberal decentrist&quot;, preferring progressive politics, but local control instead of federal control.

Sabo was considered to be the most liberal member of the Minnesota delegation in the 109th Congress, scoring 4% conservative by a conservative group and 90% progressive by a liberal group.

=== Later career ===

On March 18, 2006, he announced that he would not seek reelection for the 110th Congress, ending 46 years as an elected official, including 28 years in Congress – the third-longest tenure in either house of Congress in the state&#x27;s history, behind only fellow Democrats Jim Oberstar and Collin Peterson. He endorsed his longtime chief of staff Mike Erlandson in the DFL primary—the real contest in this district. Erlandson lost to State Representative Keith Ellison, also a progressive DFLer, who in turn won the general election and succeeded Sabo on January 4, 2007.

Sabo served as a co-chair of the National Transportation Policy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. For his work on acquiring funding for transportation projects and specifically pedestrian and bicycling funding, the Midtown Greenway bridge in Minneapolis was named the Martin Olav Sabo Bridge.

==Personal life==
Sabo died March 13, 2016, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the age of 78. He had been hospitalized with breathing difficulties.

U.S Senator Amy Klobuchar called Sabo a &quot;friend and mentor,&quot; and Governor Mark Dayton praised him as &quot;a great political leader and an outstanding public servant.&quot; Sabo was a lifelong smoker until he quit in 2003.

**Daniel Mathias (R), 24%

<text>The McCaughey septuplets (; born November 19, 1997) are septuplets born to Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey in Des Moines, Iowa. They are the world&#x27;s first known set of surviving septuplets.

==Background, conception and birth==
Kenny McCaughey (b. 1969) and Bobbi McCaughey (b. 1968), were residents of the town of Carlisle, Iowa. The McCaugheys have one older daughter, Mikayla Marie, born January 3, 1996. While under treatment with ovulation-stimulating Metrodin for infertility, Bobbi became pregnant with seven babies. The McCaugheys declined selective reduction to reduce the number of infants, saying that they would &quot;put it in God&#x27;s hands&quot;. The obstetricians primarily responsible for the medical care of Bobbi and the babies were Karen Drake and Paula Mahone.

The septuplets, four boys and three girls, were born prematurely at the Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines on November 19, 1997. They were delivered by a scheduled Caesarean section, attended by a team of 40 specialists, all within six minutes.

The babies&#x27; names, birth weight, time of birth, and order of birth are as follows:

Two of the septuplets, Alexis and Nathan, have cerebral palsy. Both use walkers to get around, and in November 2005, Nathan had spinal surgery in order to improve his walking abilities.

==Media and public response==
The birth attracted significant media attention, both positive and negative, including a feature in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in December 1997. &quot;In the beginning, for every ten letters we would get that were happy for us, we&#x27;d get one letter accusing us of exploiting the kids and being selfish to waste the world&#x27;s resources on a family this big,&quot; said Bobbi in a 2007 interview. &quot;Our neighbors never gawked. Here in Carlisle they gave us privacy. But we had complete strangers come around to the back door, knock, and ask if they could hold a baby.&quot;

The McCaugheys were the recipients of many donations, including a 5,500 ft² (511 m2) house, a van, nanny services, clothes, and diapers for the first two years. The State of Iowa offered full college scholarships to any state university in Iowa upon the children&#x27;s graduation from high school. Hannibal–LaGrange University, in Hannibal, Missouri, also offered full scholarships to the children when they were born. President Bill Clinton personally telephoned the McCaugheys to congratulate them. The surviving Dionne quintuplets (Yvonne Dionne, Annette Allard, and Cécile Langlois) wrote an open letter warning the parents to keep the septuplets out of the public eye and not allow them to fall into the same pitfalls as their parents did, but they congratulated Bobbi and Kenny and wished them the best of luck in raising the children. The letter reads as follows:
By the septuplets&#x27; tenth birthday in 2007, the family was declining most requests for interviews, other than annual stories with the Des Moines CBS television affiliate KCCI and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. Bobbi McCaughey has noted that the level of media attention does not necessarily mean they have granted many interviews, saying, &quot;There was all kinds of stuff in the papers early on but they never actually interviewed us. Most of it is one paper quoting another&quot;.

Bobbi and Kenny both occasionally speak at anti-abortion events and continue to oppose selective reduction. Bobbi has been quoted as saying, &quot;Well, come to our house, and tell me which four I shouldn&#x27;t have had!&quot; The family continues to attend a Baptist church in West Des Moines, Iowa, where Kenny serves as a deacon. In 2010, for the septuplets&#x27; 13th birthday, a documentary was made by TLC chronicling the event.

==Later lives==
The septuplets graduated from Carlisle High School in May 2016. Natalie, Kelsey, Nathan and Joel took up scholarships offered by Hannibal-LaGrange University. Kenny and Alexis chose to stay in the Des Moines area and attend Des Moines Area Community College, and Brandon enlisted in the United States Army.

In 2017, the septuplets became aunts and uncles when their sister Mikayla gave birth to a son after getting married in 2015. In May 2019, Natalie was the first of the septuplets to get married. Brandon also got married in August 2019. By the end of 2022, when the septuplets turned 25, Brandon and Kenny had become fathers.

<text>Samuel Ryan Curtis (February 3, 1805 – December 26, 1866) was an American military officer and one of the first Republicans elected to Congress. He was most famous for his role as a Union Army general in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War, especially for his victories at the Battles of Pea Ridge in 1862 and Westport in 1864.

==Early life, Mexican–American War and politics==
Born near Champlain, New York, Curtis graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1831. He was stationed at Fort Gibson in the Indian Territories (present-day Oklahoma) before resigning from the Army in 1832.

He moved to Ohio, where he worked as a civil engineer on the Muskingum River improvement projects and also became a lawyer in 1841. During the Mexican–American War, he was appointed colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Ohio Volunteers and served as military governor of several occupied cities.
After the war in the 1850s, he served as chief engineer for river improvements in Des Moines, Iowa, for public infrastructure works in St. Louis, as well as for the American Central Railroad in Iowa. He became Mayor of Keokuk in 1856 and in the same year was elected as a Republican to represent Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Curtis and Timothy Davis (elected the same day to represent Iowa&#x27;s 2nd congressional district) were the first Iowa Republicans elected to serve in the U.S. House. Curtis was re-elected in 1858 and 1860; during his time in Congress, he was a strong advocate of a transcontinental railroad.

==Civil War service==
He was a supporter of Abraham Lincoln, and was considered for a cabinet position in the Lincoln administration. However, after the Civil War broke out, Curtis was appointed colonel of the 2nd Iowa Infantry on June 1, 1861, prompting him to resign his congressional seat on August 4 of that year. He was subsequently promoted to brigadier general, with the promotion backdated to May 17, 1861.

After organizing the chaos in St. Louis, Missouri, Curtis was given command of the Army of the Southwest on December 25, 1861, by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck. The Army originally consisted of three divisions, the 1st commanded by Brig. Gen. Franz Sigel, the 2nd by Brig. Gen. Alexander Asboth, and the 3rd by Col. Jefferson C. Davis. However, Sigel, a native German who held significant influence amongst the many German immigrants in the army, threatened to resign over having not been appointed to command of the army himself. Curtis subsequently gave him overall command of the first two divisions, consisting mainly of German immigrants, while creating a 4th Division commanded by Col. Eugene A. Carr.

Curtis moved his headquarters south to Rolla, Missouri, to solidify Union control in Arkansas. In March 1862, his army won the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas. His success made him pensive rather than triumphant. A few days after the battle he wrote, &quot;The scene is silent and sad. The vulture and the wolf now have the dominion and the dead friends and foes sleep in the same lonely graves.&quot; He was promoted to major general for his success, effective March 21, 1862. On the same day in late March that he heard about his promotion, he also found out that his twenty-year-old daughter Sadie died of typhoid fever in St. Louis.

After Pea Ridge, Curtis&#x27; small army moved east and invaded northeast Arkansas, capturing the city of Helena, Arkansas in July. In September, Curtis was given command of the District of Missouri, but Lincoln was soon forced to reassign him, after Curtis&#x27;s abolitionist views led to conflict with the governor of Missouri. He was reassigned to command the Department of Kansas &amp; Indian Territory.

In October 1863, his son Major Henry Zarah Curtis, adjutant to Brig. Gen. James G. Blunt, was killed by Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders. In this surprise attack at the Battle of Baxter Springs, Quantrill&#x27;s men wore Federal uniforms and gave no quarter. Samuel Curtis named Fort Zarah in memory of his son.

In 1864, Curtis returned to Missouri, fighting against the Confederate invasion led by Maj. Gen. Sterling Price. Curtis gathered the forces of his department together, including several regiments of Kansas State Militia, calling his force the Army of the Border. Price&#x27;s incursion was halted by Curtis&#x27; victory at the Battle of Westport. Curtis was then reassigned to a completely different armed conflict, commanding the Army&#x27;s &quot;Department of the Northwest,&quot; which was in the closing phase of a military response to uprisings in southern Minnesota and Dakota Territory by Native Americans against settlers.

==Later life and death==
In late 1865, he returned to Iowa where he was involved with the Union Pacific Railroad until his death the following year in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery, in Keokuk.

<doc id="415452" wikidata="Q806085" url="?curid=415452" title="Banana Republic">
<text>Banana Republic is an American upscale clothing and accessories retailer owned by The Gap. It was founded in 1978 by Mel and Patricia Ziegler, who originally called the company &quot;Banana Republic Travel &amp; Safari Clothing Company&quot;. In 1983, Gap purchased the company, changed the name to &quot;Banana Republic&quot;, and rebranded the stores to achieve a more upscale image. In the 2020s, VP of design Nicole Wiesmann has re-envisioned the brand with ad editorial campaigns that evoke luxury brands, and higher-end garments that have been compared favorably with names such as Ralph Lauren and The Row.

==History==
The original Banana Republic was founded by Mel and Patricia Ziegler in 1978. The couple worked for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;; Mel was a reporter and Patricia an illustrator. They lived in an apartment on Russian Hill. In 1978, they quit their jobs and moved to Tamalpais Valley. They wanted to start a business for income. But first, Mel received a magazine assignment to explore Australia for a few weeks with other journalists. The couple was known for acquiring interesting clothing items that their travel-related jobs brought them in contact with. They eventually opened a store in the Mill Valley area of Northern California. They were known for a hand-drawn catalogue of items with traveler/explorer stories printed alongside, and their safari-themed retail locations. The Zieglers recount their adventures in the first ten years in their memoir, &quot;Wild Company&quot;, published in 2012 by Simon and Schuster.

Gap Inc. acquired Banana Republic in 1983. By 1988 the founders, Mel and Patricia Ziegler, lost creative control, eventually rebranding it as masstige, an accessible mass luxury clothing retailer. The literate articles, hand-drawn catalog, and eccentric tourist-oriented items were phased out and were replaced with more luxurious, but not unique, items for which the brand would eventually become known, currently replacing higher quality materials for mass quality lower cost fabric standards.

==Retail history==
In 2015 Banana Republic opened a new flagship in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street.

Banana Republic opened its first store outside North America in 2005 in Tokyo&#x27;s Ginza shopping district. Banana Republic&#x27;s presence in South Korea debuted in August 2007 with a store in the Apgujeong district of Seoul.

In 2007, the first Banana Republic stores opened at The Avenues shopping mall in Kuwait City, Kuwait; Senayan City in Jakarta, Indonesia; and Pavilion Kuala Lumpur in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Banana Republic opened its first store in Turkey in March 2008 in the Kanyon Shopping Mall in Istanbul. By May 2008, İstinye Park Shopping Mall and Nişantaşı stores were also opened in Istanbul. More stores are planned to be opened in Ankara and İzmir by the end of 2008 to bring the total number of stores in Turkey to six.

Banana Republic opened in Saudi Arabia in late 2008, with a store in Mall of Arabia in Jeddah and a second in Riyadh Gallery Mall in Riyadh in March 2009.

In March 2008, Banana Republic opened its store on Regent Street in London, England. On May 9, 2008, Banana Republic opened its store on Greenbelt 5 in Makati, Philippines.

In October 2016, Banana Republic announced that it would close all its UK stores by the end of the year, due to falling sales. As of 2017, Banana Republic had over 700 locations, but as a result of European stores closures, there are none left in Europe.

In August 2020, Banana Republic alongside Gap announced that they will close over 225 store locations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The original plan was to close only 90 stores, however, they expanded the number as a consequence of the financial effects caused by the pandemic. The company has not stated the exact locations that will be closed, but most will be stores within malls.

Banana Republic produced a fall/winter capsule collection with New York-based fashion designer Peter Do in 2023.

==Clothing lines==
==Stores==

In 2011, Banana Republic had 682 company-owned or franchised stores in operation across 32 countries, shipped to 21 countries through company owned websites, and had the ability to ship to more than 50 countries through a third party. By late 2022, the total number of US stores fell to just 379, including three outlets in Puerto Rico, while the number of outlets in Canada climbed to 62. The company closed all eight of its UK and Ireland stores in 2016, and shut down all of the brand&#x27;s European websites in May 2022. As of January 2025, Banana Republic has 18 stores in Japan, counting regular and outlet stores, the newest opening was on January 31, in Toranomon Hills.

<text>Lieutenancy areas , officially counties and areas for the purposes of the lieutenancies, are the separate areas of the United Kingdom appointed to a lord-lieutenant – a representative of the British monarch. In many cases they have similar demarcation and naming to, but are not necessarily coterminate with, the counties of the United Kingdom.

==Origin==
In England, lieutenancy areas are colloquially known as the ceremonial counties, although this phrase does not appear in any legislation referring to them. The lieutenancy areas of Scotland are subdivisions of Scotland that are more or less based on the counties of Scotland, making use of the major cities as separate entities. In Wales, the lieutenancy areas are known as the preserved counties of Wales and are based on those used for lieutenancy and local government between 1974 and 1996. The lieutenancy areas of Northern Ireland correspond to the six counties and two former county boroughs.

<text>The Boboli Gardens ( /’bo.bo.li/) is a historical park of the city of Florence that was opened to the public in 1766. Originally designed for the Medici, it represents one of the first and most important examples of the Italian garden, which later served as inspiration for many European courts. Statues of various styles and periods, ancient and Renaissance, dot the garden. It also has large fountains and artificial caves, notably a grotto built by the artist, architect, and sculptor Bernardo Buontalenti between 1536 and 1608.

The Gardens, directly behind the Pitti Palace, the main seat of the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany at Florence, are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable &quot;built&quot; element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: grottos, nympheums, garden temples and the like. The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties are ever known to have taken place in the gardens.

The Boboli Gardens were laid out for Eleonora di Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. The name may be a corruption of &quot;Bogoli&quot; or &quot;Borgoli&quot;, possibly the name of a family who had previously owned the land. The first stage had scarcely been begun by Niccolò Tribolo when he died in 1550, after which the construction was continued by Bartolomeo Ammanati. Giorgio Vasari contributed to the planning, and Bernardo Buontalenti contributed sculptures, as well as the elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden.

The garden lacks a natural water source. To water its plants, a conduit was built to feed water from the nearby Arno River into an elaborate irrigation system.

The primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep amphitheater; its shape resembles half of a classical hippodrome or racecourse. At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the Ancient Egyptian Boboli obelisk brought from the Villa Medici at Rome. This primary axis terminates in a fountain of Neptune (known to the irreverent Florentines as the &quot;Fountain of the Fork&quot; for Neptune&#x27;s trident); the sculpture of Neptune, by Stoldo Lorenzi, is visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope.

Giulio Parigi laid out the long secondary axis, the &quot;Viottolone&quot; or &quot;Cyprus Road&quot; at a right angle to the primary axis. This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the bosquets on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. In 1617, Parigi constructed the &quot;Grotto of Vulcan&quot; (&quot;Grotticina di Vulcano&quot;) along this axis.

The gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 450,000 meters² (111 acres). The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works.

In the first phase of building, the amphitheatre was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean (sculpted by Giambologna, later transferred to another location within the same garden). The small Grotto of Madama and the Large Grotto were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.

Even while undergoing restoration work in 2015, the Large Grotto&#x27;s statues were still on display; they are defining examples of Mannerist sculpture and architecture. Decorated internally and externally with stalactites and originally equipped with waterworks and luxuriant vegetation, the grotto is divided into three main sections. The first one was frescoed to create the illusion of a natural grotto, a refuge that allows shepherds to protect themselves from wild animals; it originally housed &quot;The Prisoners&quot; of Michelangelo (now replaced by copies), statues that were first intended for the tomb of the Pope Julius II. Other rooms in the Grotto contain Giambologna&#x27;s famous &quot;Bathing Venus&quot; and an 18th-century group of &quot;Paris and Helen&quot; by Vincenzo de&#x27; Rossi.

==The Fountain of Neptune==
In the hillside above the amphitheatre is a double ramp, leading to the &quot;Fountain of Neptune&quot;. Its main feature is a large basin with a central bronze statue of &quot;Neptune&quot;, made by Stoldo Lorenzi some time between 1565 and 1568. The fountain was constructed contemporaneously with its more famous counterpart, Ammannati&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Neptune&quot;, which is at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio at the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. Higher up on the hillside is a statue of &quot;Abundance&quot; (&quot;Dovizia&quot;). Collectively, these works seem to allude to a legend in which the gods Athena and Neptune are competing for the role of the patron of Athens. In that legend, Neptune strikes the ground with his trident, causing water to spring forth from it.

==Fontana del Bacchino==
The &quot;Fontana del Bacchino&quot; is a 1560 sculptural work by Valerio Cioli (1529–1599) featuring a statue in the likeness of the famed dwarf buffoon from the court of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Nano Morgante modeled after Bacchus and riding a tortoise. In 1572 the statue was turned into a fountain.

==The Isolotto==
The Isolotto is an oval-shaped island in a tree-enclosed pond, and is nearly at the end of the alternative Viottolone axis. In the centre of the island is the Fountain of the Ocean, and in the surrounding moat, there are statues of Perseus and Andromeda (school of Giambologna). The Isolotto was laid out by Giulio and Alfonso Parigi, circa 1618.

<doc id="415470" wikidata="Q623099" url="?curid=415470" title="Odorheiu Secuiesc">
<text>Odorheiu Secuiesc (; , ; ) is the second largest municipality in Harghita County, Transylvania, Romania. In its short form, it is also known as &quot;Odorhei&quot; in Romanian and &quot;Udvarhely&quot; in Hungarian. The Hungarian name of the town &quot;Udvarhely&quot; means &quot;courtyard place&quot;.

== Demographics ==
At the 2011 census, the city had a population of 34,257; among those for whom data were available, 95.8% were ethnic Hungarians, making it the urban settlement with the third-highest proportion of Hungarians in Romania. The city was also home to communities of ethnic Romanians (2.6%) and Roma (1.5%). According to the 2021 census, Odorheiu Secuiesc had a population of 31,335; of those, 87.29% were Hungarians, 2.3% Romanians, and 1.58% Roma. 

As of 2011, half the population of the town professed Roman Catholicism (50.05%), while the remaining half was primarily divided between Hungarian Reformed (30.14%), Unitarian (14.71%), and Romanian Orthodox (2.54%) communities.

==History==
A Roman fortress was found under the ruins of a medieval fort in the centre of the town. A funeral inscription was also found placed by the veteran, Aelius Equester, former centurion, to his wife Aurelia Juiuni and himself. The inscription dates back to the 7th century AD. Stamps with the letters of the Alpinorum equitata cohort and the Ubiorum cohort were also found in Odorhei. The town, as the former seat of the Udvarhely &quot;comitatus&quot;, is one of the historical centers of Székely Land. The first known reference to the city was in a papal register of duties in 1334 when it was mentioned by its Hungarian name, a &quot;sacerdos de Oduorhel&quot;. Since 1615, when Gabriel Bethlen, Prince of Transylvania, reaffirmed the rights of the town, the place has been referred to as Székelyudvarhely.

Udvarhely was the location of the first assembly of Székelys in 1357. A fortress was built in the town in 1451. It was rebuilt and strengthened by John II Sigismund Zápolya in 1565, in order to control the Székelys. Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave allied with the Szekelys and the Habsburgs destroyed the fortress in 1599 during their campaign in Transylvania. It was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed again during history. The ruins of the structure are nowadays known as &quot;The Székely-Attacked Fortress&quot;.

The town was historically part of the Szeklerland region of Transylvania. It was the seat of Udvarhelyszék District until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the Udvarhely County in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the aftermath of World War I, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was declared in December 1918. At the start of the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, the town passed under Romanian administration. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of the Kingdom of Romania and was the seat of Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary. Towards the end of World War II, Romanian and Soviet armies entered the town in September 1944. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until 9 March 1945, after which it became again part of Romania. In 1950, after Communist Romania was established, the city became the headquarters of the Odorhei Raion of Stalin Region. Between 1952 and 1960, the town fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. After the administrative reform of 1968, the region was abolished, and since then, the town has been part of Harghita County.

The town and the surrounding villages were hit by a significant flood in August 2005.

A statue park of historical persons of importance for the Székelys was unveiled in the town on 22 May 2004. This gave rise to controversy, as one of the statues (&quot;The Wandering Szekler&quot;) was interpreted in the Romanian press as being the portrait of controversial writer and poet Albert Wass.

==Education==
The town is renowned in the region for its long and distinguished tradition in secondary education. Its oldest and foremost secondary school is Liceul Teoretic Tamasi Aron Gimnazium (founded by Jesuits in 1593). The lyceum/gimnazium is one of the oldest Hungarian institutions of learning; its current building is an architectural masterpiece of Art Nouveau. Other notable secondary schools include: Backamadarasi Kis Gergely Reformed College (founded in 1670 as one of the most important places of learning by the Hungarian Reformed Church in Transylvania); Benedek Elek Teachers&#x27; College (its main building is a monument); Pallo Imre Art and Music School; Eotvos Jozsef Agricultural Technological School.

Odorheiu Secuiesc currently has one institution of higher education College of Modern Business Studies, an affiliate of Edutus College in Tatabanya (Hungary), with degrees in tourism and hospitality management, business administration, marketing and communication, development and economics, agricultural technology, forestry management and e-business. Dual degrees are also offered with Budapest Business School, University of Pannonia in Keszthely, Óbuda University in Budapest, and Széchenyi István University in Győr (Hungary).

== Politics ==

The mayor of Odorheiu Secuiesc is Árpád Gálfi, re-elected in 2020. At the 2020 elections he represented the Partidul Oamenilor Liberi (Hungarian: &quot;Szabad Emberek Pártja&quot;, &quot;Party of Free People&quot;), but he was deprived of membership in that party in April 2021.

The city council has 19 members:

== Tourism ==

Odorheiu Secuiesc is a small yet culturally vibrant town. It has a sizeable theater, the Haáz Rezső Museum (featuring permanent and seasonal exhibits dedicated to Szekler village life, Szekler arts and crafts, the history of the region, and a growing collection of Hungarian painters in Transylvania), a philharmonic orchestra of Szeklerland, a local TV studio, and several local newspapers. Throughout the year, there are festivals and youth events, a monthly farmer&#x27;s market selling local, traditional and organic products. With strong cultural ties to Hungary, the town frequently hosts artists, writers and bands from Hungary. The town also features a central park, a large open air pool and several spas. Its main square, flanked by historic public buildings, is Márton Áron Square, or as the locals call it, Horseshoe Square (due to its shape).

Odorheiu Secuiesc and the area have some great touristic attractions, such as a bike path to (also the burial ground of the Szekler ethnographer Balázs Orbán) and the Mineral Water Trails Museum, the low-Alpine-type ski resort of (part of the eastern range of the Carpathian Mountains) as well as charming mountain bungalows and farm guest houses on the mountainous paths and Alpine slopes leading to the Madaras Peak (with genuine farm-to-table dining experiences), in addition to several mineral water springs and pools (Homorod Spa, , with great fishing and hunting. The pottery village of Corund, a popular destination for those who love Hungarian pottery and traditional folk patterns, is only away from the city. The salty Bear Lake in Sovata, a significant resort town that has been recently redeveloped, is also less than one hour&#x27;s drive away (46 km).

The region has seen increased interest in eco-tourism, wildlife hiking and bear-watching, biking, rock climbing, horse riding, photo-tourism and cultural tourism. 

The town is an ideal day-trip destination for tourists exploring the richness and diversity of Transylvania due to its closeness to the Medieval (formerly) Saxon towns of Sighișoara (50 km), Brașov (109 km), Sibiu (150 km), as well as the world-famous Bran Castle, better known as Dracula Castle, (130 km), yet it offers a different cultural experience thanks to its carefully preserved Hungarian culture. The surrounding villages showcase traditional Szekler-Hungarian house-building techniques and woodcraft, such as the stooped . The rich and distinctive furniture-carving and painting techniques of villages in Szeklerland were showcased in the Smithsonian Folklife Festival&#x27;s Hungarian Heritage program in June 2013 in Washington, D.C., USA.

The closest airport is Târgu Mureș International Airport (110 km) with direct flights (Rynair, Wizzair, or Tarom) to Budapest, London, Barcelona, Bergamo, Bologna, Madrid, Rome, Bucharest, Brussels, and Pisa.

The route of the Via Transilvanica long-distance trail passes through the city.

<doc id="415475" wikidata="Q2631278" url="?curid=415475" title="First Australian Imperial Force">
<text>The First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) was the main expeditionary force of the Australian Army during the First World War. It was formed as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) following Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany on 15 August 1914, with an initial strength of one infantry division and one light horse brigade. The infantry division subsequently fought at Gallipoli between April and December 1915, with a newly raised second division, as well as three light horse brigades, reinforcing the committed units.

After being evacuated to Egypt, the AIF was expanded to five infantry divisions, which were committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front in March 1916. A sixth infantry division was partially raised in 1917 in the United Kingdom, but was broken up and used as reinforcements following heavy casualties on the Western Front. Meanwhile, two mounted divisions remained in the Middle East to fight against Turkish forces in the Sinai and Palestine. The AIF included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), the predecessor to the Royal Australian Air Force, which consisted of four combat and four training squadrons that were deployed to the United Kingdom, the Western Front and the Middle East throughout the war.

An all volunteer force, by the end of the war the AIF had gained a reputation as being a well-trained and highly effective military force, playing a significant role in the final Allied victory. However, this reputation came at a heavy cost with a casualty rate among the highest of any belligerent for the war. The remaining troops were repatriated until the disbandment of the 1st AIF between 1919 and 1921. After the war, the achievements of the AIF and its soldiers, known colloquially as &quot;Diggers&quot;, became central to the national mythology of the &quot;Anzac legend&quot;. Generally known at the time as &quot;the&quot; AIF, it is today referred to as the &quot;1st AIF&quot; to distinguish it from the Second Australian Imperial Force raised during World War II.

==Formation==

At the start of the war, Australia&#x27;s military forces were focused upon the part-time Militia. The small number of regular personnel were mostly artillerymen or engineers, and were generally assigned to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot;, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. The Australian government pledged to supply 20,000 men organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units, for service &quot;wherever the British desired&quot;, in keeping with pre-war Imperial defence planning. The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) subsequently began forming shortly after the outbreak of war and was the brain child of Brigadier General William Throsby Bridges (later Major General) and his chief of staff, Major Brudenell White. Officially coming into being on 15 August 1914, the word &#x27;imperial&#x27; was chosen to reflect the duty of Australians to both nation and empire. The AIF was initially intended for service in Europe. Meanwhile, a separate 2,000-man force—known as the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF)—was formed for the task of capturing German New Guinea. In addition, small military forces were maintained in Australia to defend the country from attack.

Upon formation, the AIF consisted of only one infantry division, the 1st Division, and the 1st Light Horse Brigade. The 1st Division was made up of the 1st Infantry Brigade under Colonel Henry MacLaurin, an Australian-born officer with previous part-time military service; the 2nd, under Colonel James Whiteside McCay, an Irish-born Australian politician and former Minister for Defence; and the 3rd, under Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, a British regular officer seconded to the Australian Army before the war. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was commanded by Colonel Harry Chauvel, an Australian regular, while the divisional artillery was commanded by Colonel Talbot Hobbs. The initial response for recruits was so good that in September 1914 the decision was made to raise the 4th Infantry Brigade and 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades. The 4th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Colonel John Monash, a prominent Melbourne civil engineer and businessman. The AIF continued to grow through the war, eventually numbering five infantry divisions, two mounted divisions and a mixture of other units. As the AIF operated within the British war effort, its units were generally organised along the same lines as comparable British Army formations. However, there were often small differences between the structures of British and Australian units, especially in regards to the AIF infantry divisions&#x27; support units.

Hastily deployed, the first contingent of the AIF was essentially untrained and suffered from widespread equipment shortages. In early 1915 the AIF was largely an inexperienced force, with only a small percentage of its members having previous combat experience. However, many officers and non-commissioned personnel (NCOs) had previously served in the pre-war permanent or part-time forces, and a significant proportion of the enlisted personnel had received some basic military instruction as part of Australia&#x27;s compulsory training scheme. Predominantly a fighting force based on infantry battalions and light horse regiments—the high proportion of close combat troops to support personnel (e.g. medical, administrative, logistic, etc.) was exceeded only by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF)—this fact at least partially accounted for the high percentage of casualties it later sustained. Nevertheless, the AIF eventually included a large number of logistics and administrative units which were capable of meeting most of the force&#x27;s needs, and in some circumstances provided support to nearby allied units. However, the AIF mainly relied on the British Army for medium and heavy artillery support and other weapons systems necessary for combined arms warfare that were developed later in the war, including aircraft and tanks.

==Organisation==

===Command===

When originally formed in 1914 the AIF was commanded by Bridges, who also commanded the 1st Division. After Bridges&#x27; death at Gallipoli in May 1915, the Australian government appointed Major General James Gordon Legge, a Boer War veteran, to replace Bridges in command of both. However, British Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, the commander of British Troops in Egypt, objected to Legge bypassing him and communicating directly with Australia. The Australian government failed to support Legge, who thereafter deferred to Lieutenant General William Birdwood, the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. When Legge was sent to Egypt to command the 2nd Division, Birdwood made representations to the Australian government that Legge could not act as commander of the AIF, and that the Australian government should transfer Bridges&#x27; authority to him. This was done on a temporary basis on 18 September 1915. Promoted to major general, Chauvel took over command of the 1st Division in November when Major General Harold Walker was wounded, becoming the first Australian-born officer to command a division. When Birdwood became commander of the Dardanelles Army, command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps and the AIF passed to another British officer, Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, the commander of the NZEF, but Birdwood resumed command of the AIF when he assumed command of II ANZAC Corps upon its formation in Egypt in early 1916. I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps swapped designations on 28 March 1916. During early 1916 the Australian and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand governments sought the establishment of an Australian and New Zealand Army led by Birdwood which would have included all of the AIF&#x27;s infantry divisions and the New Zealand Division. However, General Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Empire forces in France, rejected this proposal on the grounds that the size of these forces was too small to justify grouping them in a field army.

Birdwood was officially confirmed as commander of the AIF on 14 September 1916, backdated to 18 September 1915, while also commanding I ANZAC Corps on the Western Front. He retained overall responsibility for the AIF units in the Middle East, but in practice this fell to Godley, and after II ANZAC Corps left Egypt as well, to Chauvel who also commanded the ANZAC Mounted Division. Later promoted to lieutenant general, he subsequently commanded the Desert Mounted Corps of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force; the first Australian to command a corps. Birdwood was later given command of the Australian Corps on its formation in November 1917. Another Australian, Monash, by then a lieutenant general, took over command of the corps on 31 May 1918. Despite being promoted to command the British Fifth Army, Birdwood retained command of the AIF. By this time four of the five divisional commanders were Australian officers. The exception was Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, the commander of the 4th Division, who was a British Army officer seconded to the Australian Army before the war, and who had joined the AIF in Australia in August 1914. The vast majority of brigade commands were also held by Australian officers. A number of British staff officers were attached to the headquarters of the Australian Corps, and its predecessors, due to a shortage of suitably trained Australian officers.

===Structure===
====Infantry divisions====
The organisation of the AIF closely followed the British Army divisional structure, and remained relatively unchanged throughout the war. During the war, the following infantry divisions were raised as part of the AIF:
* 1st Division
* 2nd Division
* 3rd Division
* 4th Division
* 5th Division
* 6th Division (broken up in 1917 before seeing combat)
* New Zealand and Australian Division (1915)

Each division comprised three infantry brigades, and each brigade contained four battalions (later reduced to three in 1918). Australian battalions initially included eight rifle companies; however, this was reduced to four expanded companies in January 1915 to conform with the organisation of British infantry battalions. A battalion contained about 1,000 men. Although the divisional structure evolved over the course of the war, each formation also included a range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and administrative units. By 1918 each brigade also included a light trench mortar battery, while each division included a pioneer battalion, a machine-gun battalion, two field artillery brigades, a divisional trench mortar brigade, four companies of engineers, a divisional signals company, a divisional train consisting of four service corps companies, a salvage company, three field ambulances, a sanitary section and a mobile veterinary section. These changes were reflective of wider organisational adaption, tactical innovation, and the adoption of new weapons and technology that occurred throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).

At the start of the Gallipoli Campaign, the AIF had four infantry brigades with the first three making up the 1st Division. The 4th Brigade was joined with the sole New Zealand infantry brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division. The 2nd Division had been formed in Egypt in 1915 and was sent to Gallipoli in August to reinforce the 1st Division, doing so without its artillery and having only partially completed its training. After Gallipoli, the infantry underwent a major expansion. The 3rd Division was formed in Australia and completed its training in the UK before moving to France. The New Zealand and Australian Division was broken up with the New Zealand elements forming the New Zealand Division, while the original Australian infantry brigades (1st to 4th) were split in half to create 16 new battalions to form another four brigades. These new brigades (12th to 15th) were used to form the 4th and 5th Divisions. This ensured the battalions of the two new divisions had a core of experienced soldiers. The 6th Division commenced forming in England in February 1917, but was never deployed to France and was broken up in September of that year to provide reinforcements to the other five divisions.

The Australian infantry did not have regiments in the British sense, only battalions identified by ordinal number (1st to 60th). Each battalion originated from a geographical region, with men recruited from that area. New South Wales and Victoria, the most populous states, filled their own battalions (and even whole brigades) while the &quot;Outer States&quot;—Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania—often combined to assemble a battalion. These regional associations remained throughout the war and each battalion developed its own strong regimental identity. The pioneer battalions (1st to 5th, formed from March 1916) were also mostly recruited regionally; however, the machine-gun battalions (1st to 5th, formed from March 1918 from the brigade and divisional machine-gun companies) were made up of personnel from all states.

During the manpower crisis following the Third Battle of Ypres, in which the five divisions sustained 38,000 casualties, there were plans to follow the British reorganisation and reduce all brigades from four battalions to three. In the British regimental system this was traumatic enough; however, the regimental identity survived the disbanding of a single battalion. In the Australian system, disbanding a battalion meant the extinction of the unit. In September 1918, the decision to disband seven battalions—the 19th, 21st, 25th, 37th, 42nd, 54th and 60th—led to a series of &quot;mutinies over disbandment&quot; where the ranks refused to report to their new battalions. In the AIF, mutiny was one of two charges that carried the death penalty, the other being desertion to the enemy. Instead of being charged with mutiny, the instigators were charged as being absent without leave (AWOL) and the doomed battalions were eventually permitted to remain together for the forthcoming battle, following which the survivors voluntarily disbanded. These mutinies were motivated mainly by the soldiers&#x27; loyalty to their battalions.

The artillery underwent a significant expansion during the war. When the 1st Division embarked in November 1914 it did so with its 18-pounder field guns, but Australia had not been able to provide the division with the howitzer batteries or the heavy guns that would otherwise have been included on its establishment, due to a lack of equipment. These shortages were unable to be rectified prior to the landing at Gallipoli where the howitzers would have provided the plunging and high-angled fire that was required due to the rough terrain at Anzac Cove. When the 2nd Division was formed in July 1915 it did so without its complement of artillery. Meanwhile, in December 1915 when the government offered to form another division it did so on the basis that its artillery would be provided by Britain. In time though these shortfalls were overcome, with the Australian field artillery expanding from just three field brigades in 1914 to twenty at the end of 1917. The majority of the heavy artillery units supporting the Australian divisions were British, although two Australian heavy batteries were raised from the regular Australian Garrison Artillery. These were the 54th Siege Battery, which was equipped with 8-inch howitzers, and the 55th with 9.2-inch howitzers.

====Mounted divisions====

The following mounted divisions were raised as part of the AIF:
* ANZAC Mounted Division
* Australian Mounted Division

During the Gallipoli Campaign four light horse brigades had been dismounted and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division was formed in Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand – the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades. A light horse brigade consisted of three regiments. Each regiment included three squadrons of four troops and a machine-gun section. The initial strength of a regiment was around 500 men, although its establishment changed throughout the war. In 1916, the machine-gun sections of each regiment were concentrated as squadrons at brigade-level. Like the infantry, the light horse regiments were raised on a territorial basis by state and were identified numerically (1st to 15th).

====Corps====
The following corps-level formations were raised:
* Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
* I ANZAC Corps
* II ANZAC Corps
* Australian Corps
* Desert Mounted Corps (formerly the Desert Column)
The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was formed from the AIF and NZEF in preparation for the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 and was commanded by Birdwood. Initially the corps consisted of the 1st Australian Division, the New Zealand and Australian Division, and two mounted brigades—the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade—although when first deployed to Gallipoli in April, it did so without its mounted formations, as the terrain was considered unsuitable. However, in May, both brigades were dismounted and deployed along with the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades as reinforcements. Later, as the campaign continued the corps was reinforced further by the 2nd Australian Division, which began arriving from August 1915. In February 1916, it was reorganised into I and II ANZAC Corps in Egypt following the evacuation from Gallipoli and the subsequent expansion of the AIF.

I ANZAC Corps included the Australian 1st and 2nd Divisions and the New Zealand Division. The New Zealand Division was later transferred to the II ANZAC Corps in July 1916 and was replaced by the Australian 3rd Division in I ANZAC. Initially employed in Egypt as part of the defence of the Suez Canal, it was transferred to the Western Front in March 1916. II ANZAC Corps included the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions, forming in Egypt it transferred to France in July 1916. In November 1917 the five Australian divisions of I and II ANZAC Corps merged to become the Australian Corps, while the British and New Zealand elements in each corps became the British XXII Corps. The Australian Corps was the largest corps fielded by the British Empire in France, providing just over 10 percent of the manning of the BEF. At its peak it numbered 109,881 men. Corps troops raised included the 13th Light Horse Regiment and three army artillery brigades. Each corps also included a cyclist battalion.

Meanwhile, the majority of the Australian Light Horse had remained in the Middle East and subsequently served in Egypt, Sinai, Palestine and Syria with the Desert Column of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In August 1917 the column was expanded to become the Desert Mounted Corps, which consisted of the ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (which included a number of Australian, British and New Zealand camel companies). In contrast to the static trench warfare that developed in Europe, the troops in the Middle East mostly experienced a more fluid form of warfare involving manoeuvre and combined arms tactics.

====Australian Flying Corps====
The 1st AIF included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). Soon after the outbreak of war in 1914, two aircraft were sent to assist in capturing German colonies in what is now north-east New Guinea. However, these colonies surrendered quickly, before the planes were even unpacked. The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in protecting British oil interests in what is now Iraq. The corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of World War I. By the end of the war, four squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4—had seen operational service, while another four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8—had also been established. A total of 460 officers and 2,234 other ranks served in the AFC. The AFC remained part of the Australian Army until 1919, when it was disbanded; later forming the basis of the Royal Australian Air Force.

====Specialist units====
A number of specialist units were also raised, including three Australian tunnelling companies. Arriving on the Western Front in May 1916 they undertook mining and counter-mining operations alongside British, Canadian and New Zealand companies, initially operating around Armentieres and at Fromelles. The following year they operated in the Ypres section. In November 1916, the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took over from the Canadians around Hill 60, subsequently playing a key role in the Battle of Messines in June 1917. During the German offensive in March 1918 the three companies served as infantry, and later supported the Allied advance being used to defuse booby traps and mines. The Australian Electrical Mining and Mechanical Boring Company supplied electric power to units in the British Second Army area.

Motor transport units were also formed. Not required at Gallipoli, they were sent on to the Western Front, becoming the first units of the AIF to serve there. The motor transport rejoined I ANZAC Corps when it reached the Western Front in 1916. Australia also formed six railway operating companies, which served on the Western Front. Specialist ordnance units included ammunition and mobile workshops units formed late in the war, while service units included supply columns, ammunition sub-parks, field bakeries and butcheries, and depot units. Hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units were also formed in Australia and overseas, as were a number of convalescent depots.
One small armoured unit was raised, the 1st Armoured Car Section. Formed in Australia, it fought in the Western Desert, and then, re-equipped with T Model Fords, served in Palestine as the 1st Light Car Patrol. Camel companies were raised in Egypt to patrol the Western Desert. They formed part of the Imperial Camel Corps and fought in the Sinai and Palestine. In 1918 they were converted to light horse as the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments.

===Administration===
Although operationally placed at the disposal of the British, the AIF was administered as a separate national force, with the Australian government reserving the responsibility for the promotion, pay, clothing, equipment and feeding of its personnel. The AIF was administered separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a parallel system was set up to deal with non-operational matters including record-keeping, finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London. Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury. The AIF Headquarters and its subordinate units were almost entirely independent from the British Army, which allowed the force to be self-sustaining in many fields. The AIF generally followed British administrative policy and procedures, including for the awarding of imperial honours and awards.

==Weaponry and equipment==

The weaponry and equipment of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that used by the British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. During the war the equipment used changed as tactics evolved, and generally followed British developments. The standard issued rifle was the .303-inch Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mark III (SMLE). Infantrymen used 1908-pattern webbing, while light horsemen used leather bandoliers and load carriage equipment. A large pack was issued as part of marching order. In 1915 infantrymen were issued with the SMLE and long sword bayonet, while periscope rifles were also used. From 1916 they also used manufactured hand grenades and rodded rifle grenades, both of which had been in short supply at Gallipoli (necessitating the use of improvised &quot;jam-tin&quot; grenades). A grenade discharge cup was issued for fitting to the muzzle of a rifle for the projection of the Mills bomb from 1917. Machine-guns initially included a small number of Maxim or Vickers medium machine-guns, but subsequently also included the Lewis light machine-gun, the latter two of which were issued in greater numbers as the war continued so as to increase the firepower available to the infantry in response to the tactical problems of trench warfare. Light horse units underwent a similar process, although were issued Hotchkiss guns to replace their Lewis guns in early 1917.

From 1916 the Stokes light trench mortar was issued to infantry to replace a range of trench catapults and smaller trench mortars, whilst it was also used in a battery at brigade-level to provide organic indirect fire support. In addition, individual soldiers often used a range of personal weapons including knives, clubs, knuckle-dusters, revolvers and pistols. Snipers on the Western Front used Pattern 1914 Enfield sniper rifles with telescopic sights. Light horsemen also carried bayonets (as they were initially considered mounted infantry), although the Australian Mounted Division adopted cavalry swords in late 1917. Artillery included 18-pounders which equipped the field batteries, 4.5-inch howitzers used by the howitzer batteries, and 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers which equipped the heavy (siege) batteries. The 9.45-inch heavy mortar equipped a heavy trench mortar battery, while medium trench mortar batteries were equipped with the 2-inch medium mortar, and later the 6-inch mortar. Light Horse units were supported by British and Indian artillery. The main mount used by the light horse was the Waler, while draught horses were used by the artillery and for wheeled transport. Camels were also used, both as mounts and transport, and donkeys and mules were used as pack animals.

==Personnel==

===Recruitment===

Enlisted under the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot;, the AIF was an all volunteer force for the duration of the war. Australia was one of only two belligerents on either side not to introduce conscription during the war (along with South Africa). Although a system of compulsory training had been introduced in 1911 for home service, under Australian law it did not extend to overseas service. In Australia, two plebiscites on using conscription to expand the AIF were defeated in October 1916 and December 1917, thereby preserving the volunteer status but stretching the AIF&#x27;s reserves towards the end of the war. A total of 416,809 men enlisted in the Army during the war, representing 38.7 percent of the white male population aged between 18 and 44. Of these, 331,781 men were sent overseas to serve as part of the AIF. Approximately 18 percent of those who served in the AIF had been born in the United Kingdom, marginally more than their proportion of the Australian population, although almost all enlistments occurred in Australia, with only 57 people being recruited from overseas. Indigenous Australians were officially barred from the AIF until October 1917, when the restrictions were altered to allow so-called &quot;half-castes&quot; to join. Estimates of the number of Indigenous Australians who served in the AIF differ considerably, but are believed to be over 500. More than 2,000 women served with the AIF, mainly in the Australian Army Nursing Service.

The recruitment process was managed by the various military districts. At the outset it had been planned to recruit half the AIF&#x27;s initial commitment of 20,000 personnel from Australia&#x27;s part-time forces, and volunteers were initially recruited from within designated regimental areas, thus creating a linkage between the units of the AIF and the units of the home service Militia. In the early stages of mobilisation the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 percent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. To enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least , with a chest measurement of at least . Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that of the 32,000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7,000 would survive to the end of the war.

By the end of 1914 around 53,000 volunteers had been accepted, allowing a second contingent to depart in December. Meanwhile, reinforcements were sent at a rate of 3,200 men per month. The landing at Anzac Cove subsequently resulted in a significant increase in enlistments, with 36,575 men being recruited in July 1915. Although this level was never again reached, enlistments remained high in late 1915 and early 1916. From then a gradual decline occurred, and whereas news from Gallipoli had increased recruitment, the fighting at Fromelles and Pozieres did not have a similar effect, with monthly totals dropping from 10,656 in May 1916 to around 6,000 between June and August. Significant losses in mid-1916, coupled with the failure of the volunteer system to provide sufficient replacements, resulted in the first referendum on conscription, which was defeated by a narrow margin. Although there was an increase in enlistments in September (9,325) and October (11,520), in December they fell to the lowest total of the year (2,617). Enlistments in 1917 never exceeded 4,989 (in March). Heavy losses at Passchendaele resulted in a second referendum on conscription, which was defeated by an even greater margin. Recruitment continued to decline, reaching a low in December (2,247). Monthly intakes fell further in early 1918, but peaked in May (4,888) and remained relatively steady albeit reduced from previous periods, before slightly increasing in October (3,619) prior to the armistice in November.

Ultimately, the voluntary system of recruitment proved unable to sustain the force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded towards the end of the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.

===Pay===
Soldiers of the AIF were among the highest paid of the war. The pay for a private was set at five shillings a day, while an additional shilling was deferred to be paid on discharge. As a result, the AIF earned the sobriquet &quot;six bob a day tourists&quot;. Married men were required to allot two shillings a day for their dependents; however, a separation allowance was added in 1915. Reflecting the progressive nature of Australian industrial and social policy of the era, this rate of pay was intended to be equal to that of the average worker (after including rations and accommodation) and higher than that of soldiers in the Militia. In contrast, New Zealand soldiers received five shillings, while British infantrymen were initially only paid one shilling, although this was later increased to three. Junior officers in the AIF were also paid at a rate higher than those in the British Army, although senior officers were paid considerably less than their counterparts.

===Training===
In the early stages of the AIF&#x27;s formation, prior to Gallipoli, training was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level. There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. Camps were established in every state including at Enoggera (Queensland), Liverpool (New South Wales), Broadmeadows (Victoria), Brighton (Tasmania), Morphettville (South Australia) and Blackboy Hill (Western Australia). In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others—such as the 5th Battalion—spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still quite rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and they lacked realism, meaning that commanders did not benefit from handling their troops under battlefield conditions.

Some soldiers had received training through the compulsory training scheme that had been established in 1911, while others had served as volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or as members of the British Army, but their numbers were limited and in many cases the quality of the training they had received was also limited. The original intention had been that half the initial intake would consist of soldiers that were currently serving in the Militia, but ultimately this did not come to fruition and while about 8,000 of the original intake had some prior military experience, either through compulsory training or as volunteers, over 6,000 had none at all. In terms of officers, the situation was better. For example, within the 1st Division, of its initial 631 officers, 607 had had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early in order for them to join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. As a result, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had risen from the ranks. While the AIF&#x27;s initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had any substantial experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli campaign.

After the AIF was transferred to the European battlefield, the training system was greatly improved. Efforts were made at standardisation, with a formal training organisation and curriculum—consisting of 14 weeks basic training for infantrymen—being established. In Egypt, as the AIF was expanded in early 1916, each brigade established a training battalion. These formations were later sent to the United Kingdom and were absorbed into a large system of depots that was established on Salisbury Plain by each branch of the AIF including infantry, engineers, artillery, signals, medical and logistics. After completing their initial instruction at depots in Australia and the United Kingdom, soldiers were posted to in-theatre base depots where they received advanced training before being posted as reinforcements to operational units. Like the British Army, the AIF sought to rapidly pass on &quot;lessons learned&quot; as the war progressed, and these were widely transmitted through regularly updated training documents. The experience gained through combat also improved the skills of the surviving officers and men, and by 1918 the AIF was a very well trained and well led force. After coming to terms with the conditions on the Western Front the Australians had played a part in the development of new combined arms tactics for offensive operations that occurred within the BEF, while in defence they employed patrolling, trench raids, and Peaceful Penetration tactics to dominate no man&#x27;s land.

Following the deployment of the AIF a reinforcement system was used to replace wastage. Reinforcements received training in Australia first at camps around the country before sailing as drafts—consisting of about two officers and between 100 and 150 other ranks—and joining their assigned units at the front. Initially, these drafts were assigned to specific units prior to departure and were recruited from the same area as the unit they were assigned to, but later in the war drafts were sent as &quot;general reinforcements&quot;, which could be assigned to any unit as required. These drafts were despatched even before Gallipoli and continued until late 1917 to early 1918. Some units had as many as 26 or 27 reinforcement drafts. To provide officer reinforcements, a series of AIF officer schools, such as that at Broadmeadows, were established in Australia before officer training was eventually concentrated at a school near Duntroon. These schools produced a large number of officers, but they were eventually closed in 1917 due to concerns that their graduates were too inexperienced. After this most replacement officers were drawn from the ranks of the AIF&#x27;s deployed units, and candidates attended either British officer training units, or in-theatre schools established in France. After February 1916, the issue of NCO training was also taken more seriously, and several schools were established, with training initially being two weeks in duration before being increased to two months.

===Discipline===
During the war the AIF gained a reputation, at least amongst British officers, for indifference to military authority and indiscipline when away from the battlefield on leave. This included a reputation for refusing to salute officers, sloppy dress, lack of respect for military rank and drunkenness on leave. Historian Peter Stanley has written that &quot;the AIF was, paradoxically, both a cohesive and remarkably effective force, but also one whose members could not be relied upon to accept military discipline or to even remain in action&quot;.

Indiscipline, misbehaviour, and public drunkenness were reportedly widespread in Egypt in 1914–15, while a number of AIF personnel were also involved in several civil disturbances or riots in the red-light district of Cairo during this period. Australians also appear to have been over-represented among British Empire personnel convicted by court martial of various disciplinary offences on the Western Front from 1916, especially absence without leave. This may be partially explained by the refusal of the Australian government to follow the British Army practice of applying the death penalty to desertion, unlike New Zealand or Canada, as well as to the high proportion of front-line personnel in the AIF. Australian soldiers received prison sentences, including hard labour and life imprisonment, for desertion as well as for other serious offences, including manslaughter, assault and theft. More minor offences included drunkenness and defiance of authority. There were also examples of Australian soldiers being involved in looting, while the practice of &quot;scrounging&quot; or &quot;souveniring&quot; was also widespread.

The stresses from prolonged combat contributed to a high incidence of indiscipline within AIF units, and especially those in France during the heavy fighting between April and October 1918. The rates of personnel going absent without leave or deserting increased during 1918, and it became rare for soldiers to salute their officers in many units. Following the war, the indiscipline within the AIF was often portrayed as harmless larrikinism.

Australia&#x27;s working class culture also influenced that of the AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers were members of the working class, with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied their attitudes to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual or perceived mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part in during their pre-enlistment employment, with the men not seeing themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict military culture than was common in the British Army.

==Uniforms and insignia==

The pre-war Australian Army uniform formed the basis of that worn by the AIF, which adopted the broad-brimmed slouch hat and rising sun badge. Peak caps were initially also worn by the infantry, while light horsemen often wore a distinctive emu plume in their slouch hats. A standard khaki was worn by all arms. From 1916 steel helmets and gas masks were issued for use by infantry on the Western Front. A loose-fitting four-pocket service dress jacket was worn, along with baggy knee breeches, puttees, and tan ankle-boots. A heavy woollen greatcoat was worn during cold weather. The uniform was a drab &quot;pea soup&quot; or khaki colour, while all buttons and badges were oxidised to prevent shine. All personnel wore a shoulder title bearing the word &quot;Australia&quot;. Rank insignia followed the British Army pattern and were worn on the upper arms (or shoulders for officers). Identical hat and collar badges were worn by all units, which were initially only distinguished by small metal numerals and letters on the shoulder straps (or collars for officers). However, in 1915 a system of unit colour patches was adopted, worn on the upper arm of a soldier&#x27;s jacket. Wound stripes of gold braid were also authorised to be worn to denote each wound received. Other distinguishing badges included a brass letter &quot;A&quot; which was worn on the colour patch by men and nurses who had served at Gallipoli, blue chevrons representing each year of overseas service, and a red chevron to represent enlistment during the first year of the war. Uniforms worn by the AFC were similar to those of the rest of the AIF, although some officers wore the double-breasted &quot;maternity jacket&quot; which had been worn at the pre-war Central Flying School. AFC &quot;wings&quot; were worn on the left breast, while an AFC colour patch and standard rising sun badges were also worn.

==Operations==
===Gallipoli===
The first contingent of the AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Fremantle, Western Australia and Albany on 1 November 1914. Although they were originally bound for England to undergo further training prior to employment on the Western Front, the Australians were subsequently sent to British-controlled Egypt to pre-empt any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers. Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and shortly after the landing a bloody stalemate developed. This ultimately lasted eight months before Allied commanders decided to evacuate the troops without having achieved the campaign&#x27;s objectives. Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.

===Egypt and Palestine===
After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In 1916, the infantry began to move to France while the mounted infantry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the ANZAC Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australians first saw combat during the Senussi Uprising in the Libyan Desert and the Nile Valley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro-Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The ANZAC Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani between 3 and 5 August 1916 against the Turks who were eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai, although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February.
The advance entered Palestine and an initial, unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917, while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April. A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the ANZAC Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part. The battle was a complete success for the British, over-running the Gaza–Beersheba line and capturing 12,000 Turkish soldiers. The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day, after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than . The Turkish trenches were overrun, with the Australians capturing the wells at Beersheba and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded. Later, Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at Mughar Ridge, Jerusalem and the Megiddo. The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918. Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality, although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process. Total Australian battle casualties in the campaign were 4,851, including 1,374 dead.

===Western Front===
Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March 1916. I ANZAC Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of Armentières on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front, earning a formidable reputation. Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed. The 5th Division, positioned on the left flank, was the first in action during the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916, suffering 5,533 casualties in a single day. The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July, assaulting Pozières, and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July, they had suffered 5,286 casualties. Mouquet Farm was attacked in August, with casualties totalling 6,300 men. By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to reorganise, they had suffered 23,000 casualties in just 45 days.

In March 1917, the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line, capturing the town of Bapaume. On 11 April, the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of Bullecourt, losing over 3,000 casualties and 1,170 captured. On 15 April, the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter-attacked near Lagnicourt and were forced to abandon the town, before recapturing it. The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, beginning on 3 May, and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division. Finally, on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st, remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid-May. Combined, these efforts cost 7,482 Australian casualties.

On 7 June 1917, II ANZAC Corps—along with two British corps—launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres. The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds (454,545 kg) of explosives that had been placed underneath the Messines ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of Messines included nearly 6,800 men. I ANZAC Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau, between September and November 1917. Individual actions took place at Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks of fighting the Australians suffered 38,000 casualties.

On 21 March 1918, the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last-ditched effort to win the war, unleashing 63 divisions over a front. As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme. The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide. By late May the Germans had pushed to within of Paris. During this time the Australians fought at Dernancourt, Morlancourt, Villers-Bretonneux, Hangard Wood, Hazebrouck, and Hamel. At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps, Monash, successfully used combined arms—including aircraft, artillery and armour—in an attack for the first time.

The German offensive ground to a halt in mid-July and a brief lull followed, during which the Australians undertook a series of raids, known as Peaceful Penetrations. The Allies soon launched their own offensive—the Hundred Days Offensive—ultimately ending the war. Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens. Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel, significant gains were made on what became known as the &quot;Black Day&quot; of the German Army. The offensive continued for four months, and during the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. While these actions were successful, the Australian divisions suffered considerable casualties and by September 1918 the average strength of their infantry battalions was between 300 and 400, which was less than 50 percent of the authorised strength. The AIF was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation following the engagement at Montbrehain; at this time the Australian Corps appeared to be close to breaking as a result of its heavy casualties since August. The Corps was still out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. However, some artillery units continued to support British and American units into November, and the AFC maintained flying operations until the end of the war. Total Australian casualties on the Western Front numbered 181,000, including 46,000 of whom died. Another 114,000 men were wounded, 16,000 gassed, and approximately 3,850 were taken prisoners of war.

===Other theatres===
Small numbers of AIF personnel also served in other theatres. Australian troops from the 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron provided communications for British forces during the Mesopotamian Campaign. They participated in a number of battles, including the Battle of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Ramadi in September that year. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia open to the Turkish Army. A special force, known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Dunsterville, was formed from hand-picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. Some 20 Australian officers served with Dunsterforce in the Caucasus Campaign and one party under Captain Stanley Savige was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. Australian nurses staffed four British hospitals in Salonika, and another 10 in India.

==Disbandment==
By the end of the war the AIF had gained a reputation as a well-trained and highly effective military force, enduring more than two years of costly fighting on the Western Front before playing a significant role in the final Allied victory in 1918, albeit as a smaller part of the wider British Empire war effort. Like the other Dominion divisions from Canada and New Zealand, the Australians were viewed as being among the best of the British forces in France, and were often used to spearhead operations. 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross. This reputation came at a heavy cost, with the AIF sustaining approximately 210,000 casualties, of which 61,519 were killed or died of wounds. This represented a total casualty rate of 64.8 percent, which was among the highest of any belligerent for the war. About another 4,000 men were captured. The majority of casualties occurred among the infantry (which sustained a casualty rate of 79 percent); however, the artillery (58 percent) and light horse (32 percent) also incurred significant losses.

After the war, all AIF units went into camp and began the process of demobilisation. The AIF&#x27;s involvement in the occupation of former German or Turkish territory was limited as Prime Minister William Hughes requested their early repatriation. The exceptions were No. 4 Squadron, AFC and the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station, which participated in the occupation of the Rhineland. The 7th Light Horse Regiment was also sent to occupy the Gallipoli peninsula for six weeks, along with a New Zealand regiment. At the time of the armistice, there were 95,951 soldiers in France and a further 58,365 in England, 17,255 in the Middle East plus nurses in Salonika and India, all to be transported home. Around 120 Australians decided to delay their departure and instead joined the British Army, serving in Northern Russia during the Russian Civil War, although officially the Australian government refused to contribute forces to the campaign.

By May 1919, the last troops were out of France, and 70,000 were encamped on Salisbury Plain. The men returned home on a &quot;first come, first go&quot; basis, with the process overseen by Monash in Britain and Chauvel in Cairo. Many of the soldiers undertook government-funded training in civilian occupations while awaiting repatriation to Australia. Only 10,000 Australian soldiers remained in England by September. Monash, the senior Australian commander, was repatriated on 26 December 1919. The last transport organised to repatriate troops was H.T. &quot;Naldera&quot;, which departed London on 13 April 1920. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921, and on 1 July 1921 the military hospitals in Australia passed into civilian hands. As a volunteer force, all units were demobilised at the end of the war. Australia&#x27;s part-time military force, the Citizens Force, was subsequently reorganised to replicate the AIF&#x27;s divisional structure and the numerical designations of many of its units to perpetuate their identities and battle honours.

==Legacy==
During and after the war, the AIF was often portrayed in glowing terms. As part of the &quot;Anzac legend&quot;, the soldiers were depicted as good humoured and egalitarian men who had little time for the formalities of military life or strict discipline, yet fought fiercely and skilfully in battle. Australian soldiers was also seen as resourceful and self-reliant. The wartime official correspondent and post-war official historian C.E.W. Bean was central to the development of this stereotype. Bean believed that the character and achievements of the AIF reflected the unique nature of rural Australians, and frequently exaggerated the democratic nature of the force and the proportion of soldiers from rural areas in his journalism and the &quot;Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918&quot;. The perceived qualities of the AIF were seen as being unique, as the product of the harsh Australian environment, the ethos of the bush and egalitarianism. Such notions built on the concept of men from the bush being excellent natural soldiers which was prevalent in Australian culture before the war. The achievements of the AIF, especially during the Gallipoli campaign, were also frequently portrayed by Bean and others as having marked the birth of Australia as a nation. Moreover, the AIF&#x27;s performance was often seen as proof that the character of Australians had passed the test of war.

The exploits of the AIF at Gallipoli, and then on the Western Front, subsequently became central to the national mythology. In the years that followed much was made of ethos of the AIF, including its volunteer status and the quality of &quot;mateship&quot;. Yet many of the factors which had resulted in the AIF&#x27;s success as a military formation were not exclusively Australian, with most modern armies recognising the importance of small-unit identity and group cohesion in maintaining morale. Many of the qualities that arguably defined the Australian soldier were also claimed by New Zealanders and Canadians as having been exhibited by their soldiers, whilst undoubtedly soldiers of the German, British and American armies also exhibited such traits, even if they were known by different terms. Objectively, the foundations of the AIF&#x27;s performance were more likely to have been military professionalism based on &quot;discipline, training, leadership, and sound doctrine&quot;. While the volunteer status of the AIF has been seen by some to explain its military performance, it was by no means unique in this regard. The status of their enlistment made little difference against the artillery, machine-gun fire, and wire obstacles of modern industrial warfare at any rate. Equally, individual skill and morale proved to be less important than sound tactics, with effective fire and movement ultimately making the difference in 1918. The Australians were not alone among the Allied armies in embracing such tactical innovations, while many of the new technologies and integrated weapon systems they relied upon were provided by the British Army.
Commemorating and celebrating the AIF became an entrenched tradition following World War I, with Anzac Day forming the centrepiece of remembrance of the war. The soldiers who served in the AIF, known colloquially as &quot;Diggers&quot;, in time became &quot;...one of the paramount Australian archetypes.&quot; When the Second Australian Imperial Force was raised in 1939 following the outbreak of World War II it was seen as inheriting the name and traditions of its predecessor. Perceptions of the AIF have evolved over time. During the 1950s and 1960s social critics began to associate the &quot;Anzac legend&quot; with complacency and conformism, and popular discontent concerning the Vietnam War and conscription from the mid-1960s led many people to reject it. Historians also increasingly questioned Bean&#x27;s views concerning the AIF, leading to more realistic and nuanced assessments of the force. However, some historians continue to stress the AIF&#x27;s achievements, and state that it was representative of Australia. The &quot;Anzac legend&quot; grew in popularity during the 1980s and 1990s when it was adopted as part of a new Australian nationalism, with the AIF often being portrayed as a uniquely Australian force that fought in other people&#x27;s wars and was sacrificed by the British military in campaigns which were of little importance to Australia. This depiction is controversial, however, and has been rejected by some historians. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History&quot; judges that while it is unclear how popular perceptions of Australia&#x27;s military history will evolve, &quot;it is clear that the Anzac legend will remain an important national myth for some time to come&quot;.

<doc id="415476" wikidata="Q57206" url="?curid=415476" title="Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria">
<text>Maximilian I (17 April 157327 September 1651), occasionally called the Great, a member of the House of Wittelsbach, ruled as Duke of Bavaria from 1597. His reign was marked by the Thirty Years&#x27; War during which he obtained the title of a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire at the 1623 Diet of Regensburg.

Maximilian was a capable monarch who, by overcoming the feudal rights of the local estates (&quot;Landstände&quot;), laid the foundations for absolutist rule in Bavaria. A devout Catholic, he was one of the leading proponents of the Counter-Reformation and founder of the Catholic League of Imperial Princes. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War, he was able to conquer the Upper Palatinate region, as well as the Electoral Palatinate affiliated with the electoral dignity of his Wittelsbach cousin, the &quot;Winter King&quot; Frederick V. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia affirmed his possession of Upper Palatinate and the hereditary electoral title, though it returned the Electoral Palatinate to Frederick&#x27;s heir and created an eighth electoral dignity for them.

==Background==

Maximilian I was born in Munich, the eldest son of William V, Duke of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine to survive infancy. He was educated by the Jesuits, and following his father&#x27;s increasing difficulties in ruling the country, began to take part in the government round 1591, but latest 1594. In 1595 he married his cousin, Elisabeth Renata (also known as Elizabeth of Lorraine), daughter of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, and became Duke of Bavaria upon his father&#x27;s abdication in 1597.

His first marriage to Elisabeth Renata was childless. A few months after the death of Elisabeth Renata, Maximilian married, on 15 July 1635 in Vienna, his 25-year-old niece Maria Anna of Austria (1610–1665), the daughter of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maximilian&#x27;s sister, Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574–1616). The main motivation for this swift remarriage was not so much political grounds as the hope of producing a prince to inherit. In contrast to the Elector&#x27;s first wife, Maria Anna was very interested in politics and well instructed about developments. She was not bound to the Habsburgs, but rather completely advocated the Bavarian standpoint. Additionally, she conducted lively exchanges of opinion with high officials of the Munich court and took part in meetings of the cabinet. By her he left two sons, Ferdinand Maria, who succeeded him, and Maximilian Philip.

As the ablest prince of his age he sought to prevent Germany from becoming the battleground of Europe, and although a rigid adherent of the Catholic faith, was not always subservient to the church. Weak in health and feeble in frame, Maximilian had high ambitions both for himself and his duchy, and was tenacious and resourceful in prosecuting his designs.

==German politics and the Thirty Years&#x27; War==
Maximilian refrained from any interference in German politics until 1607, when he was entrusted with the duty of executing the imperial ban against the free city of Donauwörth, a Protestant stronghold. In December 1607 his troops occupied the city, and vigorous steps were taken to restore the supremacy of Catholicism. Some Protestant princes, alarmed at this action, formed the Protestant Union to defend their interests, which was answered in 1609 by the establishment of the Catholic League, in the formation of which Maximilian took an important part. Under his leadership an army was set on foot, but his policy was strictly defensive and he refused to allow the League to become a tool in the hands of the House of Habsburg. Dissensions among his colleagues led the duke to resign his office in 1616, but the approach of trouble brought about his return to the League about two years later.

Having refused to become a candidate for the imperial throne in the 1619 imperial election, Maximilian was faced with the complications arising from the Bohemian Revolt. After some delay he made a treaty with Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in October 1619, and in return for large concessions placed the forces of the League at the emperor&#x27;s service. Anxious to curtail the area of the struggle, he made a treaty of neutrality with the Protestant Union, and occupied Upper Austria as security for the expenses of the campaign. On 8 November 1620 his troops under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly defeated the forces of Frederick, King of Bohemia and Count Palatine of the Rhine, at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague. Subsequently Ferdinand II released Upper Austria as a pawn for Maximilian until 1628.
In spite of the arrangement with the Union, Tilly then devastated the Rhenish Palatinate, and in February 1623 Maximilian was formally invested with the electoral dignity and the attendant office of Arch-Steward, which had been enjoyed since 1356 by the Counts Palatine of the Rhine. After receiving the Upper Palatinate and restoring Upper Austria to Ferdinand, Maximilian became leader of the party which sought to bring about Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s dismissal from the imperial service. At the Diet of Regensburg (1630) Ferdinand was compelled to assent to this demand, but the sequel was disastrous both for Bavaria and its ruler. Attempting to remain neutral during the war, Maximilian signed the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau (1631) with the Kingdom of France, but this proved worthless.

Early in 1632 Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden marched into the electorate and occupied Munich, and Maximilian could only obtain the assistance of the Imperial troops by placing himself under the orders of Wallenstein, now restored to the command of the emperor&#x27;s forces. The ravages of the Swedes and their French allies induced the elector to enter into negotiations for peace with the Swedes and Cardinal Richelieu of France. He also wooed the Protestants by proposing modifications to the Edict of Restitution of 1629, but these efforts were abortive.

In September 1638 Baron Franz von Mercy was made master-general of ordnance in the army of Bavaria, then the second largest army in the Holy Roman Empire. Mercy and Johann von Werth as lieutenant field-marshal fought with varying success France and Sweden.

In March 1647 Maximilian concluded the Truce of Ulm (1647) with France and Sweden, but the entreaties of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor led him to disregard his undertaking. Bavaria was again ravaged, and the elector&#x27;s forces were defeated in May 1648 at the Battle of Zusmarshausen. The Peace of Westphalia soon put an end to the struggle. By this treaty it was agreed that Maximilian would retain the electoral dignity, which was made hereditary in his family along with the Upper Palatinate. Maximilian had to give up the Lower Palatinate, which was restored to Charles Louis, Frederick V&#x27;s son and heir.

==Administrative and cultural activities==

Maximilian rehabilitated the Bavarian state finances, reorganised the Bavarian administration and army, and introduced mercantilist measures as well as a new corpus juris, the &quot;Codex Maximilianeus&quot;.
In 1610 Maximilian ordered to enlarge the Munich Residenz and to upgrade the Hofgarten. The original buildings of Schleissheim Palace were extended between 1617 and 1623 by Heinrich Schön and Hans Krumpper to the so-called &quot;Old Palace&quot;. Maximilian acquired numerous paintings of Albrecht Dürer, Peter Paul Rubens and additional artists for the Wittelsbach collection. In 1616 for example Maximilian I commissioned four hunt paintings from Peter Paul Rubens. He even obtained Dürer&#x27;s &quot;The Four Apostles&quot; in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers. Among his court artists were Peter Candid, Friedrich Sustris, Hubert Gerhard, Hans Krumpper, Adrian de Vries and Georg Petel.

The Duke died at Ingolstadt on 27 September 1651. He is buried in St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Munich. In 1839 a statue was erected to his memory at Munich by King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

== Family and children ==
On 6 February 1595, Maximilian married his first cousin princess Elisabeth (1574–1635), daughter of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine and Claudia of France, daughter of Henry II of France, in Nancy. They had no issue.

On 15 July 1635, Maximilian married his niece Maria Anna of Austria (1610–1665), daughter of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574–1616), in Vienna. They had two sons:

* Ferdinand Maria (1636–1679), who married in 1652 Henriette Adelaide of Savoy (1636–1676)
* Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus, Duke of Leuchtenberg (1638–1705), who married in 1668 Maurita Febronia de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne (1652–1706)

<text>The Székelys (, Székely runes: ), also referred to as Szeklers, are a Hungarian subgroup living mostly in the Székely Land in Romania. In addition to their native villages in Suceava County in Bukovina, a significant population descending from the Székelys of Bukovina currently lives in Tolna and Baranya counties in Hungary and certain districts of Vojvodina, Serbia.

In the Middle Ages, the Székelys played a role in the defense of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Ottomans in their posture as guards of the eastern border. With the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, Transylvania (including the Székely Land) became part of Romania, and the Székely population was a target of Romanianization efforts. In 1952, during the communist rule of Romania, the former counties with the highest concentration of Székely population – Mureș, Odorhei, Ciuc, and Trei Scaune – were legally designated as the Magyar Autonomous Region. It was superseded in 1960 by the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region, itself divided in 1968 into two non-autonomous counties, Harghita and Mureș. In post-Cold War Romania, where the Székelys form roughly half of the ethnic Hungarian population, members of the group have been among the most vocal of Hungarians seeking an autonomous Székely region in Transylvania. They were estimated to number about 860,000 in the 1970s and are officially recognized as a distinct minority group by the Romanian government.

Today&#x27;s Székely Land roughly corresponds to the Romanian counties of Harghita, Covasna, and central and eastern Mureș where they currently make up roughly 80% of the population. Based on the official 2011 Romanian census, 1,227,623 ethnic Hungarians live in Romania, mostly in the region of Transylvania, making up 19.6% of the population of this region. Of these, 609,033 live in the counties of Harghita, Covasna, and Mureș, which taken together have a Hungarian majority (58%). The Hungarians in Székely Land, therefore, account for half (49.41%) of the Hungarians in Romania. When given the choice on the 2011 Romanian census between ethnically identifying as &quot;Székely&quot; or as &quot;Hungarian&quot;, the overwhelming majority of the Székelys chose the latter – only 532 persons declared themselves as ethnic &quot;Székely&quot;.

==History==

The Székely territories came under the leadership of the Count of the Székelys (Latin: &quot;Comes Siculorum&quot;), initially a royal appointee from the non-Székely Hungarian nobility who was de facto a margrave; from the 15th century onward, the voivodes of Transylvania held the office themselves. The Székelys were considered a distinct ethnic group (&quot;natio Siculica&quot;) and formed part of the &quot;Unio Trium Nationum&quot; (&quot;Union of Three Nations&quot;), a coalition of three Transylvanian estates, the other two &quot;nations&quot; being the (also predominantly Hungarian) nobility and the Saxons (that is, ethnic German burghers). These three groups ruled Transylvania from 1438 onward, usually in harmony though sometimes in conflict with one another. During the Long Turkish War, the Székelys formed an alliance with Prince Michael the Brave of Wallachia against the army of Andrew Báthory, recently appointed Prince of Transylvania.

In the Middle Ages, the Székelys played a role in the defense of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Ottomans in their posture as guards of the eastern border. Nicolaus Olahus stated in the book &quot;Hungaria et Athila&quot; in 1536 that &quot;Hungarians and Székelys share the same language, with the difference that the Székelys have their own words specific to their nation.&quot; The people of Székelys were in general regarded as the most Hungarian of Hungarians. In 1558, a Hungarian poet, Mihály Vilmányi Libécz voiced this opinion, instructing the reader in his poem that if they had doubts about the correctness of the Hungarian language: &quot;Consult without fail the language of the ancient Székelys, for they are the guardians of the purest Hungarian tongue&quot;.

===Origins===

The origin of the Székelys has been much debated. It is now generally accepted that they are descendants of Hungarians. The Székelys have historically claimed descent from Attila&#x27;s Huns and believed they played a special role in shaping Hungary. Ancient legends recount that a contingent of Huns remained in Transylvania, later allying with the main Hungarian army that conquered the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. The thirteenth-century chronicler Simon of Kéza also claimed that the Székely people descended from Huns who lived in mountainous lands prior to the Hungarian conquest.

After the theory of Hunnic descent lost scholarly currency in the 20th century, two substantial ideas emerged about Székely ancestry:
* Some scholars suggested that the Székelys were simply Magyars, like other Hungarians, transplanted in the Middle Ages to guard the frontiers. Researchers could not prove that Székelys spoke a different language. In this case, their strong cultural differences from other Hungarians stem from centuries of relative isolation in the mountains.
* Others suggested Turkic origin as Avar, Kabar or Esegel-Bulgar ancestries.

Some theories suggest that the Székelys might have absorbed influences from various groups, including Turkic tribes, but this is more about cultural exchange rather than direct lineage. Overall, while there may be historical connections and interactions, the Székelys are primarily of Hungarian origin. 
* According to a new model, the Székelys are the descendants of those &quot;wanderers&quot; who ran away from the feudal state and the landlord system mostly during the 11th and 12th centuries. These parasocial groups settled in border regions and hard-to-reach places (forests, swamps) down where the institutional vacuum allowed them to found independent communities. The Hungarian kings reintegrated these groups into the kingdom&#x27;s society from the beginning of the 12th century. The Hungarian Hajdúk, Cossacks, Maroons, and ʿApiru offer an analogy for the process. 

Some historians have dated the Székely presence in the Eastern Carpathian Mountains as early as the fifth century, and found historical evidence that the Székelys were part of the Avar confederation during the so-called Dark Ages, but this does not mean that they were ethnically Avar.

Research indicates that Székelys spoke Hungarian. Toponyms at the Székely settlement area also give proof of their Hungarian mother tongue. The Székely dialect does not have more Bulgaro-Turkish loanwords derived from before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin than standard Hungarian does. Even if the Székelys had been a Turkic stock, they would have had to lose their original vernacular at a very early date.

==Genetics==
An autosomal analysis, studying non-European admixture in Europeans, found 4.4% of admixture of East Asian/Central Asian among Hungarians, which was the strongest among sampled populations. It was found at 3.6% in Belarusians, 2.5% in Romanians, 2.3% in Bulgarians and Lithuanians, 1.9% in Poles and 0% in Greeks. The authors stated &quot;This signal might correspond to a small genetic legacy from invasions of peoples from the Asian steppes (e.g., the Huns, Avars, and Bulgars) during the first millennium.&quot;

Among 100 Hungarian men (90 of them from the Great Hungarian Plain), the following haplogroups and frequencies are obtained:

The 97 Székelys belong to the following haplogroups:

It can be inferred that Szekelys have more significant German admixture. A study sampling 45 Palóc from Budapest and northern Hungary, found:

A study estimating possible Inner Asian admixture among nearly 500 Hungarians based on paternal lineages only, estimated it at 5.1% in Hungary, at 7.4% in Székelys and at 6.3% at Csangos. It has boldly been noted that this is an upper limit by deep SNPs and that the main haplogroups responsible for that contribution are J2-M172 (negative M47, M67, L24, M12), J2-L24, R1a-Z93, Q-M242 and E-M78, the last of which is typically European, while N is still negligible (1.7%). In an attempt to divide N into subgroups L1034 and L708, some Hungarian, Sekler, and Uzbek samples were found to be L1034 SNP positive, while all Mongolians, Buryats, Khanty, Finnish, and Roma samples showed a negative result for this marker. The 2,500-year-old SNP L1034 was found typical for Mansi and Hungarians, the closest linguistic relatives.

==Demographics==
The Székely live mainly in Harghita, Covasna and Mureș counties. They identify themselves as Hungarians, but they maintain a somewhat distinct ethnic identity from other Hungarians. Hungarians form a majority of the population in the counties of Covasna and Harghita. They were estimated to number about 860,000 in the 1970s and are officially recognized as a distinct minority group by the Romanian government.

The Székelys of Bukovina, today settled mostly in Vojvodina and southern Hungary, form a culturally separate group with its own history.

==Autonomy==
An autonomous Székely region existed between 1952 and 1968. First created as the Magyar Autonomous Region in 1952, it was renamed the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region in 1960. Ever since the abolition of the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region by the Ceaușescu regime in 1968, some of the Székely have pressed for their autonomy to be restored. Several proposals have been discussed within the Székely Hungarian community and by the Romanian majority. One of the Székely autonomy initiatives is based on the model of the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia. A major peaceful demonstration was held in 2006 in favor of autonomy.

In 2013 and 2014, thousands of ethnic Hungarians marched for autonomy on 10 March (on the Székely Freedom Day) in Târgu Mureș, Romania. 10 March is the anniversary of the execution in Târgu Mureș in 1854, by the Austrian authorities, of three Székelys who tried to achieve national self-determination. Since 2015, the Székelys also have the Székely Autonomy Day, celebrated every last Sunday of October.

==Literature==
Áron Tamási, a 20th-century Székely writer from Lupeni, Harghita, wrote many novels about the Székely which set universal stories of love and self-individuation against the backdrop of Székely village culture. Other Székely writers include the folklorist Elek Benedek, the novelist József Nyírő and the poet Sándor Kányádi.

==Symbols==

The flag and coat of arms of the Székelys as approved by the Szekler National Council, one of the main political organizations of the Székelys.

The Sun and Moon are the symbols of the Székelys, and are used in the coat of arms of Transylvania and on the Romanian national coat of arms. The Sun and the Moon, the symbols of the cosmic world, are known from Hungarian grave findings from the period of the Hungarian conquest. After the Hungarians became Christians in the 11th century, the importance of these icons became purely visual and symbolic. The Székelys have succeeded in preserving traditions to an extent unusual even in Central and Eastern Europe. A description of the Székely Land and its traditions was written between 1859 and 1868 by Balázs Orbán in his &quot;Description of the Székely Land&quot;.

<doc id="415478" wikidata="Q1547294" url="?curid=415478" title="Jab">
<text>A jab is a type of punch used in martial arts. Several variations of the jab exist, but every jab shares these characteristics: while in a fighting stance, the lead fist is thrown straight ahead and the arm is fully extended from the side of the torso. This process also involves a quick turn of the torso. It is an overhand punch; at the moment of impact, the pronated fist is generally held in a horizontal orientation with the palm facing the ground. This is also called a &quot;front punch.&quot;

Jabs are usually aimed at the face or function as a feint, to lead to a second punch. Dynamic muscles involved in the jab include deltoids, triceps, pectorals, and the serratus anterior in the extension of the arm, and quadriceps and calves in the body drive.

==Etymology==
The word jab was first used in 1825, to mean &quot;to thrust with a point.&quot; The term is a Scottish variant of the word &quot;job&quot;, which means &quot;to strike, pierce, thrust.&quot;

==Uses==

===Defense===
A jab is an integral part of a fighter&#x27;s defense. Its speed and power of execution and reach can keep the opponent at a distance, preventing him from charging in. Defensive jabs can be employed while moving backwards.

===Speed jab===
This jab gives a fighter high mobility and is often used with the intention of scoring points. Fighters use this variation of the jab when they want to preserve the mobility and balance of their stance.

===Rangefinding jab===
Used in order to establish a feeling for distance, the rangefinding jab is often used to set up a power punch with the other hand. Thus it can help conserve stamina and lower the risk of being countered by allowing the fighter to commit his stronger hand only when he is within proper range.

Boxers have been wobbled by a rangefinding jab.

===Power jab===
Power can be added to a jab if it is thrown with a moderate step forward. The drawback to this technique is that it takes the fighter out of his boxing stance, committing him to the punch rather more than the speed jab. A &quot;pivot jab&quot; is the most powerful jab, one in which the weight shifts almost entirely to the lead foot, which pivots to put the mass of the body behind the punch. Jabbing from the hip, rather than from a tight guard, will add power to the jab at the expense of speed.

===Jab to the body===

Jabbing to the body is relatively uncommon, because it increases a fighter&#x27;s vulnerability to a counterpunch. Typically, the fighter bends at the waist and fires a speed jab to the midsection of his opponent in an attempt at getting the opponent to drop his guard. It is impractical to put the body weight behind this punch, so power is limited. The jab to the body can be used effectively to counter the opponents lead jab.

===Jab combinations===
*Jabs are often doubled up in an attempt at getting the opponent to compromise his guard.
*&quot;Jabbing on the fly&quot; is a point-scoring maneuver that employs a quick series of speed jabs thrown by a circling fighter.
*Most combinations start with a jab as a way of closing the distance and finding the proper range. In this context, the jab is referred to as a &quot;set-up jab&quot;.
*Many fighters end their combinations with a jab that is designed to stifle counterpunches.


Historians consider some of the best &quot;jabbers&quot; in history to be Sonny Liston, Larry Holmes, Muhammad Ali, and George Foreman. Recent master jabbers include Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko, both coached by the same trainer and able to develop significant power into their jabs.
Holmes&#x27; jab has often been called &quot;the best among Heavyweights&quot;, Ali&#x27;s jab was famous for its speed and Liston&#x27;s for its power. Mike Tyson used a rare version of a slip jab, that allowed him to jab effectively against taller opponents with longer reach. Gennady Golovkin is currently the most proficient jabber in boxing.

<text>The Rosedale Network of Churches is a Christian body of Mennonite churches in the Anabaptist tradition. Rosedale Network of Churches was originally formed in 1910 by a group of Amish Mennonites to promote unity while preserving autonomy of the local congregation. 

== History ==

For the early history see &quot;History of Anabaptist Christianity&quot;.

=== Amish beginnings ===
The first American settlement of the Amish Mennonites — who in 1693 separated from the main body of Swiss Brethren and followed Jacob Amman — was in Berks County, Pennsylvania, around 1710–1720. Soon they had settlements in Chester and Lancaster counties as well. By the middle of the 19th century, they had congregations from Pennsylvania to Iowa, as well as in Ontario, Canada.

=== The major division among the Amish ===
Before the division, all factions of the Amish were either called Amish or Amish Mennonites, with no difference in meaning. Mostly in the years between 1862 and 1878 a major division occurred among the Amish, that eventually led to two major factions: The Amish Mennonites and Old Order Amish.

Some of the more liberal minded Amish ministers organized conferences to serve their churches between 1862 and 1878. After the 1878 conference, they became known as the Amish Mennonites and their ministers formed three district conferences: Eastern, Indiana-Michigan, and Western.

Other congregations remained aloof from this conference movement and became forerunners of two groups — the Old Order Amish that formed mostly in the last third of the 19th century and the &quot;Conservative (Amish) Mennonite Conference&quot; that formed in 1910. Most of the churches of the liberal minded Amish Mennonite conference movement eventually merged with other Mennonite groups.

The Old Order Amish continued to worship in private homes (in the German language) and reject innovations in both worship and lifestyle. Some congregations were theologically in between the extremely conservative Old Order Amish and the more progressive conference Amish Mennonites. These churches did not join the Amish Mennonite conferences, but, unlike the Old Order Amish, were open to the use of meetinghouses, and the organization of missionary, publication, social service, and Sunday school work. Representatives of these congregations met in a conference in Pigeon, Michigan, on November 24–25, 1910, and adopted the name &quot;Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference&quot;. &quot;Amish&quot; was dropped and the Conservative Mennonite name taken when a revised constitution was adopted in 1957.

=== Later developments ===
Concern by some members and churches within the conference over liberalizing tendencies caused a number of congregations and individuals of the Rosedale Network of Churches (then known as the CMC) to splinter or move away from this group to join Conservative Mennonite denominations. The earliest group began to be associated informally together in what was called the Conservative Mennonite Fellowship beginning in 1956 with churches in Ontario, Ohio and elsewhere. In 1998, a group of leaders in the Conservative Mennonite Conference, disagreeing with a vote by the conference ministers that resulted in the wives of ministers no longer being required to wear the prayer veiling, left the conference and formed the Biblical Mennonite Alliance.

On February 23, 2023, CMC, formerly known as Conservative Mennonite Conference, changed its name to Rosedale Network of Churches, with the tagline “a global family of Anabaptists.”

==Faith and practice==
The Rosedale Network of Churches subscribes to the &quot;Mennonite Confession of Faith of 1963&quot;, and adopted the &quot;Conservative Mennonite Statement of Theology&quot; in 1991. The statement follows orthodox Trinitarian Christian patterns of belief with typical Mennonite emphasis. Baptism is a church ordinance, which may be performed by either pouring or immersion. Communion and feet washing are also observed. The statement also affirms the traditional Anabaptist position of nonresistance toward enemies: &quot;Under God&#x27;s provision, the state uses the sword, which &#x27;is ordained of God outside the perfection of Christ&#x27; and is a function contrary to the New Testament teachings for the church and the disciple of Christ.&quot;

The sociologist Cory Anderson writes that despite its former name, the Rosedale Network of Churches (formerly the Conservative Mennonite Conference) is not categorized as a Conservative Mennonite denomination, but rather, is mainstream in orientation.

Women may engage in ministry, but leadership and ordination is restricted to men. Within congregations other roles of governance and/or teaching may be reserved for men. According to the Conservative Mennonite Statement of Practice, &quot;As the head of the wife, man was created to provide loving and sacrificial leadership. The wife was created to respond with intelligent submission.&quot;

Two meetings are held annually, one in February for the ministers, and another in August for the general public. The executive board and the general secretary are elected at the ministers&#x27; meeting to oversee day-to-day operations.

==Status==
The Rosedale Network of Churches is a North American body. In 2005 the conference had 11,199 members in 113 congregations in the United States. There was one congregation in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada. There are related bodies in other nations, such as the &quot;Costa Rica Mennonite Conference&quot; (org. 1974) and the &quot;Nicaragua Mennonite Conference&quot; (org. 1977).

The Brotherhood Beacon, the conference&#x27;s official monthly periodical, began in 1971. Before this the conference published the &quot;Herold der Wahrheit&quot;, a semi-monthly publication, starting in 1912, and later the &quot;Missionary Bulletin&quot;, a quarterly, starting in 1952.

The Rosedale Network of Churches has a number of parachurch ministries. Rosedale Bible College is an accredited, two-year Bible college serving approximately 125 students annually. The college offers degrees in Biblical Studies with a number of additional concentration areas. Rosedale International, formerly Rosedale Mennonite Missions until 2019, is the mission agency of the conference, with roughly 120 workers in some 17 countries. The conference headquarters, Rosedale Bible College, are all located in Rosedale, Ohio, a rural crossroads about 30 miles west of Columbus, Ohio. The offices of Rosedale International were also located in Rosedale until 2015 when they were moved into Columbus proper. 

The Rosedale Network of Churches maintains a loose relationship with the Mennonite Church USA (the largest Mennonite denomination), through representation on some of its major boards.

<doc id="415505" wikidata="Q7887572" url="?curid=415505" title="United Christian Church">
<text>The denomination known as the United Christian Church (UCC) is an American evangelical body of Christians with roots in the Radical Pietistic movement of Martin Boehm and Philip William Otterbein. This group may often be confused with local congregations and churches of other denominations that also use the name &quot;United Christian Church.&quot;

==History==
Those who began the United Christian Church separated from the Church of the United Brethren in Christ between the years of 1862 to 1870 over doctrinal differences of opinion. Led by Rev. George W. Hoffman, for a number of years the separatists were known as Hoffmanites. Hoffman opposed infant baptism, membership in secret societies, slavery, and the bearing of arms in war. He and others believed that some resolutions of the East Pennsylvania Conference of United Brethren were weak on the issue of bearing of arms, to the point of allowing members to do so if they chose. They also rejected the doctrine of total depravity, which was affirmed by the Church of the United Brethren in 1857. In 1877 these scattered believers formally organized and adopted a confession of faith. The name &quot;United Christian Church&quot; was adopted in 1878.

This body is an orthodox Trinitarian denomination, with emphasis on the inspiration of the Scriptures, justification by faith, regeneration, and entire sanctification. Baptism, the Lord&#x27;s supper, and feet washing are considered ordinances, with the mode of baptism being optional. A conference is held annually. 

According to a study conducted by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, the &quot;United Christian Church&quot; had 11 congregations with 770 members in Pennsylvania in 1990.

<doc id="415513" wikidata="Q868425" url="?curid=415513" title="Net force">
<text>In mechanics, the net force is the sum of all the forces acting on an object. For example, if two forces are acting upon an object in opposite directions, and one force is greater than the other, the forces can be replaced with a single force that is the difference of the greater and smaller force. That force is the net force.

When forces act upon an object, they change its acceleration. The net force is the combined effect of all the forces on the object&#x27;s acceleration, as described by Newton&#x27;s second law of motion.

When the net force is applied at a specific point on an object, the associated torque can be calculated. The sum of the net force and torque is called the [[resultant force]], which causes the object to rotate in the same way as all the forces acting upon it would if they were applied individually.

It is possible for all the forces acting upon an object to produce no torque at all. This happens when the net force is applied along the line of action.

In some texts, the terms &quot;resultant force&quot; and &quot;net force&quot; are used as if they mean the same thing. This is not always true, especially in complex topics like the motion of spinning objects or situations where everything is perfectly balanced, known as static equilibrium. In these cases, it is important to understand that &quot;net force&quot; and &quot;resultant force&quot; can have distinct meanings.

==Concept==

In physics, a force is considered a vector quantity. This means that it not only has a size (or magnitude) but also a direction in which it acts. We typically represent force with the symbol F in boldface, or sometimes, we place an arrow over the symbol to indicate its vector nature, like this: formula_1.

When we need to visually represent a force, we draw a line segment. This segment starts at a point &quot;A&quot;, where the force is applied, and ends at another point &quot;B&quot;. This line not only gives us the direction of the force (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;) but also its magnitude: the longer the line, the stronger the force.

One of the essential concepts in physics is that forces can be added together, which is the basis of vector addition. This concept has been central to physics since the times of Galileo and Newton, forming the cornerstone of Vector calculus, which came into its own in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
The picture to the right shows how to add two forces using the &quot;tip-to-tail&quot; method. This method involves drawing forces formula_2, and formula_3 from the tip of the first force. The resulting force, or &quot;total&quot; force, formula_4, is then drawn from the start of the first force (the tail) to the end of the second force (the tip). Grasping this concept is fundamental to understanding how forces interact and combine to influence the motion and equilibrium of objects. 

When forces are applied to an extended body (a body that&#x27;s not a single point), they can be applied at different points. Such forces are called &#x27;bound vectors&#x27;. It&#x27;s important to remember that to add these forces together, they need to be considered at the same point.

The concept of &quot;net force&quot; comes into play when you look at the total effect of all of these forces on the body. However, the net force alone may not necessarily preserve the motion of the body. This is because, besides the net force, the &#x27;torque&#x27; or rotational effect associated with these forces also matters. The net force must be applied at the right point, and with the right associated torque, to replicate the effect of the original forces.

When the net force and the appropriate torque are applied at a single point, they together constitute what is known as the resultant force. This resultant force-and-torque combination will have the same effect on the body as all the original forces and their associated torques.

== Parallelogram rule for the addition of forces ==
A force is known as a bound vector—which means it has a direction and magnitude and a point of application. A convenient way to define a force is by a line segment from a point &quot;A&quot; to a point &quot;B&quot;. If we denote the coordinates of these points as A = (A&quot;x&quot;, A&quot;y&quot;, A&quot;z&quot;) and B = (B&quot;x&quot;, B&quot;y&quot;, B&quot;z&quot;), then the force vector applied at &quot;A&quot; is given by
: formula_5
The length of the vector formula_6
defines the magnitude of formula_7 and is given by
: formula_8

The sum of two forces F1 and F2 applied at &quot;A&quot; can be computed from the sum of the segments that define them. Let F1 = B−A and F2 = D−A, then the sum of these two vectors is
: formula_9
which can be written as
: formula_10
where E is the midpoint of the segment BD that joins the points &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;.

Thus, the sum of the forces F1 and F2 is twice the segment joining &quot;A&quot; to the midpoint &quot;E&quot; of the segment joining the endpoints &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot; of the two forces. The doubling of this length is easily achieved by defining a segments BC and DC parallel to AD and AB, respectively, to complete the parallelogram &quot;ABCD&quot;. The diagonal AC of this parallelogram is the sum of the two force vectors. This is known as the parallelogram rule for the addition of forces.

== Translation and rotation due to a force ==

===Point forces===
When a force acts on a particle, it is applied to a single point (the particle volume is negligible): this is a point force and the particle is its application point. But an external force on an extended body (object) can be applied to a number of its constituent particles, i.e. can be &quot;spread&quot; over some volume or surface of the body. However, determining its rotational effect on the body requires that we specify its point of application (actually, the line of application, as explained below). The problem is usually resolved in the following ways:

* Often, the volume or surface on which the force acts is relatively small compared to the size of the body, so that it can be approximated by a point. It is usually not difficult to determine whether the error caused by such approximation is acceptable.
* If it is not acceptable (obviously e.g. in the case of gravitational force), such &quot;volume/surface&quot; force should be described as a system of forces (components), each acting on a single particle, and then the calculation should be done for each of them separately. Such a calculation is typically simplified by the use of differential elements of the body volume/surface, and the integral calculus. In a number of cases, though, it can be shown that such a system of forces may be replaced by a single point force without the actual calculation (as in the case of uniform gravitational force).

In any case, the analysis of the rigid body motion begins with the point force model. And when a force acting on a body is shown graphically, the oriented line segment representing the force is usually drawn so as to &quot;begin&quot; (or &quot;end&quot;) at the application point.

===Rigid bodies===

In the example shown in the diagram opposite, a single force formula_11 acts at the application point H on a free rigid body. The body has the mass formula_12 and its center of mass is the point C. In the constant mass approximation, the force causes changes in the body motion described by the following expressions:

: formula_13   is the center of mass acceleration; and

: formula_14   is the angular acceleration of the body.

In the second expression, formula_15 is the torque or moment of force, whereas formula_16 is the moment of inertia of the body. A torque caused by a force formula_11 is a vector quantity defined with respect to some reference point:

:formula_18   is the torque vector, and

:formula_19   is the amount of torque.

The vector formula_20 is the position vector of the force application point, and in this example it is drawn from the center of mass as the reference point of (see diagram). The straight line segment formula_21 is the lever arm of the force formula_1 with respect to the center of mass. As the illustration suggests, the torque does not change (the same lever arm) if the application point is moved along the line of the application of the force (dotted black line). More formally, this follows from the properties of the vector product, and shows that rotational effect of the force depends only on the position of its line of application, and not on the particular choice of the point of application along that line.

The torque vector is perpendicular to the plane defined by the force and the vector formula_23, and in this example, it is directed towards the observer; the angular acceleration vector has the same direction. The right-hand rule relates this direction to the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation in the plane of the drawing.

The moment of inertia formula_24 is calculated with respect to the axis through the center of mass that is parallel with the torque. If the body shown in the illustration is a homogeneous disc, this moment of inertia is formula_25. If the disc has the mass 0,5 kg and the radius 0,8 m, the moment of inertia is 0,16 kgm2. If the amount of force is 2 N, and the lever arm 0,6 m, the amount of torque is 1,2 Nm. At the instant shown, the force gives to the disc the angular acceleration α = /I = 7,5 rad/s2, and to its center of mass it gives the linear acceleration &quot;a&quot; = &quot;F&quot;/&quot;m&quot; = 4 m/s2.

== Resultant force ==
Resultant force and torque replaces the effects of a system of forces acting on the movement of a rigid body. An interesting special case is a torque-free resultant, which can be found as follows:
# Vector addition is used to find the net force;
# Use the equation to determine the point of application with zero torque:
:formula_26
where formula_27 is the net force, formula_28 locates its application point, and individual forces are formula_29 with application points formula_30. It may be that there is no point of application that yields a torque-free resultant.
The diagram opposite illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems:
# Lines of application of the actual forces formula_31 and formula_32 on the leftmost illustration intersect. After vector addition is performed &quot;at the location of formula_33&quot;, the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force formula_34 is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces.
# The illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition &quot;at the location of formula_32&quot;, the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, where it becomes the resultant force formula_34. The procedure is based on decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships.
# The rightmost illustration shows a couple, two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque formula_37   where formula_38  is the distance between their lines of application. Since there is no resultant force, this torque can be [is?] described as &quot;pure&quot; torque.

== Usage ==
In general, a system of forces acting on a rigid body can always be replaced by one force plus one pure (see previous section) torque. The force is the net force, but to calculate the additional torque, the net force must be assigned the line of action. The line of action can be selected arbitrarily, but the additional pure torque depends on this choice. In a special case, it is possible to find such line of action that this additional torque is zero.

The resultant force and torque can be determined for any configuration of forces. However, an interesting special case is a torque-free resultant. This is useful, both conceptually and practically, because the body moves without rotating as if it was a particle.
Some authors do not distinguish the resultant force from the net force and use the terms as synonyms.

<text>MDC is an American punk rock band formed in 1979 in Austin, Texas, subsequently based in San Francisco, and currently Portland, Oregon. Among the first wave of bands to define the sound and style of American hardcore punk, MDC originally formed as The Stains; they have periodically changed the meaning of &quot;MDC&quot;, the most frequent being Millions of Dead Cops. The band&#x27;s lyrical content expresses radical left political views and has proven influential within the punk subculture.

MDC released material through ex-Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra&#x27;s independent label Alternative Tentacles. In the 1990s, vocalist Dave Dictor published editorials for the internationally distributed fanzine &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot;. MDC&#x27;s initial run ended in 1995, and the band spent five years on hiatus, before returning in 2000 with some new band members.

==History==
===Early years===
Formed in the late 1970s as The Stains and playing their first gig under this name in August 1980, MDC were one of three pioneering hardcore punk bands in Austin, Texas, in the early &#x27;80s, alongside The Dicks and Big Boys. These bands frequently played together and established the Austin hardcore scene. They released one single as The Stains in 1981, featuring a slower version of the future MDC song &quot;John Wayne Was a Nazi&quot; backed with &quot;Born to Die&quot;. Both songs were later released on the debut MDC album.

===1980s===
Dave Dictor cited Black Flag and D.O.A. as early influences of the band: &quot;We saw [Black Flag and D.O.A.] in 1980 when they came out to Texas and they were cookin&#x27;. We said &#x27;Man. . . They&#x27;re feelin it&#x27;&quot;

By 1982 the band had relocated to San Francisco, California, and renamed themselves MDC. By this point the band were active participants in the growing hardcore scene and released their debut LP &quot;Millions of Dead Cops&quot; on their own label, R Radical; Jello Biafra&#x27;s Alternative Tentacles helped with distribution. The album is now widely considered a punk classic, and features songs such as &quot;John Wayne Was a Nazi&quot;, &quot;Dick for Brains&quot;, and the harsh criticism of the police, &quot;I Remember&quot;. Other targets of criticism devoid of irony included capitalism (&quot;Corporate Death Burger&quot;), homophobia (&quot;America&#x27;s So Straight&quot;), and American culture (&quot;Violent Rednecks&quot;).

During the summer of 1982 they became involved in the Rock Against Reagan Tour, during which time they fell out with the band Bad Brains when Rastafarian singer H.R. learned that Big Boys&#x27; singer, Randy Turner, was gay. H.R. and MDC&#x27;s Dave Dictor had an intense confrontation. Upon Bad Brains&#x27; departure from the bill, they refused to return a loan owed to Big Boys and instead left a note that reportedly read &quot;burn in hell bloodclot faggot&quot;. The incident resulted in the MDC song &quot;Pay to Come Along&quot;. For MDC, 1982 ended with a tour of Europe with the Dead Kennedys which brought the band greater exposure in the punk scene outside of the U.S., especially in the UK.

====Name change====
In 1983 the band began to deemphasize the &quot;Dead Cops&quot; aspect of its name, as drummer Al Schvitz noted in a &quot;Flipside&quot; interview:

Their involvement in the Rock Against Reagan activities continued through 1983 and they returned to recording with the EP &quot;Multi-Death Corporations&quot; which was distributed in the UK by British anarcho-punk label Crass Records and R Radical in the U.S. The EP broke new ground by addressing, in the lengthy liner notes and artwork, the growth of corporations and the violent suppression of left-wing politics in Central America. In 1984 they released another EP, &quot;Millions of Dead Children&quot; (also known as &quot;Chicken Squawk&quot;), this time dealing with vegetarian and vegan issues via a cowpunk tune.

Iconoclastic punk rock cartoonist John Crawford, an outspoken critic of the band, was cynical in his assessment of the alteration of the band&#x27;s initial name, which he characterized as &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;inflammatory&quot;. Crawford intimated that the name change had been opportunistic:

&quot;Smoke Signals&quot; was released in 1986, their second album featuring a more diverse style than previously, with a foray into &#x27;70s rock with the song &quot;South Africa Is Free&quot;. This album also saw Gordon Fraser&#x27;s first appearance as main guitarist. In the same year, MDC backed Michelle Shocked on a version of her song &quot;Fogtown&quot; that appears as a hidden track on her breakthrough album, &quot;Short Sharp Shocked&quot;.

Their third album, &quot;This Blood&#x27;s for You&quot;, followed in 1987 and saw them continuing to showcase orthodox hardcore punk style and classic rock, including a cover of the Cream song &quot;Politician&quot;. Themes again included intervention in Central America and criticism of the Reagan Administration. MDC toured Europe in 1988, where the live album &quot;Elvis – In the Rhineland&quot; was recorded. The band released the album &quot;Metal Devil Cokes&quot; in 1989 with guitar player Eric Calhoun and bassist Joe Strom.

===1990s===
The 1990s opened with a number of lineup changes, swiftly followed by the 1991 album &quot;Hey Cop! If I Had a Face Like Yours ... &quot;, featuring Bill Collins (formerly of Fang, Special Forces, Intensified Chaos) on guitar and Matt Freeman (of Operation Ivy and Rancid) on bass. Collins wrote all the music on the album and sang three of the songs. This lineup toured the US and Europe. The acclaimed &quot;Shades of Brown&quot; album appeared in 1993, released by New Red Archives in the U.S. and We Bite in Europe. The album featured the hip hop vegetarian song &quot;Real Food, Real People, Real Bullets&quot;. MDC, now with guitarist Chris Wilder (formerly of Stikky) and bassist Erica Liss, marked the album with a tour of the former Soviet Union, making MDC the first American punk band to tour Russia. This was followed by two more European tours and several U.S. tours until 1995, where began a lull in the band&#x27;s activity. The lack of new recorded material, other than a 7-inch release on Slap-a-Ham Records, and live performances after 1994, plus personal problems of band members, pointed to an informal break-up of the band.

===2000s===
MDC&#x27;s singer, Dave Dictor, returned with an entirely new backing line-up in 2000, which included Long Island musicians Matt Van Cura (bass), Erik Mischo (guitar), and John Soldo (Drums). MDC released a new album, &quot;Magnus Dominus Corpus&quot;, in 2004. They took part in a 25th anniversary world tour in 2005, with an all-original lineup. Following the death of Mikey Donaldson in September 2007, MDC has been touring the U.S. and Europe extensively with the Dictor/Posner/Smith/Schvitz lineup.

Recently, the band has been based in Portland, Oregon.

In November 2016, MDC released a video for the forthcoming release of a new recording of &quot;Born to Die&quot;, made to protest the Donald Trump presidential campaign. The song&#x27;s slogan &quot;No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA&quot; was reported to be heard at anti-Trump demonstrations, at The Women&#x27;s March in Washington, D.C., on January 21, 2017, and in Chicago. At the 2016 American Music Awards on November 20, the band Green Day adopted the anti-Trump slogan for a controversial impromptu chant during their live on-air performance, which Dictor applauded and encouraged. The media spotlight Green Day&#x27;s action put on MDC inspired the band to create new material based around the current political climate. The album, entitled &quot;Mein Trumpf&quot;, was released in 2017.

<text>Jean Erdman, Baron Dieskau (1701 – 8 September 1767) was a French Royal Army officer and nobleman who served during the War of the Austrian Succession and the French and Indian War.

==Biography==
He was the aide-de-camp of Marshal Maurice de Saxe and visited St. Petersburg in that officer&#x27;s interest in 1741. He also served in the Netherlands and in 1748 became major general of infantry and commander of Brest. He was sent to Canada on 20 February 1755 as the head of French troops to conduct the campaign against the British.

His forces comprised 600 Canadians, the same number of Indians, and 200 regular French troops. He ascended Lake Champlain to its head, designing to attack Fort Edward, but the guides took the road to Lake George by mistake . On 8 September, he was informed by scouts that a detachment of 1,000 men under Colonel Ephraim Williams of Massachusetts, had been sent against him, and disposing his men in ambush in the form of a horseshoe, he surprised the enemy and put it to flight.

After pursuing their opponents to the British camp, the Indians halted; the Canadians became alarmed; and Dieskau, with his 200 regulars, was forced to sustain the fight. For five hours, the New England militia &quot;kept up the most violent fire that had yet been known in America.&quot; Almost all the French regulars perished , and Dieskau himself was wounded three times but refused to retire and seated himself on a stump exposed to the bullets. Finally, seeing a soldier approaching as if to capture him, Dieskau put his hand into his pocket for his watch, which he intended to give to his captor, but the man, supposing that he was drawing a pistol, shot him and inflicted a wound that ultimately caused Dieskau&#x27;s death over a decade later.

The event became known as the Battle of Lake George. Dieskau was kept a prisoner until 1763, when he was exchanged and returned to France, where he was given a pension. Command in Canada passed to Louis-Joseph de Montcalm.

He has won 18 billiards world titles, the IBSF World Billiards Championship on 17 occasions and the World Team Billiards Championship once. In snooker, he won the IBSF World Snooker Championship three times, IBSF World six-red championship twice and the IBSF World Team Cup and IBSF World Team Championship one time each.

In recognition of his achievements, the Government of India has bestowed several awards upon Advani: the Arjuna Award in 2004, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna in 2006, Padma Shri in 2009 and Padma Bhushan in 2018.

==Early life==
Pankaj Advani was born on 24 July 1985 to a Sindhi family in Pune, India. Advani spent his initial years in Kuwait before moving to Bangalore, India. He received his education at the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore and completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Commerce from Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College. He received training in snooker from former national Snooker champion Arvind Savur.

At the age of 10 his acumen for snooker came to the notice of Arvind Savur after being introduced to the sport by his elder brother Dr. Shree Advani, a noted Sport &amp; Performance Psychologist. He won his first ever title at the age of 11 and went on to set several records at the state and national levels. In the year 2000 he won his first Indian Junior Billiards Championship title and then went on to win it again in 2001 and 2003. In 2003 he not only won the Indian Junior Snooker and Billiards Championship, he also won the senior snooker champions which made him the youngest National Snooker champion at age 17.

==Billiards career==

Advani made his international competitive debut in 1999 at the World Billiards Championship in England. After World Snooker Champion title win in 2003, he won the IBSF World Billiards Championship in 2005 at Qawra, Malta, where he became the first to achieve a &quot;Grand Double&quot; by winning both the time and point formats, making him the first cueist to achieve that feat. He has won the &quot;Grand Double&quot; on three occasions, 2008 in Bangalore, 2014 in England and 2018 in Myanmar. He is the only Indian to have won the amateur world title in both snooker and billiards.

Advani has the distinction of winning all five national, regional, and world billiards tournaments in a single season, a feat he achieved by winning the Indian Junior National Championship and Senior National Championship, the Asian Billiards Championship, and both the World Billiards Championship (point format) and World Billiards Championship (time format) in 2005.

In April 2012, Advani won the Asian Billiards Championship in Goa, India to become the first player to win 5 Asian Billiards Champion titles. It was announced in May that Advani had accepted the Indian wildcard place on the main snooker tour for the 2012–13 season.

In October 2012, in Leeds, England, Advani won his seventh (counting professional and amateur) World Billiards Championship title, eighth world title overall, beating defending and nine-time WPBSA World Billiards Champion Mike Russell again, in the timed division final (Advani did not make it to the points division final).

On 14 August 2014, Advani helped win the first ever World Team Billiards Championship held in Glasgow, Scotland, along with Rupesh Shah, Devendra Joshi and Ashok Shandilya.

On 2 February 2017, Pankaj Advani won his 29th National Championship Title at the PYC Hindu Gymkhana in Pune, India. This gave him a 39 match-winning streak. Overall, as of 2017 Advani had won 60 titles: 19 world titles; 8 Asian titles; 2 Asian Games titles; 1 Australian Open title and 30 national titles.

In 2018, Advani won his 7th Asian Billiards Title in Myanmar making him the maximum holder of the Asian Title. On March 11, 2020, won the 6 reds national snooker championship in Ahmedabad taking his total tally of national champions to 34. (11 junior and 23 senior).

==Snooker career==

Pankaj Advani, on international competitive debut in the discipline, won the IBSF World Snooker Championship (i.e. the World Amateur Snooker Championship) on 25 October 2003 in Jiangmen, China. He was 18 years old, and became the youngest Indian to win the title, his first world title. When he was 28-years-old, at the IBSF World 6-Red World Snooker Championship in Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt, a feat he repeated in August 2015 after he successfully defended the title in Karachi, Pakistan.

As a new player on the tour, Advani would need to win four matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events. He did this in just his fourth attempt, when qualifying for the International Championship. He defeated Craig Steadman 6–1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6–5 (after being 1–4 down), Alan McManus 6–3 and Michael Holt 6–4 to reach the venue stage for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He made four s during qualification, the most of any player. Advani was to play a wildcard match once at the tournament in Chengdu, China, to reach the last 32, however he decided to withdraw from the tournament to take part in the World Billiards Championship, which he went on to win. He also reached the semi-finals of the minor ranking European Tour Event 1, beating four-time world champion John Higgins 4–1 along the way. Advani lost to Mark Selby 2–4. Advani played in eight of the ten of these Players Tour Championship events and finished 40th on the Order of Merit.

At the 2013 Welsh Open, he became the first Indian player to reach the quarter-final stage of a ranking event with a 4–1 win over Graeme Dott in the last 16, but lost 2–5 to Judd Trump. Advani&#x27;s season ended when he was beaten 8–10 by Joe Swail in the first round of World Championship Qualifying. He was ranked world number 74 after his first year on the main snooker tour.

===2013/2014===
The 2013–14 season saw the introduction of a ranking event in Advani&#x27;s home country of India for the first time which he qualified for by beating Matthew Selt 4–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the tournament in New Delhi Advani defeated Marcus Campbell 4–1 and Mark Allen 4–2. His match with Allen finished at 11 pm local time, with Advani back in last 16 action at 10 am the next morning to play Stuart Bingham. The match went to a deciding frame and when Bingham broke down on a break of 30, Advani stepped in to compose a match winning 86. Advani played compatriot Aditya Mehta in the quarter-finals in an iconic match in Indian snooker as the winner would be the country&#x27;s first ranking event semi-finalist. The match was heavily focused on safety and it was Mehta who advanced with a 4–3 win. His best run in a ranking event during the rest of the season was at the World Open, where he narrowly beat Xiao Guodong 5–4 to set up a last 32 meeting with Ding Junhui. Advani had a lead of 4–2 in the best of nine frame match and was 35 points to 0 ahead in the seventh frame to be on the cusp of a shock result against the player who had already won four ranking events this season. However, Ding made a break of 52 to win the frame, compiled a 136 to draw level and won the deciding frame in one visit to defeat Advani. Advani&#x27;s successful season saw him finish inside the top 64 in the world rankings for the first time as he was placed 56th.

===2014/2015 ===
Advani didn&#x27;t enter any tournaments until September 2014, when he announced that he was relinquishing his snooker tour card to concentrate on his billiards career and spend more time with his family. He received an invite to participate in the wildcard round of the 2015 Indian Open, but lost 4–3 to Rhys Clark.

=== 2015/2016 ===
In May 2016 he won the Asian 6-Red Snooker title. He became the first player in the world to hold the world title as well as the continental title at the same time after he beat Malaysian Keen Hoh Moh 7–5. In the same tournament, Advani sailed to the semi-finals of the World Amateur Snooker Championship where he lost to Thailand&#x27;s Kritsanut Lertsattayathorn.

=== 2016/2017 ===
Advani received an entry in to the wildcard round of the Indian Open and he beat Fang Xiongman 4–2 and Elliot Slessor 4–0, before losing 4–3 to Stephen Maguire in the third round. He won all of his group matches at the Six-red World Championship and then eliminated Lukas Kleckers 6–0 and Yuan Sijun 6–4. Michael Holt withdrew from the event which moved Advani straight in to the semi-finals, where he was defeated 7–4 by Ding Junhui.

<doc id="415546" wikidata="Q233686" url="?curid=415546" title="Mamie Eisenhower">
<text>Mary Geneva &quot;Mamie&quot; Eisenhower (; November 14, 1896 – November 1, 1979) was the First Lady of the United States from 1953 to 1961 as the wife of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Born in Boone, Iowa, she was raised in a wealthy household in Colorado. She married Eisenhower, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, in 1916. She kept house and served as hostess for military officers as they moved between various postings in the United States, Panama, the Philippines, and France. Their relationship was complicated by his regular absences on duty and by the death of their firstborn son at the age of three. She became a prominent figure during World War II as General Eisenhower&#x27;s wife.

As first lady, Eisenhower was given near total control over the expenses and scheduling of the White House. She closely managed the staff, and her frugality was apparent in White House budgeting throughout her tenure. She entertained many foreign heads of state in her role as hostess. She showed little interest in politics and was rarely involved in political discussion, though she did support soldiers&#x27; welfare and civil rights causes. She had poor balance due to Ménière&#x27;s disease, giving rise to rumors of alcoholism. She was a popular first lady, and recognized as a fashion icon, known for her iconic bangs and frequent use of the color pink. The Eisenhowers were married for 52 years, until Dwight&#x27;s death in 1969. She spent most of her retirement and widowhood at the family farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, before returning to Washington in her final years, where she died in 1979. Eisenhower was the last First Lady born in the 19th century.

==Early life==

Mary Geneva &quot;Mamie&quot; Doud was born in Boone, Iowa, as the second child of meatpacking executive John Sheldon Doud and Elivera Mathilda Carlson. She grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Pueblo, Colorado; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Denver, Colorado; and the Doud winter home in San Antonio, Texas. Her mother was a daughter of Swedish immigrants, and Swedish was often spoken at home. Her father ran a meatpacking company founded by his father, Doud &amp; Montgomery, until he retired at age 36. He also had investments in Illinois and Iowa stockyards, producing a sizeable fortune. His wealth provided the family with many comforts, including servants who tended to their needs and connections with high society.

Mamie had three sisters: her older sister, Eleanor Carlson Doud, and her two younger sisters, Eda Mae Doud and Mabel Frances &quot;Mike&quot; Doud. The family was beset by tragedy early in Mamie&#x27;s life when Eleanor died at age 17. Their parents operated under a strict separation of spheres, whereby the father made decisions for the family and the business and the mother ran the household. Having a staff to tend to the household&#x27;s needs, Mamie never learned to keep house, a skill she would have to learn from her husband. She came down with a severe case of rheumatic fever as a child, bringing about lifelong health concerns. Though her education was limited, her father taught her to manage budgeting and finance. Her family traveled extensively, and when she grew older, she was sent to Wolcott School for Girls for finishing school.

==Marriage and family==
=== Marriage ===

Doud had many suitors, but she began courting Dwight D. &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower in 1915, who at the time was a second lieutenant. They were introduced while the Douds were visiting a friend at Fort Sam Houston. He broke convention by inviting her to tour the facility with him while he made his rounds. She was immediately infatuated with him, but turned him down when he asked her on a date. He pursued her for the following month as she courted other suitors before they began to date exclusively, and they were engaged on the Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1916. Ike initially gave her a miniature of his West Point class ring, as was customary. At her request, he later gave her a full-size ring, and he formally asked permission to marry her on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Mamie celebrated both Valentine&#x27;s Day and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day as anniversaries of their engagement.

Mamie&#x27;s father agreed to the marriage on the condition that Eisenhower did not enter the Army Air Service, as he considered it too dangerous. Apprehension of American entry into World War I accelerated their plans to wed, and they were married at the Doud family&#x27;s home in Denver on July 1, 1916. They went on honeymoon and visited Ike&#x27;s parents in Abilene, Kansas, before returning to Fort Sam Houston, where Ike was stationed. Mamie also met Ike&#x27;s brother, Milton S. Eisenhower, who became a close friend to Mamie.

=== Army wife ===
Eisenhower lived the life of an army wife over the following years, continually moving as her husband was stationed at different posts. Over the course of Ike&#x27;s 37 years in the military, they lived in 33 different homes. During some of these postings, she participated in community projects, such as the establishment of a hospital in Panama. Their military housing was often meager, and she was tasked with furnishing their temporary homes and making them livable. The Eisenhowers regularly entertained wherever they lived, and their home came to be known as &quot;Club Eisenhower&quot;. Mamie often attended card parties and luncheons with officers&#x27; wives, befriending many of them, but had little patience for the gossip and intrigue that sometimes took place, refusing to take part in it.

Eisenhower no longer had the comforts that she had grown accustomed to in childhood. They had to survive on Ike&#x27;s military pay and occasional support from Mamie&#x27;s father. Ike and Mamie were often both physically and emotionally distant from each other, and Mamie experienced bouts of depression throughout her time as an army wife. She had to grow accustomed to fear and loneliness during periods of separation while her husband was traveling for the army, and Ike once told her that his duty would &quot;always come first&quot;.

The Eisenhowers had two sons. Their first, Doud Dwight &quot;Icky&quot; Eisenhower, was born on September 24, 1917. Having to care for him on her own despite her weak health, Mamie worked herself to exhaustion. Icky died of scarlet fever at age three on January 2, 1921. Mamie was devastated, and had little to distract herself from the tragedy. Their second son, John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower, was born in Denver on August 3, 1922. His birth helped alleviate some of the depression brought about by her firstborn&#x27;s death and her separations from Ike, and she doted on John well into adulthood. John served in the military, was the United States Ambassador to Belgium, and wrote several books.

In 1922, Ike was stationed in Panama, and Mamie struggled in the jungle environment. They went to Denver shortly before John&#x27;s birth, and Mamie stayed behind after Ike returned to Panama. She rejoined him in Panama two months later, accompanied by a nurse the family had hired to help raise John. On the advice of the wife of General Fox Conner, Mamie took interest in Ike&#x27;s career and presented herself as a supportive military wife, strengthening their relationship. In 1928, she encouraged her husband to take a position in Paris instead of in the War Department. She hosted increasingly important guests as her husband&#x27;s military career progressed. When Ike was appointed as aide to General Douglas MacArthur in 1929, the family moved to Washington, D.C., and &quot;Club Eisenhower&quot; became a popular social hub for the city&#x27;s elite. She initially chose to stay in Washington when her husband was stationed in the Philippines in 1935, and their relationship was strained by the time she joined him the following year. The family returned to the U.S. shortly after the onset of World War II in 1939.

=== General&#x27;s wife ===

During World War II, while promotion and fame came to Ike, his wife lived in Washington, D.C. During the three years Ike was stationed in Europe, Mamie saw him only once. She made her own contributions to the war effort, volunteering anonymously for the American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services and the United Service Organizations, among other groups. Mamie constantly worried about her husband&#x27;s safety while he led the war effort in Europe, and was regularly accosted by reporters, causing her to lose 20 pounds during the war. Rumors emerged that she was an alcoholic, though no evidence supported this claim. Her struggle was further complicated by Ike&#x27;s close relationship with his chauffeur, Kay Summersby; she had become a close confidante of Ike&#x27;s, and rumors emerged that he had taken her as a mistress. Ike&#x27;s military success and his subsequent memoirs provided the couple with financial stability after the war.

After Ike became president of Columbia University in 1948, the Eisenhowers purchased a farm (now the Eisenhower National Historic Site) at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the first home they had ever owned. She continued in her hosting duties, this time for faculty wives and large donors in addition to the friends her husband had made in the military. Ike was then made commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, and their return to Paris delayed work on their dream home, which was not completed until 1955. In Europe, the two regularly received royals, and Mamie was awarded the Cross of Merit for her role in her husband&#x27;s military success. When Ike agreed to run in the 1952 presidential election, Mamie campaigned for him. She appeared to enjoy campaigning, and was popular among voters. She sometimes subverted her husband&#x27;s campaign managers&#x27; wishes, making speaking appearances without their knowledge and suggesting changes to his speeches.

==First Lady of the United States==
=== White House hostess ===

Eisenhower became first lady as the position first began to present a national public image. She maligned the attention associated with the role, insisting that her husband was the public figure of the family and generally refusing to take on duties outside the White House. She maintained distance from the press, avoiding interviews and having her secretary Mary Jane McCaffree address reporters in her stead. She also declined a request to write a column for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, and held only one press conference during her tenure. She was friendly with reporters when they did interact, insisting that they address her as Mamie. Her ambivalence toward the press did not extend toward photographers, whom she readily accommodated. She also wrote a personal response to every letter she received and sometimes passed on concerns the letters raised.

Despite her reservations about public life, Eisenhower enjoyed her role as a hostess. During her time as first lady, she entertained many heads of state. In total, she entertained about 70 official foreign visitors. She was a capable hostess, having spent much of her adult life hosting as a military wife. She hosted social events full time and reveled in the pageantry associated with the presidency. Eisenhower was lauded for her social prowess, greeting and shaking hands with thousands of people during her tenure as first lady. When entertaining, she prioritized comfort and popular taste over prestige. She often employed male quartets and musicians such as Fred Waring to perform for guests at the White House.

Media coverage of Eisenhower was generally favorable, focusing on her personality and charm rather than politics or scandal.

=== Managing the White House ===
Eisenhower took naturally to managing the White House and its staff, drawing on her experience as an army wife. She had a strained relationship with the staff after taking charge, having imposed many rules to liken them to more traditional house staff and managing them closely. Over time she built relationships with the staff, treating them as family and even celebrating their birthdays. When their house in Gettysburg was completed in 1955, they celebrated by throwing a housewarming party for the White House staff. Eisenhower typically managed the White House from her bedroom, staying in bed due to her poor health. The Eisenhowers were accustomed to splitting their responsibilities, and Mamie was given total authority over house spending and scheduling. She had developed a strict frugality as an army wife, and micromanaged White House expenses. She clipped coupons for the White House staff and her recipe for &quot;Mamie&#x27;s million dollar fudge&quot; was very popular.

During her tenure, she had several rooms redecorated in her favorite colors, pink and green. Eisenhower was especially active during the Christmas season, during which she had the White House heavily decorated for the occasion and bought gifts for the White House staff. In 1958, she was also reported to be the first person to initiate Halloween decorations for the White House. Her attempts to decorate the White House were complicated by lack of federal funding, and many of her changes depended on private donations. She dedicated much time to the flower arrangements of the White House, favoring gladioli. Her possessiveness over White House decor sometimes caused conflict with the staff, as it contradicted the recognized norm that the first family were residents rather than owners of the White House. She held great reverence for the building, saying that she &quot;never drove up to the south portico without a lump coming to [her] throat&quot;.

When Ike had a heart attack in 1955, Mamie helped keep him warm and get him medical attention. Afterward, she regularly tended to him, limiting his work schedule, managing his diet, and taking his mail. She also had a room set aside upstairs in the White House where he could practice his painting in solitude. She gave him strong emotional support at a time when he lacked the energy or desire to carry out his responsibilities as president. When it was unclear whether Ike would run for reelection in 1956 due to his health, Mamie encouraged him to run. She was protective of him during his periods of illness, at one point informing Pat Nixon without his knowledge that he was not healthy enough to campaign for Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election. Mamie also had medical concerns of her own; among others, she was uneasy on her feet due to Ménière&#x27;s disease, an inner-ear disorder that affects equilibrium, which fed rumors that she had a drinking problem.

=== Politics ===
Eisenhower had little interest in the presidency&#x27;s political aspects, and was never directly involved in her husband&#x27;s decisions. She entered the West Wing of the White House only four times during her tenure. This lack of political involvement contributed to her subservient image that protected her from heavy media scrutiny and bolstered her popularity. The main political cause that interested her was social issues, including women&#x27;s issues and civil rights. She expressed a desire to see women elected to Congress, and sponsored several women&#x27;s clubs. She also invited Black women to the White House, including Marian Anderson and the National Council of Negro Women. Other causes she supported include soldiers&#x27; benefits, civil defense, blood drives, and the United Nations. After her husband&#x27;s heart attack, she chaired fundraising for the American Heart Association. The president also consulted her at times on economic issues, having depended on her for finance throughout their marriage.

Her control over the guest list and social scheduling allowed Eisenhower some degree of political influence. When organizing the 1953 annual vice president&#x27;s dinner, she invited every senator except Joseph McCarthy, allowing the president to maintain distance from McCarthy without taking a stance. When the President of Haiti visited the White House, she ensured he would be received with full honors to celebrate the first Black head of state to visit the White House. Most of her influence in the Oval Office came through her social role; she made a point of knowing the president&#x27;s cabinet members and support staff, and congratulated them and their wives on successes to improve morale.

Eisenhower was reportedly unhappy with the idea of John F. Kennedy coming into office following her husband&#x27;s term and expressed displeasure about new First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, calling her &quot;the college girl&quot;. Jacqueline Kennedy had given birth to John Jr. via caesarean section two weeks before a planned tour of the White House, but Mamie did not inform her that a wheelchair was available for her to use while showing her the various sections of the White House. Seeing Eisenhower&#x27;s displeasure during the tour, Kennedy kept her composure in Eisenhower&#x27;s presence, collapsing in private once she returned home. When Eisenhower was later asked why she would do such a thing, she replied, &quot;Because she never asked.&quot;

==Later life==

In 1961, Eisenhower retired with the former president to Gettysburg, their first permanent home. They also had a retirement home in Palm Desert, California. She made appearances on occasion for the Kennedy administration, including a fundraiser for the National Cultural Center and a state dinner with the Prime Minister of Japan. As her husband was dying, legislation passed that guaranteed lifetime Secret Service protection for presidential widows. Following Ike&#x27;s death in March 1969, Mamie went to Belgium, where their son was serving as ambassador. After returning to the U.S., she continued to live full-time on the farm until she took an apartment in Washington, D.C., as her health declined in the late 1970s. She often stayed in her bedroom after her husband&#x27;s death while Secret Service agents supported her.

Eisenhower remained close to the Nixon family after her tenure as first lady, and her grandson married the Nixons&#x27; daughter in 1968. She appeared in a commercial to support Richard Nixon&#x27;s reelection in the 1972 presidential election, and the Nixons regularly invited Mamie to the White House throughout the Nixon presidency. She took stronger political stances later in life; she supported the Vietnam War, though she recognized the hardship faced by American soldiers, and opposed the women&#x27;s liberation movement. She supported Dick Thornburgh for governor of Pennsylvania, and George H. W. Bush in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries. In 1973, Eisenhower finally addressed rumors of alcoholism in an interview, explaining the nature of her vertigo. Rumors of Ike&#x27;s alleged affair with Kay Summersby reemerged in the 1970s, though Mamie continued to say that she did not believe them.

=== Death ===
Eisenhower had a stroke on September 25, 1979. She was rushed to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where her husband had died a decade before. Eisenhower remained in the hospital, and on October 31, announced to her granddaughter Mary Jean that she would die the next day. She died in her sleep on the morning of November 1. A memorial service was held in the Fort Myer chapel on November 5 with attendants including the Nixons, Rosalynn Carter, Senator Jacob Javits, Federal Reserve Chair Arthur F. Burns, and Eisenhower&#x27;s Secret Service agents. She was buried beside her husband in his hometown of Abilene, Kansas.

== Legacy ==
Eisenhower&#x27;s birthplace is open to the public and operated by the Mamie Doud Eisenhower Foundation. Places bearing the name Mamie Eisenhower include a park in Denver and a library in the Denver suburb of Broomfield, Colorado. She was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1985.

=== Impact on fashion ===
Eisenhower was known for her sense of fashion, and many women adopted her style. The New York Dress Institute named her one of the 12 best-dressed women in the country every year that she was first lady. Her style was known as the &quot;Mamie Look&quot;; it involved a full-skirted dress, pink gloves, charm bracelets, pearls, little hats, purses, and bobbed, banged hair. Her style was associated with Dior&#x27;s postwar &quot;New Look&quot;, and included both high- and low-end items. Her frugality affected her style, as she often sought out bargains and kept clothes long after buying them.

Eisenhower wore a Nettie Rosenstein gown to the 1953 inaugural balls, a pink peau de soie gown embroidered with more than 2,000 rhinestones. It is one of the most popular of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History&#x27;s collection of inaugural gowns. Eisenhower paired it with matching gloves, and jewelry by Trifari. She carried a beaded purse by Judith Leiber (then an employee of Nettie Rosenstein). Her shoes by Delman had her name printed on the left instep. Eisenhower first adopted her iconic bangs while Ike was stationed in Panama; she found that the hairstyle helped her keep cool in the tropical environment, and decided to keep it after returning to the United States. She owned many cosmetics and perfumes, and often visited a beauty spa to maintain her appearance. Eisenhower&#x27;s fondness for a specific shade of pink, often called &quot;First Lady&quot; or &quot;Mamie&quot; pink, kicked off a national trend for pink clothing, housewares, and bathrooms.

===Historical assessments===
Eisenhower is remembered neither as a traditionalist like Bess Truman nor as an activist like Eleanor Roosevelt. Her tenure occurred at a time when the role was undergoing major changes and growing in prominence. Her influence on the Eisenhower administration was reserved, respecting a strict division between her husband&#x27;s public life and their home life. To the public she symbolized the glamor, style, and growth associated with the United States in the 1950s. She played the role of the &quot;perfect wife&quot; of her era: highly feminine, subservient to her husband, and focused on the household. The most significant effect she had on the position of first lady was the organization of a dedicated personal staff that became the Office of the First Lady of the United States.

Since 1982, Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted a survey asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Eisenhower has been ranked:
In an additional question accompanying the 2014 survey, Eisenhower placed third among 20th- and 21st-century first ladies who historians felt could have done more. In the 2014 survey, Eisenhower and her husband were also ranked 14th out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<doc id="415555" wikidata="Q1438485" url="?curid=415555" title="Fort William and Mary">
<text>Fort William and Mary was a colonial-era fortification in Great Britain&#x27;s worldwide system of defenses, defended by soldiers of the Province of New Hampshire who reported directly to the royal governor. The fort, originally known as &quot;The Castle,&quot; was situated on the island of New Castle, New Hampshire, at the mouth of the Piscataqua River estuary. It was renamed Fort William and Mary circa 1692, after the accession of the monarchs William III and Mary II to the British throne. It was captured by Patriot forces, recaptured, and later abandoned by the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). The fort was renamed Fort Constitution in 1808 following rebuilding, in light of increasing hostilities with the British again, especially from its Royal Navy, resulting in the subsequent War of 1812. The fort was further rebuilt and expanded through 1899, following the Spanish-American War. It served actively through the first half of the 20th century to World War II.

== Colonial period ==
First fortified by the English Army prior to 1632, the fort guarded access to the harbor at Portsmouth. It was later manned by the successor British Army and served as the colony&#x27;s main munitions depot and seaport. The fort also served to protect Kittery (then part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay colony and later in future state of Maine) on the opposite shore of the harbor, which was raided numerous times by the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy during the French and Indian Wars (1753-1763). Shadrach Walton, British colonial administrator and soldier, commanded the fort during different periods at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century.

== American Revolution ==
In 1774, it was the only permanently occupied military post in New Hampshire.

=== 1774 raids ===

On December 14, 1774, local Patriots from the Portsmouth area, led by local political leader and rebel activist John Langdon, stormed the post (overcoming a six-man caretaker detachment) and seized the garrison&#x27;s gunpowder supply, which was distributed to local militia through several New Hampshire towns for potential use in the looming struggle against Great Britain. On the following day, patriots led by colonial military officer John Sullivan again raided the fort, this time seizing with greater effort of numerous heavy artillery of cannon, ammunition and supplies for the rebel cause.

== Fort Constitution ==
Following the Revolution, the fort was called &quot;Castle Fort&quot; or &quot;Fort Castle&quot;. The new state of New Hampshire gave the ground around Fort Point, on which the old fort stood, to the federal government in 1791. In 1800, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard was established upriver on Fernald&#x27;s Island (now part of Seavey&#x27;s Island), and the fort was rebuilt under the Second System of U.S. coastal defense fortifications. Brick and masonry walls were doubled in height, and new brick buildings were added inside. Work was completed in 1808 and the defense renamed &quot;Fort Constitution&quot;. On July 4, 1809, an accidental explosion marred Independence Day / Fourth of July celebrations at the fort, killing a number of soldiers and civilians. Two years later, the U.S. Secretary of War&#x27;s report on fortifications for December 1811 described Fort Constitution as &quot;an enclosed irregular work of masonry, mounting 36 heavy guns... (with) brick barracks for two companies...&quot; During the War of 1812 the fort was occupied and expanded with Walbach Tower, a Martello tower with a single 32-pounder cannon, being built in 1814, just before the conflict ended.

Over four decades later, during the American Civil War (1861-1865), Fort Constitution was projected to be rebuilt as a three-tiered granite fort under the new expanded, more formidable Third System of U.S. coastal defense fortifications. However, advances in weaponry, particularly the development and use of armored, steam-powered warships with heavy rifled guns, rendered the masonry walls design obsolete before they were finished. The fort&#x27;s construction was abandoned in 1867 following the Civil War with the older now-obsolete Second System fort still largely intact and two walls from the revised expanded Third System cut short, built around parts of it. At some point in the Civil War era, four 100-pounder (6.4 inch, 163 mm) Parrott rifled cannon were mounted at the fort, and remained there at least four more decades through late 1903.
In 1897, construction began on Battery Farnsworth, located under the hill on which the ruins of the former Walbach Tower of 1814 stand, as part of the large-scale War Department&#x27;s Board of Fortifications began the latest improvements with the Endicott Program of seacoast fortifications. It was part of the larger surrounding Coast Defenses of Portsmouth, along with nearby Fort Stark and Fort Foster in Kittery to the north. The battery was completed in 1899, a year after the successful conclusion of the Spanish-American War. Named for Union Army Brigadier General Elon J. Farnsworth (1837-1863), killed at the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War, the new reinforced-concrete installation, built partly below ground in a deep trench as the new protective style required, included two 8-inch (203 mm) M1888 guns on recently developed disappearing carriages. The battery was accompanied in 1904 by the construction of adjacent Battery Hackleman, named for Union General Pleasant A. Hackleman, with two 3-inch (76 mm) M1903 guns on pedestal mounts. A mine casemate for an underwater minefield in the harbor was built; Battery Hackleman was built primarily to defend this minefield against naval minesweepers vessels. These were similar to numerous other Endicott-style fortifications built all along the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf of Mexico coasts throughout the country outside of major cities on river mouths, harbors, and inlets / bays during the late 1890s and early 1900s.

After the American entry into World War I in April 1917, many guns were removed from coast defenses for shipment across the Atlantic Ocean to potential service on the Western Front in northern France, against the attacking German Empire and its Imperial German Army. Both 8-inch guns of Battery Farnsworth were removed in October 1917 for use as railway artillery and were not returned to the fort. Following the war, in 1920 a mine casemate was built next to Battery Farnsworth to replace a similar facility at nearby Fort Stark.

In the Second World War (1939/1941-1945), Battery Hackleman&#x27;s 3-inch guns were sent to a new battery of the same name further south at Fort H. G. Wright on Fisher&#x27;s Island, New York. They were replaced by two 3-inch (76 mm) M1902 guns taken from Battery Hays (named for Union Army General Alexander Hays, killed at the Civil War Battle of the Wilderness) at Fort Stark. In 1940-1944 the Harbor Defenses of Portsmouth were garrisoned by the 22nd Coast Artillery Regiment of the U.S. Army, and a mine observation station was built atop Battery Farnsworth. Following the surrender of the Axis Powers, Battery Hackleman was disarmed by 1948 and the fort was turned over to the Coast Guard. Battery Hackleman was eventually demolished, but Battery Farnsworth can still be seen as part of the subsequent state park.

With the site given back to the State of New Hampshire by the American military in 1961, the new Fort Constitution State Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and is today open to the public.

== The lighthouse ==
Since 1771 the fort has been home to a lighthouse. The current installation, the Portsmouth Harbor Light, was completed in 1878. Its Fourth Order Fresnel lens remains a valuable aid to navigation. The tower and the grounds immediately around it are open for scheduled tours.

<doc id="415556" wikidata="Q233652" url="?curid=415556" title="Bess Truman">
<text>Elizabeth Virginia Truman (; February 13, 1885October 18, 1982) was the wife of President Harry S. Truman and the 32nd First Lady of the United States from 1945 to 1953. She had previously served as second lady of the United States from January to April 1945. At , she is the longest-lived first and second lady.

She was born in Independence, Missouri, where she kept a home her entire life. She had known Harry since they were children, though she did not return his affections until adulthood. She was strongly affected by the suicide of her father when she was 18, which shaped her opinions about privacy from the public eye and the responsibilities of a spouse. Bess and Harry married in 1919, and Bess spent the following years managing the Truman household and working in her husband&#x27;s offices as his political career advanced. She was apprehensive about Harry running for vice president in 1944, and she was deeply upset when he ascended to the presidency the following year.

As first lady, Bess avoided social obligations and media attention whenever possible, and she made regular excursions to her home in Independence. She chose not to continue in the regular press conferences carried out by her predecessor Eleanor Roosevelt, believing that her responsibility as a wife was to keep her opinions private. Her influence on her husband&#x27;s presidency came about in their private conversations, as he would consult her about most major decisions during his presidency. She was also prominent in his reelection campaign, making regular appearances for crowds as he toured the United States. She was greatly relieved when Harry chose not to run for another term in 1952. After her tenure as first lady, Bess lived in retirement at her home in Independence until her death in 1982.

Truman was generally popular among her contemporaries, but her lifelong devotion to privacy has allowed for limited historical analysis. She refused to provide information about herself or her beliefs to journalists during her lifetime, and she destroyed many of her letters after leaving the White House. There is no consensus among historians on her performance as first lady or to what extent she influenced her husband&#x27;s presidency.

== Early life ==
Bess was born as Elizabeth Virginia Wallace on February 13, 1885, in Independence, Missouri, to Margaret Elizabeth Gates and David Willock Wallace. Margaret was the daughter of a businessman, and David was a local politician. Bess was known as Bessie during her childhood, and she had three younger brothers (Frank, George, and Fred). Her only sister died in infancy. As a child, Bess had a reputation as a tomboy due in part to her propensity for sports, including golf, tennis, horseback riding, shot put, basketball, baseball, and ice skating. She learned dancing and etiquette, and she attended town balls and hayrides of the town&#x27;s aristocracy.

In 1903, when Bess was 18, her father died by suicide. According to the biographer David McCullough, the cause for his suicide is unknown, with speculation ranging from depression to mounting debts. Bess spent the following hours pacing silently in her backyard, first alone and then joined by her closest friend Mary Paxton. Her father&#x27;s suicide was scandalous, and the family moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, for a year to avoid the community&#x27;s attention. Bess later attempted to keep this part of her life a secret. After her father&#x27;s death, Bess took responsibility for raising her younger brothers, and the family moved into the home of her maternal grandparents. Bess&#x27;s mother became a lifelong recluse, and the ordeal imprinted upon Bess the belief that a husband and wife should be close partners in everything they do. She refused to speak about her father for the rest of her life.

After graduating from Independence High School (now known as William Chrisman High School) she studied at Miss Barstow&#x27;s Finishing School for Girls in Kansas City, Missouri. Bess played on the women&#x27;s basketball team, and she studied literature and French. As a young woman, Bess enjoyed expressing herself through fashion and hats; in the words of a friend, &quot;Bess always had more stylish hats than the rest of us did, or she wore them with more style.&quot; After returning from school, she resumed her role as the head of the family, and she became involved with the community through her bridge club and her charity work with the Needlework Guild. It was at this time that she began going by Bess rather than Bessie.

== Marriage and family ==
Harry S. Truman met Bess soon after his family moved to Independence in 1890, and the two attended school together until graduation. Many factors kept them from forming a closer bond in school, including their differences in social class and religion, Harry&#x27;s time-consuming job at a drugstore, and Harry&#x27;s inability to participate in athletics with Bess due to his thick glasses.They sometimes studied Latin together, and he often volunteered to carry her books, but they did not become close friends.

Bess had many suitors in the years after high school, but none won her love. In 1910, long after their time in school, Harry volunteered to return a cake plate to the Wallaces as an excuse to speak to Bess. They reconnected and began a courtship. Harry was insecure about his lack of money, and he attempted to impress Bess by purchasing tickets to shows and building her a tennis court. Bess&#x27; mother disapproved of the relationship.

Harry proposed in 1911 in a long letter, which he later admitted was clumsily written, but Bess turned him down. He later said that he intended to propose again when he would be earning more money than a farmer. They became informally engaged in November 1913, though Harry still doubted himself regarding his finances. Over the following years, the couple regularly corresponded while Harry traveled throughout the United States for his work in mining and petroleum. Bess wished to marry before Harry departed to fight in World War I in 1917, but he refused to risk making her a young widow. She worked to support the war effort while he was gone by selling war bonds, and she served on a committee for entertaining soldiers.

Bess and Harry married on June 28, 1919, at Trinity Episcopal Church in Independence. The newlyweds honeymooned in Chicago and Detroit and then moved into Bess&#x27;s childhood home so she could care for her mother. During their marriage, Bess tried in vain to teach her husband the etiquette with which she had been raised. Their only child, Margaret, was born in 1924. Bess&#x27;s two previous pregnancies had ended in miscarriages. Bess became the primary authority figure in Margaret&#x27;s life, while Harry would spoil her.

Bess held several jobs working with her husband, which provided more income for the Truman family. She was accounts manager at Truman-Jacobsen Haberdashery from 1919 to 1922, when the business went bankrupt. After Harry was elected county judge in the eastern district of Jackson County, she worked as his aide from 1922 to 1924 and from 1926 to 1934. Corruption and violence were prominent in Jackson County politics at the time, and working with her husband in his early political career caused her great distress, including when they feared a plot to kidnap their young daughter. In addition to helping Harry in his political work, Bess also managed the family&#x27;s household and finances. As part of her social life, Bess helped found the Junior Service League of Independence and a chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

== Move to Washington, D.C. ==
When Harry was elected as a senator from Missouri in 1934, Bess stayed in Missouri with her mother for the first year. After visiting Harry, she decided to stay, and the family moved to Washington, D.C. While Congress was in session during the first half of each year, they would live in rented apartments in Washington. When the session ended, they would return to Independence for the rest of the year. While her husband was in the Senate, Bess became a member of the Congressional Club, the P.E.O. Sisterhood, the H Street United Service Organization, and the Red Cross work of the group informally known as the &quot;Senate Wives&quot;. She joined her husband&#x27;s staff as a clerk, answering personal mail and editing committee reports when he became chairman of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program. She developed relationships with the wives of senators and cabinet members, though she did not attend meetings of senators&#x27; wives, as she found them boring. During her husband&#x27;s political career, she helped him write his speeches, though she refused to give any of her own.

In 1944, Harry was offered the Democratic nomination for Vice President of the United States. He had not sought the position, and it was a surprise to the Trumans when it was offered. When the position had previously been suggested to him, he had dismissed the idea out of concern for Bess and Margaret. When Harry accepted the role of vice president to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bess was not entirely pleased. She wanted to return to their life in Missouri, and she also feared that Roosevelt would die, which would make her husband the president. Bess&#x27;s position on Harry&#x27;s staff was controversial during the campaign, but he retained her during the campaign and during his vice presidency. After the Democratic ticket won the election and Harry was sworn in as vice president, Bess became Second Lady of the United States. She found herself saddled with the associated social responsibilities, attending many events as a representative of the Roosevelts, often multiple times in one day. Bess served as second lady for 82 days before President Roosevelt died and her husband ascended to the presidency.

== First Lady of the United States ==

=== Social role ===
President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, immediately making Harry Truman the president of the United States and Bess Truman the first lady of the United States. Bess reportedly wept when she first heard the news. After making arrangements for her mother, Bess&#x27; first act as first lady was to give her condolences to the widowed Eleanor Roosevelt shortly before attending her husband&#x27;s inauguration. They moved into Blair House on April 16, allowing Eleanor time to vacate the White House, and they occupied the White House on May 7. Bess had only limited social responsibilities during her first months as first lady, as the nation was in the midst of World War II and in mourning of President Roosevelt. She stayed in the White House until the end of the month before making her first return trip to Independence.

After the end of World War II, Bess was responsible for restoring the White House social season, and she organized the White House&#x27;s receptions and events. She was inspired by the history of the White House and that of the Monroe administration in particular. She chose to host a more limited social season in response to postwar food shortages, replacing large dinners with informal luncheons. She emphasized courteousness and respect for all of her guests, including political opponents and others that she disliked. Bess received about one hundred letters each day, and she spent much time replying to each one. She also maintained some social obligations in Washington society, including regular attendance of luncheons in her honor.

Bess felt great anxiety at public events and wished to avoid being the center of attention. She underwent a humiliating experience a few weeks into her tenure as first lady when she was asked to christen airplanes by striking champagne bottles against them. The first bottle had not been scored to allow for an easy break, causing Bess to ineffectually strike the bottle against the plane&#x27;s hull several times amid a crowd of spectators and reporters. Harry would tease her about this event, and she would eventually join the family in laughing at the footage.

Bess found the White House&#x27;s lack of privacy distasteful. As her husband put it later, she was &quot;not especially interested&quot; in the &quot;formalities and pomp or the artificiality&quot; that surrounded the presidential family. Though she steadfastly fulfilled the social obligations of her position, she did only what she thought was necessary. She resisted any changes to her lifestyle, often handling bookkeeping, dusting, and other chores on her own, though she did enjoy having domestic servants. She dressed simply, preferring conservative gowns and suits rather than more elaborate dresses. When the White House was rebuilt during Harry&#x27;s second term, the family lived in Blair House and kept their social life to a minimum. The responsibility of finding new venues for larger events fell to Bess.

=== Press relations ===
The contrast with Bess&#x27;s activist predecessor Eleanor Roosevelt was considerable. Unlike Roosevelt, Bess held only one press conference after many requests from the media. Inquiries to the first lady consisted of written questions in advance and the written replies were mostly monosyllabic along with many &quot;no comments&quot;. When asked why she did not want to give press conferences she replied &quot;I am not the one who is elected. I have nothing to say to the public.&quot; Bess did not support advancing women&#x27;s role in politics, and she believed that there would never be a woman president. She is quoted as saying that a woman&#x27;s role in public is to &quot;sit beside her husband, be silent, and make sure her hat is on straight&quot;. Bess&#x27;s response to whether she wanted her daughter Margaret to become president was &quot;most definitely not.&quot; Her reply to what she wanted to do after her husband left office was &quot;return to Independence&quot;.

Bess maintained a limited association with women journalists on the advice of her husband&#x27;s press secretary, but she did not provide them with information. She did allow reporters to have mimeographed copies of her schedule, becoming the first first lady to do so. Part of the reason for her reclusive behavior may have been a fear that her father&#x27;s suicide would be publicized, though it would not be public knowledge until after her death. Press briefings would often be given on Bess&#x27; behalf by her social secretary Edith Benham Helm and personal secretary Reathel Odum. Her limited interaction with the media surprised many journalists who had grown accustomed to regular coverage of her predecessor. Others approved of her behavior, feeling that her predecessor had overstepped in the role of first lady.

=== Political influence ===
Privately, Bess was an unofficial advisor to her husband. She never told him what to do as president, but she often offered her opinion on matters he was unsure of. Bess would also assist Harry with his speeches, including his speech on the Truman Doctrine. In addition to speeches, Bess reviewed and commented on Harry&#x27;s work at the end of every day, and played an influential role in his 1948 campaign. Harry would later say that he asked her input on major issues, including the Marshall Plan and entry into the Korean War. Many of Bess&#x27; ideas became government initiatives, including the use of theatrical companies abroad to improve foreign relations and the involvement of the National Institutes of Health in an effort to combat disease. She was also the one to suggest appointing Charlie Ross as the White House Press Secretary.

Bess was involved with a controversy while she was first lady in attending a reception for the Daughters of the American Revolution. The organization had refused to allow Hazel Scott, a black pianist, to perform at DAR Constitution Hall, and Bess&#x27; attendance was seen as an endorsement of this stance. Scott&#x27;s husband, Representative Adam Clayton Powell, was banned from the White House after calling Bess the &quot;Last Lady of the Land&quot;. Bess caused a similar controversy when she attended a play at George Washington University despite an ongoing protest of the ban on black audience members. Bess felt that a first lady&#x27;s actions should not address political issues, and she considered her personal time to be entirely separate from her political role. She was upset with being compared to segregationists, furthering her resolve to avoid the public for the rest of her husband&#x27;s presidency.

As First Lady, Bess served as Honorary President of the Girl Scouts, the Woman&#x27;s National Democratic Club, and the Washington Animal Rescue League. She was Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross. She worked with various organizations, but she never adopted a group or cause to focus on, as many First Ladies do. She was active in her husband&#x27;s reelection campaign in 1948, traveling the country with Harry in a whistle-stop train tour in which he introduced her to crowds as his &quot;Boss&quot;. Her presence, along with that of her daughter, contributed to Harry&#x27;s image as a family man. She also sat in on and contributed to meetings among his advisors. Four years later, when Harry was uncertain about another reelection campaign, Bess&#x27; desire to return home was a major factor in his decision not to run. When Harry announced that he would not run for reelection in 1952, one of Bess&#x27; friends described her as trying not to show how gleeful she was. After her retirement, however, she would say that she enjoyed the culture and political happenings of Washington.

=== Personal life ===
Despite criticism of her regular absences from Washington, she spent a significant amount of time as first lady in Independence. Bess allowed her daughter to fulfill the social responsibilities of the first lady during her absences. Even when she was in Washington, most of her time was dedicated to her family. She continued to care for her mother until the latter&#x27;s death in 1952. When Bess was in Washington, she held a weekly Spanish language class for her and her local friends. She also hosted her bridge club from home in Independence, bringing them out to the White House and leading them on a tour of Washington.

During the first months of her husband&#x27;s presidency, Bess felt neglected. She made Harry aware of these feelings, but his schedule prevented them from spending as much time together as they were accustomed to. This caused a great argument between the couple in December 1945 after Harry arrived for Christmas. After returning to Washington, he wrote her a harshly worded letter only to call Margaret and have her burn it before Bess could read it. The couple reconciled after this incident, and Harry ensured that she had an increased role in his administration. White House staff and visitors often described the Trumans as a close family. Their close relationship as a family was apparent such that the staff affectionately dubbed Harry, Bess, and Margaret the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;.

== Later life ==
After leaving the White House in 1953, the Trumans went back to Independence and the family home at 219 North Delaware Street, where the former president worked on building his library and writing his memoirs. Upon arriving home, they were met with a large crowd of admirers, which Bess thoroughly enjoyed. In 1955, the Trumans went on vacation at a resort owned by Edwin W. Pauley in Coconut Island, Hawaii. That summer, they went on a road trip across the continental United States, but they were impeded by the attention they received everywhere they went.

The Trumans toured Europe in 1956 and again in 1958. Bess fully recovered following a 1959 mastectomy in which doctors removed a large, but benign, tumor. The Trumans made their first return to the White House in 1961 on the invitation of the Kennedys. When President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into law in 1965, the Trumans were the first senior citizens to receive Medicare cards, presented to them by Johnson at the Truman Library. At the time of her husband&#x27;s death in December 1972, at age 88, she was 87, making them the oldest couple to have occupied the White House up to that time.

Bess was dismayed in the 1972 presidential election, as she opposed the left-wing policies of 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern, and she felt that Thomas Eagleton had been unfairly treated when he was removed from the 1972 Democratic ticket. She agreed to be the honorary chairman of Eagleton&#x27;s Senate reelection campaign in 1974, and she held a similar position for Stuart Symington in 1976. She also supported Congressional candidate Ike Skelton due to the close relations of their families. While Harry&#x27;s presidency had been heavily scrutinized after leaving office, Bess lived long enough to see a historical reassessment in the 1970s that portrayed him in a more positive light. Jimmy Carter sought her endorsement in the 1980 presidential election, though he did not receive it.

Bess continued to live quietly in Independence for the last decade of her life, being visited by her daughter and grandchildren. She received many visitors in Independence, sometimes upwards of a hundred in one week, and she often demonstrated a keen memory for names and details about people she had met in the past. Arthritis necessitated that she use a wheelchair in her final years, and she continued in her less active hobbies, reading mystery novels and closely following the Kansas City Royals. She would also reread an old love letter from her husband every day.

Bess died on October 18, 1982, from congestive heart failure at the age of 97, and a private funeral service was held on October 21. Afterwards, she was buried beside her husband in the courtyard of the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence, Missouri. She remains the longest-lived first lady in United States history at 97, followed by Rosalynn Carter at 96, Nancy Reagan and Lady Bird Johnson at 94, Betty Ford at 93, and Barbara Bush at 92. Truman is also the longest lived second lady in United States history.

== Legacy ==
Truman kept a low profile during her tenure as first lady, and commentators often emphasized how little was known about her. Many contemporary reports about her contained inaccuracies and misrepresentations based on the very little that reporters could glean. Her refusal to discuss her political beliefs led the public to believe that she had no strong opinions of her own.Bess destroyed many of her own letters after leaving the White House with the intention of making historical analysis of her life more difficult. Most of her surviving correspondences are those that were preserved by her daughter. She made only one television appearance, also on the initiative of her daughter. Much of the historic record about Bess is derived from a biography written by her daughter and letters written to her by Harry. For this reason, historical analysis of Bess Truman varies considerably. Siena Research Institute polling ranked her as the 11th best out of 37 first ladies in 1993, but its subsequent edition in 2003 ranked her as 20th best out of 38.

She was often contrasted with her predecessor, Eleanor Roosevelt. While Roosevelt was active in politics and an influential public figure, Bess&#x27; influence was largely felt behind the scenes at the White House. She would chide her husband when he lost his temper, to the point where her &quot;you didn&#x27;t have to say that&quot; became an inside joke among the White House staff. Bess was popular among the staff, with whom she enjoyed friendly relations in contrast to her shy personality in public. Her input may have influenced her husband&#x27;s decision making, but the extent of her role is lost to history.

<text>Grace Anna Coolidge (née Goodhue; January 3, 1879 – July 8, 1957) was the first lady of the United States from 1923 to 1929 as the wife of the 30th president of the United States, Calvin Coolidge. She was previously the second lady of the United States from 1921 to 1923 and the first lady of Massachusetts from 1919 to 1921.

Grace was raised in Burlington, Vermont, and attended the University of Vermont where she co-founded the school&#x27;s chapter of Pi Beta Phi. Inspired by a neighbor, Grace moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, to teach at Clarke School for the Deaf. She met Calvin Coolidge in Northampton before marrying him in 1905, and they had two sons together. Grace stayed in Northampton to raise their children while Calvin&#x27;s political career progressed in Boston. They moved to Washington, D.C. when Calvin was elected vice president in 1921, and into the White House after the death of Warren G. Harding ascended Calvin to the presidency in 1923.

Grace was active as first lady, hosting thousands of guests each year, and she made regular public appearances in the president&#x27;s stead. She was highly regarded for her charm, and the public saw her as a relatable figure. Grace distanced herself from the politically active first ladies that preceded her, though she took quieter interest in helping women&#x27;s groups and the deaf. She felt restricted by the role of first lady; she believed that it took priority over her own interests, and she was subject to many rules imposed on her by her husband to avoid controversy. She was especially affected by the death of her younger son in 1924, though she interrupted her duties as White House hostess for only a few weeks. In the final year of her tenure, Grace was afflicted with kidney disease which left her temporarily debilitated.

The Coolidges returned to Northampton in 1929, where Grace began writing poetry and autobiographical essays. Following Calvin&#x27;s death in 1933, she became more independent and began traveling with a feminist woman named Florence Adams. Grace was an advocate of American involvement in World War II, and she lent her house to WAVES after the U.S. entered the war. She remained active on the board of Clarke School and programs for the deaf until her death in 1957.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
Grace Anna Goodhue was born in Burlington, Vermont, on January 3, 1879, as the only child of Andrew Issachar Goodhue and Lemira Barrett Goodhue. Through her father, she was descended from the Goodhue family descended from the 1635 colonist William Goodhue. Each summer, she joined all of the Goodhues for a family reunion in Hancock, New Hampshire, until 1899 when the last of the Goodhue grandparents died. She also visited her maternal grandfather in the summers where she listened to his stories of the Civil War. Grace was close to her mother as a child, following her where she went and taking up the same household chores like sewing.

Grace&#x27;s father was an engineer at a mill, and the family rented a house from his employer. Then in the early 1880s, her father built them a new home near the mill at 123 Maple Street. He made the house a luxurious one by installing several desirable features: a bathtub of tin and wood, a furnace that heated the entire home, and electric lights. With the exception of a spinal problem that was treated through exercise, Grace faced little adversity during her childhood.

When Grace&#x27;s father was injured in a work accident in 1886, she stayed with their neighbors, the Yale family. Here she bonded with their adult daughter, June Yale. June began teaching at the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts, and she sometimes brought students to Vermont in the summers. By her teenage years, Grace was helping June care for them.

Grace&#x27;s father left the mill after his accident and co-founded a machine shop. He was a Democrat, and with this experience he was appointed by Democratic President Grover Cleveland as a steamboat inspector later in 1886. This brought money and status to the family in their small town. Grace had a deeply religious upbringing, raised on Puritan values and spending most of the family&#x27;s social outings at church events. The family was Methodist until she was a teenager, when she convinced them to convert to Congregationalism. Andrew built a new home for the family at 312 Maple Street in 1899.

=== Education ===
Grace attended Burlington High School, where she studied Latin and French. She also received private lessons in piano, speech, and singing. She spoke at her school&#x27;s commencement in 1897, delivering a speech she titled &quot;Tramp Instinct&quot;.

Grace enrolled at the University of Vermont in 1897, but she dropped out that November because of an eye condition, only returning to the school the following year. She took little interest in her academics. Instead, Grace was involved with several activities in and out of the university, including dance, skating, tobogganing, sleighing, theater, Bible class, Christian Endeavor, and poetry. She also joined the glee club where she performed as a contralto, and she became her class&#x27;s vice president in her sophomore year. Grace gained a reputation for being likeable and outgoing, and she was courted by several men over the course of her schooling. Her most serious relationship was with a man named Frank Joyner. Despite her family&#x27;s reservations about Joyner, the two had an informal agreement that they would wed. Despite the prevailing opinion at the time that rotundness was an attractive trait, Grace was insecure about her weight and restricted her diet.

Noticing a lonely-looking woman on the University of Vermont campus, Grace befriended Ivah Gale. Gale eventually moved into the Goodhue home where she shared a bedroom with Grace. The two women were among those who co-founded the university&#x27;s chapter of Pi Beta Phi, a women&#x27;s fraternity. The group held its meetings in Grace&#x27;s home. In 1901, Grace traveled to Syracuse, New York, to attend the fraternity&#x27;s national convention. She graduated from the University of Vermont the following year.

Once Grace graduated from university, she decided to teach at Clarke School for the Deaf. She wrote to the school&#x27;s principal, June Yale&#x27;s aunt Caroline Yale, about training as an instructor for the deaf. She moved to Northampton where she taught at the school for three years, first instructing the primary school children before working with middle school students. Grace&#x27;s mother opposed the decision, wishing that Grace would be a teacher at a local school. Rather than teaching sign language, Grace followed the school&#x27;s philosophy of instructing the students in lip reading.

== Marriage and family ==
Grace met Calvin Coolidge in her second year at Northampton. While watering flowers outside of the dormitory, she first saw the young man through a window across from the school, where he was shaving wearing only long underwear and a derby hat. Calvin noticed her when she laughed, and he subsequently asked his landlord, the school&#x27;s steward Robert Weir, to introduce them. Wier set them up to both appear at a mutual friend&#x27;s house. Joking about Calvin&#x27;s reserved nature, he commented that if Grace could teach the deaf to hear, then she could perhaps teach the mute to speak. Grace had kept in touch with her previous suitor, Frank Joyner, but she ended the relationship with him. Grace and Calvin subsequently began a romantic relationship.

Calvin, active in local politics, took her to a Republican Party event at city hall for their first date. From then on, he could be found accompanying her to all of her picnics and dances, though he did not participate himself. To those around them their relationship was defined by their contrasting personalities, as Calvin was quiet and reserved as opposed to her more outgoing demeanor. Despite this, they bonded over several shared qualities: their background as college educated Vermonters, mischievous sense of humor, religious sensibilities, and feelings of idealism and public service. The two frequently exchanged playful remarks targeting one another, often focused on Grace&#x27;s cooking and Calvin&#x27;s quietude, respectively. He welcomed her nasally impression of him. She got along well with Calvin&#x27;s family and had their approval. Grace had her friend Ivah Gale take a three hour buggy ride with Calvin, so Gale could form her own opinion on the man. Calvin said nothing during the trip, but Gale supported the couple such that she said they had got along well.

The first time Calvin met Grace&#x27;s parents, he asked permission to marry her. He proposed to Grace in 1905 by telling her &quot;I am going to be married to you&quot;. Grace&#x27;s mother was not fond of Calvin and sought to delay the wedding, but Calvin stood firm on a date no later than October. The couple married in the parlor of the Goodhue family&#x27;s home on October 4, 1905, with fifteen guests in attendance. The newlyweds took a short honeymoon in Montreal, but time was limited as Calvin had to return to Northampton to run as a candidate for the school board. They first lived in the Norwood Hotel for three weeks before staying in a home owned by a professor at Smith College. They moved to their long-term home at 21 Massasoit Street in 1906. The Coolidges had very little money in these early years of their marriage, but Grace was often the recipient of desirable clothes and hats as gifts from her husband. She otherwise made her own clothes. When the Norwood Hotel closed, they purchased some of its branded linen and silverware for their own use.

Grace had two sons: John Coolidge on September 7, 1906, and Calvin Coolidge Jr. on April 13, 1908. She was their sole caretaker. Calvin was elected to the Massachusetts legislature shortly after their first son was born, so he spent much of his time in the state capital, Boston. They felt it was important not to let Calvin&#x27;s career be a burden on the children, so the rest of the family stayed in Northampton and Calvin returned home on the weekends. Even when he was home, Calvin had Grace address the needs of their children. She engaged them in activities traditionally associated with the father, teaching them baseball and constructing wooden cars for them to ride in. She had little involvement in his professional life, and made no attempt to be present for it after he asked her not to join him when he was giving a speech at their church.

Calvin left the state legislature and returned to Northampton in 1909. He became mayor the following year, giving him a job that let him return to his family each night. He was elected to the state legislature again in 1911 and went back to Boston. Grace was a regular participant in church activities while Calvin was away and attended card parties with her friends, where she sewed while the others played. She visited Washington, D.C. for the first time in 1912 when she chaperoned a trip for students of Northampton High School. She is quoted as saying that she would one day return to the White House to play its piano, after a guard rebutted her attempt to do so. Calvin Jr was diagnosed with emphysema the following year, necessitating an operation. When World War I began, Grace worked with the other women in the community to conduct bond drives and support Red Cross, where she became co-chair of the Women&#x27;s War Committee of Northampton.

== Entering political life ==

Grace ascended in her own political career within the ranks of Pi Beta Phi. She became president of the Western Massachusetts Alumnae Club in 1910, vice president of the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha Province covering the entire East Coast in 1912, and president of the Alpha Province in 1915. She went on a tour of California for Pi Beta Phi that year, but her trip ended early when she received a telegram informing her that Calvin was a candidate for lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Her return home was then delayed when her mother fell ill and Grace went to see her in Burlington.

Calvin was inaugurated as lieutenant governor on January 6, 1916. That same year, the couple joined Calvin&#x27;s political ally Frank Stearns and his wife Emily Clark Stearns on a trip to Washington D.C. The Coolidges took on a housekeeper, Alice Reckahn, who stayed with them for decades. Grace began working with Red Cross and co-chaired Northampton&#x27;s women&#x27;s war committee when the United States entered World War I.

After three years as lieutenant governor, Calvin was elected governor of Massachusetts in 1918. Despite being the governor&#x27;s wife, Grace refused to move to Boston full time, choosing to stay with her sons in Northampton, which caused some displeasure in the state. She instead made periodic trips to the city. Calvin had little time for Grace while he was governor, rarely visiting her in Northampton and sometimes having a staff member accompany her on his behalf while she visited in Boston. While staying in Boston, Grace joined her husband in his cramped room at the Adams House Hotel on Washington Street, which was expanded to two rooms so she could host guests. She was responsible for entertaining in the capital at times and became popular among guests despite her lack of experience as a hostess.

Grace supported Calvin&#x27;s decision to accept the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination to be vice president of the United States in 1920 as the running mate of Warren G. Harding, though she felt that he should accept nothing short of the presidential nomination. After he accepted, Grace wrote a hundred letters of thanks for those who congratulated him. The Republican ticket won, and Calvin became vice president in 1921. Grace moved to Washington D.C. with him and enrolled their sons in boarding school at Mercersburg Academy. Grace and Calvin moved into a suite on the top floor of the Willard Hotel.

== Second lady of the United States ==

Being second lady of the United States presented Grace with a larger national profile. She began appearing at ceremonial events with Calvin, and her entertaining duties became much greater than they had been when she was the wife of a governor. Grace received guests at her home each week, sometimes in numbers well beyond her capacity to address them all. She also made weekly calls to the wives of many important figures in Washington. To alleviate her responsibilities, she hired a part-time secretary, and Calvin made a point of setting deadlines for their attendance at events so they could end their day early.

Lois Irene Marshall and Emily Clark Stearns, the previous second lady and the wife of Calvin&#x27;s political ally, respectively, both became mentors for Grace as she acclimated to her new role. On her first night as second lady, Grace dined with the celebrated general John J. Pershing and the two bonded over their experiences as parents. Grace was president of the Senate Wives Club as second lady, and through this she continued her activity supporting the Red Cross. She also began taking dancing classes, though Calvin asked that she not be seen dancing in public and risk controversy. Her attendance at the dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier left an impression on her in 1921, especially during the moment of silence.

The Hardings were not fond of the Coolidges. The first lady, Florence Harding, resented Grace&#x27;s youth and popularity. Grace became responsible for Florence&#x27;s hosting duties for a period of time in late 1922, after the first lady fell ill with life-threatening nephritis. The Coolidges were on a trip to Calvin&#x27;s family home in Vermont when they received news that President Harding had died. Grace wept upon hearing the news and then prayed alongside her husband. She became first lady of the United States on August 2, 1923.

== First lady of the United States ==
=== White House hostess ===

The Coolidges were one of the most socially active families in the White House&#x27;s history, entertaining many guests each day. Her public receptions brought a total of 20,000 to 25,000 people to the White House annually. In addition to her normal hosting duties, she held exclusive high teas in the Red Room, which replaced the brief one-on-one meetings that Florence Harding had with guests as Grace felt excluded too many people. She felt that as first lady she should invite as many guests as possible so that everyone had an opportunity to meet with her. Grace was responsible for a large staff, including eighteen servants, a valet, a maid, and other cleaning staff. Among them, she was known as &quot;Sunshine&quot;. Besides hosting, Grace&#x27;s only daily responsibility was to arrange flowers for her bedroom and the West Sitting Hall. Calvin insisted on organizing White House events and catering, freeing her from what was typically expected of the first lady.

Grace enjoyed meeting common people and preferred it over formal events. She especially found joy in her opportunities to work with children, including the White House egg rolling on Easter and on May Day celebrations. For Christmas 1923, Grace had the First Congregational Church choir and the Marine Band perform Christmas carols, and a new White House tradition was created when she invited watching passerby to come onto the lawn. She also held small musical events during Lent. Though she was personally unhappy with the effects of prohibition, her sense of legal obligation kept her from serving alcohol at the White House.

Grace wrote and received many letters, corresponding with her friends and the public. When she received gifts, she briefly kept them in her bedroom so she could send a reply saying she enjoyed them. Grace replied to much of her mail personally, though she was assisted by her secretary. She first worked with the Hardings&#x27; secretary Laura Harlan, but she gave the role to White House staff member Mary Randolph after Harlan&#x27;s departure in 1925. For her housekeeper, Grace fired Elizabeth Jaffray and replaced her with Ellen A. Riley. Having held the position since 1909, Jaffray had acted entitled to it and the authority it gave her. She retaliated by publishing a tell all, &quot;Secrets of the White House&quot;, which gave an unkind and misleading depiction of the Coolidges.

Washington society welcomed Grace&#x27;s unpretentious approach to her role as first lady, and she acted as a comforting presence for guests at receptions. She often saved face for her husband and his unusual social behavior. Grace&#x27;s love for music meant that popular musicians were a common sight at the White House, which helped with the image of the Coolidge administration. Many participated in Calvin&#x27;s reelection campaign in 1924. The pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff played for the White House many times during the Coolidge presidency. When Al Jolson appeared at the White House, Grace sang alongside him.

Among Grace&#x27;s more difficult guests was Queen Marie of Romania in October 1926. Known for her overpowering personality and love of media attention, the queen had to be constantly managed. Grace bonded with Marie over their shared experiences as mothers. She took to the queen&#x27;s young son Nicholas, who felt out of place at the event until Grace welcomed him and had him sit with her at dinner. This contrasted with a visit from John D. Rockefeller Jr. the next February, where Grace customized their menu and had high quality dishware brought in.

=== Public image ===

Grace took on much of the social responsibilities of the president, which Calvin saw as a distraction from his work, and she made regular appearances at public events and charity programs. She typically allowed her photo to be taken, leading to frequent appearances in the newspapers. On Calvin&#x27;s request, she refused any interviews that were asked of her. She once responded to a request by making her comments in sign language. She was careful not to speak over radio, despite the attempts of radio technicians to discreetly capture her voice whenever she stood near a microphone at a public event. When they were with company, Grace addressed Calvin as &quot;Mr. President&quot;.

The public primarily learned about the first lady through second-hand stories of her sociable demeanor. Anecdotes like her fascination with the 1925 solar eclipse and the Graf Zeppelin helped the public relate to her. When meeting with the public or political figures, she was aided by her ability to remember people&#x27;s names and facts about their lives. Grace became known for her love of sports, and her support for the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox earned her the moniker &quot;First Lady of Baseball&quot;. She was devoted to the baseball player Babe Ruth. Her interest in gardening also became known, and the &quot;Mrs. Coolidge rose&quot; was named after her.

Grace&#x27;s visibility as a college-educated woman made her into a symbol for women&#x27;s opportunities in universities. She then became the first of the first ladies to receive an honorary degree; she received an honorary LL.D. from Boston University in 1924. She then received an honorary degree from George Washington University alongside her husband in 1929.

While she was first lady, Grace was plagued by false rumors, including rumors that she intended to divorce Calvin and that she was pregnant. The former caused the couple to make more frequent appearances together in public, while the latter prompted many gifts in the form of baby clothes. The Coolidges refused to openly respond to the rumors. There were also rumors that Grace had become romantically involved with her Secret Service guard Jim Haley or that Calvin was jealous of the time they spent together. Years after leaving the White House, she determined that there was no point where she had genuinely embarrassed herself.

=== Personal life ===

Grace was delighted when she became first lady of the United States, but she soon felt constrained by her role and the expectations that came with it. She described a divide between her true self and the person she was in the role, saying that her &quot;personal likes and dislikes must be subordinated&quot; to the first ladyship. When she was not tending to her responsibilities, Grace spent her days shopping and taking walks that lasted for several miles. She also kept with her sewing and knitting, crafting some of her own dresses. She enjoyed the large residential quarters in the White House and decorated it to her liking.

To limit anything potentially controversial, Calvin strictly controlled Grace&#x27;s activities. After she received press coverage for going out horse-riding, he instructed her to &quot;not try anything new&quot;, and her personal projects were limited to the traditional role of the first lady to work with the Girl Scouts. He also asked her not to smoke in public, a rule which he had also imposed on himself. The new constraints on her time also burdened her. She often did not know her own schedule, being told shortly beforehand whether she was to accompany her husband to an event or that he had scheduled an appearance for her. Adding to her stress, the weather in Washington caused problems with her sinuses.

Grace had a penchant for animals and used her time in the White House to gather several pets, including several dogs and birds. The family&#x27;s white collies, Rob Roy and Prudence Prim, were the most popular among the public. For her closer friends, she left calling cards on behalf of her dog in addition to her own. Grace received several wild animals as gifts and had them sent to live in the zoo, but she kept a raccoon, Rebecca. Despite the Coolidge&#x27;s adoration for the raccoon, Rebecca wreaked havoc on the White House and scared the staff, and she too was sent to live at the zoo.

The Coolidges always dined with guests or people staying at the White House during afternoon and evening meals, but each morning Grace and Calvin ate breakfast privately in their bedroom. Through her role, Grace became friends with figures like Alice Roosevelt Longworth and William Howard Taft. When Longworth discovered she was pregnant, Grace was the first person she told outside of her family. The Coolidges spent many of their weekends on the presidential yacht. During Calvin&#x27;s presidency, the family vacationed in Massachusetts, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin. They also made occasional trips to attend events in New York City. Grace enjoyed attending film and theater events and was a common sight at the National Theatre. In some cases, she sat among the audience instead of in a bad. Grace was also the first of the first ladies to listen to the radio in the White House. In early 1924, Calvin Jr. taught his mother how to swim. According to Ike Hoover, the White House Chief Usher, Grace was the first first lady to try a cigarette.

The Coolidges were devastated by the sudden death of their son Calvin Jr. on July 7, 1924. He developed a blister on his foot while playing tennis a few days before, which caused lethal blood poisoning. Grace stopped hosting at the White House for several weeks while she grieved. Grace and Calvin became emotionally distant as neither were comfortable expressing their grief. To ease her pain, Grace looked to religion, and she took up poetry. Each day, she placed one rose in a vase beside his photograph and one on his bed. She invited people they knew to comfort them at the White House, including her father-in-law as well as Alice Roosevelt Longworth with her infant child.

Grace attended the farewell party for C. Bascom Slemp, her husband&#x27;s presidential secretary, at the onset of Calvin&#x27;s second term. Slemp requested her presence specifically at an event where there were otherwise no women. In 1925, the Coolidges established a Summer White House in Swampscott, Massachusetts. She chose the location, but she regretted her selection when Calvin did not take to it. Grace&#x27;s close relationship with her father-in-law was maintained until his death in March 1926, and her letters about the family&#x27;s goings on brought him comfort toward the end of his life. John became quite popular and frequently received invitations to parties by early 1927 when he was out of school for the winter, but Grace restricted her son&#x27;s activity knowing that these events could go until 5:00a.m.

=== Political activity ===

Grace kept away from politics and is not seen as having influenced Calvin&#x27;s political positions. She followed her husband&#x27;s request that she not express opinions publicly or speak to the press. Grace&#x27;s silence on political issues put the public at ease as she followed the more active first ladies Florence Harding, Edith Wilson, and Helen Herron Taft. She wrote only one formal publication during her tenure, producing an article on knitting for charity, donating $250 to the Home for Needy Confederate Women.

Although Grace&#x27;s popularity benefited her husband&#x27;s reelection campaign, she had minimal participation leading up to the 1924 presidential election as she was still grieving the death of her son. Her only solo campaign appearance was at the Montgomery County Maryland Women&#x27;s Republic Club, where she sat in the audience on September 19. She filled in her absentee ballot in front of the press on the White House lawn to encourage women to vote.

Despite her silence around politics, Grace subtly paid attention to current events by sitting in on budget meetings and attending Senate hearings regarding the Teapot Dome scandal. She took interest in the government&#x27;s involvement in the arts and got to know the chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore. When John J. Pershing brought a design for a war memorial to the president, she informed the general that it looked too much like a guillotine and that it should be returned to the architect for a different design. She also took interest in the passing of the Public Buildings Act of 1926. Grace once used her position to influence the Veterans&#x27; Bureau; when she discovered that her maid&#x27;s son had breathing problems from a gas attack in World War I, she had the bureau relocate him to the Western United States where clearer air would help his recovery.

The areas she was most active were children&#x27;s welfare and support for the deaf. She often invited deaf people, including students from Clarke School, to visit the White House. Helen Keller was also a frequent guest. The Coolidges did not engage in any outward advocacy for the cause of deaf children to avoid the appearance of favoring it, especially since both held board positions for groups supporting the deaf. The financial editor Clarence W. Barron encouraged the Coolidges to hold a fundraiser for Clark School in 1928. Without fanfare, Grace raised the most funds any first lady ever had for a cause, over $2 million, for the school.

Grace similarly invited women&#x27;s groups to the White House as she privately supported women&#x27;s causes, and she ensured that the wives of cabinet-members were seated as a distinct group during her husband&#x27;s first address to Congress. Privately, she supported the idea of a working woman though she herself preferred domestic life. She opposed the more radical aspects of the contemporary feminist movement such as the actions of Alice Paul. Publicly, Grace was more likely to speak about religion on the political stage, believing that it was an essential part of American society.

=== Renovation and vacation ===

To acquire new furniture for the White House, Grace had Congress approve a call for citizens to donate period pieces in 1925. This was largely unsuccessful, and she received only one piece of furniture. When the press discovered that she was to try again the following year, Calvin put an end to the idea. She acquired other historical pieces from the White House storerooms.

The White House underwent a significant period of restoration in 1927, so the Coolidges temporarily stayed at Dupont Circle. After the demolition began in March, Grace made frequent appearances at the White House to see the construction. While changes to the design of architect Charles Follen McKim would have caused backlash, the replacement of the roof gave Grace an opportunity to modify the attic and upper floors, which were separate from McKim&#x27;s work. Among the changes was a sunroom installed for her use. In her contribution to the refurbishing, she crocheted a bed cover for the Lincoln Bedroom. Separately, she was involved in expanding the White House gardens. In addition to a Vermont spruce tree she planted in her son&#x27;s memory, she had a birch tree and a lily pond added to the garden.

While at Dupont Circle, the Coolidges hosted Charles Lindbergh after his celebrated &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; trans-Atlantic flight. Grace declined his offer to fly in a plane with him, as one of Calvin&#x27;s rules was that she was not to fly in a plane while she was first lady. Lindbergh&#x27;s visit was a massive event with crowds gathered around the house to see him.

The Coolidges left Dupont Circle in June. From there, they visited the Black Hills in South Dakota. Here Grace and her Secret Service guard Jim Haley got lost on one of her walks when they misjudged the terrain. Calvin had Haley transferred away, depriving Grace from the rare walking partner who could keep up with her and causing rumors that the president was acting out of jealousy. This was the only time that Grace faced serious public embarrassment as first lady. Instead, Grace was assigned to Edmund W. Starling, and she was forbidden from leaving their cabin when Starling went fishing with Calvin. She stayed in contact with Haley and his wife without Calvin&#x27;s knowledge. They left for Washington in September.

Grace did not know about Calvin&#x27;s announcement in 1927 that he would not run for another until after he made it. While she was not aware that he made the announcement, she never said to others whether she was aware of his intention not to run. She was glad to hear the news. The decision was strongly influenced by the emotional divide that had grown between the Coolidges over the previous years and Calvin&#x27;s desire to mend it. The Coolidges took a trip to Cuba in January 1928 and met with President Gerardo Machado.

=== Illness and departure ===
Grace was afflicted with kidney disease in February 1928. This first became known when she collapsed after an especially strenuous reception. She was secretly taken to the National Naval Medical Center to receive x-rays and a cystoscopy, which revealed that it was discovered that her right kidney was enlarged, infected, obstructed, and out of place. Grace spent the following weeks in considerable pain. At its worst, Calvin feared that the illness would kill her. Grace stayed in her sky parlor as she slowly recovered, resenting the boredom and the rules imposed upon her by the doctors. Calvin&#x27;s own health also declined with a weak heart and severe asthma. Grace watched over the president&#x27;s activity to keep his health problems a secret from the press, and she advocated for him to have a lighter schedule. The Coolidges relocated to Brule, Wisconsin, for the summer to recuperate. They stayed here until September.

In the final months of Calvin&#x27;s presidency, they spent their time on Sapelo Island and in Mountain Lake, Florida. The Coolidges left the White House on March 4, 1929. After years of declining to speak over the radio, Grace finally took the microphone after Calvin broadcast his farewell address to deliver her own brief message: &quot;Good-bye, folks&quot;.

== Later life and death ==

The Coolidges initially returned to their Northampton home after Calvin&#x27;s presidency, but the following year they moved to a new home, The Beeches, for privacy just outside of the city. They also had a new house constructed by Calvin&#x27;s childhood home where they could spend their summers. The Coolidges traveled across the United States in 1930, visiting Mount Dora, Florida, and then New Orleans before going to California. Here they stayed at Hearst Castle with William Randolph Hearst, where Grace was at one point trapped in an elevator. Calvin refused Grace&#x27;s request to visit Europe, as he feared possible foreign policy implications.

Grace began writing poetry and descriptions of her time in Washington, publishing them in magazines. This included an article about her husband, &quot;The Real Calvin Coolidge&quot;. She wrote a poem about Calvin Jr. titled &quot;The Open Door&quot; on the fifth anniversary of his death. It was published in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; for $250 () and was positively received. She also appeared in a promotional film for the Christmas seals drive, in which she rang the bell of the Northampton Memorial Hall and recited a sentence for the camera. Grace received honorary degrees from Smith College in June 1929 and the University of Vermont in June 1930. She also received a medal from the National Institute of Social Sciences in 1931. Clarke School&#x27;s art building was named for her upon its completion in 1933.

Calvin died on January 5, 1933, and Grace was discomforted by her sudden independence. She took her husband&#x27;s place as trustee of Mercersburg Academy, Clarke School, and another local school. She then began breaking some of the rules he had set for her. She befriended the feminist Florence Adams at this time, who encouraged this new lifestyle. Grace bobbed her hair, and she began wearing hiking shorts and trousers. She learned how to drive a car, and in 1936 she flew in a plane with Governor John H. Trumbull. A false rumor spread that she was to marry Congressman Everett Sanders.

Grace spent her winters with Adams at Adams&#x27; vacation home in North Carolina. Grace made her final visit to Washington in December 1934, where she and Adams saw the Works Projects Administration constructing new government buildings and visited the first ladies&#x27; gowns collection in the Smithsonian Institution. In 1936, they went on a six-month tour of Europe. In total, the pair drove across ten countries. When they returned, Grace sold The Beeches and had Road Forks, a house in Northampton, built for her. The pair regularly listened to baseball games over the radio, and on occasion they drove to Boston for a game with their friend Joseph D. Collins.

Grace became more politically active later in life. She helped campaign for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in the 1932 election. She was not entirely opposed to Franklin D. Roosevelt during his presidency, though she did not speak publicly on the matter. Grace became board president of Clarke School in 1935. She was active in the role, directly working with classrooms and keeping up with research related to hearing aids.

Grace supported American involvement in World War II, and in 1939 she began raising funds for child refugees from Germany. When the U.S. entered the war, she offered support to Red Cross and WAVES. She lent Road Forks to WAVES&#x27; Captain Herbert W. Underwood as the organization was operating out of the nearby Smith College. Grace lived with Adams in the meantime. She also volunteered as a civil defense watcher where each week she spent three hours as a look out for a possible German bombing of the United States, though none ever occurred.

Ivah Gale, Grace&#x27;s long-time friend, lived with her off-and-on at Road Forks beginning in 1946. Grace&#x27;s tenure as board president of Clarke School ended in 1952, and she remained on the board as a member for the remainder of her life. She was afflicted by heart problems later in life, and her health declined in 1954. Though she was no longer healthy enough to visit Clarke School, the president and principal continued working with her to develop school programs. Grace died on July 8, 1957.

== Legacy ==

Grace&#x27;s legacy as first lady is most associated with her charm and cheerfulness. By the time she was second lady, Grace had already become one of the most popular social figures in the history of Washington D.C. This was unusual for what was typically a less important role in Washington society. Her relative youth, photogenic appearance, and fashion sense brought a revitalization to the role of the first lady, although she kept a reserved appearance at her husband&#x27;s request. Journalists characterized her as &quot;the college type of woman&quot;. Her popularity invited comparisons to former first ladies Frances Cleveland and Dolley Madison. Although Grace was more active later in her life, this has received relatively little scholarly attention.

Correspondences and other papers from Grace&#x27;s life have been kept by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Library, the Coolidge Foundation, and the Vermont Historical Society. Lawrence E. Wikander and Robert Hugh Ferrell published a collection of her papers and autobiographical writings titled &quot;Grace Coolidge: An Autobiography&quot;in 1992. The first major biography about her was &quot;Grace Coolidge and Her Era: The Story of a President&#x27;s Wife&quot; written by Ishbel Ross and published in 1962. The book was written in part using direct accounts from Grace&#x27;s son John Coolidge, her daughter-in-law Florence Coolidge, and her friends Florence Adams and Ivah Gale. Cynthia Bittinger of the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation released &quot;Grace Coolidge: Sudden Star&quot; in 2005, and Robert Hugh Ferrell released &quot;Grace Coolidge: The People&#x27;s Lady in Silent Cal&#x27;s White House&quot; in 2008.

Positive appraisals were made by the press, with laudatory profiles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; among other publications. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as being among the &quot;most photographed persons on earth outside of movieland&quot; in 1928. After meeting Grace, the humorist Will Rogers described her as &quot;Public Female Favorite No. 1&quot;. She was generally seen as a more domestic figure in contrast to the active feminist movement of the day.

Grace&#x27;s fashion influenced popular trends in the 1920s, especially in her choice of headwear, and she tried to present a modest approach to the styles of the time. When knee-length skirts were common apparel, Grace wore longer skirts and gowns that were at most 10.5inches from the ground. First lady biographer Betty Boyd Caroli said that Grace &quot;epitomized current flapper style&quot;. Calvin admired his wife&#x27;s appearance and took an interest in her wardrobe. He often helped her pick dresses to wear during events and went clothes shopping with her. The otherwise frugal man imposed no budget for her clothes. Despite Calvin&#x27;s preference for picture hats, Grace eventually adopted the style of short, close-fitting hats of the 1920s. Each dress she wore as first lady was scrutinized by the press. The attention on her clothing influenced the importance of fashion for future first ladies and their role in setting fashion trends.

Howard Chandler Christy painted Grace&#x27;s portrait in 1924, depicting her in a red dress alongside her white collie Rob Roy. This was done on the initiative of Pi Beta Phi, which had funded the project to accompany Calvin&#x27;s official painting. The painting hung in the China Room until it was moved to the Red Room by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The red dress in the painting reinforced an association of Grace with the color. Another painting of Grace was done by Christy depicting her in white.

Historians have debated how much Grace affected Calvin&#x27;s political career. Biographers Robert Hugh Ferrell and Kristie Miller attribute her presence as a reason for his success, describing her personality as a necessary balance to Calvin&#x27;s reservedness that may have otherwise lost him support. Ferrell also cited her ability to provide Calvin a calm home-life without arguments or marital problems. Calvin was quick to anger, and she was often the one tasked with de-escalating him. Her biographer Ishbel Ross emphasized their devotion to one another and their shared sense of humor, though she also cast doubt on Grace&#x27;s happy acceptance of the rules her husband imposed on her. Biographers Paul Boller, Betty Boyd Caroli, and Carl Sferrazza Anthony expressed similar concerns. Contemporary observers, such as Gamaliel Bradford and William Allen White, commented that Calvin had an emotional dependence on Grace, which the president acknowledged. Multiple people who knew the Coolidges attested to Calvin&#x27;s devotion to Grace, with one friend saying that he &quot;worshiped&quot; her. At the same time, she believed that he looked down on her intellectually. Historians have given varied accounts regarding how happy she was in the relationship, and its exact nature remains disputed.

Many people close to the Coolidges felt that Grace benefited her husband. The suffragette Florence Jaffray Harriman considered her &quot;the administration&#x27;s greatest success&quot;. Vera Bloom, the daughter of Congressman Sol Bloom, said that Grace was worth one million dollars a year for the Republican Party. Calvin&#x27;s political backer Stearns credited Grace&#x27;s ability to quickly make friends and her decision to &quot;not meddle with&quot; Calvin&#x27;s political activity as assets. Secretary of Labor James J. Davis compared her management of the public to be on par with a campaign manager. Her involvement in child welfare, and her practice of traveling with the president, set precedents for succeeding first ladies. Grace&#x27;s popularity pushed the first ladyship into a more public-facing role, adding a new facet to the job that persisted through future generations of first ladies.

<text>James Charles Lehrer ( ; May 19, 1934 – January 23, 2020) was an American journalist, novelist, screenwriter, and playwright. He was the executive editor and a news anchor for the &quot;PBS News Hour&quot; on PBS and was known for his role as a debate moderator during U.S. presidential election campaigns, moderating twelve presidential debates between 1988 and 2012. Lehrer authored numerous fiction and non-fiction books that drew upon his experience as a newsman, along with his interests in history and politics.

== Early life and education==
James Charles Lehrer was born on May 19, 1934, in Wichita, Kansas. His mother, Lois Catherine (), was a teacher and bank clerk, and his father, Harry Frederick Lehrer, was a bus station manager. His paternal grandparents were German immigrants. His maternal grandfather was J. B. Chapman, a prominent Church of the Nazarene figure. Jim had an older brother, Fred, who was a Baptist minister. He attended school in Wichita, middle school in Beaumont, Texas, and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio, where he was a sports editor for the &quot;Jefferson Declaration&quot;. He graduated with an associate degree from Victoria College, and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism from the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in 1956.

After graduating from college, Lehrer followed his father and older brother, and joined the United States Marine Corps serving for three years as an infantry officer in the late 1950s. He attributed his service and travels with helping him to look beyond himself and feel a connection to the world that he would not have otherwise experienced.

== Career ==
In 1959, Lehrer began his career in journalism at &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; in Texas. Later, he worked as a reporter for the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;, where he covered the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. He was a political columnist there for several years, and in 1968 he became the city editor.

Lehrer began his television career at KERA-TV in Dallas, Texas, as the executive director of Public Affairs, an on-air host, and editor of a nightly news program. In 1972, he moved to PBS in Washington, D.C., to become the Public Affairs Coordinator, a member of Journalism Advisory Board, and a Fellow at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). He worked as a correspondent for the National Public Affairs Center for Television (NPACT), where he met Robert MacNeil. In 1973, they covered the Senate Watergate hearings and the revelation of the Watergate Tapes broadcast, live on PBS (This coverage of the hearings would later help lead to and be the inspiration for what would eventually become &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer Report&quot;). Lehrer covered the House Judiciary Committee&#x27;s impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon.

In October 1975, Lehrer became the Washington correspondent for &quot;The Robert MacNeil Report&quot; on Thirteen/WNET New York. Two months later on December 1, 1975, he was promoted to co-anchor, and the program was accordingly renamed &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer Report&quot;. In September 1983, Lehrer and MacNeil relaunched their show as &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, which was renamed &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;, following MacNeil&#x27;s departure in 1995. The program was renamed the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; in 2009.

In order to maintain objectivity, Lehrer chose not to vote.

Lehrer underwent a heart valve surgery in April 2008, allowing Ray Suarez, Gwen Ifill, and Judy Woodruff to anchor in their stead until Lehrer&#x27;s return on June 26, 2008. He had recovered from a minor heart attack in 1983 when he was 49 years old.

Lehrer stepped down as anchor of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; on June 6, 2011, but continued to moderate the Friday news analysis segments and be involved with the show&#x27;s production company, MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.

Lehrer received several awards and honors during his career in journalism, including several Emmys; the George Foster Peabody Broadcast Award; a William Allen White Foundation Award for Journalistic Merit; and the University of Missouri School of Journalism&#x27;s Medal of Honor. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Journalism degree by McDaniel College.

== Presidential debate moderator ==
Lehrer was involved in several projects related to U.S. presidential debates, including the &quot;Debating Our Destiny&quot; documentaries in 2000 and 2008, which feature excerpts of exclusive interviews with many of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates since 1976. Nicknamed &quot;The Dean of Moderators&quot; by journalist Bernard Shaw, Lehrer moderated twelve presidential debates between 1988 and 2012. In 2016, Lehrer served on the board of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD).

The last debate that Lehrer moderated was the first general election debate of the 2012 election. He had originally sworn off moderating any debates after 2008; however, the CPD persisted, and he accepted as he was interested in the new format. The debate was held at the University of Denver and covered domestic policy issues. Lehrer&#x27;s performance as a moderator, in which he frequently allowed the candidates to exceed the given time limits, received mixed reviews; while he received criticism for his lenient enforcement of time rules and open-ended questions, his approach also received praise for letting the candidates have some control in the debate on their own terms.
== Personal life ==

For six decades until his death, Lehrer was married to Kate Lehrer, who is also a novelist. They had three daughters and six grandchildren. His father was a bus driver who briefly operated a bus company. Lehrer was an avid bus enthusiast, a hobbyist, and a collector of bus memorabilia, including depot signs, driver caps, and antique toy buses. As a college student in the 1950s, he worked as a Trailways ticket agent in Victoria, Texas. He also was a supporter of the Pacific Bus Museum in Fremont, California, and the Museum of Bus Transportation in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

Lehrer was a prolific writer and authored numerous novels, as well as several plays, screenplays, and three personal memoirs. His book, &quot;Top Down&quot;, is a novel based on the events surrounding the Kennedy assassination. His last play, &quot;Bell&quot;, was produced by the National Geographic Society as part of their 125th anniversary celebration.

<text>Florence Mabel Harding (née Kling; August 15, 1860 – November 21, 1924) was the first lady of the United States from 1921 until her husband&#x27;s death in 1923 as the wife of President Warren G. Harding.

==First and second marriage==

In 1880, Florence married Henry de Wolfe and they had a son, Marshall. After divorcing de Wolfe in 1886, she married Harding who was five years younger than she, in 1891. Harding was then a newspaper publisher in Marion, Ohio, and she became the acknowledged brains behind the business. Known as &quot;The Duchess&quot;, Florence Harding adapted well to the White House, where she gave notably elegant parties.

==Early life==
She was born Florence Mabel Kling above her father&#x27;s hardware store at 126 South Main Street in Marion, Ohio, on August 15, 1860. Florence was the eldest of three children of Amos Kling, a prominent Marion accountant and businessman of German descent, and Louisa Bouton Kling, who was of French Huguenot and English descent, as her Huguenot ancestors had fled France to England due to religious persecution. Her younger brothers were Clifford, born in 1861, and Vetallis, born in 1864. Florence attended school at Union School beginning in 1866 and studied the classics. Her father prospered as a banker and was a stockholder in the Columbus &amp; Toledo Railroad, President of the Agricultural Society, and member of the school board. Florence developed a passion for horses early in life and participated in several horse races. Her father trained her in several business skills such as banking, real estate, and farm management.

Aiming to become a concert pianist, Florence began studies at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music after graduating from high school in 1878. As she recalled, she spent seven hours per day on the piano for three years, once playing until her finger bled. On return trips to Marion, Florence often clashed with her father, who would whip her with a cherry switch. At the age of 19 she eloped with Henry Atherton (&quot;Pete&quot;) de Wolfe (4 May 1859, Marion – 8 March 1894, Marion) and they were married in Columbus, Ohio, on January 22, 1880. A record of the issuance of their marriage license was printed in &quot;The Marion Star&quot;. Florence gave birth to her only child, Marshall Eugene, on September 22, 1880. Her husband worked in a warehouse but alcoholism led him to abandon the family on December 31, 1882. Florence moved in with her friend Carrie Wallace while her mother Louisa financially supported the mother and child. Florence became a piano teacher to provide extra income and enjoyed skating at night. Her estranged husband had attempted to rob a train in 1885, and the pair were divorced in 1886.

Eventually, Amos Kling offered to adopt Marshall but would not provide for his daughter. As a result, Marshall adopted the Kling surname despite not being legally adopted. This freed Florence for other romantic flings, and she soon met Warren Gamaliel Harding, owner of the &quot; Marion Star&quot;. He was five years younger than she, and his sister Charity was a student of hers. Soon the &quot;Marion Star&quot; reported on Florence&#x27;s trips to Yellowstone National Park with her mother and Warren Harding. Harding and Florence became a couple by the summer of 1886. Who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.

==Second Marriage to Harding==
In 1890, Florence became engaged to Warren Harding. They married on July 8, 1891, opposed by her father, who thought Warren Harding was using her to climb the social ladder and had a wealthier suitor in mind for his daughter. He repeated a rumor that Harding had Black ancestry and threatened to shoot the young man at the courthouse. After the wedding, which Florence&#x27;s mother secretly attended, the couple embarked on a honeymoon tour of Chicago, St. Paul, Yellowstone, and the Great Lakes. The new Mrs. Harding made the unconventional decision not to wear a wedding ring. Warren referred to her as &quot;the boss&quot;, while she affectionately called him &quot;Sonny.&quot;
==Newspaper leadership==
They had no children of their own, but Florence&#x27;s son Marshall lived with them intermittently and received encouragement from Warren to work in journalism. When her husband entered the Battle Creek Sanitarium for depression in January 1894, Florence became the informal business manager of the &quot;Marion Star&quot; although she never had any official role, immediately demonstrating both the talent and the character to run a newspaper. She organized a circulation department, improved distribution, trained the newsboys, and purchased equipment at keen prices. Her newsboys became known as &quot;Mrs. Harding&#x27;s boys&quot; throughout the town, and she alternatively gave out awards for achievement and doled out physical punishment. Some Marion children began to fear Florence for paddling the boys in the street. One of the newsboys, Norman Thomas, later the Socialist presidential candidate, declared that Warren was the front-man, but Florence was the real driving power of the &quot;Marion Star.&quot;

Warren returned to work on the &quot;Star&quot; in December 1894 though Florence continued to nurse him at home. After the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, Florence was instrumental in developing the first wire report. Although she never wrote any articles, she did suggest stories based on leads she had, particularly stories to appeal to women. She hired the first woman reporter in Ohio, Jane Dixon, and supported her when there was a backlash from the people of Marion. Through Florence&#x27;s leadership, the &quot;Star&quot; prospered and increased its revenue. She also knew about the machinery of the newspaper plant and how to fix it. Though Warren was not particularly supportive of women&#x27;s rights at the time, belittling rallies for temperance, he greatly appreciated his wife&#x27;s help at the office and respected her frank opinions. Florence wrote of her husband, &quot;he does well when he listens to me and poorly when he does not.&quot;

Florence encouraged her husband in his first political run for the state senate in 1899. She managed the finances and fended off unsurprising objections from her father, who enlisted Mark Hanna for help, though Warren was ultimately elected. Florence observed the legislature from the balcony and frequently made trips to newspaper offices to win her husband&#x27;s good coverage and observe their operations. She also began her custom of consulting with an astrologer during this first stint in Columbus. Encouraging her husband to be pragmatic and not to alienate anyone, he was reelected in 1901. In 1903, he was elected lieutenant governor. Journalist Mark Sullivan wrote of Florence, &quot;As a wife, she had that particular kind of eagerness to make good which, in a personality that is at once superficial and unsure of itself, sometimes manifests itself in too strenuous activity, a too steady staying on the job.&quot;
==1905 kidney ailment and emergency surgery==
In February 1905, Florence needed emergency surgery for nephroptosis (&#x27;floating kidney&#x27;) and was initially treated by a homoeopathic doctor Charles E. Sawyer. His close links with the Harding family, and Florence&#x27;s total trust and dependence on him, would later prove controversial. Sawyer referred Florence to Dr. Jamez Fairchild Baldwin, who &quot;wired&quot; the kidney in place and did not remove it due to heart damage that she had already suffered. Confined to a hospital bed for weeks, Florence later stated this experience made her more empathetic for hospital patients.

==Husband&#x27;s adultery, Florence&#x27;s view of women&#x27;s rights==
During her convalescence, Warren began an affair with a close friend of hers, Carrie Phillips, who had recently lost a child. Florence did not find out until she intercepted a letter between the two in 1911, which led her to consider divorce, though she never pursued it. Apparently, she considered herself too invested in her husband&#x27;s career to leave him, though her discovery of the affair did not end it. It was one of several adulterous escapades that Warren embarked upon, of which Florence found herself increasingly resigned though she expressed her disapproval. She tried to discourage the affairs by sticking by her husband&#x27;s side at all times. Florence never spoke to Carrie Phillips again, and only acknowledged her in bitter attacks.

Warren and Florence left for a trip to Europe in August 1911. During her stay in England, Florence began to sympathize with women leading protests and became an ardent suffragette. When she returned to America, she went to a rally for women&#x27;s right to vote in Columbus. Despite her feelings on the matter, Florence remained silent on women&#x27;s suffrage during the 1912 election. She continued to be treated by Dr. Sawyer at his new White Oaks Sanitarium for various ailments and deepened her study of astrology. Florence also gave her husband advice on his political chances, discouraging a run for governor in 1912. Instead, she had her sights set on Washington, D.C., and Warren broadened his national reputation by very publicly supporting William Howard Taft at the Republican convention. After Taft was defeated by Woodrow Wilson in the election, Warren sought solace by writing poetry to Carrie Phillips.
==Inheritance, further health problems, Warren&#x27;s election as Senator==
On October 20, 1913, Florence&#x27;s father passed away. Despite their strained relationship, his daughter received $35,000 and valuable real estate in the will. Florence had her own health problems, suffering a serious kidney attack in the winter of 1913 and went to live at the White Oaks Sanitarium. Dr. Sawyer feared that Florence would not survive the year, but his patient managed to recover. In spite of her ill health, she encouraged her husband to run for Senate in 1914 and resolved to be part of the campaign. She limited her role to advisory management and persuaded her husband to ignore pressures to have anti-Catholic remarks against the Democratic opponent, Timothy Hogan. With her assistance, Warren won the Senate election by 102,000 votes.
==Death of son, depression, animal rights==
Florence&#x27;s son Marshall died on January 1, 1915, of tuberculosis. She made a trip to Colorado later in the year to pay his debts and ended up becoming friends with some of his associates and wife Esther. Along with her husband, she travelled to California and Hawaii before settling into life in Washington, D.C. as the wife of a senator. After returning from Marion, Florence decided to rent a house in the Kalorama neighborhood of D.C. In January 1916, Florence suffered from heart palpitations, and she called Dr. Sawyer to help with her mental health. To cope with a growing depression, she helped furnish the new house and hired staff for assistance. Florence helped her husband with his correspondence and invited press attention. Despite her stand on suffrage, she could not persuade Warren in 1916 to make up his mind, as he preferred partisan leadership.

Florence became active in animal rights and joined the Animal Rescue League, Humane Society, and ASPCA. She spoke out against animal cruelty and gave freely of its literature to friends. In a brief autobiography in 1916, she mentioned her fondness for horses and concern about their abuse. Florence did not like automobiles, but relented when making frequent trips back to Marion. In Washington D.C., Florence struck up a fast and lasting friendship with the mining heiress and socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, frequently playing bridge and visiting movie theaters. As a result, Warren wrote to Dr. Sawyer in April 1917, &quot;Mrs. Harding is well and looking better than she has for three or four years.
==World War I==
After the U.S. entered World War I, Florence occupied herself in working toward a victory. She helped Ohio women who moved to Washington, D.C. for jobs find housing, and helped Lou Hoover set up dining and recreation spaces for the female workers. Florence frequently visited nurseries and daycare centers to assist mothers who had to work during the day. Alongside other political spouses, she handed out tin cups of coffee and sandwiches to soldiers departing from Union Station. Florence also volunteered at the Walter Reed Hospital, and found a sense of satisfaction in this work missing from her heretofore existence. She worked with other Senate wives to create a Red Cross Unit and produce clothing for soldiers on the battlefield. In order to better monitor the events on the front, Florence avidly read several newspapers and learned the pronunciation of foreign towns and locations.

Warren continued his affair with Carrie Phillips, alongside other women like the young Nan Britton, despite the suspicion that Phillips was a German spy. This proved to be untrue, though she did have sympathies with the German cause. Florence found out about this fact, perhaps being told by her husband, and reacted with rage. During the summer of 1918, while greeting soldiers leaving from the Marion train station, Florence spotted Phillips complaining about the futility of sending men to fight. Florence approached her and got into a heated argument, publicly rebuking her in front of many onlookers. Despite this public display of his wife&#x27;s temper, Warren soon after sent Carrie love letters proclaiming his devotion, albeit with the caveat that a divorce from Florence was not feasible.

In November 1918, Florence&#x27;s kidney swelled to ten times its regular size. This was perhaps her worst attack since 1905 and left her bedridden for weeks. She was treated by Dr. Sawyer&#x27;s son Carl, who had been stationed at Camp Meade (now Fort Meade). Warren stayed at her side until it was clear she was feeling better. By March 1919 Florence had recovered enough to attend events at Evalyn&#x27;s house while her husband golfed. Florence was in attendance at the Senate on July 10 when President Wilson requested America join the League of Nations, an idea she opposed. During the summer, her husband began to be mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, which Florence was initially not happy with since she thought he didn&#x27;t have enough of a national reputation.
==Warren Harding&#x27;s election as president==
By 1920, Warren was a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, though not a front-runner. Florence gave him tentative support, apparently influenced by a Washington clairvoyant &#x27;Madame Marcia&#x27; Champrey, who correctly forecast that Warren would become president, but added that he would die in office. Florence took a more active role at the Republican convention than most candidates wives and curried favor with journalists, who liked to record her often colorful remarks. She lobbied delegates to consider her husband after the convention became deadlocked, and he eventually became the nominee. Warren largely conducted a front porch campaign, and Florence had control of whom her husband met inside the house. She was very precise with her appointments for her husband and telephoned campaign managers if he was late. She set off a waffle craze after &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported her eating a waffle at breakfast, and guests asked to be served it during their visit. The election was overshadowed by attempted extortion by Carrie Phillips, threatening to reveal Warren&#x27;s adultery. However, Florence&#x27;s newspaper experience gave her an advantage over other candidates&#x27; wives; as Henry DeWolfe was dead, she was able to deflect press inquiries about her first marriage by implying that she had been widowed. In addition, she instructed the campaign not to respond to allegations of Warren&#x27;s partial black ancestry. Florence also earned the approval of ex-President Taft, who reported the following insights about Florence after a Christmas Eve breakfast with the Hardings:

On election night, Warren received 404 electoral votes, defeating Democratic challenger James M. Cox who received 127. In the celebration, a mob of supporters lifted Florence on their shoulders. She seemed not particularly enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming the first lady, telling a friend &quot;I don&#x27;t feel any too confident, I can tell you. I haven&#x27;t any doubt about him, but I&#x27;m not so sure of myself.&quot; Following the election, departing First Lady Edith Wilson invited Florence to the White House for a tour of her future home. Florence accepted, provided her friend Evalyn, who was previously very critical of the Wilsons, was invited as well. After a disagreement over tea, Edith had her housekeeper give the tour.

==First Lady==

===Style and political influence===
On March 4, 1921, Warren G. Harding was inaugurated as president and Florence Harding became first lady, immediately taking an active role in national politics. At times, she appeared to dominate the President; Florence even had a strong influence on her husband&#x27;s selection of cabinet members, in particular favoring Charles R. Forbes as director of the Veterans Bureau and Andrew Mellon as treasury secretary. She approved of the selection of Charles Evans Hughes as secretary of state though privately thought Elihu Root would be a better choice. At the inauguration, observers believed that she was prompting her husband with a speech she had written, as there were several references to women&#x27;s new role in American political life. Florence ensured that everyone who worked for the campaign in Marion was invited to the inauguration, and asked that a woman who fainted in the crowds be helped. Secret service agent Harry L. Barker was assigned to protect Florence, making her the first wife of a president to have her own agent. The two developed a close, trusting partnership with each other.

After Warren addressed the Senate, Florence asked her husband, &quot;Well, Warren Harding, I have got you the Presidency. What are you going to do with it?&quot; He replied, &quot;May God help me, for I need it.&quot; In Warren&#x27;s first pronouncement as president, he ordered that the gates of the White House be opened to the public as per Florence&#x27;s wishes. The move was praised by the press, with an announcement that tourists could come to the property in the following week. Florence told a senator that she was aiming to become the most successful first lady in history. By the time the White House opened to the public, Florence offered to act as tour guide herself. Many different groups and individuals came to meet her, ranging from Bill Tilden to Albert Einstein.

Florence read mail after breakfast and wrote invitations for social events. She was the first first lady to send original responses to the many letters received. She would often stand at the south portico to have her photograph taken with large groups. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; praised her as being &quot;far more generous receiving special groups at the White House than were her predecessors.&quot; She obsessed over her appearance but insisted she hated clothes. By wearing long skirts, she was somewhat out of style with the new fad being flapper dresses, but Florence remarked that she had no right to dictate how short the skirts should be. In addition, she launched new fashions like the silk black neckband, which became known as &quot;Flossie Clings&quot; after her maiden name. She carried small bouquets of blue-violet flowers to complement her blue eyes. Despite her emphasis on fashion, Florence was economical elsewhere in the White House budget, which was highly praised in the wake of the 1921 recession.

As a White House hostess, Florence presided over elegant parties that often had several thousand guests where her husband would refer to her as The Duchess. These parties were largely a continuation of the front porch campaign, and she also had dinner parties on the presidential yacht. Florence relished in her role as White House tour guide, learning about the history of the property from books and displaying a portrait of Sarah Yorke Jackson. Despite her growing popularity with the public, high society largely shunned Florence and favored Second Lady Grace Coolidge, with whom Florence had an uneasy relationship. The couple&#x27;s dog Laddie Boy was a hit though, sparking a craze for Airedale terriers.

Florence became the first first lady since Frances Cleveland whose face was so recognizable to the public, as she frequently appeared in newsreel footage alongside Warren unveiling statues, attending baseball games, and dedicating the Lincoln Memorial. Several flowers were named in her honor, and the composer David S. Ireland wrote a song called &quot;Flo from Ohio.&quot; Due to the popular interest in psychoanalysis, some psychological profiles were written of her in newspapers. The First Couple increased their popularity by attending movie screenings and meeting actors, who were previously seen as vulgar by high society. Al Jolson was a frequent guest, and Florence gave D.W. Griffith a tour and lunch at the White House. Florence became the first first lady to appear in movies with her signature wave to crowds. Evalyn McLean taught her how to operate a camera and she made some films of women at the Potomac Park Civic Club.

===Opposition to smoking, public support for Prohibition===
She became known for her opposition to smoking after a photographer captured her holding down the arm of Helen Pratt, who was smoking a cigarette. The Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union urged her to use her influence to advance the antismoking cause, though she politely declined. On the subject of drinking, Florence was an outward proponent of maintaining Prohibition as respect for the law. In private, however, she secretly served alcohol to guests. The frequent guests and parties took its toll on Florence, who wrote, &quot;My days are so full I don&#x27;t know which way to turn,&quot; but added &quot;it&#x27;s a great life if you don&#x27;t weaken.&quot;

===Reliance on Madame Marcia, investigation of Warren&#x27;s lovers===
Florence worked to protect the image of herself and Warren, concealing his drinking, womanizing, and corruption in the cabinet. She insisted on being beside him and once told him to get back to work when he was golfing. She was concerned as to her husband&#x27;s personal safety, partially because of Madame Marcia&#x27;s prediction of his early demise. Despite the fact there were no public revelations of her meeting with the psychic since the 1920 campaign, the consultations continued in earnest, and Marcia was even invited to the White House. Florence relied on astrology to determine Warren&#x27;s personal schedule, a fact that became known to many in his inner circle. She also feared his susceptibility to blackmail since the Carrie Phillips debacle. After returning from Japan in 1921, Phillips visited Warren at the White House, much to the chagrin of Florence. Several other women also received money from the President, and Florence employed Gaston Means to spy on Nan Britton to steal her love letters.

A trip to Alaska which Florence eagerly anticipated was planned for the summer of 1921 but had to be postponed in lieu of the work obligations. Instead, the Hardings took a cruise through New England and periodical motor trips. Florence developed a thrill for fast driving, nearly having an accident at fifty miles an hour when her car veered toward a telephone pole. The Budget Bureau director criticized her for this, which she simply shrugged off. She was an avid theatergoer, particularly comedies and musicals. Warren, on the other hand, preferred to watch strippers.
===Views===
Florence made her views known on everything from the League of Nations to animal rights, racism, and women&#x27;s rights. She also moved with the times: flying in planes, showing after-dinner movies. She was the first first lady to vote, operate a movie camera, own a radio, or invite movie stars to the White House. She had a strong concern for immigrant children trapped by bureaucracy, though criticized &quot;hyphenated Americans.&quot; She was willing to risk criticism when she championed social issues, and she never lent her name to a cause unless it moved her. Some of her suggestions were rather radical, including the attempt to cure drug addicts through a vegetarian diet. Florence supported the victims of the Armenian genocide and personally funded a child survivor with monthly checks. She was willing to forgo a meal and donate to the Chinese Famine fund, but was critical of American support to aid relief of the 1921 Soviet famine, arguing that Russia should have given up communism before accepting American food and medicine. Likewise, she did not support relief for Irish families as it could be seen as anti-British. Florence opposed vivisection in a public letter and supported the Humane Education Society, though she continued to eat meat. Florence&#x27;s own special agenda was the welfare of war veterans, whose cause she championed wholeheartedly. She referred to them as &quot;our boys&quot;. Since World War I had left many men disfigured and ill, Florence went out of her way to care for the patients at Walter Reed Hospital, seeking to improve ward life. Her efforts led to women&#x27;s group funding projects at veterans wards which the federal government failed to do.
====Women====
She lifted the informal ban on &quot;unacceptable women&quot; (usually meaning divorced women) instituted under Theodore Roosevelt. She sparked a small furor by inviting the National Council of Catholic Women to the White House, as liberals disdained their anti-birth control efforts. Florence would not criticize Margaret Sanger&#x27;s birth control push as she herself had used it earlier in life. Florence hosted a tennis match between Marion Jessup and Molla Mallory. Additionally, she sought to associate with popular female icons of the 1920s. When Madame Curie visited the White House, Florence praised her as an example of a professional achiever and excellent scientist who was also a supportive wife. Florence accepted an inscribed book from the Curies, breaking her informal rule against autographs.

Florence raised public awareness of women who managed household finance. She stated that married women should know something about their husband&#x27;s work. She agreed to sign on to a pledge to reduce the consumption of sugar when its price became exorbitant. However, she also held some traditional values, such as it being more practical for women to raise families rather than working a regular job. Florence became the president of the Southern Industrial Association, an informal role in an organization that provided education for mountain women. She personally helped a man get a job at a factory after his wife wrote asking for help.
====Media====
She sought to make herself available to the press, a stark contrast with her predecessor Edith Wilson who denied press access. Florence had more press interviews than all the First Ladies before her combined. She enjoyed talking to journalists she liked, such as Kate Forbes and Jane Dixon. Her press conferences, which started a month after the inauguration, became a regular event, held over four o&#x27;clock tea. Although she frequently discussed politics, she did not like being quoted verbatim in the reports. She referred to female reporters as &quot;us girls&quot;, owing to her history in running the Marion Star. Although Florence did not believe herself to be a gifted public speaker, she regularly gave impromptu speeches or &quot;little patriotic addresses&quot; to organizations such as the Red Cross and League of Women Voters.

In public, Florence bragged about the President and his accomplishments. But in private, she let her political difference be known. She would frequently express how the Executive should best perform his job and tried to prevent or minimize any mistakes. Florence kept up on the latest political news and knew the details of government better than almost any woman of her era. She sometimes argued with him over the content of his speeches, occasionally shaking a finger at him if she was upset. Once she became upset at a speech that proposed a single presidential term of six years and refused to leave until the clause was omitted. If the discussion ever became too heated, Warren would leave the room to express his irritation, but he never scolded her.
====Public officials====
Florence had a hand in selecting minor public officials, particularly postmasters. In terms of patronage, she would place party loyalty above personal connections though she did pick several Democrats for the postmaster. Former coworkers at the Marion Star only received her consideration if they had a documented partisan streak. Her authority was respected by politicians from all levels of governance. When she wanted information on someone, Florence used unconventional methods particularly on Herbert Hoover, whom she disliked. She informed Senator Hiram Johnson that his Democratic challenger was a stooge for Hoover, which caused Johnson to send election information to her via Evalyn McLean. In response to the 1921 recession, the government reviewed government agencies in hopes of consolidation, and Florence herself checked budgets and requested a memo from the Marines about the cost of uniforms.

Attorney general Harry M. Daugherty was the Cabinet member with which Florence was the most political. Florence scheduled private citizens to meet with him, and in return, he always complied with her requests. One time she asked Daugherty to look into the case of the Bosko brothers in West Virginia who were convicted of burglary. On closer inspection, the case relied on flimsy evidence including forced confessions, and all three were issued presidential pardons. Florence requested that Daugherty commute a death sentence in Alabama, but he replied that the Justice Department had no jurisdiction in the case. Other Cabinet members obeyed her, with Albert Fall assuring her that the Interior Department would pay immediate attention to any request that she forwarded. Her authority received some ribbing from Life magazine, which depicted &quot;The Chief Executive and Mr. Harding&quot; in a 1922 cartoon. 

====Race====
Both Warren and Florence Harding were relatively progressive on the subject of race, although the President largely toned down his rhetoric when giving speeches in the South. An important exception to this was a speech in Alabama in which he favored equality between the races, while Florence loudly applauded a black band in a parade. Florence fought racism in under-the-radar ways. She pressured her husband to rescind an appointment of Helen Dortch Longstreet to a political position since she favored rule by white men only. In terms of international affairs, Florence was not as active, although she did participate in the International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments from November 1921 to February 1922. She considered her role important in bringing together the various nations in a common understanding. She took part in the burial of &quot;Buddy&quot; in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, reflecting her longstanding interest in veterans&#x27; affairs.
===Bomb threat, media attention, husband&#x27;s continued infidelity===
Florence insisted her family spend Christmas 1921 with the McLeans after hearing about a bomb threat against Warren. Bombs intended for the President were found the next day, making Florence appear wise in retrospect. By the end of Harding&#x27;s first year in office, newspapers wrote assessments of his performance, largely praising Florence&#x27;s role in the administration. However, negativity against her appeared after a House Appropriations Committee hearing found that the $50,000 budget for the White House had been almost completely spent, largely due to her entertaining so many people and reopening the grounds to tourists. The head groundskeeper estimated that it would cost $3000 to repair the greenhouses due to how many flowers Florence displayed in the White House. Throughout the winter, Florence was eager to join Evalyn in Florida, but when they arrived Warren continued his womanizing publicly, to the chagrin of his wife.

After returning from Florida, the Hardings met the oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny. associated with Interior Secretary Albert Fall. Warren&#x27;s approval of oil leases to Doheny would result in the Teapot Dome Scandal, and while Harding did not profit from it, Fall did, handsomely. In May 1922, Florence met and became close to a naval doctor, Joel Thompson Boone, who relished his presidential posting. Boone also became acquainted with Dr. Sawyer, who was becoming increasingly unpopular in the veteran&#x27;s bureau. In July, the Hardings returned to Marion to take part in its centennial celebration. Florence greeted Nan Britton during the festivities, unaware she was carrying on an affair with her husband.
===Renewed kidney problems===
In August, the President addressed Congress regarding the increasingly economically damaging coal and rail strikes. Florence followed the events of the strikes closely, while Warren drank excessively to deal with the anxiety it brought about in him. Florence instructed her Secret Service agent Harry Barker to keep tabs on her husband, especially if she happened to be away from him. Her discovery of the affair with Nan Britton took its toll on her health. In early September she came down with a serious kidney ailment, and the public was alerted as to the severity of it on September 8 in a medical bulletin. The eminent physician Charles Horace Mayo was called in to treat her, which sparked jealousy from Dr. Sawyer. By the time he arrived, she was suffering from sepsis and was falling in and out of consciousness.

News of Florence&#x27;s illness sparked an outpouring of support throughout the country. It sparked many editorials in newspapers and a rumor that she had passed, which was dispelled. The gates of the White House were opened to accommodate the thousands of well-wishers who came to pray for Florence. Dr. Mayo insisted that emergency surgery was the only option to save Florence, but Dr. Sawyer disagreed. He eventually gave the option to Florence, who was now lucid and did not favor surgery. By September 11 her condition had worsened that, as she later related, she had a near death experience seeing two figures at the end of her bed. Florence insisted she would not die because her husband needed her. As she fought back from what she called the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;, Florence spontaneously relieved an obstruction and required bed care from the nurses. Her condition gradually improved to the point that Dr. Mayo did not feel his service was necessary.
===Improved health, support for veterans===
A sign of Florence&#x27;s improving condition was the re-opening of the White House to tourists on October 1. She was informed of Republican losses the day after the midterm elections and was incredulous that several Senators had lost. In her improving condition, Florence continued to campaign for war veterans, starting a &quot;Forget-Me-Not&quot; drive-by purchasing the first flower from her room. She continued to keep tabs on who was entering and exiting the White House, which prompted Warren to use the Friendship estate for his rendezvous with Nan Britton. By Thanksgiving, Florence was well enough to preside over her first dinner since the illness. On December 7 she insisted she meet with Georges Clemenceau, who was having lunch with Warren.

Florence had a session with psychologist Émile Coué to deal with the frustration during her convalescence after being impressed with his writings. Her illness and recovery took its toll on her husband, who did show genuine care for her but also wanted more freedom for himself. Florence declared, &quot;this illness has been a blessing,&quot; since it drew the two closer together. Warren read to her in bed about Yellowstone Park, a place to which she longed to return. Florence also placed her complete trust in Dr. Sawyer, whom Warren believed had brought her back to life. In January 1923, Warren took ill and was bedridden for weeks. Florence was responsible for making sure he did not undertake much work during his illness, once sending away an aide who handed the President some papers to review, and brought Warren to bed.
===Anger with corrupt officials===
After a group of Congressman undertook an investigation of the Veteran&#x27;s Bureau and Charles Forbes was shown to display criminal behavior rather than simply being a shoddy administrator, Florence was furious. She felt personally betrayed by Forbes and wanted him dismissed at once. Warren, on the other hand, refused to believe Forbes was corrupt, looking for further information. When this information turned out to incriminate him, the President refused to accept it and sent Harry Daugherty away when he rattled off some allegations. Florence eventually persuaded her husband to fire him, after throttling Forbes by the neck. Forbes officially resigned on February 1 from the Veteran&#x27;s Bureau. His treachery caused Florence to call in Madame Marcia to see who else of her husband&#x27;s associates might be treacherous. During this period, she increasingly retreated from the public eye, with her only public act being participating in a national fuel curfew in response to shortages.
===Resignation of Albert Fall, travels===
In early March, shortly before a planned trip to Florida, Florence was informed that Albert Fall was leaving the Interior Department as a Standard Oil agent, and she hastily organized a dinner in his honor. Before accepting the resignation, Warren urged Fall to talk to his wife, but she could not convince him to stay. By March 5, the Hardings and Evalyn took off for Florida. During a stop in Cocoa Beach, Florence met up with her brother Cliff and his family. She enjoyed her stay in Miami, with the city using the Presidential visit as a selling point for developers. Warren continued his run of poor health, especially heart issues, though Florence remained unaware of this. During an interview with a reporter, she mentioned she wished to travel to Alaska to see what could be done to bring its tremendous natural resources to the public. After ten days in Miami, they went first to St. Augustine and then Jacksonville.

===Death of Jess Smith===
In interviews with reporters, Florence indicated that she wanted to get back to doing things due to her return to health. An example of this was lobbying against the purchase of a property to be used as the vice president&#x27;s official residence. By the spring of 1923, Florence had learned of Fall&#x27;s seemingly legal leasing of Teapot Dome to Harry F. Sinclair, whom Florence had recently met. She also became aware of Harding associate Jess Smith&#x27;s illegal efforts, which was only confirmed during a session with Madame Marcia. After being largely snubbed by Warren and Florence Harding, Smith died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound on May 30.

Despite having recently turned to Harry Daugherty for advice on the management of some of her assets, Florence began to distance herself from him due to the suspicion that he played a part in Smith&#x27;s death. She also distanced herself from Evalyn somewhat, not visiting her house though she did send flowers and notes. In the midst of Smith&#x27;s death and its subsequent fallout, the Hardings were planning an exhausting cross-country trip. Warren was to give seventy speeches in major cities throughout the country. The trip was to include Florence&#x27;s long-anticipated excursion to Alaska. A diversion from the planning was a set of speeches Florence gave to Big Brothers and Sisters and the National Conference of Social Work. During a convention of Shriners in June, Florence played a prominent role, conducting the band in a parade and selling pictures of Laddie Boy for animal rights organizations. Warren gave a speech denouncing hate groups though it was falsely reported by some outlets he had joined the Ku Klux Klan.
===Prediction of Warren Harding&#x27;s death===
Warren decided to draw up a new will after the festivities ended. This prompted Florence to have another reading with Madame Marcia, who predicted the President would not live to 1925. Dr. Sawyer assured her that Warren was in excellent physical condition, though an examination by a different doctor revealed heart trouble. Several Senators urged him not to go on the trip. As a precautionary measure, several medical personnel were to follow his every move, per Florence&#x27;s wishes. After almost a year of being out of the limelight, Florence longed for the adoring crowds she was expecting to meet. Although it was ultimately Warren&#x27;s decision with regards to the Alaska trip, Florence was determined to go despite the consequences.

==Death of Warren Harding==

By 1923, both Florence and her husband were suffering from dangerous illnesses, but still undertook a coast-to-coast rail tour, which they called the Voyage of Understanding. Florence proved highly popular at their many scheduled stops, but Warren was visibly ailing. After falling seriously ill while visiting British Columbia, Harding died at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco on August 2, 1923.

On this tour, Warren had been under the care of Charles Sawyer, who is believed to have misdiagnosed the President&#x27;s condition, and administered stimulants that brought on his fatal heart attack. As Florence did not request an autopsy and also destroyed many of his papers, a controversial theory was put forward in a semi-fictional book &quot;The Strange Death of President Harding&quot;, claiming that Florence had poisoned her husband. However, this claim was soon debunked.

==Widowhood and death==
Florence had intended to make a new life in Washington and was planning a tour of Europe. But when her kidney ailment returned, she followed Sawyer&#x27;s advice and took a cottage in the grounds of his sanitarium in Marion. Her last public appearance was at the local Remembrance Day parade where she stood to salute the veterans. Harding died of renal failure, ten days later, on November 21, 1924, aged 64.

Her grandchildren, George Warren and Eugenia DeWolfe, were the principal heirs to her estate.
Until the completion of the Harding Tomb, Florence&#x27;s body lay with that of her husband in the common receiving vault at Marion&#x27;s city cemetery.

<text>The Campus Martius (Latin for &#x27;Field of Mars&#x27;; Italian: &quot;Campo Marzio&quot;) was a publicly owned area of ancient Rome about in extent. In the Middle Ages, it was the most populous area of Rome. The IV rione of Rome, Campo Marzio, which covers a smaller section of the original area, bears the same name.

==Antiquity==
According to Rome&#x27;s foundation myth, prior to the founding of the city, Rhea Silvia had her twin sons, Romulus and Remus, taken by the King of Alba Longa. The boys were later discarded in the swelling Tiber River, which would later run along the Campus&#x27; western boundary. Washing ashore further downriver, the brothers would return decades later to found a new city. Romulus, who became Rome&#x27;s sole king (after killing his brother Remus), ruled for many years until sometime in the seventh century B.C. As he came to the end of his life, a storm cloud descended upon the center of the open field outside the city&#x27;s pomerium in order to lift the elderly king to the afterlife.

This land, &quot;between the city and the Tiber&quot;, became the property of Rome&#x27;s last Etruscan king, Tarquinius Superbus. After his defeat and exile, the plain was dedicated to the god Mars. Roman men assembled every spring before heading off to fight the hostile tribes that surrounded Rome, and citizens gathered for important religious festivals. With the exception of a small altar to Mars near the center of the field, no visible changes were made to the field until the fifth century B.C.

In 435 B.C., the Villa Publica was established in a prepared 300-meter clearing. The area was a gathering space for citizens to congregate every five years to be counted in a census, but had no permanent structures; no additions would be made for another two centuries.

With the advent of the Punic Wars in the mid-third century B.C., Roman military expansion moved out of the Italian peninsula, resulting in the reduction of seasonal musters on the field. The number of foreign wars, however, greatly increased the amount of wealth flowing into Rome. Generals who had sworn to various deities to build temples in their honor if victorious used the vast amounts of wealth to fund these construction projects. Besides temples and wooden markets, entertainment venues were built as well, though they were to be temporary.

Starting in the time of Sulla, building lots were sold or granted to influential Romans, and insulae (apartment blocks) and villas encroached on the common land. It later became the place for comitia centuriata, civic meetings with weapons, and for the city&#x27;s militia. In 55 BC, Pompey constructed a permanent theater, the Theatrum Pompeium, the first stone theater in Rome. When the Curia Hostilia burned down in 52 BC, the theater was sometimes used as a meeting place for the Senate. The area was also used as the assembling ground for elections. Julius Caesar planned for the Saepta (enclosures used for elections) to be placed there; they were later completed by his heir Augustus (Octavian). In 33 BC, Octavian dedicated the Porticus Octaviae, built from spoils of the Roman-Dalmatian War.

During the Augustan period of the early Roman Empire, the area became officially part of the city: Rome was split into 14 regions, and the Campus Martius was divided into the VII Via Lata on the east and the IX Circus Flaminius nearer to the river. The Campus Martius also held the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace), built by the Senate to mark the establishment of peace by Augustus. It was intended to symbolize the successful completion of Augustus&#x27; efforts to stabilize the Empire. Marcus Agrippa had the original swampy ground made into a pool and baths in a setting of parkland and temples, the Laconicum Sudatorium or Baths of Agrippa. Also, he built the Porticus Argonautarum and the Pantheon, which was later rebuilt by Hadrian as it still stands today. In 19 BC, he also completed the Aqua Virgo, to supply water to these new baths and fountains.

In the non-populated northern area was the huge Mausoleum of Augustus. Other buildings that were made were the Theatre of Marcellus, the Temple for Isis (from around the time of Caligula), the baths and bridge by Nero, and Pompey&#x27;s theatre, where Julius Caesar was murdered by Marcus Brutus and his allies. After the great fire of 64 A.D. Domitian rebuilt the burnt monuments plus a stadium (eventually to become today&#x27;s Piazza Navona) and an Odeion (a small performance hall). In 119 A.D, reinforcing the themes of imperial divinity and apotheosis established by Augustus, Hadrian and the succeeding Antonines added a temple to Hadrian&#x27;s mother-in-law, the Divine Matidia, and a temple to the Divine Hadrian himself built by Antoninus Pius.

As was the case with the first two Flavian and Antonine emperors, the Severans did not commit many resources to construction projects in an already crowded Campus Martius. Their interests lay elsewhere in repairs and commissioning new structures in other regions of the capital. The Campus did not see another major architectural change until the reign of Aurelian.

The citizens of Rome took great pride in knowing that Rome required no fortifications because of the stability brought by the Pax Romana under the protection of the Roman Army. In 270 A.D., however, barbarian tribes flooded across the Germanic frontier and reached northern Italy as the Roman army struggled to stop them. To alleviate the city&#x27;s vulnerability, the emperor ordered the construction of a 19-kilometer-long, 6 to 8-meter-high brick wall, fortified with defensive turrets, named the Aurelian Walls. Aurelian did not live to see his work completed under his successor Probus, in 276 A.D. With the completion of the walls, the Campus Martius was finally incorporated into the rest of the city.

By the mid-fourth century, when emperor Constantius II visited Rome, now the former capital, many of the pagan temples were closed. Buildings dedicated to Christianity began to occupy their spaces. Some were reduced to supporting material, some were razed, and some were given new roles, such as the Pantheon. In 663 A.D. its bronze roof tiles were removed and replaced with lead, an act that Gregorius said was the result of &quot;excessive avarice and the &#x27;excessive greed for gold.&#x27;&quot; In the fifth century, Rome was burned and sacked twice: by the Visigoths in 410 A.D. and by the Vandals in 455 A.D. Three earthquakes racked the city between 408 and 508 A.D, and two floods washed over low-lying spaces in 398 and 411 A.D. Many marble facings and columns were tossed into kilns to be burned into lime powder for reuse.

Writing in the twelfth or thirteenth century, Magister Gregorius, marveled at those edifices in the Field of Mars whose antiquity was clear but whose names were not as certain. Looking down from the heights of one of Rome&#x27;s hills, he recorded that the great structures had been replaced by a &quot;forest of [medieval] towers&quot;. In 1581, French essayist Michel de Montaigne traveled to Rome and noted that &quot;upon the very wrecks of the ancient buildings, as they fall to ruin, the builders set out casually the foundations of new houses, as if these fragments were great masses of rock, firm and trustworthy. It is evident that many of the old streets lie more than thirty feet below the level of those now in existence.&quot;

The Campus Martius was located not in the city proper, but north of the Capitoline Hill. Until the imperial era, most of the region lay outside of the pomerium. The field covered an area of about 250 hectares, or , extending a little more than two kilometres north and south from the Capitoline to the porta Flaminia, and a little less than two kilometers east and west in its widest part, between the Quirinal and the river. It was low, from 10 to 15 metres above the level of the sea in antiquity, now 13 to 20, and from 3 to 8 above that of the Tiber, and of course subject to frequent inundations. Ancient writers say that there were several recognizable natural points, such as an oak grove north of the Tiber Island and the Palus Caprae, in the center of the space.

==Significance==
In Latin, Campus Martius means &quot;Field of Mars&quot;, a god highly considered in the Roman pantheon. Paul W. Jacobs III attributes the significance of Mars to his patronage of both military and agriculture. In the calendar year, March was the month named after Mars: this month first marked the beginning of when the consuls started to work until 153 BC.

The Campus Martius may have been named after the Ara Martis (&quot;Mars&#x27; altar&quot;), which was talked about starting in the eighth century BC. It is not known exactly when the Ara Martis was built or when it was destroyed.

The social climate and events surrounding Campus Martius were significant to Roman culture. Livy describes a horse race called the second Equirria, which started on March 14. The winning horse was killed and sacrificed to Mars.

The second event used to support his claim was the Anna Perenna. This event was when the plebs would go out to Campus Martius to eat and drink. The reason why Anna Perenna was important was because she was an ugly hag and she represented the end of a year, and Mars represented the nice beginning of the year.

The last event Jacobs II talks about is the Tubilustrium festival, which purified military instruments to summon the cruciate assemblies. This celebration used to validate the emperors&#x27; imperium, but later on the festival validated the consuls imperium.

==Architecture==
The style and structure of Campus Martius architecture went through several stages of development between the 6th century BC through Late Antiquity. It is virtually impossible to pinpoint exactly when and why these stages occurred, but some historians have sectionalized different periods where Roman architecture faced relatively significant transformation.

===Regal Rome and early Republic===
Between the mid-6th century BC and the end of the early Republic (324 BC) four temples were built. These were Temple of Diana [6th century], Temple of Castor and Pollux [495 BC], Temple of Apollo Sosianus [431 BC] and Temple of Juno Regina [392 BC]. Of these four structures, many view the Temple of Diana (Rome) as semi-legendary since it lacks enough sustainable evidence to prove its existence. The reason these two periods are combined as one is because there is minimal certainty on the structure and style of these temples. The reason for this, out of probability, is because the material used at the time was neither concrete, stone or marble, materials that are sustainable longer term and not only that but over two centuries there is certainly the risk of the destruction of these temples.

===Hellenistic Age===
After the death of Alexander the Great in 324 BC or the beginning of the &quot;wave of Hellenism&quot; there was a drastic increase in terms building construction within the city of Rome. In the case of Campus Martius, specifically during the &quot;wave of Hellenism&quot;, there were seven temples built. These new temples constructed were as follows; Temple of Bellona [296 BC], Temple of Fortuna [293 BC], Temple of Juturna [241 BC], Temple of Hercules [221 BC], Temple of Vulcan [214 BC) and Temple of Fortuna Equestris [173 BC]. The one temple excluded on that prior list is a temple built between 190 BC and 179 BC. It is uncertain if this temple was as Cicero writes, the “Temple of Nymphs”, or as other sources believe the “Temple of the Lares Permarini.

This period of Hellenism was the first major step in which the Roman temples, as well as the temples found in Campus Martius were generally made of stone architecture. This new style was in a way, a step up from the simpler early forms, which often appear coarse and bulky in comparison to the aesthetic perfection and refinement of the later structures. This period a transformation occurred from simple experimentation to the strict mathematical complexity of ground plans and superstructures. The Hellenistic Period was not only an expansion in terms of temples numerically within the Campus Martius, but also a stylistic transformation.

===Late Republic and early Empire===
Similar to the Hellenistic Period, the Late Republic and Early Empire was also a period of several construction projects within the Campus Martius. This period, chronologically, began at the end of the third and final Punic War and lasted until the end of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty in 65 AD. During this period there were six temples built in Campus Martius. They were the Temple of Jupiter Stator [146 BC], the Temple of Feronia [Pre-100 BC], the Temple of Neptunus [97 BC], the Temple of Isis and Serapis [43 BC] and the Temple of Mars Ultor [2 BC]. The one temple excluded from this list is the Temple of Minerva Chalcidica. The reason for this exclusion is because it is unknown whether this temple was built by Pompey in 60 BC or built by Augustus in 29 BC. Certain sources support the belief that Dion Cassius attributes this temple to Augustus: &quot;Temple of Minerva, which was called Chalcidicum”
Unlike the structural and stylistic transformation from Regal Period to the Hellenistic Period the temples in the Campus Martius were rather consistent. The main reason that these two periods are separated is because the motivation or reasoning for building these temples changed. In the past these temples were more commonly than not, an attribute to certain individuals for their past success by fellow patrons, but following the end of the Hellenistic period these temples became more of political instruments than ever before. Instead of being merely genuine and slightly political “donations” that exemplified the successful of individuals, these temples in Campus Martius now were expected to trigger propaganda values whenever large architectural projects took place.

===Roman Empire===
Alongside Rome, temples built within the Campus Martius faced a “fundamental change in stylistic direction” during the latter half of the first century on. This was a period when the sculptures and linear forms of the classical past was first firmly challenged by the canopied volume of the future. This was a historical period for Roman architecture in that, the catalyst for architects to embrace concrete as a design material or as Nero describes it break free from “the shackles of the classical past”. For possibly the first time Campus Martius and all of Rome faced a period where they moved away from the classical ways of architecture.

==Monuments and historical architectural discrepancies==

===&quot;Horologium Augusti&quot;===

Before the 1980s, the reconstruction of the obelisk and its usage were erroneous. Prior to that era, Buchner&#x27;s paper and reconstruction of the obelisk was blindly believed and deemed as accurate. His reconstruction was arguing that the obelisk with the gnomon on top of it was used as a sundial, using the sun&#x27;s shadow&#x27;s reflection to keep track of the hours of the day. Furthermore, Buchner argued that the sundial was integrated into the design of the Ara Pacis in a way that the shadow cast directly onto the altar on Augustus’s birthday. The sundial was also integrated in the design of the Mausoleum of Augustus in such a way which illustrated that the entire complex was a cosmic representation of the Principate and the destiny of Augustus, along with his peaceful reign and death.

In the mid-1980s, Schutz and Bandini challenged the erroneous reconstruction. Bandini found several mistakes made by Buchner on interpreting the ancient texts written by Pliny. Pliny referred to a solar meridian, not a sundial. A solar meridian indicates the length of days and nights, therefore reflecting the timing of the solstices. It was used as an instrument to check the congruence of the civil calendar with the solar year. Further archeological findings where a travertine pavement embedded with a line running north to south with Greek lettering in bronze with zodiac signs confirmed Pliny&#x27;s writing. Also, the fact that the site was measured to be about a meter too high to be considered of Augustan date, therefore indicated that the instrument built under Augustus lost its accuracy and was renovated by Domitian.

Schutz then highlighted some technical failures further refuting the previous reconstruction, such as: The erroneous marking of the site where the obelisk lay, the mislabeling of the angles for the relationship between the three monuments and the fact that the gnomon&#x27;s shadow would cast several football fields away from the obelisk due to the sun&#x27;s angle.

It is worth noting, however, that even after those findings, the relevance and the cosmic meaning of the obelisk and the two other monuments constructed under Augustus&#x27;s reign remain correct. The importance of Augustus&#x27;s reign is supported by the evidence that Domitian decided to renovate the instrument and keep it dedicated to Augustus.

===The Ara Pacis===


The Ara Pacis is an altar that was built during the reign of Augustus; begun in 13 BCE, the monument was dedicated in 9 BCE, on Livia&#x27;s birthday. Altars were used for sacrifices to Pagan Gods in Ancient Rome. The Ara Pacis represented Augustus&#x27; goal to represent the era of peace that came with the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire. The south panel depicts a religious process with Augustus, Agrippa, Livia, Tiberius, and others of the Augustan family. The message conveyed was that the Augustan family was to stand the test of time and stay. The north panel depicted the senate in a procession. The message was that the senate was with Augustus instead of against him. The east panel depicts Tellus, the Roman Goddess of the earth and Pax. The message was that Roman people were no longer starving, which was consistent with Augustus’ promise of “peace and fertility”, where he gave land to farmers to plant in the fall and harvest in the spring. The west panel depicts the sacrifice of either Aeneas, the founder of Rome or Numa Pompilius the second king of Rome, it is also where the entrance is located.

===Architectural significance===
The steps leading up to the table on top of the altar represent the ascendence from a public space to a sacred one. Also, the fact that the Ara Pacis did not have a roof or doors and that Gods were depicted looking down from the friezes indicated that the person undertaking vows was looked down upon. When the Senate decreed the building of the Ara Pacis for Augustus, they did not specify any restrictions to the architects. The architects in Ancient Rome used to draw plans with dimensions in proportions and ratios; for instance, the enclosure&#x27;s size and the number of steps were all specific ratios related to the size of the base. The Ara Pacis’ eclectic art leads us to believe that components might have come from other altars in other provinces most likely salvaged on the troops’ way back to Rome.

===Historical discrepancies===
Before Andersen&#x27;s studies, it was assumed that the monument&#x27;s structure was more or less unchanged between its erection and dedication. Andersen relied on evidence from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; and the “Calendar of the Feasts” which depicts Augustus as Pontifex Maximus, a status that he achieved in 12 BCE; his return from the provinces as victor was celebrated with a massive feast during which, as depicted by Ovid, a white bull was slaughtered. But such a feast could not have taken place in the “complete” Ara Pacis; the elevated area was much too small for such a large gathering. Andersen makes a point that the feast actually took place on the foundation of the Ara Pacis, which was then called Ara Fortunae Reducis; at that time, this was simply a plinth on a step base. 
After Lepidus’ death and Augustus&#x27; election as Pontifex Maximus, the building of the complete Ara Pacis began; steps were carved into the plinth, a table was put on top, and friezes were carved onto panels affixed to the walls. Evidence of this historical discrepancy was made evident by Gatti&#x27;s reconstruction plans, which contrasted with Moretti&#x27;s in the lack of moldings for the steps.

==Augustus&#x27; rise to power through building on Campus Martius==
A large portion of events occurring on Campus Martius were associated with either Roman military or Roman electoral or political activities. On it, troops trained for war, and successful generals displayed their riches taken from conquered lands, erecting temples and public buildings to impress the Roman populace in order to curry favor in the elections. In the 30s and 20s B.C.E Rome was experiencing unparalleled growth in public building projects sponsored by many different leading men in the Roman State. In Rome, the sponsorship of these public buildings provided special prestige to each of the individual builders and their families. Augustus, however, expanded past receiving simple prestige, in favor of a much more powerful role. Augustus was amongst numerous builders during the time, but by focusing on the construction of buildings to hold political functions, Augustus was able to occupy a central place in Rome&#x27;s political atmosphere. The first building on Campus Martius to be associated with Augustus was the Saepta Julia, which was designed to manage the crowds at elections and prevent fraud. Voters would gather in the pen space north of the Saepta and enter the structure on its northern end, where they would then cast their ballots. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa completed the Saepta Julia and dedicated it in honor of Augustus. The Pantheon, which was also built by Agrippa and associated with Augustus, was completed within a year of the Saepta Julia and was used for pre-election functions. Agrippa tried to name the Pantheon after Augustus but was denied, instead he erected a statue of Augustus, Julius Caesar and himself in the porch of the Pantheon, forever associating the Pantheon with Augustus, Julius Caesar and Agrippa. So when the crowds gathered to listen to speeches concerning important political events, they did so in buildings dedicated to Augustus, automatically drawing the connection between Augustus and important Roman politics. All of the sites built specifically to host political activities, meetings of the Senate and both legislative and electoral assemblies, were sponsored by or closely associated with Augustus. The ancient Roman historian Strabo describes the presence Augustus left throughout Campus Martius:

As this series of architectural changes occurred following Augustus’ defeat of Mark Antony, Augustus’ association with the new political buildings furthered his rise to political power and status in Rome. Years of civil war from The Great Roman Civil War (49–45 BC) to the Final War of the Roman Republic (32–30 BC) had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Augustus just yet. At the same time Augustus could not give up his authority without risking further civil wars among other Roman generals, and even if he desired no political position, it was his duty to look after the well-being of Rome and Roman provinces. Augustus’ aims from this point forward was to return Rome to a state a stability and civility by lifting the political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections in name at least. Not only did Augustus return the Senate and popular assemblies to their former role, his new buildings on Campus Martius provided the Senate and assemblies with new political homes, all of which were closely associated with Augustus. By willingly restoring the Roman Senate and popular assemblies to their former role and building several monumental politically focused buildings throughout Campus Martius, Augustus permanently connected himself with Rome&#x27;s political atmosphere.

==Religious buildings ==

In the Campus Martius, many public monuments had a religious significance, as they were temples to various gods that were absorbed into the Roman culture. One of the biggest monuments is the temple of Mars Ultor (the avenger) dedicated to Mars, the god of War. It is in the Forum Augustum and is Augustus&#x27;s most ambitious architectural building. The construction started in 30BC and took three decades. The exterior of the temple was constructed using the Italian white Luna marble from Carrara and the columns reflect the Corinthians style. The architecture is strongly influenced by the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in terms of its dimensions (36 meters wide and its length is 50 meters. It was also a political entity aimed at magnifying Augustus role in avenging Caesar’s assassination.

Some of the most significant temples of the campus are the rectangular temples of Largo di Torre Argentina, located in the southern part of the Campus Martius. It is a religious complex composed of four temples: Temple Juturna, Temple Fortuna Huiusce Diei, Temple Feronia, and Temple Lares Permarini. Those temples demonstrate that religious activity is being spread out across Rome and is not focused on the former religious places of the Capitoline Hill or the Forum Romanum. Art historian Stamper argues that the Largo Argentina has marked the beginning of multiple triumphal processions of successful generals. During the 1st century BC, there was a change from the Ionic style to the Corinthian Order. Acanthus leaves were sculpted on the top of these columns.

Two other important temples are the Temple of Apollo Sosianus and the temple of Bellona. One is associated with the cult of Apollo, and the other one is dedicated to the goddess of war, respectively. Both temples are located in the Circus Flaminius and were built during the 2nd century BC. Bellona&#x27;s Temple was rebuilt in marble and travertine with six Corinthian columns along the front and nine along the sides

==Religious events==

The Campus Martius was an area of religious practice. During the Ides of October fall, more specifically the 15th, it was seat of a festival dedicated to Mars takes, the October Horse. This tradition is said to have started during the 6th century B.C. The festival&#x27;s rituals were supposed to protect the coming year&#x27;s crop and the soldiers that had returned to Rome after a campaign. This festival was composed of many stages, including horse chariot races and the sacrifice of a horse followed by the decoration of the severed head with leaves.

Another important religious event was the Secular Games (Latin: ludi saeculares). Established during the Roman Republic, the games were resurrected by emperor Claudius when a man named Valesius prayed for a cure for his children&#x27;s illness and was instructed to sacrifice to the underworld deities. Claudius did this as a way to not only appease the gods after several lightning bolts struck the city of Rome, but to emphasize the birth of a Golden Age. These games were a sort of a rite of passage that were held over several days and nights to mark the end of a new saeculum and the beginning of the next one. A saeculum was supposedly the longest possible length of a human life, either to 100 or 110 years old. The procession started at the Temple of Apollo, near the Circus Flaminius, proceeded into the Forum, passed along to the Vicus Tuscus, Velabrum, through the Forum Boarium, and finally ended at the Temple of Juno Regina. Augustus, when he revived the games, changed the destination of the procession from the Temple of Juno Regina to the Temple of Ceres, which is on the Aventine. The Temple of Apollo that was most likely used was that of Apollo Sosianus, establishing a religious connection between the Aventine and the southwestern Campus.

One of the last events was the Anna Perenna, also celebrated in the Campus Martius during the Ides of March. The people would go out to the Field of Mars for a day of feasting and drinking. According to historian Johannes Lylud, during the festival they also make public and private sacrifice for securing a healthy year.

==The Middle Ages==

After the barbarian invasions cut the aqueducts, the rapidly dwindling population abandoned the surrounding hills and concentrated in the Campus Martius, depending on the Tiber for water, but subject to its flooding. Since it was next to the river and next to the Vatican, the area became the most populous part of Rome in the Middle Ages. The river supported a thriving economy and a supply of water, and the continuous stream of pilgrims to the city brought wealth to the area.

The main road connecting Rome to the rest of Europe was the Via Cassia, entering Rome through the &quot;Porta del Popolo&quot; in the northern part of the Campus Martius. Via Cassia became the most important road in medieval times, because it connected Rome with Viterbo, Siena, and Florence.

The other main road to Rome, the Via Aurelia, became unsafe in medieval times with the spread of malaria, because it passed through the unhealthy marshes near several coastal lakes in the Maremma lowlands (as Orbetello lagoon, Capalbio lake, and other Tombolos), and because its route by the sea made it more susceptible to attack from raiders. The coastal towns around Via Aurelia were areas subjected to kidnapping of women and plunder by Muslim Saracen pirates.

Because of the increasing importance of the area, several popes decided to improve its conditions. In the period 1513–1521, Pope Leo X built a route connecting &quot;Porta del Popolo&quot; to the Vatican. This road was first called the &quot;Via Leonina&quot; after the pope, later the more famous &quot;Via di Ripetta&quot; after the name of the river port. To improve the hygiene of the area, several ancient Roman aqueducts were restored to operating condition.

As the population of Rome greatly increased in the Middle Ages, the Campus Martius became a crowded multi-cultural place where many foreigners settled. In 1555, Pope Paul IV designated part of the southern part of the Campus Martius as the ghetto to contain the city&#x27;s Jewish population.

==Modern Rome==

After the Renaissance, as was the case for the rest of Rome, the Campus Martius did not change much; there were no other great building projects and the population decreased. This was reversed after Rome became capital of the newly established Kingdom of Italy in 1870.

Later, the area became even more crowded, and protecting embankments were built to stop the flooding of the Tiber. This made the area much safer from threat of water, but the tall embankments effectively destroyed the traditional embarkation point called the Ripetta (&quot;little bank&quot;), the narrow streets leading down to the river, and the vernacular buildings along the river edge.
