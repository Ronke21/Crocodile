<text>The family Sciomyzidae belongs to the typical flies (Brachycera) of the order Diptera. They are commonly called marsh flies, and in some cases snail-killing flies due to the food of their larvae.

Here, the Huttoninidae, Phaeomyiidae and Tetanoceridae are provisionally included in the Sciomyzidae. Particularly the latter seem to be an unequivocal part of this group and are ranked as tribe of subfamily Sciomyzinae by most modern authors, while the former two are very small lineages that may or may not stand outside the family and are provisionally ranked as subfamilies here. Whether the Salticellinae and the group around &quot;Sepedon&quot; warrant recognition as additional subfamilies or are better included in the Sciomyzinae proper is likewise not yet entirely clear. Altogether, the main point of contention is the relationship between the &quot;Huttoninidae&quot;, &quot;Phaeomyiidae&quot;, Sciomyzidae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, and the Helosciomyzidae which were also once included in the Sciomyzidae.

Sciomyzidae are found in all the biogeographic realms but are poorly represented in the Australasian and Oceanian realms.

==Description==

Sciomyzidae are small or medium-sized (2–14 mm), usually slender flies with predominantly dull grey, brown, reddish or yellow body, rarely black-lustrous. Wings hyaline, often with dark spots or dark reticulate pattern. The head is semispherical or round. The antennae are usually elongate and the arista is pubescent or has shorter or longer hairs. Ocelli and ocellar bristles are present (absent in &quot;Sepedon&quot;). The postvertical bristles are divergent or parallel. There are one or two pairs of frontal bristles which curve backward (the lower pair sometimes curving inward) Interfrontal bristles are absent but interfrontal setulae are sometimes present. Vibrissae are absent. The wing is clear or with conspicuous markings. The costa is continuous and the subcosta is complete. Crossvein BM-Cu is present and the anal cell (cell cup) is closed. Tibiae almost always have a dorsal preapical bristle.

==Biology==
Marsh flies are common along the edges of ponds and rivers, and in marshy areas. The adults drink dew and nectar. The larvae prey on or become parasites of gastropods (slugs and snails). The occasional sciomyzid attacks snail eggs or fingernail clams. Very little is known about the complete life cycle of these flies but most of the known larvae are semi-aquatic and some are aquatic. Other species have terrestrial larvae. Larvae mainly prey on non-operculate snails. Some species which prey on bivalves have larvae adapted to breathing under water. In some terrestrial species the penultimate larval instar emerges from the snail or slug it developed in. The last instar is then predatory on several snails.

The adults rest on vegetation head down. According to the larval habitat, they are found near water, in marshy vegetation, in woodland or occasionally dry open habitats.

<doc id="422051" wikidata="Q382508" url="?curid=422051" title="District Municipality of Muskoka">
<text>The District Municipality of Muskoka, more generally referred to as the District of Muskoka or Muskoka, is a regional municipality in Central Ontario, Canada. It extends from Georgian Bay in the west, to the northern tip of Lake Couchiching in the south, to the western border of Algonquin Provincial Park in the east. A two-hour drive north of Toronto, it spans . It has some 1,600 lakes, making it a popular cottaging destination.

This region, which, along with Haliburton, Kawartha Lakes, and Peterborough County is referred to as &quot;cottage country&quot;, has over 2.1 million visitors annually. Muskoka is populated with several villages and towns, farming communities, lakeside vacation hotels and resorts near golf courses, country clubs, and marinas. Its regional government seat is Bracebridge and its largest population centre is Huntsville.

Muskoka is geographically within the Central Ontario region of the province, although it is treated as part of Northern Ontario and even Eastern Ontario by some government programs due to its status as a transitional area between the geographic regions.

Muskoka is a summer destination for Toronto residents and was the #1 most searched Canadian destination for vacation rentals in 2017. It was ranked #1 for Best Trips of 2011 by &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and was a finalist for the same distinction in 2012.

The municipality&#x27;s name derives from a First Nations chief of the 1850s. Lake Muskoka was then the hunting grounds of a troop led by Chief Yellowhead or &quot;Mesqua Ukie&quot; or &quot;Musquakie.&quot; He was revered by the government, who built a home for him in Orillia where he lived until his death at age 95.

Muskoka has 60,000 permanent residents, but an additional 100,000 seasonal property owners spend their summers there, making it a major summer colony. Due to the region&#x27;s popularity and high property costs, hundreds of Muskoka properties are available for short-term rental through online platforms.

Many of Muskoka&#x27;s seasonal properties are large summer estates, some of which have been passed down through families for generations. Most of these properties can be found along the shores of Muskoka&#x27;s four major lakes: Lake Muskoka, Lake Rosseau, Lake Joseph and Lake of Bays. In recent years, various Hollywood and sports stars have built retreats in Muskoka, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Mike Weir, Martin Short, Harry Hamlin, Cindy Crawford, and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

==Subdivisions==
There are six municipalities in Muskoka (in descending order of population):

* Town of Huntsville
* Town of Bracebridge
* Town of Gravenhurst
* Township of Muskoka Lakes
* Township of Lake of Bays
* Township of Georgian Bay

The aboriginal reserves Wahta Mohawk Territory and Moose Point 79 are in the Muskoka census division but are independent of the District Municipality.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
Geography drove history in the Muskoka region. Studded with lakes and rocks, the good land offered an abundance of fishing, hunting, and trapping, but was poorly suited to farming. The Muskoka and Haliburton area, with its chain of lakes and rivers, its fur-bearing animals, its fish, wild fruit, and maple sap, would have supported a large Indigenous population, but written evidence suggests that until very recent years it has harboured only nomadic groups. Largely the land of the Ojibwa people, European inhabitants ignored it while settling what they thought were the more promising area south of the Severn River. The Ojibwa leader associated with the area was &quot;Mesqua Ukie&quot;, for whom the land is believed named, as he was liked by the European Canadians. The tribe lived south of the region, near present-day Orillia. They used Muskoka as their hunting grounds. Another Ojibwa tribe lived in the area of Port Carling, then called &quot;Obajewanung&quot;. The tribe moved to Parry Sound around 1866.

In the present day, Muskoka contains four First Nations reserves:

* Wahta Mohawk Territory - an area used for hunting and fishing by Mohawk from the independent Kanesatake and Kahnewake reserves.
* Indian River - shared between the Wahta and the Chippewas of Rama First Nation
* Moose Point 79
* Chippewa Island - shared between the Beausoleil First Nation, the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation and the Chippewas of Rama First Nation

===European arrival===
Until the late 1760s, the European presence in the region was largely limited to seasonal fur trappers, but no significant trading settlements were established. Following the American War of Independence, the British North America government feared invasion from its new neighbour to the south. The authorities began exploring the region, hoping to develop a settled population and find travel lanes between Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay. The first European known to have caught even a glimpse of Muskoka or Haliburton was a French youth, usually identified as Étienne Brûlé, and the year was in 1610 or 1611. In 1826, Lieutenant Henry Briscoe became the first European man known to have crossed the middle of Muskoka. The explorer David Thompson drew the first maps of the area in 1837 and possibly camped near present-day Beaumaris.
Canada experienced heavy immigration from Europe in the 19th century, and Muskoka was no different. Large numbers of settlers from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, Germany began to arrive. As the land south of the Severn was settled, the government planned to open the Muskoka region further north to settlement. Logging licences were issued in 1866 which opened Monck Township to logging.

The lumber industry expanded rapidly, denuding huge tracts of the area. Road and water transportation was developed and used later to facilitate town settlement. Road transportation took the form of the Muskoka Colonization Road, begun in 1858 and reaching Bracebridge in 1861. The road was roughly cut through from the woods and was of corduroy construction. Logs were placed perpendicular to the route of travel to keep carriages from sinking in the mud and swamps. This made for extremely rugged travel.

The railroad pushed north to support the industry, reaching Gravenhurst in 1875 and Bracebridge in 1885. The lumbering industry spawned a number of ancillary developments, with settlements springing up to supply the workers. Bracebridge (formerly North Falls) saw some leather-tanning businesses develop. Tanners used the bark from lumber to tan hides, turning what would otherwise be a waste product to effective use.

===Formation of the Territorial District===
The District was created in 1868, through the withdrawal of townships and unorganized territory from three other jurisdictions:

The townships of Stisted, Chaffey, Franklin and Ridout (all from Victoria County) were transferred to the District in 1873, while Humphrey Township was transferred to the Parry Sound District. In 1876, the boundaries of the District were formally defined by statute:

:* To the south, the middle of the main channel of the Severn River, and a line formed by the southerly boundaries of the townships of Morrison and Ryde, the easterly boundary of Ryde, the southerly boundary of the township of Oakley, the easterly boundary of Oakley, and the southerly boundary of the township of Ridout;
:* To the east, the Bobcaygeon Road and the line surveyed for its continuation;
:* To the north, the southerly boundary of the Territorial District of Parry Sound, and, in that regard, the newly surveyed Conger Township was transferred to Parry Sound; and
:* To the west, the waters of Georgian Bay, including its islands.

Although the townships were part of the District, they were still allied with their original counties for municipal purposes. This was rectified in 1877, when all of the District was declared to be within Simcoe County. This lasted until 1888, when it was separated from that County.

===Settlement===

The passage of the &quot;Free Grants and Homestead Act of 1868&quot;, opened the era of widespread settlement to Muskoka. Settlers could receive free land if they agreed to clear the land, have at least under cultivation, and build a 16x20 ft, or house. Settlers under the Homestead Act, however, found the going hard. Clearing 15 acres of dense forest is a huge task. Once the land was clear, the settlers had to attack Muskoka&#x27;s ubiquitous rocks, which also had to be cleared. Consisting largely of a dense clay, the soil in the region turned out to be poorly suited to farming.

As news of the difficult conditions spread back to the south, development in Muskoka began to falter, but development of the steamship revived industry. In a time when the railroads had not yet arrived and road travel was notoriously unreliable and uncomfortable, the transportation king was the steamship. Once a land connection was made to the southern part of the lake in Gravenhurst, the logging companies could harvest trees along the entire lakefront with relative ease. Steamships gave them the way to ship the harvest back to the sawmills in Gravenhurst.

===The steamship era===
Sometimes called the Father of Muskoka, Alexander Cockburn began placing steamers on the lake system. Starting with his steamship the &quot;Wenonah&quot;, Ojibwa for &quot;first daughter&quot;, in 1866 Cockburn pressed the government to open the entire Muskoka lake system to navigation. He urged installing locks in Port Carling and opening a cut between Lake Rosseau and Lake Joseph at Port Sanfield. The government was eager to reinforce development in light of the faltering agricultural plan, and built the big locks in Port Carling in 1871. Cockburn&#x27;s steamers had access to the entire lake system. Through the years he added more ships; when he died in 1905, his Muskoka Navigation Company was the largest of its kind in Canada.

Shortly after the arrival of the steamships, another industry began to develop as agriculture never could. 1860 two young men, John Campbell and James Bain Jr, made a journey that marked them as perhaps the first tourists in the region. Taking the Northern Railway to Lake Simcoe, they took the steamer &quot;Emily May&quot; up the lake to Orillia, and rowed across Lake Couchiching. They walked up the Colonization Road to Gravenhurst, where they vacationed. They liked what they saw and repeated the journey every year, bringing friends and relatives. These early tourist pioneers increased demand for transport services in the region. People were drawn by the fishing, natural environment, and an air free of ragweed, providing relief for hay fever sufferers.

Early tourists built camps, but were joined by others desiring better accommodations. Farmers who were barely scratching a living from the rocky soil soon found demand for overnight accommodations arriving on their doorsteps. Some made the switch quickly and converted to boarding houses and hotels. The first wilderness hotel, called Rosseau House, was built at the head of Lake Rosseau in 1870. It was owned by New Yorker William H. Pratt. The idea caught on and the number of tourists increased, establishing the tourist industry as the up-and-coming money earner in the 1880s.

The steamship era gave rise to the area&#x27;s great hotels: Rosseau, Royal Muskoka, Windermere, Clevelands House, Beaumaris, and many more. When the railroad reached Gravenhurst in 1875, the area grew rapidly. Travel from Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York City became less a matter of endurance than expenditure. Trains regularly made the run from Toronto to Gravenhurst, where travellers and their luggage were transferred to the great steamers of the Muskoka Navigation Co, such as the &quot;Sagamo&quot;. Making regular stops up the lakes, including at Bracebridge, Beaumaris, and Port Carling, tourists could transfer to smaller ships, such as the &quot;Islander.&quot; These could reach smaller ports. Improving transportation links opened smaller or more remote upper Muskoka lakes (Fairy, Vernon, Mary, Peninsula and Lake of Bays) to tourism around the turn of the 20th century, with steamers out of Huntsville servicing hotels like Deerhurst on Peninsula Lake. The Portage Railway between Peninsula Lake and Lake of Bays enabled comparatively easy access to the latter, resulting in a blossoming of tourism there, with 21 hotels eventually springing up, among them notably the Wawa and Britannia hotels and perhaps culminating in the Bigwin Inn.

The hotels became the centres of wealthy vacationers&#x27; lives, and families conducted extended stays that could stretch for weeks or months in the summer. As families became seasonally established, they began building cottages near the hotels; at first simple affairs replicating the rustic environment of the early camps. Later they built grander homes, including in some cases, housing for significant domestic staff. Initially cottagers relied on rowboats and canoes for daily transport and would sometimes row substantial distances. In the era of the steam and gasoline launch, tourists relied less on muscle power and more on motors. With the boats, the wealthier summer people built boathouses, often elaborate structures in their own right, in many cases designed with the look and feel of the main &quot;cottage&quot;.

In 1887, the &quot;Nipissing II&quot; was built in Glasgow, Scotland and assembled in Gravenhurst, Ontario. Originally a side paddlewheel steamer, the &quot;Nipissing II&quot; plied the lakes of Muskoka for decades before decommission in 1914. In 1924, the vessel was outfitted with twin propeller engines and in 1925 was relaunched with an Ojibwe name, &quot;Segwun&quot;, meaning &quot;springtime.&quot; Royal Mail Ship &quot;Segwun&quot; is still in operation today in Gravenhurst, Ontario, functioning as a pleasure cruise vessel and still delivering mail.

===The coming of the car===
World War I caused a significant dip in the tourist activity for the area and hence the economy. After the war, however, significant advances in the automobile brought demand for improved (paved) roads. These two developments, motorboats and private cars, brought greater overall development of the area; they also stimulated the spread of development around the lakes, as people no longer needed to be near major landings. Freed from the ports of call of the steamships, people built cottages farther afield. Demand began dropping for passenger billets on the steamship lines.

Meanwhile, demand increased for air transportation. The earliest runways of Muskoka Airport were laid out in 1933. The airport has been intermittently upgraded. It was used strategically during World War II as a training field for the Norwegian Air Force after the Nazi occupation of Norway.

The demands of World War II slowed residential development in this area. Wartime shortages kept many Americans at home and many Canadians were engaged in war activities. Postwar prosperity brought another boom based around the availability of the automobile, improved roads, and the newly affordable fiberglass boat. Suddenly owning a summer cottage became possible not only for the adventurous or the wealthy, but for many in the middle class. They traveled by private automobiles, and the steamship companies were forced to retire their ships one by one, until the last sailing in the late 1950s.

===Evolution of local government===
The District was formed from unorganized territory which was only partially surveyed into geographic townships by 1868. Surveying was completed in the coming years, and most, but not all, townships became organized municipally. The first townships were organized in 1869. In 1970, four geographic townships still existed in the District.

In 1873, the organized townships were formed into a municipality similar to a county, known as the &quot;Municipal Corporation of the District of Muskoka.&quot; Its constituent municipalities were:
* Township of Humphrey
* United Townships of Medora and Wood
* United Townships of McLean and Ridout
* United Townships of Stisted, Chaffey, Brunel and Franklin
* United Townships of Cardwell and Watt
* Township of Monck
* Township of Morrison
* United Townships of Draper, Oakley and Ryde
* Township of Macauley
* Township of Stevenson
Its authority did not extend to the geographic townships. Provision was made in 1888 for a procedure to erect the District into a provisional county, but it was never invoked and was quietly repealed in 1911.

The District, unlike a county in Ontario, did not initially have the status of being a separate judicial district. Such an identity followed that for municipal purposes until 1888, when it became part of the &quot;United Provisional Judicial District of Muskoka and Parry Sound&quot;, but it did have its own District Court and Surrogate Court This would continue until 1899, when Muskoka and Parry Sound were divided into separate provisional judicial districts.

In 1967, the Muskoka District Council was advised that J.W. Spooner, Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Municipal Affairs, had appointed Donald M. Paterson to conduct a review of the District&#x27;s local government arrangements. The report was released in June 1969, and its recommendations were substantially adopted by the new Minister Darcy McKeough, and subsequently implemented in January 1971, when the entire District was formally established as an upper-tier municipality consisting of the following municipalities:

<text>An earworm or brainworm, also described as sticky music or stuck song syndrome, is a catchy or memorable piece of music or saying that continuously occupies a person&#x27;s mind even after it is no longer being played or spoken about. Involuntary Musical Imagery (INMI) is most common after earworms, but INMI as a label is not solely restricted to earworms; musical hallucinations also fall into this category, although they are not the same thing. Earworms are considered to be a common type of involuntary cognition. Some of the phrases often used to describe earworms include &quot;musical imagery repetition&quot; and &quot;involuntary musical imagery&quot;.

The word &quot;&quot; is a calque from the German &quot;&quot;. The earliest known English usage is in Desmond Bagley&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Flyaway&quot;, where the author points out the German origin of his word.

Researchers who have studied and written about the phenomenon include Theodor Reik, Sean Bennett, Oliver Sacks, Daniel Levitin, James Kellaris, Philip Beaman, Vicky Williamson, Diana Deutsch, and, in a more theoretical perspective, Peter Szendy, along with many more. The phenomenon is distinct from palinacousis, a rare medical condition caused by damage to the temporal lobe of the brain that results in auditory hallucinations.

==Incidence and causes==

Researcher Vicky Williamson at Goldsmiths, University of London, found in an uncontrolled study that earworms correlated with music exposure, but could also be triggered by experiences that trigger the memory of a song (involuntary memory) such as seeing a word that reminds one of the song, hearing a few notes from the song, or feeling an emotion one associates with the song. The list of songs collected in the study showed no particular pattern, other than popularity.

According to research by James Kellaris, 98% of individuals experience earworms. Women and men experience the phenomenon equally often, but earworms tend to last longer for women and irritate them more. Kellaris produced statistics suggesting that songs with lyrics may account for 73.7% of earworms, whereas instrumental music may cause only 7.7%.

In 2010, published data in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot; directly addressed the subject, and its results support earlier claims that earworms are usually 15 to 30 seconds in length and are more common in those with an interest in music. Earworms can occur with either &#x27;positive&#x27; or &#x27;negative&#x27; music. Positive music in this case is music that sounds happy and/or calm. Negative music is the opposite, where the music sounds angry or sad. 

Earworms are not related only to music with lyrics; in a research experiment conducted by Ella Moeck and her colleagues in an attempt to find out if the positive/negative feeling of a piece of music affected earworms caused by that piece, they used only instrumental music. Her experiment determined that all participants experienced a similar quantity of earworms, regardless of the emotional valence, although the quality of the earworm did vary. The earworms born from the negatively valenced music brought about more distress and occurred less frequently than those produced by positively valenced music.

==Antidotes==
Scientists at Western Washington University found that engaging working memory in moderately difficult tasks such as anagrams, puzzles or reading was an effective way of stopping earworms and of reducing their recurrence. Another publication points out that melodic music has a tendency to demonstrate repeating rhythm which may lead to endless repetition, unless a climax can be achieved to break the cycle.

Research reported in 2015 by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the University of Reading demonstrated that chewing gum could help by similarly blocking the sub-vocal rehearsal component of auditory short-term or &quot;working&quot; memory associated with generating and manipulating auditory and musical images. It has also been suggested to ask oneself why one is experiencing this particular song. Another suggested remedy is to try to find a &quot;cure song&quot; to stop the repeating music.

There are also so-called &quot;cure songs&quot; or &quot;cure tunes&quot; to get the earworm out of one&#x27;s head. &quot;God Save the King&quot; is cited as a very popular and helpful choice of cure song. &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; was also a popular choice in cure songs.

Listening to the tune in a different/lower tempo or lower pitch, or a remixed version if it exists, can be an antidote. 
Listening to the tune from start to finish can also help. Since earworms are usually only a fragment of music, playing the tune all the way through can help break the loop.

==Notable cases==
Jean Harris, who murdered Herman Tarnower, was obsessed with the song &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot; by Allan Roberts and Doris Fisher, which she first heard in the film &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946). She would recall this regularly for over 33 years and could hold a conversation while playing it in her mind.

==In popular culture==
Mark Twain&#x27;s 1876 story &quot;A Literary Nightmare&quot; (also known as &quot;Punch, Brothers, Punch&quot;) is about a jingle that one can get rid of only by transferring it to another person.

In 1943 Henry Kuttner published the short story &quot;Nothing but Gingerbread Left&quot; about a song engineered to damage the Nazi war effort, culminating in Adolf Hitler being unable to continue a speech.

In Alfred Bester&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;, the protagonist uses a jingle specifically crafted to be a catchy, irritating nuisance as a tool to block mind readers from reading his mind.

In Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1957 science fiction short story &quot;The Ultimate Melody&quot;, a scientist, Gilbert Lister, develops the ultimate melody – one that so compels the brain that its listener becomes completely and forever enraptured by it. As the storyteller, Harry Purvis, explains, Lister theorized that a great melody &quot;made its impression on the mind because it fitted in with the fundamental electrical rhythms going on in the brain.&quot; Lister attempts to abstract from the hit tunes of the day to a melody that fits in so well with the electrical rhythms that it dominates them completely. He succeeds and is found in a catatonic state from which he never awakens.

In Fritz Leiber&#x27;s Hugo Award-nominated short story &quot;Rump-Titty-Titty-Tum-TAH-Tee&quot; (1959), the title describes a rhythmic drumbeat so powerful that it rapidly spreads to all areas of human culture, until a counter-rhythm is developed that acts as an antidote.

In Joe Simpson&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;Touching the Void&quot;, he talks about not being able to get the tune &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; by Boney M out of his head. The book tells of his survival, against the odds, after a mountaineering accident in the remote Siula Grande region of South America. Alone, badly injured, and in a semi-delirious state, he is confused as to whether he is imagining the music or really hearing it.

In the &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; episode titled &quot;Head Band&quot;, a contagious group of viruses force their host to sing what they are saying to the same &quot;boy band&quot; tune. The only way to be cured of the Boy Band Virus is for the viruses to break up and start their own solo careers.

In the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode titled “Earworm”, SpongeBob gets the “Musical Doodle” song stuck in his head, giving him an earworm, which ultimately turns out to be an actual worm, which is removed by his friends singing or playing other songs.

In &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot; there is a scene in which most of the film&#x27;s characters are subjected to &quot;Catchy Song&quot; and all except Lucy dance to it, while simultaneously the denizens of Harmony Town sing it to Emmet and Rex. Lucy/Wildstyle avoids being &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the song by breaking one of the speakers and using some of its pieces to build earmuffs for herself before escaping via air ducts, while Emmet and Rex escape in a similar fashion.

E. B. White&#x27;s 1933 satirical short story &quot;The Supremacy of Uruguay&quot; (reprinted in &quot;Timeless Stories for Today and Tomorrow&quot;) relates a fictional episode in the history of Uruguay where a powerful earworm is discovered in a popular American song. The Uruguayan military builds a squadron of pilotless aircraft armed with phonographs playing a highly amplified recording of the earworm, and conquers the entire world by reducing the citizens of all nations to mindless insanity. &quot;[T]he peoples were hopelessly mad, ravaged by an ineradicable noise ... No one could hear anything except the noise in his own head.&quot;

In 2014, musician Emperor X wrote a deliberately catchy song titled &quot;10,000-Year Earworm to Discourage Settlement Near Nuclear Waste Repositories (Don&#x27;t Change Color, Kitty)&quot; in reference to the &quot;ray cat&quot; idea in nuclear semiotics, attempting to embed a warning message in folklore that would still be remembered in 10,000 years&#x27; time.

In 2023–2024, an &quot;earworm eraser&quot; clip created by Atlassian was popularized on social media.

== Key characteristics ==
According to research done in 2016 by Kelly Jakubowski and colleagues, published by the American Psychological Association, there are certain characteristics that make songs more likely to become earworms. Earworm songs usually have a fast-paced tempo and an easy-to-remember melody. However, earworms also tend to have unusual intervals or repetitions that make them stand out from other songs. Earworms also tend to be played on the radio more than other songs and are usually featured at the top of the charts. The chorus of a song is one of the most reported causes of earworms.

The most frequently named earworms during this study were the following:

# &quot;Bad Romance&quot; by Lady Gaga
# &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; by Kylie Minogue
# &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; by Journey
# &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know&quot; by Gotye
# &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot; by Maroon 5
# &quot;California Gurls&quot; by Katy Perry
# &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen
# &quot;Alejandro&quot; by Lady Gaga
# &quot;Poker Face&quot; by Lady Gaga

== Susceptible traits ==
Kazumasa Negishi and Takahiro Sekiguchi did a study to see if there are specific traits that make a person more or less susceptible to earworms or involuntary musical imagery. The participants in the study were assessed on obsessive-compulsive tendencies, the Big Five personality traits, and musical expertise. Negishi and Sekiguchi found that some of the obsessive-compulsive traits, such as intrusive thoughts, played a role in experiencing earworms while compulsive washing did not. In terms of the Big Five personality traits, neuroticism significantly predicted occurrences of earworms. Musical expertise created an effect of sophistication when it came to earworm occurrences.

== Tools used in data gathering ==
One tool used to gather data on involuntary musical imagery (INMI)—and, more specifically, earworms—is called the Involuntary Musical Imagery Scale; it was created with the research compiled from George Floridou, Victoria Williamson, and Danial Müllensiefen. It uses four factors to measure different experiences surrounding earworms and INMI in general. Those four factors include &#x27;Negative Valence&#x27;, &#x27;Movement&#x27;, &#x27;Personal Reflections&#x27;, and &#x27;Help&#x27;. Negative Valence is the category that measures the subjective response to the INMI experience. Movement is a relatively new aspect to apply to INMI, it is essentially the INMI experience with accompanied embodied responses, which can include singing, humming, and dancing. Personal Reflections is the occurrence of a personal quality, like unrelated thoughts, associated with the INMI; which are not directly related to the valence of the INMI itself. Help is the category which determines the beneficial and constructive aspects to the INMI experiences, which could potentially reflect similarities in the characteristics of unfocused music listing and task-unrelated thought.

<doc id="422079" wikidata="Q7700684" url="?curid=422079" title="Tension myositis syndrome">
<text>Tension myositis syndrome (TMS), also known as tension myoneural syndrome or mindbody syndrome, is a name given by John E. Sarno to what he claimed was a condition of musculoskeletal and nerve symptoms, most notably back pain. Sarno described TMS in four books, and stated that the condition may be involved in other pain disorders as well. The treatment protocol for TMS includes education, writing about emotional issues, resumption of a normal lifestyle and, for some patients, support meetings and/or psychotherapy. 

The TMS diagnosis and treatment protocol are not accepted by the mainstream medical community.

==Conceptual basis==
According to Sarno, TMS is a condition in which unconscious emotional issues (primarily rage, though other practitioners include other subconscious emotional issues such as anxiety, past trauma, and fear) initiate a process that causes physical pain and other symptoms. His theory suggests that the unconscious mind uses the autonomic nervous system to decrease blood flow to muscles, nerves or tendons, resulting in oxygen deprivation (temporary micro-ischemia) and metabolite accumulation, experienced as pain in the affected tissues. Sarno theorized that because patients often report that back pain seems to move around, up and down the spine, or from side to side, that this implies the pain may not be caused by a physical deformity or injury.

Sarno stated that the underlying cause of the pain is the mind&#x27;s defense mechanism against unconscious mental stress and emotions such as anger, anxiety and narcissistic rage. The conscious mind is distracted by the physical pain, as the psychological repression process keeps the anger and rage contained in the unconscious and thereby prevented from entering conscious awareness. Sarno believed that when patients recognize that the symptoms are only a distraction, the symptoms then serve no purpose and subsequently go away. TMS can be considered a psychosomatic condition and has been referred to as a &quot;distraction pain syndrome.&quot;

Sarno was a vocal critic of conventional medicine with regard to diagnosis and treatment of back pain, which is often treated by rest, physical therapy, exercise and/or surgery.

==Symptoms==
Back pain is frequently mentioned as a TMS symptom, but Sarno defined TMS symptoms much more broadly:
* &quot;Symptom type:&quot; TMS symptoms include pain, stiffness, weakness, tingling, numbness, muscle contractures, cramps and other negative sensations, according to Sarno.
* &quot;Symptom location:&quot; In addition to the back, Sarno stated that TMS symptoms can occur in the neck, knee, arms, wrists, and other parts of the body. Schechter states that the symptoms have a tendency to move to other parts of the body. He considers symptom movement an important indicator that the pain is from TMS.

==Diagnosis==
Below is a list of criteria for diagnosing TMS, according to Schechter and Sarno:
* &quot;Lack of known physical cause:&quot; Schechter and Sarno state that a physical examination, tests and imaging studies is needed to rule out serious conditions, such as tumors. Sarno considers spinal disc herniations to generally be harmless, because he says the symptom location does not even correlate to the herniation location.
* &quot;Tender points:&quot; While medical doctors use eleven of eighteen tender points as a diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, Sarno states that he uses six main tender points to diagnose TMS: two tender points in the upper trapezius muscles, two in the lumbar paraspinal muscles and two in the lateral upper buttocks. He states that these are found in 99% of TMS patients.
* &quot;History of other psychosomatic disorders:&quot; Schechter and Sarno consider a prior history of other psychosomatic disorders an indication that the patient may have TMS. They list irritable bowel syndrome and tension headache as examples of psychosomatic disorders.

Schechter and Sarno state that if a patient is unable to visit a medical doctor who is trained in TMS, then the patient should see a traditional medical doctor to rule out serious disorders, such as fractures, tumors and infections.

== Treatment ==
Sarno recommended ignoring chronic muscular-skeletal pain, and living everyday life as if there was none.

==Notable patients==
Notable people who have been treated for TMS include the following:
* Radio personality Howard Stern credited TMS treatment with the relief of his &quot;excruciating back and shoulder pain&quot;, as well as his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
* &quot;20/20&quot; co-anchor John Stossel was treated by Sarno for his chronic debilitating back pain. In a &quot;20/20&quot; segment on his former doctor, Stossel stated his opinion that the TMS treatment &quot;cured&quot; his back pain, although he admitted that he continues to have relapses of pain.
* Television writer and producer Janette Barber said that for three years, she had been increasingly unable to walk, and eventually began to use a wheelchair, due to severe ankle pain originally diagnosed as tendinitis. She was later diagnosed and treated for TMS. According to Barber, she was &quot;pain-free one week after [Sarno&#x27;s] lecture&quot; and able to walk and run within a few months, notwithstanding her &quot;occasional&quot; relapses of pain.
* The late actress Anne Bancroft said that she saw several doctors for back pain, but only Sarno&#x27;s TMS treatment helped her.
* The acclaimed filmmaker Terry Zwigoff said he was on the verge of suicide due to his debilitating back pain, until he turned in desperation to Sarno&#x27;s method and it &quot;saved [his] life&quot;, as well as the life of a woman he told about it more recently.

==Reception==
The TMS diagnosis and treatment protocol are not accepted by the mainstream medical community. Sarno himself stated in a 2004 interview with &quot;Medscape Orthopaedics &amp; Sports Medicine&quot; that &quot;99.999% of the medical profession does not accept this diagnosis.&quot; Although the vast majority of medical doctors do not accept TMS, there are doctors who do. Andrew Weil, an alternative medicine proponent, endorses TMS treatment for back pain. Mehmet Oz, a television personality and Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, includes TMS treatment in his four recommendations for treating back pain. Richard E. Sall, a medical doctor who authored a book on worker&#x27;s compensation, includes TMS in a list of conditions he considers possible causes of back pain resulting in missed work days that increase the costs of worker&#x27;s compensation programs.

Patients typically see their doctor when the pain is at its worst and pain chart scores statistically improve over time even if left untreated; most people recover from an episode of back pain within weeks without any medical intervention at all. The TMS theory has also been criticized as too simplistic to account for the complexity of pain syndromes. James Rainville, a medical doctor at New England Baptist Hospital, said that while TMS treatment works for some patients, Sarno mistakenly uses the TMS diagnosis for other patients who have real physical problems.

Gilbert graduated from Yale University in 1997, with honors, majoring in art with an emphasis on photography.

== Career ==
=== Television ===
Following appearances in television movies and a commercial for Kool-Aid, at 13 she landed the role of Darlene Conner, the sarcastic middle child, in &quot;Roseanne&quot;. Gilbert was a cast member in the show&#x27;s nine-year run (1988–97), for which she wrote a fourth-season episode story (the teleplay was written by the Guild Writers for the show) called &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over.&quot; Her contribution was considered so important to &quot;Roseanne&quot; that the show&#x27;s producers juggled storylines and taping schedules to allow her to study at Yale University while remaining in the cast, shooting remote segments of Darlene at a soundstage in New York.

Gilbert has appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Private Practice&quot;. Starting in 2004, she had a recurring role as smart and sarcastic medical student Jane Figler on the long-running hospital drama &quot;ER&quot;; her appearances spanned seasons 11–13.

Gilbert regained a regular spot on prime time television in the fall of 2005 in the sitcom &quot;Twins&quot; on The WB network. The show was canceled after one season, when the WB and UPN networks merged as The CW and dropped a number of series. She also had a recurring role on the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;The Class&quot; as Fern Velch.

From 2007 to 2010, Gilbert appeared in episodes of the CBS TV series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; as Leslie Winkle, a scientist friend of Leonard Hofstadter played by Johnny Galecki, who had previously played Gilbert&#x27;s love interest David Healy on &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In the second episode of the second season of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, Gilbert was elevated to the show&#x27;s main cast, portraying again a potential love interest of Galecki&#x27;s character, and at one point a love interest to Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg). By January 2009, it was announced that the writers did not know how to write for her character full-time, and her status was reduced from regular to recurring. Winkle was discontinued after Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette Rostenkowski became prominent characters.

Gilbert was a co-host and executive producer of &quot;The Talk&quot;, a talk show that premiered October 18, 2010. Gilbert won a Daytime Emmy in 2016 for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show as producer and creator of the show. Her final appearance as co-host was August 2, 2019.

An eight-episode revival series of &quot;Roseanne&quot; was developed, with Gilbert as an executive producer. The eight episodes, picked up by ABC, began airing March 27, 2018. Due to the revival&#x27;s strong ratings and positive critical reception, a second season was announced. However, on May 29, 2018, in the wake of controversial remarks made by Barr on Twitter regarding Valerie Jarrett (an advisor to former president Barack Obama), ABC cancelled the revival after a single season. Gilbert distanced herself and the show from Barr&#x27;s tweets.

On June 21, 2018, ABC announced that the network had ordered ten episodes of a spin-off of &quot;Roseanne&quot;. That series, &quot;The Conners&quot;, featuring all of the regular cast except Barr, premiered in October 2018, with Gilbert starring and serving as an executive producer. In 2019, Sara, along with Tom Werner launched Sara+Tom, by combining two companies, her Gilbert TV arm, and Werner Entertainment, both of which worked after the success of &quot;The Conners&quot;.

Sara Gilbert is one of the executive producers of the show titled &#x27;The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh&#x27;. The eight-episode half-hour series is produced by Sony Pictures Television and Amazon Studios.

=== Film ===
Gilbert appeared in two films alongside Drew Barrymore, in &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; in 2001. Gilbert also had a feature role in &quot;Light It Up&quot; in 1999. She has had several minor roles following &quot;Roseanne&quot;, including the short film &quot;$30&quot; (aka &quot;30 Bucks&quot;) as part of the &quot;Boys Life 3&quot; feature, and &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. She directed her short film &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot; in 1998. In 2000, Gilbert appeared in a production of &quot;The Hot L Baltimore&quot; as part of the Williamstown (Mass.) theater festival.

== Personal life ==

As a teenager, Gilbert dated her &quot;Roseanne&quot; (and later &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;) co-star Johnny Galecki (their characters also dated). During their relationship she realized she was a lesbian. She remains close friends with Galecki.

In 2001, Gilbert began a relationship with television producer Ali Adler. They have two children—a son, Levi Hank, born to Adler in October 2004, and a daughter, Sawyer Jane, born to Gilbert in August 2007. For many years, Gilbert remained private about her sexuality, choosing not to publicly discuss her personal life. In July 2010, as she prepared to launch her talk show, &quot;The Talk&quot;, Gilbert confirmed that she was a lesbian. In August 2011, Gilbert announced that she and Adler had separated amicably.

Following the breakup, Gilbert began a relationship with songwriter, music producer and former 4 Non Blondes frontwoman Linda Perry. Gilbert announced their engagement in April 2013, and the pair married on March 30, 2014. Gilbert gave birth to their son, Rhodes Emilio Gilbert Perry, on February 28, 2015. On December 27, 2019, Gilbert filed for legal separation from Perry.

<doc id="422111" wikidata="Q1145378" url="?curid=422111" title="Operation Flavius">
<text>Operation Flavius (also referred to as the Gibraltar killings) was a military operation in which three members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) were shot dead by the British Special Air Service (SAS) in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988. The trio were believed to be planning a car bomb attack on British military personnel in Gibraltar. They were shot dead while leaving the territory, having parked a car. All three were found to be unarmed, and no bomb was discovered in the car, leading to accusations that the British government had conspired to murder them. An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the authorities had acted lawfully but the European Court of Human Rights held that, although there had been no conspiracy, the planning and control of the operation was so flawed as to make the use of lethal force almost inevitable. The deaths were the first in a chain of violent events in a fourteen-day period. On 16 March, the funeral of the three IRA members was attacked, leaving three mourners dead. At the funeral of one, two British soldiers were murdered after driving into the procession in error.

In late 1987, British authorities became aware of an IRA plan to detonate a bomb outside the governor&#x27;s residence in Gibraltar. On the day of the shootings, known IRA member Seán Savage was seen parking a car near the assembly area for the parade; fellow members Daniel McCann and Mairéad Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards. As SAS personnel moved to intercept the three, Savage split from McCann and Farrell and ran south. Two soldiers pursued Savage while two others approached McCann and Farrell. The soldiers reported seeing the IRA members make threatening movements when challenged, so the soldiers shot them multiple times. All three were found to be unarmed, and Savage&#x27;s car did not contain a bomb, though a second car, containing explosives, was later found in Spain. Two months after the shootings, the documentary &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was broadcast on British television. Using reconstructions and eyewitness accounts, it presented the possibility that the three IRA members had been unlawfully killed.

The inquest into the deaths began in September 1988. The authorities stated that the IRA team had been tracked to Málaga, where they were lost by the Spanish police, and that the three did not re-emerge until Savage was seen parking his car in Gibraltar. The soldiers testified that they believed the suspected bombers had been reaching for weapons or a remote detonator. Several eyewitnesses recalled seeing the three shot without warning, with their hands up, or while they were on the ground. One witness, who told &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; he saw a soldier fire at Savage repeatedly while he was on the ground, retracted his statement at the inquest, prompting an inquiry into the programme which largely vindicated it. The inquest returned a verdict of lawful killing. Dissatisfied, the families took the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Delivering its judgement in 1995, the court found that the operation had been in violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights as the authorities&#x27; failure to arrest the suspects at the border, combined with the information given to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. The decision is cited as a landmark case in the use of force by the state.

==Background==
The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) aimed to establish a united Ireland and end the British administration of Northern Ireland through the use of force. The organisation was the result of a 1969 split in the Irish Republican Army; the other group, the Official IRA, ceased paramilitary activity in the 1970s. The IRA killed civilians, members of the armed forces, police, judiciary and prison service, including off-duty and retired members, and bombed businesses and military targets in both Northern Ireland and England, with the aim of making Northern Ireland ungovernable. Daniel McCann, Seán Savage, and Mairéad Farrell were, according to the journalist Brendan O&#x27;Brien, &quot;three of the IRA&#x27;s most senior activists&quot;. Savage was an explosives expert and McCann was &quot;a high-ranking intelligence operative&quot;; both McCann and Farrell had previously served prison sentences for offences relating to explosives.

The Special Air Service is part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s special forces. The SAS was first assigned to operations in Northern Ireland in the early stages of the British Army&#x27;s deployment there, but were confined to South Armagh. More widespread deployment of the SAS began in 1976, when D Squadron was committed. The SAS specialised in covert, intelligence-based operations against the IRA, using more aggressive tactics than regular army and police units.

==Build-up==
From late 1987, the British authorities were aware that the IRA was planning an attack in Gibraltar. The intelligence appeared to be confirmed in November 1987, when several known IRA members were detected travelling from Belfast to Spain under false identities. MI5—the British Security Service—and the Spanish authorities became aware that an IRA active service unit (ASU) was operating from the Costa del Sol and the members of the unit were placed under surveillance. After a known IRA member was sighted at the changing of the guard ceremony at the Convent (the governor&#x27;s residence) in Gibraltar, the authorities suspected that the IRA was planning to attack the British soldiers with a car bomb as they assembled for the ceremony in a nearby car park. In an attempt to confirm the IRA&#x27;s intended target, the government of Gibraltar suspended the ceremony in December 1987, citing a need to repaint the guardhouse. They believed their suspicions were confirmed when the IRA member re-appeared at the ceremony in February 1988.
In the following weeks, Savage, McCann, and Farrell travelled to Málaga ( along the coast from Gibraltar), where they each rented a car. Their activities were monitored and by early March, the British authorities were convinced that an IRA attack was imminent; a team from the SAS was despatched to the territory, apparently with the personal approval of the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Before the operation, the SAS practised arrest techniques, while the Gibraltar authorities searched for a suitable place to hold the would-be bombers after their arrest. The plan was that the SAS would assist the Gibraltar Police in arresting the IRA members—identified by MI5 officers who had been in Gibraltar for several weeks—if they were seen parking a car in Gibraltar and then attempting to leave the territory.

==Events of 6 March==
According to the official account of the operation, Savage entered Gibraltar undetected at 12:45 (CET; UTC+1) on 6 March 1988 in a white Renault 5. An MI5 officer recognised him and he was followed, but he was not positively identified for almost an hour and a half, during which time he parked the vehicle in the car park used as the assembly area for the changing of the guard. At 14:30, McCann and Farrell were observed crossing the frontier from Spain and were also followed. They met Savage in the car park at around 14:50 and a few minutes later the three began walking through the town. After the three left the car park, &quot;Soldier G&quot;, a bomb-disposal officer, examined Savage&#x27;s car and reported that the vehicle should be treated as a possible car bomb. Soldier G&#x27;s suspicion was conveyed as certainty to four SAS troopers, Soldiers &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;. Gibraltar Police Commissioner Joseph Canepa handed control of the operation to &quot;Soldier F&quot;, the senior SAS officer, at 15:40. Two minutes later, the SAS moved to intercept the IRA operatives as they walked north on Winston Churchill Avenue towards the Spanish border. As the soldiers approached, the suspects appeared to realise that they were being followed. Savage split from the group and began heading south, brushing against &quot;Soldier A&quot; as he did so; &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; stayed with McCann and Farrell and Soldiers &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; followed Savage.

At the same time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making arrangements for the IRA members once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte&#x27;s driver activated the siren on the police car to expedite the journey, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were about to challenge them, outside the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue.

&quot;Soldier A&quot; stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who &quot;A&quot; was; &quot;A&quot; testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but &quot;events overtook the warning&quot;: that McCann&#x27;s right arm &quot;moved aggressively across the front of his body&quot;, leading &quot;A&quot; to believe that McCann was reaching for a remote detonator. &quot;A&quot; shot McCann once in the back; he told the inquest he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. He shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). &quot;Soldier B&quot; testified that he reached similar conclusions to &quot;A&quot;, and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. &quot;Soldier C&quot; testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at the same time as &quot;C&quot; shouted &quot;Stop!&quot;; &quot;C&quot; stated that he believed Savage was reaching for a remote detonator and so opened fire. &quot;C&quot; shot Savage six times, while &quot;Soldier D&quot; fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers&#x27; bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.

Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers donned berets to identify themselves. Gibraltar Police officers, including Inspector Revagliatte and his men, began to arrive at the scene almost immediately. At 16:05, 25 minutes after assuming control, the SAS commander handed control of the operation back to the Gibraltar Police in a document stating: &quot;A military assault force completed the military option in respect of the terrorist ASU in Gibraltar and returns control to the civil power.&quot; Soldiers and police officers evacuated buildings in the vicinity of the Convent and bomb-disposal experts were brought in. Four hours later, the authorities announced that a car bomb had been defused. The SAS personnel left Gibraltar by military aircraft the same day.

When the bodies were searched, a set of car keys was found on Farrell. Spanish and British authorities conducted enquiries to trace the vehicle, which—two days after the shootings—led them to a red Ford Fiesta in a car park in Marbella ( from Gibraltar). The car contained a large quantity of Semtex surrounded by 200 rounds of ammunition, along with four detonators and two timers.

==Reaction==
Within minutes, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a press release that &quot;a suspected car bomb has been found in Gibraltar, and three suspects have been shot dead by the civilian police&quot;. That evening, both the BBC and ITN reported that the IRA team had been involved in a &quot;shootout&quot; with the authorities. The following morning, BBC Radio 4 reported that the alleged bomb was &quot;packed with bits of metal and shrapnel&quot;, and later carried a statement from Ian Stewart, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, that &quot;military personnel were involved. A car bomb was found, which has been defused&quot;. All eleven British daily newspapers reported the alleged finding of the car bomb, of which eight quoted its size as . The IRA issued a statement later on 7 March to the effect that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were &quot;on active service&quot; in Gibraltar and had &quot;access to and control over &quot; of Semtex.

According to one case study of the incident, it &quot;provide[d] an opportunity to examine the ideological functioning of the news media within [the Troubles]&quot;. The British broadsheet newspapers all exhibited what the authors called &quot;ideological closure&quot; by marginalising the IRA and extolling the SAS. Several papers focused on the size of the alleged bomb and the devastation it could have caused without questioning the government&#x27;s version of events. At 15:30 (GMT) on 7 March, the foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, made a statement to the House of Commons:

Shortly before 1:00 p.m. yesterday, afternoon [Savage] brought a white Renault car into Gibraltar and was seen to park it in the area where the guard mounting ceremony assembles. Before leaving the car, he was seen to spend some time making adjustments in the vehicle

An hour and a half later, [McCann and Farrell] were seen to enter Gibraltar on foot and shortly before 3:00 p.m., joined [Savage] in the town. Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicions that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car.

About 3:30 p.m., all three left the scene and started to walk back towards the border. On their way to the border, they were challenged by the security forces. When challenged, they made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat. In light of this response, they [the IRA members] were shot. Those killed were subsequently found not to have been carrying arms.

The parked Renault car was subsequently dealt with by a military bomb-disposal team. It has now been established that it did not contain an explosive device.

Press coverage in the following days, after Howe&#x27;s statement that no bomb had been found, continued to focus on the act planned by the IRA; several newspapers reported a search for a fourth member of the team. Reports of the discovery of the bomb in Marbella appeared to vindicate the government&#x27;s version of events and justify the killings. Several MPs made statements critical of the operation, while a group of Labour MPs tabled a condemnatory motion.

==Aftermath==

The IRA notified the McCann, Savage, and Farrell families of the deaths on the evening of 6 March, and the following day publicly announced that the three were members of the IRA. A senior member of Sinn Féin, Joe Austin, was tasked with recovering the bodies. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (Mairéad Farrell&#x27;s brother) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. At the border, the Northern Irish authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between police and members of the procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage&#x27;s hearse.

The animosity continued until the procession split to allow the hearses to travel to the respective family homes. British soldiers and police flooded the neighbourhoods to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at.

The joint funeral of McCann, Farrell and Savage took place on 16 March at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) agreed to maintain a minimal presence at the funeral in exchange for guarantees from the families that there would be no salute by masked gunmen. This agreement was leaked to Michael Stone, who described himself as a &quot;freelance Loyalist paramilitary&quot;. During the burial, Stone threw grenades into the crowd and began shooting with an automatic pistol, injuring 60 people. Several mourners chased Stone, throwing rocks and shouting abuse. Stone continued shooting and throwing grenades at his pursuers, killing three of them. He was eventually captured after being chased onto a road and the pursuers beat him until the RUC arrived to extract and arrest him.

The funeral of Caoimhín Mac Brádaigh (Kevin Brady), the third and last of the Milltown attack victims to be buried, was scheduled for 19 March. As his cortège proceeded along Andersontown Road, a car driven by two undercover British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, sped past stewards and drove into the path of the cortège. The corporals attempted to reverse, but were blocked in and a hostile crowd surrounded their car. As members of the crowd began to break into the vehicle, one of the corporals drew and fired a pistol, which momentarily subdued the crowd, before both men were dragged from the car, beaten and disarmed. A local priest intervened to stop the beating, but was pulled away when a military identity card was found, raising speculation that the corporals were SAS members. The two were bundled into a taxi, driven to waste ground by IRA members and beaten further. Six men were seen leaving the vehicle. Another IRA man arrived with a pistol taken from one of the soldiers, with which he repeatedly shot the corporals before handing the weapon to another man, who shot the corporals&#x27; bodies multiple times. Margaret Thatcher described the corporals&#x27; killings as the &quot;single most horrifying event in Northern Ireland&quot; during her premiership.

The corporals&#x27; shootings sparked the largest criminal investigation in Northern Ireland&#x27;s history, which created fresh tension in Belfast as republicans saw what they believed was a disparity in the efforts the RUC expended in investigating the corporals&#x27; murders compared with those of republican civilians. Over four years, more than 200 people were arrested in connection with the killings, of whom 41 were charged with a variety of offences. The first of the so-named Casement Trials concluded quickly; two men were found guilty of murder and given life sentences in the face of overwhelming evidence. Of the trials that followed, many proved much more controversial.

==&quot;Death on the Rock&quot;==
On 28 April 1988, almost two months after the Gibraltar shootings, ITV broadcast an episode of its current affairs series &quot;This Week&quot;, titled &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;. &quot;This Week&quot; sent three journalists to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shootings in Spain and Gibraltar. Using eyewitness accounts, and with the cooperation of the Spanish authorities, the documentary reconstructed the events leading up to the shootings; the Spanish police assisted in the reconstruction of the surveillance operation mounted against the IRA members in the weeks before 6 March, and the journalists hired a helicopter to film the route. In Gibraltar, they located several new eyewitnesses to the shootings, who each said they had seen McCann, Savage, and Farrell shot without warning or shot after they had fallen to the ground; most agreed to be filmed and provided signed statements. One witness, Kenneth Asquez, provided two near-identical statements through intermediaries, but refused to meet with the journalists or sign either statement. The journalists eventually incorporated his account of seeing Savage shot while on the ground into the programme.

For technical advice, the journalists engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, a retired British Army officer who was regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed that it would have been obvious to the authorities that Savage&#x27;s car did not contain a bomb as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle&#x27;s springs; he also believed that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. The government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, so the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who opined that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.

Two days before the programme was scheduled for broadcast, Sir Geoffrey Howe telephoned the chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to request that the authority delay the broadcast until after the inquest on the grounds that it risked prejudicing the proceedings. After viewing the programme and taking legal advice, the IBA decided on the morning of 28 April that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; should be broadcast as scheduled. Howe made further representation that the documentary would be in contempt of the inquest, but the IBA upheld its decision.

The programme was broadcast at 9 p.m. on 28 April and attracted considerable controversy. The following morning, the British tabloid newspapers lambasted the programme, describing it as a &quot;slur&quot; on the SAS and &quot;trial by television&quot;; several criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. Over the following weeks, newspapers repeatedly printed stories about the documentary&#x27;s witnesses, in particular Carmen Proetta, who reported seeing McCann and Farrell shot without warning by soldiers who arrived in a Gibraltar Police car. Proetta sued several newspapers for libel and won substantial damages. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; conducted its own investigation and reported that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; had misrepresented the views of its witnesses; those involved later complained to other newspapers that &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had distorted their comments.

==Inquest==
Unusually for Gibraltar, there was a long delay between the shootings and the setting of a date for the inquest (the usual method for investigating sudden or controversial deaths in parts of the United Kingdom and its territories); eight weeks after the shootings, the coroner, Felix Pizzarello, announced that the inquest would begin on 27 June 1988. Two weeks later (unknown to Pizzarello), Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s press secretary announced that the inquest had been indefinitely postponed.

The inquest began on 6 September. Pizzarello presided over the proceedings, while eleven jurors evaluated the evidence; representing the Gibraltar government was Eric Thislewaite, the Gibraltar attorney general. The interested parties were represented by John Laws, QC (for the British government), Michael Hucker (for the SAS personnel), and Patrick McGrory (for the families of McCann, Farrell, and Savage). Inquests are non-adversarial proceedings aimed at investigating the circumstances of a death; the investigation is conducted by the coroner, while the representatives of interested parties can cross-examine witnesses. Where the death occurred through the deliberate action of another person, the jury can return a verdict of &quot;lawful killing&quot;, &quot;unlawful killing&quot;, or an &quot;open verdict&quot;; though inquests cannot apportion blame, in the case of a verdict of unlawful killing the authorities will consider whether any prosecutions should be brought.

The soldiers and MI5 officers gave their evidence anonymously and from behind a screen. As the inquest began, observers including Amnesty International expressed concern that McGrory was at a disadvantage, as all of the other lawyers were privy to the evidence of the SAS and MI5 personnel before it was given. The cost of the transcript for each day&#x27;s proceedings was increased ten-fold the day before the inquest began. The inquest heard from 79 witnesses, including police, MI5, and SAS soldiers as well as technical experts and eyewitnesses.

===Police, military, and MI5 witnesses===
The first witnesses to testify were Gibraltar Police officers. Following them was &quot;Mr O&quot;, the senior MI5 officer in charge of Operation Flavius. &quot;O&quot; told the inquest that, in January 1988, Belgian authorities found a car being used by IRA operatives in Brussels. In the car were found a quantity of Semtex, detonators, and equipment for a radio detonation device, which led MI5 to the conclusion that the IRA might use a similar device for the planned attack in Gibraltar. MI5 believed that the IRA had been unlikely to use a &quot;blocking car&quot; (an empty vehicle used to hold a parking space until the bombers bring in the vehicle containing the explosives) as this entailed the added risk of multiple border crossings. &quot;O&quot; told the coroner that McCann, Savage, and Farrell had been observed by Spanish authorities arriving at Málaga Airport but had been lost shortly afterwards and were not detected crossing into Gibraltar.

Canepa told the inquest that (contrary to McGrory&#x27;s assertions) there had been no conspiracy to kill McCann, Savage, and Farrell. He stated that, upon learning of the IRA plot from MI5, he set up an advisory committee consisting of MI5, military, and police personnel. As events developed, the committee decided that the Gibraltar Police was not adequately equipped to counter the IRA threat, and Canepa requested assistance from London. The commissioner gave assurances that he had been in command of the operation against the IRA at all times, except for the 25 minutes of the military operation. In his cross-examination, McGrory queried the level of control the commissioner had over the operation; he extracted from Canepa that the commissioner had not requested assistance from the SAS specifically. Canepa agreed with &quot;O&quot; that the Spanish police had lost track of the IRA team, and that Savage&#x27;s arrival in Gibraltar took the authorities by surprise. Although a police officer was stationed in an observation post at the border with instructions for alerting other officers to the arrival of the IRA team, Canepa told the inquest that the officer had been looking for the three IRA members arriving at once. He told McGrory he was &quot;unsure&quot; whether or not the officer had the details of the false passports the trio were travelling under.

The officer from the observation post denied knowing the pseudonyms under which the IRA members were travelling. On cross-examination, he acknowledged having been provided with the pseudonyms at a briefing the night before the shootings. Detective Chief Inspector Joseph Ullger, head of the Gibraltar Police Special Branch, told the coroner that the Spanish border guards had let Savage through carelessness, while the regular border officials on the Gibraltar side had not been told to look for the IRA team.

&quot;Soldier F&quot;, a British Army colonel who was in command of the SAS detachment, testified next, followed by &quot;Soldier E&quot;, a more junior officer who was directly responsible for the soldiers. The inquest then heard from the soldiers involved. The SAS personnel all told the coroner that they had been briefed to expect the would-be bombers to be in possession of a remote detonator, and that they had been told that Savage&#x27;s car definitely contained a bomb. Each soldier testified that the IRA team made movements which the soldiers believed to be threatening, and this prompted them to open fire. McGrory asked about the SAS&#x27;s policy on lethal force during cross-examination; he asked &quot;Soldier D&quot; about allegations that Savage was shot while on the ground, something &quot;D&quot; strenuously denied, though he stated that he had intended to continue shooting Savage until he was dead.

Several Gibraltar Police officers gave evidence about the aftermath of the shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers&#x27; shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Other witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.

===Civilian witnesses===
One of the first civilian witnesses was Allen Feraday, the principal scientific officer at the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment. He suggested that a remote detonator could reach from the scenes of the shootings to the car park in which Savage had left the white Renault and beyond. On cross-examination, he stated that the aerial on the Renault was not the type he would expect to be used for receiving a detonation signal and that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a line of sight to their target. The following day, &quot;Soldier G&quot; told the coroner that he was not an explosives expert, and that his assessment of Savage&#x27;s car was based on his belief that the vehicle&#x27;s aerial looked &quot;too new&quot;. McGrory called Dr Michael Scott, an expert in radio-controlled detonation, who disagreed with government witnesses that a bomb at the assembly area could have been detonated from the petrol station, having conducted tests prior to testifying. The government responded by commissioning its own tests, which showed that radio communication between the petrol station and the car park was possible, but not guaranteed.

Alan Watson, a British forensic pathologist, carried out a post-mortem examination of the bodies. Watson arrived in Gibraltar the day after the shootings, by which time the bodies had been taken to the Royal Navy Hospital; he found that the bodies had been stripped of their clothing (causing difficulties in distinguishing entry and exit wounds), that the mortuary had no X-ray machine (which would have allowed Watson to track the paths of the bullets through the bodies), and that he was refused access to any other X-ray machine. After the professor returned to his home in Scotland, he was refused access to the results of blood tests and other evidence which had been sent for analysis and was dissatisfied with the photographs taken by the Gibraltar Police photographer who had assisted him. At the inquest, McGrory questioned the lack of assistance given to the pathologist, which Watson told him was &quot;a puzzle&quot;.

Watson concluded that McCann had been shot four times—once in the jaw (possibly a ricochet), once in the head, and twice in the back; Farrell was shot five times (twice in the face and three times in the back). Watson was unable to determine exactly how many times Savage was shot—he estimated that it was possibly as many as eighteen times. Watson agreed with McGrory&#x27;s characterisation that Savage&#x27;s body was &quot;riddled with bullets&quot;, stating &quot;I concur with your word. Like a frenzied attack&quot;, a statement which made headlines the following morning. Watson suggested that the deceased were shot while on the ground; a second pathologist called by McGrory offered similar findings. Two weeks later, the court heard from David Pryor—a forensic scientist working for London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police—who had analysed the IRA members&#x27; clothes. His analysis was hampered by the condition of the clothing. Pryor offered evidence which contradicted Soldiers &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; about their proximity to McCann and Farrell when they opened fire—the soldiers claimed they were at least six feet (1.8 metres) away, but Pryor&#x27;s analysis was that McCann and Farrell were shot from a distance of no more than two or three feet (0.6 or 0.9 metres).

Several eyewitnesses gave evidence. Three witnessed parts of the shootings and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while they were on the floor. Witnesses from &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; also appeared—Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia&#x27;s testimony had changed since she spoke to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected. The SAS&#x27;s lawyer observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife&#x27;s testimony, he believed that Farrell&#x27;s gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car was driven by Inspector Revagliatte and carrying four uniformed police officers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers&#x27; version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta&#x27;s evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; had been shown.

Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; team through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared. He retracted his statements to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, which he claimed he had made up after &quot;pestering&quot; from Major Bob Randall (another &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; witness, who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British media covered Asquez&#x27;s retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused Asquez of lying for the television (and &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; of encouraging him) in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. Asquez could not explain why his original statement mentioned the Soldiers &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; donning berets, showing identity cards, and telling members of the public &quot;it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s the police&quot; after shooting Savage (details which were not public before the inquest).

===Verdict===
The inquest concluded on 30 September, and Laws and McGrory made their submissions to the coroner regarding the instructions he should give to the jury (Hucker allowed Laws to speak on his behalf). Laws asked the coroner to instruct the jury not to return a verdict of &quot;unlawful killing&quot; on the grounds that there had been a conspiracy to murder the IRA operatives. He allowed for the possibility that the SAS personnel had individually acted unlawfully. McGrory, on the other hand, asked the coroner to allow for the possibility that the British government had conspired to murder McCann, Savage, and Farrell, which he believed was evidenced by the decision to use the SAS for Operation Flavius. The decision, according to McGrory was

When the coroner asked McGrory to clarify whether he believed there had been a conspiracy to murder the IRA operatives, he responded

Pizzarello then summarised the evidence for the jury and instructed them that they could return a verdict of unlawful killing under any of five circumstances, including if they were satisfied that there had been a conspiracy within the British government to murder the three suspected terrorists. He also urged the jury to return a conclusive verdict, rather than the &quot;ambiguity&quot; of an open verdict, and forbade them to make recommendations or add a rider. By a majority of nine to two, they returned a verdict of lawful killing.

Six weeks after the inquest, a Gibraltar Police operations order was leaked. The document listed Inspector Revagliatte as the commander of two police firearms teams assigned to the operation. In February 1989, British journalists discovered that the IRA team operating in Spain must have contained more members than the three killed in Gibraltar. The staff at the agencies from which the team rented their vehicles gave the Spanish police descriptions which did not match McCann, Savage, or Farrell and Savage&#x27;s car was rented several hours before he arrived in Spain.

It emerged that the Spanish authorities knew where McCann and Savage were staying. A senior Spanish police officer repeatedly told journalists that the IRA cell had been under surveillance throughout their time in Spain, and that the Spanish told the British authorities that they did not believe that the three were in possession of a bomb on 6 March. Although the Spanish government did not comment, it honoured 22 police officers involved in the operation at a secret awards ceremony in December 1988, and a Spanish government minister told a press conference in March 1989 that &quot;we followed the terrorists. They were completely under our control&quot;. The same month, a journalist discovered that the Spanish side of the operation was conducted by the Foreign Intelligence Brigade rather than the local police as the British government had suggested. &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot; conjectured as to the reason for the Spanish government&#x27;s silence—in 1988, Spain was attempting to join the Western European Union, but was opposed by Britain; the papers&#x27; theory was that Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government dropped its opposition in exchange for the Spanish government&#x27;s silence.

==Legal proceedings==
In March 1990 the McCann, Savage, and Farrell families began proceedings against the British government at the High Court in London. The case was dismissed on the grounds that Gibraltar was outside the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The families launched an appeal, but withdrew it in the belief that it had no prospect of success. They then applied to the European Commission of Human Rights for an opinion on whether the authorities&#x27; actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 (the &quot;right to life&quot;) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Issuing its report in April 1993, the commission criticised the conduct of the operation, but found that there had been no violation of Article 2. Nevertheless, the commission referred the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for a final decision.

The British government submitted that the killings were &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, within the meaning of Article 2, paragraph 2, to protect the people of Gibraltar from unlawful violence. They stated that the soldiers who carried out the shootings believed that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were capable of detonating a car bomb by remote control. The families alleged that the government had conspired to kill the three; that the planning and control of the operation was flawed; that the inquest was not adequately equipped to investigate the killings; and that the applicable laws of Gibraltar were not compliant with Article 2. The court found that the soldiers&#x27; &quot;reflex action&quot; in resorting to lethal force was excessive, but that the soldiers&#x27; actions did not, in their own right, give rise to a violation of Article 2. The court held that the soldiers&#x27; use of force based on an honestly held belief could be justified, even if that belief was mistaken. To hold otherwise would, in the court&#x27;s opinion, place too great a burden on law-enforcement personnel. It also dismissed all other allegations, except that regarding the planning and control of the operation. In that respect, the court found that the authorities&#x27; failure to arrest the suspects as they crossed the border or earlier, combined with the information that was passed to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. Thus, the court decided there had been a violation of Article 2 in the control of the operation.

As the suspects had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families&#x27; claims for damages, as well as their claim for expenses incurred at the inquest. The court did order the British government to pay the applicants&#x27; costs incurred during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.

==Long-term impact==
A history of the Gibraltar Police described Operation Flavius as &quot;the most controversial and violent event&quot; in the history of the force, while the journalist Nicholas Eckert described the incident as &quot;one of the great controversies of the Troubles&quot; and the academic Richard English posited that the &quot;awful sequence of interwoven deaths&quot; was one of the conflict&#x27;s &quot;most strikingly memorable and shocking periods&quot;. The explosives the IRA intended to use in Gibraltar were believed to have come from Libya, which was known to be supplying arms to the IRA in the 1980s; some sources speculated that Gibraltar was chosen for its relative proximity to Libya, and the targeting of the territory was intended as a gesture of gratitude to Gaddafi.

Several commentators, including Father Raymond Murray, a Catholic priest and author of several books on the Troubles, took the shootings as evidence that the British authorities pursued a &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; policy against the IRA, and that they intentionally used lethal force in preference to arresting suspected IRA members. Maurice Punch, an academic specialising in policing and civil liberties, described the ECtHR verdict as &quot;a landmark case with important implications&quot; for the control of police operations involving firearms. According to Punch, the significance of the ECtHR judgement was that it placed accountability for the failures in the operation with its commanders, rather than with the soldiers who carried out the shooting. Punch believed that the ruling demonstrated that operations intended to arrest suspects should be conducted by civilian police officers, rather than soldiers. The case is considered a landmark in cases concerning Article 2, particularly in upholding the principle that Article 2, paragraph 2, defines circumstances in which it is permissible to use force which may result in a person&#x27;s death as an unintended consequence, rather than circumstances in which it is permissible to intentionally deprive a person of their life. It has been cited in later ECtHR cases concerning the use of lethal force by police.

After the inquest verdict, the Governor of Gibraltar, Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry declared &quot;Even in this remote place, there is no place for terrorists.&quot; In apparent revenge for his role in Operation Flavius, Terry and his wife were shot and seriously injured when the IRA attacked their home in Staffordshire two years later, in September 1990.

Following Asquez&#x27;s retraction of his statement to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed, the IBA contacted Thames Television to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary. Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry (the first such inquiry into an individual programme), to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA; Thames engaged Lord Windlesham and Richard Rampton, QC to conduct the investigation. In their report, published in January 1989, Windlesham and Rampton levelled several criticisms at &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, but found it to be a &quot;trenchant&quot; piece of work made in &quot;good faith and without ulterior motives&quot;. In conclusion, the authors believed that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; proved &quot;freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all the means of mass communication&quot;.

<doc id="422114" wikidata="Q6942028" url="?curid=422114" title="Music of Burkina Faso">
<text>The music of [[Burkina Faso]] includes the folk music of 60 different ethnic groups. The Mossi people, centrally located around the capital, Ouagadougou, account for 40% of the population while, to the south, Gurunsi, Gurma, Dagaaba and Lobi populations, speaking Gur languages closely related to the Mossi language, extend into the coastal states. In the north and east the Fulani of the Sahel preponderate, while in the south and west the Mande languages are common; Samo, Bissa, Bobo, Senufo and Marka. Burkinabé traditional music has continued to thrive and musical output remains quite diverse. Popular music is mostly in French: Burkina Faso has yet to produce a major pan-African success.

==Popular music==

Burkina Faso&#x27;s popular music scene has not yet garnered the fame of that of other West African countries, and many popular recordings are imported from Europe, the United States and Democratic Republic of the Congo. In spite of this influx of popular styles, a few early musical acts achieved success such as Koudbi Koala&#x27;s group Saaba, who perform traditional Mossi music from the region around Ouagadougou, the nation&#x27;s capital. With a musical career that lasted half a century, singer Amadou Balaké was one of the foremost singers from the country during the 20th century. In his music, Balaké combined Mandé, Mossi, and Afro-Cuban traditions. Other influential artists from the country include George Ouédraogo and Joseph Moussa Salambéré &quot;Salambo&quot;.

Popular traditional groups from Burkina Faso include balafon bands, percussion ensembles and others such as Farafina and Gabin Dabiré, who uses elements of traditional Burkinabé music. Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso&#x27;s second-largest city, is a cultural centre of Burkina Faso&#x27;s Mandé people of the southwest. Burkinabe artist Barack La Voix D&#x27;or is a contemporary artist blending traditional Mande styles with modern afrobeat.

More recently, modern musicians in Burkina Faso are beginning to incorporate more foreign influences into their music, especially those from the United States, with genres such as hip-hop, rap, salsa and techno entering the music scene. The zouglou genre from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, along with its originator zouk, are also popular modern genres in Burkina Faso.

Another modern genre that entered Burkina Faso is the Ivorian coupé-décalé, characterised by its electronic dance beat and percussive rhythm. Modern popular artists in Burkina Faso that have utilised this genre include Floby, Dez Altino, Dicko Fils, Imilo Lechanceux, Kayawoto, Huguo Boss, Razben, Barsa 1er, Agozo, Bebeto Bongo, Greg Burkimbila, David Le Combattant and Sofiano.

==Traditional music==
The kora, the stringed instrument of the &quot;djeli&quot;, has been popular throughout much of West Africa since the Malian empire of the 1240s. The instrument traditionally featured seven strings until the Gambian griot Madi Woulendi increased that number to twenty-one. The kora can be played in several scales including the hypolydian mode (&quot;saouta&quot;), silaba, sim&#x27;bi and mandéka.

Mande-speakers are also known for the balafon, a kind of wooden xylophone, the exact characteristics of which can vary depending on the maker. The Dagara, Bwa and Senufo peoples also have their own varieties.

Djembe drums, like balafons, are often manufactured in Bobo Dioulasso. The djembe, a vital part of Burkinabé traditional music, is said to be of Malinké origin. It is made from a single piece of wood, usually from a caïlcedrat or lenke tree.

The bendré drum (called &quot;bara&quot; in Mali and &quot;dumaa&quot; among the Hausa) is a membranophone made from a gourd with the top cut off and covered with goat or sheep skin. It is an ancient instrument, probably introduced during the reign of Naaba Oubri to be played in sacred music at the royal courts of Moaga by a head drummer (&quot;benaaba&quot;) who strikes the center or edges of the drum to make varying sounds.

Another stringed instrument is called the n&#x27;goni. Legend says it was invented by a Senufo hunter. The n&#x27;goni is also played in Niger, Senegal and Mali.

The Fula people &quot;(Fulbe)&quot; of the north play a variety of traditional instruments including drums, &quot;hoddu&quot; (or &quot;xalam&quot;, a plucked skin-covered lute related to the banjo) and the &quot;riti&quot; or &quot;riiti&quot; (a one-string bowed instrument), and use complex vocal techniques with clapping percussion. Their griots are known as &quot;gawlo&quot;.

<doc id="422115" wikidata="Q288601" url="?curid=422115" title="Operation Frankton">
<text>Operation Frankton was a commando raid on ships in the German occupied French port of Bordeaux in southwest France during World War II. The raid was carried out by a small unit of Royal Marines known as the Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment (RMBPD), part of Combined Operations, inserted by captained by Lieutenant-Commander Dick Raikes who, earlier, had been awarded the DSO for operations while in command of the submarine .
(The RMBPD would later form the Special Boat Service.)

The plan was for six folding kayaks to be taken to the area of the Gironde estuary by submarine. Twelve men would then paddle by night to Bordeaux. On arrival they would attack the docked cargo ships with limpet mines and then escape overland to Spain. Men from no.1 section were selected for the raid; including the commanding officer, Herbert &quot;Blondie&quot; Hasler, and with the reserve marine Colley the team numbered thirteen in total. One kayak was damaged while being deployed from the submarine, and it and its crew therefore could not take part in the mission. Only two of the ten men who launched from the submarine survived the raid: Hasler, and his number two in the kayak, Bill Sparks. Of the other eight, six were executed by the Germans and two died from hypothermia. Two German vessels were sunk with another four suffering varying degrees of damage.

==Background==
The Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment (RMBPD) was formed on 6 July 1942, and based at Southsea, Portsmouth. The RMBPD was under the command of Royal Marines Major Herbert &quot;Blondie&quot; Hasler with Captain J. D. Stewart as second in command. The detachment consisted of 34 men and was based at Lumps Fort, and often exercised in the Portsmouth Harbour and patrolled the harbour boom at night. On 13 August 1942, Hasler and Stewart visited HMS &quot;Tormentor&quot; to attend a demonstration of fast motorboat training, in preparation for the operation.

The Bay of Biscay port of Bordeaux was a major destination for goods to support the German war effort. In the 12 months from June 1941 to 1942 vegetable and animal oils, other raw materials, and 25,000 tons of crude rubber had arrived at the port. Hasler submitted a plan of attack on 21 September 1942. The initial plan called for a force of three kayaks to be transported to the Gironde estuary by submarine then paddle by night and hide by day until they reached Bordeaux from the sea, thus hoping to avoid the 32 mixed Kriegsmarine ships that patrolled or used the port. On arrival they hoped to sink between six and 12 cargo ships then escape overland to Spain.

Permission for the raid was granted on 13 October 1942, but Admiral Louis Mountbatten, chief of combined operations, increased the number of kayaks to be taken to six. Mountbatten had originally ordered that Hasler could not take part in the raid, because of his experience as the chief kayaking specialist, but changed his mind after Hasler (the only man with experience in small boats) formally submitted his reasons for inclusion. The RMBPD started training for the raid on 20 October 1942, which included kayak handling, submarine rehearsals, limpet mine handling and escape and evasion exercises. The RMBPD practised for the raid with a simulated attack against Deptford, starting from Margate and kayaking up the Swale.

Mark II kayaks, which were given the codename of &quot;Cockle&quot;, were selected for the raid. The Mark II was a semi rigid two-man kayak, with the sides made of canvas, a flat bottom and long. When collapsed it had to be capable of negotiating the narrow confines of the submarine to the storage area, and then, before it was ready to be taken on deck, erected and stored ready to be hauled out via the submarine torpedo hatch. During the raid each kayak&#x27;s load would be two men, eight limpet mines, three sets of paddles, a compass, a depth sounding reel, repair bag, torch, camouflage net, waterproof watch, fishing line, two hand grenades, rations and water for six days, a spanner to activate the mines and a magnet to hold the kayak against the side of cargo ships. The total safe load for the &quot;Cockle&quot; Mark 2 was . The men also carried .45 1911 Colt semi-automatic pistols and Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knives.

The men selected to go on the raid were divided into two divisions, each having their own targets.
* A Division
:: Hasler and Marine Bill Sparks in kayak &quot;Catfish&quot;
:: Corporal Albert Laver and Marine William Mills in kayak &quot;Crayfish&quot;
:: Corporal George Sheard and Marine David Moffatt in kayak &quot;Conger&quot;
* B Division
:: Lieutenant John Mackinnon and Marine James Conway in kayak &quot;Cuttlefish&quot;
:: Sergeant Samuel Wallace and Marine Robert Ewart in kayak &quot;Coalfish&quot;
:: Marine W. A. Ellery and Marine E. Fisher in kayak &quot;Cachalot&quot;

A thirteenth man was taken as a reserve, Marine Norman Colley.

==Mission==
===Approach===
On 30 November 1942 under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Dick Raikes DSO the Royal Navy submarine sailed from Holy Loch in Scotland with the six kayaks and raiders on board. The submarine was supposed to reach the Gironde estuary and the mission was scheduled to start on 6 December 1942. This was delayed because of bad weather en route and the need to negotiate a minefield. By 7 December 1942 the submarine had reached the Gironde estuary and surfaced some from the mouth of the estuary. &quot;Cachalot&quot;s hull was damaged while being passed out of the submarine hatch, leaving just five kayaks to start the raid. The reserve member of the team, Colley, was not needed, so he remained aboard the submarine with the &quot;Cachalot&quot; crew Ellery and Fisher.

According to &quot;Tuna&#x27;s&quot; log, the five remaining kayaks were disembarked at 19:30 hours on 7 December. However sources differ on the start time between 19:36 and 20:22. The plan was for the crews to paddle, resting for five minutes in every hour. The first night, 7/8 December, fighting against strong cross tides and cross winds, &quot;Coalfish&quot; had disappeared. Further on the surviving crews encountered high waves and &quot;Conger&quot; capsized and was scuttled, once it became apparent that it would not be possible to bail it out. The crew consisting of Sheard and Moffatt held on to two of the remaining kayaks, which carried them as close to the shore as possible, and they then had to swim for it. The three kayaks met the missing &quot;Coalfish&quot; shortly afterwards and continued.

Carrying on with the raid, the four remaining kayaks approached a checkpoint in the river and came upon three German frigates. Lying flat on the kayaks and paddling silently they managed to get by without being discovered but Mackinnon and Conway in &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; became separated from the other kayaks in the group. After reaching the shore, MacKinnon and Conway evaded capture for four days, but were betrayed and arrested by the Gendarmerie and handed over to the Germans at La Reole hospital southeast of Bordeaux, while attempting to make their way to the Spanish border.

On the first night the three remaining kayaks, &quot;Catfish&quot;, &quot;Crayfish&quot; and &quot;Coalfish&quot;, covered in five hours and landed near St Vivien du Medoc. While they were hiding during the day and unknown to the others, Wallace and Ewart in &quot;Coalfish&quot; had been captured at daybreak near the Pointe de Grave lighthouse where they had come ashore.

By the end of the second night, 8/9 December, the two remaining kayaks &quot;Catfish&quot; and &quot;Crayfish&quot; had paddled a further in six hours. The third night, 9/10 December, they paddled and on the fourth night, 10/11 December, because of the strong ebb tide they only managed to cover . The original plan had called for the raid to be carried out on 10 December, but Hasler now changed the plan. Because of the strength of the ebb tide they still had a short distance to paddle, so Hasler ordered they hide for another day and set off to and reach Bordeaux on the night of 11/12 December. After a night&#x27;s rest, the men spent the day preparing their equipment and limpet mines which were set to detonate at 21:00 hours. Hasler decided that &quot;Catfish&quot; would cover the western side of the docks and &quot;Crayfish&quot; the eastern side.

===Bordeaux===
&quot;Catfish&quot; and &quot;Crayfish&quot; reached Bordeaux on the fifth night, 11/12 December; the river was flat calm and there was a clear sky. The attack started at 21:00 hours on 11 December, Hasler and Sparks in &quot;Catfish&quot; attacking shipping on the western side of the dock, placed eight limpet mines on four vessels including a &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; patrol boat. A sentry on the deck of the &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot;, apparently spotting something, shone his torch down toward the water, but the camouflaged kayak evaded detection in the darkness. They had planted all their mines and left the harbour with the ebb tide at 00:45 hours. At the same time Laver and Mills in &quot;Crayfish&quot; had reached the eastern side of the dock without finding any targets, so returned to deal with the ships docked at Bassens. They placed eight limpet mines on two vessels, five on a large cargo ship and three on a small liner.

On their way downriver the two kayaks met by chance on the île Cazeau. They continued down river together until 06:00 hours when they beached their kayaks near St Genes de Blaye and tried to hide them by sinking them. The two crews then set out separately, on foot, for the Spanish border. After two days Laver and Mills were apprehended at Montlieu-la-Garde by the Gendarmerie and handed over to the Germans.

On 10 December, the Germans announced that a sabotage squad had been caught on 8 December near the mouth of the Gironde and &quot;finished off in combat&quot;. It was not until January 1943 in the absence of other information that all 10 men on the raid were posted missing, until news arrived of two of them. Later it was confirmed that five ships had been damaged in Bordeaux by mysterious explosions. New research in 2010 revealed that a sixth ship had been damaged even more extensively than any of the other five reported, which were quickly repaired and put back into service.

In his pre-operation briefing, Hasler was told that after the operation he and other members of the group should make their way to the French town of Ruffec, from where they had beached their kayak, and find someone there from the French Resistance. He and Sparks arrived in Ruffec on 18 December 1942. They made contact with escape line leader Mary Lindell and her son, Maurice, at the Hotel de la Toque Blanche and were taken to a local farm. They spent the next 18 days there in hiding. Lindell arranged for them to be guided on foot across the Pyrenees into Spain and safety.

==Aftermath==
Six ships were damaged, four of them severely. The German blockade runner &quot;Tannenfels&quot; listed heavily and soon sank. The rear of the freighter &quot;Dresden&quot;, whose superstructure and propeller shaft had been severed, sank to the bottom. The cargo ship &quot;Alabama&quot; was holed by the five limpets and was also severely damaged. The cargo ship &quot;Portland&quot; was also holed and a fire caused severe internal damage. Subsequently, the &quot;Tannenfels&quot; which was no longer considered sea worthy, was scuttled and used as a blockship in the Gironde. The &quot;Alabama&quot; and the &quot;Portland&quot; with the help of divers, were raised and put in dry dock to undergo repairs which took several months. It is not known precisely what happened to the Sperrbrecher and the tanker &quot;Python&quot; but it was possible the limpets may have either fallen off and exploded in the water. Nevertheless, for several hours after the first explosion there was chaos and confusion at the two ports, Bassen and Bordeaux.

It was not until 23 February 1943 that Combined Operations Headquarters heard via a secret message sent by Mary Lindell to the War Office that Hasler and Sparks were safe. On 2 April 1943 Hasler arrived back in Britain by air from Gibraltar, having passed through the French Resistance escape organisation. Sparks was sent back by sea and arrived much later.

For their part in the raid Hasler was awarded a Distinguished Service Order and Sparks the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM). Laver and Mills were also recommended for the DSM which at the time could not be awarded posthumously, so instead they were mentioned in dispatches.

Wallace and Ewart revealed only certain information during their interrogation, and were executed under the Commando Order, on the night of 11 December, in a sandpit in a wood north of Bordeaux, and not at Chateau Magnol, Blanquefort, as is sometimes claimed. A plaque has been erected on the bullet-marked wall at the Chateau, but the authenticity of the details on the plaque has been questioned; indeed given the evidence of a statement by a German officer who was at the execution it is certain that the chateau has no link with Wallace and Ewart. A small memorial can also be seen at the Pointe de Grave, where they were captured. In March 2011 a €100,000 memorial was unveiled at this same spot. After the Royal Marines were executed by a naval firing squad, the Commander of the Navy Admiral Erich Raeder wrote in the &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; war diary that the executions of the captured Royal Marines were something &quot;new in international law, since the soldiers were wearing uniforms&quot;. The American historian Charles Thomas wrote that Raeder&#x27;s remarks about the executions in the &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; war diary seemed to be some sort of ironic comment, which might have reflected a bad conscience on Raeder&#x27;s part.

Mackinnon had been admitted to the hospital for treatment for an infected knee. Evidence shows that Laver, Mills, Mackinnon and Conway were not executed in Paris in 1942 but possibly in the same location as Wallace and Ewart under the Commando Order. The exact date of their execution is not known.

Sheard and Moffatt from the capsized &quot;Conger&quot; were not drowned on the first night but died of hypothermia. The body of Moffatt was found on the Île de Ré on 14 December but Sheard&#x27;s body is believed to have been recovered and buried elsewhere further up the coastline. Sheard is remembered on the Hero&#x27;s Stone at his place of birth, North Corner, Devonport.

===Memorials===
The words of Lord Mountbatten, the commander of Combined Operations, are carved into a Purbeck stone at Royal Marines Poole (current headquarters of the SBS): &quot;Of the many brave and dashing raids carried out by the men of Combined Operations Command none was more courageous or imaginative than Operation Frankton&quot;.

Mackinnon is commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial. The bravery of the &#x27;Cockleshell Hero&#x27; Royal Marine James Conway was honoured with a permanent memorial unveiled on Sunday 10 December 2017 in his home town of Stockport. There is a commemorating the 70th anniversary of the operation in Birkenhead, the home of Corporal Albert Laver.

Laver, Sheard, Mills, Conway, Wallace, Moffatt, and Ewart are commemorated on the Plymouth Naval Memorial.

In June 2002, the &quot;Frankton Trail&quot; was opened, a walking path which traces the route taken through occupied France, on foot, by Hasler and Sparks. The &quot;Frankton Souvenir&quot; is an Anglo-French organisation, set up to keep alive the story of the raid. It plans to develop the trail, and install explanatory plaques at points.

On 31 March 2011 a memorial to the Cockleshell Heroes and three French individuals was dedicated. Made from Portland stone it was transported across care of Brittany Ferries. The memorial cost about .

The only known surviving Cockle Mark II kayak from Operation Frankton, &quot;Cachalot&quot;, together with other original equipment, can be seen at the Combined Military Services Museum, located in Maldon, Essex.

In France, the memory of the heroes of Operation Frankton is commemorated every year, notably in Bordeaux, Blanquefort, Saint-Georges-de-Didonne and Ruffec.

Commemorative plaques have been placed in the Entre-deux-Mers region in Baigneaux and Cessac. Unfortunately, the one in Cessac, located on the edge of a bicycle path, in view of the Jaubert farmhouse, has been vandalized. In 2011, as part of a project to move the monument to the dead of the 1914–1918 war, the municipality proposes to place a second plaque against the wall of the town hall, at the new location of the commemorations. A monument is also present on the town of Montalivet-les-Bains, facing the sea.

A tramway station on line C of the TBM network, located in the town of Blanquefort, is named Frankton.

===Depictions===
A heavily fictionalised version of the event was depicted in the 1955 film &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot; made by Warwick Films, and starring Anthony Newley, Trevor Howard, Christopher Lee, Victor Maddern, David Lodge and Jose Ferrer, who was also the director. The film was a box office hit in 1956 and was quickly followed by the publication of Brigadier C. E. Lucas Phillips&#x27; book of the same name. &quot;Blondie&quot; Hasler had connections with both the film and the book. He hated the title of both and walked away from his role as technical adviser for the former to try and set the matter right in the latter.

On 1 November 2011, a BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; television documentary called &quot;The Most Courageous Raid of WWII&quot; was narrated by Paddy Ashdown, a former SBS officer. Ashdown describes Frankton as &quot;a Whitehall cock-up of major proportions&quot; due to a simultaneous mission to sink the ships in Bordeaux, led by Claude de Baissac of the Special Operations Executive, which Hasler&#x27;s team and Combined Operations knew nothing about because of the secrecy and lack of co-operation among British government agencies. De Baissac was preparing to take explosives onto the ships when he heard the explosions of Hasler&#x27;s limpet mines. The loss of the opportunity for Hasler and de Baissac to work together to strike a harder blow against the Germans in a combined operation led to the setting up of a Controlling Officer at Whitehall, responsible for avoiding inter-departmental rivalry, duplication or even conflict.

In December 2022, ten former Royal Marines recreated the route of Operation Frankton in the &quot;Cockleshell 22&quot; project, to support charities Royal British Legion, the Royal Marines Charity, and Help for Heroes. They paddled over 70 miles in folding kayaks along the Gironde estuary to Bordeaux, where they took part in joint French-British commemoration events. They then made a 100-mile speed march from Blaye to Ruffec, the escape route followed by Major Hasler and Corporal Sparks.

<text>During World War II, Operation Gaff was the parachuting of a six-man patrol of Special Air Service commandos into German-occupied France on Tuesday 25 July 1944, with the aim of killing or kidnapping German field marshal Erwin Rommel.
From March 1943, Allied Intelligence had been undertaking research on the whereabouts, bases and travel arrangements of Field Marshal Rommel. Part of the research asked the question of how feasible it would be to kill Rommel. After D-Day, the Allies were meeting fierce resistance, marshalled by Marshal Rommel, with Hitler&#x27;s orders to stand firm at all costs. With losses mounting, Field Marshal Montgomery agreed to a plan to remove Rommel from the battle plan.

After SAS lieutenant-colonel William Fraser was told the location of Rommel&#x27;s headquarters, a chateau home of the Dukes de La Rochefoucauld in the village of La Roche-Guyon, Brigadier R.W. McLeod assigned six specially trained assassins led by French SAS captain Jack William Raymond Lee.

The original Op order, dated 20 July 1944 states:

&quot;To kill ROMMEL would obviously be easier than to kidnap him and it is preferable to ensure the former rather than to attempt and fail in the latter. Kidnapping would require successful two-way W/T communication and therefore a larger party, while killing could be reported by pigeon&quot;
On Tuesday 25 July 1944, Lee and his team parachuted into Orléans. On Friday 28 July 1944 the party found that Rommel had been severely injured, stating in the post-action report - &quot;&#x27;learned Rommel had been got.&quot;&#x27; Rommel&#x27;s staff car had been overturned in an attack by RAF Hawker Typhoons on 17 July 1944 and he had been replaced by Günther von Kluge. With their plan redundant, they moved toward advancing US Army lines on foot, while ambushing trains and attacking German units along their route, including a German headquarters in Mantes. They reached US forces and safety on 12 August.

<text>Joseph Anthony Mantegna (, ; born November 13, 1947) is an American actor. He has starred in the CBS television series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; since 2007 as FBI Supervisory Special Agent David Rossi. He has voiced the recurring role of mob boss Fat Tony on the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, beginning with the 1991 episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;, as well as &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007).

Mantegna began his career on stage in 1969 in the Chicago production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. He earned a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play and a Joseph Jefferson Award for portraying Richard Roma in the first American productions of David Mamet&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;, the first of many collaborations with Mamet. His long-standing association with Mamet includes the premieres of &quot;A Life in the Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Disappearance of the Jews&quot; and &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot; on Broadway. Mantegna also directed a highly lauded production of Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Lakeboat&quot;, which enjoyed a successful theatrical run in Los Angeles. He later directed the film version of &quot;Lakeboat&quot;. In addition to theatrical appearances directed by Mamet, Mantegna appeared in Mamet&#x27;s films &quot;House of Games&quot; (1987), &quot;Things Change&quot; (1988), &quot;Homicide&quot; (1991), and &quot;Redbelt&quot; (2008).

In film and on television, Mantegna is best known for his roles in box office hits such as &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986), &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990), &quot;Forget Paris&quot; (1995), and &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot; (1996). He starred in the television series &quot;First Monday&quot; (2002) and &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2003–2005). He has earned Emmy Award nominations for his roles in three different miniseries: &quot;The Last Don&quot; (1997), &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Starter Wife&quot; (2007). He has also served as executive producer for various movies and television movies, including &quot;Corduroy&quot; (1984), &quot;Hoods&quot; (1998), and &quot;Lakeboat&quot; (2000), which he also directed. Additionally, he played Robert B. Parker&#x27;s fictional detective Spenser in three made-for-TV movies between 1999 and 2001, and has narrated a number of audiobook readings of the Spenser novels.

==Early life and education==
Mantegna was born on November 13, 1947, in Chicago, to Italian American parents. His parents were Mary Ann (Novelli; 1916–2017), a shipping clerk from Acquaviva delle Fonti, Apulia, Italy, and Joseph Henry Mantegna (1913–1971), an insurance salesman from Calascibetta, Sicily, who died in 1971 of tuberculosis.

Mantegna was raised Catholic and attended J. Sterling Morton High School East in Cicero, Illinois. He then attended Morton College and the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University), leaving just before graduation in 1969.

As a young man in Chicago, he played bass in a band called The Apocryphals, which later played with another local group, The Missing Links, who went on to form the band Chicago. As of 2007, Mantegna remained very close to the original members of Chicago.

Mantegna started off in the film industry as a photographer, taking headshots.

==Career==

Mantegna made his acting debut in the Chicago production of the stage musical &quot;Hair&quot; (1969) and debuted on Broadway in &quot;Working&quot; (1978). He co-wrote &quot;Bleacher Bums&quot;, an award-winning play which was first performed at Chicago&#x27;s Organic Theater Company, and was a member of its original cast. In the movie &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1980), he had a small role which was cut, although since his name is in the film&#x27;s credits, Mantegna gets residuals for the film.

Mantegna won a Tony award for his portrayal of Richard Roma in David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. He has had a long and successful association with Mamet, appearing in a number of his works.

Mantegna made his feature film debut in &quot;Medusa Challenger&quot; (1977). He played womanizing dentist Bruce Fleckstein in &quot;Compromising Positions&quot; (1985). He starred in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in 1985 called Shelter Skelter. His other early film roles were supporting performances in &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986), &quot;Weeds&quot; (1987) and &quot;Suspect&quot; (1987).

He also starred in the critically acclaimed movies &quot;House of Games&quot; (1987) and &quot;Things Change&quot; (1988), both written by Mamet. He and &quot;Things Change&quot; co-star Don Ameche received the Best Actor Award at the Venice Film Festival. In 1991, Mantegna starred in another Mamet story, the highly praised police thriller &quot;Homicide.&quot;

Mantegna has played a wide range of roles, from the comic, as a jaded disc jockey in &quot;Airheads&quot; and an inept kidnapper from &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, to the dramatic, in roles such as Joey Zasa, a treacherous mobster in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990) and an Emmy-nominated performance as singer Dean Martin in HBO&#x27;s film &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; (1998).

Mantegna has a recurring role in the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the voice of mob boss Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; D&#x27;Amico. He insists on voicing the character every time he appears, no matter how little dialogue he has. To quote Mantegna: &quot;If Fat Tony sneezes, I want to be there.&quot; However, in one instance, Phil Hartman voiced Fat Tony in the episode &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;.

Mantegna spoofed himself when he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the 1990–1991 season in which he calmly began his monologue by saying he did not wish to be typecast from his gangster roles. A disappointed little boy and his father leave, as they mistakenly believed the host would be Joe Montana (the football player) due to the similar names. Mantegna then began speaking in a low, controlled voice to the little boy, telling him it was best to stay in the audience and respect his performance; he warned the boy that if he (Mantegna) made a call, then Montana would not play in his next game—an implication that Mantegna&#x27;s true personality equaled his gangster roles.

In 2002, Mantegna starred as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Justice Joseph Novelli, on the CBS midseason replacement drama &quot;First Monday&quot;.

Mantegna received the Lifetime Achievement Award on April 26, 2004, at the Los Angeles Italian Film Festival.

On August 11, 2007, Mantegna signed on to replace departing star Mandy Patinkin on the CBS crime drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. Starting with season 9, he also directed several episodes.

Mantegna is very close with all his co-stars on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; but is especially close with Shemar Moore. He is said to act like a father figure for Moore.

Since 2006, he has co-narrated the National Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington D.C., with Gary Sinise.

In 2016, he took part in an event at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art reading some of Gabriele Tinti&#x27;s poems about Hercules.

Mantegna is said to have helped Verne Troyer get into the industry and presented him with the Media Access Award before his death.

==Legacy==
On April 29, 2011, Mantegna received the 2,438th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. On June 6, 2011, Mantegna&#x27;s hometown of Cicero, Illinois celebrated his body of work with an honorary street sign—Joe Mantegna Boulevard—on the northeast corner of Austin Boulevard and 25th Street, the location of his high school. In 2014, Mantegna received a star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto. On May 3, 2017, the city of Chicago dedicated Joe Mantegna Way, a section of Armitage Avenue where Mantegna lived during his early acting days.

On April 4, 2015, Mantegna received a Lifetime Achievement Award for Film and Television from The Riverside International Film Festival. On May 22, 2015, Mantegna received the Saint Pio Award from the Saint Pio Foundation, in recognition of his outstanding contribution in being an extraordinary individual in &quot;providing relief from suffering to those in need&quot;.

An avid firearms enthusiast, he is the host of MidwayUSA&#x27;s &quot;Gun Stories&quot; on the cable television Outdoor Channel.

==Personal life==
Mantegna married Arlene Vrhel on October 3, 1975. He said in an interview on &quot;The Talk&quot; that the 300th episode of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; aired on October 3, 2018, their 43rd wedding anniversary, and he apologized during that interview for working on their anniversary.

They have two daughters: Mia and Gia. Arlene owned a Chicago-themed restaurant in Burbank, California, named Taste Chicago, which closed on March 22, 2019, for personal reasons. Mia, born 1987, is autistic and works as a make-up artist. She has also appeared with her father on KCAL-TV in support of Autism Awareness Month (April). Gia was born Gina in 1990 and changed her name at age eighteen.

Mantegna is a Chicago Cubs fan and has led the singing of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the 7th inning stretch multiple times. This was referenced in the show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; where his character David Rossi&#x27;s office is decked with Cubs gear.

In 1988, during the play &quot;Speed the Plow&quot;, Mantegna was stricken with Bell&#x27;s palsy. Although considered temporary, Mantegna still has persistent facial characteristics of the disease.

<text>George Wildman Ball (December 21, 1909 – May 26, 1994) was an American diplomat and banker. He served in the management of the US State Department from 1961 to 1966 and is remembered by most as the only cabinet member of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson who was a major dissenter against the escalation of the Vietnam War. Ball advised against deploying U.S. combat forces, as he believed it would lead the United States into an unwinnable war and result in a prolonged conflict. Instead, he argued that the United States should prioritize allocating its resources to Europe rather than engaging in expensive military ventures. However, he refused to publicize his doubts.

He helped determine American policy regarding trade expansion, Congo, the Multilateral Force, de Gaulle&#x27;s France, Israel and the rest of the Middle East, and the Iranian Revolution.

==Early life and education==
Ball was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He lived in Evanston, Illinois, and graduated from Evanston Township High School and Northwestern University with a Bachelor of Science (BS) and a Juris Doctor (JD). Ball joined a Chicago law firm in which Adlai Stevenson II was one of the partners, and became a protégé of Stevenson.

==Early career==
During 1942, he became an official of the Lend Lease program. During 1944 and 1945, he was director of the Strategic Bombing Survey in London.

During 1945, Ball began collaboration with Jean Monnet and the French government in its economic recovery in its negotiations regarding the Marshall Plan. In 1946, Ball co-founded the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, along with Henry J. Friendly, later the chief judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. During 1950 he helped draft the Schuman Plan and the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.

Ball had a major role in Stevenson&#x27;s presidential campaign during 1952. He was the liaison between Stevenson and President Truman and helped publicize Stevenson&#x27;s opinions in major magazine articles. He was also the executive director of the Volunteers For Stevenson, concerned mainly with enlisting independent and Republican voters. He was also a speechwriter in the Stevenson campaign. Ball likewise had a major role in Stevenson&#x27;s 1956 presidential campaign and unsuccessful 1960 bid to gain the Democratic nomination.

==State Department==
Ball was the Under Secretary of State for the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He is known for his opposition to escalation of the Vietnam War. 

After Kennedy decided to send 16,000 &quot;trainers&quot; to Vietnam, Ball, the one dissenter in Kennedy’s entourage, pleaded with JFK to recall France’s devastating defeat in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu and throughout Indochina. Ball raised the question with President Kennedy. (November 7, 1961) &quot;Within five years we&#x27;ll have 300,000 men in the paddies and jungles and never find them again. That was the French experience. Vietnam is the worst possible terrain both from a physical and political point of view.&quot; In response to this prediction, the President seemed unwilling to discuss the matter, responding with an overtone of asperity: &quot;George, you&#x27;re just crazier than hell. That just isn&#x27;t going happen.&quot; As Ball later wrote, Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;statement could be interpreted in two ways: either he was convinced that events would so evolve as not to require escalation, or he was determined not to permit such escalation to occur.&quot;

Ball was one of the endorsers of the 1963 coup which resulted in the death of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother.
As President Johnson was urged by his closest foreign policy and defense advisors to initiate a sustained bombing campaign against North Vietnam during the winter of 1964–1965, Ball forcefully warned Johnson against such an action. In a February 24, 1965, memorandum he passed to the President through his aide Bill Moyers, Ball provided an accurate analysis of the situation in South Vietnam, and of the U.S. stake in it, as well as a startlingly prescient description of the disaster any escalation of American involvement would entail. Urging Johnson to re-examine all the assumptions inherent in the arguments for increasing U.S. involvement, Ball stood alone among the upper echelons of Johnson&#x27;s policymakers when he attacked the prevailing notion, virtually unquestioned at the time in Washington, that America&#x27;s fundamental strategic interest in escalating the conflict was in protecting U.S. international prestige and the reliability of its commitments to allies.

He observed that other international actors, including both allies and enemies, were concerned not whether the U.S. could live up to its promise but rather whether the U.S. could avert a disaster in time instead of squandering strategic capital in a struggle to assist a failed regime. If the U.S. continued in its course, Ball argued, U.S. loyalty would be less questioned than U.S. strategic judgement would. Although Johnson considered the memorandum seriously, Ball had waited too long to deliver it. The decision had already been made, and sustained U.S. bombing operations against North Vietnam commenced on March 2, 1965.
Ball also served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from June 26 to September 25, 1968. During August 1968 at the UN Security Council, he endorsed the Czechoslovaks&#x27; struggle against the Soviet invasion and their right to live without dictatorship.

During the Nixon administration, Ball helped draft American policy proposals on the Persian Gulf.

==Arguments==

Ball was long a critic of Israeli policies toward its Arab neighbors. He &quot;called for the recalibration of America’s Israel policy in a much noted &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; essay&quot; during 1977 and, during 1992, co-authored &quot;The Passionate Attachment&quot; with his son, Douglas Ball. The book argued that American aid to Israel has been morally, politically and financially costly, and described the weaponization of antisemitism for political purposes. Elsewhere in the book, referring to the Israeli attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;, Ball asserted, &quot;... the ultimate lesson of the &quot;Liberty&quot; attack had far more effect on policy in Israel than in America. Israel&#x27;s leaders concluded that nothing they might do would offend the Americans to the point of reprisal. If America&#x27;s leaders did not have the courage to punish Israel for the blatant murder of American citizens, it seemed clear that their American friends would let them get away with almost anything.&quot;

He often used the aphorism (perhaps originally invented by Ian Fleming in the novel &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;) &quot;Nothing propinks like ,&quot; later dubbed the Ball Rule of Power. It means that the more direct access one has to the president, the greater one&#x27;s power regardless of title.

Ball was an advocate of free trade, multinational corporations and their theoretical ability to neutralize what he considered to be &quot;obsolete&quot; nation states. Until and after his ambassadorship, Ball was employed by the banking company Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. He was a senior managing director at Lehman Brothers until his retirement during 1982. Ball was among the first North American members of the Bilderberg Group, attending every meeting except for one before his death. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the group.

==Death==
Ball died in New York City on May 26, 1994. He was buried in Princeton Cemetery.

==Popular culture==
George Ball was portrayed by John Randolph in the 1974 made-for-TV movie &quot;The Missiles of October&quot;, by James Karen in the 2000 movie &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; and by Bruce McGill in the 2002 TV movie &quot;Path to War&quot;.

<text>Operation Gauntlet was an Allied Combined Operation from 25 August until 3 September 1941, during the Second World War. Canadian, British and the Norwegian armed forces in exile (, Outside Front) landed on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen in the Svalbard Archipelago, south of the North Pole.

Coal mines on the islands were owned and operated by Norway at Longyearbyen and by the Soviet Union at Barentsburg; both governments agreed to their destruction and the evacuation of their nationals. The objective of Gauntlet was to deny Germany the coal, mining and shipping infrastructure, equipment and stores on Spitzbergen and suppress the wireless stations on the archipelago, to prevent the Germans receiving weather reports.

Gauntlet was a success; the Germans were ignorant of the expedition until after it had departed, the raiders suffered no casualties, the civilians were repatriated, coal dumps were set on fire and mining equipment destroyed, several ships were taken as prizes and a German warship was sunk on the return journey.

==Background==

===Svalbard Archipelago===
The Svalbard Archipelago lies in the Arctic Ocean about halfway [] between northern Norway and the North Pole. The islands are mountainous, their peaks permanently covered with snow and some are glaciated. There are occasional river terraces at the bottom of steep valleys and some coastal plain. In winter, snow covers the islands and the bays ice over. The main island, Spitzbergen, to the west, has several large fiords along its west coast; Isfjorden is up to wide. The Gulf Stream warms the waters, making the sea ice-free during the summer. There are settlements at Longyearbyen and Barentsburg (inlets along the south shore of Isfjorden), in Kongsfjorden (Kings Bay), north of Isfjorden up the coast and in Van Mijenfjorden to the south. The settlements had attracted colonists from several countries and the Svalbard Treaty of 1920 neutralized the islands and recognised the mineral and fishing rights of the participating countries. Before 1939, the population consisted of about 3,000 people, mostly Norwegians and Russians, who worked in the mining industry. Drift mines were linked to the shore by overhead cable tracks or rails and coal dumped over the winter was collected after the summer thaw. By 1939 production was about a year, roughly evenly divided between Norway and the Soviet Union. A long ton weighs 2,240 lb; a [metric] tonne 2,205 lb.

===Naval operations===

From 25 July to 9 August 1940, the sailed from Trondheim to search the area from Tromsø to Bear Island and Svalbard (formerly Spitzbergen) and intercept British ships returning from Petsamo but found only a Finnish freighter. Action to deny Germany its coal exports was mooted by the British War Cabinet and the Admiralty soon after the German occupation of Norway in 1940. It was also desirable that wireless stations on the islands, which supplied un-coded weather reports which were useful for German military operations, be suppressed. After Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, German occupation of the islands could threaten the Arctic convoy route to North Russia. On 12 July 1941, the Admiralty was ordered to assemble a force of ships to operate in the Arctic, in co-operation with the USSR, despite objections from Admiral John (Jack) Tovey, commander of the Home Fleet, who preferred to operate farther south, where there were more targets and better air cover.

Rear-Admirals Philip Vian and Geoffrey Miles flew to Polyarnoe in northern Russia and Miles established the British military mission in Moscow. Vian reported that Murmansk was too close to German-held territory, that its air defences were inadequate and that the prospects of offensive operations on German shipping were poor. Vian was then sent to reconnoitre the west coast of Spitzbergen, the main island of the Svalbard Archipelago, which was mostly ice-free and from northern Norway, to assess its potential as a base. The cruisers , and two destroyers departed Iceland on 27 July, but Vian found that the advantages of a base at Spitzbergen were negated by the obstacles of weather and proximity to German bases in Norway. The force closed on the Norwegian coast twice and each time was discovered by reconnaissance aircraft and retired.

==Prelude==

===Allied preparations===
On 26 July 1941, the Canadian Corps in Britain offered to provide sufficient troops for a landing on Spitzbergen, to garrison a naval refuelling base for four months and then withdraw before winter. Force 111 was to be raised, comprising two battalions of a Canadian infantry brigade, less transport and attached units including an anti-aircraft battery. The Canadians offered the HQ of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Arthur Potts) and its signal section, the 3rd Field Company Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE).

A battalion each of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and the Edmonton Regiment was attached and two field hospitals of the 5th Field Ambulance Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC) and detachments of administrative troops accompanied the expedition. The War Office added the 40th Field Battery Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA), with eight 25-pounder field guns from the 11th Field Regiment RCA; Force 111 was ready by 4 August.

The Canadians embarked on in Glasgow, sailed for No. 1 Combined Training Centre at HMS &quot;Quebec&quot; (shore establishment), Inveraray on Loch Fyne and began rehearsing the landings. On 11 August, Potts was told that the operation had been considerably reduced in scope, and on 16 August, Potts was ordered to ensure &quot;that the Germans get no advantage out of Spitzbergen between now and March, 1942&quot;. The operation was to be a landing of a force sufficient for the demolition or the removal of mining equipment, coal and the transport and harbour infrastructure. Wireless and weather stations were to be disabled; the Russians were to be transported to Archangelsk and the Norwegians to Britain.

Russian and Norwegian civilian representatives and a Norwegian army officer, the Governor Designate of Spitzbergen, would accompany the expedition to manage civilian matters. Force 111 returned to Surrey except for the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade HQ with 29 Canadian officers and 498 other ranks from the Edmonton Regiment (Major W. G. Bury) and the 3rd Field Company RCE (Major Geoffrey Walsh), 84 men of the Saskatoon Light Infantry (M.G.) and administrative parties, 14 British officers and 79 men, including 57 Royal Engineers and a Norwegian infantry party (Captain Aubert) with three officers and 22 other ranks, a total of 645 men.

==Operation Gauntlet==

The expedition sailed from the River Clyde on 19 August in &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; and rendezvoused with Force A (Vian) with the cruisers &quot;Nigeria&quot;, &quot;Aurora&quot; and the destroyers , and . The ships put in at Hvalfjörður in Iceland to refuel and departed on the evening of 21 August. Late on 22 August, the destination of the force was revealed to the troops. Force A met the oiler &quot;Oligarch&quot; and its trawler escorts on the evening of 24 August, west of Spitzbergen and as the force approached, an aircraft made a reconnaissance flight over Isfjorden, the large inlet on the western coast of Spitzbergen island, the most populated area of the archipelago. At &quot;Icarus&quot; landed a signal party at the Kap Linne wireless station at the entrance to the fiord, where they were welcomed by the Norwegian operators. The big ships entered Isfjorden, steamed on to Grønfjorden at and anchored off the Soviet mining township of Barentsburg. Potts went ashore to confer with the Soviet authorities about the embarkation of the population and its delivery to Archangelsk as the Canadians occupied other Soviet and Norwegian settlements along Isfjord.
The evacuation proceeded slower than planned because the Soviet Consul wanted machinery and stores loaded on &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; as well as personal effects. &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; set out for Archangelsk at midnight on the night of escorted by &quot;Nigeria&quot; and the destroyers. &quot;Aurora&quot; stayed behind to guard the landing parties and assist in the embarkations from the remoter settlements. The Canadian engineers set fire to about of coal dumped at the mines, fuel oil was poured into the sea or burned and mining equipment was removed or sabotaged, during which, Barentsburg was mysteriously burned down. On the evening of 1 September, the &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; and its escorts returned from Archangelsk to Green Bay.

Normal business was kept up at the wireless station by the Norwegian Military Governor Designate, Lieutenant Ragnvald Tamber except for bogus reports of fog, to deter air reconnaissance. Three colliers sent from the mainland were hijacked along with a whaler, icebreaker, tug and two fishing boats. On 2 September, about 800 Norwegians boarded &quot;Empress&quot; as did 186 French prisoners of war, who had escaped from German captivity and been interned in the USSR until the German invasion. Force A sailed for home at on 3 September, with 800 Norwegian civilians and the prizes, after a ten days&#x27; occupation, having never been in darkness. Anders Halvorssen preferred not to join the Norwegian army-in-exile, hid and remained on the island. The final wireless message was transmitted on the evening of 3 September and the sets at Barentsburg, Longyearbyen, Kap Linné and Grønfjord were destroyed; as Force A made its return journey, a German station was heard calling Spitzbergen. The spurious weather reports had led to the cancellation of weather reconnaissance flights by the ( 5).
On 5 September a sortie was flown over Svalbard and the crew found Spitzbergen deserted and the coal dumps on fire. 5 resumed flights and on 10 September the crew saw Halvorssen waving to them at Longyearbyen. The crew saw a river terrace at Sònak in Adventfjorden, about away, which was about long and could serve as a runway. On 25 September, a Ju 52 landed safely at Sònak but was unable to send a message due to the low power of its radio; a Ju 88 managed to land on 27 September, finding the party and the Norwegian defector. A plan to establish a temporary base was abandoned after an odd illumination, resembling searchlights, was seen in the sky; the two aircraft hurriedly took off for Norway in case it was the British.

The British cruisers diverted towards the Norwegian coast to hunt for German ships and early on 7 September, in stormy weather and poor visibility, found a German convoy off Porsanger Municipality, near the North Cape. The cruisers sank the training ship but &quot;Barcelona&quot; and &quot;Trautenfels&quot;, two troop transports with 1,500 men of the 6th Mountain Division aboard, escaped into the fjord. &quot;Nigeria&quot; was thought to have been damaged hitting a wreck. After the war it was surmised that &quot;Nigeria&quot; had hit a mine. Force A reached to the Clyde on the night of 

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Gauntlet was a success; the Germans had not known of or had been able to challenge the expedition. The raiders had suffered no casualties, the local civilians were repatriated, several ships were taken as prizes and one German warship was sunk on the return journey. After the operation, the British expected the Germans to occupy Svalbard as a base for attacks on Arctic convoys but the Germans were more interested in meteorological data, the Arctic being the origin of much of the weather over western Europe.

===Subsequent operations===

Arctic expert Erich Etienne made a proposal on his return to Norway, to set up a weather station on Svalbard to obtain better weather data and to relieve 5 of the burden of flying in the long night of the polar winter. Operation Bansö () began on 8 October with the flight of a Ju 52 to Svalbard to transport a weather party of four men and ten labourers to convert a house from Longyearbyen, near the landing ground at Sònak. On 18 October, the crew of a Ju 52 heading for Longyearbyen saw several British ships near the island and next day the crew of a Heinkel 111 spotted four British minesweepers in Isfjorden. The two Ju 52s and the He 111 abandoned the airstrip; engine trouble delayed one of the Ju 52s for two hours but clouds of dust in the valley obscured the German aircraft and they went unseen. The all clear was given on 22 October and by 9 November, Bansö was operational, after 38 flights which carried of equipment and 24 builders to the island; on 2 November, a Ju 88 escort for a Ju 52 was caught by a gale-force wind and crashed soon after taking off from Banak, with the loss of the crew.

<doc id="422144" wikidata="Q572079" url="?curid=422144" title="Ceteris paribus">
<text>(also spelled ) (Classical ) is a Latin phrase, meaning &quot;other things equal&quot;; some other English translations of the phrase are &quot;all other things being equal&quot;, &quot;other things held constant&quot;, &quot;all else unchanged&quot;, and &quot;all else being equal&quot;. A statement about a causal, empirical, moral, or logical relation between two states of affairs is &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; if it is acknowledged that the statement, although usually accurate in expected conditions, can fail because of, or the relation can be abolished by, intervening factors.

A &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; assumption is often key to scientific inquiry, because scientists seek to eliminate factors that perturb a relation of interest. Thus epidemiologists, for example, may seek to control independent variables as factors that may influence dependent variables—the outcomes of interest. Likewise, in scientific modeling, simplifying assumptions permit illustration of concepts considered relevant to the inquiry. An example in economics is &quot;If the price of milk falls, ceteris paribus, the quantity of milk demanded will rise.&quot; This means that, if other factors, such as deflation, pricing objectives, utility, and marketing methods, do not change, the decrease in the price of milk will lead to an increase in demand for it.

== Economics ==
Some examples of &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; conditions commonly employed in economics include:
* The number of consumers in the market
* Consumer tastes or preferences
* Prices of substitute goods
* Consumer price expectations
* Personal income 

=== History in economics ===
&quot;Ceteris paribus&quot; has been relevant in economics for centuries, in which the majority of the phrases first uses were in economic contexts, dating back to its first traces in 1295 by Peter Olivi. The earliest case of the Latin phrase being used in the English language publications was in the 17th century by William Petty, who used the clause to condition his labour theory of value. Economist John Stuart Mill’s use of the Latin phrase had significant influences as he characterised economy through how it managed troubling factors. 

Economist Alfred Marshall had significant effects on the popularity for the ceteris paribus clause in the 19th century. It was his support to economics where he promoted partial equilibrium analysis, claiming that this analysis, and similar analysis’ hold due to the ceteris paribus clauses.

The importance that ceteris paribus has brought to economics is not only found in histographical interests, but is still vital to economists today, seen frequently in textbooks.

=== Interpretation ===
One of the disciplines in which &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; clauses are most widely used is economics, in which they are employed to simplify the formulation and description of economic outcomes. When using &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; in economics, one assumes that all other variables except those under immediate consideration are held constant. For example, it can be predicted that if the price of beef &quot;increases&quot;—&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;—the quantity of beef demanded by buyers will &quot;decrease&quot;. In this example, the clause is used to operationally describe everything surrounding the relationship between both the &quot;price&quot; and the &quot;quantity demanded&quot; of an ordinary good.

This operational description intentionally ignores both known and unknown factors that may also influence the relationship between price and quantity demanded, and thus to assume &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; is to assume away any interference with the given example. Such factors that would be intentionally ignored include: a change in the price of substitute goods, (e.g., the price of pork or lamb); a change in the level of risk aversion among buyers (e.g., due to an increase in the fear of mad cow disease); and a change in the level of overall demand for a good regardless of its current price (e.g., a societal shift toward vegetarianism).

The clause is often loosely translated as &quot;holding all else constant.&quot; It does not imply that no other things will in fact change; rather, it isolates the effect of one particular change. Holding all other things constant is directly analogous to using a partial derivative in calculus rather than a total derivative, and to running a regression containing multiple variables rather than just one in order to isolate the individual effect of one of the variables. Ceteris paribus is an extension of scientific modeling. The scientific method is built on identifying, isolating, and testing the impact of an independent variable on a dependent variable.

One thing to note is that since economic variables can only be isolated in theory and not in practice, ceteris paribus can only ever highlight tendencies, not absolutes.

=== Alfred Marshall&#x27;s characterization ===

The clause is used to consider the effect of some causes in isolation, by assuming that other influences are absent. Alfred Marshall expressed the use of the clause as follows:
=== Two uses ===

The above passage by Marshall highlights two ways in which the ceteris paribus clause may be used: The one is hypothetical, in the sense that some factor is assumed fixed in order to analyse the influence of another factor in isolation. This would be hypothetical isolation. An example would be the hypothetical separation of the income effect and the substitution effect of a price change, which actually go together. The other use of the ceteris paribus clause is to see it as a means for obtaining an approximate solution. Here it would yield a substantive isolation.

Substantive isolation has two aspects: temporal and causal. Temporal isolation requires the factors fixed under the ceteris paribus clause to actually move so slowly relative to the other influence that they can be taken as practically constant at any point in time. So, if vegetarianism spreads very slowly, inducing a slow decline in the demand for beef, and the market for beef clears comparatively quickly, we can determine the price of beef at any instant by the intersection of supply and demand, and the changing demand for beef will account for the price changes over time (Temporary Equilibrium Method).

The other aspect of substantive isolation is causal isolation: those factors frozen under a ceteris paribus clause should not significantly be affected by the processes under study. If a change in government policies induces changes in consumers&#x27; behaviour on the same time scale, the assumption that consumer behaviour remains unchanged while policy changes is inadmissible as a substantive isolation (Lucas critique).

===Applications===
The concept of ceteris paribus is crucial for economists and can be applied in researching: 
# Supply chain. Ceteris paribus considers aspects of production, that being competition in the market, production costs, inflation, and consumer trends to conclude pricing of goods, imposing that keeping the aspects of production constant, minimising supply will adjust prices to increase. 
# Law of supply and demand. The law of demand states that, when prices rise the demand of goods fall, whilst the law of supply dictates that as prices rise sellers are more willing to supply. When these laws interrelate market prices and supply in the market are determined. Ceteris paribus is used in the law of supply and demand through determining how independent variables will impact the casual factors of prices and supply in the market. 
# Gross domestic product. Ceteris paribus is used in relation to GDP to determine how the money market will change when variables remain constant.
# Interest rates. Through keeping interest rates as the independent variable, as interest rates rise, thus borrowing costs rise forcing a reduction in the demand for debt, that being the dependent variable.
# Minimum wage. To define the possible effects of a rise in the minimum wage economists will use ceteris paribus. Possible effects include how wage increases may force employments down.

===Limitation of ceteris paribus===

In reality, there are certain limitations for the ceteris paribus condition, in many situations it is not feasible for economists to keep factors constant or make assumptions. When testing, economists are unable to regulate every variable or are able to classify important or potential variables. Although there are certain limitations with the ceteris paribus condition, when researching tendencies in the market it is quite significant.

<doc id="422145" wikidata="Q7396" url="?curid=422145" title="Emperor Mu of Jin">
<text>Emperor Mu of Jin (; 343 – July 10, 361), personal name Sima Dan (), courtesy name Pengzi (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. While he &quot;reigned&quot; 17 years, most of these years were as a child, with the actual power in such figures as his mother Empress Chu Suanzi, He Chong, his granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, Yin Hao, and Huan Wen. It was during his reign that Jin&#x27;s territory temporarily expanded to its greatest extent since the fall of northern China to Han-Zhao, as Huan destroyed Cheng-Han and added its territory to Jin&#x27;s, and Later Zhao&#x27;s collapse allowed Jin to regain most of the territory south of the Yellow River.

==Prior to reign==
Sima Dan was born in 343, during the reign of his father Emperor Kang; his mother was Empress Chu Suanzi, Emperor Kang&#x27;s wife. He was his father&#x27;s only son. When he was only one year old in 344, Emperor Kang grew seriously ill. His granduncles from his paternal grandmother&#x27;s side, the key officials Yu Bing () and Yu Yi (), wanted to support his granduncle, a son of his great-grandfather Emperor Yuan, Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, as the new emperor, but Emperor Kang accepted the advice of another key official, He Chong (), and decided to pass the throne to Sima Dan despite his young age. (He Chong had, two years earlier, given identical advice to Emperor Kang&#x27;s older brother and predecessor Emperor Cheng (i.e., he should pass the throne to a son), advice which was not followed.) He therefore created Sima Dan crown prince. He died less than a month later, and Crown Prince Dan succeeded to the throne as Emperor Mu.

==Under Empress Dowager Chu&#x27;s regency==

Due to Emperor Mu&#x27;s young age, his mother Empress Dowager Chu became the ruling authority at court and served as regent, although she largely followed the advice of He Chong and Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, who served as co-prime ministers. (Sima Yu took that position after Empress Dowager Chu&#x27;s father, Chu Pou (), declined) After He Chong&#x27;s death in 346, his role was taken by Cai Mo.

In 345, after Yu Yi, who had served as the commander of military forces in the western provinces (roughly covering modern Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan), died, the ambitious general Huan Wen (an uncle of Emperor Mu by marriage, having married his aunt Sima Xingnan () the Princess Nankang) was put in charge of those provinces. In late 346, Huan, despite a lack of approval from the central government, started a campaign to conquer Cheng-Han, a rival state that possessed modern Sichuan and Chongqing. In 347, Cheng-Han fell to him, allowing Jin to control all of southern China. From this point, however, Huan became effectively independent in his decision-making over the western provinces. Sima Yu, in apprehension that Huan intended to take over the empire entirely, invited the renowned official Yin Hao to join him and Cai as a high-level official as well, intending to use Yin to counter Huan.

In 349, with rival Later Zhao in a state of disarray following the death of its emperor Shi Hu and the subsequent internecine warfare between his sons and his adopted grandson Shi Min, many of Later Zhao&#x27;s southern provinces switched their allegiance to Jin, and Huan prepared a northern excursion. Instead, the imperial government, under Sima Yu and Yin, sent Emperor Mu&#x27;s grandfather Chu Pou. Chu, however, withdrew after some initial failures, and the campaign resulted in the death of many civilians who were intending to defect to Jin. (He died in distress soon thereafter) Minor campaigns carried out by the general Sima Xun were also largely unsuccessful.

In 350, Yin himself prepared a campaign north, but failed to immediately carry out that campaign; instead, he seized even more power after accusing Cai, by repeatedly declining an honor conferred on him, was being disrespectful to the emperor, and reducing Cai to commoner status. Meanwhile, Huan became impatient after his requests were being rebuffed by Sima Yu and Yin and, around the new year 352, Huan mobilized his troops and gestured as if he were about to attack the capital. Yin was shocked, and initially considered either resigning or send the imperial banner of peace (&quot;Zouyu Fan&quot;, 騶虞幡) to order Huan to stop. After advice from Wang Biaozhi (), however, he instead asked Sima Yu to write a carefully worded letter to Huan, persuading Huan to stop.

Later in 352, Yin launched his own campaign, but upon the start of the campaign, former Later Zhao generals in control of Xuchang and Luoyang rebelled, and his venture had to halt to deal with these rebellions. Subsequently, when his assistants, the generals Xie Shang and Yao Xiang tried to attack Zhang Yu (), the general in control of Xuchang, Former Qin forces came to Zhang&#x27;s aid and defeated Xie&#x27;s troops. Yin then abandoned the campaign entirely.

In fall 352, Yin prepared a second campaign. Initially, the campaign had some success, recovering Xuchang from Former Qin. However, Yin became suspicious of Yao&#x27;s military capabilities and independence, and therefore tried to assassinate Yao. Yao discovered this, and, as Yin headed north, he ambushed Yin&#x27;s troops, inflicting heavy losses on Yin. Yao then took over the Shouchun region. The people despised Yin for his military losses, and Huan submitted a petition demanding Yin&#x27;s ouster. The imperial government was compelled to demote Yin to commoner status and exile him. From that point on, the imperial government was under Sima Yu alone, although it was forced to yield to Huan much of the decision-making power.

In 354, Huan launched a major campaign against Former Qin, but after advancing all the way to the vicinity of Former Qin&#x27;s capital Chang&#x27;an, hesitated on further advancements, and he eventually ran out of food supplies and was forced to withdraw.

In 356, Huan proposed that the capital be moved back to Luoyang (where it had been until its fall to Han-Zhao in 311), but his proposal was rejected. He then carried out a campaign against Yao, who was largely in control of the region at the time. He dealt Yao some severe losses, and Yao eventually tried to advance west and was defeated and killed by Former Qin. Once again in control of the Luoyang region, Huan re-proposed his idea to move the capital back to Luoyang, but the imperial government again declined. Later that year, the Jin vassal Duan Kan (), who was in control of modern Shandong as the Duke of Qi, was defeated by Former Yan&#x27;s general Murong Ke, and his domain was seized by Former Yan.

In spring 357, as Emperor Mu had his rite of passage (at age 13), Empress Dowager Chu terminated her own regency, and from that point on, Emperor Mu became officially the decision maker, although effectively, Sima Yu and Huan Wen continued to make the decisions.

==As &quot;adult&quot; emperor==
In September 357, Emperor Mu married He Fani as his empress.

In 358, Sima Yu offered to resign all of his powers, but Emperor Mu declined. Later that year, a northern campaign by the general Xun Xian, intending to recapture the Shandong Peninsula, failed.

In 359, with Former Yan exerting pressure on Jin possessions south of the Yellow River, the generals Xie Wan (), Zhuge You (), and Chi Tan () advanced north to attack Former Yan, but the forces collapsed after Xie wrongly believed that Former Yan forces were near and ordered a retreat. Without aid, Jin possessions south of the Yellow River began to fall into Former Yan hands.

In July 361, Emperor Mu died without a son. Empress Dowager Chu therefore ordered that his cousin, Sima Pi the Prince of Langya, be made emperor. Sima Pi then succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ai.

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (; also spelt &quot;&#x27;&quot;; ) is the national anthem of Palau. Officially adopted in 1981, the music was composed by Ymesei O. Ezekiel, to which the combined words of several authors were set.

== History ==
The anthem was composed by Ymesei Ezekiel (9 January 1921 – 20 May 1984), a composer, musician and music teacher, during the time of the transition from the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which at the time was using the anthem of Micronesia, to the establishment of the Republic of Palau under the trust territory. A committee headed by member of the House of Delegates Demei Otobed was established to adopt a national anthem in line with the new constitution. Along with Otobed and Ezekiel, other members of the committee included historians and musicians Riosang Salvador, Kebekol Alfonso and Hermana Umetaro. The committee members collectively wrote the lyrics of the anthem. The anthem was officially adopted on 1 January 1981, when the Palauan constitution entered into force.

== Lyrics ==
 Greek Transalation:παI τρίδα μας, Παλάου, υψώνουμε τη σημαία μας με υπερηφάνεια.
II Ας λάμψει το φως της ελευθερίας μας,
Στις καρδιές μας, πάντα δυνατή.
III
Παλάου, Παλάου, χώρα των γενναίων,
Ενωμένοι, θα προχωρήσουμε μπροστά.

<text>Augustin Alexandre Darthé (10 October 1769 – 27 May 1797) was a French revolutionary.

==Life==

===Revolutionary===
Born in Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, he became administrator of the &quot;département&quot; of Pas-de-Calais after the outbreak of the French Revolution, and, as an admirer of Maximilien Robespierre, became a public agitator.

He escaped the death penalty after the Thermidorian Reaction, and befriended François-Noël Babeuf, being one of the main contributors to the conspiracy planned by the latter against the French Directory.

The action ought to have reflected the &quot;Manifesto of Equals&quot;, written by Sylvain Maréchal, aiming at taking the power by violence and forcing an egalitarian society, questioning the fact that democratic elections can be trusted to improve society.

===Arrest and trial===
On 10 May 1796 Babeuf was arrested with many of his associates, among whom was Darthé. The common trial was fixed to take place before the newly constituted High Court of Justice at Vendôme.

On 10 and 11 Fructidor (27 and 28 August 1796), when the prisoners were removed from Paris, there were tentative efforts at a riot and planned rescue, but these were easily suppressed. The attempt of five or six hundred Jacobins (7 September) to rouse the soldiers at Grenelle met with no better success.

The trial, begun at Vendôme on 20 February 1797, lasted two months. On 7 Prairial (26 May) Babeuf and Darthé were sentenced to death, and guillotined at Vendôme the next day (8 Prairial).

<doc id="422167" wikidata="Q49418" url="?curid=422167" title="Rudolf Nebel">
<text>Rudolf Nebel (21 March 1894 – 18 September 1978) was a spaceflight advocate active in Germany&#x27;s amateur rocket group, the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR – &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;) in the 1930s and in rebuilding German rocketry following World War II.

==Early life and involvement in World War I==

Nebel was born in Weißenburg. During the First World War he served in the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; as a fighter pilot with Jagdstaffel 5, pioneering the use of unguided air-launched signal rockets as offensive armament from German fighter aircraft in the Luftstreitkräfte while flying the Halberstadt D.II and Albatros D.III in early 1916, even forcing down two British aircraft with the improvised armament. In his autobiography, he claimed that his controversial approach was internally called &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot;. Following the war, the former &quot;Leutnant&quot; Nebel earned a degree in engineering at the Technical Hochschule of Munich.

==Activities in civilian rocketry and politics before the Second World War==

He was an early member of the German Society for Space Travel (VfR), working closely together with persons such as Wernher von Braun, Rolf Engel, Hermann Oberth or Paul Ehmayr and assisted with the failed publicity stunt to launch a rocket at the premiere of Fritz Lang&#x27;s film &quot;Frau im Mond&quot; (&quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;). Despite this failure, Nebel continued to seek sponsorship from the Reichswehr as well as individuals as diverse as Adolf Hitler and Albert Einstein.

Nebel acted very much as the group&#x27;s spokesperson, organising the donation of materials from various local businesses, and negotiating with the Berlin municipal council for the use of a disused ammunition dump for the VfR&#x27;s launch site or &quot;Raketenflugplatz&quot;. He later talked the Magdeburg council into funding the launch of a rocket with a human passenger on board (Magdeburger Startgerät).

His right-wing politics and affiliation with the paramilitary veterans&#x27; organization &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; sat easily with his promotion of the possible military uses of rockets. Despite this, he had a difficult relationship with Karl Becker of the Army Weapons Office. Becker distrusted Nebel&#x27;s showmanship and publicity seeking and by May 1931 had temporarily cut off official contact with him. In April 1932, Becker accepted a proposal from Nebel for army funding of a rocket launch on the condition that certain criteria were met. The launch on 22 June of that year was a failure and Nebel and his crew received no payment for the attempt. When Becker offered to bring the team into a strictly controlled army rocketry project, Nebel refused, saying that he and his colleagues had invented the technology and that the army would &quot;choke us with their red tape&quot;. Conversely, Wernher von Braun and others accepted the offer.

Von Braun later tried again during the war to have him join, but by now the SS regarded Nebel as untrustworthy and had von Braun cease his attempts.

==Post-war career==

After World War II, Nebel was quick to encourage Germany to recommence rocket research. He participated in the first meetings of the International Astronautical Federation and held a public lecture in Cuxhaven in 1951 that set in motion a chain of events that led to the old military base being re-opened for rocket launching until the mid-1960s. He fought in vain for compensation and recognition and was a scientific employee of the Society for Space Research in Bad Godesberg from 1963 to 1965. In 1972, he published his self-centered autobiography &quot;Die Narren von Tegel&quot; (The Jesters of Tegel), telling his story of the Raketenflugplatz in Berlin-Tegel.

In 1978, he died in Düsseldorf and was buried in Weißenburg, Bavaria.

Nebel, whose name means &quot;fog&quot; in German, is often incorrectly named as the inventor of the &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; (&quot;fog launcher&quot;) system of rocket artillery used by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (German army) in World War II. This secret weapon was given its name as a disinformation strategy designed to lead spies into thinking that it was merely a device for creating a smoke screen.

<doc id="422180" wikidata="Q1205231" url="?curid=422180" title="Telescope mount">
<text>A telescope mount is a mechanical structure which supports a telescope. Telescope mounts are designed to support the mass of the telescope and allow for accurate pointing of the instrument. Many sorts of mounts have been developed over the years, with the majority of effort being put into systems that can track the motion of the fixed stars as the Earth rotates.

== Fixed mounts ==
Fixed telescope mounts are entirely fixed in one position, such as Zenith telescopes that point only straight up and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory&#x27;s Green Bank fixed radio &#x27;horn&#x27; built to observe Cassiopeia A.

==Fixed altitude mounts==
Fixed-altitude mounts usually have the primary optics fixed at an altitude angle while rotating horizontally (in azimuth). They can cover the whole sky but only observe objects for the short time when that object passes a specific altitude and azimuth.

== Transit mounts==
Transit mounts are single axis mounts fixed in azimuth while rotating in altitude, usually oriented on a north-south axis. This allows the telescope to view the whole sky, but only when the Earth&#x27;s rotation allows the objects to cross (&quot;transit&quot;) through that narrow north-south line (the meridian). This type of mount is used in transit telescopes, designed for precision astronomical measurement. Transit mounts are also used to save on cost or where the instruments mass makes movement on more than one axis very difficult, such as large radio telescopes.

== Altazimuth mounts ==
Altazimuth, altitude-azimuth, or &quot;alt-az mounts&quot; allow telescopes to be moved in altitude (up and down), or azimuth (side to side), as separate motions. This mechanically simple mount was used in early telescope designs and until the second half of the 20th century was used as a &quot;less sophisticated&quot; alternative to equatorial mounts since it did not allow tracking of the night sky. This meant until recently it was normally used with inexpensive commercial and hobby constructions. Since the invention of digital tracking systems, altazimuth mounts have come to be used in practically all modern large research telescopes. Digital tracking has also made it a popular telescope mount used in amateur astronomy.

Besides the mechanical inability to easily follow celestial motion the altazimuth mount does have other limitations. The telescope&#x27;s field-of-view rotates at varying speed as the telescope tracks, whilst the telescope body does not, requiring a system to counter-rotate the field of view when used for astrophotography or other types of astronomical imaging. The mount also has blind spot or &quot;zenith hole&quot;, a spot near the zenith where the tracking rate in the azimuth coordinate becomes too high to accurately follow equatorial motion (if the elevation is limited to +90 degrees).

== Alt-alt (altitude-altitude) mounts ==

Alt-alt mounts, or altitude-altitude mounts, are designs similar to horizontal equatorial yoke mounts or Cardan suspension gimbals. This mount is an alternative to the altazimuth mount that has the advantage of not having a blind spot near the zenith, and for objects near the celestial equator the field rotation is minimized. It has the disadvantage of having all the mass, complexity, and engineering problems of its equatorial counterpart, so is only used in specialty applications such as satellite tracking. These mounts may include a third azimuth axis (an &quot;altitude-altitude-azimuth mount&quot;) to rotate the entire mount into an orientation that allows smoother tracking.

== Equatorial mounts ==

The equatorial mount has north-south &quot;polar axis&quot; tilted to be parallel to Earth&#x27;s polar axis that allows the telescope to swing in an east-west arc, with a second axis perpendicular to that to allow the telescope to swing in a north-south arc. Slewing or mechanically driving the mount&#x27;s polar axis in a counter direction to the Earth&#x27;s rotation allows the telescope to accurately follow the motion of the night sky. Equatorial mounts come in different shapes, include German equatorial mounts (GEM in short), equatorial fork mounts, mixed variations on yoke or cross-axis mounts, and equatorial platforms such as the Poncet Platform.

Tilting the polar axis adds a level of complexity to the mount. Mechanical systems have to be engineered to support one or both ends of this axis (such as in fork or yoke mounts). Designs such as German equatorial or cross axis mounts also need large counter weights to counterbalance the mass of the telescope. Larger domes and other structures are also needed to cover the increased mechanical size and range of movement of equatorial mounts. Because of this, equatorial mounts become less viable in very large telescopes and have been pretty much replaced by altazimuth mounts for those applications.

==Hexapod-Telescope==

Instead of the classical mounting using two axes, the mirror is supported by six extendable struts (Stewart-Gough platform). This configuration allows moving the telescope in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides a strong structural integrity.

<doc id="422188" wikidata="Q7201621" url="?curid=422188" title="Plantation desk">
<text>A Plantation desk is an antique desk form. It is thought to have been originally used as a mail desk by postmen. The form is known to have been used on Southern plantations in the United States, but it is not limited to them. For some time communities of Shakers in New England built a large version of this form of desk. It was quite popular in the 19th century.

Basically, the Plantation desk is a Fall front desk with a deeper stand or bottom part. The extra space or ledge of the bottom part of the desk serves as a support for the fall front, thus eliminating the need for retractable supports. Like a normal fall front desk the work surface must be cleared of all materials in order to raise it in a vertical position and thus close off the small drawers and pigeonholes set in front of the user. While the fall front desk was developed by placing a chest on its side, on a stand made for it, to its exact dimensions (as is the case with the Bargueño desk), the plantation desk form was devised by placing such a chest on its side, on a table a bit too deep for it. The fall front usually settles at a slight angle once it is open, in order to give a slanted work surface to the user.

Some plantation desks have two panel doors instead of a fall front and the ledge is hence much deeper since it serves as the main desktop surface.

<doc id="422194" wikidata="Q11975610" url="?curid=422194" title="Hoi polloi">
<text>The English expression the hoi polloi (; ) was borrowed from Ancient Greek, where it means &quot;the many&quot; or, in the strictest sense, &quot;the people&quot;. In English, it has been given a negative connotation to signify the common people. Synonyms for &quot;hoi polloi&quot; include &quot;the plebs&quot; (plebeians), &quot;the rabble&quot;, &quot;the masses&quot;, &quot;the great unwashed&quot;, &quot;the &quot;, and &quot;the proles&quot; (proletarians).

Interestingly, there is also widespread spoken use of the term in the opposite sense to refer denigratingly to elites that is common among middle-class and lower income people in several English-speaking countries and regions, including at least Australia, North America, and Scotland since at least the 1950s.

The phrase probably became known to English scholars through Pericles&#x27; Funeral Oration, as mentioned in Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;. Pericles uses it in a positive way when praising the Athenian democracy, contrasting it with &quot;hoi oligoi&quot;, &quot;the few&quot; (Greek: ; see also &quot;oligarchy&quot;).

Its current English usage originated in the early 19th century, a time when it was generally accepted that one must be familiar with Greek and Latin in order to be considered well educated. The phrase was originally written in Greek letters. Knowledge of these languages served to set apart the speaker from &quot;hoi polloi&quot; in question, who were not similarly educated.

==Pronunciation==
The term is of course pronounced very differently in English, Ancient Greek, and Modern Greek:
* English educated speakers pronounce it , but use in the opposite sense of &quot;elites&quot; usually has initial stress on &quot;polloi&quot;.
* Ancient Greek had phonemic consonant length, or gemination. Speakers would have pronounced it with the double-λ being geminated. 
* Modern Greek speakers pronounce it since in Modern Greek there is no voiceless glottal /h/ phoneme and &quot;οι&quot; is pronounced (all Ancient Greek diphthongs are now pronounced as monophthongs). Greek Cypriots still pronounce the double-λ ().

==Usage==
Some linguists argue that, given that &quot;hoi&quot; is a definite article, the phrase &quot;the hoi polloi&quot; is redundant, akin to saying &quot;the the masses&quot;. Others argue that this is inconsistent with other English loanwords. The word &quot;alcohol&quot;, for instance, derives from the Arabic &quot;al-kuhl&quot;, &quot;al&quot; being an article, yet &quot;the alcohol&quot; is universally accepted as good grammar.

==Appearances in the nineteenth century==

There have been numerous uses of the term in English literature. James Fenimore Cooper, author of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, is often credited with making the first recorded usage of the term in English. The first recorded use by Cooper occurs in his 1837 work &quot;Gleanings in Europe&quot; where he writes &quot;After which the oi polloi are enrolled as they can find interest.&quot;
Lord Byron had, in fact, previously used the term in his letters and journal. In one journal entry, dated 24 November 1813, Byron writes:

Byron also wrote an 1821 entry in his journal &quot;... one or two others, with myself, put on masks, and went on the stage with the &#x27;oi polloi.&quot;

In &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot;, Thomas De Quincey uses the term during a passage discussing which of the English classes is most proud, noting &quot;... the children of bishops carry about with them an austere and repulsive air, indicative of claims not generally acknowledged, a sort of &quot;noli me tangere&quot; manner, nervously apprehensive of too familiar approach, and shrinking with the sensitiveness of a gouty man from all contact with the οι πολλοι.&quot;
While Charles Darwin was at the University of Cambridge from 1828 to 1831, undergraduates used the term &quot;hoi polloi&quot; or &quot;Poll&quot; for those reading for an &quot;ordinary&quot; degree, the &quot;pass degree&quot;. At that time only capable mathematicians would take the Tripos or honours degree. In his autobiography written in the 1870s, Darwin recalled that &quot;By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the οἱ πολλοί, or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.&quot;

W. S. Gilbert used the term in 1882 when he wrote the libretto of the comic opera Iolanthe. In Act I, the following exchange occurs between a group of disgruntled fairies who are arranging to elevate a lowly shepherd to the peerage, and members of the House of Lords who will not hear of such a thing:

Gilbert&#x27;s parallel use of &quot;canaille&quot;, &quot;plebs&quot; (&quot;plebeians&quot;), and &quot;hoi polloi&quot; makes it clear that the term is derogatory of the lower classes. In many versions of the vocal score, it is written as &quot;οἱ πολλοί&quot;, likely confusing generations of amateur choristers who couldn&#x27;t read Greek.

John Dryden used the phrase in his &quot;Essay of Dramatick Poesie&quot;, published in 1668. Dryden spells the phrase with Greek letters, but the rest of the sentence is in English (and he does precede it with &quot;the&quot;).

==Appearances in the twentieth century==
The term has appeared in several films and radio programs. For example, one of the earliest short films from the Three Stooges, &quot;Hoi Polloi&quot; (1935), opens in an exclusive restaurant where two wealthy gentlemen are arguing whether heredity or environment is more important in shaping character. They make a bet and pick on nearby trashmen (the Stooges) to prove their theory. At the conclusion of three months in training, the Stooges attend a dinner party, where they thoroughly embarrass the professors.

The University of Dayton&#x27;s Don Morlan says, &quot;The theme in these shorts of the Stooges against the rich is bringing the rich down to their level and shaking their heads.&quot; A typical Stooges joke from the film is when someone addresses them as &quot;gentlemen&quot;, and they look over their shoulders to see who is being addressed. The Three Stooges turn the tables on their hosts by calling them &quot;hoi polloi&quot; at the end.

At the English public school (i.e., private school) Haileybury and Imperial Service College, in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, grammar schoolboys from nearby Hertford were referred to as &quot;oips&quot;, from &quot;hoi polloi&quot;, to distinguish them from comprehensive and secondary modern schoolboys, the lowest of the low, who were called &quot;oiks&quot;.

Carole King&#x27;s TV special &quot;Really Rosie&quot; (based on Maurice Sendak&#x27;s works) contains a song called &quot;My Simple Humble Neighborhood&quot;, in which Rosie remembers those whom she&#x27;s met over the years. In the process, she mentions the hoi polloi as well as the grand elite.

The term continues to be used in contemporary writing. In his 1983 introduction to Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot;, Israel Regardie writes, &quot;Once I was even so presumptuous as to warn (Wilson) in a letter that his humor was much too good to waste on hoi polloi who generally speaking would not understand it and might even resent it.&quot;

The term &quot;hoi polloi&quot; was used in a dramatic scene in the film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989). In this scene, Professor Keating speaks negatively about the use of the article &quot;the&quot; in front of the phrase:

Keating&#x27;s tone makes clear that he considers this statement to be an insult. He used the phrase &quot;the hoi polloi&quot;, to demonstrate the mistake he warned against.

The term was also used in the comedy film &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980). In a rare moment of cleverness, Spaulding Smails greets Danny Noonan as he arrives for the christening of The Flying Wasp, the boat belonging to Judge Elihu Smails (Spaulding&#x27;s grandfather), with &quot;Ahoy, polloi! Where did you come from, a scotch ad?&quot; This is particularly ironic, because Danny has just finished mowing the Judge&#x27;s lawn, and arrives overdressed, wearing a sailboat captain&#x27;s outfit (as the girl seated next to him points out, Danny &quot;looks like Dick Cavett&quot;).

Todd Rundgren&#x27;s band Utopia recorded a song titled &quot;Hoi Polloi&quot; on their album &quot;Deface the Music&quot; (1980), in which all of the songs are written and performed in the style of the Beatles.

The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s song &quot;Jug Band Music&quot; includes the line: &quot;He tried to mooch a towel from the hoi polloi.&quot;

In the song &quot;Risingson&quot; on Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot; album, the singer apparently appeals to his company to leave the club they&#x27;re in, deriding the common persons&#x27; infatuation with them, and implying that he&#x27;s about to slide into antisocial behaviour:

In an episode of &quot;This American Life&quot;, radio host Ira Glass uses the term hoi polloi while relaying a story about a woman who believes the letter &#x27;q&#x27; should occur later in the alphabet. He goes on to say that &quot;Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is, with the hoi polloi of the alphabet, with your &#x27;m&#x27; &#x27;n&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27;. Letters that will just join any word for the asking.&quot;

The term was used in a first-series episode (The New Vicar, aired 5 November 1990) of the British sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. The main character, Hyacinth Bucket, gets into a telephone argument with a bakery employee. When the employee abruptly hangs up in frustration, Hyacinth disparagingly refers to him as &quot;hoi polloi&quot;. This is in keeping with her character; she looks down upon those she considers to be of lesser social standing, including working-class people.

Hoi Polloi was used in Larry Marder&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Beanworld&quot; to name the unusual group of creatures that lived beneath the Beanworld.

In the first scene of The PlayStation ad &quot;Double Life,&quot; a British man says, &quot;In the day, I do my job, I ride the bus, Roll up my sleeves with the Hoi polloi&quot;.

Sue Townsend&#x27;s Adrian Mole writes a poem called &quot;The Hoi Polloi Reception&quot; and later works as a cook &quot;offal chef&quot; in a Soho restaurant called Hoi Polloi.

The Scottish punk rock band Oi Polloi were named from a pun of the Greek phrase.

==Appearances in the twenty-first century==
The August 14, 2001 episode of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; program included a discussion about whether the sport of polo was an appropriate part of the image of the British Royal Family. Joining King on the program were &quot;best-selling biographer and veteran royal watcher Robert Lacey&quot; and Kitty Kelley, author of the book &quot;The Royals&quot;. Their discussions focused on Prince Charles and his son Prince William:

The term appears in the 2003 Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, where it is used by the characters Elphaba and Glinda to refer to the many inhabitants of the Emerald City: &quot;... I wanna be in this hoi polloi ...&quot;

The term also appears in the 2007 film &quot;Hairspray&quot;, where it is used by the character Edna saying: &quot;You see me hobnobbing and drinking Rum and Cokes with all those hoi polloi?&quot;

Jack Cafferty, a CNN anchorman, was caught misusing the term. On 9 December 2004 he retracted his statement, saying &quot;And hoi-polloi refers to common people, not those rich morons that are evicting those two red-tail hawks (ph) from that fifth Avenue co-op. I misused the word hoi-polloi. And for that I humbly apologize.&quot;

New media and new inventions have also been described as being by or for the hoi polloi. Bob Garfield, co-host of NPR&#x27;s &quot;On the Media&quot; program, 8 November 2005, used the phrase in reference to changing practices in the media, especially Wikipedia, &quot;The people in the encyclopedia business, I understand, tend to sniff at the wiki process as being the product of the mere hoi polloi.&quot;

In &quot;Sunk Costs&quot; (season 3 episode 3) of &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, Jimmy has been arrested and the DDA (Oakley) teases him &quot;getting fingerprinted with the hoi polloi&quot;.

In &quot;Hooray! Todd Episode!&quot; (season 4 episode 3) of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, Princess Carolyn (in the hopes of making a celebrity actress more relatable to the public) orders a press release to be prepared, stating &quot;Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy&quot;, referring to Todd as a &quot;down-to-earth boring nobody&quot;.

Cellar Darling uses the expression as the lyrical hook in the song &quot;The Hermit&quot; from their debut album &quot;This Is the Sound&quot;.

<text>Gua sha, or kerokan (in Indonesia), is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practice in which a tool is used to scrape people&#x27;s skin in order to produce light petechiae. Practitioners believe that &quot;gua sha&quot; releases unhealthy bodily matter from blood stasis within sore, tired, stiff, or injured muscle areas to stimulate new oxygenated blood flow to the areas, thus promoting healing and recovery. 

&quot;Gua sha&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;scraping&quot;, &quot;spooning&quot; or &quot;coining&quot; by English speakers. The treatment has also been known by the French name, &quot;tribo-effleurage&quot;. 

&quot;Gua sha&quot; is a pseudoscience, has no known health benefits and can have adverse effects, some of them potentially serious.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Gua sha&quot;, the literal translation being &quot;to scrape petechia&quot; which refers to the sand-like bruising after the treatment, spread from China to Vietnam, where it became very popular. It is known as &quot;cạo gió&quot;, which roughly means &quot;to scrape wind&quot;, as in Vietnamese culture &quot;catching a cold&quot; or fever is often referred to as &quot;trúng gió&quot;, &quot;to catch wind&quot;. The origin of this term is the &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot;, a c. 220 CE Chinese medical text on illness caused by cold. As in most Asian countries, China&#x27;s medical practices were a profound influence in Vietnam, especially between the 5th and 7th centuries CE. &quot;Cạo gió&quot; is an extremely common practice in Vietnam and for expatriate Vietnamese.

== Technique ==
&quot;Gua sha&quot; involves repeated pressed strokes over lubricated skin with a smooth-edged, blunt instrument. Skin is typically lubricated with massage oil or balm, and commonly a ceramic Chinese soup spoon was used, or a blunt, well-worn coin, even honed animal bones, water buffalo horn, or jade, or even a simple metal cap with a blunt rounded edge is used.

In cases of fatigue from heavy manual labor work, a piece of ginger root soaked in rice wine is sometimes used to rub down the spine from top to bottom.

The smooth edge is placed against the oiled skin surface, pressed down firmly, and then moved down the muscles—hence the term &quot;tribo-effleurage&quot; (i.e., friction-stroking)—or along the pathway of the acupuncture meridians, along the surface of the skin, with each stroke being about 4–6 inches long.

Practitioners tend to follow the tradition they were taught to obtain &quot;sha&quot;: typically using either &quot;gua sha&quot; or fire cupping. The techniques are sometimes used together. In China, both &quot;gua sha&quot; and fire cupping are widely available in institutions ranging from national and public hospitals to private massage shops. Due to local peoples&#x27; deep trust in traditional Chinese medicine and the treatments&#x27; reasonable price, both are very popular.

== Dangers and lack of efficacy ==
There is no clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of &quot;gua sha&quot;. In use, it nearly always damages the skin. Negative side effects of &quot;gua sha&quot; range from minor ones – including dermatitis, burns and blood in the urine – to rare major effects including bleeding in the brain and severe injuries requiring skin grafts.

The use of hospital standards of sterilization and personal protective equipment is important to prevent infections. Although no cases of blood-borne pathogens have been reported, the risk of transmission of blood cells and fluids cannot be ruled out, as with all contact producers. Protective measurements against infectious agents that are recommended include the single use of disposable devices, sterilization of re-used equipment, and glove use. Lubricants should be poured out into cups and they are to be disposed of after each use. Materials that cannot be adequately sterilized such as horn and bone are not recommended.

== Cross-cultural confusion with physical abuse ==
A slightly different form of &quot;gua sha&quot; using the edges of coins rather than porcelain items is practiced as a folk medicine technique. Individuals practice this &quot;coining&quot;, also known as &quot;cao gio&quot; (literally &quot;scratching the wind&quot;), amongst their own family members in many Asian countries, such as Vietnam or in Cambodia known as kaos khyal/kors kha-yal (កោសខ្យល់) literally meaning scratch the wind, and also in their respective emigrant communities abroad. Health care practitioners in hospitals in Orange County, California, routinely see evidence of coining among hospitalized Vietnamese patients.

In 1980, it was found that many Vietnamese still distrusted U.S. medical practitioners in part due to fear of being accused of child abuse. This practice has been misidentified as child abuse in case reports, despite the intention of the parents. Physicians are required by law to report injuries from remedies such as coining to the appropriate agency (e.g., state child-protective service or state adult-protective service), regardless of intention.

=== In popular culture ===
The 2001 movie &quot;The Gua Sha Treatment&quot; was made in Hong Kong and featured &quot;gua sha&quot;. In the film, an American child welfare agency interprets gua sha treatment as abuse and seeks to take a child away from his father. The movie concerns cultural conflict experienced by a Chinese-American immigrant family, and a theme of the film is that violence is difficult to define, and the definitions often relate to culture.

In 2021 and 2022, the practice went viral on TikTok.

<doc id="422211" wikidata="Q2459273" url="?curid=422211" title="Tug McGraw">
<text>Frank Edwin &quot;Tug&quot; McGraw Jr. (August 30, 1944 – January 5, 2004) was an American professional baseball relief pitcher. McGraw played in 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1965 to 1984, for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, earning a total of over $2 million. He is often remembered for coining the phrase &quot;Ya Gotta Believe&quot;, which became the rallying cry for the 1973 New York Mets and has since become a popular slogan for the team and fans.

McGraw struck out Willie Wilson to end the 1980 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, bringing the Philadelphia Phillies their first World Series championship in franchise history.

McGraw was one of six Phillies players to die prematurely from glioblastoma, a brain cancer. Although it cannot be proven definitively, a theory links the cancer to toxic PFAS chemicals in the AstroTurf at Veterans Stadium.

==Early life==
Frank Edwin &quot;Tug&quot; McGraw Jr. was born August 30, 1944, in Martinez, California, the second of three sons of Frank Edwin &quot;Big Mac&quot; McGraw Sr. and Mable McKenna. McGraw got the nickname &quot;Tugger&quot; from his mother because of the particularly aggressive way he breast-fed. The name stuck and McGraw preferred it, even asking to be called &quot;Tug&quot; by his kindergarten teacher. His mother was bipolar and was physically and verbally abusive. She abandoned the family after spending time in Napa State Mental Hospital and the family was raised by Frank McGraw Sr. His father was athletic and was a butcher, trucker, and fireman and then a water treatment plant operator and engineer who encouraged the children to play sports. He was the great-grandson of Irish immigrants. After his divorce in the early 1950s, Frank Sr. moved his three sons to nearby Vallejo. Tug graduated from St. Vincent Ferrer High School, a Catholic school in Vallejo, in 1962. McGraw enrolled in Vallejo Junior College (now Solano Community College).

==Career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1961, Tug&#x27;s brother Hank had signed with the New York Mets by scout Roy Partee; Hank later asked Partee to look into signing Tug, threatening to quit if Tug was not signed. On June 12, 1964, McGraw signed with the New York Mets as an amateur free agent, receiving a $7,000 signing bonus. McGraw was used both as a starting pitcher and as a relief pitcher in Minor League Baseball at Cocoa Beach, Florida, where he pitched a no-hitter in his debut in Auburn, New York. He went 6–4 that year with a 1.64 earned run average.

===New York Mets (1965–1967, 1969–1974)===
McGraw qualified for the Mets in Spring training in 1965 at age 20, without ever having played double- or triple-A ball. There, he played under manager Casey Stengel, who retired that year. He made his major league debut on April 18, 1965, as a reliever, against the New York Giants. After striking out Orlando Cepeda in his debut, he was given a tranquilizer to calm down.

McGraw made the team as a reliever, and was 0–1 with a 3.12 ERA and one save when he made his first major league start on July 28 against the Chicago Cubs in the second game of a double header at Wrigley Field. He lasted just two-thirds of an inning and gave up three earned runs on his way to a 9–0 loss (the Cubs blew the Mets out in the first game as well, 7–2). On August 22, in his second start, also in the second game of a double header, only this time against the St. Louis Cardinals at Shea Stadium, McGraw pitched a complete game to earn his first major league win. On August 26, he won his next start, 5–2 over Sandy Koufax and the Los Angeles Dodgers. It marked the first time the Mets had ever beaten Koufax. McGraw remained in the Mets&#x27; starting rotation for the remainder of the season, however, failed to log another win, going 2–6 as a starter, and 0–1 in relief.

The Mets used McGraw as a starter again in 1966, and he was 2–9 with a 5.52 ERA in that role. Though he also made four starts with the Mets in 1967, McGraw spent most of the season, and all of 1968 in the minor leagues with the Jacksonville Suns. In 1968, he went 9-9 with a 3.42 ERA for the Suns. By the time he returned to the Mets in 1969, manager Gil Hodges had a very capable young pitching rotation that included Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Gary Gentry and had no need for McGraw as a starter until Koosman went down with an injury in May. McGraw went 1–1 with a 5.23 ERA filling in for Koosman.

Koosman returned to the rotation at the end of the month and on May 28, after a five-game losing streak that saw the Mets fall into fourth place in the newly aligned National League East, Koosman and the expansion San Diego Padres&#x27; Clay Kirby engaged in a pitchers&#x27; duel at Shea. After nine scoreless innings by Kirby and ten by Koosman, the game was turned over to the bullpens for extra innings. The game finally ended after 11 innings when Bud Harrelson hit a single to drive in Cleon Jones. McGraw pitched the 11th inning to earn the win. 

In June 1969, manager Gil Hodges suggested that Tug should become a relief pitcher, a decision he agreed with and that changed his career. 

This began an 11-game winning streak that brought them into second place, seven games behind the Chicago Cubs. McGraw earned two saves during that stretch, and 12 for the season. His record as a reliever was 8–2 with a 1.47 ERA.

The Cubs had been in first place in the NL East for 156 days of the season, and they seemed likely to win the division when they came to New York City to open a crucial two-game series with the Mets on September 8. The Mets won both games to close within a half game of the Cubs. The following day, the Mets swept a double header from the expansion Montreal Expos. Coupled with a Cubs loss (who had slumped to a 9–17 record in their final 26 games), the Mets moved into first place for the first time ever during the season.

On September 15, the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Steve Carlton struck out a record 19 Mets in a losing effort, as the Mets defeated the Cards 4–3 at Busch Memorial Stadium on a pair of two-run home runs by Ron Swoboda. McGraw pitched the final three innings without giving up a run to earn the win in this game. On September 24, facing Carlton and the Cardinals, again — only this time at Shea Stadium, the New York Mets clinched the NL East as Donn Clendenon hit two home runs in a 6–0 Mets victory. The Mets won 39 of their last 50 games, and finished the season with 100 wins against 62 losses, eight games over the second place Cubs.

McGraw&#x27;s first postseason appearance came in game two of the new 1969 National League Championship Series (NLCS). After the Atlanta Braves scored six runs off Koosman in innings, Ron Taylor and McGraw held the Braves scoreless the remainder of the way to secure the Mets&#x27; 11–6 victory. He did not appear in any other games during the 1969 postseason, in which the Mets won the World Series. McGraw said that &quot;Everything changed for me in 1969&quot;. That year he went to Vietnam on a goodwill tour; he was slapped by Ron Taylor for smoking marijuana. He received a $10,000 bonus for being on the World Series team; he used $7,000 to buy a white Mercedes-Benz convertible, which was given to his son after he died.

====&quot;Ya Gotta Believe!&quot;====
McGraw emerged as one of the top closers in the National League in the early 1970s, enjoying a career year in 1972. He was 3–3 with a 2.01 ERA and 15 saves at the All-Star break to earn his first All-Star selection. McGraw pitched two innings, striking out four and giving up only one hit to earn the win in the NL&#x27;s 4–3 come from behind victory. For the season, McGraw went 8–6 with a 1.70 ERA, giving up just 71 hits in 106 innings pitched, and setting a Mets record with 27 saves that lasted until 1984.

Whereas 1973 wasn&#x27;t as good a year statistically for McGraw, he was valued for the leadership role he assumed for the league champions. The Mets had fallen into last place in the NL East, and had remained there through August 30. McGraw was the winning pitcher for the Mets on August 31 when the Mets emerged from last place with an extra innings victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The win improved McGraw&#x27;s record to 2–6 with a 5.05 ERA.

For the remainder of the season, McGraw went 3–0 with a 0.57 ERA and ten saves. The Mets, meanwhile, went 20–8 from that point forward to pull off the stunning division title. At a July 9 team meeting where Mets Board Chairman M. Donald Grant was trying to encourage the team, McGraw shouted the words, &quot;Ya Gotta Believe&quot; which became a popular rallying cry for the Mets. He said the famous phrase when maybe only he believed the Mets could actually get to the World Series. But soon enough, hearing McGraw say it again and again, seeing him do his magic in the ninth, the Mets themselves came to believe. They pulled into first place on September 21 with a 10–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and clinched the division crown on the final day of the season with a win over the Cubs. This was the only season between and that the National League East wasn&#x27;t won by either Philadelphia or Pittsburgh.

McGraw continued his dominant pitching into the postseason, when he pitched five innings over two games in the NLCS against the defending NL champion Cincinnati Reds without giving up a run, and appeared in five of the seven games of the World Series against the defending champion Oakland Athletics. Though he blew the save in game two, he pitched three shutout innings in extra innings to earn the win.

McGraw was traded along with Don Hahn and Dave Schneck from the Mets to the Philadelphia Phillies for Del Unser, John Stearns, and Mac Scarce at the Winter Meetings on December 3, 1974. McGraw had developed shoulder trouble during a season in which he went 6–11 with a 4.15 ERA, and at the time of the trade, it appeared as if the Mets may have been unloading damaged goods. After the trade, he was diagnosed with a simple cyst and after successful surgery to remove it, recovered completely. McGraw left the Mets as the all-time leader in saves, games pitched, and games finished.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1975–1984)===
With the Phillies, he continued his role as a reliable relief pitcher, earning his second career All-Star nod in his first season in Philadelphia, though he did not appear in the game. After finishing second to the Pirates in 1975, McGraw&#x27;s Phillies won their division crown the next three seasons. They were, however, unable to reach the World Series as they were swept by Cincinnati&#x27;s &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; in the 1976 NLCS, and fell to the Los Angeles Dodgers the following two seasons.

McGraw was nearly traded along with Bake McBride and Larry Christenson to the Texas Rangers for Sparky Lyle and Johnny Grubb at the 1979 Winter Meetings in Toronto, but the proposed transaction was never executed because a deferred money issue in Lyle&#x27;s contract went unresolved.

The Phillies were battling back-and-forth for first place with the Montreal Expos in 1980 when the Expos came to Veterans Stadium for a crucial three game set on September 25. The Phillies won two of the three, with McGraw winning the second game, to pull a half game up on Montreal. By the time the Phillies went to Montreal for the final series of the season, the two teams were tied for first place.

The Phillies won the opener, 2–1. McGraw earned the save by striking out five of the six batters he faced. The following day, McGraw entered the game in the ninth inning, with the score tied at four. McGraw pitched three innings, striking out three and only giving up one hit, a tenth-inning lead-off single by Jerry White. It was also one of just two balls to leave the infield once McGraw entered the game. After Mike Schmidt&#x27;s 11th-inning home run put the Phillies up 6–4, McGraw pitched a 1–2–3 11th inning, striking out Larry Parrish to end the game, and clinch the National League East for the Phillies for the fourth time since joining the club.

For the season, McGraw went 5–4 with a 1.46 ERA, 75 strikeouts and 20 saves. Phillies starter Steve Carlton won the National League Cy Young Award, and slugging third baseman Mike Schmidt was the unanimous NL MVP. McGraw received consideration in balloting for both awards as well, finishing fifth in Cy Young balloting, and 16th for league MVP.

====1980 World Champions====
McGraw pitched in all five games of the 1980 NLCS against the Houston Astros. The Phillies won the first game 3–1, with McGraw earning the save. The Astros, however, came back in game two with an extra innings victory to send the series to Houston tied at a game apiece.

McGraw entered game three in the eighth inning with a runner on second, and one out. He managed to get out of the inning, and keep the Astros scoreless until the 11th inning, when Joe Morgan led the inning off with a triple. Rafael Landestoy entered the game as a pinch runner for Morgan, and McGraw intentionally walked the next two batters to create a force at any base. The strategy didn&#x27;t work, as the following batter, Denny Walling, hit a sacrifice fly to Greg Luzinski in left field scoring Landestoy.

The final two games of the series also went into extra innings. He earned a save in game four to even the series, however, blew the save in the fifth and deciding game, allowing it to go into extra innings. Dick Ruthven entered the game in the ninth and pitched two perfect innings. Meanwhile, the Phillies came back with a run in the tenth to proceed to the World Series against the Kansas City Royals.

McGraw appeared in four of the six games of the World Series, striking out ten batters in 7.2 innings. The Phillies swept the first two games in Philadelphia, with McGraw earning the save in game one. The Royals, however, came back to even the series after two games in Kansas City, with McGraw picking up the loss in game three.

McGraw entered game five in the seventh inning with the Phillies behind 3–2. He pitched three scoreless innings, while his team scored two ninth inning runs off Royals closer Dan Quisenberry to head back to Philadelphia with a 3–2 series lead. McGraw entered game six of the World Series in the eighth inning with no outs, and runners on first and second, and the Phillies up, 4–0. He allowed one inherited base runner to score, but managed to get through the inning relatively unscathed. After giving up a walk and two singles to load the bases in the ninth inning, he struck out Willie Wilson, clinching the Phillies&#x27; first World Series championship.

The next day, at a victory rally at John F. Kennedy Stadium, McGraw summed it all up for the fans after 97 years of futility for the Phillies franchise:

In later years, McGraw expressed remorse toward his comments toward New York. He returned to Shea Stadium on numerous occasions following his retirement, citing his love for the Mets fans.

====Final four seasons====
McGraw went 2–4 with a 2.66 ERA and ten saves in the strike-shortened 1981 season. The Phillies won the first half season crown, however, lost the 1981 National League Division Series to the Montreal Expos. On March 17, 1981, McGraw wore a dyed green uniform on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day to a spring training game, though an umpire refused to let him play. McGraw called St. Patrick&#x27;s Day his favorite holiday. Since 1989, the Phillies have had a tradition of playing in green on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

In 1982, McGraw shifted into more of a set-up man role, with both Ron Reed and Ed Farmer earning more saves than he on the season. Prior to the start of the 1983 season, the Phillies acquired Al Holland from the San Francisco Giants to assume the closer role. Following the 1984 season, McGraw retired at age 40. As a favor to longtime friend Roman Gabriel, he returned to professional baseball for single starts during the 1989 and 1990 minor league seasons with the Class A Gastonia Rangers of the South Atlantic League.

==Career statistics==


Whereas relief pitchers are not given the opportunity to bat frequently, McGraw was allowed to bat leading off the sixth inning of a 6–0 blowout at the hands of the Montreal Expos on September 8, . He rewarded his manager&#x27;s faith in him by putting the Mets on the board with his only career home run.

McGraw could also throw right-handed and would often loosen up before games by playing right-handed catch with his teammates, leaving fans wondering who the right-hander wearing number 45 was. At the time of his death, McGraw was ranked:
*24th on the all-time major league list in games pitched (824)
*22nd on the all-time major league list in games finished (541)
*4th on the all-time Mets list in games saved (86)
*4th on the all-time Mets list in games finished (228)
*5th on the all-time Mets list in most games pitched (361)
*7th on the all-time Mets list in least hits per nine innings (7.78)
*10th on the all-time Mets list in most batters struck out per nine innings (7.02)
*1st on the all-time Phillies list in games finished (313)
*3rd on the all-time Phillies list in games pitched (500)
*4th on the all-time Phillies list in saves (94)
*8th on the all-time Phillies list in least hits per nine innings (7.89)

==Other work==
In the 1980s and 1990s, he was a sports anchor and reporter for Action News on WPVI, the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia. He appeared as himself in a 1999 episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; along with several other members of the 1969 New York Mets.

In the mid-1970s, McGraw collaborated with artist Michael Witte on a nationally syndicated comic strip, &quot;Scroogie&quot;. Scroogie was a relief pitcher for the &quot;Pets&quot;, whose teammates included &quot;Tyrone&quot; (a Reggie Jackson–like bopper with a tremendous ego), ace pitcher &quot;Royce Rawls&quot; (loosely based upon former Mets teammate, Tom Seaver), &quot;Chico&quot;, a Hispanic shortstop with characteristics similar to Mario Mendoza, and &quot;Homer&quot;, an intellectually challenged slugger who could send a ball into orbit. Their announcer, &quot;Herb&quot;, wore loud sports coats reminiscent of former Mets announcer Lindsey Nelson, and the team was owned by Millicent Cashman. Actual major league teams and players were used in the comic strip during its two-year run.

McGraw, Witte, David Fisher and Neil Offer produced two books, &quot;Scroogie&quot; (1976) and &quot;Hello there, ball!&quot; (1977).

McGraw also recorded a version of the baseball poem &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;, accompanied by Peter Nero and the Philly Pops.

==Personal life==
McGraw had a brief relationship in 1966 with Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; D&#x27;Agostino, a teenage neighbor and waitress, that resulted in a son, country music singer Tim McGraw. In his book &quot;Ya Gotta Believe&quot;, McGraw wrote that he and D&#x27;Agostino only had sex once and that she immediately broke off contact with him and left town afterward. At the time, McGraw was playing baseball for Jacksonville, while D&#x27;Agostino was a high school student. When she became pregnant, her parents forced D&#x27;Agostino to drop out of high school and move to Delhi, Louisiana to live with relatives, where she gave birth to Tim.

McGraw did not meet his son until his son was 11 years old, after Tim accidentally found his birth certificate in his mother&#x27;s closet and inquired about his true father. McGraw told his son that he had another family and could not be a father to Tim, although Tim persevered in sending his father letters. In early 1985, with Tug&#x27;s success differing from the financial difficulties of Betty, Betty filed suit and the State of Louisiana demanded $350,000 in back child support. Through a lawyer, McGraw then agreed to finance $42,000 for Tim&#x27;s college education, take a paternity test, and meet with his son. At the meeting, they reconciled, and began to develop a closer relationship. In 1990, with his son&#x27;s career first starting, Tug bought Tim a van for him and his band to travel. In addition to Tim, McGraw had a son, Mark, and daughter, Cari, with his first wife Phyllis Kline, and a son, Matthew, with his wife Diane Hovenkamp-Robertson; he also had two stepsons, Christopher and Ian Hovenkamp.

===Marine Corps Reserve service (1965)===
After one season in Major League Baseball with the New York Mets, McGraw reported to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island on September 23, 1965, along with fellow New York Mets pitcher Jim Bethke. He was trained as a rifleman on the M14 rifle and M60 machine gun. McGraw later reported to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, where he (in his own words) became a &quot;trained killer&quot;. Tug&#x27;s younger brother Dennis was active in anti-war protests and the brothers would sometimes argue; however, Tug admitted that he was a &quot;dove when it came to the way [the United States was] conducting the war&quot;.

===Death===
On March 12, 2003, McGraw was working as an instructor for the Phillies during spring training when he was hospitalized with a glioblastoma brain tumor. After surgery was performed to remove it, initial reports suggested the procedure had been successful, his chances for recovery were &quot;excellent&quot; and he would live &quot;a long time&quot;. However, the tumor was not totally excised by the surgery and the malignancy returned in inoperable form. McGraw lived for over nine months after the initial surgery. His son Tim paid for costly experimental medicine and was involved in all decisions. In what would be his last public appearance, McGraw attended the closing ceremonies of Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia on September 28, 2003, where he recreated the final out of the Phillies&#x27; World Series triumph. McGraw died on January 5, 2004, at the home of his son Tim and his wife Faith Hill in Brentwood, Tennessee. The Mets played the 2004 season with the words &quot;Ya Gotta Believe&quot; embroidered on their left shoulders in McGraw&#x27;s honor and the Phillies wore a patch on their right shoulder featuring a shamrock in honor of McGraw and a banner reading &quot;Pope&quot; in honor of longtime Phillies executive Paul Owens, who had also died that winter. His son Tim&#x27;s 2004 hit &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot; (written by Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman) was recorded in his father&#x27;s honor and the music video featured the clip of McGraw recording the final out of the 1980 World Series. The song was number 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts for seven weeks and was named the number 1 country song of 2004 by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

McGraw was cremated after his death. Nearly five years later, his son Tim McGraw spread a handful of his dad&#x27;s ashes on the pitcher&#x27;s mound at the Phillies current home park, Citizens Bank Park, in Game 3 of the 2008 World Series.

In 2023, after six Philadelphia Phillies players died prematurely of glioblastoma, a theory linked the brain cancer to toxic PFAS chemicals in the AstroTurf at Veterans Stadium; however, it cannot be proven definitively.

===Philanthropy===
In 2003, prior to his death, McGraw established The Tug McGraw Foundation to enhance the quality of life of children and adults with brain tumors. In 2009, it expanded programs to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The foundation sponsored a photography class at Camp Pendleton to help 15 marines as part of the recovery process from battlefield wounds.

==Honors and awards==
In 1993, McGraw was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.

In 1999, the Philadelphia Phillies inducted McGraw into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.

In 2004, following his death, the Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America renamed the annual Good Guy Award the Tug McGraw Good Guy Award.

In 2010, McGraw was inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="422212" wikidata="Q735664" url="?curid=422212" title="Skymark Airlines">
<text>() is a Japanese airline headquartered at Haneda Airport in Ōta, Tokyo, Japan. It operates scheduled services with a main base at Haneda Airport with another base at Kobe Airport where it is the dominant carrier. It also operates a base at Naha Airport. It is the only Japanese airline offering regular scheduled services at Ibaraki Airport north of Tokyo.

Skymark was the first low-cost airline established in Japan. Internet entrepreneur Shinichi Nishikubo controlled the company from 2003 to 2015, when the carrier filed for bankruptcy protection after attempting a fleet and service expansion.

In August 2015, Skymark creditors agreed to restructure the airline under the control of Japanese private equity fund Integral Corporation (50.1%), with minority investments from All Nippon Airways (16.5%), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and the Development Bank of Japan (33.4%).

== History ==
=== Low-cost airline operations (1996–2010) ===

Skymark Airlines was founded in November 1996 as an independent domestic airline after deregulation of the Japanese airline industry and started operations on 19 September 1998. It was originally owned by a consortium of investors led by the travel agency H.I.S. and headed by H.I.S. president Hideo Sawada; another major early investor was the leasing company Orix. Its initial business plan called for it to be headquartered at Itami Airport in Osaka. Takashi Ide, former head of British Airways&#x27; operation in Japan, was hired as the company&#x27;s CEO in 1998.

Skymark was able to obtain six slots at Haneda Airport in Tokyo in March 1997 and moved its headquarters to the Hamamatsucho district of Tokyo in March 1998. Its first scheduled flight from Haneda to Fukuoka was on 19 September 1998; it added routes from Itami to Fukuoka and Sapporo in 1999, but suspended these routes in 2000 in order to offer more frequencies on the Haneda-Fukuoka route.

In 2002, Skymark took delivery of a third Boeing 767 aircraft and began service on the Haneda-Kagoshima route, as well as charter service from Haneda to Seoul. In 2003, with a fourth 767 dry-leased (leased without any crew members) from All Nippon Airways, it began service to Aomori and Tokushima.

The airline incurred considerable losses in its first few years of operations. It briefly considered a recapitalization led by Commerzbank but decided not to accept such an investment due to Air Do&#x27;s issues with banks interfering in management. In August 2003, Sawada invited internet entrepreneur Shinichi Nishikubo to become Skymark&#x27;s largest shareholder with a personal cash investment of 3.5 billion yen (having made around 9 billion yen from the IPO of his internet company in 2000). Nishikubo took over as CEO in 2004, maintaining Ide as a &quot;co-pilot&quot; due to Ide&#x27;s experience in the aviation industry.

On 11 December 2003, Skymark announced that it expected a profit of 470 million yen for the half-fiscal year ending on 31 October, the first profit made since the airline began operations. By using more efficient aircraft and systems developed in-house, Skymark attempted to undercut JAL and ANA on costs in order to offer lower fares.

Skymark had a code sharing partnership with Japan Airlines starting with a Haneda-Osaka Kansai service in 2005–06, and later on the Tokyo Haneda-Kobe route from Kobe Airport&#x27;s opening in 2006. JAL withdrew from Kobe in 2010, while Skymark developed Kobe into a secondary base. Skymark purchased the naming rights for the Kobe Sports Park Baseball Stadium from 2005 to 2010.

Skymark announced in April 2010 that it would commence a &quot;Narita Shuttle&quot; service from Narita International Airport to Asahikawa, Sapporo, Fukuoka, and Okinawa in late 2011 and early 2012.

=== Shift to premium service (2010–2014) ===

In November 2010 Skymark announced negotiations with Airbus for an order of four Airbus A380 aircraft and two options, making it the first Japanese airline to order the type. The airline announced its intent to use the aircraft on long-haul trunk routes out of Narita Airport such as London, Frankfurt, Paris and New York, and that they would be operated in a two-class, 394-seat configuration – with 114 seats in business class and 280 in a premium economy class. Nishikubo envisioned an unheard-of fully-flat product in economy class, which the Skymark team calculated would break even at a one-way fare of 100,000 yen.

As Skymark began to prepare for international service, it began to face stiff competition from a new group of low-cost carriers in Japan beginning in 2012, particularly from AirAsia Japan (later Vanilla Air), Peach Aviation, Jetstar Japan and Spring Airlines Japan at its Narita base. This led to a reduction in Skymark&#x27;s frequencies on highly contested routes such as Narita-Sapporo and Narita-Fukuoka, and a refocusing of aircraft on more exclusive routes such as Narita-Ishigaki.

Skymark attempted a more competitive domestic offering by executing leases for seven Airbus A330-300 aircraft in July 2012. Skymark announced that it would outfit these aircraft in a 271-seat single-class premium configuration with 38-inch seat pitch and 22-inch seat width, tentatively called &quot;Green Seats&quot; and comparable to the domestic &quot;Class J&quot; offering on Japan Airlines, to win market share among business travelers on the key domestic trunk routes from Tokyo to Fukuoka and Sapporo. Skymark also had plans to install &quot;Green Seat&quot; cabins on its 737 fleet to create a 2-class configuration but cancelled the plan in early 2014 in favor of keeping a single-class 737 fleet for competition with other LCCs.

Somewhat controversially, Skymark announced that A330 flight attendants would wear miniskirt uniforms, in contrast to Skymark&#x27;s usual polo shirt uniforms, for the first six months of operation of each route. The Japan Federation of Cabin Attendants publicly complained about the idea, claiming that the uniforms were unsafe to the women wearing them and would lead to harassment and objectification.

Starting in 2013, Delta Air Lines was highly interested in starting a codeshare agreement with Skymark, mainly due to Delta&#x27;s expansion of its own Tokyo services. Following ANA&#x27;s investment in Skymark however, the possibility of a codeshare agreement and further partnership with Delta was reduced.

=== Financial downturn and losses (2014–2015) ===
Skymark&#x27;s finances were hit hard by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In February 2011, when Skymark placed its initial A380 order, the Japanese yen was trading at historically high levels of around 82 yen to the U.S. dollar. After the introduction of the Abenomics policy in late 2012, the yen plunged in value, reaching around 102 yen to the dollar in early 2015. Many of Skymark&#x27;s major investments and expenses were denominated in dollars—including the A380 orders, the A330 leases and its fuel costs—while its domestic ticket revenue was in yen, and the airline did not engage in exchange rate hedging. Skymark recorded its first net loss in five years for the March 2013 – 2014 fiscal year.

In early February 2014, Skymark announced that it would downsize the Narita operation to only three destinations (Sapporo, Yonago and Okinawa). Nishikubo stated that the base lost money in every month except August and that all LCCs were under pressure there. He also expressed some reservations about the A330 fleet plan, stating that while the airline had funding in place for the first two aircraft, the third and subsequent deliveries could be impacted by the performance of Skymark&#x27;s domestic operation as well as the success of its initial international service. Skymark planned to re-deploy 737s from the Narita and Haneda bases for charter services to destinations such as Guam.
Airbus completed Skymark&#x27;s first A380 in April 2014 and sent the aircraft to Germany for cabin installation. 
In May, Skymark requested to reschedule a meeting with a European bank involved in financing of its A380 order. Airbus interpreted this as a signal that Skymark sought to renegotiate the contract, and sent a team of financial advisors to Skymark&#x27;s head office in June. After a week of meetings, they proposed an amendment of the A380 purchase agreement, with the condition that if Skymark did not meet a certain revenue target, Nishikubo would be required to sell his shares to an outside investor chosen by Airbus. Nishikubo rejected this proposal in early July, believing there was a significant chance that Skymark would miss the target.

In late July, Airbus announced that it had terminated the airline&#x27;s A380 orders, citing concerns over the airline&#x27;s ability to fund the purchase in light of its poor financial performance. Nishikubo complained the airline was not given the opportunity to revise the contract, but simply received a fax notifying it of the termination. After further negotiations, Airbus sued Skymark for damages in a London court; it was reported that Skymark had already paid Airbus 26.5 billion yen for the aircraft and could face up to 70 billion yen in penalties.
Skymark&#x27;s A330s entered service on the Haneda-Fukuoka route in June 2014, but the additional seat capacity depressed Skymark&#x27;s load factors on the route. Although Skymark&#x27;s 737s were booked to more than 80% of capacity up to May 2014, the much larger A330s were only booked at 67% of capacity as of December 2014, while ANA or JAL achieved similar load factors with much higher-capacity aircraft. In an attempt to raise revenue, Skymark raised advance purchase fares on the route by 23% in October, bringing them closer to the level of JAL and ANA and further harming the competitiveness of the service.

As the Airbus dispute lingered, Skymark pursued new sources of cash. It announced in November 2014 that it was exploring a cooperative relationship with Japan Airlines under which Skymark&#x27;s 36 daily round trips to and from Haneda Airport would be code shared with JAL, subject to approval by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Skymark initially pursued JAL due to a perception that JAL could not threaten Skymark&#x27;s independence; the terms of JAL&#x27;s bankruptcy restructuring prevented it from making an investment in Skymark. However, the Japanese government pressed Skymark to make the codeshare trilateral with both JAL and ANA, reflecting the ruling Liberal Democratic Party&#x27;s preference for ANA. Skymark also attempted a sale and leaseback of over 1 billion yen in equipment as a cash-raising measure, negotiating with a JAL-affiliated trading company and then with an ANA-affiliated trading company. In January 2015, ANA refused to provide financial support to Skymark, and several investment funds also balked at the prospect of injecting cash into the company.

=== Bankruptcy (2015–2016) ===
Skymark filed for bankruptcy protection under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law (equivalent to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States or an administration in the United Kingdom) at the Tokyo District Court in January 2015 after reporting ¥71 billion (or $571.3 million) in liabilities. It announced that Nishikubo would step down as CEO and would be replaced by CFO Masakazu Arimori. Skymark announced that the A330s would be withdrawn from operation in March, and that various services to Okinawa and Kyushu would be eliminated. In an attempt to regain price competitiveness, Skymark introduced a fare of ¥8,000 on the Haneda-Fukuoka route, 1,800 cheaper than the next cheapest competitor, StarFlyer. Skymark was approached by several potential sponsors early in its bankruptcy proceedings, including ANA, AirAsia, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.

Skymark&#x27;s restructuring plan, submitted to the court in May, called for turnaround sponsor Japanese private equity fund Integral to own 50.1% of the recapitalized company, ANA to own 16.5%, and the remainder 33.4% to be owned by an investment fund controlled by government-affiliated Development Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, with Integral providing the new chairman, DBJ providing the new CEO, and code sharing between Skymark and ANA.

Intrepid Aviation and Airbus, who together held around two-thirds of Skymark&#x27;s debt, opposed the plan, and Intrepid submitted a competing plan which called for another (unspecified) airline to sponsor Skymark&#x27;s restructuring. Intrepid reportedly approached several foreign airlines seeking support for this alternative plan.

In the final creditor vote on 6 August 2015, the plan supported by ANA and Integral defeated a competing plan supported by Intrepid and Delta. The Delta plan was initially assumed to be the front runner based on Airbus&#x27;s closer relationship with Delta, but Airbus ultimately switched sides and supported the ANA plan. The &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; reported that ANA made a conditional offer in late July to purchase Airbus aircraft, which Delta did not match by a prescribed midnight deadline, leading Airbus to switch its stance on the restructuring. ANA announced an order for three A380 aircraft in late 2015, which even ANA admitted was not consistent with its overall fleet plan, leading to speculation that ANA had agreed to accept Skymark&#x27;s A380 orders in exchange for Airbus&#x27;s support.

=== Post-bankruptcy (2016–2020) ===
After exiting bankruptcy in 2016, Skymark&#x27;s finances improved more quickly than expected; the company recorded 6.7 billion yen in operating profit in the March 2016 – 2017 fiscal year. Skymark focused its network expansion on its hubs in Kobe and Ibaraki, and announced plans for 150 daily flights in summer 2018, up from 138 in summer 2017.

Skymark announced in June 2018 that it intended to offer international charter flights from Narita to Saipan and Palau, its first international services, with the flights to Saipan subsequently becoming scheduled flights in late 2019.

=== COVID-19 pandemic, second financial losses, recovery (2020–present) ===
Since 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Saipan route was cancelled and was never restored; in late 2022, the CEO of Skymark publicly stated that the airline has no plans to resume scheduled international service before 2026.

In August 2020, the airline announced Shimojishima Airport as a new destination, with flights beginning in October 2020.

In 2021, the first year after effect of COVID-19, Skymarks records ¥27 billion operating losses, become the company&#x27;s worst losses since it exiting from bankruptcy. The airline reported ¥17 billion operating losses once again in 2022.

Skymark was re-listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 2022, after eight years as a privately held company.

In January 2023, Skymark announced firm orders for four Boeing 737 MAX aircraft (two 737 MAX 8 and two 737 MAX 10), as well as options to purchase one of each, and a plan to lease six more MAX 8s. The new aircraft are scheduled to enter service between 2025 and 2027.

=== Fleet development ===

Previously, Skymark operated seven Boeing 767-200 and Boeing 767-300 widebody aircraft between 1998 and 2005. Some 767 fuselages were painted in special &quot;billboard&quot; liveries advertising third-party companies, including Yahoo Japan, Microsoft, J-Phone and USEN Japan. The six 767s acquired by Skymark carried registrations JA767A to JA767F; the seventh, JA8255, was leased from All Nippon Airways from 2003 to 2004.

Under Nishikubo, Skymark began acquiring new Boeing 737-800 narrowbody aircraft in 2005 and eventually retired the 767 from its fleet in 2009.

Skymark ceased flying the A330 and most of the 737s during its bankruptcy in 2015. All A380 orders from Skymark were rescinded as well, although All Nippon Airways proceeded to take three of the five original orders. The two remaining Skymark A380s that were placed into long-term storage following their production were taken up by Emirates.

== Frequent flyer program ==
Skymark planned to introduce a frequent-flyer program in January 2014 to coincide with the launch of its premium domestic service, though the induction of the program was delayed in December 2013 in order to focus on preparing for international service, before being postponed indefinitely. While the airline does not retain its own frequent-flyer program, Skymark has provided award seats to members of the Delta Air Lines SkyMiles program since June 2011, although the two airlines do not codeshare, nor can Skymark flights be used to accrue under Delta&#x27;s SkyMiles program.

<text>The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Komunistická strana Československa&quot;, KSČ) was a communist and Marxist–Leninist political party in Czechoslovakia that existed between 1921 and 1992. It was a member of the Comintern. Between 1929 and 1953, it was led by Klement Gottwald. The KSČ was the sole governing party in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic though it was a leading party along with the Slovak branch and four other legally permitted non-communist parties. After its election victory in 1946, it seized power in the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état and established a one-party state allied with the Soviet Union. Nationalization of virtually all private enterprises followed, and a command economy was implemented.

The KSČ was committed to the pursuit of communism, and after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rise to power Marxism–Leninism became formalized as the party&#x27;s guiding ideology and would remain so throughout the rest of its existence. Consequently, party organisation was based on Bolshevik-like democratic centralism; its highest body was the Party Congress, which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo. The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary, Premier or head of state, or some of the three offices concurrently, but never all three at the same time.

In 1968, party leader Alexander Dubček proposed reforms that included a democratic process and initiated the Prague Spring, leading to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union. Under pressure from the Kremlin, all reforms were repealed, party leadership became taken over by its more authoritarian wing, and a massive non-bloody purge of party members was conducted. In 1989, however, the party leadership bowed to popular pressure during the Velvet Revolution and agreed to call the first contested election since 1946, leading to the victory of the centre-based Civic Forum in the 1990 election and the KSČ stepping down. That November, the party became a federation of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the Communist Party of Slovakia. It was then declared to be a criminal organisation in the Czech Republic by the 1993 Act on Illegality of the Communist Regime and on Resistance Against It.

== History ==

=== 1921–1945 ===
The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was founded at the congress of the Czechoslovak Social-Democratic Party (Left), held in Prague May 14–16, 1921. &quot;Rudé právo&quot;, previously the organ of the Left Social-Democrats, became the main organ of the new party. As a first chairman was elected Václav Šturc, first vice-chairman was Bohumír Šmeral and second vice-chairman was Vaclav Bolen. The party was one of some twenty political parties that competed within the democratic framework of the First Czechoslovak Republic, but it was never in government. In 1925 parliamentary election the party gained 934,223 votes (13.2%, 2nd place) and 41 seats.

The party was the Czechoslovak section of the Communist International. As of 1928 the party was the second-largest section of the International, with an estimated membership of around 138,000, more than twice the membership of the French Communist Party and nearly five times the membership of the Chinese Communist Party at the time.
In 1929 Klement Gottwald became party Secretary-General after the purging from it of various oppositional elements some of whom allied themselves to Trotsky and the International Left Opposition. In 1929 parliamentary election the party gained 753,220 votes (10.2%, 4th place) and 30 seats. In 1935 parliamentary election the party held its 30 seats with 849,495 votes (10.3%, 4th place).

The party was banned on 20 October 1938 during the Second Republic, but continued to exist as an 
underground organisation. Following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, anti-German protests broke out in Prague in October 1939. In response, the Comintern ordered the party to oppose the protests, which they blamed on
&quot;chauvinist elements&quot;.

During World War II many KSČ leaders sought refuge in the Soviet Union, where they prepared to broaden the party&#x27;s power base once the war ended. In the early postwar period the Soviet-supported Czechoslovak communists launched a sustained drive that culminated in their seizure of power in 1948. Once in control, KSČ developed an organizational structure and mode of rule patterned closely after those of CPSU.

=== 1945–1969 ===

The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was in a coalition government from 1945 to 1948. After the war the party grew rapidly, reaching one million members by the time of the 1946 elections: at these elections it became the largest party in Parliament, and party chairman Klement Gottwald became prime minister in a free election.

Following the Communist coup d&#x27;état of 1948, when free elections and other political freedoms were effectively abolished, power was formally held by the National Front, a coalition in which the KSČ held two-thirds of the seats while the remaining one-third were shared among five other political parties. However, KSČ held a &quot;de facto&quot; absolute monopoly on political power, and the other parties within the National Front were little more than auxiliaries. Even the governmental structure of Czechoslovakia existed primarily to implement policy decisions made within the KSČ.

A dispute broke out between Gottwald and the second most-powerful man in the country, party General Secretary Rudolf Slánský, over the extent to which Czechoslovakia should conform with the Soviet model. In 1951, Slánský and several other senior Communists were arrested and charged with participating in a &quot;Trotskyite–Titoite–Zionist conspiracy&quot;. They were subjected to a show trial in 1952 (the Prague Trials) and Slánský and 10 other defendants were executed.

In the early 1960s, Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn, and in 1968, the KSČ was taken over by reformers led by Alexander Dubček. He started a period of liberalization known as the Prague Spring in which he attempted to implement &quot;socialism with a human face&quot;.

The Soviet Union believed the process of liberalization would end state socialism in the country and on 21 August 1968, Warsaw Pact forces invaded. Subsequently, the Soviet justification for the invasion would become known as the Brezhnev Doctrine.

=== 1969–1992 ===
In April 1969, Dubček was removed as party General Secretary (replaced by Gustáv Husák) and expelled in 1970. During the period of normalization that followed, the party was dominated by two factions: moderates and hardliners.

==== Moderates and pragmatists ====
Moderates and pragmatists were represented by Gustáv Husák who led the neo-stalinist wing of KSČ leadership. As a moderate or pragmatic, he was pressed by hardliners, most notably Vasil Biľak. An important Slovak Communist Party functionary from 1943 to 1950, Husák was arrested in 1951 and sentenced to three years, later increased to life imprisonment, for &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot; during the Stalinist purges of the era. Released in 1960 and rehabilitated in 1963, Husák refused any political position in Antonín Novotný&#x27;s régime but after Novotný&#x27;s fall he became deputy prime minister during the Prague Spring. After Dubček&#x27;s resignation Husák was named KSČ First Secretary in April 1969 and president of the republic in July 1975. Above all, Husák was a survivor who learned to accommodate the powerful political forces surrounding him and he denounced Dubček after 1969.

Other prominent moderates/pragmatics who were still in power by 1987 included:
*Lubomír Štrougal, Premier of Czechoslovakia;
*Peter Colotka, Premier of the Slovak Socialist Republic;
*Jozef Lenárt, First Secretary of the KSS;
*Josef Kempný, Chairman of the Czech National Council.
These leaders generally supported the reforms instituted under Dubček during the late 1960s but successfully made the transition to orthodox party rule following the invasion and Dubček&#x27;s decline from power. Subsequently, they adopted a more flexible stance regarding economic reform and dissident activity.

====Hardliners ====
Key members of this faction included:

*Vasiľ Biľak, their leader, was a Rusyn from Eastern Slovakia who had been member of the Presidium since 1968 and was chairman of the party&#x27;s Ideological Commission
*Karel Hoffman, a Central Committee Secretary and Presidium member;
*Antonín Kapek, Presidium member;
*Jan Fojtík, Secretary;
*Alois Indra, Presidium member and Chairman of the Federal Assembly (replaced the National Assembly under 1968 federation law); and
*Miloš Jakeš, Chairman of the Central Supervisory and Auditing Commission and Presidium member (replaced Gustáv Husák as the Party&#x27;s General Secretary in 1987).

These hardliners opposed economic and political reforms and took a harsh stand on dissent.

The party&#x27;s hegemony ended with the Velvet Revolution in 1989. In November, Jakeš and the entire Presidium resigned. Jakeš was succeeded by Karel Urbanek, who only held power for about a month before the party formally abandoned power in December. Later that month, Husák, who retained the presidency after standing down as general secretary, was forced to swear in the country&#x27;s first non-Communist government in 41 years.

====Federal party and dissolution====
At the 18th party congress held November 3–4, 1990, the party was rebaptized as KSČS and became a federation of two parties: the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM) and the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS). Pavol Kanis served as the chairman of the Federal Council of KSČS. However, the two constituent organizations of the federal party were moving in different directions politically and there was great tension between them. KSS, the Slovak constituent party of KSČS, was renamed as Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) on January 26, 1991. Whilst no longer a communist party per se, SDL formally remained as the Slovak constituent party of KSČS.

In August 1991, upon the request of SDL, the party mutated into the Federation of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the Party of the Democratic Left (&quot;Federácie KSČM a SDĽ&quot;). KSČM unsuccessfully appealed to two Slovak communist splinter parties, the Communist Party of Slovakia – 91 (KSS &#x27;91) and the Union of Communists of Slovakia (ZKS), to join the Federation. At the first SDL congress in December 1991, SDL formally withdrew from the Federation with the KSČM. The Federation was formally declared dissolved in April 1992.

=== Claimed reformation ===
On 10 March 1995 a party named Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was registered as a political party in the Czech Republic and on the 22 April 1995 Miroslav Štěpán was elected its General Secretary. The party claimed to be the heir to KSČ and rejected the claims of KSČM on the basis of their revisionist positions. The majority of remaining communists rejected their claim to represent the old party and continued their political career as members of KSČM. In 1999 the party changed its name to The Party of Czech Communists (SČK). Their official page is http://www.ksc.cz/ and still uses the old acronym.

In 2001 the party underwent its first split, when a part of it split off to form the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia – Czechoslovak Labour Party (KSČ-ČSSP) led by Ludvík Zifčák, a former member of the National Police, who infiltrated the student protesters during the Velvet Revolution. The false story that a student named Martin Šmíd was killed by the state police was likely aided by the demonstrators confusing memories of him with a dead body of a student, because he was accidentally struck by his colleagues and blacked out.

After Štěpán died in 2014 and was replaced as General Secretary by Jiří Vábr, the party had another split. Vojtěch Mišičák accused the party of passivity and broke off a new group called the Czech Communist Party 21 (KSČ21), whose current general secretary is Zdeněk Klímek.

None of these parties ever had any electoral successes on the rare occasion they even ran candidates. Štěpán was a candidate in the 1996 and 1998 Czech Senate election for Bruntál. In 1996 he came fifth with 627 votes and the KSČM candidate Rostislav Harazin came 3rd with 5 294 votes. In 1998 he came seventh with 716 votes and Harazin won with 7 852 votes in the first round and 10 154 in the second.

== Organisation ==
===National===
KSČ organization was based on the Leninist concept of democratic centralism, which provided for the election of party leaders at all levels but required that each level be fully subject to the control of the next higher unit. Accordingly, party programs and policies were directed from the top, and resolutions of higher organs were unconditionally binding on all lower organs and individual party members. In theory, policy matters were freely and openly discussed at congresses, conferences, membership meetings, and in the party press. In practice, however, these discussions merely reflected decisions made by a small contingent of top party officials.

The supreme KSČ organ was the party congress, which normally convened every five years for a session lasting less than one week. An exception was made with respect to the 14th Party Congress, which was held in August 1968 under Dubček&#x27;s leadership. Held in semi-secrecy in a tractor factory in the opening days of the Soviet occupation, this congress denounced the invasion, and was later declared illegal, its proceedings stricken from party records, and a second, &quot;legal&quot; 14th Party Congress held in May 1971. Subsequent numbered congresses were held in April 1976, April 1981 and March 1986. Party congress theoretically was responsible for making basic policy decisions; in practice, however, it was the Presidium of the Central Committee that held the decision-making and policy-making responsibilities. The congress merely endorsed the reports and directives of the top party leadership. The statutory duties assigned the party congress included determination of the party&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies; approval of the party program and statutes; and election of the Central Committee and the Central Supervisory and Auditing Commission, as well as discussion and approval of their reports.

Between congresses, KSČ&#x27;s Central Committee (CC) was responsible for directing party activities and implementing general policy decisions. Party statutes also provided that CC functioned as the primary arm of KSČ control over the organs of federal government and the republics, National Front, and all cultural and professional organizations. Party members holding leading positions in these bodies were responsible directly to CC for the implementation of KSČ policies. In addition, CC screened nominations for all important government and party positions and selected the editor-in-chief of &quot;Rudé právo&quot;, the principal party newspaper. CC generally met in full session at least twice a year. In 1976, CC had 115 members and 45 candidates; in 1986, these figures were 135 and 62, respectively. In terms of composition, CC normally included leading party and government officials, military officials, and some celebrities.

CC, like the party congress, rarely acted as more than a rubber stamp of policy decisions made by KSČ&#x27;s Presidium, except when factional infighting developed within the Presidium in 1968 and CC assumed crucial importance in resolving the dispute to oust First Secretary Novotný in favour of Dubček. Generally, decisions on which CC voted were reached beforehand so that votes taken at the sessions were unanimous. The Presidium, which conducted party work between full committee sessions, formally was elected by the CC; in reality, top party leaders determined its composition. In 1986, there were 11 full members and 6 candidate members.

CC&#x27;s Secretariat acted as the party&#x27;s highest administrative authority and as the nerve centre of the party&#x27;s extensive control mechanism. The Secretariat supervised implementation of decisions made in the Presidium, controlled any movement up and down the party ladder, and directed work within the party and government apparatus. Under Husák, composition of the Secretariat, like that of the Presidium, remained rather constant. Many secretaries were also members of the Presidium.

The Central Supervisory and Auditing Commission played a dual role, overseeing party discipline and supervising party finances, but it did not control anything. As an organ for enforcement of party standards, Central Supervisory and Auditing Commission frequently wielded its power to suspend or expel &quot;deviant&quot; party members. It was this commission that directed the massive purges in party membership during the early and late 1970s. Members were elected at each party congress (45 members in 1986). These members then elected from among themselves a chairman, deputy chairmen, and a small presidium. Sub-units of the commission existed at the republic, regional and district levels of the party structure.

Other KSČ commissions in 1987 included People&#x27;s Supervisory Commission, Agriculture and Food Commission, Economic Commission, Ideological Commission, and Youth Commission.

In 1987 the party also had 18 departments (agitation and propaganda; agriculture, food industry, forestry and water management; Comecon cooperation; culture; economic administration; economics; education and science; elected state organs; external economic relations; fuels and energy; industry; transport and communications; international affairs; mass media; political organisation; science and technology; social organisations and national committees; state administration; and a general department). In most instances the party departments paralleled agencies and ministries of the government and supervised their activities to ensure conformity with KSČ norms and programmes.

Also under CC supervision were two party training centres: the Advanced School of Politics and the Institute of Marxism–Leninism (see below).

===Republic level===
Down on republic level party structure deviated from the government organisation in that a separate communist party unit existed in the Slovak Socialist Republic (see Communist Party of Slovakia) but not in the Czech Socialist Republic. KSS emerged from World War II as a party distinct from KSČ, but the two were united after the communist takeover in 1948. The reformer movement of the 1960s advocated a return to a system of autonomous parties for the two republics. Bureau for the Conduct of Party Work in the Czech Lands was created as a counterpart to KSS, but it was suppressed after the 1968 invasion and by 1971 had been stricken from party records.

=== Regional level ===
KSČ had ten regional subdivisions (seven in the Czech lands, three in Slovakia) identical to &quot;kraje&quot;, the ten major governmental administrative divisions. In addition, however, the Prague and Bratislava municipal party organs, because of their size, were given regional status within KSČ. Regional conferences selected regional committees, which in turn selected a leading secretary, a number of secretaries and a regional Supervisory and Auditing Commission.

Regional units were broken down into a total of 114 district-level (Czech: &quot;okresní&quot;) organisations. District conferences were held simultaneously every two to three years, at which time each conference selected a district committee that subsequently selected a secretariat to be headed by a district secretary.

=== Local level ===
At local level, KSČ was structured according to what it called &quot;territorial and production principle&quot;; basic party units were organised in work sites and residences where there are at least five KSČ members. In enterprises or communities where party membership was more numerous, smaller units functioned under larger city-, village- or factory-wide committees. Highest authority of the local organisation was, theoretically, the monthly membership meeting, attendance at which was a basic duty of every member. Each group selected its own leadership, consisting of a chairman and one or more secretaries. It also named delegates to the conference of the next higher unit, be it at municipal (like in case of larger cities) or district level.

==Membership==

Since assuming power in 1948, KSČ had one of the largest per capita membership rolls in the communist world (11 percent of the entire population). The membership roll was often alleged by party ideologues to contain a large component of inactive, opportunistic, and &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; elements. These charges were used on two occasions, between 1948 and 1950 and again from 1969 to 1971, as a pretext to conduct massive purges of the membership. In the first case, during the great Stalinist purges, nearly one million members were removed; in the wake of the Prague Spring and subsequent invasion, about half that number either resigned or were purged from KSČ.

Purges following the 1968 invasion hit especially the Czechs, the youth and the blue-collar workers, as well as the intelligentsia within the party membership. By the end of 1970, KSČ had lost approx. 27.8% of its members compared to January 1968 figures as a result of forced removal or voluntary resignation. Despite this attrition, a membership of &quot;almost 1,200,000&quot; was claimed in the spring of 1971 for a country with an estimated population of approx. 14.5 million – still one of the highest Communist party membership rates in the world on a percentage basis at that time. Owing to this membership decline, accelerated recruitment efforts were targeted at youth and factory workers for the rest of the 1970s.

The party&#x27;s membership efforts in the 1980s focused on recruiting politically and professionally qualified people willing to exercise greater activism in implementing the party&#x27;s program. Party leaders at the 17th Party Congress (1986) urged recruitment of more workers, young people, and women. In 1981 it had 1,538,179 members (10% of the population)

KSČ membership was contingent upon completion of a one-year period as a candidate member. Candidate members could not vote or be elected to party committees. In addition to candidates for party membership, there were also candidates for party leadership groups from the local levels to the Presidium. These candidates, already party members, were considered interns training for the future assumption of particular leadership responsibilities.

===Training of members===
Indoctrination and training of party members was one of the basic responsibilities of regional and district organizations, and party training was mostly conducted on these levels. Regional and district units worked with local party organizations in setting up training programs and determining which members would be enrolled in particular courses of study. On the whole, the system of party schooling changed little since it was established in 1949. A district or city organization provided weekly classes in the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, history of communism, socialist economics, and current party position on domestic and international affairs.

Members training for positions as party functionaries attended seminars at schools for Marxism–Leninism set up in local areas or at more advanced institutes for Marxism–Leninism found in Prague, Brno and Bratislava. The highest level of party training was offered at the Advanced School of Politics in Prague. Designed to train the top echelon of party leadership, the three-year curriculum had the official status of a university program and was said to be one of the best programs in political science in Eastern Europe. These institutions were under the direction of KSČ Central Committee.

===Membership demographics===

Because of KSČ&#x27;s mandate to be a workers&#x27; party, questions about social background of party members took on a particular salience. KSČ was often reticent with precise details about its members, and the question of how many in the party actually belonged to the revolutionary proletariat proper became a delicate one. Official statements appeared to overstate the percentage of workers within the party&#x27;s ranks. Nonetheless, a number of trends were clear. The proportion of workers in KSČ was at its highest (approximately 60% of total membership) after World War II but before the party took power in 1948. After that time, percentage of workers fell steadily to a low of an estimated one-quarter of the membership in 1970.

In the early 1970s, government media decried the &quot;grave imbalance&quot;, noting that &quot;[the] present class and social structure of party membership is not in conformity with the party&#x27;s role as a vanguard for the working class.&quot; In highly industrialized central Bohemia, for example, only 1 in every 35 workers was party member, while 1 in every 5 administrators was. In 1976, after intensive efforts to recruit workers, number of workers rose to one-third of the KSČ membership, i.e., approx. its 1962 level. In the 1980s, driven by a need for &quot;intensive&quot; economic development, the party relaxed its rigid rule about young workers&#x27; priority in admissions and allowed district and regional committees to be flexible in their recruitment policy, as long as the overall proportion of workers did not decrease.

Average age of party members showed a comparable trend. In the late 1960s, fewer than 30% of party members were under 35 years of age, nearly 20% were over 60, and roughly half were 45 or older. The quip in 1971, a half-century after the party&#x27;s founding in Czechoslovakia, was &quot;After fifty years, a party of fifty-year-olds.&quot; There was a determined effort to attract younger members to the party in the middle to late 1970s; one strategy was to recruit children of parents who were KSČ members. The party sent letters to the youngsters&#x27; schools and their parents&#x27; employers, encouraging the children to join. By early 1980 approximately one-third of KSČ members were 35 years of age or younger. In 1983, average age of the &quot;leading cadre&quot; was still estimated at 50.

=== Lack of party loyalty in the 1970s and 1980s ===
Throughout the 1970s and 80s, government media denounced party members&#x27; lack of devotion to the pursuit of KSČ policies and goals. Complaints ranged from members&#x27; refusal to display flags from their apartment windows on festive occasions to their failure to show up for party work brigades, attend meetings, or pay dues; a significant minority of members tended to underreport their incomes (the basis for assessing dues). In 1970, after a purge of approximately one-third of the membership, an average of less than half the remaining members attended meetings. Perhaps one-third of members were consistently recalcitrant in participating in KSČ activities. In 1983, one primary party branch in the Prague-West district was so unmoved by admonishments that it had to be disbanded and its members dispersed among other organizations. In part, this was a measure of disaffection with Czechoslovakia&#x27;s thoroughgoing subservience to Soviet hegemony, a Švejkian response to the lack of political and economic autonomy. It was also a reflection of the purge&#x27;s targets. Those expelled were often the ideologically motivated, the ones for whom developing socialism with a human face represented a significant goal; those who were simply opportunistic survived the purges more easily.

<text>Daniel Gillespie Clowes (; born April 14, 1961) is an American cartoonist, graphic novelist, illustrator, and screenwriter. Most of Clowes&#x27;s work first appeared in &quot;Eightball&quot;, a solo anthology comic book series. An &quot;Eightball&quot; issue typically contained several short pieces and a chapter of a longer narrative that was later collected and published as a graphic novel, such as &quot;Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron&quot; (1993), &quot;Ghost World&quot; (1997), &quot;David Boring&quot; (2000) and &quot;Patience&quot; (2016). Clowes&#x27;s illustrations have appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and elsewhere. With filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, Clowes adapted &quot;Ghost World&quot; into a 2001 film and another &quot;Eightball&quot; story into the 2006 film, &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;. Clowes&#x27;s comics, graphic novels, and films have received numerous awards, including a Pen Award for Outstanding Work in Graphic Literature, over a dozen Harvey and Eisner Awards, and an Academy Award nomination.

==Early life and career, 1961–1988==

Clowes was born in Chicago, Illinois, to an auto mechanic mother and a furniture craftsman father. His mother was Jewish, whereas his father was from a &quot;reserved WASPish Pennsylvania&quot; family; Clowes&#x27;s upbringing was not religious. In 1979, he finished high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, where he earned a BFA in 1984. It was at Pratt that he met and befriended fellow cartoonist Rick Altergott, with whom he started the small-press comics publisher Look Mom Comics.

According to Clowes scholar Ken Parille, the cartoonist had an early response to a &quot;graphic&quot; comic when, at age four, he burst into tears and began hitting his head against a wall after seeing a cover of a &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; comic book that depicted a family dying of heat. Later, he received &quot;piles of 1950s and 1960s classic titles like &quot;Archie&quot; and &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;&quot; from his older brother, who also introduced him to the work of legendary cartoonist R. Crumb.

Clowes&#x27;s first professional work appeared in 1985 in &quot;Cracked&quot;, and he contributed to the magazine until 1989, working under a variety of pseudonyms, most prominently &quot;Stosh Gillespie&quot;, and, toward the end of his tenure, under his own name. Clowes and writer Mort Todd co-created a recurring &quot;Cracked&quot; feature titled &quot;The Uggly Family&quot;. In 1985, Clowes drew the first comic to feature his character Lloyd Llewellyn. He sent the story to Fantagraphics&#x27; Gary Groth, and his work soon appeared in the Hernandez brothers&#x27; &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; #13. Fantagraphics published six magazine-sized, black and white issues of &quot;Lloyd Llewellyn&quot; in 1986 and 1987, another story was published as a Back-up story in the reprint book Doomsday Squad (1986) and &quot;The All-New Lloyd Llewellyn&quot;, the final Llewellyn comic book, appeared in 1988.

==&quot;Eightball&quot;, 1989–2004==
In 1989, Fantagraphics published the first issue of Clowes&#x27;s comic book &quot;Eightball.&quot; On issue #1&#x27;s masthead, Clowes described the anthology as &quot;An Orgy of Spite, Vengeance, Hopelessness, Despair, and Sexual Perversiona&quot;. &quot;Eightball&quot; lasted twenty three issues, ending in 2004. One of the most widely acclaimed American alternative comics, it won over two dozen awards, and all of Clowes&#x27;s &quot;Eightball&quot; serials have been collected and released as graphic novels.

From #1 to #18, an &quot;Eightball&quot; issue typically contained short pieces that ranged in genre from comical rant and Freudian analysis to fairy tale and cultural criticism. These issues also featured a chapter of a serial that Clowes later collected as a graphic novel: &quot;Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron&quot; (1993), &quot;Pussey!&quot; (1995), and &quot;Ghost World&quot; (1997). With #19, Clowes abandoned the anthology format. The oversized black and white issues #19–21 each contained a single act of Clowes&#x27;s three-act &quot;David Boring&quot;, which was released as a graphic novel in 2000. Clowes again changed format with #22. The first full-color &quot;Eightball&quot;, #22 included a single graphic novel-length story &quot;Ice Haven.&quot; The final issue, #23 was a full-color, single-story comic &quot;The Death-Ray&quot; released in 2004.

During the early 1990s, Clowes was associated with Seattle label Sub Pop, creating artwork for recordings by Thee Headcoats, The Supersuckers, The John Peel Sessions, and The Sub Pop Video Program collection. He designed the label&#x27;s mascot, Punky, who appeared on T-shirts, paddle-balls, watches, and other merchandise. In 1994, Clowes created art for the Ramones video &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;.

==Post-&quot;Eightball,&quot; 2005–2023==

After &quot;Eightball&quot; ended in 2004, Clowes began to release full-color graphic novels, beginning in 2005 with &quot;Ice Haven,&quot; a revised version of the comic that appeared in &quot;Eightball&quot; #22. In 2010 Drawn and Quarterly published &quot;Wilson,&quot; Clowes&#x27;s first graphic novel that had not been serialized in &quot;Eightball.&quot; The next year, Pantheon released &quot;Mister Wonderful,&quot; a revised and reformatted version of a narrative serialized weekly in 2007 and 2008 in &quot;The Sunday New York Times Magazine&quot;, a story Clowes described as a &quot;romance.&quot; 2011 also saw the Drawn and Quarterly hardcover release of &quot;The Death-Ray&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;Eightball&quot; #23.

During this period, Clowes drew the first of several &quot;New Yorker&quot; covers and contributed comics to Zadie Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Other People&quot; (2008) and the influential art comics anthology &quot;Kramers Ergot&quot; (#7, 2008). In 2006, after a health crisis, Clowes underwent open-heart surgery. His longest graphic novel &quot;Patience&quot; was released in the US in March 2016. His latest graphic novel &quot;Monica&quot; was released on October 3, 2023, by Fantagraphics. Clowes lives in Oakland, California, with his wife Erika and his child.

==Cultural contexts==
Clowes&#x27;s work emerged from the late-1980s and early-1990s American alternative comics scene and played an important role in comics achieving a new level of respect from reviewers, academics, and readers. &quot;Ghost World&quot; was among the earliest American &quot;literary&quot; comics to be marketed and sold through conventional book stores as a graphic novel. (Clowes has been critical of the terms &quot;literary comics&quot; and &quot;graphic novel.&quot;) It was presented in serial form within &quot;Eightball&quot; #11‐#18 (1993‐1997).

Some of his most popular stories, such as &quot;Ghost World&quot; and &quot;The Party&quot;, are associated with Generation X (&quot;The Party&quot; was reprinted in Douglas Rushkoff&#x27;s 1994 &quot;GenX Reader&quot;). This movement&#x27;s investment in post-adolescent aimlessness was one of Clowes&#x27;s main themes during the 1990s. The cartoonist led the way for comic artists like Adrian Tomine and Craig Thompson, who also focused on the angst of post-adolescent characters.

Like filmmaker David Lynch, Clowes is known for mixing elements of kitsch and the grotesque. Reflecting the cartoonist&#x27;s interest in 1950s and 1960s TV, film, mainstream and underground comics, and &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, these elements surface in Clowes&#x27;s 1990s work, especially his graphic novel &quot;Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron.&quot; During the 1990s, the juxtaposition of kitsch and horror became something of a zeitgeist in visual art, independent film, and post-underground comics.

Clowes&#x27;s post-2000 graphic novels marked a shift in subject matter and form. &quot;Ice Haven&quot;, &quot;The Death-Ray&quot;, &quot;Wilson&quot;, and &quot;Mister Wonderful&quot; featured older protagonists and explored issues of masculinity and aging. Like the work of his fellow cartoonists Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman, these comics displayed an interest in American comic-strip history, using layouts, coloring, and drawing styles reminiscent of newspaper cartoons, especially the large early- and mid-20th-century Sunday comic strips.

==Awards==
Clowes has received dozens of awards and nominations for his comics and film work. In 2002, he was nominated for several awards for the &quot;Ghost World&quot; film, including an Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Published, an AFI Award for Screenwriter of the Year, a Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay, and others.

For his comics, Clowes has won many Harvey Awards, including Best Writer in 1997 and 2005; Best Series in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1997; Best Letter in 1991 and 1997; Best Single Issue or Story in 1990, 1991, 1998 and 2005; and Best Cartoonist in 2002. He has won numerous Eisner Awards, including Best Writer/Artist: Drama in 2000 and 2002; Best Single Issue/Single Story in 2002 and 2005; Best Short Story in 2008; Best New Graphic Album in 2011. In 2011, he won a Pen Award for Outstanding Body of Work in Graphic Literature.

Clowes was awarded the Inkpot Award in 2006.

Clowes received the prestigious Fauve d&#x27;Or for his album &quot;Monica&quot; at the 51e Édition of the &quot;Festival de la BD d&#x27;Angoulême&quot; in January 2024.

==Exhibitions==
Clowes&#x27;s original art has appeared in American group shows as well as exhibitions in Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, and elsewhere. His first solo show was held at Los Angeles&#x27;s Richard Heller Gallery in 2003. In 2012, Susan Miller curated his first museum retrospective, &quot;Modern Cartoonist: The Art of Daniel Clowes&quot; at the Oakland Museum of California. It featured 100 works, including pencil and ink drawings, color pencil illustrations, and gouache art, with covers for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; &quot;Eightball&quot; issues, and Clowes&#x27;s graphic novels. The show traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2013, and is at the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio, in mid-2014. It may continue on to Europe and Asia.

==Screenwriting==
In the late 1990s, Clowes began a career as a screenwriter. His first film was 2001&#x27;s &quot;Ghost World&quot;. Based on Clowes&#x27;s comic of the same name and written with director Terry Zwigoff, the film is set in a nondescript American town and follows the misadventures of two best friends, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), who detest most of their high school classmates. After graduation they plan on moving in together and avoiding college, but they grow apart as adult pressures take their toll. The girls play a prank on a nerdy record collector named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who quickly becomes Enid&#x27;s unlikely friend and confidante, as her relationship with Rebecca deteriorates. Nominated for a host of awards, most notably a 2002 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie appeared on many 2001 &quot;Best of&quot; lists. In 2001, Fantagraphics published &quot;Ghost Word: A Screenplay. &quot;

Clowes&#x27;s second film &quot;Art School Confidential&quot; was based on the cartoonist&#x27;s experiences at Pratt Institute in the early 1980s. (Clowes&#x27;s four-page comic &quot;Art School Confidential&quot; covered some of the same experiences.) Directed by Zwigoff with a script by Clowes, the film follows Jerome (Max Minghella), an art student who dreams of becoming the world&#x27;s greatest artist. The film was not as well received as &quot;Ghost World&quot;. In 2006, Fantagraphics published &quot;Art School Confidential: A Screenplay&quot;. A third adaptation of a Clowes graphic novel, &quot;Wilson&quot;, directed by Craig Johnson, starring Woody Harrelson, and with Clowes writing the screenplay, was released in 2017.

At least four other film projects have been discussed or partially developed, with one being abandoned and two remaining in limbo for over seven years. Clowes and director Michel Gondry discussed making a film based on Rudy Rucker&#x27;s novel &quot;Master of Space and Time&quot;, with Clowes writing and Gondry directing, but the project never advanced beyond this stage; of the film Clowes said, &quot;I actually announced that that wasn&#x27;t going to be made at the 2006 San Diego [Comic] Con.&quot; In 2006, Clowes began writing a script based on his comic &quot;The Death-Ray&quot; for a movie to be produced by Jack Black&#x27;s Black and White Productions. Clowes also wrote a screenplay based on the true story of three boys who, over the course of seven years, filmed a shot-for-shot remake of &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. , neither &quot;The Death-Ray&quot; nor the &quot;Raiders&quot; project has been greenlit. In 2016, it was announced Clowes will adapt his graphic novel &quot;Patience&quot; for Focus Features. the project remains in development.

==Plagiarism by Shia LaBeouf==
In December 2013, Shia LaBeouf&#x27;s short film &quot;Howard Cantour.com&quot; became available online. Soon thereafter, those familiar with indie comics noticed its remarkable resemblance to &quot;Justin M. Damiano,&quot; a comic Clowes contributed to the 2008 charity anthology &quot;The Book of Other People&quot;. The short film was then removed by LaBeouf, who claimed that he was not &quot;copying&quot; Clowes, but rather was &quot;inspired&quot; by him and &quot;got lost in the creative process.&quot; LaBeouf later issued several apologies on Twitter, writing, &quot;In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation&quot;, and &quot;I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work.&quot; Clowes responded by saying &quot;The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I&#x27;ve never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can&#x27;t imagine what was going through his mind.&quot;

Legal representatives of Clowes also sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf concerning another tweet stating he intended to make a second film plagiarizing Clowes.

==OK Soda==
In 1993 and 1994, Clowes created artwork for Coca-Cola&#x27;s Generation X-inspired beverage OK Soda, which was test-marketed in select American cities in 1994 and 1995 before being discontinued. His art appeared on cans, bottles, twelve-pack cases, posters, vending machines, and other merchandise, along with point-of sale display items. Clowes&#x27;s art appears on two cans/bottles (the face of a young man looking forward; the face of a young woman looking forward), though he is often incorrectly credited for other OK can art.

== Illustrations ==
Clowes has illustrated over 25 LP, EP, and CD covers, including &quot;Everything Looks Better in the Dark&quot; (1987) by Frank French and Kevn Kinney, Thee Headcoats&#x27; &quot;Heavens to Murgatroyd, Even! It&#x27;s Thee Headcoats! (Already)&quot;, and the Supersuckers album &quot;The Smoke of Hell&quot; (1992). His artwork can be seen in the Ramones video for their Tom Waits cover &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; (1994).

His art appeared on a skateboard deck for Santa Cruz Skateboards (1991 – it was reissued in black and white in 2006).

Clowes drew covers and booklet art for the Criterion Collection&#x27;s releases of Samuel Fuller&#x27;s films &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; and &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; (2011). An OK Soda vending machine with Clowes art appears in several shots in Christopher Guest&#x27;s mockumentary &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; (1997). He created the movie poster for Todd Solondz&#x27;s film &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998).

He drew the key art for Season 4 of the HBO series &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; (2017) and the cover for &quot;Encounter Briefs&quot;, a fictional comic book featured in Greg Mottola&#x27;s film &quot;Paul&quot; (2011).

<text>20/20 (stylized as 2020) is an American television newsmagazine that has been broadcast on ABC since June 6, 1978. Created by ABC News executive Roone Arledge, the program was designed similarly to CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in that it features in-depth story packages, although it focuses more on human interest stories than international and political subjects. The program&#x27;s name derives from the &quot;20/20&quot; measurement of visual acuity.

The two-hour-long program has been a staple on Friday evenings (currently airing at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time Zone) for much of the time since it moved to that timeslot from Thursdays in September 1987, though special editions of the program occasionally air on other nights. For most of its history, it was led into by ABC&#x27;s two-hour &quot;TGIF&quot; block of sitcoms.

Since 2019, it has shifted to a two-hour format highlighting true crime stories and celebrity scandals rather than the traditional investigative journalism associated with newsmagazines, following the same programming direction as CBS&#x27;s &quot;48 Hours&quot; and same-night competitor &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;. Special edition episodes, however, cover a wide range of topics.

==History==
The anchors on the premiere telecast of &quot;20/20&quot; were &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine editor Harold Hayes, who also served as the program&#x27;s senior producer, and &quot;Time&quot; art critic Robert Hughes. The program&#x27;s debut received largely harsh reviews; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;dizzyingly absurd&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; denounced it as &quot;the trashiest stab at candycane journalism yet.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Roone: A Memoir&quot;, Roone Arledge recalled that probably the most embarrassing part of that initial program was the Claymation segments featuring caricatures representing then-President Jimmy Carter (singing &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;) and Walter Cronkite (closing the program intoning, &quot;That&#x27;s the way it was&quot;). As a result of the scathing reviews, serious and drastic changes were immediately made: Hayes and Hughes were fired (as was original executive producer Bob Shanks), and a then semi-retired Hugh Downs was recruited to take on the role of sole host on the following week&#x27;s program.

Also featured in the premiere telecast of &quot;20/20&quot;, the opening sequence consisted of a pair of eyeglasses, whose lenses showed colored bars, which are often seen in the SMPTE color bars (used when television stations were off the air between sign-off and sign-on). The eyeglasses were keyed over a yellow background, and rotated to its rear position to reveal the &quot;20/20&quot; studio.

With Downs hosting, &quot;20/20&quot; changed into a more standard yet unique newsmagazine and received kinder reviews from critics. The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978–79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Emmy Award-winning producer, Bernard I. Cohen began his career with ABC evening news in 1964. From 1979 to 1992, he was a lead Producer at 20/20 and helped solidify the program&#x27;s top Nielsen Ratings. Ratings were generally very good during the summer months during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from &quot;Knots Landing&quot; on CBS and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line &quot;We&#x27;re in touch, so you be in touch&quot; to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line &quot;Around the world and into your home, the stories that touch your life&quot; as the introduction during the program&#x27;s opening titles for much of the 1990s).

Barbara Walters joined the program in 1979 in a role something less than a co-anchor and soon became a regular special contributor in the fall of 1981. In 1984, she was named as co-anchor and thus Hugh Downs&#x27;s equal, reuniting a duo which had already anchored together on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; from 1964 to 1971. The team would remain together on-air for the next 15 years.

In the fall of 1987, &quot;20/20&quot; was moved to Fridays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern, with the &quot;TGIF&quot; family comedy block as its longtime lead-in; while in that timeslot, it ranked at 21st place in the annual Nielsen ratings by the 1991–92 season. It aired in that same Friday time slot until the fall of 2001, when ABC briefly replaced the program with the scripted family drama series &quot;Once and Again&quot;, only for &quot;20/20&quot; to return to the lineup again four months later; it has basically retained the timeslot ever since. While the program briefly moved to the 8:00 p.m. timeslot on October 12, 2007, it reverted to its usual time two weeks later.

In the late 1990s, ABC began to expand the show to additional nights. In September 1997, a second weekly edition of &quot;20/20&quot; with Downs and Walters made its debut on Thursday evenings, later moving to Mondays. From September 1998 to September 2000, ABC News chose to consolidate its newsmagazine programs by combining &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Primetime Live&quot; into a singular brand under the &quot;20/20&quot; name and format to compete with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; (which itself ran for four nights a week at the time), and having former Primetime Live anchors Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer host &quot;20/20&quot; on Wednesday in the former show&#x27;s old timeslot. Additional nights were also added during this time with various anchors for each broadcast. At its peak, &quot;20/20&quot; ran on Mondays, Wednesdays and Sundays, in addition to its longtime Friday timeslot; these additional nights of &quot;20/20&quot; were joined by the younger-skewing &quot;20/20 Downtown&quot; on Thursday nights in October 1999. In September 2000, ABC reinstated &quot;Primetime&quot; under the title &quot;Primetime Thursday&quot;, and spun off &quot;20/20 Downtown&quot; as a separate newsmagazine simply titled &quot;Downtown&quot; on Monday evenings. By early 2002, &quot;20/20&quot; once again was airing only in its original Friday timeslot.

On March 3, 1999, Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who was infamously revealed to have been involved in an affair with then-President Bill Clinton a few years earlier, was interviewed by Barbara Walters on the program; that particular edition of &quot;20/20&quot; was watched by an estimated 70 million viewers, which ABC stated was a record audience for a news program.

After Downs&#x27; retirement in 1999, Walters became the solo anchor of &quot;20/20&quot;. This lasted until John Miller was hired as a permanent co-host of the program in 2002; Miller never got very comfortable in the anchor chair, and a year later, he jumped at the chance to rejoin law enforcement. For a few months in early 2003, Barbara Walters temporarily anchored solo again. However, in May of that year, John Stossel – an investigative correspondent for the program who was behind the controversial, though popular, &quot;Give Me a Break&quot; segments – was named as Walters&#x27; new co-anchor. As one of the first veteran anchors, Barbara Walters chose to go into semi-retirement as a broadcast journalist in 2004. However, she remained with &quot;20/20&quot; as a frequent contributor to the program. ABC News correspondent Elizabeth Vargas was promoted to the co-anchor position.

On August 25, 2008, &quot;20/20&quot; (alongside &quot;ABC World News&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot;) began broadcasting in high definition, with broadcasts presented in a pillarbox format for viewers with standard-definition television sets watching either through cable or satellite television. The program also introduced a new set and upconverted its existing graphics package to HD.

In September 2009, before the start of its 31st season, John Stossel announced he would leave the program after 28 years to pursue a new weekly show on Fox Business. Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer also contributed reports. On December 10, 2009, ABC News announced that &quot;Good Morning America&quot; news anchor Chris Cuomo was promoted to co-host &quot;20/20&quot; alongside Elizabeth Vargas. On January 29, 2013, it was announced that Chris Cuomo would leave ABC News and &quot;20/20&quot; for CNN to co-host the cable network&#x27;s new morning news program, &quot;New Day&quot;; on the same day, ABC announced David Muir would join Elizabeth Vargas as the new co-anchor of the program, in addition to continuing as weekend anchor of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; (a role he retains after being appointed to main anchor of the since-renamed &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; in September 2014).

The program expanded once again on March 2, 2013, with the debut of &quot;20/20 Saturday&quot;, which mainly features rebroadcasts of archived stories from previous editions of &quot;20/20&quot; (mainly those dating back as early as 2008) in the same single topic format as the flagship Friday broadcasts. &quot;20/20 Saturday&quot; airs outside of college football season, at either 9:00 p.m. as a two-hour broadcast formatted as separate hour-long episodes centered on two different topics or at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time as an hour-long broadcast, depending on the programs that precede it that given week. Barbara Walters originally served as host of the program until her retirement from regular television broadcasting in May 2014, after which the hosting duties were turned over the anchors of the Friday editions.

On December 22, 2017, Elizabeth Vargas announced that she would be leaving &quot;20/20&quot; and ABC News at the end of May. On April 23, 2018, Good Morning America news anchor Amy Robach was announced to take over as co-anchor alongside Muir in May; she subsequently departed from ABC News (and &quot;20/20&quot; by extension) on January 27, 2023, after the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reported the previous November on an affair between her and T.J. Holmes, who co-anchored &quot;GMA3: What You Need to Know&quot; with her. Meanwhile, Deborah Roberts was named a contributing anchor to &quot;20/20&quot; on October 4, 2022, via a note from ABC News President Kimberly Godwin.

The December 30, 2022 edition of the program was interrupted in the Eastern and Central time zones by news of Barbara Walters&#x27;s death around 9:30 p.m. ET, and anchor Phil Liphof anchored coverage for 90 minutes with ABC News&#x27;s official obituary and comment from other ABC News staff about her life and impact.

On December 19, 2024, ABC News aired the documentary &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;20/20 Downtown&quot;===
Unlike most other newsmagazines, &quot;20/20 Downtown&quot; was never carried by any big name anchor. An ensemble team of anchors fronted the broadcast, which was aimed at attracting younger viewers, but was hampered by many of the network&#x27;s larger market network affiliate stations bumping the program to late night or weekend timeslots to accommodate local pre-game shows or coach&#x27;s shows/highlight recap programming dealing with NFL or college football teams preceding ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. The anchor/reporting duties were filled by the team of Elizabeth Vargas, Cynthia McFadden, Chris Cuomo, Jay Schadler and John Quiñones. The program was renamed &quot;Downtown&quot; but was canceled in 2002. In 2003, the program returned for one season as &quot;Primetime Monday&quot;, with the same anchors and format.

===Special episodes===
Even though &quot;20/20&quot; still occasionally uses a multiple topic format, the program has seen a gradual shift towards single topic editions since the late 2000s (similar to what has occurred with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; since around the same timeframe, although continuing to include a wider range of topics), either in the form of various story packages that relate to the topic or a focus on a single story.

===&quot;Bad Romance: A Special Edition of 20/20&quot;===
==Theme music==
The distinctive theme music to &quot;20/20&quot; from Score Productions was written by Bob Israel (who also co-wrote theme music for now-cancelled fellow ABC series &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;) and based upon the longtime Lillian Scheinert-written theme used for &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. The original theme was revamped around 1993, and was subsequently replaced in 1999, along with the &quot;20/20&quot; logo and the anchor desk on the program&#x27;s set. Finally the orchestral &quot;20/20&quot; theme was updated in 2001, along with a few modifications in 2003 and 2005. In 2009, the theme was once again revamped, and once more in 2010, along with new graphics to reflect the news magazine&#x27;s new darker tone; this new theme was written by DreamArtists Studios. In 2012 the theme was revamped, again arranged by DreamArtists Studios.

In 2000 and 2001, then-Senator Peace authored the first laws in the nation aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals&#x27; personal information by requiring companies to inform consumers of data breaches. Senate Bill 129 also created the Office of Privacy Protection within the Department of Consumer Affairs to inform the public of potential options for protecting their privacy, receive complaints concerning persons unlawfully using others&#x27; personal information, and help prosecute identity theft and other privacy-related crimes.

Peace was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy from 1995–1997. During this time, the Electricity deregulation bill, AB 1890, was passed and signed into law by Governor Pete Wilson. The author was Jim Brulte, a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga. Many believed this bill led to the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001. Peace was listed as a &quot;principal co-author&quot; of the bill.

At the time, several prominent California newspapers came out in support of AB 1890, including the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;. An editorial from 1996 supported the measures taken by the legislature at the time: Last year, the California Public Utilities Commission rolled out a plan to turn electric power monopolies into free-market competitors. It was a flickering bulb. A half-dozen legislators and their staffs burned the midnight oil this summer to improve it. What they have produced glows brightly. Their plan protects residential and small business customers; it treats public and investor-owned utilities fairly; it maintains important social programs such as energy efficiency and assistance.

The &quot;Steve Peace Death March&quot; (over 200 hours of televised public hearings), produced a measure that passed both houses without any opposing votes. Afterwards, the California market collapsed. The consensus at the time was that the collapse was the result of flawed market design and consumer price caps included in AB1890. The resulting 2000–01 California electricity crisis was enough to cause him to abandon a possible run for California Secretary of State.

In the years after the energy crisis, successful legal challenges and information about market abuse by Enron and claims of ineffective federal oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission emerged, which Peace, asserts “proved” that the crisis was not a result of his energy bill, but rather companies taking advantage of deregulation to manipulate the market and consumers.

After being term-limited out of the State Senate, he served as Director of the California Department of Finance.

=== Later work ===
After leaving public service, Peace served as Senior Advisor to JMI Inc., the San Diego Padres and former Padres owner John Moores from 2005 to December 2016. He also served as a Founding Director of the California Independent Voter Project during which time he wrote California&#x27;s Nonpartisan Open Primary Constitutional Amendment which enacted a Nonpartisan blanket primary. He has served on the Board of the UCSD Scripps Institute of Oceanography and as Chairman of the Board of Chicago-based, Authentify, Inc., the privately held company that pioneered dual authentication security for online financial transactions. He currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Killer Tomatoes Entertainment and as a member of the Board of Directors of Preservation Ranch. He is a principal in the consulting firm JSPeace and Associates.

==== Presidential Endorsements ====
Peace endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Amy Klobuchar in the 2020 presidential election. However, in 2024, he crossed the party line and endorsed independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the presidency.

== Trivia ==
*In a &quot;Killer Tomatoes&quot; DVD making fun of &quot;Where are they now?&quot;, Peace was shown wearing a suit and walking into the California Senate with an open parachute attached to his back, spoofing his &quot;Killer Tomatoes&quot; character Wilbur Finletter, who was usually seen dragging an open parachute in the same manner.

<doc id="422228" wikidata="Q3501297" url="?curid=422228" title="Richardsonian Romanesque">
<text>Richardsonian Romanesque is a style of Romanesque Revival architecture named after the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838–1886). The revival style incorporates 11th- and 12th-century southern French, Spanish, and Italian Romanesque characteristics. Richardson first used elements of the style in his Richardson Olmsted Complex in Buffalo, New York, designed in 1870, and Trinity Church in Boston is his most well-known example of this medieval revival style. Multiple architects followed in this style in the late 19th century; Richardsonian Romanesque later influenced modern styles of architecture as well.

==History and development==

This very free revival style incorporates 11th and 12th century southern French, Spanish and Italian Romanesque characteristics. It emphasizes clear, strong picturesque massing, round-headed &quot;Romanesque&quot; arches, often springing from clusters of short squat columns, recessed entrances, richly varied rustication, blank stretches of walling contrasting with bands of windows, and cylindrical towers with conical caps embedded in the walling.

== Architects working in the style ==
The style includes work by the generation of architects practicing in the 1880s before the influence of the Beaux-Arts styles.

Some of the practitioners who most faithfully followed Richardson&#x27;s proportion, massing and detailing had worked in his office. These include:
*Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow and Frank Alden (Longfellow, Alden &amp; Harlow of Boston and Pittsburgh);
*George Shepley and Charles Coolidge (Richardson&#x27;s successor firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston);
*Herbert C. Burdett (Marling &amp; Burdett of Buffalo, New York)
*Mason Maury of Louisville, Kentucky

Other architects who employed Richardson Romanesque elements in their designs include: 
*Spier and Rohns and George D. Mason, both firms from Detroit
*Edward J. Lennox, Toronto-based architect;
*John Wellborn Root, in Chicago
*Harvey Ellis, in Minneapolis
*Theodore Link, in St. Louis and surrounding area

The style also influenced the Chicago school of architecture and architects Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Overseas, Folke Zettervall was influenced by the Richardson style when he designed several railway stations in Sweden during this period. In Finland, Eliel Saarinen was influenced by Richardson.

==Dispersion==

Research is underway to try to document the westward movement of the artisans and craftsmen, many of whom were immigrant Italians and Irish, who built in the Richardsonian Romanesque tradition. The style began in the East, in and around Boston, where Richardson built the influential Trinity Church on Copley Square. As the style was losing favor in the East, it was gaining popularity further west. Stone carvers and masons trained in the Richardsonian manner appear to have taken the style west, until it died out in the early decades of the 20th century.

As an example, four small bank buildings were built in Richardsonian Romanesque style in Osage County, Oklahoma, during 1904–1911: the Osage Bank of Fairfax, Bank of Hominy, Bank of Burbank, and Bank of Bigheart.

<doc id="422230" wikidata="Q1775801" url="?curid=422230" title="Battle of Sari Bair">
<text>The Battle of Sari Bair (), also known as the August Offensive (), represented the final attempt made by the British in August 1915 to seize control of the Gallipoli peninsula from the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.

At the time of the battle, the Gallipoli Campaign had raged on two fronts – Anzac and Helles – for three months since the Allied land invasion of 25 April 1915. With the Anzac front locked in a tense stalemate, the Allies had attempted to carry the offensive on the Helles battlefield – at enormous cost and for little gain. In August, the British command proposed a new operation to reinvigorate the campaign by capturing the Sari Bair ridge, the high ground that dominated the middle of the Gallipoli peninsula above the Anzac landing.

The main operation started on 6 August with a fresh landing north of Anzac at Suvla Bay in conjunction with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. The Allies mounted an attack north into the rugged country alongside the Sari Bair range with the aim of capturing the high ground and linking with the Suvla landing. At Helles, the British and French were now to remain largely on the defensive.

== Background ==
The battle took place primarily around the ridge of &quot;Kocaçimentepe&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;Great Grass Hill&quot; in Turkish. The peak was known to the British as &quot;Hill 971&quot; and they mistakenly applied the name for a lesser ridge to the main range, &quot;Sarı Bayır&quot;, meaning &quot;Yellow Slope&quot;, which ended at the imposing bluff above Anzac Cove known as &quot;The Sphinx&quot;.

== Prelude ==
The commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, General Sir Ian Hamilton, was provided with three British New Army divisions for the planned offensive; the 10th (Irish) Division, the 11th (Northern) Division and the 13th (Western) Division — all previously untried in battle. He was later reinforced with two Territorial Army divisions; the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 54th (East Anglian) Division and one division of dismounted yeomanry; the 2nd Mounted Division.

The Suvla landing was to be made by the British IX Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford who had retired in 1909 and had never commanded men in battle. His appointment was made based solely on seniority but his hesitancy during the preparations for the landing should have warned Hamilton that he was not a fit choice for the command.

The Ottomans were well aware that a renewal of the offensive was imminent. There had been some doubt about whether the British would abandon the campaign but this was dispelled when Winston Churchill made a careless speech in Dundee, stating that the battle would continue, whatever the sacrifices. Consequently, the Fifth Army underwent a reorganisation resulting in an expansion to 16 divisions. Ten of these defended the existing battlefields (six at Helles, which had seen the bulk of the early fighting, and four at Anzac). Three divisions defended the Asian shore of the Dardanelles and three divisions of the Ottoman XVI Corps defended the Gulf of Saros north of Bulair at the neck of the peninsula.

The Ottomans anticipated that the offensive would involve a breakout from Anzac but were unsure whether it would be north (towards Suvla) or south (towards Gaba Tepe). A new British landing was also considered likely but Suvla was not rated highly as a candidate, consequently, only a modest force of four battalions defended the area. The Ottoman commanders also dismissed the possibility of an assault against the Sari Bair range due to the rugged terrain. Only Mustafa Kemal, commander of the Ottoman 19th Division at Anzac, expected the attack against the heights but he was unable to convince his commanding officer, Esad Pasha to significantly strengthen the defenses there. Back in June he had made another attempt, through Captain Fahrettin Altay, then 3rd Army chief of staff, to persuade Esad Pasha to improve the defenses further north, but achieved no result other than raising the ire of his commanding officer. To placate him, only one regiment, the 14th was moved to the sector north of Anzac.

==Battle==
===Anzac breakout ===
The attack from the Anzac perimeter was directed against two peaks of the Sari Bair range; Chunuk Bair and Hill 971. Under the overall command of Major-General Alexander Godley, the attacking force included the New Zealand and Australian Division, the British 13th Division plus a couple of extra infantry brigades.

The plan was for two assaulting columns to march out of Anzac on the night of 6 August. The right-hand column, comprising the New Zealand Infantry Brigade under Brigadier-General Francis Johnston, would head for Chunuk Bair. The left-hand column, commanded by Major-General Herbert Cox, heading for Hill 971 and neighbouring Hill Q, contained the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade of Brigadier-General John Monash and Cox&#x27;s 29th Indian Brigade. Both objectives were expected to be captured by dawn.

To distract the Ottomans from the impending offensive, on 6 August, at 5.30 p.m., an attack was made at Lone Pine by the infantry brigades of the Australian 1st Division. While the attack was ultimately successful in capturing the Ottoman trenches, it was counterproductive as a diversion as it attracted reinforcements to the north. Another costly diversion was carried out at Helles which resulted in a pointless struggle over a patch of ground known as Krithia Vineyard. As was the case at Lone Pine, the British action at Helles did not restrain the Ottomans from sending reinforcements north to the Sari Bair range.

The right column heading for Chunuk Bair had a simpler navigation task as their route was to some degree visible from the old Anzac perimeter. In what became known as the Battle of Chunuk Bair, the New Zealanders failed to capture the peak by the morning of 7 August but managed the feat on the next morning.
On the morning following the breakout, a number of other attacks were planned within the old Anzac perimeter. The most notorious was the attack of the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade at The Nek whose slim chance of success had depended on the New Zealanders having captured Chunuk Bair on schedule.

The left column&#x27;s journey through the tangled ravines was doomed to failure and, having become lost and confused, it never got close to the objective of Hill 971. By the morning of 8 August Cox&#x27;s forces were sufficiently organised to attempt an attack on their original objectives of Hill 971 and Hill Q. However Monash&#x27;s brigade was still mistaken about its position relative to Hill 971. In fact, by the end of the day&#x27;s advance Monash&#x27;s troops had actually reached the position they had believed they had been starting from. Meanwhile, Hill 971 was more unreachable than ever. The three Australian battalions that had made the assault suffered 765 casualties — the 15th Battalion was reduced to about 30 per cent of its normal strength.

Of the force aiming for Hill Q, one battalion of the 6th Gurkhas commanded by Major Cecil Allanson and joined by disparate New Army men, moved to within 200 feet of Hill Q by 6 p.m. on 8 August where they sought shelter from the heavy Ottoman fire. After a naval artillery bombardment, the battalion attacked the summit shortly after 5 a.m. on 9 August. The plan of the attack, as concocted by General Godley, had involved numerous other battalions but all were lost or pinned down so the Gurkhas went on alone. They succeeded in driving the Ottomans off the hill but were then caught in further naval gunfire from friendly monitors or from an artillery battery at Anzac. Having suffered heavy casualties and with no reinforcements, Allanson&#x27;s force was pushed back off the hill shortly afterwards.

By the end of 9 August the Allies retained only a foothold on Chunuk Bair. On 10 August the Ottomans, led from the front by Colonel Mustafa Kemal, counter-attacked and regained control of the entire Sari Bair ridge.

=== Suvla landing ===

Stopford&#x27;s IX Corps comprised the British 10th (Irish) and 11th Divisions. At the time of the landing on 6 August the British were confronted by three Ottoman battalions under the command of a Bavarian cavalry officer, Major Wilhelm Willmer whose task was to delay the British until reinforcements could arrive from Bulair, away.

Stopford, who had decided to command the landings from HMS &quot;Jonquil&quot; that was anchored offshore, slept during the attack instead. The 11th Division landed on the night of 6 August and two brigades of the 10th Division landed the following morning. The landings, made in the dark without the aid of reliable reconnaissance, suffered from the same confusion that reigned at Anzac landing on 25 April. Lighters ran aground on sandbars so that the troops had to wade some distance to get ashore. Many units became intermingled and officers were unable to locate their objectives. Lala Baba was captured by the 6th Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment in what was the first combat action by any unit of the New Army of Lord Kitchener. The original objectives were the capture of the ridge lines to the north (Kiretch Tepe) and east (Tekke Tepe) and the line of hills to the south on the Anafarta Spur. Stopford&#x27;s &#x27;caution&#x27; and Hamilton&#x27;s failure to exert his will on his subordinate commanders, meant the objectives were diluted to little more than securing the beach.

By evening on 7 August, with the chain of command breaking down, progress had become minimal. Mostly due to Stopford still &quot;commanding&quot; from offshore, however, a lack of supplies, especially drinking water, weren&#x27;t helping matters. To the south east Chocolate Hill and Green Hill were taken in the evening with minimal resistance but constant harassment by shrapnel and sniper fire. The British suffered on the first day at Suvla.

General Sanders was incensed at the commander of the 7th and 12th divisions, Colonel Fevzi Bey, for not taking advantage of the Allied disarray at Suvla to pounce on them before they got organised. Turks not expecting a major landing at Suvla had to rush in the two divisions and Fevzi Bey dreaded night attacks, which were rarely successful. Sanders relieved Fevzi Bey immediately and gave the responsibility to Mustafa Kemal who was the commander of the 19th division and was now responsible for the front from Anzac Cove to Saros. He immediately planned for an attack along the Anafarta Hills. Given his success at Ariburnu earlier in spring, Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s arrival boosted the Ottoman morale.

The first serious Allied attempt at the ridges of the Anafarta Hills to the east was made on the night of 8 August, following intervention from Hamilton but on the morning of 9 August, the Ottoman reinforcements had begun to arrive and the British were driven back. The fighting concentrated around Scimitar Hill which protruded northwards from the Anafarta Spur and dominated the southern approach to the Tekke Tepe ridge. Scimitar Hill had been captured then abandoned on 8 August; attempts to retake the hill on 9 and 10 August, were thwarted by the Ottomans. The gunfire was so intense it set the undergrowth ablaze and many of the wounded were incinerated where they lay.

As the fighting developed, the landing was reinforced by the arrival of the British 53rd Division on 9 August, followed by the 54th Division on 10 August. Stopford now had four divisions under his corps command but was faced by a similar strength of Ottoman defenders. The 53rd Division was mauled in another attack on Scimitar Hill on 10 August.

On 15 August Hamilton sacked Stopford and a number of division and brigade commanders. The command of IX Corps was given to Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle, commander of the 29th Division until Lieutenant-General Julian Byng could travel from France to assume command.

== Aftermath ==

===Analysis===

Once the battles of 21 August had finished, the front lines at Suvla and Anzac remained static for the remainder of the campaign. Localised fighting continued but no more major advances were attempted. Many soldiers suffered or perished due to the hostile conditions they endured as a result of their poor preparation and training. Disease transmitted by mosquitoes and the lack of fresh water and shelter hampered the efforts of the division as the men were too weak to fight to their best ability. The insufficient knowledge had an impact of their advancement as their enemy were more familiar to the terrain and could ambush the division successfully. A combination of factors caused their success to be mixed.

===Subsequent operations===
As the shape of the new front line firmed, General Hamilton planned one further attack to try to link the Suvla landing to Anzac. This required the capture of a group of hills; Scimitar Hill and the &#x27;W&#x27; Hills from Suvla and Hill 60 from the new Anzac sector. The attacks were to commence on 21 August. At Suvla, de Lisle had his 29th Division and the 2nd Mounted Division which had been moved to Suvla as additional reinforcements.

The 29th Division was to attack Scimitar Hill while the 11th Division was to take the W Hills on the south of the Anafarta Spur. The 2nd Mounted Division was in reserve near Lala Baba on the far side of the salt lake. This attack was the largest mounted by the Allies at Gallipoli. Scimitar Hill was captured briefly but the attackers were driven off or killed by the defensive fire from the Ottomans higher up the spur. Once again the undergrowth ignited, burning many of the wounded. The 2nd Mounted Division were called to join the attack and advanced, marching in extended formation, straight across the salt lake, under fire the whole way. For a second time the hill was captured, briefly, before being lost for the final time. The attack of the 11th Division towards the W Hills was held up by strong Ottoman defences.

In the Anzac sector, Hill 60 had been unoccupied on the morning of 7 August, when Australian scouts passed across but the Ottomans swiftly occupied and fortified the hill. The Battle of Hill 60 lasted for eight days and while the summit was eventually reached, the Allies were unable to completely dislodge the Ottoman defenders who fought hard to hold their positions.

<text>The Jade Buddha Temple (, literally &quot;Jade Buddha Chan Temple&quot;) is a Buddhist temple in Shanghai. It was founded in 1882 with two jade Buddha statues imported to Shanghai from Myanmar by sea. These were a sitting Buddha (1.95 meters tall, 3 tons), and a smaller reclining Buddha representing the Buddha&#x27;s death. The temple now also contains a much larger reclining Buddha made of marble, donated from Singapore, and visitors may mistake this larger sculpture for the original, smaller piece.

 The legend behind the transport of the Buddha statues from Myanmar led to the popular usage of Burmese-style Buddha statues in Chinese temples.

==History==

During the reign of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1875–1908) in the Qing dynasty, Huigen, a Buddhist monk from Mount Putuo, went on a pilgrimage to Tibet via Mount Wutai and Mount Emei. He visited Burma after leaving Tibet. Whilst there, Chen Jun-Pu, an overseas Chinese resident in Burma, donated five jade Buddha statues to Huigen, who transported two of them back to Jiang-wan, Shanghai. Here, Huigen had a temple built with donated funds, and died shortly thereafter. This temple was occupied during the 1911 uprising, and the statues were moved to Maigen Road.

A Buddhist monk by the name of Kechen later had a new temple built on land donated by Sheng Xuanhuai, a senior official in the Qing imperial court. Sheng&#x27;s father and uncle were pious Buddhists. They built houses with thatched roofs at Yizhou Pond by the Zhuanghuabang River in the northeast of Shanghai. This can be accounted as the predecessor of the monastery. The construction took ten years, and lasted from 1918 to 1928. Kechen also invited Reverend Dixian from Mount Tiantai to come and lecture on Buddhism in a grand ceremony.

Master Taixu died in the Jade Buddha Temple on March 12, 1947.

In 1956, a ceremony was held at the temple by the Shanghai Buddhist Association to celebrate the 2500th anniversary of The Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment.

In 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, the monks made a living by selling handicrafts.

In 1983, the Shanghai Institute of Buddhism was established at the temple under the Shanghai Buddhist Association.

In 1985, Monk Zhizhi Xuan and others made a trip to Dunhuang via Xinjiang. Shortly after their return, regular scripture lectures, meditation and other features of temple life were resumed.

==Temple layout==
===Chamber of Four Heavenly Kings===
The Chamber of Four Heavenly Kings contains the statues of Maitreya, Skanda and the Four Heavenly Kings, who represent favorable circumstance. The chamber is located on the southern-edge, or &#x27;front&#x27; of the temple.

===Grand Hall===
The Grand Hall, also called the Great Hall, this hall contains many statues.
*Three Golden Buddhas. The central sculpture is of the Buddha, the left Amitabha and the right Bhaisajyaguru.
*Twenty Devas. Statues of the Twenty Devas, covered in gold, line the eastern and western sides of the Grand Hall.
*18 Arhats. 18 unique golden arhats stand in two groups of nine.
*Guanyin, Sudhana and his 53 teachers. A large golden statue of Guanyin stands on at northern entrance to the Great Hall, with Sudhana at Guanyin&#x27;s side and sculptures representing the 53 teachers of his life above.
===Jade Buddha Chamber===
The Jade Buddha Chamber is in the northern section of the temple, on the second floor. A fee of 10 yuan is charged to ascend to it. Some additional Buddhist sculptures are also viewable in the antechamber.

===Public restaurant===
The public restaurant is located on level two at the eastern edge of the temple and equipped with its own street entrance. Open daily, it serves a range of noodle dishes for five yuan per bowl, the most popular of which is &#x27;double mushroom noodles&#x27; (). Other dishes are served at moderate prices. Tickets are sold by color and this ticket is turned in inside the main eating room and your soup is then delivered to your table which you might share with others. Upstairs is a much more upscale restaurant at much higher prices.

===Other===
The temple also contains a private restaurant for the use of monks and temple volunteers, which is at the western edge of the temple complex. There is a visitor services office adjacent to the southern entrance, and a Buddhist library is also on the premises.

===Transport===
The public can board various public buses including Route 16 and can take the Line 13 of the Shanghai Metro to Jiangning Road Station to arrive at the Jade Buddha Temple.

<doc id="422245" wikidata="Q185573" url="?curid=422245" title="Czech lands">
<text>The Czech lands or the Bohemian lands (, ) is a historical-geographical term which denotes the three historical regions of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia out of which Czechoslovakia, and later the Czech Republic and Slovakia, were formed. Together the three have formed the Czech part of Czechoslovakia since 1919, and the Czech Republic since 1 January 1993.

In a historical context, Czech texts use the term to refer to any territory ruled by the Kings of Bohemia, i.e., the lands of the Bohemian Crown (&quot;&quot;) as established by Emperor Charles IV in the 14th century. This includes territories like the Lusatias (which in 1635 fell to Saxony) and the whole of Silesia, which at the time were all ruled from Prague Castle. Since the conquest of Silesia by the Prussian king Frederick the Great in the First Silesian War in 1742, the remaining lands of the Bohemian Crown—Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia—have been more or less co-extensive with the territory of the modern-day Czech Republic.

==Alternative names==

The term Czech lands has been used to describe different things by different people. While the Czech name of Bohemia proper is &quot;Čechy&quot;, the adjective &quot;český&quot; refers to both &quot;Bohemian&quot; and &quot;Czech&quot;. The non-auxiliary term (i.e. the term used in official Czech geographical terminology lists) for the present-day Czech lands (i.e. Bohemia, Moravia, Czech Silesia) is &quot;Česko&quot;, documented as early as 1704.

During the period of the First and Second Czechoslovak Republics, the Czech lands were frequently referred to as &quot;Historical lands&quot;, in particular when mentioned together with Slovakia (which was never an autonomous historical region within the Kingdom of Hungary).

==History==

The Bohemian lands had been settled by Celts (Boii) from 5th century BC until the 2nd century AD, and then by various Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards and others) until they moved on to the west during the Migration Period (1st–5th century). At the beginning of the 5th century the population decreased dramatically and, according to mythology, was led by a chieftain named &quot;Čech&quot;. The first Western Slavs came in the second half of the 6th century. In the course of the decline of the Great Moravian realm during the Hungarian invasions of Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries, the Czech Přemyslid dynasty established the Duchy of Bohemia. Backed by the East Frankish kings, they prevailed against the reluctant Bohemian nobility and extended their rule eastwards over the adjacent Moravian lands.

In 1198, Duke Ottokar I of Bohemia received the royal title by the German anti-king Philip of Swabia. Attached to his Kingdom of Bohemia was the Margraviate of Moravia established in 1182 and Kłodzko Land, the later County of Kladsko. From the second part of the 13th century onwards, German colonists (&quot;German Bohemians&quot;), who had already been living in Prague since the early 12th century, settled in the mountainous border area on the basis of the king&#x27;s invitation during the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;.

The Silesian lands north of the Sudetes mountain range had been ruled by the Polish Piast dynasty from the 10th century onwards. While Bohemia rose to a kingdom, the Silesian Piasts alienated from the fragmenting Kingdom of Poland. After in 1310 the Bohemian crown had passed to the mighty House of Luxembourg, nearly all Silesian dukes pledged allegiance to King John the Blind, and in 1335 the Polish king Casimir III the Great officially renounced Silesia via the Treaty of Trentschin. King John had also acquired the lands of Bautzen and Görlitz (later Upper Lusatia) in 1319 and 1329. His son and successor Charles IV, also King of the Romans since 1346, incorporated the Silesian and Lusatian estates into the Bohemian Crown and upon his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor confirmed their indivisibility from and affiliation with the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1367 Emperor Charles IV also purchased the former March of Lusatia (Lower Lusatia) in the northwest. However, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War both Lusatias passed to the Electorate of Saxony by the Peace of Prague. After the Bohemian Crown (Crown of Saint Wenceslas) passed to the House of Habsburg in 1526, the Bohemian crown lands together with the Kingdom of Hungary and the Austrian &quot;hereditary lands&quot; became part of the larger Habsburg monarchy. In 1742 the Habsburg queen Maria Theresa lost the bulk of Silesia to Prussia in the First Silesian War, part of the War of the Austrian Succession.
==Coats of arms==
 The coat of arms of the Czech Republic incorporates those of the three integral Czech lands: Bohemia proper, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. The arms of Bohemia originated with the Kingdom of Bohemia, like those of Moravia with the Moravian margraviate. The arms of Czech Silesia originated as those of all of the historical region of Silesia, much of which is now in Poland.

<doc id="422246" wikidata="Q3237270" url="?curid=422246" title="Lew Jenkins">
<text>Lew Jenkins (December 4, 1916 – October 30, 1981) was an American boxer and NYSAC and &quot;The Ring&quot; lightweight champion from 1940 to 1941. He was born in Milburn, Texas and was raised during the Great Depression. He began fighting in carnivals and later continued his boxing in the US Coast Guard. He was an exceptionally powerful puncher and 51 of his 73 wins were by knockout. His managers included Benny Woodhall, Frank Bachman, Hymie Kaplan, and Willie Ketchum and his trainer was Charley Rose.

His punching power was legendary, and so was his drinking, carousing, and penchant for high-speed motorcycles. &quot;The two toughest opponents I had were Jack Daniels and Harley Davidson,&quot; Lew Jenkins stated.

Jenkins took the World Lightweight Championship on May 10, 1940, in a third-round TKO against Lou Ambers at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden.

Jenkins was admitted to the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1977, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1983 and in 1999, the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Verlin E. Jenkins was born on December 4, 1916, in Milburn, Texas, to Artie James and Minnie Lee, formerly Minnie Lee White. He was the third of four children and had two older and one younger sisters. He started professional boxing around 1935 in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, but by 1938 was boxing regularly in Dallas. The biggest fights of his early career took place after he moved to New York in 1939.

==Professional career highlights==
Jenkins defeated Lew Feldman on April 8, 1938, in a ten-round split decision at the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas. Oddly, the Dallas crowd booed loudly after the decision of the judges and referees for Jenkins, the Texas native.

===Win over Mike Belloise, November 1939===
On November 21, 1939, Jenkins scored a seventh-round technical knockout against Mike Belloise, a former World Featherweight Champion, before a crowd of 12,000 at the Bronx&#x27;s New York Coliseum. Belloise was unable to answer the call of the bell for the eighth round due to the severe punishment he had taken to the body in the sixth and seventh rounds. It was later confirmed that Belloise suffered a broken rib from the bout.

On January 24, 1940, Jenkins convincingly defeated Cuban boxer Chino Alvarez in a knockout only around fifteen seconds into the first round at the Sportatorium in Dallas. Jenkins landed only two or three punches and the rowdy Dallas crowd booed when the ten count was completed, with several climbing into the ring. The victory was Jenkin&#x27;s ninth straight with six by knockouts. Jenkins sudden rise to prominence as a serious World Lightweight contender was not unprecedented, as he had been fighting professionally at least five years, but the quality of his opposition had increased dramatically in the last two years as many newspapers noted. When he defeated Tippy Larkin in a first-round knockout at Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1940, he was finally scheduled for a World Lightweight Title bout with reigning champion Lou Ambers. In the impressive win over Larkin, Jenkins started cautiously, then flicked a few straight lefts. After Jenkins blasted with both hands, and in &quot;2:41 of the first round Larkin was left flailing around in his own corner and down for the count.&quot;

===Taking the World Lightweight Championship, May 1940===
Jenkins defeated Lou Ambers in New York City on May 10, 1940, to become World Lightweight Champion. Ambers was down for a count of five in the first, briefly down again from a left in the second, and was down in the third before the referee stopped the bout when Jenkins landed a final solid right to Ambers&#x27; jaw.

After winning the World Lightweight Championship from Ambers, Jenkins lost his boxing discipline and spent time carousing at night and buying expensive automobiles. He drank recklessly, sometimes before bouts, and crashed several motorcycles and cars.

On March 8, 1940, Jenkins scored a first-round knockout of Tippy Larkin in a non-title bout at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden before a crowd of 11,542. &quot;Tearing out with the bell, the slugger from the Southwest (Jenkins) took command immediately. He threw both fists without a stop, finally connecting with a series of solid lefts and rights and Larkin dropped in his corner.&quot; The knockout occurred at the end of the first, 2:41 into the round. Jenkins had scored five straight knockouts in his most recent New York fights. A noteworthy opponent, Larkin would take the World Light Welterweight Championship in 1946.

On September 16, 1940, Jenkins managed to win a decision against Bob Montgomery in a non-title, ten-round decision, before a crowd of 12,900 at Shibe Park in Philadelphia. Jenkins was down in the third round for a count of nine. The United Press gave Jenkins five rounds to four for Montgomery, though ring officials gave Jenkins a somewhat wider margin. Montgomery would twice hold the NYSAC World Lightweight Championship in May 1943 and November 1944.

====World Lightweight Championship defense, November 1940====
On November 22, 1940, Jenkins successfully defended his World Lightweight Title against Pete Lello in a second-round knockout at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden before a largely hostile audience of around 11,000. Jenkins knocked Lello down four times in the second, usually with strong blows to the jaw and at least twice for counts of nine. He said after the bout that he had little memory of the bout after his first knockdown in the second. Lello had formerly knocked out Jenkins in a close bout that ended in an early seventh round victory in Chicago on March 24, 1939.

===Losing the World Lightweight Championship, December 1941===

On December 19, 1941, Jenkins lost his World Lightweight Title against Sammy Angott before a crowd of 11,343 at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Fighting with a neck injury he may have received from motorcycle and car crashes, he was outpointed over 15 rounds. From then on he lost a significant percentage of his remaining bouts, though often against quality competition.

On September 30, 1949, Jenkins defeated Eddie Giosa in a ten-round unanimous decision at the Arena in Philadelphia. He had Giosa down for a count of eight in the second from a left hook, then put him to the mat again with a right to the head. He had Giosa down again in the tenth with a left hook to the head for a count of eight, though the fight continued and was determined by a points decision. Both men fought at 139 in the welterweight range. He had formerly lost to Giosa on May 2, 1949, in a fairly close split decision at the same location. The May victory was Giosa&#x27;s fourth straight win.

==Military career==
Jenkins served in the Coast Guard in World War II, where he participated in troop deployment, and found himself in the thick of battle during the Allied invasions of North Africa and the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France. He re-enlisted in the infantry at the outbreak of America&#x27;s involvement in the Korean War around 1950 and was awarded the Silver Star for saving several men from enemy fire.

==Boxing comeback==
He attempted a comeback after World War II, but was unable to regain his status as a top lightweight and welterweight. He retired from boxing in 1950. In 2003, Jenkins made the Ring Magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

Jenkins died October 30, 1981, at the Oakland Naval Regional Medical Center after a long illness. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>In philosophy, self-awareness is the awareness and reflection of one&#x27;s own personality or individuality, including traits, feelings, and behaviors. It is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of qualia. While consciousness is being aware of one&#x27;s body and environment, self-awareness is the recognition of that consciousness. Self-awareness is how an individual experiences and understands their own character, feelings, motives, and desires.

==Biology==
===Mirror neurons===
Researchers are investigating which part of the brain allows people to be self-aware and how people are biologically programmed to be self-aware. V.S. Ramachandran speculates that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of human self-awareness. In an essay written for the Edge Foundation in 2009, Ramachandran gave the following explanation of his theory: &quot;[T]hese neurons can not only help simulate other people&#x27;s behavior but can be turned &#x27;inward&#x27;—as it were—to create second-order representations or meta-representations of your &quot;own&quot; earlier brain processes. This could be the neural basis of introspection, and of the reciprocity of self awareness and other awareness. There is obviously a chicken-or-egg question here as to which evolved first, but... The main point is that the two co-evolved, mutually enriching each other to create the mature representation of self that characterizes modern humans.&quot;

===Body===
Bodily (self-)awareness is related to proprioception and visualization. In health and medicine, body awareness refers to a person&#x27;s ability to direct their focus on various internal sensations accurately. Both proprioception and interoception allow individuals to be consciously aware of multiple sensations. Proprioception allows individuals and patients to focus on sensations in their muscles and joints, posture, and balance, while interoception is used to determine sensations of the internal organs, such as fluctuating heartbeat, respiration, lung pain, or satiety. Over-acute body-awareness, under-acute body-awareness, and distorted body-awareness are symptoms present in a variety of health disorders and conditions, such as obesity, anorexia nervosa, and chronic joint pain. For example, a distorted perception of satiety is present in a patient suffering from anorexia nervosa.

==Psychology==
Self-awareness has been called &quot;arguably the most fundamental issue in psychology, from both a developmental and an evolutionary perspective.&quot;

Self-awareness theory, developed by Duval and Wicklund in their 1972 landmark book &quot;A theory of objective self awareness&quot;, states that when we focus on ourselves, we evaluate and compare our current behavior to our internal standards and values. This elicits a state of objective self-awareness. We become self-conscious as objective evaluators of ourselves. Self-awareness should not be confused with self-consciousness. Various emotional states are intensified by self-awareness. However, some people may seek to increase their self-awareness through these outlets. People are more likely to align their behavior with their standards when they are made self-aware. People are negatively affected if they do not live up to their personal standards. Various environmental cues and situations induce awareness of the self, such as mirrors, an audience, or being videotaped or recorded. These cues also increase the accuracy of personal memory.

In one of Andreas Demetriou&#x27;s neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, self-awareness develops systematically from birth through the life span and it general inferential processes. Self-awareness about cognitive processes contributes to general intelligence on a par with processing efficiency functions, such as working memory, processing speed, and reasoning.

Albert Bandura&#x27;s theory of self-efficacy describes &quot;the belief in one&#x27;s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.&quot; A person&#x27;s belief in their ability to succeed sets the stage for how they think, behave, and feel. Someone with a strong self-efficacy, for example, views challenges as tasks to engage in, and is not easily discouraged by setbacks. Such a person is aware of their flaws and abilities and chooses to utilize these qualities to the best of their ability. Someone with a weak sense of self-efficacy evades challenges and quickly feels discouraged by setbacks. They may not be aware of these negative reactions and therefore, may not be prompted to change their attitude. This concept is central to Bandura&#x27;s social cognitive theory, &quot;which emphasizes the role of observational learning, social experience, and reciprocal determinism in the development of personality.&quot;

== Human development ==

===Developmental stages===
Individuals become conscious of themselves through the development of self-awareness. This particular type of self-development pertains to becoming conscious of one&#x27;s body and one&#x27;s state of mind—including thoughts, actions, ideas, feelings, and interactions with others. &quot;Self-awareness does not occur suddenly through one particular behavior: it develops gradually through a succession of different behaviors all of which relate to the self.&quot; The monitoring of one&#x27;s mental states is called metacognition and is considered to be an indicator that there is some concept of the self. 

According to Philippe Rochat, there are five levels of self-awareness that unfold in early human development and six potential prospects ranging from &quot;Level 0&quot; (having no self-awareness) advancing complexity to &quot;Level 5&quot; (explicit self-awareness):

* Level 0—Confusion: The person is unaware of any mirror reflection or the mirroring itself; they perceive a mirror image as an extension of their environment.

* Level 1—Differentiation: The individual realizes the mirror is able to reflect things. They see that what is in the mirror is of a different nature from what is surrounding them. At this level they can differentiate between their own movement in the mirror and the movement of the surrounding environment.

* Level 2—Situation: The individual can link the movements on the mirror to what is perceived within their own body.

* Level 3—Identification: An individual can now see that what&#x27;s in the mirror is not another person but actually them.

* Level 4—Permanence: The individual is able to identify the self in previous pictures looking different or younger. A &quot;permanent self&quot; is now experienced.

* Level 5—Self-consciousness or &quot;meta&quot; self-awareness: At this level not only is the self seen from a first person view but it is realized that it is also seen from a third person&#x27;s view. A person who develops self consciousness begins to understand they can be in the mind of others: for instance, how they are seen from a public standpoint.

=== Infancy and early childhood ===
When a human infant comes into the world, they have no concept of what is around them, nor the significance of others around them. At first &quot;the infant cannot recognize its own face&quot;. At only a few months old, infants know the relationship between the proprioceptive and visual information they receive. This is called &quot;first-person self-awareness&quot;. 

By the time an average toddler reaches 18–24 months, they discover themselves and recognize their own reflection in the mirror, however the exact age varies with differing socioeconomic levels and differences relating to culture and parenting. Those who reach this level of awareness recognize that they see themselves, for instance, seeing dirt on their face in the reflection and then touching their face to wipe it off. Soon after toddlers become reflectively self-aware, they begin to recognize their bodies as physical objects in time and space that interact and impact other objects. For instance, a toddler placed on a blanket, when asked to hand someone the blanket, will recognize that they need to get off it to be able to lift it. This is the final stage of body self-awareness and is called objective self-awareness.

By 18 months of age, an infant can communicate their name to others, and upon being shown a picture they are in, they can identify themselves. By two years old, they also usually acquire gender category and age categories, saying things such as &quot;I am a girl, not a boy&quot; and &quot;I am a baby or child, not a grownup&quot;. As an infant moves to middle childhood and onwards to adolescence, they develop more advanced levels of self-awareness and self-description. By the age of 24 months, the toddler will observe and relate their own actions to actions of other people and the surrounding environment.

As a preschooler, they begin to give much more specific details about things, instead of generalizing. At this age, the child is in what Jean Piaget names the &quot;pre operational&quot; stage of development. The infant is very inaccurate at judging themselves. For example, an infant at this stage will not associate that they are strong with their ability to cross the jungle gym at their school, nor will they associate the fact that they can solve a math problem with their ability to count.

Around school age, a child&#x27;s awareness of their memory transitions into a sense of their self. At this stage, a child begins to develop interests, likes, and dislikes. This transition enables a person&#x27;s awareness of their past, present, and future to grow as they remember their conscious experiences more often. 

=== Adolescence ===
One becomes conscious of one&#x27;s emotions during adolescence. Most children are aware of emotions such as shame, guilt, pride, and embarrassment by the age of two, but do not fully understand how those emotions affect their life. By age 13, children become more in touch with these emotions and begin to apply them to their lives. Many adolescents display happiness and self-confidence around friends, but hopelessness and anger around parents due to the fear of being a disappointment. Teenagers may feel intelligent and creative around teachers, while they may feel shy, uncomfortable, and nervous around people they are not familiar with.

As children reach adolescence, their acute sense of emotion has widened into a meta-cognitive state in which mental health issues can become more prevalent due to heightened emotional and social development. Self-awareness training may reduce anger management issues and reduce aggressive tendencies in adolescents.

In adolescent development, self-awareness has a more complex emotional context than in the early childhood phase. Elements can include self-image, self-concept, and self-consciousness among other traits that relate to Rochat&#x27;s final level of self awareness, however self-awareness remains a distinct concept.

== Measurement ==
There are two common methods used to measure how severe an individual&#x27;s lack of self-awareness is. The Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS) evaluates self-awareness in patients who have endured a traumatic brain injury. PCRS is a 30-item self-report instrument which asks the subject to use a 5-point Likert scale to rate his or her degree of difficulty in a variety of tasks and functions. Independently, relatives or significant others who know the patient well are also asked to rate the patient on each of the same behavioral items. The difference between the relatives&#x27; and patient&#x27;s perceptions is considered an indirect measure of impaired self-awareness. The limitations of this experiment rest on the answers of the relatives. Results of their answers can lead to a bias. In addition, in terms of treatment effectiveness, this experimental method works better for individuals with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury, but less effectively for those with mild brain injury. This is because, although individuals with mild brain injury fall within the normal range in psychological test results, they may still experience cognitive difficulties. Therefore, these everyday difficulties are more apparent in subjective assessments and behavioral observations. These two limitations prompted a second method of testing a patient&#x27;s self-awareness. Simply asking a patient why they are in the hospital or what is wrong with their body can give compelling answers as to what they see and are analyzing.

==Disorders==
=== Anosognosia ===

The medical term for not being aware of one&#x27;s deficits is anosognosia, or more commonly known as a lack of insight. Having a lack of awareness raises the risks of treatment and service nonadherence. A wide variety of disorders are associated with anosognosia. For example, patients who are blind from cortical lesions might in fact be unaware that they are blind and may state that they do not suffer from any visual disturbances. Individuals with aphasia may be unaware of certain speech errors. Individuals who suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease lack awareness; this deficiency becomes more intense throughout their disease. A key issue with this disorder is that people who do have anosognosia and suffer from certain illnesses may not be aware of them, which ultimately leads them to put themselves in dangerous positions.

===Autism spectrum disorder===

A 2008 study suggested that self-awareness in autistic individuals is primarily lacking in social situations, but when in private they are more self-aware and present. It is in the company of others while engaging in interpersonal interaction that the self-awareness mechanism seems to fail. Higher functioning individuals on the autism spectrum disorder scale have reported that they are more self-aware when alone unless they are in sensory overload or immediately following social exposure. Self-awareness dissipates when an autistic is faced with a demanding social situation, possibly due to the behavioral inhibitory system which is responsible for self-preservation. A 2012 study of individuals with Asperger syndrome &quot;demonstrated impairment in the &#x27;self-as-object&#x27; and &#x27;self-as-subject&#x27; domains of the Self-understanding Interview&quot;.

===Schizophrenia===
Schizophrenia as a disease state is characterized by severe cognitive dysfunction and it is uncertain to what extent patients are aware of this deficiency. Medalia and Lim (2004) investigated patients&#x27; awareness of their cognitive deficit in the areas of attention, nonverbal memory, and verbal memory. Results from this study (N=185) revealed large discrepancy in patients&#x27; assessment of their cognitive functioning relative to the assessment of their clinicians. Though it is impossible to access one&#x27;s consciousness and truly understand what a schizophrenic believes, regardless in this study, patients were not aware of their cognitive dysfunctional reasoning. 

A 1993 study suggests a correlation exists between patient insight, compliance, and disease progression. Patients with poor insight are less likely to be compliant with treatment and are more likely to have a poorer prognosis. Patients with hallucinations sometimes experience positive symptoms, which can include delusions of reference, thought insertion/withdrawal, thought broadcast, delusions of persecution, and grandiosity.

==Non-human animals==

&quot;Mirror tests&quot; have been done on chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins and magpies. During the test, the experimenter looks for the animals to undergo four stages:
# social response (behaving toward the reflection as they would toward another animal of their species)
# physical mirror inspection
# repetitive mirror testing behavior, and
# the mark test, which involves the animals spontaneously touching a mark on their body that would have been difficult to see without the mirror

The red-spot technique, created by Gordon G. Gallup, studies self-awareness in primates. This technique places a red odorless spot on an anesthetized primate&#x27;s forehead. The spot is placed on the forehead so it can only be seen through a mirror. Once the primate awakens, its independent movements toward the spot after it sees its reflection in a mirror are observed.

David DeGrazia identifies three types of self-awareness which animals may share with humans. Bodily self-awareness allows animals to understand that they are different from the rest of the environment. It explains why animals do not eat themselves. Bodily-awareness also includes proprioception and sensation. Social self-awareness, seen in highly social animals, allows animals to interact with each other. Introspective self-awareness is how animals might sense feelings, desires, and beliefs. 

=== Apes ===
Chimpanzees and other apes—extensively studied species—are most similar to humans, with the most convincing findings and straightforward evidence of self-awareness in animals. During the red-spot technique, after looking in the mirror, chimpanzees used their fingers to touch the red dot on their forehead and, after touching the red dot they would smell their fingertips. &quot;Animals that can recognize themselves in mirrors can conceive of themselves,&quot; says Gallup.

=== Dolphins ===
Dolphins were put to a similar test and achieved the same results. Diana Reiss, a psycho-biologist at the New York Aquarium discovered that bottlenose dolphins can recognize themselves in mirrors.

===Elephants===
In a 2006 study, one elephant out of three passed the mirror test.

=== Magpies ===
Researchers also used the mark or mirror tests to study the magpie&#x27;s self-awareness. As a majority of birds are blind below the beak, Prior &quot;et al.&quot; marked the birds&#x27; neck with three different colors: red, yellow, and black (as an imitation, as magpies are originally black). When placed in front of a mirror, the birds with red and yellow spots began scratching at their necks, signaling the understanding of something different being on their bodies. During one trial with a mirror and a mark, three of the five magpies showed at least one example of self-directed behavior. The magpies explored the mirror by moving toward it and looking behind it. One of the magpies, Harvey, during several trials would pick up objects, pose, do some wing-flapping, all in front of the mirror with the objects in his beak. This represents a sense of self-awareness; knowing what is going on within himself and in the present. The authors suggest that self-recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of convergent evolution, where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviors or traits, although they arrive at them via different routes.

A few slight occurrences of behavior towards the magpie&#x27;s own body happened in the trial with the black mark and the mirror. The authors of this study suggest that the black mark may have been slightly visible on the black feathers. &quot;This is an indirect support for the interpretation that the behavior towards the mark region was elicited by seeing the own body in the mirror in conjunction with an unusual spot on the body.&quot;

There was a clear contrast between the behaviors of the magpies when a mirror was present versus absent. In the no-mirror trials, a non-reflective gray plate was swapped in the same size and position as the mirror. There were not any mark-directed self-behaviors when the mark was present, in color or in black. The results show that magpies understand that a mirror image represents their own body; magpies have self-awareness.

== Other uses ==
=== Plants ===
Self-discrimination in plants is found within their roots, tendrils and flowers that avoid themselves but not others in their environment.

=== Science fiction ===
In science fiction, self-awareness describes an essential human property that often (depending on the circumstances of the story) bestows personhood onto a non-human. If a computer, alien or other object is described as &quot;self-aware&quot;, the reader may assume that it will be treated as a completely human character, with similar rights, capabilities and desires to a normal human being. The words &quot;sentience&quot;, &quot;sapience&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; are used in similar ways in science fiction.

===Collective self-awareness===
Alongside self-awareness seen as a personal capability, the same term may be applied to the self-awareness of groups or organisations. Steffens &quot;et al&quot;. note the &quot;importance of both personal and collective dimensions of selfhood&quot; when looking at leadership. Pope Paul VI, in his first encyclical letter, &quot;Ecclesiam Suam&quot; (1964), refers to &quot;an increased self awareness on the part of the [Catholic] Church&quot; as a fundamental requirement to ensure the church survived with a clear mission in the face of the changing secular context in which it operated.

=== Robotics ===

It has been proposed that robots which use internal models to simulate their own actions could be classified as functionally self-aware. This definition does not concern itself with the philosophical question of whether these robots really are self-aware.

<text>Emperor Ai of Jin (; 341 – March 30, 365), personal name Sima Pi (), courtesy name Qianling (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. During his brief reign, the actual powers were largely in the hands of his granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji, and the paramount general Huan Wen. According to historical accounts, he had an obsession with immortality, which resulted in his death, brought about as a result of poisoning by pills given to him by magicians in 364 and in 365.

==Early life==
Sima Pi was born in 341, during the reign of his father Emperor Cheng of Jin, as Emperor Cheng&#x27;s oldest son. His mother was Consort Zhou, who in 342 gave birth to his younger brother Sima Yi. In summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew ill. The common succession protocol, as He Chong (何充) pointed out, would mean that his oldest son would succeed to the throne, but Emperor Cheng&#x27;s uncle Yu Bing (庾冰), wanting a new emperor who would also be connected to his clan as well, persuaded Emperor Cheng to pass the throne to his younger brother Sima Yue the Prince of Langya, also a son of his sister Yu Wenjun, under the reasoning that with the powerful rival Later Zhao to the north, the empire needed an adult emperor. Emperor Cheng agreed, and named Sima Yue as the heir, and Sima Yue succeeded to the throne as Emperor Kang when he died soon after. The one-year-old Sima Pi was instead created the Prince of Langya on 1 August 342. He continued in that title after Emperor Kang&#x27;s death in November 344, as Emperor Kang chose to pass the throne to his infant son Sima Dan (as Emperor Mu). It is not known when he married his wife Wang Muzhi, only that she carried the title Princess Consort of Langya.

==Reign==

In July 361, Emperor Mu died without a son. Emperor Mu&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Chu thus ordered that Sima Pi be made emperor, and he took the throne as Emperor Ai, at age 20. He created his wife Princess Consort Wang as empress in October 361, and his brother Sima Yi, who previously carried the title the Prince of Donghai, as the Prince of Langya. Since he was an adult, Empress Dowager Chu did not serve as regent for him, and he honored his mother Consort Zhou as Consort Dowager () in 362, but with supplies and ceremonies similar to the empress dowager. However, the decision-making process was largely in the hands of the general Huan Wen and Emperor Ai&#x27;s granduncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji.

In 362, Huan, after securing the Luoyang region, requested that the capital be moved back to Luoyang, where it had been until it had been captured by Han Zhao in 311. The imperial government, under an edict issued by Emperor Ai, declined.

In 363, Consort Dowager Zhou died. In accordance with proper protocol that he could no longer honor her as mother, out of respect for Empress Dowgaer Chu, Emperor Ai did not observe the normal mourning period due to a mother.

Emperor Ai was obsessed with seeking immortality, and despite his young age, he died from Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning. In 364, he became poisoned by pills given him by magicians, and he grew so ill that he was unable to handle important matters. Empress Dowager Chu had to resume regency on his behalf.

Later in 364, Former Yan launched a major attack against Luoyang, and Huan and Sima Yu considered a counterattack to relieve Luoyang. However, as Emperor Ai died in March 365, that plan was cancelled, and Luoyang soon fell. As he did not have a son, Emperor Ai was succeeded by his brother Sima Yi, as Emperor Fei. Emperor Ai was preceded in death by his wife Empress Wang, who died about a month before he died; they were buried together with imperial honors.

<doc id="422269" wikidata="Q270215" url="?curid=422269" title="Contact (1997 American film)">
<text>Contact is a 1997 American science fiction drama film in Panavision co-produced and directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on the 1985 novel by Carl Sagan. It stars Jodie Foster as Dr. Eleanor &quot;Ellie&quot; Arroway, a SETI scientist who finds evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact. Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt, Angela Bassett, Rob Lowe, Jake Busey, and David Morse co-star. It features the Very Large Array in New Mexico, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the &quot;Mir&quot; space station, and the Space Coast surrounding Cape Canaveral.

Sagan and his wife, Ann Druyan, began working on &quot;Contact&quot; in 1979. They wrote a film treatment over 100 pages long and set up the project at Warner Bros. with Peter Guber and Lynda Obst as producers. When development stalled, Sagan published &quot;Contact&quot; as a novel in 1985, and the film reentered development in 1989. Roland Joffé and George Miller planned to direct, but Joffé dropped out in 1993, and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995. With Zemeckis as director, filming ran from September 1996 to February 1997. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the visual and special effects.

&quot;Contact&quot; was released on July 11, 1997, and received positive reviews, winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and two Saturn Awards. It grossed over $171 million worldwide.

==Plot==

Dr. Ellie Arroway works for the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. She was inspired to pursue a career in science, starting with amateur radio, by her father, who died in her youth. Her work involves listening to radio emissions from space in the hopes of finding signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life. The program loses funding after David Drumlin, the President&#x27;s science advisor, deems it futile. However, Arroway receives financial support from S. R. Hadden, the secretive billionaire industrialist who runs Hadden Industries, which enables her to keep working at the Very Large Array in New Mexico.

Four years later, when Drumlin is about to terminate the SETI program at the VLA, Arroway discovers a signal containing a sequence of prime numbers that appears to have originated from the star Vega. This announcement leads Drumlin and the National Security Council, headed by Michael Kitz, to attempt to seize control of the facility. Upon further investigation, Arroway&#x27;s team discovers a video hidden within the signal: Adolf Hitler&#x27;s opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, believed to have been the first transmission strong enough to penetrate the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, eventually reaching Vega, and now was sent back to Earth as part of the signal.

The project is put under tight security and its progress is monitored around the world. Arroway discovers the signal contains over 63,000 pages of encoded data, and Hadden meets with Arroway to provide her with the means to decode it. The decoded data reveals schematics for a Machine that may be a form of transportation for a single individual. Multiple nations provide funding for the Machine’s construction, which is built at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. An international panel will select a candidate to travel in the Machine. Arroway is a leading candidate until Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a member of the panel with whom she briefly had a romantic relationship in Puerto Rico, draws attention to her atheism. This makes the panel select Drumlin, for supposedly being a better representation of humanity (despite having never professed any faith). During the first tests a religious terrorist named Joseph destroys the Machine with a suicide bomb, killing himself, Drumlin, and several others.

Hadden, now residing on the &quot;Mir&quot; space station and dying of cancer, reveals to Arroway the U.S. government and his company have used a secret contract to build a second Machine in Japan. Arroway, the only American remaining among the candidate pool, will be the one to go. Equipped with multiple recording devices, Arroway enters a pod which is dropped into the Machine, and seemingly travels through multiple wormholes. Arroway observes a radio array-like structure at Vega, signs of civilization on an alien planet, and a celestial event that makes her ecstatic, until finally finding herself on a beach, similar to a childhood drawing she made of Pensacola, Florida. A figure approaches, taking on the appearance of her deceased father, whom Arroway recognizes as an alien. His people detected Humanity’s radio emissions, and now judged the latter as worthy of being shown a first step into the cosmos.

Arroway loses consciousness. Upon regaining it she finds herself lying in the pod, while the mission control team repeatedly tries to contact her. She learns that, from the outside, the Machine only appears to have dropped the pod into a safety net. Arroway insists she was gone for about 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static noise. A Congressional Committee headed by Kitz is convened, who speculates the signal and machine were a hoax designed by Hadden, who has since passed away. Arroway requests the committee accept the truth of her testimony on faith, declaring while her testimony cannot be proven scientifically, it has impacted her humanity. Arroway reunites with Joss, who professes faith in her story and, after Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine privately discuss the confidential information that although Arroway&#x27;s recording device only recorded static, it recorded approximately 18 hours of it, she receives ongoing financial support for the SETI program at the VLA.

==Production==
===Development===
Carl Sagan conceived &quot;Contact&quot; in 1979. That year, Lynda Obst, one of his closest friends, was hired by film producer Peter Guber as a studio executive for his production company, Casablanca FilmWorks. She pitched Guber the idea for &quot;Contact&quot;, and he commissioned a development deal. Sagan and Ann Druyan (who were later married) finished their film treatment in November 1980. Druyan explained:
They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.

Sagan incorporated Kip Thorne&#x27;s study of wormhole space travel. The characterization of Ellie Arroway was inspired by Jill Tarter, head of Project Phoenix of the SETI Institute; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her. The name Ellie was short for Eleanor, which was taken from Eleanor Roosevelt whom both Sagan and Druyan adored; Arroway was selected based on both Voltaire&#x27;s real name (Arouet), and that Ellie &quot;was going to travel like an arrow through the cosmos&quot;, according to Druyan. Tarter served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying career struggles of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the film&#x27;s end. Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyan&#x27;s treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them a Native American park ranger turned astronaut. Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, whom he believed would add depth to the storyline. Guber said:

Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Guber&#x27;s idea, and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took &quot;Contact&quot; to Warner Bros. Pictures, and with the film&#x27;s development stalled, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a novel, which was published by Simon and Schuster in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development, and Guber eventually vacated his position at Warner Bros. in 1989.

Guber became the new president of Sony Pictures Entertainment and tried to purchase the film rights of &quot;Contact&quot; from Warner Bros., but the studio refused. Coincidentally, in 1989, Obst was hired as a new executive at Warner Bros. and began to fast-track the film by hiring more writers. Roland Joffé was eventually hired to direct, using a screenplay by James V. Hart. Joffé almost commenced pre-production before he dropped out, and Obst then hired Michael Goldenberg to rewrite the script, who finished his second draft in late 1993. Goldenberg&#x27;s second draft rekindled Warner Bros.&#x27; interest in &quot;Contact&quot;, and Robert Zemeckis was offered the chance to direct, but he turned down the opportunity in favor of making a film based on the life of Harry Houdini. Zemeckis recalled:

In December 1993, Warner Bros. hired George Miller to direct, and &quot;Contact&quot; commenced pre-production. Many actress wanted the lead role, including Julia Roberts, Miller considered Uma Thurman before he cast Jodie Foster, approached Ralph Fiennes to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting Linda Hunt as the President of the United States. In addition to having aliens put on a laser lighting display around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite &quot;Contact&quot; in an attempt to portray the Pope as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller&#x27;s direction pre-production lasted longer than expected. Warner Bros. fired Miller, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller&#x27;s insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting. Robert Zemeckis, who previously turned down the director&#x27;s position, decided to accept the offer. Warner Bros. granted Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege. Zemeckis cast Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss; McConaughey dropped out of the lead role in &quot;The Jackal&quot; to take the role in &quot;Contact&quot;. Despite being diagnosed with myelodysplasia in 1994, Sagan continued to be involved in the production of the film. For the cast and main crew members, he conducted an academic conference that depicted a detailed history of astronomy. During the development, the production crew watched Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) for inspiration.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on September 24, 1996, and ended on February 28, 1997. The first shooting took place at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico. &quot;Shooting at the VLA was, of course, spectacular but also one of the most difficult aspects of our filming&quot;, producer Steve Starkey said. &quot;It is a working facility, so in order for us to accomplish shots for the movie, we had to negotiate with the National Science Foundation for &#x27;dish control&#x27; in order to move the dishes in the direction we needed to effect the most dramatic shot for the story.&quot; After arduous first weeks of location shooting in New Mexico and Arizona, production for &quot;Contact&quot; returned to Los Angeles for five months&#x27; worth of location and sound stage shooting that used a total of nine soundstages at Warner Hollywood Studios in West Hollywood, and Culver Studios. All together, the art department created more than 25 sets.

In an attempt to create a sense of realism for the storyline, principal CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into &quot;Contact&quot;. More than 25 news reporters from CNN had roles in the film, and the CNN programs &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and &quot;Crossfire&quot; were also included. Ann Druyan makes a cameo appearance as herself, debating with Rob Lowe&#x27;s character, Richard Rank, on &quot;Crossfire&quot;. In January 1997, second unit filming, directed by producer Steve Starkey took place for one week at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

Other second unit work took place in Fiji, Saint John, US Virgin Islands and Newfoundland, Canada. Also essential to the production were a host of technical consultants from the SETI Institute, the California Institute of Technology, the VLA and a former White House staff member to consult on Washington, D.C., and government protocol issues. Sagan visited the set a number of times, where he also helped with last-minute rewrites. Filming was briefly delayed with the news of his death on December 20, 1996. &quot;Contact&quot; was dedicated to Sagan: &quot;For Carl&quot; appears on the screen at the fade.

Cinematographer Don Burgess shot the film in anamorphic format using Panavision cameras, as well as using large-format 65 mm and VistaVision for visual and special effects shots. The sound designers used Pro Tools software for the sound mixing, which was done at Skywalker Sound.

===Visual effects===
Designing &quot;Contact&quot;″s visual effects sequences was a joint effort by eight VFX companies, including Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI), Weta Digital, Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Warner Digital, and Effects Associates, with Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan used for CGI rendering. Weta Digital, in particular, was responsible for designing the wormhole sequence. Jodie Foster admitted that she had difficulty with blue screen technology because it was a first for her. &quot;It was a blue room. Blue walls, blue roof. It was just blue, blue, blue&quot;, Foster explained. &quot;And I was rotated on a Lazy Susan with the camera moving on a computerized arm. It was really tough.&quot;

News footage of then-President Bill Clinton was digitally altered to make it appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of &quot;The Jackal&quot;. Shortly after Poitier&#x27;s refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. &quot;Clinton gave his Mars rock speech&quot;, the director explained, &quot;and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line &#x27;We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say&#x27;, I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open.&quot;

One notable feature of &quot;Contact&quot; is its use of digital color correction. This approach helped solve continuity errors during the location shooting at the Very Large Array in New Mexico. &quot;The weather killed us, so we were going back in and changing it enough so that the skies and colors and times of day all seem roughly the same&quot;, commented visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston.

The opening scene is a five-minute CGI sequence, beginning with a view of Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio broadcasts emitting from the planet. The camera starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie&#x27;s eye as she is listening on her amateur radio base station. The scale-view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film &quot;Powers of Ten&quot; (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated sequence in a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening of &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004).

One sequence, with young Ellie running upstairs to try to retrieve her father&#x27;s medicine, appears to have Ellie running just behind a camera as they move into the bathroom, but the shot resolves to show that this was part of the medicine cabinet mirror&#x27;s reflection, pulling back to have Ellie open it. It is noted as one of the film&#x27;s most impressive visual effects due to the seamlessness of the transition. According to Carin-Anne Strohmaier, first assistant film editor, the shot was created through three different plates and digitally manipulated in CGI to create the effect: one plate was from the cameraman leading Ellie, the second of Ellie opening the cabinet door (which was a blue screen instead of a mirror), and the third of the reflection of the photograph of Ellie and her dad when the door closes.

In the sequence with the death of Ellie&#x27;s father, they planned to use an effect similar to bullet time from &quot;The Matrix&quot; to show him stopped in time as he died. As the movie was filmed, they found the approach did not fit the casting or the direction the film was going. They decided it would be most effective to create something distressing but with Ellie&#x27;s father absent from the shot, leading to the development of the mirror sequence.

The decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. It was Zemeckis&#x27;s and Ralston&#x27;s sixth film collaboration. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effect shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital graphics. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis said, &quot;The Machine in Sagan&#x27;s novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you&#x27;re going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable... It had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real.&quot; The machine was designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a &quot;time-displacement device&quot; for an unused scene in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;.

Early conceptual designs of the Pod were based, as in the novel, on one of the primary shapes in geometry: a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided body. Eventually it was modified to a spherical capsule that encased the traveler, with a dodecahedron surrounding the sphere. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials gave them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the Space Shuttle, where they studied the mechanics of the elevator, gantry area and loading arm for the design of the Machine&#x27;s surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers&#x27; approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod, elevator interior and gantry, which took almost four months. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.

The climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that &quot;the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream.&quot; To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway&#x27;s mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied. The Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation.

===Music===
The original score was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri, most of which was released on August 19, 1997, by Warner Bros. Records. The full score is approximately an hour long, 44 minutes of which is on the CD, including every major cue. The CD track entitled &quot;Good to Go&quot; features a slightly different opening—a brief brass motif that is not in the film—but all other cues are identical in orchestration to the mix in the film.

The Region 2 Special Edition DVD release contains a 5.1 music score track, which presents the complete score (this feature, as with many isolated scores, is not mentioned in most product descriptions of the DVD).

==Themes==
&quot;Contact&quot; often suggests that cultural conflicts between religion and science would be brought to the fore by the apparent contact with aliens that occurs in the film. A point of discussion is the existence of God, with several different positions being portrayed. A description of an emotionally intense experience by Palmer Joss, which he describes as seeing God, is met by Arroway&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;some part of [him] needed to have it&quot;—that it was a significant personal experience but indicative of nothing greater. Joss compares his certainty that God exists to Arroway&#x27;s certainty that she loved her deceased father, despite her being unable to prove it.

&quot;Contact&quot; depicts intense debate occurring as a result of the apparent contact with aliens. Many clips of well-known debate shows such as &quot;Crossfire&quot; and &quot;Larry King Live&quot; are shown, with participants discussing the implications of the message, asking whether it is proof of the existence of alien life or of God, and whether science is encroaching upon religious ground by, as one believer puts it, &quot;talking to your god for you&quot;. The head of a religious organization casts doubt on the morality of building the machine, noting: &quot;We don&#x27;t even know whether [the aliens] believe in God.&quot; The first machine is ultimately destroyed by a Christian extremist, in the belief that building it was detrimental to humankind.

Although the revelation at the end of the film that Arroway&#x27;s recording device recorded approximately 18 hours of noise is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of—if not the experience of—her &quot;journey&quot;, several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Zemeckis said: &quot;The point of the movie is for there always to be a certain amount of doubt [as to whether the aliens were real].&quot; These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the &quot;journey&quot; that echo Ellie&#x27;s experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens &quot;downloading [her] thoughts and memories&quot;), but the timing of the message&#x27;s arrival and its eventual decoding are also coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S. R. Hadden (Arroway&#x27;s only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA.

At the end of the film, Arroway is put into a position that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.

Zemeckis stated that he intended the message of the film to be that science and religion can coexist rather than being opposing camps, as shown by the coupling of scientist Arroway with the religious Joss, as well as his acceptance that the &quot;journey&quot; indeed took place. This, and scattered references throughout the film, posit that science and religion are not nominally incompatible: one interviewer, after asking Arroway whether the construction of the machine—despite not knowing what will happen when it is activated—is too dangerous, suggests that it is being built on the &quot;faith&quot; that the alien designers, as Arroway puts it, &quot;know what they&#x27;re doing&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Contact&quot;″s release in July 1997 rekindled public interest in Sagan&#x27;s 1985 novel. The book remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list from July 27 to September 21, 1997.

&quot;Contact&quot; premiered on July 1, 1997, at the Village Theater in Los Angeles, California. It was released in the United States and Canada on July 11, 1997, in 1,923 theaters, earning $20,584,908 in its opening weekend, ranking in second place behind &quot;Men in Black&quot;. It eventually grossed $100,920,329 in North America and $70,200,000 in foreign countries, reaching a worldwide total of $171,120,329.

&quot;Contact&quot; was released on LaserDisc, VHS and DVD in December 1997. Among the special features are three audio commentaries: by director Zemeckis and producer Starkey, by visual effects supervisors Ken Ralston and Stephen Rosenbaum, and by star Jodie Foster. &quot;Contact&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc on October 6, 2009.

== Critical reception ==
On the basis of 68 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 68% of critics gave positive reviews, with an average score of 6.9/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Contact&quot; elucidates stirring scientific concepts and theological inquiry at the expense of satisfying storytelling, making for a brainy blockbuster that engages with its ideas, if not its characters.&quot; Metacritic calculated an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 23 reviews, denoting &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, said that &quot;Sagan&#x27;s novel &quot;Contact&quot; provides the inspiration for Robert Zemeckis&#x27; new film, which tells the smartest and most absorbing story about extraterrestrial intelligence since &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). &quot;Movies like &quot;Contact&quot; help explain why movies like &quot;Independence Day&quot; leave me feeling empty and unsatisfied&quot;, Ebert commented. On December 21, 2011, Ebert added &quot;Contact&quot; to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; collection.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the film carried a more philosophical portrait of the science fiction genre than did other films, but still managed &quot;to satisfy the cravings of the general public who simply want to be entertained&quot;. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli said that &quot;Contact&quot; is &quot;one of 1997&#x27;s finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making magic&quot;. Berardinelli likened its awe and spectacle to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, while adding that &quot;If &quot;Contact&quot; falls short in any area, it&#x27;s an inability to fully develop all of its many subplots...&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; largely enjoyed the first 90 minutes of &quot;Contact&quot; but felt that Zemeckis was too obsessed with visual effects rather than cohesive storytelling for the pivotal climax. Rita Kempley, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, did not like the film&#x27;s premise, which she described as &quot;a preachy debate between sanctity and science&quot;.

==Reactions==
===Bill Clinton===
In 1984, a meteorite called Allan Hills 84001, thought to be from Mars, was found in Antarctica. Twelve years later, an article by NASA scientist David S. McKay was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, proposing that the meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria (later, a disputed interpretation). The announcement made headlines around the world, and the following day, on August 7, 1996, during a press conference about the news, the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made remarks that were in places sufficiently generic in nature to allow fragments of his videotaped statement to be included in &quot;Contact&quot;, implying that Clinton was ostensibly speaking about contact with extraterrestrial life, congruent with the film&#x27;s story:

Later in the film, a separate fragment of generic remarks by President Clinton, speaking about Saddam Hussein and Iraq at a different press conference in October 1994, was lifted out of context and inserted into &quot;Contact&quot;:

On July 14, 1997, three days after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. received a letter from White House Counsel Charles Ruff protesting against the use of Clinton&#x27;s digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands, but called the duration and manner of Clinton&#x27;s appearance &quot;inappropriate&quot;. No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel simply wanted to send a message to Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the President&#x27;s image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy &quot;prohibits the use of the President in any way ... (that) implies a direct ... connection between the President and a commercial product or service&quot;.

A Warner Bros. spokeswoman explained: &quot;We feel we have been completely frank and upfront with the White House on this issue. They saw scripts, they were notified when the film was completed, they were sent a print well in advance of the film&#x27;s July 11 opening, and we have confirmation that a print was received there July 2.&quot; However, Warner Bros. did concede that they never pursued or received formal release from the White House for the use of Clinton&#x27;s image. While the Counsel commented that parody and satire are protected under the First Amendment, press secretary Mike McCurry believed that &quot;there is a difference when the President&#x27;s image, which is his alone to control, is used in a way that would lead the viewer to believe he has said something he really didn&#x27;t say&quot;.

===CNN===
Shortly after the White House&#x27;s complaint, CNN chairman, president, and CEO Tom Johnson announced he believed that in hindsight it was a mistake to allow 13 members of CNN&#x27;s on-air staff (including John Holliman, Larry King and Bernard Shaw) to appear in the film, even though both CNN and Warner Bros. were owned by Time Warner. Johnson added that, for &quot;Contact&quot;, the CNN presence &quot;creates the impression that we&#x27;re manipulated by Time Warner, and it blurs the line&quot;. CNN then changed their policies for future films, which now require potential appearances to be cleared through their ethics group.

===NASA===
The scene where the NASA scientists give Arroway the &quot;cyanide pill&quot; caused some controversy during production and when the film came out. Gerald D. Griffin, the film&#x27;s NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill &quot;just in case&quot;, and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all they would have to do is cut off their oxygen supply. However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills, and they did it for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie, as it seemed more suspenseful that way, and it was also in line with Sagan&#x27;s beliefs and vision of the film. Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a cameo in the role of &quot;Dynamics&quot; in Mission Control. He was a technical advisor for Ron Howard&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. While working for NASA during the Apollo Program, he was a flight director for that mission, among others, and in the 1980s was director of the Johnson Space Center.

===SETI===
SETI.org published a review of the film in 2011, where they gave a side-by-side chart of a few relevant details from the film, and how they differed from reality. One example being that, despite having 27 radio telescopes, the VLA is actually smaller and less sensitive than the Arecibo Observatory—making Arecibo a better location for SETI work, if possibly a less photogenic filming location than the VLA. Despite these small inconsistencies, they maintained that &quot;&quot;Contact&quot; is indescribably more accurate in its depiction of SETI than any Hollywood film in history.&quot;

==Lawsuits==
Director George Miller, who had developed &quot;Contact&quot; with Warner Bros. before Zemeckis&#x27; hiring, unsuccessfully sued the studio over breach of contract policies.

During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the previous week. Coppola claimed that Sagan&#x27;s novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled &quot;First Contact&quot;. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with American Zoetrope and the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published &quot;Contact&quot;, and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.

In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres dismissed Coppola&#x27;s claim. Although Torres agreed that Sagan violated some terms of the contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, taking it to the California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola&#x27;s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over &quot;Contact&quot;.

<text>Stanisław Leśniewski (; 30 March 1886 – 13 May 1939) was a Polish mathematician, philosopher and logician. A professor of mathematics at the University of Warsaw, he was a leading representative of the Lwów–Warsaw School of Logic and is known for coining and introducing the concept of mereology as part of a comprehensive framework for logic and mathematics.

==Life==
Leśniewski was born on 28 March 1886 at Serpukhov, near Moscow, to father Izydor, an engineer working on the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and mother Helena (&quot;née&quot; Palczewska). Leśniewski went to a high school in Irkutsk. Later he attended lectures by Hans Cornelius at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and lectures by Wacław Sierpiński at Lviv University.

Leśniewski belonged to the first generation of the Lwów–Warsaw School of logic founded by Kazimierz Twardowski. Together with Alfred Tarski and Jan Łukasiewicz, he formed a trio which made the University of Warsaw, during the interbellum, perhaps the most important research center in the world for formal logic. Despite that, Leśniewski&#x27;s growing anti-semitism later caused the deterioration of the relationship with Tarski.

His main contribution was the construction of three nested formal systems, to which he gave the Greek-derived names of protothetic, ontology, and mereology. (&quot;Calculus of names&quot; is sometimes used instead of ontology, a term widely employed in metaphysics in a very different sense.) A good textbook presentation of these systems is that by Simons (1987), who compares and contrasts them with the variants of mereology, more popular nowadays, descending from the &quot;calculus of individuals&quot; of Leonard and Goodman. Simons clarifies something that is very difficult to determine by reading Leśniewski and his students, namely that Polish mereology is a first-order theory equivalent to what is now called classical extensional mereology (modulo choice of language).

While he did publish a fair body of work (Leśniewski, 1992, is his collected works in English translation), some of it in German, the leading language for mathematics of his day, his writings had limited impact because of their enigmatic style and highly idiosyncratic notation. Leśniewski was also a radical nominalist: he rejected axiomatic set theory at a time when that theory was in full flower. He pointed to Russell&#x27;s paradox and the like in support of his rejection, and devised his three formal systems as a concrete alternative to set theory. Even though Alfred Tarski was his sole doctoral pupil, Leśniewski nevertheless strongly influenced an entire generation of Polish logicians and mathematicians via his teaching at the University of Warsaw. It is mainly thanks to the writings of his students (e.g., Srzednicki and Rickey 1984) that Leśniewski&#x27;s thought is known.

During the Polish–Soviet War of 1919-21, Leśniewski served the cause of Poland&#x27;s independence by breaking Soviet Russian ciphers for the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau.

Leśniewski died suddenly of cancer, shortly before the German invasion of Poland, which resulted in the destruction of his &quot;Nachlass&quot;. He was buried at Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery.

<doc id="422272" wikidata="Q699617" url="?curid=422272" title="Ian Hamilton (British Army officer)">
<text>General Sir Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton, (16 January 1853 – 12 October 1947) was a senior British Army officer who had an extensive British Imperial military career in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Hamilton was twice recommended for the Victoria Cross, but on the first occasion was considered too young, and on the second too senior. He was wounded in action at the Battle of Majuba during the First Boer War, which rendered his left hand permanently injured. Near the end of his career, he commanded the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Corfu, United States of the Ionian Islands on January 16, 1853. His father was Colonel Christian Monteith Hamilton, former commanding officer of the 92nd Highlanders. His mother Corinna was the daughter of the 3rd Viscount Gort. His mother died giving birth to his brother, Vereker, who became a well-known artist. Hamilton received his early formal education at Wellington College, Berkshire. His father then sent him to stay with General Drammers, a Hanoverian who had fought against Prussia.

==Military career==
Hamilton attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1869, the first year that entrance to the British Army as an officer was regulated by academic examination rather than by the monetary purchasing of a commission. In 1871 he received a commission as an infantry officer with the Suffolk Regiment, but shortly afterwards transferred to the 2nd Battalion of The Gordon Highlanders, who at that time were on Imperial garrison service in India. On arrival in India Hamilton took part in the Afghan campaign.

During the First Boer War he was present at the Battle of Majuba, where he was wounded and taken prisoner of war by the Boers. He later returned to England to recover, where he was treated as a war hero and introduced to Queen Victoria. In 1882 he was made captain and took part in the Nile Expedition of 1884–1885, being promoted to brevet-major. In Burma 1886–1887 he became brevet lieutenant colonel. In Bengal from 1890 to 1893 held the rank of Colonel and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1891. He took part in the Chitral Expedition as military secretary to Sir George Stuart White, commander in chief of forces in India. From 1895 to 1898 he held the post of Deputy Quarter Master General in India. In 1897–1898 he commanded the third brigade in the Tirah Campaign, where his left arm was wounded by a shell.

He returned to England in April 1898 and was appointed Commandant of the School of Musketry at Hythe.

===Second Boer War===
Amidst mounting tensions between the United Kingdom and the Boer republics in South Africa Lieutenant General White was dispatched to take command in Natal in September 1899, with Hamilton accompanying him as Chief Staff Officer (Assistant Adjutant General). The Second Boer War broke out shortly after their arrival and Hamilton commanded the infantry at the Battle of Elandslaagte. At the Battle of Ladysmith Hamilton continued to lead his brigade-sized column, but played no role in the fighting. Defeated in the field, White&#x27;s Natal Field Force was besieged in Ladysmith from the beginning of November. Hamilton was given command of the southern sector of the town&#x27;s defences and successfully fought off the only major assault on the garrison at the Battle of Wagon Hill in January. For his part in the siege, he was frequently mentioned in despatches.

After the relief of Ladysmith in February Hamilton took command of a brigade of Mounted Infantry, and from April the Mounted Infantry Division. He was promoted to major general, and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). The war correspondent Winston Churchill told of his campaign from Bloemfontein to Pretoria in &quot;Ian Hamilton&#x27;s March&quot; (London, 1900, reprinted as the second half of &quot;The Boer War&quot;), having first met Hamilton in 1897 when they sailed on the same ship. Hamilton travelled 400 miles from Bloemfontein to Pretoria fighting 10 major battles with Boer forces (including the battle of Rooiwal) and fourteen minor ones, and was recommended twice for the Victoria Cross (which was considered inappropriate because of his rank).

In May 1901 Hamilton was appointed Military Secretary at the War Office, but the following November he was again asked to return to South Africa as Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Kitchener. He arrived in South Africa in late November 1901, and received the local rank of lieutenant general. In April 1902 he took command of the military columns operating in the Western Transvaal. Following the end of hostilities in June 1902, he returned to the UK together with Lord Kitchener on board the &quot;SS Orotava&quot;, which arrived in Southampton on 12 July. They received an enthusiastic welcome on their arrival to London, with thousands of people lining the streets to watch their procession.

In a despatch dated 23 June 1902, Lord Kitchener wrote the following about his work in South Africa:
Hamilton was promoted to lieutenant general for distinguished service in the field on 22 August 1902. He returned to his post as Military Secretary at the War Office in September 1902, and the same month accompanied Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and St John Brodrick, Secretary of State for War, on a visit to Germany to attend the German army maneuvers as guest of the Emperor Wilhelm. From 1903 to 1904 he was Quartermaster-General to the Forces.

===Japan===
From 1904 to 1905, Hamilton was the military attaché of the British Indian Army serving with the Japanese army in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War. Amongst the several military attachés from Western countries, he was the first to arrive in Japan after the start of the war. He published &quot;A Staff Officer&#x27;s Scrap-Book during the Russo–Japanese War&quot; on his experiences and observations during that conflict.

This military confrontation between a well-known European army and a less-familiar Asian army was the first time that the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry were defended with machine guns and artillery. This was the first twentieth-century war in which the technology of warfare became increasingly important, factors which came to dominate the evolution of warfare during the First World War. Hamilton wrote that cavalry was obsolete in such a conflict, regarding their role as better accomplished by mounted infantry. He became a supporter of non-traditional tactics such as night attacks and the use of aircraft. Conversely, the successful Japanese infantry assaults convinced him that superior morale would allow an attacker to overcome prepared defensive positions.

==Return to England and Inspector-General of Overseas Forces==
Hamilton went on to serve as General Officer Commanding Southern Command between 1905 and 1909 and as Adjutant-General to the Forces between 1909 and 1910. In October 1907, while GOC-in-C Southern Command, he was promoted to general.

By 1911 Hamilton had been appointed Inspector-General of Overseas Forces, and by 1913 also, additionally, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Mediterranean Command, with major-generals in Gibraltar, Malta, and Egypt, plus the forces in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Cyprus seemingly reporting to him. In July 1914 he was returning to the United Kingdom with his appointment about to expire.

==First World War==
On 5 August 1914, with the declaration of hostilities between Britain and Germany, Hamilton was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief, Home Army. He also became commander of &quot;Central Force&quot;, the predominantly Territorial Force military formation which was charged with repelling any seaborne German invasion of the east coast of England in the early part of the war.

===Gallipoli campaign===


In March 1915, Lord Kitchener appointed Hamilton, aged 62, to the command of the Allied Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, with orders to gain control of the Dardanelles straits from the Ottoman Empire and to capture Constantinople. While a senior and respected officer, perhaps more experienced in different campaigns than most, Hamilton was considered too unconventional, too intellectual, and too friendly with politicians to be given a command on the Western Front. Hamilton was not given a chance to take part in planning the campaign. Intelligence reports on the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s military defensive capacity were poor and underestimated its strength. While the high command of the Greek Army, which possessed far more detailed knowledge of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s military capacity, warned Kitchener that a British Expeditionary Force entering the Eastern Mediterranean theatre would require 150,000 troops to capture Gallipoli, Kitchener concluded that a force of 70,000 men would be adequate to overpower any defensive garrison there.

The plan to take control of the Dardanelles and open a new front in the war had been considered in various forms since 1914. In November of that year, ships from the Royal Navy had shelled its outer forts, causing the magazine at Seddülbahir castle to explode. In December 1914, a Royal Navy submarine entered the channel and sank the Turkish warship &quot;Mesudiye&quot; at Çanakkale. These early experiences raised in Kitchener&#x27;s mind the prospect of an easy victory for a more ambitious operation, but as a consequence of them, the Turks had set about laying sea-mines in the straits to interdict Allied ships approaching again and strengthened the forts guarding its approaches. On 3 January 1915, the British First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, presented a plan to the British Government for a joint naval and army attack, utilizing 75,000 troops, but only on the proviso that it could be launched with little delay. By 21 January 1915, Fisher wrote privately to Admiral Jellicoe that he could not approve the plan unless 200,000 men were available to carry it through. Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had initially suggested in September 1914 that the operation would need the support of only 50,000 men, a strength of just over two British Army divisions.

Starting on 19 February 1915, British and French warships attempted to take the strait using naval power alone but failed after an abortive attack foundered upon sea mines. Lord Kitchener then decided that an invasion by troops of the Gallipoli peninsula would be required to support the naval operation with a land campaign, led by Hamilton, who became responsible for organising landings there. Hamilton had no specialised landing craft, the disparate troops he had been given had no training for seaborne operations, and supplies for the army had been packed in ways which made them difficult to access for landings. Hamilton believed that the Royal Navy would make further attacks during his campaign; realising its likely losses, however, and fundamentally opposing the idea that tactical losses of its ships in the operation was an acceptable price to pay, the Royal Naval high command declined to mount another attack.

With the Gallipoli Campaign stalled, Hamilton was recalled to London on 16 October 1915, effectively ending his military career.

==Later life==
In retirement, Hamilton was a leading figure in the ex-servicemen organization, the British Legion, holding the position of Scottish President. He was also a founding member and vice-president of the Anglo-German Association in 1928, which worked to promote rapprochement between Britain and Germany. He maintained a relationship with the Association after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, described himself as &quot;an admirer of the great Adolph Hitler&quot;, and dismissed &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; as a &quot;youthful excess&quot;. (In the historian Ian Kershaw&#x27;s view, however, Hamilton was a pillar of the British Imperial power establishment and not a Nazi supporter, despite his early apparent approval for much of what the early manifestation of Nazi Germany proclaimed). In 1934, at the age of 81, Hamilton was filmed as part of a war documentary film called &quot;Forgotten Men&quot;.
==Gordon drums==
In October 1914, during WWI, the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders landed in Ostend, Belgium, and was transported to the front. They took with them their pipes but the bulky drums were left in Ostend, under the care of the police, because the transport wagons were &quot;overloaded.&quot; After Ostend fell to the Germans, the drums were taken to the Armoury Museum in Berlin as a &quot;war trophy.&quot; Twenty years later, in 1934, Hamilton, the Regiment&#x27;s colonel, wrote to Germany&#x27;s president Marshall von Hindenburg requesting the return of the seven drums and von Hindenburg &quot;immediately&quot; agreed. Hamilton traveled personally to the German capital and received the Gordon drums in a ceremony in which he spoke of his wish that there will be &quot;no more war&quot; between the &quot;old allies of Waterloo.&quot;

==Death==
Hamilton died on 12 October 1947, aged 94, at his home at Hyde Park Gardens in London. His body was buried at Kilmadock Cemetery, in Doune, Stirlingshire, Scotland. In 2013, his grave was found to have fallen into a semi-derelict condition, and it was refurbished by Stirling Council.

==Personal life==

Hamilton spoke German, French and Hindi, and was considered charming, courtly and kind. He appeared frail yet was full of energy.

In 1887 he married Jean Muir, the daughter of a Glasgow businessman. They originally had no intention of starting a family, but adopted two children after the War.

Along with his professional career, Hamilton was a prolific writer. He published a volume of poetry and a novel contemporarily described as risqué. Examples of his written works include: &quot;The Fighting of the Future&quot;, &quot;Icarus&quot;, &quot;A Jaunt on a Junk&quot;, &quot;A Ballad of Hadji&quot;, and &quot;A Staff Officer&#x27;s Scrapbook&quot;. In the introduction to his &quot;Gallipoli Diary&quot;, he stated: &quot;There is nothing certain about war, except that one side won&#x27;t win&quot;.

He was a cousin of the diarist James Lees-Milne.

==Assessments==
British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith remarked that he thought that Hamilton had &quot;too much feather in his brain&quot;, whereas Charles Bean, a war correspondent who had reported from the scene of the Gallipoli campaign in 1915 and who went on to write Australia&#x27;s Official History of the 1914–1918 War, considered that Hamilton possessed &quot;a breadth of mind which the army in general does not possess&quot;. Writing in his &#x27;Gallipoli Memories&#x27;, Sir Compton Mackenzie makes it clear that his view was aligned with that of Charles Bean.

== Honours, awards and decorations ==
Hamilton received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

A statue of the then Lt.-Gen Hamilton stands on the Boer War memorial in Cheltenham.

<doc id="422277" wikidata="Q501638" url="?curid=422277" title="Shirakami-Sanchi">
<text>is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Tōhoku region of northern Honshū, Japan. This mountainous area includes the last virgin forest of Siebold&#x27;s beech which once covered most of northern Japan. The area straddles both Akita and Aomori Prefectures. Of the entire , a tract covering was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in 1993. Fauna found in the area includes Japanese black bear, the Japanese serow, Japanese macaque and 87 species of birds. The Shirakami-Sanchi was one of the first sites entered on the World Heritage List in Japan, along with Yakushima, Himeji Castle, and &quot;Buddhist Monuments in the Hōryū-ji Area&quot; in 1993. Permission is needed from Forest Management to enter the heart of the Shirakami-Sanchi.

==Location==
Shirakami-Sanchi is a wilderness area covering one third of Shirakami mountain range. It has the largest remaining virgin beech forest in East Asia, and is a remnant of the cool-temperate beech forests that have covered the hills and mountain slopes of northern Japan since eight to twelve thousand years ago. The area has an altitude ranging from to above sea level. Beech forests are distributed across North America, Europe, and East Asia, and are thought to have originated from circumpolar vegetation prior to the Last glacial period. The location near the Sea of Japan is characterised by a distinct heavy-snow environment, enabling the area to retain a complete ecosystem of stable climax beech forest, which has disappeared from most of the world

The World Heritage Site is located within the boundaries of multiple municipalities Ajigasawa, Fujisato, Fukaura, and Nishimeya. The Anmon no Taki waterfalls are in the western part of Nishimeya, about to the west of Miyama Lake.

==Highlights==
===Primeval beech forest===
Apart from beech trees, &quot;Katsura, Kalopanax&quot;, Japanese Hop-hornbeam and other species of tall deciduous trees are found in the forest. Planted forests of timber trees, such as Japanese cedar, have replaced many of the beech forests in northern Japan; however, within the borders of the Shirakami-Sanchi unmodified beech forests are densely and continuously distributed. The area is largely a wilderness with no roads, trails or man-made facilities. The beech tree is usually unsuitable for cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. Therefore, beech forests have never been disturbed by shiitake farmers and remain in a state of preservation much greater than that of surrounding forests. Further to the strict legal protections, almost no logging of beech trees has been carried out due to lack of access and the rugged terrain. Also, tourism activities are limited mainly to the areas near the boundary.

The Shirakami-Sanchi region also contain large areas of forest not covered by the World Heritage listing, and the level of preservation in these areas is not as high as in the central listed area.

While the biodiversity of Earth&#x27;s primeval beech forests faced a substantial reduction around 2 million years ago due to continental glaciation, the forests in northern Japan, notably, were spared from this impact. As a result, these forests have retained their original ecological composition, serving as living time capsules of historical significance.

===Anmon no taki (Shadow Gate Falls)===
These triple falls in the World Heritage Site also fall within the borders of the Akaishi Keiryū Anmon no Taki Prefectural Natural Park, and are easily accessible on foot.

===Animals===
*Black woodpecker (natural monument)
*Japanese serow (a type of goat antelope) (natural monument)
*Mountain hawk-eagle
*Golden eagle
*Japanese macaque
*Dormouse
*Asiatic black bear

===Tsugaru Quasi-National Park===
Shirakami-Sanchi is bordered on the east by Tsugaru Quasi-National Park.

===Shirakami-dake===
Shirakami-dake is the highest peak in Shirakami-Sanchi. It is in height. The peak itself is not a part of the World Heritage Site and, as such, permission is not necessary to climb. The summit is equipped with toilet and shelter facilities.

===Yūkyū-no-Mori (悠久の杜) Shirakami festival===
At the foot of the Shirakami-Sanchi, the town of Hachimori in the Yamamoto District of Akita prefecture holds an annual concert in the open air.

<text>Wing Commander Guy Penrose Gibson, (12 August 1918 – 19 September 1944) was a distinguished bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He was the first Commanding Officer of No. 617 Squadron, which he led in the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; raid in 1943, resulting in the breaching of two large dams in the Ruhr area of Germany. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, in the aftermath of the raid in May 1943 and became the most highly decorated British serviceman at that time. He completed over 170 war operations before being killed in action at the age of 26.
==Early life and education==
Gibson was born in Simla, British India, on 12 August 1918, the son of Alexander James Gibson and his wife Leonora (Nora) Mary Gibson. At the time of Gibson&#x27;s birth, his father was an officer in the Imperial Indian Forestry Service, becoming the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Simla Hill States in 1922. In 1924, when he was six, his parents separated. His mother was granted custody of Gibson, his elder brother Alexander (&quot;Alick&quot;) and sister Joan, and decided to return to England.

As her family came from Porthleven, Cornwall, Nora Gibson settled first in Penzance. Gibson started school in England at the same school as his sister, West Cornwall College. His mother then moved to London and he was sent as a boarder to Earl&#x27;s Avenue School, a preparatory school, later known as St George&#x27;s, in Folkestone, Kent.

In 1932 Gibson started at St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford, the same school as Douglas Bader where he was also placed in the same house, Cowell&#x27;s. Gibson&#x27;s housemaster was A. F. &quot;Freddie&quot; Yorke who became Gibson&#x27;s guardian.

Following her return from India, Gibson&#x27;s mother developed a drinking problem which escalated into alcoholism. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic and sometimes violent towards her children. The school organised lodgings for Gibson and his brother during the school holidays. Nora&#x27;s younger sister, Mrs Beatrice (&quot;Gwennie&quot;) Christopher, gave Gibson his own room at her house. Her husband, John, helped Nora out with school fees. They also both attended some school functions to support their nephews.

Gibson was an average student academically and played for the Rugby Second XV. His interests included science and photography. At one stage as a teenager, he seems to have become interested and quite expert in the workings of cinema organs. He read all kinds of books, especially the Arthurian legends and Shakespeare. His favourite play was &quot;Henry V&quot;. He was made a house prefect.

From an early age Gibson wanted to fly. He had a picture of his boyhood hero, Albert Ball VC, the First World War flying ace, on his bedroom wall at his aunt&#x27;s house. His ambition was to become a civilian test pilot. He wrote for advice to Vickers, receiving a reply from their chief test pilot, Captain Joseph &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers, who wrote that Gibson should first learn to fly by joining the RAF on a short service commission. Gibson applied to the RAF, but was rejected when he failed the Medical Board; the probable reason that his legs were too short. His later application was successful, and his personal file included the remark &quot;satisfactory leg length test carried out&quot;. He commenced a short service commission in November 1936.

==Initial military service==
===Initial military training===
Gibson commenced his flying training on 16 November 1936 at the Bristol Flying School, Yatesbury, with No. 6 Flying Training Course and with civilian instructors. Owing to poor weather the course did not conclude until 1 January 1937. After some leave, he then moved to No. 24 (Training) Group at RAF Uxbridge for his RAF basic training. He was commissioned with the rank of acting pilot officer with effect from 31 January 1937. He then underwent further flying training as a member of the junior section of No. 5 Flying Training Course at No. 6 Flying Training School RAF, RAF Netheravon. He was awarded his pilot&#x27;s wings on 24 May 1937.

As part of the Advanced Training Squadron, during summer 1937, he participated in further training at No. 3 Armament Training Station, Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire. He opted for bombers as these gave experience in multi-engined planes, this being typical for individuals planning on a civilian flying career. He returned to Netheravon and graduated on 31 August 1937. He passed all his ground exams first time, with an average of 77.29% and a flying rating of &quot;average&quot;. However, his rating as a companion was below average owing to his sometimes rude and condescending behaviour towards junior ranks and ground crews in particular.

===No. 83 (Bomber) Squadron===
Gibson&#x27;s initial posting was to No. 83 (Bomber) Squadron, stationed at RAF Turnhouse, west of Edinburgh. He was assigned to &#x27;A&#x27; Flight and was placed under the supervision of Pilot Officer Anthony &quot;Oscar&quot; Bridgman. The squadron was flying Hawker Hinds. He joined a settled group of officers from similar minor public school backgrounds. As some stayed with the squadron for a few years, promotion was slow. He was promoted to pilot officer on 16 November 1937. His behaviour towards the ground crews continued to be perceived as unsatisfactory and they gave him the nickname the &quot;Bumptious Bastard&quot;.

In March 1938, the squadron was transferred from No. 2 Group to No. 5 Group and relocated to RAF Scampton. In June they moved to RAF Leuchars for an armaments training camp. From October the squadron started their conversion to the Handley Page Hampden, which was completed by January 1939. At a Court of Inquiry in October 1938, Gibson was found guilty of negligence after a taxiing incident at RAF Hemswell. He spent Christmas Day 1938 in hospital at RAF Rauceby with chickenpox. He was then sent on convalescent leave, returning to the squadron in late January.

In Spring 1939 the squadron took part in an armaments training camp at RAF Evanton near Invergordon in Scotland. With the likelihood of war increasing and as part of a plan to improve standards, Gibson was sent on a navigation course at Hamble near Southampton. He did not appear to take the course seriously, but passed with an average mark. The instructor added the comment &quot;could do well&quot;. He was due to leave the RAF, but was retained owing to the outbreak of hostilities in Abyssinia. In June he was promoted to flying officer. On 25 July the squadron made a long-distance flight to the south of France. They participated in Home Defence exercises over London in August. He then went on his summer leave. At this stage of his career, he had never flown or landed a plane at night.

==Second World War==

===First operational tour: No. 83 Squadron, Bomber Command===
Gibson was recalled from leave back to Scampton by telegram on 31 August 1939. Gibson flew on 3 September 1939, two days after the start of the Second World War. He was one of the pilots selected to attack the German fleet, which was near Wilhelmshaven. He took off at 18:15. The operation was aborted owing to bad weather and he landed back at Scampton around 23:00. On 5 September while in the Mess, he was bitten by a dog. His arm was put in a sling and he was granted 36 hours leave. This allowed him to attend his brother&#x27;s wedding in Rugby, where he was Alick&#x27;s best man. On his return, the squadron had moved to Ringway near Manchester under the Scatter Scheme. They were there for 10 days. The squadron did not fly on another operation until December, during the Phoney War.

In February 1940, Gibson was one of the members of the squadron put on temporary secondment to Coastal Command at RAF Lossiemouth. On 27 February, he participated in an operation that was sent to attack a U-boat. However, owing to various communications problems, one of the aircraft dropped its bombs on a Royal Navy submarine. The senior officers involved with the incident were censured for their failure to bring the squadron up to a satisfactory standard. The squadron then underwent a period of intensive training.

The period from April to September 1940 was one of the most operationally intense periods of Gibson&#x27;s career. He completed 34 operations in 5 months, with 10 in June. The type of operation varied from &quot;gardening&quot; – laying mines in various seaways and harbour entrances – to attacks on capital ships, as well as attacks on ground-based military and economic targets. During this time, he acquired a reputation for being seemingly fearless, particularly as he was willing to fly in marginal weather. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 9 July 1940. He was trained for a low-level attack on the Dortmund-Ems canal, but he missed the actual raid on 12 August. On his return from a raid on Lorient on 27 August, he spotted a Dornier Do 215 and attacked it. He was credited with a &quot;probable&quot; kill. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 3 September 1940. His last operation with the squadron was to Berlin on 23 September 1940. Arthur Harris, then the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No. 5 Group, later described Gibson as the &quot;most full-out fighting pilot&quot; under his command at this time.

As was usual practice, to give pilots a rest from operations, Gibson was posted as a flying instructor to No. 14 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at RAF Cottesmore. He was there for two weeks, part of which was spent on leave, but he did not settle. He was then transferred to No. 16 OTU at RAF Upper Heyford. Meanwhile, Air Marshal Sholto Douglas, Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, and Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC No. 12 (Fighter) Group, made an appeal to Harris for bomber pilots with their night-flying experience to fly night fighters. Gibson volunteered. Harris wrote a letter introducing the pilots, which included the comment &quot;a hand-picked bunch of which Gibson is the best&quot;. Harris agreed to help Gibson&#x27;s career when he had completed this tour with &quot;the best command within my power&quot;.

===Second operational tour: No. 29 Squadron, Fighter Command===
Gibson was ordered to report on 13 November 1940 to No. 29 Squadron as the commander of &#x27;A&#x27; Flight. The squadron was stationed at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire, but flew from a small satellite field at RAF Wellingore about six miles away. The officers&#x27; mess was nearby in The Grange. When he arrived, the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader Charles Widdows, was in the process of rebuilding the squadron following an outbreak of indiscipline that nearly led to its disbandment during July 1940. He was weeding out under-performing pilots and replacing his flight commanders. Gibson attracted some hostility from some longer-standing members of the squadron, because as one of these new flight commanders, he was seen as part of Widdows&#x27; reforms and he had been chosen over an existing member of the squadron. He had also come from a Bomber squadron. The root cause of the low morale was a lack of combat success. The Bristol Blenheim was not designed as a night fighter and the aircraft interception (AI) radar was still in its very early days of development. Also, Widdows was required to split the squadron up with a few pilots each at Ternhill, Kirton and Wittering and with no more than half at Digby at any one time. Gibson flew six operations in Blenheims.

The squadron started to convert to the Bristol Beaufighter I and Widdows personally supervised his pilots during their conversion. Gibson&#x27;s first flight in a Beaufighter was on 1 December 1940. He then undertook some intensive training on AI radar procedure. He found the night-fighter culture very different from bombers as the two-man crew had to work as a team with the pilot relying on the guidance of the AI operator to find their targets. Gibson made his first operational flight in a Beaufighter on 10 December with Sergeant Taylor as his AI operator. That winter saw bad weather and he flew only three operations in the whole of January. He claimed a kill on 12 March, but it was not confirmed. However, his kill on 14 March was confirmed as a Heinkel He 111. He went to Skegness to collect the tail assembly as trophy for the squadron and the crew&#x27;s dinghy for himself. He was attacked by an intruder when landing at Wellingore on 8 April. Gibson was unharmed, but his AI operator, Sergeant Bell, was injured in the leg.

In April, Widdows obtained a transfer for the squadron from 12 to 11 Group and a move to RAF West Malling in Kent. Gibson flew down with him on 25 April to inspect the facilities. The full squadron flew down on 29 April. Gibson was promoted to acting squadron leader towards the end of June 1941 and started to deputise for the commander in his absence. Widdows was promoted to station command and was replaced by Wing Commander Edward Colbeck-Welch. Gibson claimed two more kills which were confirmed. Another unidentified bomber, possibly a Heinkel, was claimed in flames on 3/4 May. On 6 July he downed a Heinkel He 111H-5 of 8/KG4 near Sheerness. His AI radar operator on all his successful claims was Sergeant R.H. James, who was awarded a Distinguished Flying Medal. However, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s bombing offensive was tailing off and Gibson started to become bored by the relative safety, and began to describe patrols as &quot;stooge patrols&quot; in his log book. He made some further interceptions but his guns or cannons failed. He was also concerned by his relative lack of success compared with his fellow flight commander Bob Braham. He seems to have been happy at West Malling and said &quot;Of all the airfields in Great Britain, here, many say, including myself, we have the most pleasant&quot;. His final patrols with the squadron were flown on 15 December. He left with both flying and gunnery ratings of above average. He was awarded a Bar to his DFC.

Again, as a rest from operations, Gibson was due to be posted to an OTU, this time No. 51 OTU, RAF Cranfield as Chief Flying Instructor. By now he had decided he wanted to return to bombers. Despite a visit to HQ No. 5 Group on 15 December to petition for a transfer, Fighter Command insisted he had to go to Cranfield. His opportunity came a few weeks later when on 22 February 1942, Arthur Harris was appointed Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) of Bomber Command. Harris fulfilled his promise made in September 1940. He called Gibson for an interview. On 22 March, Harris wrote to Air Vice Marshal John Slessor, AOC No. 5 Group, explaining his intention to promote Gibson to acting wing commander to put him in command of a Lancaster squadron. Harris suggested No. 207 Squadron. Slessor exercised his discretion and appointed Gibson CO of No. 106 Squadron. Gibson was posted from No. 51 OTU and sent on leave until April, which he spent in south Wales.

===Third operational tour: No. 106 Squadron, Bomber Command===
When the newly promoted Wing Commander Gibson, aged just 23, joined No. 106 Squadron at RAF Coningsby, morale was good, but there was serious disappointment with the new twin-engined Avro Manchester because its Rolls-Royce Vulture engines were unreliable. Therefore, the squadron was scheduled to convert to the four-engined Avro Lancaster, equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines as soon as they became available.

Gibson eased himself back into bomber operational flying with a mine-laying operation in the Baltic on 22 April 1942. and completed three more sorties in the Manchester during the following 3 weeks.

April 1942 was a good month for the squadron. They flew on eighteen nights, six consecutively and the improvements in performance were noted by analysts at both No. 5 Group and Bomber Command. The Lancasters started to arrive during May and an ad hoc training plan was started while normal operations were maintained. Gibson made his first flight in a Lancaster in early May.

As a commander, Gibson&#x27;s main concern was to be seen to share the risk. He continued to show unremitting aggression with a selectivity towards harder targets rather than easier ones. He expected the same determination from everyone on the squadron. He was ruthless in screening crews for reliability. The station&#x27;s Medical Officer became expert in determining which crews were simply unlucky in contrast with genuine malingerers. However he was capable of serious misjudgements on occasions, and could be prone to unreasonable outbursts and the persecution of some crews and their members.

Like Widdows, he carefully supervised new crews and eased them into operational flying with &quot;Nasturtium training&quot; – mine-laying and then easier targets. He was pressured to expose them earlier to greater risks, and acquired a reputation for not accepting any interference in how he ran the squadron.

Gibson&#x27;s exercise of summary discipline tended towards constructive tasks aimed at improving the efficiency of the squadron such as maintenance of aircraft, engines or weapons He was responsible for the emergence of an inner circle of officers who shared his intensity for operations. Their off-duty activities included swimming, water polo and shooting. However, his behaviour towards NCOs and ground crews could still be a problem. Soon after his arrival, the NCOs perceived one incident he was involved in with them as particularly high-handed and the ground crews quickly gave him the nickname &quot;The Boy Emperor&quot;. Gibson got on better with his own class and background than with &quot;other ranks and colonials&quot;. Bomb-aimer George &quot;Johnny&quot; Johnson of Joe McCarthy&#x27;s crew said that on 106 Squadron he was known as the &#x27;Arch-Bastard&#x27; because of his strict discipline, and he did not mix with the lower ranks or talk to NCOs, ground crews or Canadians. A little man, he was arrogant, bombastic and a strict disciplinarian but &quot;had something to be bombastic about&quot; and was a &quot;true leader ... though he never spoke to or even acknowledged me.&quot; In an interview with the RAF Benevolent Fund in 2013 Johnson praised Gibson&#x27;s leadership qualities on the day of the raid though.

On 11 May, Gibson was hospitalised at RAF Rauceby in Lincolnshire. The exact reason is unknown, but suggestions include a sinus or middle ear problem. He was then sent on two weeks convalescent leave. This absence meant he was unable to participate in Operation Millennium, the &quot;1000 Bomber raids&quot;, the first of which was made on Cologne on 30 May 1942. He found this frustrating because this raid saw the introduction of the Bomber stream. This was where the aircraft were concentrated together in an attempt to overwhelm the defences, with each allocated a specific place, height band, and time slot. This period saw the introduction of aiming-point photography. Gibson tried it out and then encouraged all aircrews to become &quot;photo minded&quot;. Obtaining good aiming point photographs quickly became a competition both within, and between squadrons.

On his return he continued to build up his experience with the Lancaster. He flew with his friend, pilot John Hopgood on 4 July and then on a long cross-country flight the day after, 5 July. He made his first operational flight in a Lancaster on 8 July with Dave Shannon as his second pilot. They were together again on 11 July when they went to Danzig. They were appalled when they were sent on a daylight bombing raid to the Krupp Arms Works in Essen on 18 July. It was known as a difficult and dangerous target at night, expected to be much worse in the daytime, and they were relieved to be recalled when near Vlissingen. They jettisoned their bombs over the sea before returning.

The squadron was selected for special training in the use of two kinds of new bombsight for use with a special bomb designed for attacks on capital ships. However, Gibson advised that the aircraft should not attack any ships below 8,500 feet. They put this training into practice with a marathon flight to Gdynia on 27 August 1942. The targets were &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. Gibson again flew with Shannon and they swapped places during the flight. There was significant unexpected haze over the target when they arrived. Gibson&#x27;s bomb aimer, Squadron Leader Richardson, a bombing instructor from RAF Manby, requested twelve practice runs over the target, but they still failed to damage the ship. In fact no ships were damaged during the raid, but the squadron&#x27;s preparation for the raid was noted by Harris and Air Commodore Alec Coryton, the AOC No. 5 Group.

On 30 September the squadron moved from Coningsby to RAF Syerston in Nottinghamshire. They expected this move to be only temporary while the runways were concreted, but problems at Coningsby meant it became permanent.

Gibson quickly formed a good relationship with Syerston&#x27;s station commander Group Captain &quot;Gus&quot; Walker. In October, they were required to conduct low-level training exercises with aircraft flying in formations of threes and sixes. This training was put to use in a raid on the 17th on Le Creusot in France. Gibson and Hopgood were among the pilots sent to attack the electric transformer station at nearby Montchanin. Later in the month they started to attack Italian targets including Genoa, Milan and Turin. In November 1942 Gibson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

On 8 December Gibson did not fly. He was in the control room with Walker watching the aircraft taxiing for take-off. Walker noticed some incendiaries which had fallen out of the bomb bay of a reserve Lancaster located near the main bomb dump. The incendiaries had ignited. Walker drove out to the plane and tried to move the incendiaries with a rake. He lost his arm in the subsequent explosion of the 4000 lb &quot;cookie&quot; bomb still in the aircraft&#x27;s bomb bay. He was replaced by Group Captain Bussell.

On 16 January 1943, Gibson took BBC war correspondent Major Richard Dimbleby on a sortie to Berlin. Dimbleby described the raid in a later radio broadcast. Gibson was very pleased with the outcome, as he always wanted to communicate what life was like for the aircrews. On 12 March, he made his final flight with the squadron to Stuttgart. He flew on three engines and was forced to stay low throughout the raid.

Bussell recommended Gibson for a Bar to his DSO, but this was reduced to a second Bar to his DFC at HQ No. 5 Group owing to the recent award of the DSO. However, Harris confirmed the Bar to Gibson&#x27;s DSO with the comment &quot;any Captain who completes 172 sorties in outstanding manner is worth two DSOs if not a VC. Bar to DSO approved&quot;. Gibson was informed on 25 March, after he left the squadron.

Gibson was expecting to go on leave to Cornwall and was therefore shocked when he received a call from HQ No. 5 Group to inform him he was being posted there to write a book.

==No. 617 Squadron and Operation Chastise==
===Formation of Squadron X===
After the decision was made to attack the Ruhr dams, Harris decided to hand the direct responsibility for the detailed planning, preparation and execution to Air Vice Marshal Ralph Cochrane, AOC No. 5 Group. Harris told him he must form a new squadron and nominated Gibson as the CO.

On 18 March 1943 Gibson attended an interview at HQ No. 5 Group where Cochrane asked him if he was willing to fly on &quot;one more trip&quot;. Gibson indicated that he was. He attended a further interview the following day when he was told that he was to command a new squadron, which would be required to fly low at night with an objective that had to be achieved by 19 May. At this meeting, he was introduced to Group Captain John Whitworth, the commander of RAF Scampton where the new squadron was to be stationed.

====Selection of aircrew====
A circular was sent by 5 Group to all its squadrons, asking them to provide a pilot and crew for a new squadron, for a special one-off operation. No copies of the circular survive, but it would seem to have specified that the crew should be experienced, even perhaps have completed a full tour. Bomber Command then stated they should have completed or nearly completed two tours of operations.

Squadron Leaders Maudslay and Young were appointed as his flight commanders. The selection of Young resulted in the transfer of the whole of &#x27;C&#x27; Flight from No. 57 Squadron into the new one. Some crews or pilots were known to Gibson including Hopgood and Shannon, who by this time had transferred from No. 106 squadron to the Pathfinders and No. 83 Squadron. He selected Harold &quot;Mick&quot; Martin for his low-flying expertise. Of Gibson&#x27;s regular crew from No. 106 Squadron, only Robert Hutchison, the wireless operator, volunteered for this new one. Three more members of his crew came from 50 Squadron, Harlo Taerum, a Canadian navigator, Fred Spafford, an Australian bomb-aimer, and Richard Trevor-Roper, rear gunner. The front gunner was George Deering, another Canadian, and the flight engineer was John Pulford. Although Gibson&#x27;s crew comprised experienced men, in the end some crews had not completed one tour, with some individuals having flown fewer than ten operations.

Gibson was strict in screening the crews during training. That not all the crews were known to him is reflected in how two crews were posted off the squadron as not satisfactory and another crew chose to leave after their navigator was deemed unsatisfactory.

===Training of No. 617 Squadron===
Gibson arrived at Scampton on 21 March. His office was on the 1st floor in No.2 Hangar. His immediate task was to get the general administration organised. He delegated this and the adjutant assigned from No. 57 Squadron was quickly replaced with Flight Lieutenant Humphreys from Syerston. Humphreys was instrumental in the rapid establishment of the squadron. The ground staff started to muster from 21 March and were fully present by 27 March. Flight Sergeant (Discip) Powell inspected them and weeded out those he felt other squadrons had off-loaded. The aircrews started to arrive from 24 March.

On 24 March Gibson travelled to Burhill near Weybridge for his first meeting with Barnes Wallis. Wallis discovered Gibson had not been cleared for a full briefing and therefore could not be told the targets. Wallis was able to explain the design and operation of the new weapon, Upkeep and showed him films from its trials. It was a depth charge which, if rotated with backspin and dropped at the correct speed and altitude, would bounce across the surface of a body of water towards a target. This bouncing behaviour gave it its nickname the bouncing bomb. The crews usually referred to it as a mine.

On 27 March Group Captain Satterley provided Gibson with &quot;most secret&quot; written orders, including a description of the attack and the general plan for the squadron&#x27;s preliminary training. From these Gibson learnt that the targets were &quot;lightly defended special targets&quot; which reduced his suspicion that they were training to attack the Tirpitz. The orders included a list of nine lakes and reservoirs in the Midlands and North Wales, for training flights and target practice. They included Eyebrook Reservoir, near Uppingham, Rutland, Abberton Reservoir near Colchester and Derwent Reservoir in the Peak District. Some of the earliest flights made by the new No. 617 Squadron, were reconnaissance flights over these bodies of water. A recommendation to maximize the training time available was to use simulated night flying as developed by the USAAF. This required the cockpit to be covered in blue celluloid and the pilots and bomb aimers to wear goggles with amber-tinted lenses. Gibson wanted six aeroplanes converted but only two became available, the first on 11 April.
Another important factor was the need for a specially adapted version of the Lancaster, the B.III (Special), officially the &quot;Type 464 (Provisioning)&quot;. The bomb bay doors were removed and the ends of the bay were covered with fairings. Upkeep was suspended on pivoted, vee-shaped struts which sprang apart when the bomb-release button was pressed. A drive belt and pulley to rotate the bomb at 500 rpm was mounted on the starboard strut and driven by a hydraulic motor housed in the forward fairing. The mid-upper turret was removed and a more bulbous bomb aimer&#x27;s blister was fitted. The first adapted aircraft arrived at Scampton on 8 April.
Gibson also had VHF radios (normally reserved for fighters) fitted to the Type 464 Lancasters as he intended to control the operation while over the target, an early example of what became the master bomber role.

On 28 March, Gibson made his first flight to explore the low-flying requirement. He took Hopgood and Young with him and found low flying during daylight satisfactory but during an attempt at dusk the difficulty of their task became apparent, when they nearly ditched. On 29 March, Gibson was shown scale models of the Moehne and Sorpe dams by Cochrane at HQ 5 Group. He then attended a further meeting with Wallis at Weybridge. At this meeting he rejected Wallis&#x27;s proposal of a daylight raid.

The squadron commenced daily flying training at the beginning of April with long cross-country flights with precise turning points to develop their navigation skills. They then started to practise low flying over water. The squadron completed over a thousand flying hours by the end of April and Gibson was able to report to Whitworth, that they could fly pinpoint to pinpoint at low level at night, could bomb using a rangefinder and fly over water at . On 24 April Wallis made a request for the altitude to be reduced to . Gibson reported on 27 April that it was possible and the training was adapted accordingly.

Gibson was closely involved with discussions about the design, trial and approval of the solutions developed for the various technical issues encountered. These included the Dann bomb sight and the &#x27;Spotlight Altimeter Calibrator&#x27;, which was the name given to the spotlights attached to the Lancasters, to ensure the determination of the correct height above a body of water. Security was Gibson&#x27;s constant concern and he was especially displeased to learn from his bombing leader Watson that he had been shown details of the targets within days of his arrival at RAF Manston. Gibson wrote to Cochrane who raised his concerns about this &#x27;criminal&#x27; breach of security at the highest levels.

From the beginning of May squadron training shifted to the tactical aspects of the operation. On 1 May Gibson communicated to Wallis his confidence that the operation would succeed. He repeated this optimism in his weekly report to Whitworth on 4 May where he described the squadron as &quot;ready to operate&quot;. On 6 May he held a conference with the pilots to explain the tactical aspects. They flew a rehearsal that evening with Gibson directing a group by radio telephony (R/T) on the spot over the Eyebrook and Abberton Reservoirs. A second group went to the Derwent Reservoir and a third to the Wash. On 10 May, Satterly sent the draft handwritten operation order to Whitworth for review and revision, to be returned by 1600 on 12 May. It included, how the squadron would be split into waves to attack the targets, reserves, likely defences and exit routes; Gibson provided detailed comments. Despite Gibson&#x27;s confidence, there still had not been a successful release of a live Upkeep, which took until 11 May. Most of the crews were able to practise at Reculver on the Kent coast from 11 to 14 May. Gibson practised at Reculver in Lancaster ED932/AJ-G, the aircraft he used on the raid. The aircraft&#x27;s call letters were the same as his father&#x27;s initials: AJG. On 14 May the squadron flew on a full dress rehearsal designed to simulate the routes, targets and the geography of the raid. Gibson took Whitworth with him and described the outcome in his log book as &quot;completely successful&quot;.

Cochrane travelled to Scampton on 15 May to inform Whitworth and Gibson that the operation would take place the following evening, over 16/17 May. At about 16:00, Gibson travelled with Cochrane on his return to Grantham. Here he discussed the draft operation order with Satterly and Wing Commander Dunn, No. 5 Group&#x27;s chief signals officer. He returned to Scampton and at 18:00 at Whitworth&#x27;s house, along with Wallis, he briefed Young and Maudsley, his flight commanders, and Hopgood, the deputy leader, and Hay, the squadron&#x27;s bombing leader. He had obtained Cochrane&#x27;s verbal agreement for Hopgood and Hay to attend, which proved beneficial as Hopgood was able to point out the new defences at Huls. After the meeting broke up, Whitworth informed Gibson that his dog, named Nigger, had been killed in a road accident. It did not seem to affect Gibson outwardly. He was aware how superstitious some aircrew could be, as the dog was the squadron&#x27;s mascot. Wallis feared it was a dreadful omen.

==Raid of 16/17 May 1943==
===Briefings during 16 May===
The first thing Gibson did early on the morning of 16 May was to report to the Medical Officer because of pains in his feet. The MO had previously diagnosed gout but he could not prescribe painkillers as these might affect Gibson&#x27;s alertness when flying. As Gibson felt he had no choice but to fly, he decided to continue as he was. The first briefing was at midday when Gibson and Wallis explained the details of the raid to the pilots and navigators. The next one was at 14:30 and included the bomb aimers and gunners. At 18:00 all the aircrew were called to a final briefing in the upper briefing room, which was guarded.

Gibson explained how they were going &quot;to attack the great dams of Germany&quot;. He then introduced Wallis who explained how Upkeep would be used against the dams. Cochrane then spoke and emphasised how they would do &quot;a tremendous amount of damage&quot; but their exploits would remain secret. Gibson explained the operational details again and made it clear no crews were to return with their mine. He handed over to Wing Commander Dunn who explained the signals procedures. The meeting broke up and the crews went for their meal at 19:30.

===Flight to the Möhne Dam===

Gibson was driven out to his aircraft AJ-G by his regular driver, Eileen Strawson. Cochrane came out to Gibson&#x27;s aircraft to wish him well. A photo was taken of the crew entering the aircraft beforehand. Gibson took off at 21:39 with Hopgood and Martin. They flew out over Skegness and Cromer. The winds were stronger than forecast, as a result they made landfall later and further south than expected. Gibson had the route adjusted to Roosendaal and they flew on unopposed to the Rhine. Again they were too far south, about from the expected landmark and received flak from barges on the river and batteries on the banks. They had similar navigation problems until they reached the target. They found the defences at the Möhne Dam as described at the briefing. There was an active light flak battery but no searchlights or barrage balloons.

===Attack on the Möhne Dam===
Gibson made a dummy run over the dam to look the target over and reported how he &quot;liked the look of it&quot;. The second formation of three led by Young arrived at this point. Gibson made his bombing run but the bomb was released short and did not damage the dam. It took about five minutes for the water to settle down after the explosion. He then called in Hopgood to make his attack. He watched as Hopgood&#x27;s aircraft was hit by flak, caught fire and then exploded. Hopgood&#x27;s crew had managed to release their bomb but it overshot and destroyed an electrical station below the dam. Gibson waited again for the water to settle. He then called in Martin to make his attack but this time decided to fly with him, parallel and slightly ahead, to draw off the flak. Martin&#x27;s mine did not damage the dam. Gibson called in Young and Martin flew alongside him, whilst Gibson flew along another evasive path. It was not obvious until Maltby started the next bombing run that Young&#x27;s mine had breached the dam. At 00:56, Hutchinson sent the code word &quot;N I G G E R&quot; (sic), the name of Gibson&#x27;s recently killed dog, to signal the breach to HQ 5 Group and then confirmed it on their request. Martin and Maltby departed for home.

===Attack on the Eder Dam===
After breaching the Möhne dam, Gibson flew with Young as his deputy and the remaining aircraft that still had their mines, to the Eder See. Shannon had arrived with Young while Maudslay and Knight had arrived while Hopgood had been preparing for his bombing run. The flight to the Eder See lasted about 14 minutes. They did not fly in formation and did not encounter any opposition. The dam was difficult to find and there was early morning mist starting to gather over the water. Shannon arrived too far west and found the Rehbuch dam. Gibson&#x27;s aircraft fired red Very lights to help him find the others. Although the dam&#x27;s defences consisted of only two sentries with rifles, it was still a difficult target owing to the approach. Shannon flew three dummy runs and then Maudsley flew two. Shannon flew two more dummy runs before finally releasing his bomb, which did not breach the dam. When Maudslay released his bomb it hit a parapet and his plane appeared to get caught in the explosion. However, there were messages from the aircraft and it is possible that it survived this and crash-landed later. Gibson called in Astell but did not seem to realise he was not present. He then called in Knight, who made a single dummy run before releasing his bomb. It breached the dam. At 01:54, Hutchinson signalled the breach and then confirmed it.

===Return flight, debriefing and questionnaire===
Gibson returned via the Möhne dam and the third exit route. At 02:10, he received an enquiry from HQ 5 Group, asking whether any crews were available to attack the Sorpe. He replied that there were not. He had an uneventful flight home and landed at 04:15 with just three small holes in his aircraft&#x27;s tail. He attended a debriefing and like all the pilots who returned from this raid, he had to complete a special questionnaire about the target and behaviour of the weapon. The pilots were invited to make additional comments. Gibson&#x27;s comments included how VHF had proved a &quot;perfect&quot; method to control the raid.

==Aftermath==
One of Gibson&#x27;s first tasks after his own debriefing was to deal with the early returns. He accepted that Munro&#x27;s aircraft had sustained significant damage and Rice&#x27;s mine had fallen off. Gibson was furious with Anderson because he returned with his bomb, despite the instructions at the briefing. The crew were posted off the squadron with immediate effect, although the squadron&#x27;s official records show they left in early June. At 08:30 he received a lengthy message from Cochrane thanking him for his efforts in making the raid a success.
On 27 May the King and Queen visited Scampton. There was lunch in the officers&#x27; mess followed by an inspection of the squadron. Gibson showed the King models and photos of the dams. The King chose the motto for the new squadron &#x27;Apres Moi Le Deluge&#x27;. On 28 May Archibald Sinclair, the Secretary of State for Air visited Scampton. Gibson then went on a fortnight&#x27;s leave to Cornwall where he spent most of his time fishing.

As the full extent of the losses – eight aircraft and 56 crew – became apparent, Wallis became distraught at the human cost. Humphreys and Hevron started the task of informing the next of kin. A party was organised at RAF Woodhall Spa on the evening of 17 May and Gibson attended but he made sure a beer was sent to Humphreys with his compliments. It took three days to complete the telegrams and follow-up letters. Gibson continued his usual practice of adding personal comments to letters where possible.

On 18 May, there was a parade where Cochrane and Gibson made speeches to the squadron members. He then released the air crews from duty on seven days&#x27; leave and half the ground crew on three days&#x27; leave. Gibson went on weekend leave to Penarth. On the Sunday he received a call from Harris to inform him he had been awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). His response was subdued as he felt responsible for those he had recruited and who had not returned, particularly Hopgood. He was reported as saying: &quot;It all seems so unfair&quot;.
On 22 June, Gibson and all the other newly decorated members of 617 Squadron attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace. It was performed by the Queen as the King was in North Africa. She presented Gibson with his VC and the Bar to his DSO first, and in making him the most highly decorated serviceman in the country. After the investitures all the crews went on to the Hungaria Restaurant to a dinner arranged by AV Roe, the builders of the Lancaster. Gibson was presented with a silver model of a Lancaster by the company&#x27;s chairman, Thomas Sopwith. Also at the dinner were Roy Chadwick, the designer of the Lancaster, and Wallis.

Harris made arrangements to ensure Gibson was rested from operations and on 24 July he and his wife were invited to lunch at Chequers as guests of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Here Gibson was shown a film smuggled out of Germany about the concentration camps. On 2 August, Gibson made his last flight with 617 Squadron. He flew with his regular crew and his successor, Wing Commander George Holden, to Eyebrook Reservoir to familiarise him with the technique to release Upkeep.

==Post-Chastise activities==

===Tour of Canada and US===
On 3 August Gibson travelled to London to join the party accompanying the Prime Minister to the Quadrant Conference in Quebec City, Canada. Around midnight they were taken by a special train to Faslane where they boarded the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, setting sail around 17:30 on 4 August.

The party included some of the most senior military figures such as Lord Louis Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, Chief of the Air Staff. Gibson was therefore an outsider, like fellow passenger, Brigadier Orde Wingate, the Chindits leader. However, unlike Wingate, he seems to have found it easier to enter into shipboard life. Mary Churchill, who was travelling as her father&#x27;s aide-de-camp, found Gibson &quot;had all the aura of a hero&quot; and also &quot;very agreeable and debonair to talk to&quot;. On the last evening of the voyage, on 8 August, after dinner, Gibson was invited to address the whole party on the Dams Raid.

On 9 August they arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and were transferred by special trains to Quebec. A certain amount of disinformation circulated around their arrival including how Gibson had acted as the pilot on the aircraft that had flown Churchill across the Atlantic. They arrived at a time of significant tension between the British and Canadian governments. The Canadians were unhappy with the relative lack of credit being granted to the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s (RCAF) contribution to the war effort. On 11 August, Gibson attended a select luncheon with the Prime Minister, where he was introduced to the Canadian Prime Minister, Mackenzie King. He spent the rest of the afternoon at an RCAF recruiting centre.

On 12 August Gibson attended a press conference arranged in his honour. It was hosted by C.G. Power, the Canadian Minister of National Defence for Air and attended by hundreds of journalists from around the world. Gibson responded to questions about the Dams Raid and revealed the Prime Minister called him &quot;Dam-buster&quot;. Reports of the conference were enthusiastic. He attended engagements in the Quebec area. On 17 August, President Franklin D. Roosevelt arrived at the Conference. Churchill arranged for Gibson to meet the President at a private meeting.

Gibson left Quebec on 20 August to start the Canadian leg of his tour. It was a punishing schedule and included civic receptions and speeches, motorcades, interviews, broadcasts, along with travel. He went to Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and London (Ontario). As Churchill was in New York, on 5 September, Gibson was diverted there to make a radio broadcast which was heard on station WJZ New York. In Winnipeg he met the family of Harvey Glinz, who had been killed on the Dams Raid when flying as the front-gunner in Barlow&#x27;s crew. He then went on to training bases at Carberry, Rivers, Dafoe, Moose Jaw and Moss Bank.

On 11 September he arrived in Calgary. Here he met the mother of the navigator in his own Dams Raid crew, Mrs Taerum. He spent time with her at home the following day. He also met Leading Aircraftman Robert Young, the younger brother of Squadron Leader Young, also killed on the Dams raid. He continued on to Vancouver and Victoria before returning to Montreal and Ottawa in the east. He had a week&#x27;s rest at the Seignory Club in Ottawa from 28 September to 3 October.

On 4 October he began the United States leg of his tour in Washington, D.C. He attended a major press conference at the offices of the British Information Service in New York on 7 October. This was &quot;at a time when the first American airmen were coming home &#x27;tour expired&#x27; after 25 operations. During questions one young lady asked, &#x27;Wing Commander Gibson, how many operations have you been on over Germany?&#x27; He replied, &#x27;One hundred and seventy-four.&#x27; There was a stunned silence&quot;.

On 19 October, Gibson was invested with the Commander&#x27;s Insignia to the Legion of Merit by General Henry H. Arnold at Bolling Field near Washington D.C. The decision to award him with the Legion of Merit was taken quickly. It was also exceptional. To avoid duplication American awards were, in general, not accepted for actions which had already earned a British medal. This allowed them to be restricted to cases where Americans wished to express particular gratitude. For example, they were often given for the air/sea rescue of American personnel. The award was announced formally in Britain in December 1943.

Gibson continued on to Chicago, Minneapolis and then to Los Angeles, where he stayed with the film director Howard Hawks. Most his time was spent in private, his reward for his gruelling tour. However, it is possible he might have been giving technical advice on a proposed film of the Dams Raid. Hawks had commissioned Roald Dahl to write a script for the film and had started to build models of the dams and Lancaster bombers. He was encouraged by Bomber Command&#x27;s PR Department. However, when Wallis was shown the script, he thought it absurd, and the project was scrapped.

Gibson returned to Montreal and flew back to Britain in a B-24 Liberator being ferried across the Atlantic. He landed at Prestwick on 1 December and was met by a representative from the Ministry of Intelligence. On his return he was exhausted, but still went straight from home in London to Scampton to visit 617 Squadron. When he arrived he was informed that they had moved to Coningsby, and was driven over. He visited HQ 5 Group in an attempt to obtain an operational posting, but was declared non-operational sick and sent on a month&#x27;s rest leave. At the end of his leave he was due to be posted to the Directorate of Accidents with the order to write a book. During this time he was hospitalised with Vincent&#x27;s Angina on 17 December.

The view emerged that as a result of the tour he had acquired and retained an increased sense of his own importance. In July 1944 Harris wrote to Cochrane to comment that the Americans had &quot;spoiled young Gibson&quot;. Therefore, this route was not pursued again later in the war with other highly decorated airmen, such as Leonard Cheshire.

===Directorate for the Prevention of Accidents: writing &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot;===
In January 1944, Gibson was posted to the Directorate for the Prevention of Accidents, where he appears to have been under orders to write a book. This posting was effectively a cover to give him the time and access to the resources he needed to complete it. It is possible either the Ministry of Intelligence or the RAF&#x27;s publicity department wanted him to complete a book in order to counter the increasing criticisms of the Strategic Air Offensive.

Gibson was seated in a small back room and had access to a dictaphone and typist. He did not seem to take well to his assignment initially; when Heveron travelled from Scampton to deliver some information about 617 Squadron, he found Gibson depressed and with long hair.

Gibson did seem to become increasingly enthusiastic about writing, and his wife remembered his writing at home during weekends while he was at Staff College during March–May 1944. The typescript survives of a draft Gibson submitted in summer 1944, which his wife later donated to the RAF Museum at Hendon. The writing has Gibson&#x27;s characteristic style of comments and humour, implying that the book was not ghost-written, as some have suggested. The typescript includes corrections in his own hand, which may suggest he had the help of a professional editor while he was writing. The text was passed by the censors, who edited out some of his more intolerant political and social views as well as operational information. He completed his final draft in September 1944.

===Appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;===
On 19 February 1944, Gibson appeared as the castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; with Roy Plomley.

His musical choices were:

*&quot;Warsaw Concerto&quot; by Richard Addinsell played by London Symphony Orchestra
*&quot;Where or When&quot; (from &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;) played by Jack Hylton &amp; His Orchestra
*&quot;A Thousand and One Nights Waltz&quot; by Johann Strauss II: Symphony Orchestra, conductor: Johann Strauss III
*&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; overture by Richard Wagner played by Berlin State Opera Orchestra
*&quot;If I Had My Way&quot; performed by Bing Crosby
*&quot;The Marines Hymn&quot; performed by Fred Waring &amp; His Pennsylvanians
*&quot;Royal Air Force March Past&quot; performed by The Central Band of The Royal Air Force
*&quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; (from &quot;Die Walküre&quot;) by Richard Wagner performed by Queens Hall Orchestra

===Politics, prospective parliamentary candidate for Macclesfield===
Garfield Weston, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Macclesfield, was due to retire and was looking for a replacement. In February 1944 he approached Gibson to suggest he consider standing for Parliament. Gibson agreed, but first he had to be selected by the local party. Gibson made visits to Macclesfield to campaign for selection. On one occasion he shared a platform with Lord Vansittart, who gave his name – Vansittartism – to a form of collective German guilt for the war. A short-list of candidates was drawn up, which also included Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett. Gibson was selected by a narrow margin and became the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for the constituency. Despite the constituency party&#x27;s having taken him on knowing his circumstances as a serving officer, Gibson resigned as their candidate in August 1944 citing the demands of his service career.

==Return to operations==

===Staff College and Base Staff Officer===
Gibson attended a staff course at the RAF Staff College at Bulstrode Park near Gerrards Cross from the end of March to May 1944. He then went on leave. During the last week, he became very restless as he learned about the D-Day landings. He feared the war would end before he could get back into the action. On his return, he appealed straight to Harris. Four days later, he was appointed as a staff officer at No. 55 Base, RAF East Kirkby to understudy to the Base Air Staff Officer (BASO). Duties included operational planning and liaison between the units within the Base.

On 5 July, he flew in a Lancaster for the first time since leaving No. 617 Squadron. It was a test flight and the crew commented that he handled it well considering how long it had been since he had last flown. On 19 July he joined a Lancaster crew, possibly from No. 630 Squadron, located at East Kirkby, during an attack on a V-1 flying bomb launch site at Criel-sur-Mer in France. He pasted an aiming point photo from the operation in his log book.

On 2 August, he was posted to No. 54 Base, RAF Coningsby, where he arrived on the 4th. Coningsby was a centre for tactical innovation and home of the elite No. 54 Base Flight. Here he was exposed to intelligence that increased his concern that the war would end without him getting back into the action. At this stage, he may have had Cochrane&#x27;s consent for limited operational flying, provided it was non-participatory, short time over target and he could bail out over Allied-controlled territory.

On 15 August, he flew in a Lightning as an observer on a daylight raid over Deelen in the Netherlands. He made a similar flight in a Lightning a few days later to Le Havre. On 2 September, he flew a Mosquito to Scasta in Shetland.

===Death===
On 19 September, an order came through from Bomber Command for No. 5 Group to prepare for an attack on Bremen. Planes from No. 5 Group would be responsible for all aspects of the operation, including target illumination and marking and control of the raid. Cochrane, the AOC, would be responsible for tactics and route planning. As the day progressed, the weather forecast changed, and at 16:45 an order came through to change to the reserve targets at Rheydt and Moenchen-Gladbach.

At the flight planning conference it was decided that three areas would be attacked simultaneously; they were designated as red, green and yellow. The red area was Rheydt town centre, where the attack would be fully controlled by a master bomber who would monitor the marking and coordinate the main force bombing. The tactics – dispersed marking – were untried and unrehearsed, and therefore would require expertise from the controller and markers. The announcement that Gibson would be the controller was met with general incredulity. It was assumed it would be regular controller from No. 54 Base Flight or a qualified one from No. 627 Squadron. Some suspicion started to circulate that the proposed complexity may have come from Gibson and his lack of experience in marking techniques.

As Gibson did not have a regular navigator, one had to be found to fly with him. The first choice (Charles Clark DFC) was ill, so Squadron Leader Jim Warwick was selected. He was the Station Navigation Officer and therefore screened from operations. There was also no serviceable Mosquito available at Coningsby for Gibson to use, so it was decided to use the reserve aircraft of No. 627 Squadron, located at RAF Woodhall Spa. Gibson and Warwick were driven over. When they arrived about 18:30, for unknown reasons, Gibson rejected the reserve aircraft &quot;KB213&quot; and insisted on using the Mosquito B.XX &quot;KB267&quot; instead. The crew who were expecting to fly in &quot;KB267&quot; were unhappy with the change. As the two crews were performing different functions, the bomb loads had to be swapped. They took off at 19:51.

When they arrived at the target, the marking of the red area went badly wrong owing to a series of mishaps. The three markers could not identify the marking point and one aircraft had engine problems. Gibson attempted to mark it himself but his Target Indicators (TIs) did not release. As the illumination from the flares was fading, he called for more flares and warned the red section of the main force not to bomb. He then commanded them to stand by, so they started to turn away from the target. This was potentially dangerous and exposed them to further risk from flak and night fighters. Some started to bomb the green area, either out of confusion or nervousness. He then authorised the remaining aircraft to bomb the green area. The red area was eventually marked, but it was too late to direct any of the main force&#x27;s aircraft to attack it. The raid concluded at 21:58. The time of Gibson&#x27;s departure from the target is unknown. It is possible that he loitered in a wide, high orbit to assess the outcome and left around 22:00. One crew from No. 61 Squadron claimed they heard him say he had a damaged engine.

Gibson&#x27;s aircraft crashed at Steenbergen in the Netherlands at around 22:30 and lit up in flames. Witnesses heard an aircraft flying low, saw that its cockpit was illuminated and then it crashed. At first, Gibson&#x27;s failure to return to Woodhall Spa was not considered out of the ordinary, as it was assumed he had landed at Coningsby. Likewise at Coningsby there was no immediate concern as there was fog and it was assumed he would have landed elsewhere. However, it soon became apparent he had not returned. The rumour spread rapidly around No. 5 Group that he was missing. He was not posted officially as missing until 29 November, although Prime Minister Winston Churchill was informed on 26 September: &quot;The Air Ministry have told us that Wing Commander Gibson, V.C. is reported missing from a recent raid in which he flew a Mosquito to Munchen Gladbach&quot;.

===Funeral===
At Steenbergen, the Germans cordoned off the crash site at the Graaf Hendrikpolder. Human remains were recovered which confirmed there had been one person in the plane and therefore initially it was suspected the other member may have bailed out. However, with the discovery of a third hand, the presence of a second person was confirmed. Jim Warwick was identified from his identity tag. The laundry tag in a sock identified the other person as a &quot;Guy Gibson&quot;. The remains were placed in a small specially constructed coffin.

The local deputy mayor, Mr. Herbers, wanted to give the men a proper funeral. They hired a horse-drawn hearse from nearby Halsteren. The coffin was draped with the flag of the Netherlands and was laid to rest in the Catholic cemetery. The funeral was attended by the Catholic priest, Father Verhoeven and the Protestant Pastor van den Brink. As they did not know the men&#x27;s religion they performed the funeral between them. Father Verhoeven read the psalm, &quot;De Profundis&quot; and Pastor van den Brink spoke the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in English. A cross was erected over the grave with Warwick&#x27;s full rank and name with the name &quot;Guy Gibson&quot; underneath. When it was later confirmed who &quot;Guy Gibson&quot; was, a new cross was constructed with Gibson&#x27;s rank, name and decorations.

===Analysis and theories of the crash===
The exact cause of Gibson&#x27;s crash is unknown. There are number of theories, some more likely than others. Various factors may have contributed to the loss of his Mosquito. One theory advanced is that the accident was due to Gibson&#x27;s lack of experience flying Mosquitoes. His log book, which he had last updated on 16 September, detailed 9 hours and 35 minutes flying Mosquitoes. It was observed it took him three attempts to land at Scatsta. He had been on one training flight on 31 August to learn how to dive bomb, and Mosquito crews knew they had to practise regularly, particularly in pulling out of dives. Also, he had not rehearsed the emergency procedures to exit a Mosquito, which could take 30 seconds, even on the ground.

The same lack of experience flying the Mosquito applied to his navigator, Squadron Leader Warwick, who had never flown in one operationally. That a letter was found with Warwick&#x27;s address (RAF Coningsby) on it suggests Warwick&#x27;s inclusion on the flight was a very late decision. He was experienced and would have known not to take anything like an addressed letter with him under normal circumstances.

Harris wrote that Gibson appointed himself as the controller. It is possible he seized this opportunity in Air Commodore Sharpe&#x27;s absence when the late change in target was announced. There were some instances of Mosquitoes breaking up because of their wooden frames. Harris considered this as a possibility, however, it is unlikely. Lack of fuel is the explanation most favoured by members of No. 627 Squadron at the time. In December 1985 the site was excavated and wreckage from the plane recovered. No enemy damage was noticeable. It has therefore been suggested that Gibson and Warwick had failed to switch fuel tanks at the correct time. It has also been suggested there was a fault with the fuel tank selector. Further, it is possible that a lack of familiarity with the Mosquito resulted in neither Gibson nor Warwick being able to find the switches to swap the fuel supply. This would also be a reason to explain why the cockpit was illuminated: they were attempting to locate the switches. In either case, the result would be that the aircraft simply ran out of fuel.

If Gibson left Rheydt at 22:00 then it is estimated he was about 70 miles short of the expected location if the aircraft had been operating normally. Therefore, it is possible the aircraft was flying underpowered at the time of the crash, perhaps from some sort of damage.

Speculation persists that Gibson&#x27;s Mosquito may have been shot down by German night-fighter ace Kurt Welter. On the night of the raid, 19 September 1944, Welter was the only German pilot to have claimed a Mosquito shot down that night, and Gibson&#x27;s Mosquito the only one lost. However, a listing of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; claims transcribed from the original microfilms shows that Welter&#x27;s claim was on the night of 18/19 September, and was north of Wittenberg, in the area southwest of Berlin, more than 500 km (310 miles) from Steenbergen. Welter claimed his Mosquito at 23:05 hours near Gütersloh, and recent research indicates that it was actually an intruder Mosquito FB.VI PZ177 of No. 23 Squadron. The crew, Flying Officer K. Eastwood and navigator Flight Lieutenant G.G. Rogers, were both killed.

Gibson was possibly not where others might have expected him to be. During the briefing for the raid, he was advised to use an exit route that would put him over France. However, he disagreed and insisted he would return by the shortest route at low level.

===Posthumous tributes===
Gibson&#x27;s death was formally announced on 8 January 1945. However, many knew of his loss before this date.

On 19 December 1944, Churchill wrote to Eve Gibson:

In his introduction to &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot;, Sir Arthur Harris described Gibson as:

Barnes Wallis said of Gibson:

==Personal life==
Gibson met Eve Moore, a show dancer and actress, in December 1939 when she was performing in the revue &quot;Come Out To Play&quot; at the New Hippodrome Theatre, Coventry. He later claimed that they met at a party. She claimed he saw the revue three nights in succession before introducing himself to her on the fourth and accompanying her to a cast party.

She was born Evelyn Mary Moore in Penarth, Wales, on 27 December 1911, which made her seven years older than Gibson. He became infatuated with her and travelled to meet her during his leave whenever he could as the revue progressed around the country. He also found opportunities to pursue her while on duty. He volunteered to fly Hampdens to RAF St Athan, only twelve miles from Cardiff and conveniently close to Penarth. He managed to arrange a stopover in Glasgow when travelling to Lossiemouth.

Gibson proposed to Eve in October 1940 and she accepted. On 21 November, he flew down to Cardiff in a Blenheim. They were married in Penarth&#x27;s Anglican Church on 23 November. Gibson&#x27;s Aunt Gwennie and Uncle John attended, but reports that Gibson&#x27;s father attended his wedding with his new wife are regarded as untrue.

Eve returned with him to Lincolnshire. They lodged in a bed-sit room in the Lion and Royal pub in Navenby. She was on her own most of the time and quickly became very unhappy. When No. 29 Squadron moved to West Malling, they moved into a cottage, Clare Cottage. She joined in the station&#x27;s social life taking part in revues and musicals. She could also travel more easily to London from Kent. When Gibson was posted to Cranfield, she decided to return to Penarth. In summer 1942 she found a job in London and moved there, where she shared a flat with a girlfriend. They both had casual relationships outside their marriage. They last met in August 1944 around Gibson&#x27;s birthday, and he seems to have been ready to discuss a divorce, although she seemed to want to try again when the war had finished. After Gibson&#x27;s death, Eve married in 1950 a South African businessman, Jack Hyman.

In the early 1990s, during research for his book, Richard Morris interviewed Margaret Masters, who formed a close relationship with Gibson during late 1942–44. As Margaret North, she was a member of the medical team called out on 8 December 1942 from RAF Rauceby to RAF Syerston to attend to Group Captain Walker. She was a WAAF corporal and a theatre nurse in the Crash and Burn Unit. When Gibson returned to Rauceby the following day to visit Walker, she and Gibson started talking and he asked her out. They would visit pubs and go to the cinema. As she was part of the RAF, she understood his world and she became his confidante. She helped him with an incident of operational stress in mid-January 1943. As he was married and therefore unavailable, in February 1943 she decided to marry someone else. They kept in contact and Gibson became her son&#x27;s godfather. She moved to live with her mother in Bognor Regis and they met there for the last time in summer 1944.

==Postwar legacy==

===Steenbergen===

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) maintains Gibson&#x27;s and Warwick&#x27;s graves, which are still in Steenbergen&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery. After the war, the CWGC suggested the graves be moved back to the United Kingdom or to their cemetery in nearby Bergen op Zoom. However, both Eve and Gibson&#x27;s father preferred that they be left where they fell.

The town of Steenbergen has since honoured Gibson and Warwick by naming a street after each of them (&quot;Gibsonstraat&quot; and &quot;Warwickstraat&quot;); as well as after the Lancaster and the Mosquito. The &quot;Gibsonstraat&quot; and &quot;Warwickstraat&quot; are in the vicinity of the fatal crash; the exact location is marked by brick mosaics of the British flag and the year &quot;1944&quot; at &quot;5, Mosquitostraat&quot;, between the ends of &quot;Gibsonstraat&quot; and &quot;Warwickstraat&quot;.

Also in Steenbergen is the Dambusters Memorial Park. In the park is a memorial to Gibson and Warwick. It is a granite stone topped by the twisted propeller of a Lancaster. It was unveiled by Group Captain Leonard Cheshire on 7 May 1990.

Also there has been a local council initiative that has achieved a citywalk named after Guy Gibson, named &quot;the Gibson walking route&quot;, available free of charge, at any local tourist office. The route goes past all relevant places connected to Warwick and Gibsons last flight, their crashsite and honoured graves. Also there has been a small exhibition at the local Hotel Aarden, next to the town entrance and harbour. This is maintained by a local living Englishman and with kind help from (modern) ex-No. 617 Squadron crew members. The RAF have an annual visit planned to visit and honour the Fallen in Steenbergen. No. 617 Squadron was disbanded in 2014, but was later reformed to be the first RAF squadron with the newest fighter aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, in 2018.

===Porthleven===
As Gibson had family connections, the Cornish fishing village of Porthleven has named a street after Gibson, Gibson Way. There is a memorial in the village cemetery bearing his name. His name also appears on the village War Memorial overlooking the harbour.

A plaque commemorating Gibson has been mounted in the harbour-facing wall of the institute at Porthleven, located at the southern end of Institute Hill. It reads:
===Publication of &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot;===
Gibson&#x27;s book, &quot;Enemy Coast Ahead&quot;, was first serialized in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; during December 1944. The book was published in February 1946 by Michael Joseph and was very well received. It has remained in print most of the time since 1946. A new edition of the work was issued by Greenhill Books in 2019, with additional material by Robert Owen, Official Historian of the No. 617 Squadron Association, and historian and broadcaster James Holland. 

===Film portrayal===
A 1955 film, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, was made of the exploits of No. 617 Squadron; Gibson was played by Richard Todd in the film.
===Vickers VC10===
An RAF Vickers VC10 airliner, serial number &quot;XV102&quot;, was named &quot;Guy Gibson&quot; in 1968, soon after it came into service. The aircraft&#x27;s duties included carrying Margaret Thatcher while she was prime minister, as well as members of the Royal Family. It flew with the RAF until it was withdrawn from service in 2011; it was scrapped in 2012.

===Fiction===
Gibson appears as a fictionalized character in Stephen Baxter&#x27;s &quot;The Time Ships&quot;, the authorised sequel to &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. Barnes Wallis also has a role in this story.

===Commemorative plaque===
To commemorate Gibson&#x27;s residency there is a blue plaque at 32 Aberdeen Place, St John&#x27;s Wood, north London.

A plaque also marks the house of Eve&#x27;s parents, where he and Eve occasionally lived between their marriage and 1943, at 1 Archer Road, Penarth.

==Honours, awards and citations==

Gibson&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals are on display at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon, England.

Initially Eve Gibson presented them to the Imperial War Museum. However, in 1956 she presented them to Gibson&#x27;s father. He wore them to the Remembrance Day parade in 1956. He then passed them on to St Edward&#x27;s School and they were placed in the school&#x27;s memorial library until his death in 1968.

<text>MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) is an archaeology and built heritage practice and independent charitable company registered with the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA). It provides a wide range of professional archaeological services to clients in London and across the UK. As one of the largest archaeological service providers in the UK, MOLA is unique in holding IRO (Independent Research Organisation) status.

MOLA’s operations were historically focused within Greater London but have expanded nationwide. The organization employs over 300 staff across 4 locations: the central London headquarters, and further offices in Northampton, Basingstoke, and Birmingham.

Since registering as a charity in 2011, MOLA has pursued its own academic research strategy and developed extensive community engagement and education programmes. These include the Thames Discovery Programme, CITiZAN and the Time Truck.

Commercial services offered include expertise and advice at all stages of development from pre-planning onwards: management and consultancy advice, impact assessments, excavation, mitigation (urban, rural, infrastructure, and other schemes), standing building recording, surveying and geomatics, geoarchaeology, finds and environmental services, post-excavation and publication, graphics and photography, editing, and archiving.

Since 2017 MOLA has been part of a consortium with Headland Archaeology – MOLA Headland Infrastructure – to enable the delivery of archaeological and heritage services to large-scale infrastructure projects.

== Background ==
MOLA originated from a set of departments within the Museum of London but it is now entirely separate.

The Department of Urban Archaeology (DUA) was formed in 1973 as part of the Rescue archaeology movement, a response to the threat posed to unrecorded archaeological remains by increasing deep-basement office redevelopment in the City of London. Prior to this, recording remains prior to destruction was carried out by individuals and volunteers, including Andrew Westman. Public reaction to the publication of &quot;The Future of London&#x27;s Past&quot;  by archaeologist Martin Biddle helped to secure government funding for a small number of staff to found the DUA. The team was led by Brian Hobley and revolutionised the detailed understanding of London&#x27;s archaeology and early history.

The Department of Greater London Archaeology (DGLA) was formed from several local archaeological societies in the 1980s and led by Harvey Sheldon to address similar concerns in other historical areas of the capital, particularly in Southwark and Inner North London.

The 1980s saw rapid development in the City of London, and an associated increase in archaeological work. The DUA and DGLA encouraged site developers to fund excavations prior to construction. As a result, both organisations grew rapidly, with each employing over 100 staff by the late 1980s.

Changes in the legislation surrounding archaeological work were taking place at the same time. Up until 1990, archaeological units throughout England provided both curatorial advice and contractual services. This dual role was increasingly seen as carrying a potential conflict of interest, and after the controversial redevelopment of Shakespeare&#x27;s Rose Theatre site in Southwark changes were made to the planning guidance (PPG 16).

Responsibility for curatorial advice was transferred to local authorities in the cases of the City of London and Southwark, and to Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service (GLAAS) in the case of the other Greater London boroughs. Meanwhile, the DUA and DGLA merged in 1991 to form MoLAS (Museum of London Archaeology Service) to provide services as an archaeological contractor.

In 2011, MOLA separated entirely from the Museum of London, becoming an independent charitable company. It became one of only a handful of non-academic institutions to hold IRO (Independent Research Organisation) status in 2014. 
MOLA&#x27;s operations continue to expand nationwide, with subsidiary offices established in Birmingham in 2011, Northampton in 2014 (with the acquisition of Northamptonshire Archaeology to form a new company: MOLA Northampton), and Basingstoke in 2017.

In 2015 MOLA became the host for the Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network, known by its abbreviation &quot;CITiZAN&quot;, a community archaeology project, led by Gustav Milne, working in areas of England&#x27;s coastline documenting coastal and intertidal history before it is washed away by tidal forces.

In 2022 MOLA acquired L - P : Archaeology, incorporating former L – P offices in Stansted, Chester, and Bristol. In 2023 one of the founding partners of L - P : Archaeology Guy Hunt was appointed as the Chief Executive of MOLA.

Some of the larger and more important excavations have included the Roman amphitheatre at Guildhall Yard, a complex Roman and medieval sequence at No 1 Poultry near Bank Station, excavations within the Middle Saxon settlement at Covent Garden during the expansion of the Royal Opera House, excavations along the route of the Jubilee Line Extension in Southwark and Westminster, and the recovery of over 15,000 human skeletons during excavation of the Priory and Hospital of St Mary Spital in Spitalfields. Other notable work has been an English Heritage-funded programme of publication. General popular booklets and academic monographs are published in-house and have attracted consistently good reviews and several awards for private clients and developers. Major non-London projects have included the discovery of a Saxon princely burial at Prittlewell in Southend-on-Sea.

=== Roman London ===

Excavations by the DUA and DGLA in the 1970s and 1980s revealed that the history of the Roman founding and development of Londinium was much more complex than previously realised. London was established on a militarily-strategic and economically important location which is now the site of the City of London and North Southwark. The settlement was formed shortly after AD 43 AD, probably around the year 47, and a permanent river-crossing was established very near to the current position of London Bridge. Londinium grew rapidly in the 50s but was destroyed in the Boudican revolt around AD 60. The town was rebuilt shortly afterwards and became the provincial capital, enjoying substantial public investment and spectacular economic growth until its height in the early 2nd century. An extensive fire, economic changes, and plague saw growth stagnate in the mid-2nd century, though defensive walls were added around AD 200 during or after the contention between Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus. Later Roman London experienced urban renewal in many areas and remained an important centre, though it was no longer a large port or centre of trade. The town suffered a final decline in the late 4th century and was rapidly abandoned, with little evidence of occupation soon after the Roman withdrawal from Britain. Work in recent years by MOLA has continued to add significant information, with recent research findings including extramural Roman settlement in Westminster at St Martin-in-the-Fields and a post-Boudican fortified enclosure at Plantation Place on Cornhill.

=== Discovery of Lundenwic ===
Excavation in the City of London in the 1970s and 1980s had failed to find virtually any evidence of occupation in the period from the 5th to the 10th century despite apparently unambiguous historical evidence of London&#x27;s existence at least from AD 604 onwards. However, the Department of Greater London Archaeology (DGLA) had discovered so-called Saxon farms in the area of Fleet Street, Covent Garden, and Westminster. In the mid 1980s, Alan Vince and Martin Biddle independently came up with the theory that London had been re-established not in the City but a couple of miles to the west, centred on the area called Aldwych. This Middle Saxon settlement was known as Lundenwic. Lundenwic was subjected to increasing Viking attack in the 9th century and the population may have been forced to scatter. Around the year 886, Alfred the Great moved the Londoners back into the City of London and the shelter of the Roman defensive walls, which still stood. The Late Saxon reoccupation of the Roman town site was known as Lundenburgh.
