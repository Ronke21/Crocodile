<text>Christopher Livingstone Eubank (born 8 August 1966) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 1998. He held the World Boxing Organization (WBO) middleweight and super-middleweight titles between 1990 and 1995, and is ranked by BoxRec as the third best British super-middleweight boxer of all time.

He reigned as world champion for over five years, was undefeated in his first 10 years as a professional, and remained undefeated at middleweight. His world title contests against fellow Britons Nigel Benn and Michael Watson helped British boxing ride a peak of popularity in the 1990s, with Eubank&#x27;s eccentric personality making him one of the most recognisable celebrities of the period.

In his final two years of boxing he challenged then-up and coming contender Joe Calzaghe in a bid to reclaim his WBO super-middleweight title, with a victorious Calzaghe later claiming that it was the toughest fight of his whole career. Eubank&#x27;s last two fights were against WBO junior-heavyweight champion Carl Thompson, both of which were brutal encounters. In the rematch, Eubank was stopped for the first and only time in his career.

Eubank is credited for his bravery in the ring, in which he was able to take considerable amounts of punishment from power punchers en route to his victories and defeats, and for this he is said to have a &quot;granite&quot; chin. He is also known for his heel-like elitist persona: Speaking a dressing like an upper-class elite, vaulting over the ring ropes as an entrance, but also the art of mental warfare, notably against Nigel Benn for their first bout. His son, Chris Eubank Jr., is also a professional boxer. 

==Early life==
Eubank, was born on 8 August 1966, in Dulwich, South London, to Rachel Scollins. From when he was two months old until the age of six, he was raised in Jamaica. On his return to England, he lived in Stoke Newington, Dalston, Hackney and then Peckham, in a largely impoverished environment.

He attended Northwold Primary School in Upper Clapton, Bellenden Junior School, and then Thomas Calton Secondary School in Peckham, from where he was suspended 18 times in one year and then expelled, despite claiming he was gallantly trying to protect other children from bullies. Some time was spent at Orchard Lodge Regional Resource Centre, Anerley, in 1981. When he was 16, his father sent him to New York in the U.S. to live with his mother in the tough South Bronx district.

==Boxing career==

Eubank made a fresh start in New York, where he trained at the Jerome Boxing Club on Westchester Avenue, following in the footsteps of his elder brothers (twins, Peter and Simon Eubank) back in England. Eubank became obsessed with boxing training and went to the gym every day, working as caretaker to pay his way. He won the 1984 Spanish Golden Gloves Tournament and also got to the semi-final stage of the main Golden Gloves tourney at Madison Square Garden at aged 18.

He writes in his autobiography that his drive to succeed in boxing came through his drive to become an accepted individual, largely caused by subjective bullying from his elder brothers.

He made his professional debut at the Atlantis Hotel and Casino against Tim Brown, shortly after his 19th birthday. Although his next 10 fights went largely unnoticed, in February 1989 he made brief headlines in defeating Jamaican Anthony Logan in an undercard match to a Nigel Benn-headliner. Benn was a rising star at the time and Logan had come close to beating him. Eubank now made Brighton in England his adopted hometown and set his sights on Benn, believing he could beat him.

After a string of stoppage victories following a dominant 10-round decision over American gatekeeper/journeyman Randy Smith, Eubank captured the WBC International title in 1990 against Hugo Corti. Later in the year, he knocked out Renaldo Dos Santos in precisely 20 seconds (including the 10-count).

===WBO middleweight champion===

Eubank won the WBO middleweight title against Nigel Benn (and the odds) in a classic encounter that was later released on DVD: a gruelling battle which ended when Benn (ahead on points, but only narrowly) was stopped on his feet near the end of round 9. Eubank would defend the title successfully against Dan Sherry (in a fight cut short by a headbutt, for which Eubank was penalised 2 points but still won on points over the 9 completed rounds), fellow Briton Gary Stretch and fellow Briton, Michael Watson, fighting him to a narrow 12-round majority decision in Eubank&#x27;s favour. This concluded Eubank&#x27;s career as a middleweight, with a 28–0 record.

===WBO super-middleweight champion===
A rematch with Watson for the vacant WBO super-middleweight title took place in September 1991, in which Watson suffered a near-fatal injury. Eubank was behind on all scorecards after 10 rounds, and was knocked down 18 seconds from the end of the round. He rose from the canvas (being given only a standing four-count instead of eight) to unleash a devastating uppercut to Watson&#x27;s jaw right at the end of the round, knocking Watson&#x27;s head and neck backwards into the ring ropes. The bell sounded to end the round as soon as Watson was up from the count. It was still obvious to all observers – and to Eubank himself – that he needed a knockout to win: and early in the 12th, with Watson still visibly shaken, the fight was stopped with Watson under a flurry of punches from Eubank. Soon after the fight Watson collapsed in his corner. His condition may have been worsened by delay in receiving medical attention: there was no ambulance or paramedic at the event and after eight minutes on the ring floor, Watson was attended by doctors wearing dinner jackets, arriving late. Following the fight, Eubank contemplated quitting the sport. Commentator Reg Gutteridge said, in the moment, he had, &quot;never seen a more dramatic end to a world title fight&quot;. Eubank later reflected on the aftermath: &quot;I lost my finishing instinct in the ring – I couldn&#x27;t finish fights any more. However, I needed to work and so I carried on and I won most of my fights on decisions. And I blamed myself, after all, it was me who threw the punch.&quot;

Eubank was particularly noted for his confidence, concentration, composure, and extravagant behaviour, and antics that included a vault over the top-rope into the ring before each fight. His trademark theme tune was Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Simply the Best&quot;. He would often engage in posturing (particularly between rounds of fights). Eubank was by now presented as something of a &quot;man you love to hate&quot; figure in the British tabloid press because of his perceived arrogance and for his singularly unconventional sense of style. In boxing circles he enjoyed even less popularity, having once referred to the sport as a &#x27;mug&#x27;s game&#x27; on national television (This was a selective quote – Eubank had actually been discussing the seedier side of the sport, such as the beatings taken by journeyman fighters for small sums of money, or boxers that were lied to and ripped off by promoters).

Now the holder of a second title, Eubank relinquished his middleweight title and concentrated on defending his new crown at the higher weight of . After the Watson tragedy Eubank never again showed any desire to knock opponents out, preferring to retain his title through points victories. He made successful defences against &quot;Sugarboy&quot; Malinga, the American quartet of John Jarvis, Ron Essett, Tony Thornton and former World Champion Lindell Holmes, as well as Juan Carlos Giminez Ferreyra and a draw with fellow Briton Ray Close.

====Eubank vs Benn II====

Nigel Benn moved up to super middleweight and became WBC champion. The pair agreed to meet in a WBC/WBO unification rematch. In 1993 the rivals would engage in another contest named &#x27;Judgement Day&#x27; and fought an exciting contest – albeit less brutal than their first – to a draw. Don King had negotiated the contracts so that he would own both the winner and the loser of Eubank v Benn 2. Barry Hearn claimed that, as a draw was not written into the contract, Eubank was free to sign a new deal with him instead of King. He did – and Benn also did not sign for King, on the same pretext.

Following the Benn fight, Eubank went on to defeat Graciano Rocchigiani of Germany, the undefeated former IBF super-middleweight title holder. After a split points victory over Ray Close, in the King&#x27;s Hall Belfast, Eubank signed an eight-fight £10-million deal with Sky Sports for contests in South Africa, Manchester, London and Millstreet. Eubank made five further successful defences, beating British world title contenders Henry Wharton and Sam Storey as well as unbeaten Dan Schommer and Mauricio Amaral Costa.

====Eubank vs Collins====
In March 1995, however, Eubank lost his title to Irishman Steve Collins, by unanimous decision.

The film &quot;One Night in Millstreet&quot; is about the 1995 fight with Collins.

Eubank won an eliminator for his old title against Jose Ignacio Barruetabena, as well as a win over Bruno Ruben Godoy. A rematch with Collins took place in Cork, Ireland, and Eubank lost again by a surprisingly narrow split decision. He announced his retirement from the ring in October 1995. He made a quick comeback in 1996, however, defeating Luis Dionisio Barrera and Camilo Alarcon.

====Calzaghe vs Eubank====
After Steve Collins withdrew from his WBO super-middleweight title defence against Joe Calzaghe and unexpectedly retired in October 1997, Calzaghe was matched against Eubank for the vacant title with 11 days&#x27; notice. Eubank had been scheduled to box at light-heavyweight on the undercard. Eubank was knocked down twice and lost on points to Calzaghe, but saw his popularity rise as a result of managing to finish the fight against his more fancied opponent.

===Cruiserweight===
Eubank then added 20 lbs in weight and challenged Britain&#x27;s Carl Thompson for the WBO cruiserweight title. Eubank floored Thompson in the fourth round but, as in the first Steve Collins fight, failed to press home his advantage. The fight went the distance, with Thompson&#x27;s strength and durability eventually telling in the later rounds. Thompson won by unanimous decision, but the closeness of the fight was reflected in the scoring, with two of the three judges giving the fight to Thompson by a single point.

A rematch was quickly arranged for three months later and they again fought for the WBO cruiserweight championship in what turned out to be Eubank&#x27;s last fight. Eubank had the better of the fight early in the rematch, but the short rest between the bouts came back to haunt him as his left eye that was damaged in the first fight rapidly began to swell. The fight was stopped at the end of the ninth round, when Eubank&#x27;s left eye closed completely from swelling. At the time he was ahead on the scorecards. It was the only stoppage loss of Eubank&#x27;s career spanning three weight divisions, 30 pounds and 13 years as professional.

Eubank finished his career with a record of 45 wins (23 KOs), five losses, and two draws.

==Career beyond boxing==
Throughout his successful years and beyond, Eubank developed a reputation for eccentricity. In a poll published by BBC &quot;Homes and Antiques&quot; magazine in January 2006, Eubank was voted the second most eccentric star (after Björk). Speaking with a lisp and in affected upper-class tones; dressing as a stereotypically upper-class Englishman (in jodhpurs, bowler hat and riding boots; sporting a monocle) and carrying a silver-tipped cane, such affectations have provoked criticism in tabloid newspapers. However, in 1991 and 1993 he won Britain&#x27;s Best Dressed Man award, given by the Menswear Association of Great Britain.

His collection of vehicles included a customised Harley-Davidson and a huge American Peterbilt 379 truck cab – the largest lorry in Europe. At one time he owned the only Hummer in Britain.

In the early 1990s, Eubank was caricatured as a puppet on &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. He featured on the front cover of &quot;Esquire&quot; for the April 1992 edition. He was mentioned in a scene of &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, in which the title character desperately tries to think of ideas for a new television show, one of which is entitled &quot;Youth Hosteling with Chris Eubank&quot;. He has featured in television advertisements (commercials) for Nescafé, Royal Mail, McDonald&#x27;s, Jaffa Cakes and Orbit, and has modelled for Vivienne Westwood and Versace.

Eubank purchased the lord of the manor rights in Brighton at auction in 1996 and used the ancient right of this position to appoint a town crier in addition to the town crier employed by the local authority. In 1994 he took over a prime site in the city, which he called &#x27;Buckingham Place&#x27;. He knocked down the interior whilst keeping the grade II façade intact and built 69 flats for the homeless, using £1,250,000 of his own money. The building was later sold for redevelopment in 2000.

In 1996, Eubank was the guest presenter on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In 1999, he launched the Dreamcast and in the same year, he appeared in his truck in the music video for the song &quot;Turn Around&quot; by Phats &amp; Small. He also had his own show on Talk Radio called &quot;Eubank&#x27;s People&quot;. Guests included Linford Christie, John Fashanu, Lennox Lewis, and Naseem Hamed.

In 2001, he appeared in the first series of the reality television show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; on Channel 4, where he was the first ever celebrity to be evicted from the house.

In 2002, Eubank was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary entitled &quot;When Louis Met...Chris Eubank&quot;, in which Theroux and his camera crew accompanied Eubank for a period. In 2003, the Eubanks invited television cameras to follow their lives for nine months; the resulting show, &quot;At Home with the Eubanks&quot;, was broadcast on Five.

During Michael Watson&#x27;s recovery from his near-fatal injury during their bout in 1991, Watson and Eubank became friends, with Eubank accompanying Watson for the final mile of the 2003 London Marathon, which Watson – still showing physical damage from the fight and taking more than six days – completed to raise money for charity.

In 2006, Eubank was sacked by his own public relations advisor, Richard Hillgrove, for being &quot;too eccentric&quot;.

In 2015, Eubank took part in the 2015 series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He lasted 17 days and finished in ninth position.

In 2019, Eubank appeared alongside his son Chris Eubank Jr., on Series 1 of &quot;Celebrity Gogglebox&quot;. They re-appeared in Series 3 in 2021.

In 2021, Eubank appeared as a guest on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;.

In April 2023 he was a contestant in the Channel 4 reality television series, &quot;Scared of the Dark&quot;.

Eubank is credited as appearing in the film One Night in Millstreet. In an interview at the time of release for the film Eubank praised cult-leader Tony Quinn.

===Bankruptcy===
In November 2009, Eubank was declared bankrupt, owing £1.3 million in taxes.

===Anti-war activism===
On 14 October 2003, Eubank was intercepted by police whilst driving around Parliament Square, Westminster, in his truck, which displayed the message &quot;Tony Blair! Military occupation causes terrorism&quot;. He completed a number of circuits before he was arrested. On 22 February 2007, Eubank was arrested outside Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall for a suspected breach of the peace after driving through central London in his truck, which was emblazoned with a message condemning Tony Blair for sending Prince Harry to Iraq. The banner read &quot;Blair – don&#x27;t send our young prince to your catastrophic illegal war, to make it look plausible!&quot; On 23 May 2007, he was charged with making an unlawful anti-war protest after parking his seven-ton truck outside Downing Street. On 16 November 2007, he failed to turn up at court, so an arrest warrant was issued, and he was fined.

===Ambassadorship===
In October 2005, Eubank was appointed as the first ambassador for gambling charity GamCare, to support and encourage responsible gambling.

===Tailored suit designer===
Known for his unique sense of style, Eubank has won the Britain&#x27;s Best Dressed Man many times. In 2010, Eubank, once a regular customer, started designing tailored suits for Cad and the Dandy, a Savile Row bespoke tailoring company.

===&quot;Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank&quot;===
On 19 August 2015, a spoof trailer was made available for &quot;Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank&quot; in association with Hostelworld, detailing Eubank&#x27;s journey around Britain in an effort to learn more about youth hostels. The joke originates from the comedy show &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, in which the title character pitches a selection of ideas for television shows.

==Personal life==
Eubank and his first wife, Karron (married 23 December 1990 in Brighton), had four children (Christopher, born on 18 September 1989; Sebastian (18 July 1991– 9 July 2021); Emily, born on 19 April 1994; and Joseph, born on 23 October 1996) and have over the years starred in various television programmes. Eubank also has an elder son, Nathanael Wilson, born August 1988. Eubank is the cousin of English media personality Mica Paris. His son Sebastian, also a professional boxer, died aged 29 on 9 July 2021 in Dubai.

In 1992, Eubank was involved in a fatal collision when he lost control of his car on the London to Brighton road; the car came off the road and killed a building site worker. He was convicted of driving without due care and attention, fined £250 plus £1,450 costs, and had six penalty points added to his driving licence.

In August 2005, Karron petitioned for divorce from Eubank. Also in 2005, Eubank was convicted of taking a vehicle without consent. He had driven a beer lorry which was being unloaded away from a place where he considered it to be causing an unreasonable obstruction. In 2014, Eubank married his manager Claire Geary, but the couple divorced in 2017.

In 2015, Eubank adopted the nickname of his deceased father, &quot;English&quot;, to privately perpetuate his memory and to publicly differentiate himself from the budding boxing career of his son Chris Jr.

In 2021, Eubank was prosecuted after he was filmed by CyclingMikey driving through a red light.

<text>Philip the Evangelist (, &quot;Philippos&quot;) appears several times in the Acts of the Apostles. He was one of the Seven chosen to care for the poor of the Christian community in Jerusalem (). He preached and performed miracles in Samaria, and met and baptised an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, traditionally marking the start of the Ethiopian Church (). Later, Philip lived in Caesarea Maritima with his four daughters who prophesied, where he was visited by Paul the Apostle ().

==New Testament==
Philip bore a Greek name. He is first mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles () as one of &quot;Seven Deacons&quot; who were chosen to attend to certain temporal affairs of the church in Jerusalem in consequence of the murmurings of the Hellenists against the Hebrews.

After the martyrdom of Stephen he went to &quot;the city of Samaria&quot;, where he preached with much success, Simon Magus being one of his converts. He afterwards was told by an angel of the Lord to go to the road between Jerusalem and Gaza. There he instructed and baptized the Ethiopian eunuch; next he was &quot;caught away&quot; by the Spirit and &quot;found at Azotus&quot; (Ashdod); and then &quot;passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea&quot; (Acts 8).

Here some years afterwards, according to , where he is described as &quot;the evangelist&quot; (a term found again in the New Testament only in Ephesians ; 2 Timothy ), he entertained Paul the Apostle and his companions on their way to Jerusalem; at that time &quot;he had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy&quot;.

==Tradition==
At a very early period he came to be confused with the Philip the Apostle; the confusion was all the more easy because, as an esteemed member of the apostolic company, he may readily have been described as an apostle in the wider sense of that word, beyond the original 12 Apostles. A late tradition describes him as settling at Tralles in Anatolia, where he became the bishop of that church.

==Feasts==
&quot;St Philip the Deacon&quot; is commemorated on October 11 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, in the Roman Rite, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, and in the Anglican communion including, for example, the U.S. Episcopal Church, and the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. Additionally, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Philip is counted among the Seventy Apostles, and is referred to as a Protodeacon; this feast day is celebrated on January 4.

<text>Stourbridge () is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in the West Midlands, England. Situated on the River Stour, the town lies around west of Birmingham,
at the southwestern edge of the Black Country conurbation. Historically in Worcestershire, it was the centre of British glass making during the Industrial Revolution. The 2011 UK census recorded the town&#x27;s population as 63,298.

==Geography==
Stourbridge is about west of Birmingham. It is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley at the southwestern edge of the Black Country and the West Midlands conurbation, Stourbridge includes the villages and suburbs of Amblecote, Lye, Norton, Oldswinford, Pedmore, Stambermill, Stourton, Wollaston, Wollescote and Wordsley.

Much of Stourbridge consists of residential streets interspersed with green spaces. Mary Stevens Park, opened in 1931, has a lake, a bandstand, a cafe, and open spaces. There are two other large parks also gifted to Stourbridge people by the Stevens family, one in Lye/Wollescote and the other in Quarry Bank.

Bordered by green belt land, Stourbridge is close to countryside with the Clent Hills to the south and southwest Staffordshire and Kinver Edge to the west.

===Closest cities, towns and villages===
==History==
Stourbridge was listed in the 1255 Worcestershire assize roll as Sturbrug or Sturesbridge. The medieval township was named for a bridge which crossed the River Stour. The settlement was originally known as Bedcote and was likely Anglo-Saxon in origin. It lay within the manor of Swynford or Suineford (now Oldswinford), which appears in William the Conqueror&#x27;s Domesday Book of 1086.

&quot;Pigot and Co.&#x27;s National Commercial Directory for 1828-9&quot; describes Stourbridge as a &quot;populous, wealthy, and flourishing market town&quot; and gives its population in 1821 as 5,090. 

In 1966, the Stourbridge border between Worcestershire and Staffordshire, which for centuries had been marked by the River Stour, was moved a couple of miles north when Amblecote was incorporated into the Borough of Stourbridge. Following the Local Government Act 1972, Stourbridge was amalgamated into the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley and became part of the wider West Midlands county in 1974.

===Glass Making in Stourbridge===
The town gives its name to local glass production, which has been manufactured since the early 1600s. The local clay proved particularly suitable for the industry, taken up predominantly after the immigration of French coal miners in the Huguenot diaspora. However, most of the glass industry was actually located in surrounding areas including Wordsley, Amblecote and Oldswinford. The rich natural resources of coal and fireclay for lining furnaces made it the perfect location for the industry. Glass making peaked in the 19th century, encouraged by the famous glass-making family, the Jeavons.

The 1861 census identified that 1,032 residents of Stourbridge were involved in the glass trade in some way. Of these, 541 were glass workers - an increase from 409 in 1851, believed to be partly caused by the collapse of the glass industry in nearby Dudley in the 1850s. The vast majority of those involved in the glass trade came from Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. 9% came from other parts of England and 0.2% had come from abroad. Of particular note are glass cutters, as 8.1% had come from Ireland, believed to be as a result of the decline of the Irish glasscutting industry in the first half of the 1800s. The houses inhabited by glassworkers were of a much better quality in comparison to the slums in which the nailmakers of Lye and Wollescote lived. However, only a few glassworkers owned their own houses.

The Red House Cone, thought to be the only complete remaining glass cone of its kind, stands on the Stourbridge Canal at Wordsley. It is the site of the Red House Glass Museum and there are regular demonstrations of traditional glass blowing.

==Present==

The town centre has seen major regeneration in recent years. In 2014, Lion Health medical centre opened in the renovated former foundry of Foster, Rastrick and Company – where the Stourbridge Lion locomotive was manufactured. The next phase of regeneration on the foundry site will create parkland next to Stourbridge Canal with a &quot;heritage and community hub&quot; named Riverside House.

Crown Centre Shopping Mall at the bottom of Stourbridge High Street opened in 2013 at the site of the old Crown Centre and Bell Street multi-storey car park, which were demolished between 2012 and 2013. Costing £50m, the new mall is home to a Tesco anchor store, a two-level underground car park, six retail stores and a central food court. Stourbridge Bus Station underwent substantial redevelopment and re-opened as Stourbridge Interchange in April 2012.

In 2010, Stourbridge was awarded Fairtrade Town status. Stourbridge Farmers&#x27; and Craft Market takes place on the first and third Saturday of every month in the Clock Square. Throughout the summer, Mary Stevens Park hosts outdoor live music.

In the 2011 Census, the average age of people in Stourbridge was 42.

Margot James, Conservative held the Stourbridge parliamentary constituency 2010–2019. She was succeeded in 2019 by Suzanne Webb of the same party. After the 2024 General Election, Cat Eccles, Labour, became MP.

==Transport==

Three main roads meet in Stourbridge, these being the A451, the A458 and the A491, the last forming the one way Stourbridge Ring Road.

Stourbridge has two railway stations, the main one being Stourbridge Junction. From here, it is around 30 minutes to Birmingham, 30 minutes to Worcester and between two and 2.5 hours to London. The other station, Stourbridge Town, is served only by a shuttle to and from Stourbridge Junction. At just over , the Stourbridge Town Branch Line is believed to be the shortest railway branch line in Europe. The former main line to Wolverhampton via Dudley, and branches to Wombourne and Walsall closed in the 1960s. However the line towards Dudley remains open for freight as far as the Round Oak Steel Terminal north of Brierley Hill. In January 2021, proposals were made to reopen the line to Brierley Hill to passengers using a light rail vehicle similar to that used on the Stourbridge Branch Line.

Stourbridge Interchange is the main bus station, located in the town centre next to Stourbridge Town railway station. The Interchange opened in 2012 at a cost of £7 million. Most services are operated by National Express West Midlands and Diamond Bus which offer links to local areas such as Wollaston and Pedmore, and further destinations like Birmingham,Wolverhampton and Kidderminster. Diamond Bus operate the tendered service 242 to Kinver which was previously operated by The Green Bus Company but more recently Select Bus Services and added additional journeys.

By bike, National Route 54 of the National Cycle Network links Stourbridge with Dudley via the canal towpaths.

<doc id="412094" wikidata="Q1503239" url="?curid=412094" title="Symmetry of second derivatives">
<text>In mathematics, the symmetry of second derivatives (also called the equality of mixed partials) is the fact that exchanging the order of partial derivatives of a multivariate function
:formula_1
does not change the result if some continuity conditions are satisfied (see below); that is, the second-order partial derivatives satisfy the identities
:formula_2
In other words, the matrix of the second-order partial derivatives, known as the Hessian matrix, is a symmetric matrix. 

Sufficient conditions for the symmetry to hold are given by Schwarz&#x27;s theorem, also called Clairaut&#x27;s theorem or Young&#x27;s theorem.

In the context of partial differential equations, it is called the Schwarz [[integrability conditions for differential systems|integrability]] condition.
== Formal expressions of symmetry ==
In symbols, the symmetry may be expressed as:

:formula_3

Another notation is:

:formula_4

In terms of composition of the differential operator which takes the partial derivative with respect to :

:formula_5.

From this relation it follows that the ring of differential operators with constant coefficients, generated by the , is commutative; but this is only true as operators over a domain of sufficiently differentiable functions. It is easy to check the symmetry as applied to monomials, so that one can take polynomials in the as a domain. In fact smooth functions are another valid domain.

== History ==
The result on the equality of mixed partial derivatives under certain conditions has a long history. The list of unsuccessful proposed proofs started with Euler&#x27;s, published in 1740, although already in 1721 Bernoulli had implicitly assumed the result with no formal justification. Clairaut also published a proposed proof in 1740, with no other attempts until the end of the 18th century. Starting then, for a period of 70 years, a number of incomplete proofs were proposed. The proof of Lagrange (1797) was improved by Cauchy (1823), but assumed the existence and continuity of the partial derivatives formula_6 and formula_7. Other attempts were made by P. Blanchet (1841), Duhamel (1856), Sturm (1857), Schlömilch (1862), and Bertrand (1864). Finally in 1867 Lindelöf systematically analyzed all the earlier flawed proofs and was able to exhibit a specific counterexample where mixed derivatives failed to be equal.

Six years after that, Schwarz succeeded in giving the first rigorous proof. Dini later contributed by finding more general conditions than those of Schwarz. Eventually a clean and more general version was found by Jordan in 1883 that is still the proof found in most textbooks. Minor variants of earlier proofs were published by Laurent (1885), Peano (1889 and 1893), J. Edwards (1892), P. Haag (1893), J. K. Whittemore (1898), Vivanti (1899) and Pierpont (1905). Further progress was made in 1907-1909 when E. W. Hobson and W. H. Young found proofs with weaker conditions than those of Schwarz and Dini. In 1918, Carathéodory gave a different proof based on the Lebesgue integral.
== Schwarz&#x27;s theorem ==

In mathematical analysis, Schwarz&#x27;s theorem (or Clairaut&#x27;s theorem on equality of mixed partials) named after Alexis Clairaut and Hermann Schwarz, states that for a function formula_8 defined on a set formula_9, if formula_10 is a point such that some neighborhood of formula_11 is contained in formula_12 and formula_13 has continuous second partial derivatives on that neighborhood of formula_11, then for all and in formula_15

:formula_16

The partial derivatives of this function commute at that point.

One easy way to establish this theorem (in the case where formula_17, formula_18, and formula_19, which readily entails the result in general) is by applying Green&#x27;s theorem to the gradient of formula_20

An elementary proof for functions on open subsets of the plane is as follows (by a simple reduction, the general case for the theorem of Schwarz easily reduces to the planar case). Let formula_21 be a differentiable function on an open rectangle formula_12 containing a point formula_23 and suppose that formula_24 is continuous with continuous formula_25 and formula_26 over formula_27 Define

:formula_28

These functions are defined for formula_29, where formula_30 and formula_31 is contained in formula_27

By the mean value theorem, for fixed and non-zero, formula_33 can be found in the open interval formula_34 with

:formula_35

Since formula_36, the first equality below can be divided by formula_37:

:formula_38

Letting formula_39 tend to zero in the last equality, the continuity assumptions on formula_26 and formula_41 now imply that

:formula_42

This account is a straightforward classical method found in many text books, for example in Burkill, Apostol and Rudin.
Although the derivation above is elementary, the approach can also be viewed from a more conceptual perspective so that the result becomes more apparent. Indeed the difference operators formula_43 commute and formula_44 tend to formula_45 as formula_46 tends to 0, with a similar statement for second order operators. Here, for formula_47 a vector in the plane and formula_48 a directional vector formula_49 or formula_50, the difference operator is defined by

:formula_51

By the fundamental theorem of calculus for formula_52 functions formula_13 on an open interval formula_54 with formula_55

:formula_56

Hence

:formula_57.

This is a generalized version of the mean value theorem. Recall that the elementary discussion on maxima or minima for real-valued functions implies that if formula_13 is continuous on formula_59 and differentiable on formula_23, then there is a point formula_61 in formula_23 such that

:formula_63

For vector-valued functions with formula_64 a finite-dimensional normed space, there is no analogue of the equality above, indeed it fails. But since formula_65, the inequality above is a useful substitute. Moreover, using the pairing of the dual of formula_64 with its dual norm, yields the following inequality:

:formula_67.

These versions of the mean valued theorem are discussed in Rudin, Hörmander and elsewhere.

For formula_13 a formula_69 function on an open set in the plane, define formula_70 and formula_71. Furthermore for formula_72 set

:formula_73.

Then for formula_74 in the open set, the generalized mean value theorem can be applied twice:

:formula_75

Thus formula_76 tends to formula_77 as formula_46 tends to 0. The same argument shows that formula_79 tends to formula_80. Hence, since the difference operators commute, so do the partial differential operators formula_81 and formula_82, as claimed.

Remark. By two applications of the classical mean value theorem,

:formula_83

for some formula_84 and formula_85 in formula_86. Thus the first elementary proof can be reinterpreted using difference operators. Conversely, instead of using the generalized mean value theorem in the second proof, the classical mean valued theorem could be used.

== Proof of Clairaut&#x27;s theorem using iterated integrals ==
The properties of repeated Riemann integrals of a continuous function on a compact rectangle are easily established. The uniform continuity of implies immediately that the functions formula_87 and formula_88 are continuous. It follows that

:formula_89;

moreover it is immediate that the iterated integral is positive if is positive. The equality above is a simple case of Fubini&#x27;s theorem, involving no measure theory. proves it in a straightforward way using Riemann approximating sums corresponding to subdivisions of a rectangle into smaller rectangles.

To prove Clairaut&#x27;s theorem, assume is a differentiable function on an open set , for which the mixed second partial derivatives and exist and are continuous. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus twice,

:formula_90

Similarly

:formula_91

The two iterated integrals are therefore equal. On the other hand, since is continuous, the second iterated integral can be performed by first integrating over and then afterwards over . But then the iterated integral of on must vanish. However, if the iterated integral of a continuous function function vanishes for all rectangles, then must be identically zero; for otherwise or would be strictly positive at some point and therefore by continuity on a rectangle, which is not possible. Hence must vanish identically, so that everywhere.

== Sufficiency of twice-differentiability ==
A weaker condition than the continuity of second partial derivatives (which is implied by the latter) which suffices to ensure symmetry is that all partial derivatives are themselves differentiable. Another strengthening of the theorem, in which &quot;existence&quot; of the permuted mixed partial is asserted, was provided by Peano in a short 1890 note on Mathesis:

: &quot;If formula_92 is defined on an open set formula_93; formula_94 and formula_95 exist everywhere on formula_96; formula_97 is continuous at formula_98, and if formula_99 exists in a neighborhood of formula_100, then formula_101 exists at formula_102 and formula_103.&quot;

== Distribution theory formulation ==

The theory of distributions (generalized functions) eliminates analytic problems with the symmetry. The derivative of an integrable function can always be defined as a distribution, and symmetry of mixed partial derivatives always holds as an equality of distributions. The use of formal integration by parts to define differentiation of distributions puts the symmetry question back onto the test functions, which are smooth and certainly satisfy this symmetry. In more detail (where &quot;f&quot; is a distribution, written as an operator on test functions, and &quot;φ&quot; is a test function),
: formula_104

Another approach, which defines the Fourier transform of a function, is to note that on such transforms partial derivatives become multiplication operators that commute much more obviously.

== Requirement of continuity ==
The symmetry may be broken if the function fails to have differentiable partial derivatives, which is possible if Clairaut&#x27;s theorem is not satisfied (the second partial derivatives are not continuous).
An example of non-symmetry is the function (due to Peano)
This can be visualized by the polar form formula_105; it is everywhere continuous, but its derivatives at cannot be computed algebraically. Rather, the limit of difference quotients shows that formula_106, so the graph formula_107 has a horizontal tangent plane at , and the partial derivatives formula_108 exist and are everywhere continuous. However, the second partial derivatives are not continuous at , and the symmetry fails. In fact, along the &quot;x&quot;-axis the &quot;y&quot;-derivative is formula_109, and so:
:formula_110

In contrast, along the &quot;y&quot;-axis the &quot;x&quot;-derivative formula_111, and so formula_112. That is, formula_113 at , although the mixed partial derivatives do exist, and at every other point the symmetry does hold.

The above function, written in polar coordinates, can be expressed as
:formula_114

showing that the function oscillates four times when traveling once around an arbitrarily small loop containing the origin. Intuitively, therefore, the local behavior of the function at (0, 0) cannot be described as a quadratic form, and the Hessian matrix thus fails to be symmetric.

In general, the interchange of limiting operations need not commute. Given two variables near and two limiting processes on
:formula_115

corresponding to making &quot;h&quot; → 0 first, and to making &quot;k&quot; → 0 first. It can matter, looking at the first-order terms, which is applied first. This leads to the construction of pathological examples in which second derivatives are non-symmetric. This kind of example belongs to the theory of real analysis where the pointwise value of functions matters. When viewed as a distribution the second partial derivative&#x27;s values can be changed at an arbitrary set of points as long as this has Lebesgue measure 0. Since in the example the Hessian is symmetric everywhere except , there is no contradiction with the fact that the Hessian, viewed as a Schwartz distribution, is symmetric.

== In Lie theory ==
Consider the first-order differential operators &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot; to be infinitesimal operators on Euclidean space. That is, &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot; in a sense generates the one-parameter group of translations parallel to the &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;-axis. These groups commute with each other, and therefore the infinitesimal generators do also; the Lie bracket

: [&quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;D&quot;&quot;j&quot;] = 0

is this property&#x27;s reflection. In other words, the Lie derivative of one coordinate with respect to another is zero.

== Application to differential forms ==
The Clairaut-Schwarz theorem is the key fact needed to prove that for every formula_116 (or at least twice differentiable) differential form formula_117, the second exterior derivative vanishes: formula_118. This implies that every differentiable exact form (i.e., a form formula_119 such that formula_120 for some form formula_121) is closed (i.e., formula_122), since formula_123.

In the middle of the 18th century, the theory of differential forms was first studied in the simplest case of 1-forms in the plane, i.e. formula_124, where formula_125 and formula_126 are functions in the plane. The study of 1-forms and the differentials of functions began with Clairaut&#x27;s papers in 1739 and 1740. At that stage his investigations were interpreted as ways of solving ordinary differential equations. Formally Clairaut showed that a 1-form formula_127 on an open rectangle is closed, i.e. formula_128, if and only formula_121 has the form formula_24 for some function formula_13 in the disk. The solution for formula_13 can be written by Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula

:formula_133

while if formula_134, the closed property formula_135 is the identity formula_136. (In modern language this is one version of the Poincaré lemma.)

<text>Diphenhydramine, sold under the brand name [[Benadryl]] among others, is an antihistamine and sedative. It is a first-generation H1-antihistamine and it works by blocking certain effects of histamine, which produces its antihistamine and sedative effects. Diphenhydramine is also a potent anticholinergic. It is mainly used to treat allergies, insomnia, and symptoms of the common cold. It is also less commonly used for tremors in parkinsonism, and nausea. It is taken by mouth, injected into a vein, injected into a muscle, or applied to the skin. Maximal effect is typically around two hours after a dose, and effects can last for up to seven hours.

Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, and upset stomach. There is no clear risk of harm when used during pregnancy; however, use during breastfeeding is not recommended.

It was developed by George Rieveschl and put into commercial use in 1946. It is available as a generic medication, In 2022, it was the 258th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

Its sedative and deliriant effects have led to some cases of recreational use.

==Medical uses==
Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine used to treat several conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, motion sickness, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Diphenhydramine also has local anesthetic properties, and has been used as such in people allergic to common local anesthetics such as lidocaine.

===Allergies===
Diphenhydramine is effective in the treatment of allergies. , it was the most commonly used antihistamine for acute allergic reactions in the emergency department.

By injection, it is often used in addition to epinephrine for anaphylaxis, although its use for this purpose had not been properly studied. Its use is only recommended once acute symptoms have improved.

Topical formulations of diphenhydramine are available, including creams, lotions, gels, sprays, and eye drops. These are used to relieve itching and have the advantage of causing fewer systemic effects (&quot;e.g.&quot;, drowsiness) than oral forms.

===Movement disorders===
Diphenhydramine is used to treat akathisia and parkinsonism caused by antipsychotics. It is also used to treat acute dystonia including torticollis and oculogyric crisis caused by typical antipsychotics.

===Sleep===
Because of its sedative properties, diphenhydramine is widely used in nonprescription sleep aids for insomnia. The drug is an ingredient in several products sold as sleep aids, either alone or in combination with other ingredients such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) in Tylenol PM and ibuprofen in Advil PM. Diphenhydramine can cause minor psychological dependence. Diphenhydramine has also been used as an anxiolytic.

Diphenhydramine has also been used off-prescription by parents in an attempt to make their children sleep and to sedate them on long-distance flights. This has been met with criticism, both by doctors and by members of the airline industry, because sedating passengers may put them at risk if they cannot react efficiently to emergencies, and because the drug&#x27;s side effects, especially the chance of a paradoxical reaction, may make some users hyperactive. Addressing such use, the Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital argued, in a 2009 article, &quot;Using a medication for your convenience is never an indication for medication in a child.&quot;

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine&#x27;s 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of diphenhydramine in the treatment of insomnia, because of poor effectiveness and low quality of evidence. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of diphenhydramine for insomnia.

===Nausea===
Diphenhydramine also has antiemetic properties, which make it useful in treating the nausea that occurs in vertigo and motion sickness. However, when taken above recommended doses, it can cause nausea (especially above 200 mg).

===Special populations===
Diphenhydramine is secreted in breast milk. It is expected that low doses of diphenhydramine taken occasionally will cause no adverse effects in breastfed infants. Large doses and long-term use may affect the baby or reduce breast milk supply, especially when combined with sympathomimetic drugs, such as pseudoephedrine, or before the establishment of lactation. A single bedtime dose after the last feeding of the day may minimize the harmful effects of the medication on the baby and the milk supply. Still, non-sedating antihistamines are preferred.

Paradoxical reactions to diphenhydramine have been documented, particularly in children, and it may cause excitation instead of sedation.

Topical diphenhydramine is sometimes used especially for people in hospice. This use is without indication and topical diphenhydramine should not be used as treatment for nausea because research has not shown that this therapy is more effective than others.

===Anxiety===
Diphenhydramine (as Benadryl) is not typically used to treat anxiety because its long-term use may cause adverse effects, such as memory loss, especially in the elderly. Benadryl is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating anxiety. On the other hand, hydroxyzine, a first generation antihistamine that lacks significant anticholinergic effects may be used to treat anxiety, although benzodiazepines and antidepressants are considered more effective by most clinicians. The mild anxiolytic effects of hydroxyzine are mostly due to its weak but significant activity as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, a common target of most antidepressant drugs (as well as certain other antihistamines like cyproheptadine and promethazine). Diphenhydramine is not known to bind to the 5-HT2A receptor, though it is a weak antagonist of the related 5-HT2C receptor, which is another target of antidepressant drugs and has a significant role in mood and anxiety. 

==Adverse effects==
The most prominent side effects are dizziness and sleepiness. 

Diphenhydramine is a potent anticholinergic agent and potential deliriant in higher doses. This activity is responsible for the side effects of dry mouth and throat, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, urinary retention, constipation, and, at high doses, hallucinations or delirium. Other side effects include motor impairment (ataxia), flushed skin, blurred vision at nearpoint owing to lack of accommodation (cycloplegia), abnormal sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), sedation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature (in general, in the hands and/or feet), temporary erectile dysfunction, and excitability, and although it can be used to treat nausea, higher doses may cause vomiting. Diphenhydramine in overdose may occasionally result in QT prolongation.

Some individuals experience an allergic reaction to diphenhydramine in the form of hives.

Conditions such as restlessness or akathisia can worsen from increased levels of diphenhydramine, especially with recreational dosages. Normal doses of diphenhydramine, like other first generation antihistamines, can also make symptoms of restless legs syndrome worse.
As diphenhydramine is extensively metabolized by the liver, caution should be exercised when giving the drug to individuals with hepatic impairment.

Anticholinergic use later in life is associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia among older people. Drowsiness, memory loss, confusion, dry mouth or constipation may also occur in elderly people.

==Contraindications==
Diphenhydramine is contraindicated in premature infants and neonates, as well as people who are breastfeeding. It is a pregnancy Category B drug. Diphenhydramine has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effect of antihistamines.

==Overdose==
Diphenhydramine is one of the most commonly misused over-the-counter drugs in the United States. Overdose symptoms may include 
* Abdominal pain
* Abnormal speech (inaudibility, forced speech, etc.)
* Acute megacolon
* Anxiety/nervousness
* Coma
* Delirium
* Disorientation
* Dissociation
* Dysphoria
* Extreme drowsiness
* Flushed skin
* Hallucinations (auditory, visual, tactile, etc.)
* Heart palpitations
* Inability to urinate
* Motor disturbances
* Muscle spasms
* Seizures
* Severe dizziness
* Severe mouth and throat dryness
* Tremors
* Vomiting
Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2–18 hours, and in general, is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general precise plasma levels do not appear to provide useful relevant clinical information. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as &quot;torsades de pointes&quot;.
No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in people who are prone to these symptoms.

==Interactions==
Alcohol may increase the drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDiphenhydramine and Alcohol / Food Interactions - Drugs.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Diphenhydramine, while traditionally known as an antagonist, acts primarily as an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. It is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic agents. By reversing the effects of histamine on the capillaries, it can reduce the intensity of allergic symptoms. It also crosses the blood–brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 receptors centrally. Its effects on central H1 receptors cause drowsiness.

Diphenhydramine is a potent antimuscarinic (a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) and, as such, at high doses can cause anticholinergic syndrome. The utility of diphenhydramine as an antiparkinson agent is the result of its blocking properties on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain.

Diphenhydramine also acts as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, which is responsible for its actions as a local anesthetic. Diphenhydramine has also been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. It has been shown to be a potentiator of analgesia induced by morphine, but not by endogenous opioids, in rats. The drug has also been found to act as an inhibitor of histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT).

===Pharmacokinetics===
Oral bioavailability of diphenhydramine is in the range of 40% to 60%, and peak plasma concentration occurs about 2 to 3 hours after administration. Diphenhydramine, available in various salt forms, such as citrate, hydrochloride, and salicylate, exhibits distinct molecular weights and pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and diphenhydramine citrate possess molecular weights of and , respectively. These variations in molecular weight influence the dissolution rates and absorption characteristics of each salt form.

The primary route of metabolism is two successive demethylations of the tertiary amine. The resulting primary amine is further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. Diphenhydramine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.

The elimination half-life of diphenhydramine has not been fully elucidated, but appears to range between 2.4 and 9.3 hours in healthy adults. A 1985 review of antihistamine pharmacokinetics found that the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine ranged between 3.4 and 9.3 hours across five studies, with a median elimination half-life of 4.3 hours. A subsequent 1990 study found that the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine was 5.4 hours in children, 9.2 hours in young adults, and 13.5 hours in the elderly. A 1998 study found a half-life of 4.1 ± 0.3 hours in young men, 7.4 ± 3.0 hours in elderly men, 4.4 ± 0.3 hours in young women, and 4.9 ± 0.6 hours in elderly women. In a 2018 study in children and adolescents, the half-life of diphenhydramine was 8 to 9 hours.

==Chemistry==

===Detection in body fluids===
Diphenhydramine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can be used with electron ionization on full scan mode as a screening test. GC-MS or GC-NDP can be used for quantification. Rapid urine drug screens using immunoassays based on the principle of competitive binding may show false-positive methadone results for people having ingested diphenhydramine. Quantification can be used to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a death investigation.

== History ==

In 1943, diphenhydramine was discovered by chemist George Rieveschl and one of his students, Fred Huber, while they were conducting research into muscle relaxants at the University of Cincinnati. Huber first synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl then worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the US FDA.

In the 1960s, diphenhydramine was found to weakly inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This discovery led to a search for viable antidepressants with similar structures and fewer side effects, culminating in the invention of fluoxetine (Prozac), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). A similar search had previously led to the synthesis of the first SSRI, zimelidine, from brompheniramine, also an antihistamine.

In 1975, diphenhydramine was still available only by prescription in the US and required medical supervision.

== Society and culture ==
=== Marketing ===

Diphenhydramine is sold under the brand name Benadryl by McNeil Consumer Healthcare in the US, UK, Canada, and South Africa. Trade names in other countries include Dimedrol, Daedalon, Nytol, and Vivinox. It is also available as a generic medication.

Procter &amp; Gamble markets an over-the-counter formulation of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid under the brand ZzzQuil.

Prestige Brands markets an over-the-counter formulation of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid in the US under the name Sominex.

=== Cultural impact ===

Diphenhydramine is deemed to have limited abuse potential in the United States owing to its potentially serious side-effect profile and limited euphoric effects and is not a controlled substance. Since 2002, the US FDA has required special labeling warning against the use of multiple products that contain diphenhydramine. In some jurisdictions, diphenhydramine is often present in postmortem specimens collected during investigation of sudden infant deaths; the drug may play a role in these events.

Diphenhydramine is among prohibited and controlled substances in the Republic of Zambia, and travelers are advised not to bring the drug into the country. Several Americans have been detained by the Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission for possession of Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications containing diphenhydramine.

====Recreational use====
Although diphenhydramine is widely used and generally considered to be safe for occasional usage, multiple cases of abuse and addiction have been documented. Because the drug is cheap and sold over the counter in most countries, adolescents without access to more sought-after illicit drugs are particularly at risk. People with mental health problems—especially those with schizophrenia—are also prone to abuse the drug, which is self-administered in large doses to treat extrapyramidal symptoms caused by the use of antipsychotics.

Recreational users report calming effects, mild euphoria, and hallucinations as the desired effects of the drug. Research has shown that antimuscarinic agents, including diphenhydramine, &quot;may have antidepressant and mood-elevating properties&quot;. A study conducted on adult males with a history of sedative abuse found that subjects who were administered a high dose (400 mg) of diphenhydramine reported a desire to take the drug again, despite also reporting negative effects, such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, tremors, and blurred vision.

In 2020, an Internet challenge emerged on the social media platform TikTok involving deliberately overdosing on diphenhydramine; dubbed the Benadryl challenge, the challenge encourages participants to consume dangerous amounts of Benadryl to film the resultant psychoactive effects and has been implicated in several hospitalisations and at least two deaths.

<text>Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BRCA1 () gene. Orthologs are common in other vertebrate species, whereas invertebrate genomes may encode a more distantly related gene. &quot;BRCA1&quot; is a human tumor suppressor gene (also known as a caretaker gene) and is responsible for repairing DNA.

&quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; are unrelated proteins, but both are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where they help repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. They are involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. If &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; itself is damaged by a BRCA mutation, damaged DNA is not repaired properly, and this increases the risk for breast cancer. &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; have been described as &quot;breast cancer susceptibility genes&quot; and &quot;breast cancer susceptibility proteins&quot;. The predominant allele has a normal, tumor-suppressive function whereas high penetrance mutations in these genes cause a loss of tumor-suppressive function which correlates with an increased risk of breast cancer.

&quot;BRCA1&quot; combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors and signal transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the &quot;BRCA1&quot;-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC). The &quot;BRCA1&quot; protein associates with RNA polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes. Thus, this protein plays a role in transcription, and DNA repair of double-strand DNA breaks ubiquitination, transcriptional regulation as well as other functions.

Methods to test for the likelihood of a patient with mutations in &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; developing cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics. Myriad&#x27;s business model of offering the diagnostic test exclusively led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500 million in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to obtain second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; lawsuit.

==Discovery==
The chromosomal location of &quot;BRCA1&quot; was discovered by Mary-Claire King&#x27;s team at UC Berkeley in 1990. After an international race to refine the precise location of &quot;BRCA1&quot;, the gene was cloned in 1994 by scientists at University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics.

==Gene==

&quot;BRCA1&quot; orthologs have been identified in most vertebrates for which complete genome data are available.

==Protein structure==
The BRCA1 protein contains the following domains:
* Zinc finger, C3HC4 type (RING finger)
* BRCA1 C Terminus (BRCT) domain
This protein also contains nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signal motifs.

The human BRCA1 protein consists of four major protein domains; the Znf C3HC4- RING domain, the BRCA1 serine domain and two BRCT domains. These domains encode approximately 27% of BRCA1 protein. There are six known isoforms of BRCA1, with isoforms 1 and 2 comprising 1863 amino acids each.

BRCA1 is unrelated to BRCA2, i.e. they are not homologs or paralogs.
===Zinc RING finger domain===

The RING motif, a Zn finger found in eukaryotic peptides, is 40–60 amino acids long and consists of eight conserved metal-binding residues, two quartets of cysteine or histidine residues that coordinate two zinc atoms. This motif contains a short anti-parallel beta-sheet, two zinc-binding loops and a central alpha helix in a small domain. This RING domain interacts with associated proteins, including BARD1, which also contains a RING motif, to form a heterodimer. The BRCA1 RING motif is flanked by alpha helices formed by residues 8–22 and 81–96 of the BRCA1 protein. It interacts with a homologous region in BARD1 also consisting of a RING finger flanked by two alpha-helices formed from residues 36–48 and 101–116. These four helices combine to form a heterodimerization interface and stabilize the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer complex. Additional stabilization is achieved by interactions between adjacent residues in the flanking region and hydrophobic interactions. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, implying that the formation of a stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression.

The RING domain is an important element of ubiquitin E3 ligases, which catalyze protein ubiquitination. Ubiquitin is a small regulatory protein found in all tissues that direct proteins to compartments within the cell. BRCA1 polypeptides, in particular, Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains are dispersed throughout the resting cell nucleus, but at the start of DNA replication, they gather in restrained groups that also contain BRCA2 and BARD1. BARD1 is thought to be involved in the recognition and binding of protein targets for ubiquitination. It attaches to proteins and labels them for destruction. Ubiquitination occurs via the BRCA1 fusion protein and is abolished by zinc chelation. The enzyme activity of the fusion protein is dependent on the proper folding of the RING domain.

===Serine cluster domain===

BRCA1 serine cluster domain (SCD) spans amino acids 1280–1524. A portion of the domain is located in exons 11–13. High rates of mutation occur in exons 11–13. Reported phosphorylation sites of BRCA1 are concentrated in the SCD, where they are phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases both in vitro and in vivo. ATM/ATR are kinases activated by DNA damage. Mutation of serine residues may affect localization of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage and DNA damage response function.

===BRCT domains===

The dual repeat BRCT domain of the BRCA1 protein is an elongated structure approximately 70 Å long and 30–35 Å wide. The 85–95 amino acid domains in BRCT can be found as single modules or as multiple tandem repeats containing two domains. Both of these possibilities can occur in a single protein in a variety of different conformations. The C-terminal BRCT region of the BRCA1 protein is essential for repair of DNA, transcription regulation and tumor-suppressor function. In BRCA1 the dual tandem repeat BRCT domains are arranged in a head-to-tail-fashion in the three-dimensional structure, burying 1600 Å of hydrophobic, solvent-accessible surface area in the interface. These all contribute to the tightly packed knob-in-hole structure that comprises the interface. These homologous domains interact to control cellular responses to DNA damage. A missense mutation at the interface of these two proteins can perturb the cell cycle, resulting a greater risk of developing cancer.

==Function and mechanism==

BRCA1 is part of a complex that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. The strands of the DNA double helix are continuously breaking as they become damaged. Sometimes only one strand is broken, sometimes both strands are broken simultaneously. DNA cross-linking agents are an important source of chromosome/DNA damage. Double-strand breaks occur as intermediates after the crosslinks are removed, and indeed, biallelic mutations in &quot;BRCA1&quot; have been identified to be responsible for Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group S (FA-S), a genetic disease associated with hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. BRCA1 is part of a protein complex that repairs DNA when both strands are broken. When this happens, it is difficult for the repair mechanism to &quot;know&quot; how to replace the correct DNA sequence, and there are multiple ways to attempt the repair. The double-strand repair mechanism in which BRCA1 participates is homology-directed repair, where the repair proteins copy the identical sequence from the intact sister chromatid. FA-S is almost always a lethal condition in utero; only a handful cases of biallelic BRCA1 mutations have been reported in literature despite the high carrier frequencies in the Ashkenazim, and none since 2013.

In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with RAD51 during repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These breaks can be caused by natural radiation or other exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material (homologous recombination, e.g., &quot;crossing over&quot; during meiosis). The BRCA2 protein, which has a function similar to that of BRCA1, also interacts with the RAD51 protein. By influencing DNA damage repair, these three proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome.

BRCA1 is also involved in another type of DNA repair, termed mismatch repair. BRCA1 interacts with the DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2. MSH2, MSH6, PARP and some other proteins involved in single-strand repair are reported to be elevated in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors.

A protein called valosin-containing protein (VCP, also known as p97) plays a role to recruit BRCA1 to the damaged DNA sites. After ionizing radiation, VCP is recruited to DNA lesions and cooperates with the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 to orchestrate assembly of signaling complexes for efficient DSB repair. BRCA1 interacts with VCP. BRCA1 also interacts with c-Myc, and other proteins that are critical to maintain genome stability.

BRCA1 directly binds to DNA, with higher affinity for branched DNA structures. This ability to bind to DNA contributes to its ability to inhibit the nuclease activity of the MRN complex as well as the nuclease activity of Mre11 alone. This may explain a role for BRCA1 to promote lower fidelity DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). BRCA1 also colocalizes with γ-H2AX (histone H2AX phosphorylated on serine-139) in DNA double-strand break repair foci, indicating it may play a role in recruiting repair factors.

Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are common environmental sources of DNA cross links that often require repairs mediated by BRCA1 containing pathways.

This DNA repair function is essential; mice with loss-of-function mutations in both BRCA1 alleles are not viable, and as of 2015 only two adults were known to have loss-of-function mutations in both alleles (leading to FA-S); both had congenital or developmental issues, and both had cancer. One was presumed to have survived to adulthood because one of the BRCA1 mutations was hypomorphic.

===Transcription===

BRCA1 was shown to co-purify with the human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme in HeLa extracts, implying it is a component of the holoenzyme. Later research, however, contradicted this assumption, instead showing that the predominant complex including BRCA1 in HeLa cells is a 2 megadalton complex containing SWI/SNF. SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeling complex. Artificial tethering of BRCA1 to chromatin was shown to decondense heterochromatin, though the SWI/SNF interacting domain was not necessary for this role. BRCA1 interacts with the NELF-B (COBRA1) subunit of the NELF complex.

Certain variations of the &quot;BRCA1&quot; gene lead to an increased risk for breast cancer as part of a hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. Researchers have identified hundreds of mutations in the &quot;BRCA1&quot; gene, many of which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Females with an abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have up to an 80% risk of developing breast cancer by age 90; increased risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 55% for females with BRCA1 mutations and about 25% for females with BRCA2 mutations.

These mutations can be changes in one or a small number of DNA base pairs (the building-blocks of DNA), and can be identified with PCR and DNA sequencing.

In some cases, large segments of DNA are rearranged. Those large segments, also called large rearrangements, can be a deletion or a duplication of one or several exons in the gene. Classical methods for mutation detection (sequencing) are unable to reveal these types of mutation. Other methods have been proposed: traditional quantitative PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments (QMPSF). Newer methods have also been recently proposed: heteroduplex analysis (HDA) by multi-capillary electrophoresis or also dedicated oligonucleotides array based on comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH).

Some results suggest that hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter, which has been reported in some cancers, could be considered as an inactivating mechanism for BRCA1 expression.

A mutated &quot;BRCA1&quot; gene usually makes a protein that does not function properly. Researchers believe that the defective BRCA1 protein is unable to help fix DNA damage leading to mutations in other genes. These mutations can accumulate and may allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. Thus, BRCA1 inactivating mutations lead to a predisposition for cancer.

BRCA1 mRNA 3&#x27; UTR can be bound by an miRNA, Mir-17 microRNA. It has been suggested that variations in this miRNA along with Mir-30 microRNA could confer susceptibility to breast cancer.

In addition to breast cancer, mutations in the &quot;BRCA1&quot; gene also increase the risk of ovarian and prostate cancers. Moreover, precancerous lesions (dysplasia) within the fallopian tube have been linked to &quot;BRCA1&quot; gene mutations. Pathogenic mutations anywhere in a model pathway containing BRCA1 and BRCA2 greatly increase risks for a subset of leukemias and lymphomas.

Women who have inherited a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at a greatly elevated risk to develop breast and ovarian cancer. Their risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is so high, and so specific to those cancers, that many mutation carriers choose to have prophylactic surgery. There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity. Major determinants of where BRCA1/2 hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation or the carcinogen. The target tissue may have receptors for the pathogen, may become selectively exposed to an inflammatory process or to a carcinogen. An innate genomic deficit in a tumor suppressor gene impairs normal responses and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets. This theory also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2. A major advantage of this model is that it suggests there may be some options in addition to prophylactic surgery.

As aforementioned, biallelic and homozygous inheritance of the BRCA1 gene leads to FA-S, which is almost always an embryonically lethal condition.

==Low expression of &quot;BRCA1&quot; in breast and ovarian cancers==
BRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers. It has long been noted that loss of BRCA1 activity, either by germ-line mutations or by down-regulation of gene expression, leads to tumor formation in specific target tissues. In particular, decreased BRCA1 expression contributes to both sporadic and inherited breast tumor progression. Reduced expression of BRCA1 is tumorigenic because it plays an important role in the repair of DNA damages, especially double-strand breaks, by the potentially error-free pathway of homologous recombination. Since cells that lack the BRCA1 protein tend to repair DNA damages by alternative more error-prone mechanisms, the reduction or silencing of this protein generates mutations and gross chromosomal rearrangements that can lead to progression to breast cancer.

Similarly, BRCA1 expression is low in the majority (55%) of sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) where EOCs are the most common type of ovarian cancer, representing approximately 90% of ovarian cancers. In serous ovarian carcinomas, a sub-category constituting about 2/3 of EOCs, low BRCA1 expression occurs in more than 50% of cases. Bowtell reviewed the literature indicating that deficient homologous recombination repair caused by BRCA1 deficiency is tumorigenic. In particular this deficiency initiates a cascade of molecular events that sculpt the evolution of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and dictate its response to therapy. Especially noted was that BRCA1 deficiency could be the cause of tumorigenesis whether due to BRCA1 mutation or any other event that causes a deficiency of BRCA1 expression.

In addition to its role in repairing DNA damages, BRCA1 facilitates apoptosis in breast and ovarian cell lines when cells are stressed by agents, including ionizing radiation, that cause DNA damages. Repair of DNA damages and apoptosis are two enzymatic processes essential for maintaining genome integrity in humans. Cells that are deficient in DNA repair tend to accumulate DNA damages, and when such cells are also defective in apoptosis they tend to survive even with excess DNA damage. Replication of DNA in such cells leads to mutations and these mutations may cause cancer. Thus BRCA1 appears to have two roles related to the prevention of cancer, where one role is to promote repair of a specific class of damages and the second role is to induce apoptosis if the level of such DNA damage is beyond the cell&#x27;s repair capability

===Mutation of &quot;BRCA1&quot; in breast and ovarian cancer===
Only about 3%–8% of all women with breast cancer carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Similarly, &quot;BRCA1&quot; mutations are only seen in about 18% of ovarian cancers (13% germline mutations and 5% somatic mutations).

Thus, while BRCA1 expression is low in the majority of these cancers, &quot;BRCA1&quot; mutation is not a major cause of reduced expression. Certain latent viruses, which are frequently detected in breast cancer tumors, can decrease the expression of the BRCA1 gene and cause the development of breast tumors.

===&quot;BRCA1&quot; promoter hypermethylation in breast and ovarian cancer===
&quot;BRCA1&quot; promoter hypermethylation was present in only 13% of unselected primary breast carcinomas. Similarly, &quot;BRCA1&quot; promoter hypermethylation was present in only 5% to 15% of EOC cases.

Thus, while BRCA1 expression is low in these cancers, &quot;BRCA1&quot; promoter methylation is only a minor cause of reduced expression.

===MicroRNA repression of BRCA1 in breast cancers===
There are a number of specific microRNAs, when overexpressed, that directly reduce expression of specific DNA repair proteins (see MicroRNA section DNA repair and cancer) In the case of breast cancer, microRNA-182 (miR-182) specifically targets BRCA1. Breast cancers can be classified based on receptor status or histology, with triple-negative breast cancer (15%–25% of breast cancers), HER2+ (15%–30% of breast cancers), ER+/PR+ (about 70% of breast cancers), and Invasive lobular carcinoma (about 5%–10% of invasive breast cancer). All four types of breast cancer were found to have an average of about 100-fold increase in miR-182, compared to normal breast tissue. In breast cancer cell lines, there is an inverse correlation of BRCA1 protein levels with miR-182 expression. Thus it appears that much of the reduction or absence of BRCA1 in high grade ductal breast cancers may be due to over-expressed miR-182.

In addition to miR-182, a pair of almost identical microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b-5p, also repress BRCA1 expression. These two microRNAs are over-expressed in triple-negative tumors and their over-expression results in BRCA1 inactivation. Thus, miR-146a and/or miR-146b-5p may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these triple-negative breast cancers.

===MicroRNA repression of BRCA1 in ovarian cancers===
In both serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (the precursor lesion to high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC)), and in HG-SOC itself, miR-182 is overexpressed in about 70% of cases. In cells with over-expressed miR-182, BRCA1 remained low, even after exposure to ionizing radiation (which normally raises BRCA1 expression). Thus much of the reduced or absent BRCA1 in HG-SOC may be due to over-expressed miR-182.

Another microRNA known to reduce expression of BRCA1 in ovarian cancer cells is miR-9. Among 58 tumors from patients with stage IIIC or stage IV serous ovarian cancers (HG-SOG), an inverse correlation was found between expressions of miR-9 and BRCA1, so that increased miR-9 may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these ovarian cancers.

===Deficiency of &quot;BRCA1&quot; expression is likely tumorigenic===
DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer, and deficiencies in DNA repair appears to underlie many forms of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage may increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage may also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations may give rise to cancer. The frequent microRNA-induced deficiency of &quot;BRCA1&quot; in breast and ovarian cancers likely contribute to the progression of those cancers.

==Germ-line mutations and founder effect==
All germ-line BRCA1 mutations identified to date have been inherited, suggesting the possibility of a large &quot;founder&quot; effect in which a certain mutation is common to a well-defined population group and can, in theory, be traced back to a common ancestor. Given the complexity of mutation screening for BRCA1, these common mutations may simplify the methods required for mutation screening in certain populations. Analysis of mutations that occur with high frequency also permits the study of their clinical expression. Examples of manifestations of a founder effect are seen among Ashkenazi Jews. Three mutations in BRCA1 have been reported to account for the majority of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with inherited BRCA1-related breast and/or ovarian cancer: 185delAG, 188del11 and 5382insC in the BRCA1 gene. In fact, it has been shown that if a Jewish woman does not carry a BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC founder mutation, it is highly unlikely that a different BRCA1 mutation will be found. Additional examples of founder mutations in BRCA1 are given in Table 1 (mainly derived from).

==Female fertility==
As women age, reproductive performance declines, leading to menopause. This decline is tied to a reduction in the number of ovarian follicles. Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate. The decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age, and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 52. As ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age, there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors, resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions.

Women with a germ-line &quot;BRCA1&quot; mutation appear to have a diminished oocyte reserve and decreased fertility compared to normally aging women. Furthermore, women with an inherited &quot;BRCA1&quot; mutation undergo menopause prematurely. Since BRCA1 is a key DNA repair protein, these findings suggest that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in women with a &quot;BRCA1&quot; defect, and that this repair inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure.

As noted above, the BRCA1 protein plays a key role in homologous recombinational repair. This is the only known cellular process that can accurately repair DNA double-strand breaks. DNA double-strand breaks accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles. Primordial follicles contain oocytes that are at an intermediate (prophase I) stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by which germ cells are formed, and it is likely an adaptation for removing DNA damages, especially double-strand breaks, from germ line DNA. (Also see article Meiosis). Homologous recombinational repair employing BRCA1 is especially promoted during meiosis. It was found that expression of four key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks (&quot;BRCA1, MRE11, RAD51&quot; and &quot;ATM&quot;) decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice, leading to the hypothesis that DNA double-strand break repair is necessary for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a role in ovarian aging.

==Cancer chemotherapy==
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. At diagnosis, almost 70% of persons with NSCLC have locally advanced or metastatic disease. Persons with NSCLC are often treated with therapeutic platinum compounds (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin) that cause inter-strand cross-links in DNA. Among individuals with NSCLC, low expression of &quot;BRCA1&quot; in the primary tumor correlated with improved survival after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This correlation implies that low BRCA1 in cancer, and the consequent low level of DNA repair, causes vulnerability of cancer to treatment by the DNA cross-linking agents. High BRCA1 may protect cancer cells by acting in a pathway that removes the damages in DNA introduced by the platinum drugs. Thus the level of &quot;BRCA1&quot; expression is a potentially important tool for tailoring chemotherapy in lung cancer management.

Level of &quot;BRCA1&quot; expression is also relevant to ovarian cancer treatment. Patients having sporadic ovarian cancer who were treated with platinum drugs had longer median survival times if their &quot;BRCA1&quot; expression was low compared to patients with higher &quot;BRCA1&quot; expression (46 compared to 33 months).

==Patents, enforcement, litigation, and controversy==

A patent application for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer promoting mutations discussed above, as well as methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; over the next year, Myriad, (in collaboration with investigators at Endo Recherche, Inc., HSC Research &amp; Development Limited Partnership, and University of Pennsylvania), isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene and identified key mutations, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and other institutions in 1995. Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; lawsuit. The patents began to expire in 2014.

According to an article published in the journal, &quot;Genetic Medicine&quot;, in 2010, &quot;The patent story outside the United States is more complicated... For example, patents have been obtained but the patents are being ignored by provincial health systems in Canada. In Australia and the UK, Myriad&#x27;s licensee permitted use by health systems but announced a change of plans in August 2008. Only a single mutation has been patented in Myriad&#x27;s lone European-wide patent, although some patents remain under review of an opposition proceeding. In effect, the United States is the only jurisdiction where Myriad&#x27;s strong patent position has conferred sole-provider status.&quot; Peter Meldrum, CEO of Myriad Genetics, has acknowledged that Myriad has &quot;other competitive advantages that may make such [patent] enforcement unnecessary&quot; in Europe.

As with any gene, finding variation in BRCA1 is not hard. The real value comes from understanding what the clinical consequences of any particular variant are. Myriad has a large, proprietary database of such genotype-phenotype correlations. In response, parallel open-source databases are being developed.

Legal decisions surrounding the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents will affect the field of genetic testing in general. A June 2013 article, in &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; (No. 12-398), quoted the US Supreme Court&#x27;s unanimous ruling that, &quot;A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&quot; invalidating Myriad&#x27;s patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature could still be eligible for patent protection. The Federal Court of Australia came to the opposite conclusion, upholding the validity of an Australian Myriad Genetics patent over the BRCA1 gene in February 2013. The Federal Court also rejected an appeal in September 2014. Yvonne D&#x27;Arcy won her case against US-based biotech company Myriad Genetics in the High Court of Australia. In their unanimous decision on October 7, 2015, the &quot;high court found that an isolated nucleic acid, coding for a BRCA1 protein, with specific variations from the norm that are indicative of susceptibility to breast cancer and ovarian cancer was not a &#x27;patentable invention.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Stourport-on-Severn, often shortened to Stourport, is a town and civil parish in the Wyre Forest District of North Worcestershire, England, 4 miles to the south of Kidderminster and downstream on the River Severn from Bewdley. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 20,653.

==History and early growth==

Stourport came into being around the canal basins at the Severn terminus of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which was completed in 1768. In 1772 the junction between the Staffordshire and Worcestershire and the Birmingham Canal was completed and Stourport became one of the principal distributing centres for goods to and from the rest of the West Midlands. The canal terminus was built on meadowland to the south west of the hamlet of Lower Mitton. The terminus was first called Stourmouth and then Newport, with the final name of Stourport settled on by 1771.

The population of Stourport rose from about 12 in the 1760s to 1300 in 1795. In 1771 John Wesley had called Stourport a &quot;well built village&quot; but by 1788 he noted that &quot;where twenty years ago there was but one house; now there are two or three streets, and as trade increases it will probably grow into a considerable town&quot;. In 1790 he found the town &quot;twice as large as two years ago&quot;.

With the completion of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in 1816, the revenue of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal plunged sharply and from 1812 the population of Stourport scarcely rose, with many male workers leaving the town.

In the area close to Stourport there are several large manor and country houses, among which Witley Court, Astley Hall, Pool House, Areley Hall, Hartlebury and Abberley Hall (with its clock tower) are particularly significant. Hartlebury was the residence of the Bishops of Worcester from the early 13th century until 2007, and Astley Hall was the home of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who died here in 1947.

The George Gilbert Scott church replaced an earlier brick church of 1782 by James Rose. This building was never finished, and after suffering storm damage, had to be partly demolished. The current St. Michael&#x27;s church sits partially within its ruins. The Font was salvaged from the ruins of the old church, and is still used in the current building.

In 1944, the town was the location of a famous address to US army troops by general George S. Patton. Stourport Civic Centre, which is now used as an events venue, was completed in 1966.

In 1968 the Transport Act designated the canal a &quot;cruise way&quot; for pleasure purposes.

The town is the birthplace of singer-songwriter Clifford T. Ward.

<text>Mark Steven Kirk (born September 15, 1959) is an American retired politician and attorney who served as a United States senator from Illinois from 2010 to 2017, and as the United States representative for Illinois&#x27;s 10th congressional district from 2001 to 2010. A member of the Republican Party, Kirk describes himself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. To date, he is the last Republican to serve Illinois in the U.S. Senate.

Born in Champaign, Illinois, Kirk graduated from Cornell University, the London School of Economics, and Georgetown University Law Center. He practiced law throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He joined the United States Navy Reserve as a Direct Commission Officer in the Intelligence career field in 1989 and was recalled to active duty for the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. He participated in Operation Northern Watch in Iraq the following year. He attained the rank of Commander and retired from the Navy Reserve in 2013.

Kirk was elected to the House in 2000. During his fifth term in November 2010, he won two concurrent elections: to finish the final months of former Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s term and to serve the next six-year term. He was sworn in on November 29, 2010, and began a six-year Senate term on January 3, 2011. In January 2012, Kirk suffered a stroke; almost a full year passed before he returned to his senatorial duties. In 2016, Kirk ran for re-election to a second full term, but was defeated by Democrat Tammy Duckworth.

==Early life and education==

Kirk was born in Champaign, Illinois, the son of Judith Ann (Brady) and Francis Gabriel &quot;Frank&quot; Kirk. After graduating from New Trier East High School in 1977 he attended Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois, for two years, before briefly attending the Autonomous University of Mexico and subsequently transferring to Cornell University, where he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a B.A. in History. While at Cornell University, Kirk served as the president of The Seal and Serpent Society. Kirk later obtained a master&#x27;s degree from the London School of Economics and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Georgetown University Law Center.

==Early career==
While Kirk was an undergraduate student at Cornell University he held a work–study job supervising a play group at the Forest Home Chapel nursery school. After getting his master&#x27;s degree, Kirk taught for one year at a private school in London. He later stated in speeches and interviews that he had been a nursery and middle school teacher. A leader at the church which housed the nursery school expressed her belief that Kirk overstated his role there, saying Kirk was &quot;just an additional pair of hands to help a primary teaching person.&quot; In discussing problems in the educational system early in his congressional career, Kirk addressed the brevity of his teaching career: &quot;I did leave the teaching profession, but if we had addressed some of the teacher development issues, which I want to raise with you, I might have stayed.&quot;

After college, Kirk worked in Congressman John Porter&#x27;s office, ultimately becoming chief of staff. After leaving Capitol Hill in 1990, he worked at the World Bank and as an aide at the State Department on the Central American peace process. Kirk spent two years practicing international law and four years as counsel to the House International Relations Committee.

==Military service==
Kirk was commissioned as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve in 1989.

In 1999, Kirk was recalled to active duty in Operation Allied Force for the bombing of Yugoslavia. He served from April 10 to June 6, 1999, as the intelligence officer of VAQ-209. VAQ-209 was combined with three other EA-6B squadrons to form an ad hoc unit called Electronic Attack Wing Aviano, Italy. VAQ-140 had tactical command of the combined unit. In May 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association bestowed the organization&#x27;s Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Award to Intelligence Division Electronic Attack Wing Aviano, Italy.

In March and April 2000, Kirk trained with an EC-130 squadron based in Turkey. Kirk took a flight over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, which enforced a no-fly zone over the northern section of Iraq. In a speech on the floor of the House in 2003, Kirk stated: &quot;The last time I was in Iraq I was in uniform, flying at 20,000 feet, and the Iraqi Air Defense network was shooting at us&quot;. Kirk later clarified his statement, indicating that there is no record of his aircraft being fired upon and that he had incorrectly recalled the incident.

During his tenure in the military, Kirk was twice counseled by the Pentagon, after incidents in which he was accused of conducting political business while on duty. On one occasion Kirk commented on Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s arrest and posted a tweet while on duty with the Navy in Afghanistan. According to the Pentagon, Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules before returning to active duty. Kirk denied that he had ever improperly mixed politics with his military service.

Kirk served three individual two-week reserve deployments in Afghanistan, with the latest concluding in September 2011.

Kirk retired from the Navy Reserve in May 2013, after 23 years of service. A formal military retirement ceremony was held for Kirk on December 16, 2014.

===Awards===
In the official photograph of his retirement ceremony, Kirk&#x27;s awards include:

*Defense Meritorious Service Medal
*Joint Services Commendation Medal
*Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal
*Joint Service Achievement Medal
*Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal
*Navy Unit Commendation
*Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation with Service Star
*National Defense Service Medal
*Kosovo Campaign Medal
*Global War on Terrorism Service Medal
*Armed Forces Reserve Medal with &quot;M&quot; device
*NATO Medal for the former Yugoslavia
* NATO Medal for Kosovo

His uniform also displays the Navy Information Dominance Officer badge and the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification Badge.

In 2010, Kirk corrected statements he had made about being awarded &quot;Navy Intelligence Officer of the Year&quot; after it was brought to the media&#x27;s attention by his Democratic opponent, Alexi Giannoulias. In a 2002 House committee hearing recorded by C-SPAN, Kirk said, &quot;I was the Navy&#x27;s Intelligence Officer of the Year&quot;, an achievement he said gave him special qualifications to discuss national security spending. In May 2010, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Kirk&#x27;s claim to having been named the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence Officer of the Year&quot; was erroneous. The National Military Intelligence Association gave the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Award to the entire Intelligence Division Electronic Attack Wing at Aviano. Kirk was the lead intelligence officer for VAQ-209, one of the four squadrons assigned to the Electronic Attack Wing. VAQ-140 had tactical command. Kirk later apologized for this and other errors, including a claim made by his office of having participated in Operation Desert Storm when in fact he did not.

On June 7, 2010, Medal of Honor recipient and advocate of Veteran&#x27;s benefits, Allen Lynch, deemed Mark Kirk&#x27;s apologies adequate, and further commented: &quot;To me, in my opinion, it&#x27;s just a bunch of nit picking. Plus, he&#x27;s done a Christ ton for veterans. So I think this is being blown way out of proportion&quot;.

==Early political career==
Kirk worked on the staff of John Porter, the congressman for Illinois&#x27;s 10th congressional district. From 1991 to 1993, Kirk was the Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State in the U.S. State Department. Kirk was an attorney for Baker &amp; McKenzie from 1993 to 1995. In 1995 Kirk was named as a counsel to the House International Relations Committee. He remained counsel to the House International Relations Committee until 1999.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Kirk was elected in 2000 to succeed the retiring Porter. He won with 51% of the vote against Democrat Lauren Beth Gash, and was reelected by comfortable margins in 2002 and 2004. He defeated Democrat Dan Seals by a seven points in 2006, defeating him again by the same margin in a 2008 rematch.

===Tenure===
During his time in the House, Kirk compiled a centrist voting record, tending to vote more liberally on social issues and more conservatively on foreign policy issues.
Kirk was a member of the House Iran Working Group, the founder and co-chair of the House U.S.-China Working Group, the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, the co-chair of the Albanian Issues Caucus in ex Yugoslavia, and chair of The Tuesday Group, a group of moderate Republicans in the U.S. House. During his House tenure, he was a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

Kirk was responsible for an amendment in 2004 which requires the Congressional Budget Office to annually publish a comparison of projected spending on entitlements with actual spending for the previous year. He also fought against spending on the Alaska &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; and pushed for reforms in the intelligence community.

In 2005, Kirk stated that he was not opposed to the immigration process in the United States discriminating against young Arab males from &quot;terrorist-producing states&quot;. He stated, &quot;I think that when we look at the threat that&#x27;s out there, young men between, say, the ages of 18 and 25 from a couple of countries, I believe a certain amount of intense scrutiny should be placed on them.&quot;

In 2006, Kirk pushed for an expansion of O&#x27;Hare and worked with Rahm Emanuel on a package to clean up Lake Michigan.

In June 2008, Kirk introduced H.R. 6257 to reinstate the assault weapons ban of 1994. The bill was co-sponsored by fellow Republicans: Mike Castle, Mike Ferguson, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Chris Shays. Four years earlier, in February 2004, Kirk had been among 11 Republican and 129 Democratic co-sponsors of H.R. 3831 to reauthorize the ban. Both bills died in committee.

In 2009, Kirk voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act.

==United States Senate==
===Elections===
====2010====

On July 20, 2009, Kirk announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Roland Burris, which had been held by Barack Obama before his election as president. On February 2, 2010, Kirk won the Republican primary with 56.6 percent of the vote; no other candidate had as much as 20 percent. He ran against Democratic nominee Alexi Giannoulias, Green Party nominee LeAlan Jones, and Libertarian nominee Mike Labno. During the Illinois U.S. Senate election campaign in 2010, Kirk and Giannoulias were in a hotly contested debate. Kirk defeated Giannoulias in the election for the full six-year term, getting 48% to Giannoulias&#x27;s 46%. During the campaign, Kirk said he had previously voted for emissions trading legislation &quot;because it was in the narrow interests of my congressional district&quot;, but that as a representative of the entire state of Illinois, &quot;I would vote no on that bill.&quot;

In 2012, Kirk&#x27;s ex-wife accused him of concealing a payment of $143,000 to a former girlfriend, Dodie McCracken, who had worked on his 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. The Federal Election Commission dismissed allegations that the Kirk campaign had hidden the payments, saying they did not need to be disclosed because the girlfriend worked as a subcontractor on the campaign.

====2016====

Having suffered a stroke in 2012 there was speculation he would resign, but in June 2013, Kirk confirmed that he was planning to run for re-election. In November 2014, Kirk reiterated his plans to seek re-election. Kirk defeated fellow Republican James Marter in the primary election. He faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth in the general election.

Kirk&#x27;s campaign purchased television air time to advertise his opposition to admitting refugees to the United States &quot;until it can be done safely&quot;.

In a televised debate on October 27, 2016, Kirk, still recovering from a severe stroke, responded to Duckworth&#x27;s comment about her own military service and her ancestors&#x27; military service by saying, &quot;I&#x27;d forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.&quot; Rep. Duckworth is a military combat veteran who lost both legs while piloting a helicopter during the Iraq war. Her mother was a Thai immigrant and her father&#x27;s ancestors came to America before the Revolutionary War. Due to his comments, the Human Rights Campaign revoked their endorsement of Kirk and switched it to Duckworth, saying his comments were &quot;deeply offensive and racist.&quot; It was the first endorsement the HRC has ever withdrawn.

On November 8, 2016, Kirk lost to Duckworth by 15 points 55%-40%.

===Political positions===
Kirk is a moderate Republican. Kirk was sworn in on November 29, 2010, as the junior U.S. senator from Illinois. Kirk sat at the Senate&#x27;s coveted Candy Desk for several years. Kirk is considered to be a social moderate and fiscal conservative. On June 7, 2016, Kirk withdrew his initial support for businessman and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election due to his &quot;past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me.&quot; Kirk said he would write-in former CIA Director David Petraeus. Kirk was ranked as the 6th most bipartisan member of the U.S. Senate during the 114th United States Congress, and the fourth most bipartisan member of the U.S. Senate from the American Midwest (after Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, and Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

====Infrastructure and transportation policy====
In his first year in the Senate, Kirk worked along with U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D–IL) to help mediate a dispute between airlines serving O&#x27;Hare International Airport and the City of Chicago in order to keep the O&#x27;Hare modernization project on schedule. It is estimated the project would create 200,000 jobs and add $18 billion to the regional economy when completed.

Kirk and Durbin also worked together to bring $186 million in federal funds to support improved rail service from Chicago to St. Louis. The money was originally rejected by the state of Florida but reallocated to Illinois.

Kirk authored legislation, entitled the Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act, that sought to eliminate barriers and encourage private investment in roads, transit, airport and rail. Several of the provisions in the legislation would later become law under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112–114), including provisions to eliminate barriers to public-private partnerships for public transportation projects and a boost for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFA) program.

====Environmental policy====
Along with then-Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), Kirk co-chaired the Senate&#x27;s Great Lakes Task Force, and on June 26, 2013, the two introduced the Great Lakes Ecological and Economic Protection Act (GLEEPA). This legislation authorizes more funds to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in their efforts to restore wetlands, control invasive species, and regulate dumping of sewage and other industrial byproducts into the Great Lakes watershed. It also re-authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Great Lakes national Program Office and Great Lakes Legacy Act, which addresses dumping of toxic waste. Kirk had introduced similar legislation before, and Kirk had been a longstanding supporter of efforts to keep invasive Asian Carp out of the Great Lakes ecosystem.

Kirk accepts the scientific consensus on climate change.

==== Iran ====
In 2016, Kirk suggested that Iran should be required to provide reports about how funds made available through sanctions relief were used to ensure that money was not ending up in the hands of Hezbollah or the Iranian military.

==== Qatar ====
In May 2016, Kirk petitioned the Treasury Department to be more aggressive towards Qatar&#x27;s financing of terrorism.

====Illinois debt crisis====
Kirk appointed a sovereign debt advisory board to help research the unfunded obligations and unpaid bills contributing to Illinois&#x27; debt crisis. He later produced a Report on Illinois Debt highlighting the unsustainable debt the state continued to hold and the need for pension reform. Kirk introduced legislation entitled No State Bailouts, S. Res. 188, along with 14 other U.S. Senators, which would ban federal bailouts of financially struggling states. Illinois State Treasurer Dan Rutherford endorsed the legislation.

====Anti-corruption work====
Kirk and Representative Bob Dold (R–IL-10) (who succeeded him in his House seat) introduced bipartisan legislation to expand qualifications for ending federal pension payouts to elected officials convicted of corruption. The bicameral provision expanded current law to include an additional 22 crimes, and the bill was included in the STOCK Act signed by the President in April 2012.

====Social issues====
Kirk voted for re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.

Kirk is pro-choice. In 2015, he was one of two Republicans to oppose a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. Kirk opposes Republican Party efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. In September 2015, Kirk and Senator Durbin were thanked by the presidents of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Illinois Action for their opposition to such measures. He has a lifetime 75% grade from Planned Parenthood and an 80% rating in 2015 from NARAL Pro-Choice America, both organizations that support legal abortion access. Conversely, he had a 55% score from the pro-life Campaign for Working Families which opposes abortion. The pro-life group, Illinois Right to Life, gave Kirk a 0% rating.

In May 2010, Kirk voted against the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell. In December 2010, Kirk joined seven other Senate Republicans in voting in favor of the policy&#x27;s repeal. In 2015, he was one of 11 Senate Republicans who voted to offer social security benefits to same-sex couples living in states where same-sex marriage was not yet recognized.

On April 2, 2013, Kirk became the second sitting Republican U.S. Senator to support same-sex marriage, joining Ohio Senator Rob Portman. He was given a 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign, which supports same-sex marriage and LGBT rights, and a 100% score by PFLAG or Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.

Kirk is a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and in November 2013 became one of several Republicans to vote in favor of the law, which would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

In January 2016, Kirk became the first Republican U.S. Senator to co-sponsor the Equality Act, which would make sex, sexual orientation and gender identity among the prohibited categories of discrimination or segregation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

====Labor====
In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was supported by President Barack Obama and many Democratic Senators, but opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Kirk said he would not vote for the bill or a related compromise bill.

Kirk voted in April 2014 to extend federal funding for unemployment benefits. Federal funding had been initiated in 2008 and expired at the end of 2013.

In March 2015, Kirk voted for an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow employees to earn paid sick time.

====Gun policy====
Kirk is the only Republican U.S. Senator to receive an &quot;F&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. In 2015, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. He supports background checks for gun sales, and in 2013 was the only Republican senator to vote for an assault weapons ban.

====Other policy issues====
In 2011, Kirk was one of only two Republicans to oppose legislation to detain American citizens indefinitely.

In the aftermath of the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight by missiles over Ukraine in 2014, Kirk called for an investigation into the possibility of outfitting commercial airliners with missile defense systems.

In 2014, Kirk co-sponsored legislation to re-authorize the Export-Import Bank.

After the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, Kirk was the first Republican U.S. Senator to publicly state that President Barack Obama&#x27;s eventual replacement nominee for the Supreme Court should get a hearing and a vote. Other Republicans believed the next president should nominate a replacement for Scalia. In April 2016, Kirk met with Obama&#x27;s nominee, Merrick Garland, and circulated a memo to his Republican colleagues encouraging them to meet with him as well.

==Personal life==
In February 1998, Kirk met Kimberly Vertolli, a Naval Intelligence Officer, while the two were on duty together at the Pentagon. The two married in 2001 and divorced in 2009.

===Stroke and recovery===
On January 21, 2012, at age 52, Kirk suffered an ischemic stroke caused by a damaged blood vessel in his neck. Two days later, he underwent neurosurgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago; a piece of his cranium was temporarily removed to lessen any danger from the brain swelling process. He underwent follow-up surgery two days after that to remove more of his skull and some damaged brain tissue. He suffered significant left-sided weakness and spent several months at an inpatient physical rehabilitation center.

On May 1, 2012, Kirk was sent home from the rehabilitation center. A statement from his family said he would continue to work on rehabilitation on an outpatient basis, but that he had progressed enough to be able to move home with his family. A week later, Kirk&#x27;s staff released a video showing Kirk walking on a treadmill and down a hallway at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago as doctors worked with him to help fully regain the use of his left side. A second video was released in August, showing Kirk was living at his Fort Sheridan, Illinois home, and while his left side still showed impairment, Kirk was walking without aid. On November 4, he participated in a &quot;SkyRise Chicago&quot; challenge to climb the stairs of Willis Tower, successfully completing 37 floors.

On January 3, 2013, Kirk returned to the Capitol for the first time since his stroke in time for the start of the 113th Congress. He was escorted up the Capitol steps by Vice President and President of the Senate Joe Biden.

Kirk returned to his role as Senator, at times using a cane or wheelchair for assistance. He cites his public role as motivation to return to work and to serve as an example for families suffering from stroke and his stroke itself as motivation to improve early stroke detection and rehabilitation.

<text>In mathematics, the Hessian matrix, Hessian or (less commonly) Hesse matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, or scalar field. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. The Hessian matrix was developed in the 19th century by the German mathematician Ludwig Otto Hesse and later named after him. Hesse originally used the term &quot;functional determinants&quot;. The Hessian is sometimes denoted by H or, ambiguously, by ∇2.

== Definitions and properties ==

Suppose formula_1 is a function taking as input a vector formula_2 and outputting a scalar formula_3 If all second-order partial derivatives of formula_4 exist, then the Hessian matrix formula_5 of formula_4 is a square formula_7 matrix, usually defined and arranged as 
formula_8
That is, the entry of the th row and the th column is
formula_9

If furthermore the second partial derivatives are all continuous, the Hessian matrix is a symmetric matrix by the symmetry of second derivatives.

The determinant of the Hessian matrix is called the .

The Hessian matrix of a function formula_4 is the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of the gradient of the function formula_4; that is: formula_12

== Applications ==

=== Inflection points ===

If formula_4 is a homogeneous polynomial in three variables, the equation formula_14 is the implicit equation of a plane projective curve. The inflection points of the curve are exactly the non-singular points where the Hessian determinant is zero. It follows by Bézout&#x27;s theorem that a cubic plane curve has at most 9 inflection points, since the Hessian determinant is a polynomial of degree 3.

=== Second-derivative test ===
The Hessian matrix of a convex function is positive semi-definite. Refining this property allows us to test whether a critical point formula_15 is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point, as follows:

If the Hessian is positive-definite at formula_16 then formula_4 attains an isolated local minimum at formula_18 If the Hessian is negative-definite at formula_16 then formula_4 attains an isolated local maximum at formula_18 If the Hessian has both positive and negative eigenvalues, then formula_15 is a saddle point for formula_23 Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that at a local minimum the Hessian is positive-semidefinite, and at a local maximum the Hessian is negative-semidefinite.

For positive-semidefinite and negative-semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of Morse theory.

The second-derivative test for functions of one and two variables is simpler than the general case. In one variable, the Hessian contains exactly one second derivative; if it is positive, then formula_15 is a local minimum, and if it is negative, then formula_15 is a local maximum; if it is zero, then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the determinant can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive, then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative, then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.

Equivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) minors (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization—the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign, with the formula_26 minor being negative.

=== Critical points ===

If the gradient (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function formula_4 is zero at some point formula_28 then formula_4 has a (or ) at formula_30 The determinant of the Hessian at formula_31 is called, in some contexts, a discriminant. If this determinant is zero then formula_31 is called a of formula_33 or a of formula_23 Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a of formula_23

The Hessian matrix plays an important role in Morse theory and catastrophe theory, because its kernel and eigenvalues allow classification of the critical points.

The determinant of the Hessian matrix, when evaluated at a critical point of a function, is equal to the Gaussian curvature of the function considered as a manifold. The eigenvalues of the Hessian at that point are the principal curvatures of the function, and the eigenvectors are the principal directions of curvature. (See .)

=== Use in optimization ===

Hessian matrices are used in large-scale optimization problems within Newton-type methods because they are the coefficient of the quadratic term of a local Taylor expansion of a function. That is,
formula_36
where formula_37 is the gradient formula_38 Computing and storing the full Hessian matrix takes formula_39 memory, which is infeasible for high-dimensional functions such as the loss functions of neural nets, conditional random fields, and other statistical models with large numbers of parameters. For such situations, truncated-Newton and quasi-Newton algorithms have been developed. The latter family of algorithms use approximations to the Hessian; one of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is BFGS.

Such approximations may use the fact that an optimization algorithm uses the Hessian only as a linear operator formula_40 and proceed by first noticing that the Hessian also appears in the local expansion of the gradient:
formula_41

Letting formula_42 for some scalar formula_43 this gives
formula_44
that is,
formula_45
so if the gradient is already computed, the approximate Hessian can be computed by a linear (in the size of the gradient) number of scalar operations. (While simple to program, this approximation scheme is not numerically stable since formula_46 has to be made small to prevent error due to the formula_47 term, but decreasing it loses precision in the first term.)

Notably regarding Randomized Search Heuristics, the evolution strategy&#x27;s covariance matrix adapts to the inverse of the Hessian matrix, up to a scalar factor and small random fluctuations.
This result has been formally proven for a single-parent strategy and a static model, as the population size increases, relying on the quadratic approximation.

The Hessian matrix is commonly used for expressing image processing operators in image processing and computer vision (see the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) blob detector, the determinant of Hessian (DoH) blob detector and scale space). It can be used in normal mode analysis to calculate the different molecular frequencies in infrared spectroscopy. It can also be used in local sensitivity and statistical diagnostics.

== Generalizations ==

=== Bordered Hessian ===

A is used for the second-derivative test in certain constrained optimization problems. Given the function formula_4 considered previously, but adding a constraint function formula_49 such that formula_50 the bordered Hessian is the Hessian of the Lagrange function formula_51:
formula_52

If there are, say, formula_53 constraints then the zero in the upper-left corner is an formula_54 block of zeros, and there are formula_53 border rows at the top and formula_53 border columns at the left.

The above rules stating that extrema are characterized (among critical points with a non-singular Hessian) by a positive-definite or negative-definite Hessian cannot apply here since a bordered Hessian can neither be negative-definite nor positive-definite, as formula_57 if formula_58 is any vector whose sole non-zero entry is its first.

The second derivative test consists here of sign restrictions of the determinants of a certain set of formula_59 submatrices of the bordered Hessian. Intuitively, the formula_53 constraints can be thought of as reducing the problem to one with formula_59 free variables. (For example, the maximization of formula_62 subject to the constraint formula_63 can be reduced to the maximization of formula_64 without constraint.)

Specifically, sign conditions are imposed on the sequence of leading principal minors (determinants of upper-left-justified sub-matrices) of the bordered Hessian, for which the first formula_65 leading principal minors are neglected, the smallest minor consisting of the truncated first formula_66 rows and columns, the next consisting of the truncated first formula_67 rows and columns, and so on, with the last being the entire bordered Hessian; if formula_66 is larger than formula_69 then the smallest leading principal minor is the Hessian itself. There are thus formula_59 minors to consider, each evaluated at the specific point being considered as a candidate maximum or minimum. A sufficient condition for a local is that these minors alternate in sign with the smallest one having the sign of formula_71 A sufficient condition for a local is that all of these minors have the sign of formula_72 (In the unconstrained case of formula_73 these conditions coincide with the conditions for the unbordered Hessian to be negative definite or positive definite respectively).

=== Vector-valued functions ===

If formula_4 is instead a vector field formula_75 that is,
formula_76
then the collection of second partial derivatives is not a formula_7 matrix, but rather a third-order tensor. This can be thought of as an array of formula_53 Hessian matrices, one for each component of formula_79:
formula_80
This tensor degenerates to the usual Hessian matrix when formula_81

=== Generalization to the complex case ===

In the context of several complex variables, the Hessian may be generalized. Suppose formula_82 and write formula_83 Identifying formula_84 with formula_85, the normal &quot;real&quot; Hessian is a formula_86 matrix. As the object of study in several complex variables are holomorphic functions, that is, solutions to the n-dimensional Cauchy–Riemann conditions, we usually look on the part of the Hessian that contains information invariant under holomorphic changes of coordinates. This &quot;part&quot; is the so-called complex Hessian, which is the matrix formula_87 Note that if formula_4 is holomorphic, then its complex Hessian matrix is identically zero, so the complex Hessian is used to study smooth but not holomorphic functions, see for example Levi pseudoconvexity. When dealing with holomorphic functions, we could consider the Hessian matrix formula_89

=== Generalizations to Riemannian manifolds ===

Let formula_90 be a Riemannian manifold and formula_91 its Levi-Civita connection. Let formula_92 be a smooth function. Define the Hessian tensor by
formula_93
where this takes advantage of the fact that the first covariant derivative of a function is the same as its ordinary differential. Choosing local coordinates formula_94 gives a local expression for the Hessian as
formula_95
where formula_96 are the Christoffel symbols of the connection. Other equivalent forms for the Hessian are given by
formula_97

<doc id="412110" wikidata="Q740636" url="?curid=412110" title="Jerry Weller">
<text>Gerald Cameron Weller (born July 7, 1957) is an American politician who was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing . As of 2015, Weller is the managing principal of New World Group Public Affairs, a lobbying group with offices in Washington, DC, Florida and Guatemala. He was also a Global Development Officer for an IPTV company called VIPTV.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Weller was born in Streator, Illinois, to LaVern and Marilyn Weller, and raised on his family&#x27;s hog farm in Dwight, Illinois. Weller is a 1979 graduate of the University of Illinois where he received his degree in agriculture. Weller has been married twice.

Weller was a staff member for U.S. Congressman Tom Corcoran from 1980 to 1981, assistant to the director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and an aide to Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block from 1981 to 1985.

In the 1986 general election, Weller challenged incumbent Democratic Representative Ray A. Christensen in the 85th district. In the official result, Weller won by a four-vote margin, 14,217 to 14,213. Christensen challenged the result while Weller was sworn in as the State Representative. The Illinois House of Representatives set up a House Committee on Election Contests which heard the two candidates&#x27; challenges. In a party line vote, the House voted to unseat Weller and seat Christensen.

In the 1988 election, Weller was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives defeating Democratic candidate and Grundy County Clerk Lana Phillips after Christensen opted to retire. Weller was succeeded by Grundy County Board member Stephen Spangler.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Weller was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 following the retirement of Democrat George Sangmeister. Weller won a crowded Republican primary, and defeated fellow State Representative Frank Giglio in the general election.

In 1995, Weller received an Environmental Protector Award from the Chicago Audubon Society for his political service. After a release of tritium from Exelon&#x27;s Braidwood and Dresden Nuclear Power Plant Weller sent a letter to Exelon Corp expressing his concern and recommended that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigate the power plants in question.

In 2002, a Federal Election Commission audit found a fund used by Weller for his re-election in 2000 received almost $11,000 that appeared to have violated federal campaign rules on the size and source of donations. Weller&#x27;s fund returned all of the questioned contributions but did not admit deliberately violating any laws.

On October 10, 2002, Weller voted with the 296-133 majority in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

Weller served as Deputy Minority Whip. On September 21, 2007, Weller announced that he would not seek another term, citing the need to spend more time with his family.

Weller supported free trade when serving in Congress and traveled throughout Latin America and the Caribbean to build better relationships with public sector and business leaders. He was the number one supporter for the Panama trade agreement with the United States.

Weller made efforts to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. He supported the use of tax incentives to help redevelop brownfield formal industrial land, developing a proposal with Democrats, such as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, to do so.

Weller championed the creation of the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie and other redevelopment efforts at the former Joliet arsenal. Redevelopment of the site included the Deer Run Industrial Park, which contains the CenterPoint Intermodal Center, a new intermodal freight transport center.

Weller supported plans for the Illiana Expressway.

Weller voted again to raise the minimum wage in the 110th Congress.

Weller sponsored a bill to expand concurrent receipt for wounded military veterans, but it did not pass.

Weller sponsored a bill to make the residential energy efficient property credit permanent, which never left committee.

Weller promised prior to his marriage to Guatemalan Congresswoman Zury Mayté Ríos Sosa de Weller, that he would not vote on any legislation involving solely the U.S. and Guatemala. His advocacy and vote for CAFTA caused controversy however, despite it being a multi-nation agreement. Weller has long supported free-trade agreements. As a FRG party leader, his wife was also a supporter of CAFTA.

Weller accepted money from two convicted associates of former congressman Duke Cunningham. Weller&#x27;s spokesman said that the donations probably originated from his support of the research and development tax credit and the money was donated to a charity in Oregon. Weller and 11 other congressmen were subpoenaed to testify in the trial of Brent R. Wilkes, the contractor accused of bribing Cunningham. The subpoenas were withdrawn by defense attorneys on October 3, 2007 when it became apparent the trial judge would quash them anyway. Weller and the other 11 did not testify in the trial.

Weller was the only member of the House of Representatives to abstain in the vote for the proposed bailout of U.S. financial system (2008).

===Committees===
Weller was on the following committees at various times:
* Committee on Ways &amp; Means (-2008)
** Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support (Ranking Member) (-2008)
** Subcommittee on Trade
* Committee On International Relations (-2006)

==Personal life==
In July 2004, Weller announced that he was engaged to three-term Guatemalan Congresswoman Zury Mayté Ríos Sosa, daughter of former Guatemalan dictator Efraín Ríos Montt. On November 20, 2004, the two married at her father&#x27;s home in Antigua Guatemala; this was his second marriage and her fourth. (Zury Ríos has also used the combined parental surname, Ríos Sosa, following the naming customs of Hispanic America; during this marriage, her personal website used the hybrid married form &quot;Ríos-Montt de Weller&quot;.)

In August 2006, a daughter, Marizú Catherine, was born in a hospital in Guatemala City.

Weller and Ríos have since divorced.

===Properties in Nicaragua===
On October 25, 2006, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; reported that Weller had disclosed three parcels of land he owned in Nicaragua on his financial disclosure forms: one purchased in 2002, one purchased in April 2004, and one purchased in December 2005. The newspaper also reported that it had obtained notarized bills of sale for three more lots owned by Weller that had never been listed on his forms: a lot sold in February 2005, a lot purchased in March 2005, and lot purchased in April 2005. The failure to properly disclosure property ownership was alleged to be a violation of the Ethics in Government Act and the False Statements Accountability Act of 1996.

Weller&#x27;s lawyer said that he couldn&#x27;t comment because of the attorney-client privilege. Weller&#x27;s campaign manager said Weller &quot;does not own three more parcels in Nicaragua. He does not own six parcels in Nicaragua. He has filed his disclosure for everything that he owns.&quot;

On September 7, 2007, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; disclosed the results of their own investigation into his land deals, including discrepancies on declared prices and numbers of transactions, centered in the Playa Coco resort area. For example, Weller listed only one Nicaraguan property purchase on his 2005 disclosure form, but property records in Nicaragua showed that he bought or sold at least eight pieces of land. No inquiry was ever launched by the Democratically-controlled House, but Weller announced that he would not seek reelection on September 21, 2007.

<text>Lloyd Honeyghan (born 22 April 1960) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1980 to 1995. He reigned as the undisputed welterweight champion from 1986 to 1987, and held the WBC, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine welterweight titles twice between 1986 and 1989. At regional level he held the British, European and Commonwealth welterweight titles between 1983 and 1985, and the Commonwealth super-welterweight title from 1993 to 1994.

==Early life and amateur career==
Honeyghan was born in Jamaica and spent his early years there living with his grandparents. He came to England at the age of nine to join his parents who had settled in Bermondsey. He took up boxing at the age of 11 with the Fisher Amateur Boxing club. He was a good, rather than an outstanding amateur boxer. He boxed for England but never won an ABA title, being beaten in the English semi-finals by Joey Frost in 1979. In the 1980 ABA championships he was beaten early in the competition on points by Gunther Roomes, at the South East Division of the London championships and decided to turn professional.

==Professional career==
Honeyghan turned professional with Terry Lawless in 1980. He debuted with a six-round points decision victory over fellow novice Mike Sullivan. He won his first 13 fights, including a victory over the tough Kostas Petrou. Before positioning himself for an eliminator against the capable Lloyd Hibbert for the British welterweight title on 18 January 1983. Honeyghan outpointed the future British super-welterweight champion over ten rounds. He followed this by capturing the Southern Area welterweight title with a fourth-round knockout over the dangerous Sid Smith in March 1983.

===British welterweight champion===
Honeyghan captured the British welterweight title via a twelve-round points decision against the tough Cliff Gilpin on 5 April 1983, after suffering the first knockdown of his career in the second round. Honeyghan later stated that Gilpin gave him one of his hardest fights.

He remained busy throughout 1983, travelling to the United States to defeat Kevin Austin, then outpointing US contender Harold Brazier in London before rounding off the year with a clear points victory in a British title rematch with Cliff Gilpin.

In 1984 Honeyghan fought only once, defeating Roberto Mendez. He suffered a broken thumb and had to have a pin inserted into his left hand to keep the bone in place.

===European welterweight champion===
On 5 January 1985 he captured the European welterweight title with a highly impressive third-round knockout of future two-time super-welterweight world champion Gianfranco Rosi in Perugia, Italy. In sparring preparing for the contest Honeyghan had been knocked out by former ABA champion David Dent, who was not known as a puncher. However, it didn&#x27;t affect his performance as he achieved the rare feat of a foreign fighter obtaining a victory in Italy. Following this, Honeyghan defeated R W Smith (better known as Robert Smith) who is the current General Secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control in six rounds. He kept extremely busy during 1985, defeating three US contenders in world title challenger Roger Stafford, followed by Danny Paul and Ralph Twinning.

Honeyghan and Lawless parted company because Honeyghan believed that Lawless was spending too much time on the career of Frank Bruno and not enough on his career. As such the two couldn&#x27;t get on and things came to a head following an altercation between Honeyghan and his trainer Jimmy Tibbs, in the Royal Oak gym run by Lawless. An argument between the two ended up with bystanders having to drag them apart. Following the incident, Lawless banned Honeyghan from his gym; Honeyghan promptly signed with Mickey Duff.

Honeyghan appointed former British featherweight champion Bobby Neill as his new trainer and closed out 1985 with a stoppage victory over fellow world rated Briton and former stablemate Sylvester Mittee, for the British, European, and Commonwealth welterweight titles.

On 20 May 1986 Honeyghan stopped top US contender Horace Shufford in eight rounds in London, earning him a title shot against the unbeaten and undisputed welterweight world champion Donald Curry of the US.

===Undisputed welterweight champion===
On 27 September 1986, Honeyghan defeated Curry for the undisputed welterweight title. The fight took place in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and was televised by Showtime.

At the time Curry was considered to be one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world with his only possible rival being Marvin Hagler. Honeyghan was given little chance by the majority of the media. However, there were rumours that Curry was having difficulty making the welterweight limit and that this would be his last fight at the weight. 

The betting odds prior to the fight were 7.5–1 against Honeyghan. His manager Duff placed a bet of $5,000 on Honeyghan to win. When he told Honeyghan what he had done he said that they could split it down the middle. Duff refused and told him to place his own bets. Honeyghan asked Duff to place a bet of $5,000 on his behalf but when he went back to place the bet the odds had reduced to 6-1 and Duff placed the bet. When he told Honeyghan about the reduced odds he said they could split the difference and again Duff refused.

He caused a major upset by dominating the fight, nearly dropping Curry in the second round, before Curry retired at the end of round six. Curry suffered a broken nose along with cuts to his lip and above his eye, which required 20 stitches. As a result of his bet Honeyghan earned an additional $30,000 and Duff relented and split the difference paying him an additional $3,750 because he was the one who had won the fight..

At the press conference before the fight Curry had dismissed his little known and lightly taken British opponent, asking &quot;Who is this ragamuffin?&quot; Because Honeyghan had come to the press conference in casual clothes. Honeyghan thereafter adopted the title &#x27;Raggamuffin&#x27; with relish. Embracing his Jamaican heritage where a raggamuffin is a streetwise tough guy. Prior to this his ring moniker had been Lloyd &#x27;Honey&#x27; Honeyghan.

The fight had taken place one night after another &quot;expert shocker&quot;, when Edwin Rosario knocked out Livingstone Bramble in two rounds to claim the WBA lightweight title, and one week after Honeyghan&#x27;s win, &quot;Ring&quot; magazine mentioned his victory on their &quot;Weekend of shockers!&quot; issue&#x27;s cover. (Rosario&#x27;s photo was featured on the cover of that issue).

===WBA title vacated===
Honeyghan disagreed with the WBA&#x27;s rules that allowed fights to take place in apartheid South Africa, so he publicly and controversially dumped the WBA welterweight title into a London trash bin soon after winning it, relinquishing the title rather than defending it against South African Harold Volbrecht. Honeyghan was criticised for showing a lack of respect after dropping the belt in the trash can, especially as Deuk Koo Kim had lost his life in 1982 when fighting Ray Mancini for the WBA Lightweight title. Honeyghan did admit to regretting his actions, which had resulted after he had been prompted to do so by tabloid newspaper photographers. His stance proved significant, as soon after, the WBA stopped sanctioning fights held in South Africa.

===Continued title defences===
After winning the world title he changed his boxer-puncher style to that of more of a brawler. He became known for his full frontal assault on opponents. Most boxers would spend the early rounds boxing cautiously until they had figured out their opponent&#x27;s style of fighting. Honeyghan went for a knockout from the opening bell. Asked why he had changed his fighting style Honeyghan quipped &quot;You don&#x27;t get paid for overtime in this business.&quot;

In his first defence, after dominating and flooring his opponent in the first round. He caused controversy by (legally at that time) racing across the ring and trying to hit his opponent, former super-lightweight world champion Johnny Bumphus, as soon as the bell sounded to start the second round. Honeyghan threw a left hook which missed but the momentum from his forearm knocked an unsteady Bumphus to the canvas. Honeyghan had a point deducted from his score and Bumphus was given time to recover. However, the fight had already been knocked out of him and he did not last much longer. Asked why he had done this, Honeyghan stated &quot;The bell went ding and I went dong.&quot; The rules were changed following this incident so that at the beginning of each round the referee stands in the middle of the ring. Instead of in a neutral corner, as it had previously been, to prevent punches being thrown until both fighters are ready.

In his second defence of the title, Honeyghan defeated the then unbeaten future world champion Maurice Blocker on points. He became a crowd pleaser with his all action style of fighting and recorded one of the fastest wins in a world title fight with a 45 second blowout of former Super-lightweight champion Gene Hatcher of the US. His manager Duff said after the fight &quot;The best fighter I have been involved with was John Conteh, even though he never reached his full potential. Lloyd is catching him up fast. I&#x27;ve never known a more dedicated fighter.&quot;

===Losing the titles===

He controversially lost his WBC title to Jorge Vaca in 1987 when a clash of heads meant that the fight had to be stopped due to a cut sustained by Vaca. Vaca had come in as a late replacement for Bobby Joe Young who had been deemed an unacceptable opponent by the British Boxing Board of Control. Honeyghan was expected to win the fight as Vaca was a relatively unknown fighter. However, an off form Honeyghan was given plenty of trouble by the heavy-handed Mexican. The WBC implemented their technical decision rule (which has now been withdrawn) and Honeyghan had a point deducted from his score, even though the clash of heads had been deemed accidental and the round had not been completed. Without the point deduction the fight would have been a draw meaning that Honeyghan would have retained his title. After the point deduction the scorecards favoured Vaca and he became the new champion. The fight was not for the IBF title which was declared vacant and was subsequently won by Simon Brown. Many fans said that Vaca had been given the decision because the WBC who are based in Mexico were holding their convention in London during the week of the fight.

Honeyghan became only the second British boxer in history to regain a world title, when he knocked Vaca out with an uppercut to the Solar plexus in a return fight for the WBC title in the third round. The first being Ted &quot;Kid&quot; Lewis earlier in the 20th century. In the post-fight press conference Honeyghan, who could at times be an outspoken character, expressed his views on Mickey Duff, stating &quot;Mickey and I don&#x27;t mix outside of boxing, he looks at me as a pawn, a commodity. I don&#x27;t like him.&quot; This elicited a memorable response from Duff who stated &quot;There is nothing in our contract that says we have to like each other I will continue to do the best job I can for him.&quot;

Honeyghan had appointed Duff as both his manager and promoter.The job of the manager is to arrange the best matches and obtain the most money for the boxer. The job of the promoter is to negotiate with boxing managers to obtain the services of their boxers for the lowest amount possible to ensure the promotion makes a profit. As such, when Duff was promoting a show featuring Honeyghan he was actually negotiating with himself as to how much money Honeyghan would be paid. There was a clear conflict of interest and Honeyghan believed that Duff wasn&#x27;t paying him the kind of money he thought his services warranted. Duff once called Honeyghan an ingrate because without his connections and promotional skills Honeyghan would never have become the number one contender and obtained the fight with Curry.

At that time Duff was the main boxing promoter in the UK through his company National Promotions in conjunction with Jarvis Astaire. Frank Warren and Barry Hearn were only just emerging on the scene and as a British fighter, if you wanted to fight for a world title you had to work with Duff, who had high level contacts in the world of boxing. 

Professional boxers are classified as being self-employed and under the standard British Boxing Board of Control Boxer/Manager Agreement the manager is paid 25% of the amount the boxer earns. As such Duff was being paid 25% of Honeyghan&#x27;s earnings from boxing plus any profit he made from the boxing shows that he promoted featuring Honeyghan. The argument that was used by Duff was that once he agreed to pay a specific amount to a fighter, he would have to pay that amount whether the promotion made money or not. As such he could find himself out of pocket if the promotion lost money. Duff had a reputation for treating fighters as if he was their employer and they were the employee. Honeyghan who was known for being headstrong thought to himself &quot;I am the champion and no one tells me what to do&quot; that was part of the reason why he resented Duff. 

Honeyghan next defended against tough South Korean Yung-Kil Chung, halting him in five rounds in July 1988 when the Korean refused to get up after being hit with an accidental low blow. 

In February 1989 Honeyghan lost his WBC title to former Don Curry victim and arch-rival Marlon Starling. There was bad blood between the two fighters and Honeyghan boxed wildly against the defensively excellent Starling. He was stopped in the ninth round after taking heavy punishment throughout the fight. Years before the two fought Starling came out with a classic foot in mouth boxing quote when he said &quot;I&#x27;ll fight Lloyd Honeyghan for nothing if the price is right.&quot; Honeyghan returned later in the year, labouring to a points decision over Delfino Marin in Florida, however he appeared to be a fading force.

He had to apologise to the WBA for his previous actions in order to fight for the WBA title in 1990 against Mark Breland. By this time Honeyghan was past his best and was stopped by Breland in three rounds after being knocked down six times.

===Later career at super-welterweight===
In 1991, he resumed his career at super-welterweight having outgrown the welterweight division. During 1991 and 1992 he won six consecutive fights against relatively modest opposition in Mario Olmedo, John Welters, Darryl Anthony, Alfredo Ramirez, Mickey Duncan and Carlo Colarusso. In early 1993 he was still good enough to win the Commonwealth super-welterweight title by defeating the useful Mickey Hughes. However, in June of that year he was stopped in ten rounds by former world champion Vinny Pazienza in a contest made at middleweight. Victories over Steve Goodwin and in 1994 Kevin Adamson followed, with Honeyghan retaining the Commonwealth title in the latter fight. He did not fight for another year and retired after he was stopped in a bout by fellow Briton Adrian Dodson in three rounds in 1995, on the undercard of Nigel Benn vs. Gerald McClellan.

==Doping allegations==
Lloyd Honeyghan always had trouble with his hands and tested positive for a painkilling drug after his fight against Marlon Starling. He was fined $1,500 by the Nevada Athletic Commission.

==Personal life==
On leaving school Honeyghan became an apprentice printer working at Fleet Street where the national newspapers were printed. He continued in this trade until he became a full time professional boxer.

In his younger days Honeyghan developed a reputation for being a flashy dresser and a ladies&#x27; man. The tabloid newspapers had a field-day when he became a world champion and revealed that he had fathered five children with three different women, none of whom he had married.

He was attacked and hit on the head with a hammer at a weigh-in at the Thomas A&#x27; Beckett gym in 1993. A fellow boxer, Darren Dyer, was arrested and charged with causing actual bodily harm after the attack but was acquitted in the subsequent trial. Honeyghan said that he was signing an autograph for a fan, when Dyer approached him and swung a carrier bag containing the hammer at him. The bag hit him on the forehead and although stunned, he managed to remain on his feet. He said that Dyer was so enraged prior to the attack that he looked like E.T., Dyer&#x27;s defence was that they had a fist fight and he got the better of it. 

There had been bad blood between the two stemming from the Curry fight, when Dyer who was also managed by Duff had been one of Honeyghan&#x27;s sparring partners. The trouble between them started when Dyer was talking on the telephone in his hotel room to one of his relatives in England. The relative asked him how he thought Honeyghan would get on against Curry. Dyer stated that he didn&#x27;t think that Honeyghan stood a chance and that Curry would knock him out. Unbeknown to him Honeyghan was in the hotel room next to his and heard everything that he said. Honeyghan took offence to his comments and confronted him about them.

Dyer felt that Honeyghan had taken liberties with him in sparring as a means of getting his revenge for the comments. Bearing in mind that despite being a former ABA champion and Commonwealth games gold medal winner, Dyer at the time was still to make his professional debut. There had been an altercation between him and Dyer in the changing rooms following his win over Mickey Hughes for the Commonwealth title. Dennie Mancini had prevented Dyer from hitting Honeyghan on the head with the trophy he had just been presented with, as a result of winning the fight.

When Frank Bruno fought Oliver McCall for the WBC World heavyweight title in September 1995. Honeyghan entered the ring as a member of McCall&#x27;s camp, despite the fact that he and Bruno had been friends in the past, when they had both been part of the Terry Lawless stable of fighters. He received a lot of criticism from British boxing fans as a result of his actions.

Honeyghan and Mike Tyson are friends and when Tyson came to England he acted as his guide. They had first met at the Curry fight where Tyson had been ringside and had been impressed by Honeyghan&#x27;s performance. He stated &quot;He&#x27;s mean and nasty, he doesn&#x27;t fight like a British fighter.&quot; Stated in reference to his less than imperious reputation both in and out of the ring; in contrast with the gentlemanly reputation of British boxers in America at the time. 

In 2014 Bruno had to step in to stop Honeyghan and Errol Christie from squaring up to each other at the Boxing Writers’ Club’s 63rd annual dinner at London’s Savoy Hotel. This came as a shock to many observers as the two had once been close friends. Christie stated “There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don’t know what planet he was on but it’s different to the rest of us. No punches were thrown, he was just mouthing off and acting the big shot. He even had a go at Frank.” 

He had a block of flats named after him in Southwark to mark his achievements.

Honeyghan put on a lot of weight in retirement and in October 2017, it was reported that he had suffered a heart attack but was making a good recovery in hospital. It was reported in September 2020 that Honeyghan had suffered a blood clot on his lung (Pulmonary embolism) and was again being treated in hospital. As a result of a car accident, Honeyghan can no longer walk and has to use a wheelchair.

==Business dealings==
Towards the end of his boxing career Honeyghan got involved in the music business. He produced two CDs featuring various reggae artists.

In common with a lot of former boxing champions Honeyghan found himself in financial difficulties towards the end of his career and was forced to fight on beyond the point where he should have retired. At one stage he had owned a Rolls-Royce and several properties. However, he was declared bankrupt in 1994 and automatically discharged from bankruptcy in 1997.

Following his retirement, he tried his hand as a boxing manager and promoter. He promoted a few boxing shows in South London. However, without the backing of a television company it was difficult for him to make money and he eventually relinquished his promoter&#x27;s licence.

<doc id="412114" wikidata="Q650893" url="?curid=412114" title="Jerry Costello">
<text>Jerry Francis Costello (born September 25, 1949) is an American politician and former U.S. Representative for . He previously represented and served in the US House from 1988 to 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was the dean of Illinois&#x27;s 21-member congressional delegation. In October 2011, Costello announced that he would not seek another term in Congress in 2012. He was succeeded by William Enyart.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Costello was born in East St. Louis, Illinois and attended Catholic schools, graduating from Assumption High School. He was later educated at Maryville College of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis, from which he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Costello worked in the law enforcement field. He served St. Clair County, Illinois as a court bailiff, deputy sheriff, and director of court services and probation. Costello later was chief investigator for the Illinois State Attorney’s office. In 1980, he was elected as chair of the St. Clair County Board. Costello served in this capacity as county executive until his election to the House.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Costello took office on in August 1988, after winning a special election with 51% of the vote, to fill the seat of the deceased Melvin Price. He was elected to a full term that November with 53% of the vote. After that, he received at least 60% of the vote in all of his re-election bids, until his retirement in 2012.

Costello was the most senior member of Illinois&#x27; House delegation during his final term in office. On October 4, 2011, he announced he would not seek reelection in 2012. Costello was succeeded by William Enyart, who was elected on November 6, 2012.

===Tenure===
Costello served on the National Leadership Committee of then-Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s National Catholic Advisory Council during his 2008 election campaign.

Shortly after the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States, Costello was prominently mentioned as a possible cabinet choice for Secretary of Transportation; the nomination eventually went to fellow Illinois Representative Ray LaHood. 

In 2011, Costello co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would strictly limit the situations in which abortion could be paid for by public funds. Costello is a member of the Reformers Caucus of Issue One.

;1997 ethics complaint
In 1996, federal prosecutors alleged that Costello was an unindicted co-conspirator in a plan to build a riverboat casino. At the end of an investigation and trial, a longtime friend of Costello&#x27;s was sentenced to six years in prison for obstruction of justice. Costello testified before a grand jury in regard to the matter, but was not indicted or charged in the case. He denied any involvement. In 1997, the Congressional Accountability Project filed an ethics complaint requesting investigation of Costello which resulted in no action.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Science, Space and Technology
**Subcommittee on Energy and Environment
*Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
**Subcommittee on Aviation (Ranking member)
**Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
**Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment

<text>Frederick Percival Mills (26 June 1919 – 25 July 1965) was an English boxer, and the world light heavyweight champion from 1948 to 1950. Mills was tall and did not have a sophisticated boxing style; he relied on two-fisted aggression, relentless pressure, and the ability to take punishment to carry him through, and in more cases than not these attributes were sufficient.

Mills excelled first as a middleweight, and most successfully as a light-heavyweight boxer, but also fought as a heavyweight. He was described as Britain&#x27;s biggest boxing idol in the post-war period and remained a popular media personality after his retirement from the ring.

Once he had retired from boxing, Mills moved into boxing management and promotion, and pursued a career in entertainment, working in radio, television (notably as co-presenter of the early BBC TV music show, &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; between 1957 and 1958), and on the stage, as well as playing roles in a number of films between 1952 and 1965. He opened a Chinese restaurant in Soho before there was an established Chinatown in the area and also ran his own London nightclub until his mysterious death.

== Early life ==
He was born Frederick Percival Mills in Bournemouth, Hampshire, the youngest of the four children of Thomas James Mills, a totter and marine store dealer, and his wife Lottie Hilda Gray. He received a pair of boxing gloves when he was eleven, and he used to spar with his brother Charlie. He attended St Michael&#x27;s School in Bournemouth until the age of fourteen, and then became an apprentice gardener and later a milkman&#x27;s assistant. The milkman in question was Percy Cook, brother of former Welsh lightweight champion Gordon Cook, and Percy helped Mills develop his boxing skills.

== Professional career ==

===Early career===
Mills had three bouts in 1936 in a 11 stone novices’ competition, all of which he won by knockout. He subsequently signed professional terms with manager Bob Turner. He began fighting in fairground booths and at venues on the south coast. His first 64 fights, in 3½ years, most fighting as a middleweight, though often against heavier opponents, resulted in 48 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws. By late 1939 he was the Western Area middleweight champion, and in April 1940 he beat Eastern Area champion Ginger Sadd on points. At the time, Mills was ranked 9th best middleweight in Britain, and Sadd 2nd.

In January 1940 he joined the Royal Air Force and went on to become first a corporal physical training instructor and, by the following year, a sergeant, while continuing to box professionally. He fought Jock McAvoy, the British and Commonwealth middleweight champion, the fight made at 12st 9lbs, McAvoy having the previous year unsuccessfully fought Len Harvey for the British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight titles. The fight against McAvoy took place in Liverpool in August 1940 and Mills won a clear decision over ten rounds. Mills subsequent fought mainly at light heavyweight.

In 1941 he was taken on by new manager Ted Broadribb, and began an affair with Broadribb&#x27;s daughter Chrissie, who was at the time married to South African boxer Don McCorkindale. In September 1941 he was disqualified for a low blow in the third round against Jack Hyams, suffering his first defeat in almost two years.

In November 1941 he stopped heavyweight Jim Wilde in the third round, despite conceding almost two and a half stones to the Welshman. In December 1941, he fought Jack London, a heavyweight who later (in 1944) won the British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles, Mills won on points over ten rounds despite conceding over three stones in weight to London. At this time Mills was nicknamed &#x27;The Bournemouth Bombshell&#x27;.

===British light-heavyweight title===
Mills was due to fight McAvoy in January 1942 in a final eliminator for the British and Empire (later &#x27;Commonwealth&#x27;) light-heavyweight title, but withdrew from the fight, stating that wanted to concentrate on fighting at heavyweight and challenge for Len Harvey&#x27;s title. He beat Tom Reddington at heavyweight later that month, but evidently had a change of heart, and in February 1942 fought McAvoy in a final eliminator for the light-heavyweight titles. The fight, in the Royal Albert Hall, ended after one round when McAvoy was forced to retire with an injured back. The way was open for Mills to challenge Len Harvey for the British and Empire light-heavyweight titles (Harvey at the time also holding the British heavyweight title).

The title fight took place on 20 June 1942, at White Hart Lane, Tottenham, in front of a crowd of 30,000. In the second round Mills caught Harvey with a powerful left hook and put him down for a count of nine. When Harvey got up Mills hit him with a left uppercut, knocking him through the ropes and off the ring canvas, and in doing so he won via a knockout. The fight created a sensation and Mills was talked of as a future challenger for Joe Louis. Mills now had the light-heavyweight titles. Harvey had also been considered world champion by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), but Mills decided not to accept the title, instead wishing to fight for American Gus Lesnevich&#x27;s more recognised world title. Mills only fought competitively four times in the next two years, all of them wins inside the distance, although he fought several exhibition fights, including several bouts with McCorkindale. Difficulty in making fights led him to consider relinquishing his titles in 1943, expressing a desire to switch to all-in wrestling.

Len Harvey&#x27;s retirement in early 1943 left the British and Empire heavyweight titles vacant. Mills and London were nominated to fight for the titles by the BBBofC in April that year, but after the fight was postponed three times, twice due to injuries sustained by London, they eventually met in September 1944. The fight took place at the Kings Hall, Belle Vue, Manchester, with Mills conceding just over three stone (19 kilos) in weight. Both men were at the time serving in the Royal Air Force. Mills showed speed and aggression, but London&#x27;s superior strength and power were evident in the closing stages and the heavier man was awarded the decision after fifteen rounds.

Mills and London were set to fight again in February 1945, but London&#x27;s RAF duties made it impossible for him to train. Instead, Mills fought former Scottish amateur heavyweight champion Ken Shaw, stopping him in the seventh round.

===World title fight===
In March 1945, Mills was posted to India and Burma as part of a touring party that also included Denis Compton, giving lectures and boxing demonstrations and taking part in exhibition bouts.

Mills returned to the UK and was demobilised in March 1946, and in May 1946 he was given a shot at Lesnevich&#x27;s world light-heavyweight title. Mills&#x27; preparation was interrupted in April when his father died at his home in Bournemouth. The fight took place at Harringay Arena in front of 11,000 fans. Mills was not considered a serious threat to Lesnevich but performed better than many expected in what was described as a &quot;slam-bang, punishing contest&quot;. Mills was floored heavily in the second round but recovered strongly and was cheered on by the British crowd. In the ninth round, Mills&#x27;s aggression appeared to be turning the fight in his favour, and Lesnevich was troubled by cuts above his eyes. In the tenth, however, Lesnevich &quot;exploded&quot; to score two knockdowns and the referee stopped the contest.

Three weeks after losing his fight against Lesnevich, Mills fought British heavyweight Bruce Woodcock, losing a twelve-round fight on points after being knocked down in the fourth.

Mills returned in August 1946 with a first-round knockout of the Swedish heavyweight John Nilsson. In November 1946, Mills fought another heavyweight, American Joe Baksi. Mills suffered two badly cut eyes and retired after six rounds of what was described as a &quot;disappointingly one-sided contest&quot;.

===European title===
In 1947, Mills again focused on the light-heavyweight division, and had three wins by knockout in the first half of the year (one against Italian champion Enrico Bertola and the third against South African champion Nick Wolmarans in Johannesburg) before losing in June by KO to American Lloyd Marshall.

In September 1947, Mills fought for the vacant European light-heavyweight title against the Belgian, Pol Goffaux, winning after Goffaux retired towards the end of the fourth round. Mills ended the year with a points win over French heavyweight Stephane Olek.

Mills defended the European title in February 1948, against the Spanish champion Paco Bueno, who was subjected to &quot;terrific punishment&quot; before being knocked out in the second round.

In April 1948 he beat the heavyweight Ken Shaw for a second time, in a final eliminator for the British title.

===World title===
On 26 July 1948, Mills was matched against Lesnevich for his second attempt at the world light heavyweight title. Mills was in much better shape for this fight, held at the White City Stadium, London in front of a 46,000 crowd. Lesnevich reportedly struggled to make the 175 pound limit, weighing in at 174¾ pounds, whereas Mills came in at 170½.

Lesnevich, who was a 1/3 betting favourite, suffered from cuts over the eyes from the opening round as Mills started strongly. The fight then settled down into a &quot;remarkably dull&quot; affair, which drew boos from the crowd and saw both men warned by the referee Teddy Waltham for the lack of action. In the tenth round, Mills rallied and floored Lesnevich heavily on two occasions. Lesnevich launched a &quot;savage attack&quot; in the twelfth and thirteenth rounds, but Mills responded in the last two sessions and at the end of fifteen rounds, the British boxer was awarded the decision by the referee.

Mills was set to defend his title against Lesnevich in September in New York, but the fight was cancelled due to Mills suffering severe headaches and bouts of dizziness since the July fight. In August medical opinion was sought and he was diagnosed with misaligned vertebrae at the base of the skull; It was decided that after two months rest and spinal treatment he could return to boxing.

In September 1948, Mills was challenged to a fight at light-heavyweight by Sugar Ray Robinson, but it was dismissed as &quot;ridiculous&quot; by promoter Jack Solomons.

Mills beat another heavyweight, Johnny Ralph, in Johannesburg in November 1948 in an eliminator for the Empire heavyweight title. Mills broke a metacarpal in his right hand during the fight.

In early 1949, after a well-received appearance with Arthur Askey on the radio show &quot;How Do You Do?&quot;, Mills expressed a desire to work in radio after his boxing career ended, stating &quot;I am not going on fighting for ever. I&#x27;ve got some money now. I reckon that being on the radio would just about suit me.&quot; In March 1949, Mills signed a promotional contract with Solomons, which made any return fight with Lesnevich more likely to take place in Britain.

In June 1949, Mills challenged Bruce Woodcock for his British, Empire, and European heavyweight titles. The fight was also recognised as an eliminator for the British version of the World Heavyweight Championship. They fought at the White City Stadium, with Mills conceding twenty pounds in weight to his opponent. Mills bloodied the heavyweight&#x27;s nose but was floored four times before being knocked out in the fourteenth round.

Shortly after the Woodcock fight, Mills expressed a willingness to defend his light-heavyweight title later that year, although he wanted the purse money to be spread over five years, for tax reasons, and to guarantee him an income for several years after retiring from the ring, Mills clearly not intending to keep fighting for much longer.

In September 1949, a contract was signed for Mills to defend his world title against American Joey Maxim. After several dates and venues were proposed, the fight was finally set for 24 January 1950 at Earls Court, London. Mills decided to leave long-time trainer Nat Sellers and train himself for the fight. Mills began strongly but Maxim, who &quot;boxed beautifully&quot;, began to overhaul him. Mills, according to press reports, looked for a knockout win, but in the tenth round he was floored by a left right combination. Mills took the count in a sitting position before falling sideways and being counted out. Mills was assisted to his corner and was checked by a doctor before leaving the ring. He had fought the last four rounds with three of his teeth knocked out and one embedded in the gum of his upper jaw. Mills&#x27; reign as world champion was over, and the next day Broadribb announced that he had decided to retire, a decision made formal on 15 February when Mills wrote to BBBofC to confirm his retirement and to relinquish his British, European, and Empire light-heavyweight titles, aged 30.

== Personal life ==
On 30 September 1948, Mills married Christine Marie McCorkindale (&quot;Chrissie&quot;) (25 December 1913 – 4 November 1994) at Herne Hill Methodist Church. She had a son, Donnie, by former husband Don McCorkindale. They honeymooned in South Africa, where they stayed with McCorkindale, with whom Mills was good friends.

Mills and his wife went on to have two daughters, Susan Marhea (born 17 June 1952) and Amanda Christine Elizabeth (born 12 June 1958). They lived, with Donnie, at Joggi Villa in Denmark Hill in South London from June 1947.

== Retirement and other business interests ==

===Boxing management and promotion===
A month after confirming his retirement, Mills was granted a manager&#x27;s licence by the BBBofC, taking on Brixton heavyweight Terry O&#x27;Connor as his first boxer. In June 1950, Mills&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Twenty Years&quot;, was published. In 1951 he gained a promoter&#x27;s licence and put on many successful events until the mid-1950s.

During the latter stages of his boxing career, Mills suffered from frequent headaches, which continued after his retirement. Mills taught boxing classes at the Streatham Youth Centre in the early 1960s.

In October 1962 his world championship belt was stolen from his car, but it was returned three days later with a note from the thief apologising for stealing it.

===Entertainment===
Mills made an appearance on the television show &quot;Rooftop Rendezvous&quot; in February 1950, earning praise for his comedy skills. In May 1950 he did his first television commentary on the Dennis Powell v. Mel Brown card at Birmingham, broadcast by the BBC, which saw him described as &quot;discovery of the week&quot; by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. In late 1950 he again appeared on radio as a presenter of the programme &quot;Calling All Forces&quot;. In March 1952 he was given a 12-week Saturday radio show by the BBC. In 1952 he made his first film appearance in &quot;Emergency Call&quot;, going on to take small rôles in a dozen films.

In September 1954 he was knocked unconscious during a TV sketch after being hit over the head with a real stool rather than the prop that should have been used. He made appearances on several other television and radio shows, and became a presenter on the BBC pop-music programme &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; from February 1957 until being dropped from the show in March 1958, although he returned for the final show at the end of the year. He went on to perform on stage as part of &quot;The Dickie Henderson Show&quot; later that year, staying with Henderson until the early 1960s. In 1959 he performed in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; in Hulme, playing Idle Jack. In 1961 he appeared in a Summer stage show in Brighton with Alfred Marks.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, having been led into the foyer of London&#x27;s Earls Court Exhibition Centre by sports journalist Derrick Collier. The episode was broadcast on 2 January 1961.

By 1963, television appearances had become less frequent, although he appeared on variety show &quot;Big Night Out&quot; in January 1964.

===Property, restaurant and night club===
Mills began investing in property in the late 1940s, acquiring several houses and flats. In 1946 he opened the Freddie Mills Chinese Restaurant at 143 Charing Cross Road as a joint venture with Charles Luck and actor Andy Ho. He also briefly jointly owned a café in Peckham with his friend and investment adviser Bill Bavin. By 1963 the Chinese restaurant was no longer profitable, and Mills and Ho converted it to a nightclub (&#x27;The Freddie Mills Nite Spot&#x27;) at a cost of around £12,000, re-opening in May that year. After initially hoping to make the club a family venue, they were pressured into allowing &#x27;hostesses&#x27; to work there, unknown to Mills a euphemism for prostitutes. He became friends with the Kray Twins, notorious criminals who frequented his club. In August 1963 Mills and Ho started the Freddie Mills Theatrical Agency, based at the club.

After its initial success his nightclub began to fail and he tried to sell it, without success. He sold off what property he had but was in serious financial difficulty.

== Death ==
On 24 July 1965, Mills was found dead in his car, parked in Goslett Yard, off an alleyway behind his nightclub. A fairground rifle was found in the car with Mills, who had been shot through his right eye.
He had told the nightclub staff that he was going for a nap in his car, something that he often did. His body was found at approximately 11:45 p.m. by doorman Robert Deacon.
An ambulance was not called until Mills&#x27; wife arrived over an hour later. A week or two previously, he had borrowed a 0.22 calibre rifle from May Ronaldson, whom he knew from his boxing booth days, and who ran a shooting gallery. Although the rifle was not in working order when borrowed, it had apparently been repaired and was found in the car alongside him.
For whatever reason, still unknown and with no police in attendance, ambulance personnel removed Mills from his car, disturbing a possible crime scene, and transported his body to the Middlesex Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The investigation into his death initially assumed murder, but within a couple of days, the police had decided not to investigate it as such. The coroner&#x27;s inquest heard that the angle of the bullet was consistent with a self-inflicted wound, and it ruled his death a suicide.

Mills&#x27;s funeral took place at St. Giles’ Parish Church, Camberwell, and he was buried in Camberwell New Cemetery, South London. The pallbearers included boxing promoter Jack Solomons, British Heavyweight Champion Henry Cooper, the Secretary of the BBBofC, Teddy Waltham, and entertainer Bruce Forsyth (who also gave the funeral address). His grave has a marble boxing glove on it, beneath which is an urn containing a real boxing glove.

Despite the wealth that Mills had gained from his boxing career (estimated at £100,000), and his property investments that earned him around £3,000 per year, Mills died with a net figure of only £387 to his name. His club had been up for sale since June 1963, but he had been unable to find a buyer. At the time of his death, he was heavily in debt to a crime syndicate, which led him to be both depressed and in fear of his life. He was rumoured to be making a stand against protection racketeers shortly before his death, a theory backed up by gangland enforcer Johnny Bradbury, who gave the name of the man he believed was responsible for killing Mills to the police, but they were unable to find evidence to pursue the matter. Two weeks before his death, Mills and Ho had been fined for liquor and gaming offences committed at the club, and Mills had asked for a catering job at a pub near his home.

A star-studded benefit show, &quot;The Freddie Mills Night&quot;, was staged in February 1966 to raise money to support his widow and children.

Following his death, several lurid theories sprang up, such as that Mills, married with children, had been arrested in a public toilet and charged with indecency, and that his suicide had been staged by Chinese gangsters who were seeking to take over his club. In 2002, a book about Mills by former journalist Michael Litchfield contained allegations that at the time of his death he was about to be exposed as the serial killer known as &quot;Jack the Stripper&quot;, the unidentified person responsible for the eight Hammersmith nude murders in 1964–65. Litchfield also claimed that Mills had had a homosexual relationship with singer Michael Holliday, and possibly also was sexually involved with notorious gangster Ronnie Kray.

Mills&#x27;s family and friends did not accept the suicide verdict, and according to Bavin, his widow received a phone call some time after his death from a woman who told her who was responsible for killing him. In 1968, Leonard &quot;Nipper&quot; Read began investigating the case again at Chrissie&#x27;s behest. There were some inconsistencies regarding the death: two shots had been fired in the car, one from a front seat which hit the nearside front door, and the one that had killed Mills while he was sitting on the car&#x27;s back seat, Mills&#x27;s body was found with its hands resting on his knees and the gun in a position out of Mills&#x27;s reach, and there were no fingerprints found on it.

In November 1970, police began investigating again after a constituent had told MP Michael O&#x27;Halloran that a man had admitted killing Mills, although the investigation was soon ended.

Phoenix Television produced a documentary about the death of Mills, &quot;Murder in Soho: Who Killed Freddie Mills?&quot; Directed by Simon Dales, it was first broadcast by the BBC on 1 August 2018. The film explored the possibility that American mobster, Meyer Lansky, colluded in the killing of Mills; Roger Huntman, said his father, Benny Huntman, a boxing manager was involved in the murder.

== Evaluation as a boxer ==
The boxing statistics site BoxRec rates Mills as the fourteenth-best British boxer of all time, the second-best British boxer of all time in the light-heavyweight division (behind John Conteh), and the thirty-sixth-best light-heavyweight in the history of boxing.

He holds triple nationality, originally being a citizen of Hungary and a naturalised citizen of both Australia and the United Kingdom. He unsuccessfully challenged Muhammad Ali for the heavyweight championship in 1975, losing by a unanimous decision. As an actor, he is best known for his role in the 1994 action film &quot;Street Fighter&quot; alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia.

Born in Szőreg, a southeastern suburb of Szeged in southern Hungary, Bugner and his family fled after the 1956 Soviet invasion and settled in Britain. Standing at with a prime weight of , Bugner twice held the British and British Commonwealth heavyweight titles and was a three-time European heavyweight champion. He was ranked among the world&#x27;s top ten heavyweights of the 1970s, fighting such opponents as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Ron Lyle, Jimmy Ellis, Manuel Ramos, Chuck Wepner, Earnie Shavers, Henry Cooper, Brian London, Mac Foster, Rudie Lubbers, Eduardo Corletti, Jurgen Blin and George Johnson. The Telegraph also ranked him among the top ten British heavyweight boxers of all time.

Bugner retired from boxing in 1976 but made sporadic comebacks over the next two decades with varying success. He moved to Australia in 1986, adopting the nickname &quot;Aussie Joe,&quot; beating fighters such as Greg Page, David Bey, Anders Eklund and James Tillis before retiring again after a TKO loss to Frank Bruno in 1987. He made a final comeback during the 1990s, winning the Australian heavyweight title in 1995 and the lightly regarded World Boxing Federation (WBF) heavyweight championship in 1998 at the age of 48 against James &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith. He retired for the last time in 1999 with a final record of 69–13–1, including 43 wins by knockout.

==Early years==
Bugner and his family fled to the United Kingdom in the late 1950s because of the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Hungary in 1956 after the Hungarian Uprising of that year. Initially, he was one of about 80 refugees housed in the students&#x27; Hostel at Smedley&#x27;s factory in Wisbech. They settled in the Huntingdonshire town of St Ives near the Fens. So, as local custom dictated, he was known as a Fen Tiger. Bugner excelled in sports at school and was the national junior discus champion in 1964. He lived and trained in Bedford during his early boxing years; he was a regular at Bedford Boys Club under the training of Paul King and attended Goldington Road School in Bedford.

==Boxing career==

===1960s===
Throughout his brief amateur career, Bugner competed sixteen times, winning thirteen matches. On the recommendation of his then-trainer and buddy, Andy Smith, he became a professional in 1967 (at the very young age of 17). Smith was unhappy with the choice of Bugner&#x27;s opponents and believed that he could better control the quality of his opponents if Bugner turned professional. He had a losing debut against Paul Brown on 20 December 1967 at the London Hilton, where he suffered a TKO in the third round. Showing gritty determination after his debut, the teenage Bugner went on to win a remarkable 18 consecutive fights in under two years during 1968 and 1969 (including 13 stoppage victories) before narrowly losing to the older and vastly more experienced Dick Hall. He bounced back and rounded off the 1960s with three further stoppage victories.

===1970s===
In 1970 Bugner emerged internationally as an outstanding young prospect and was world-rated by the end of the year. He won nine consecutive bouts that year, including victories over well-known boxers such as Chuck Wepner, Manuel Ramos, Johnny Prescott, Brian London, Eduardo Corletti, Charley Polite, and George Johnson.

Bugner was now positioned to challenge world-rated Englishman Henry Cooper, who had nearly knocked out Muhammad Ali a few years previously, for Cooper&#x27;s British, British Commonwealth and European titles. However, because Bugner was still too young to fight for the British Commonwealth title (the minimum age was twenty-one years old at the time), this much-anticipated bout had to be postponed until the following year. While waiting to come of age, in 1971, he defeated Carl Gizzi and drew with Bill Drover just weeks later and weeks before facing Cooper.

Bugner earned a reputation early in his professional years as a tough, durable but often exceptionally defensive and cautious boxer; he retained that image for the rest of his career. He was often criticised for lacking natural aggression in the ring. Some observers argued that Bugner&#x27;s heart was never in boxing after an early opponent, Ulric Regis, died from brain injuries soon after being outpointed by Bugner at London&#x27;s Shoreditch Town Hall. Many said that Bugner never punched his full weight after that.

====Defeat of Henry Cooper====
In March 1971, Bugner met veteran Cooper and won a fifteen-round decision. Bugner won the bout by the slimmest of margins, 1/4 point, on the card of the lone official, Harry Gibbs. The British sporting public and press were deeply divided about the verdict. Many felt that Cooper deserved the decision due to his steady aggression. But Bugner fought effectively on the defence and often scored with his left jab, and in the opinion of many, was the rightful winner of the bout. &quot;The Times&quot;, among others, scored the fight in favour of Bugner. Still, the outcome of the bout is regarded as one of the most controversial in British boxing history.

Nonetheless, Bugner was now the British, British Commonwealth, and European champion, and for the first time, he was ranked among the world&#x27;s top ten heavyweights. Bugner would remain in the world ratings for most of the 1970s.

Bugner retained his European title with a decision over tough German heavyweight Jürgen Blin. However, later in 1971, Bugner surprisingly lost decisions to underdogs Jack Bodell and Larry Middleton; sandwiched between these losses was a victory over Mike Boswell. The Bodell fight was particularly costly, depriving Bugner of his British, British Commonwealth and European championships. Bugner&#x27;s relative inexperience, his youth and lack of an extensive amateur background were the chief causes of these defeats.

In 1972 Bugner won eight consecutive fights, including a knockout over Jürgen Blin for the European championship. By the end of this, Bugner demonstrated much-improved ring ability and acquired enough experience that his manager began seeking matches against the world&#x27;s best heavyweights.

====Prime years====
Bugner began 1973 by retaining his European belt with a victory over the capable Dutchman Rudie Lubbers. The 23-year-old Bugner then lost twelve-round decisions to Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Despite being clearly defeated, Bugner fought well and won the respect of the boxing media and the public alike. After their bout, Ali declared that Bugner was capable of being world champion. Ali&#x27;s trainer Angelo Dundee later echoed that sentiment. The fight with Frazier in July 1973 at Earls Court in London was deemed a classic. After being knocked down by a tremendous left hook in the tenth round, Bugner arose and staggered Frazier to close the round. Frazier took the decision, but only narrowly, and arguably only George Foreman and Muhammad Ali ever gave Frazier a harder fight. Many regard the Frazier bout as being Bugner&#x27;s best career performance.

After the Ali and Frazier fights, Bugner won eight bouts in a row, his most notable victories being over ex-WBA world heavyweight champion Jimmy Ellis, and Mac Foster. By the end of 1974, Bugner was rated among the top five heavyweight contenders in the world.

Bugner challenged Muhammad Ali for the world championship in June 1975, the bout being held in Kuala Lumpur, with Ali winning a relatively one-sided fifteen-round decision. Bugner performed fairly well but maintained a strictly defensive posture throughout most of the fight, perhaps due to the blistering tropical heat, and as a result, he was widely scorned by the media and public. In an interview during an April 2008 reunion with Henry Cooper, Bugner defended his tactics in the Ali fight as having been necessary due to the extreme temperature and humidity of the outside venue.

====Regains British, European &amp; Commonwealth titles====

Early in 1976, Bugner announced his retirement from boxing, stating that he no longer felt motivated to fight professionally. Within months however he returned to the ring, expressing disgust at Richard Dunn&#x27;s performance against Ali and in October, he blasted out Richard Dunn in the first round to reclaim the British, British Commonwealth and European championships. Onlookers state that they had never seen Bugner angry before and that while Dunn&#x27;s supporters had waged a quite unsportsmanlike campaign against Bugner, if he had fought like that in his earlier career, he could have gone further.

In 1977, Bugner lost a close twelve-round decision away from home to top contender Ron Lyle. The scores were 57–53 and 56–54 for Lyle against 55–54 for Bugner. After this bout, Bugner again retired, making only sporadic comebacks to the ring over the next decades.

===1980s===
Bugner returned to the ring for brief periods in the 1980s and 1990s but was never as effective as he had been during his prime due to his age and inactivity.

After a three-year absence from the ring, Bugner returned in May 1980, knocking out fringe contender Gilberto Acuna, before promptly retiring again. In 1982, a ring-rusty Bugner (having had only one short fight in five years and weighing in some 25 lbs above his prime fighting weight) fought the hard-hitting top contender Earnie Shavers, but was stopped in the second round due to a badly cut eye. However, Bugner decided to continue his comeback, stopping the useful John Denis and fringe contender Danny Sutton, as well as domestic contenders Winston Allen and Eddie Neilson. In 1983, a subdued and unmotivated Bugner lost to Marvis Frazier, showing little ambition throughout the bout. He followed this with a decision over future European champion Anders Eklund and a controversial loss to future world title challenger Steffen Tangstad. Bugner appeared to have done enough to win the Tangstad fight, however, like with the Frazier and Eklund bouts, he appeared unmotivated and uninterested throughout.

====Comeback in Australia====
In 1986 Bugner moved to Australia, where he adopted the nickname &quot;Aussie Joe&quot; after becoming an Australian citizen. In Australia, Bugner launched a fairly successful comeback, earning good victories over world title contenders James Tillis and David Bey and an impressive victory over former WBA heavyweight champion Greg Page, gaining a world ranking in the process, after which he spoke of challenging reigning heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. However, there was great clamour for a fight with fellow Briton Frank Bruno. The bout was touted as the biggest all-British heavyweight bout since Cooper Vs Bugner in 1971. The bout took place on 24 October 1987, and Bugner suffered an eighth-round TKO loss to the much younger and fresher world title contender for the Commonwealth championship in front of a huge crowd at White Hart Lane football stadium. Bugner promptly retired again following this defeat, only his third stoppage defeat in 20 years.

===1990s===

Inspired by the 45-year-old George Foreman&#x27;s recapture of the heavyweight title, Bugner made a final comeback in 1995, beating Vince Cervi to win the Australian heavyweight title, followed by a win over West Turner. Bugner then fought fellow Briton and world title contender Scott Welch for the WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. Welch proved too young and fresh for the now 46-year-old Bugner, handing him a TKO defeat in the 6th round.

Bugner continued to fight on against far younger opponents. In 1996 he defeated the respectable Young Haumona for the Pacific and Australasian Heavyweight title, retained it against Waisiki Ligaloa in 1997, added the Australian title by defeating the tough Colin Wilson and defending both titles against Bob Mirovic in 1998.

In 1998 Bugner&#x27;s long-term tenacity finally gave him a world crown, albeit a lightly regarded title - the WBF version of the heavyweight crown - by defeating former WBA World Heavyweight Champion James &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith. At the age of 48 years and 110 days, it made him the oldest ever boxer to hold a minor championship belt.

Bugner fought just once more. In June 1999, at the age of 49, he defeated the durable fringe contender Levi Billups, who was disqualified for low blows.

==Fight record==
His record for 83 professional fights is 69 wins (41 on knockouts), 13 Losses and 1 Draw.

In an interview in 2004, Bugner said that the hardest puncher he had ever faced was Earnie Shavers and the biggest beating he took was from Ron Lyle.

==Life outside boxing==
After moving to Australia, Bugner and his wife, Marlene, opened a vineyard. It failed in 1989, and he lost an estimated two million Australian dollars. He now lives in Brisbane, Queensland.

Bugner has worked in the film industry. During the 1970s, he appeared in one of several PSAs themed &quot;Be Smart, Be Safe&quot;; these dealt with instructing children on how to safely cross a road or a street. In 1979 Bugner featured in an Italian film, &quot;Io sto con gli ippopotami&quot; with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, he worked with Bud Spencer in his films in the 1980s. He worked as the expert adviser on the Russell Crowe film, &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, which was a film about the heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock. Bugner was dropped part way through the project, which prompted him to call Crowe, &quot;a gutless worm and a f*****g girl&quot;.

Bugner suffers from a serious back injury he sustained from training for fights in his middle years. He also has financial problems. These financial problems prompted him to re-enter the ring at such an advanced age. A benefit was held for Bugner in 2008 by Kevin Lueshing.

In November 2009, Bugner replaced Camilla Dallerup on day 4 of the British TV show &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!&quot;. He left the show on day 16 after losing a bushtucker trial called &#x27;Jungle Jail&#x27; to fellow celebrity Stuart Manning.

Bugner has three children, James, Joe Jr., and Amy, from his ex-wife Melody.

Bugner&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Joe Bugner – My Story&quot;, was published by New Holland Publishing (Australia) in November 2013.

<text>Sir Henry Cooper (3 May 19341 May 2011) was a British heavyweight boxer. He was undefeated in British and Commonwealth heavyweight championship contests for twelve years and held the European heavyweight title for three years. In a 1963 fight against a young Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali), he knocked Clay down in Round 4, before the fight was stopped in Round 5 because of a cut to Cooper&#x27;s eye.

In 1966 he fought Ali for a second time. Ali was then world heavyweight champion. However, Cooper got TKO&#x27;d again. Cooper was twice voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year and, after retiring in 1971 following a controversial loss to Joe Bugner, remained a popular public figure. He is the only British boxer to have been awarded a knighthood.

==Early life==

Cooper was born on Thursday, 3 May 1934 in Lambeth, London to Henry Snr and Lily Cooper. With identical twin brother, George (1934–2010), and elder brother Bern, he grew up in a council house on Farmstead Road on the Bellingham Estate in South East London. During the Second World War they were evacuated to Lancing on the Sussex coast.

Life was tough in the latter years of the Second World War, and London life especially brought many dangers during the blackout. Cooper took up many jobs, including a paper round before school, and made money out of recycling golf balls to the clubhouse on the Beckenham course. All three of the Cooper brothers excelled in sport, with George and Henry exercising talents particularly in football and also cricket. Cooper started his boxing career in 1949, as an amateur with the Bellingham Boxing Club based at Athelney St School in Bellingham which was run and founded by Albert Colley and won seventy-three of eighty-four contests. At the age of seventeen, he won the first of two ABA light-heavyweight titles before National Service in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps as Private Service Number 22486464.

===1952 Olympics===
Cooper represented Great Britain as a light heavyweight boxer at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. His results were: Round of 32-bye, Round of 16-lost to Anatoly Perov (Soviet Union) by decision, 1–2.

==Professional boxing career==

===Style===
Although Cooper was left-handed, he used the &quot;orthodox&quot; stance, with his strongest (left) hand and foot forward, rather than the reversed &quot;southpaw&quot; stance more usually adopted by a left-handed boxer. Opponents were thus hit hardest with punches which Cooper could throw from his front hand, closest to the opponent. At its most effective, his hook - dubbed &quot;Enry&#x27;s &#x27;Ammer&quot; (&quot;Henry&#x27;s hammer&quot;) - had an upward uppercut-like trajectory. A formidable left jab, from which he could hook quickly, completed his offensive repertoire. While cut-prone and no great defensive technician, Cooper compensated by forcing the action in his bouts. After developing a left shoulder problem in the latter half of his career, he adjusted to put more stress on right-handed punches.

===Early bouts===
Henry and his identical twin brother, George (boxing under the name Jim) turned professional together under the management of Jim Wicks. Wicks had a reputation for not overmatching his boxers and looking out for their interests; however, the very cut-prone Cooper was slow to fulfil his potential and early title challenges were unsuccessful, with losses to West Indian Joe Bygraves for the Commonwealth belt (KO 9), Ingemar Johansson for the European belt (KO 5), and the undersized but highly skilled Joe Erskine (PTS 15) for the British and Commonwealth. An impressive points win over top American heavyweight Zora Folley was followed by a second-round KO loss to Folley about 3 years later in their rematch.

===British and Commonwealth Champion===
For Cooper 1959 was a banner year: he took the British and Commonwealth titles from Brian London in 15 rounds and received the last 9-carat gold Lonsdale Belt after successful defences against Dick Richardson (KO 5), Joe Erskine (TKO 5, TKO 12, and TKO 9), and Johnny Prescott (RTD 10). Another points win over London brought an offer to fight Floyd Patterson for his world heavyweight title, but this was turned down by Cooper (or Wicks).

===Muhammad Ali===

In 1963 Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay and a contender for the world heavyweight title) created a great deal of ticket-selling publicity before his London bout with Cooper, who many British fans hoped would be able to humble the brash young American. In the boxing world, however, Ali was considered a future world champion and Cooper the underdog. The contest took place at Wembley Stadium, Wembley Park. According to the official weigh-in, Ali outweighed Cooper by 21 pounds, Cooper said he wore weighted clothing and was near the light heavyweight limit. Cooper had devised his own training regimen and felt that though lighter he was in the best condition of his career.

Ali&#x27;s size, mobility, fast reflexes, and unorthodox defensive tactic of pulling back from punches made him a frustratingly elusive opponent, and Cooper was later accused by Ali&#x27;s camp of hitting on the break. A stiff connection by Ali split open the face of Cooper in the middle of round three, beginning a gush of blood into his left eye. Ali, sensing the fight would be stopped because of the cut, began abandoning attempts of offense and instead began teasing and taunting Cooper, lowering his guard and leaving his jaw exposed to the Brit. Despite Ali&#x27;s taunts and his bloody left eye, Cooper connected with a solitary left hook to the body; in the fourth&#x27;s final seconds, Cooper felled Ali with an upward angled version of his trademark left hook to the jaw, &quot;Enry&#x27;s &#x27;Ammer&quot;. Ali partly landed on the ropes, preventing his head hitting the canvas covered boards, but though up at the count of 3 he seemed hurt.

In the corner Dundee was angry and slapped Ali&#x27;s legs. Ali misunderstood and tried to get off the stool. It has been claimed that Dundee may have used smelling salts to revive Ali. This has never been confirmed and the film is unclear if this happened. The use of smelling salts was prohibited in British boxing, and their use would have led to Ali losing by disqualification if the offence was proved. Dundee later said that he put his finger in a small tear in one of Ali&#x27;s gloves to demonstrate to the referee and told the referee that his fighter needed replacements, but none were available. Cooper insisted that resulted in a delay of a minute or more in addition to the regulation time between rounds, and denied him a chance to finish off Ali while he was still dazed. A tape of the fight showed an interval extension of only an extra six seconds.

Cooper was the only person present who recalled a longer delay and because the surviving BBC tape of the bout is only of what was actually broadcast, it has been claimed a longer delay may have been edited out for transmission. Study of the tape shows no break and the commentary is also unbroken so the 6 second interval extension is correct. Ali started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good his prediction of a 5th-round knockout and opened a severe cut under Cooper&#x27;s eye. Ali hit Cooper with a succession of hard rights knocking out his gumshield and Cooper&#x27;s corner threw in the towel. Referee Tommy Little stopped the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout. Subsequently, a spare pair of gloves was always required at ringside. On the 40th anniversary of the fight, Ali telephoned Cooper to reminisce.

In 1966 Cooper fought Ali for the heavyweight championship, for a second time at Arsenal Stadium, Highbury. However, Ali was now alert to the danger posed by Cooper&#x27;s left and more cautious than he had been in the previous contest; he held Cooper in a vice-like grip during clinches, and when told to break leapt backward several feet. Accumulated scar tissue around Cooper&#x27;s eyes made him more vulnerable than in the previous meeting and a serious cut was opened by Ali, which led to the fight being stopped, Cooper again losing to Ali via technical knockout.

===Later fights===
After a fourth-round knockout loss to former world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in 1966, Cooper went undefeated until the final contest of his career. The successful defences of his British and Commonwealth titles against the likes of uniquely awkward Jack Bodell (TKO 2) and media-savvy Billy Walker (TKO 6) made Cooper the only man to win three Lonsdale Belts. With a win over Karl Mildenberger in 1968 Cooper added the European crown and made two successful defences. In 1970, Cooper would vacate his British Heavyweight Title after attempting to arrange a fight with World Boxing Association champion, Jimmy Ellis. However, the British Boxing Board of Control refused to sanction the match, citing they would only recognize a match between fellow champion Joe Frazier and a ranked opponent. Cooper and Bodell would rematch that year, with Bodell now defending his British Title after winning the vacated title from Carl Gizzi, and Cooper defending his Commonwealth title. Cooper would win the match over a 15-Round points decision, regaining his British title.

In May 1971, a 36-year-old Cooper faced 21-year-old Joe Bugner, one of the biggest heavyweights in the world for the British, European, and Commonwealth belts. Referee Harry Gibbs awarded the fight to Bugner by a quarter of a point score (which was subsequently abolished partly because of the controversy that followed). An audience mainly composed of Cooper fans did not appreciate the innately cautious Bugner, and the decision was booed with commentator Harry Carpenter asking, &quot;And how, in the world, can you take away the man&#x27;s three titles, like that?&quot; Cooper announced his retirement shortly afterwards. Cooper refused to speak to Gibbs for many years, but eventually agreed to shake his hand while they were at a charity event.

===Opinion on modern boxers===
In Cooper&#x27;s later years, he retired from commentary on the sport as he became &quot;disillusioned with boxing&quot;, wanting &quot;straight, hard and fast boxing that he was used to from his times.&quot; While acknowledging that he was from a different era and would not be fighting as a heavyweight today, Cooper was nonetheless critical of the trend for heavyweights to bulk up as he thought it made for one-paced and less entertaining contests. In his final year, he said that he did not think boxing was &quot;as good as it was&quot;, naming Joe Calzaghe, Ricky Hatton, and Amir Khan as &quot;the best of their era&quot;, but asserting that &quot;if you match them up with the champions of thirty or forty years ago I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as good&quot;.

==Life outside boxing==
In the 1960s Cooper appeared in several public information films concerning road safety, promoting the use of zebra crossings: such as &quot;The Story of Elsie Billing&quot;. After his retirement from boxing, he maintained a public profile with appearances in the BBC quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; and various advertisements, most famously in those for Brut aftershave. He was also a frequent guest speaker for charity fund-raising events. He appeared as boxer John Gully in the 1975 film &quot;Royal Flash&quot; and in his latter years featured in a series of UK public service announcements urging vulnerable groups to go to their doctors for vaccination against influenza called &quot;Get your Jab in First!&quot;

Cooper became a &quot;Name&quot; at Lloyd&#x27;s of London, which was a supposedly safe investment, but in the 1990s he was reportedly one of those who suffered enormous personal losses because of the unlimited liability which a &quot;Name&quot; was then responsible for, being forced to sell his Lonsdale belts. Subsequently, Cooper&#x27;s popularity as an after dinner speaker provided a source of income, and he was in most respects a picture of contentment although becoming more subdued in the years following his wife&#x27;s sudden death aged 71.

Considering his long career, Cooper had suffered relatively little boxing-related damage to his health, and apart from &quot;a bit of arthritis&quot; remained an imposing figure: in the words of one journalist, &quot;the living manifestation of an age of tuxedos in ringside seats, Harry Carpenter commentaries, sponge buckets and &#x27;seconds out&#x27;&quot;. He lived in Hildenborough, Kent, where he was the president of Nizels Golf Club.

Cooper was married to Albina Genepri from 1960 until 2008 (her death). He converted to her Catholic faith and described Albina, who &quot;hated&quot; his sport, as &quot;an ideal wife for a boxer&quot;, never grumbling about his long absences before big fights and inviting journalists in for tea while they waited for Cooper to get out of bed the morning after bouts. Cooper died on May 1, 2011, 2 days before his 77th birthday. He was survived by their sons and two grandchildren.

Cooper was a lifelong Arsenal supporter.

==Awards and honours==

Cooper was the first to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award twice, in 1967 for going unbeaten and in 1970, when Cooper had become the British, Commonwealth, and European heavyweight champion. He is the only British boxer to win three Lonsdale Belts outright.

Cooper was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1969 New Year Honours for services to boxing, awarded a Papal Knighthood in 1978, and was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours, again for services to boxing. He is also celebrated as one of the great Londoners in the &quot;London Song&quot; by Ray Davies on his 1998 album &quot;The Storyteller&quot;. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Thames Television&#x27;s Euston Road Studios.

<text>Judith Gail Biggert (née Borg; born August 15, 1937) is an American politician and attorney. She is the former U.S. Representative for , serving from 1999 to 2013. She is a member of the Republican Party.

Biggert was defeated in her 2012 re-election bid by former US Congressman Bill Foster. She was also the last Republican woman elected to Congress from Illinois until the election of Mary Miller of the 15th congressional district in 2020.

Prior to serving in Congress, she served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1993 to 1998. After leaving Congress, she was appointed to serve on the Illinois Education Labor Relations Board.

==Early life, education and career==
Biggert was born Judith Gail Borg in Chicago on August 15, 1937, the second of four children of Alvin Andrew Borg and Marjorie Virginia (Mailler) Borg. Her father worked for the Chicago-based Walgreen Co., the largest drugstore chain in the United States, for 41 years from 1928 to 1969, and served as its president from 1963 to 1969, succeeding Charles R. Walgreen Jr. and succeeded by Charles R. Walgreen III. Her paternal grandparents immigrated from Finland and her maternal family is of English descent.

She grew up in Wilmette, Illinois, a North Shore Chicago suburb, and graduated from New Trier High School in 1955, then went to Stanford University, where she received a B.A. in international relations in 1959, then worked for a year in a women&#x27;s apparel store. She then attended Northwestern University School of Law where she was an editor of the Northwestern University Law Review from 1961 to 1963, earned a J.D. in 1963, then clerked for federal judge Luther Merritt Swygert of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 1963 to 1964.

Biggert left her federal court law clerkship to have her children, but later did some legal work from her home for family and friends on wills, trusts, and real estate. She served on numerous boards of voluntary and civic organizations.

==Early community involvement and political career==
Biggert was elected to the Hinsdale Township High School District 86 Board of Education in 1978 and was a board member until 1985, serving as president from 1983 to 1985. She served as chairman of the Hinsdale Plan Commission from 1989 to 1993. She also became active in Chicago community organizations, serving as chair of the Visiting Nurses Association and as president of the Junior League.

==Political campaigns==

===1998===

In 1998, Biggert narrowly defeated (45%-40%) conservative state Senator Peter Roskam in the Republican primary, the real contest in this ancestrally Republican district. In the general she earned 61% of the vote to win the seat opened up by the retirement of U. S. Representative Harris Fawell. In 2006, Roskam was elected to Congress from another district.

===2006===

In 2006, Biggert&#x27;s share of the vote in the general election fell below 60% (58%) for the first time in her Congressional career.

===2008===

In 2008, Biggert received less than 54% of the vote overall (and less than 50% of the vote in Will County) in winning reelection to her sixth term in Congress. For the first time, she faced a financially competitive Democratic opponent, businessman Scott Harper, the first reasonably well-financed Democrat to run in the district or its predecessors in decades. In 2008, Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin was reelected with 60% of the vote and Democrat Barack Obama won 54% of the vote in the 13th Congressional District, with even Biggert&#x27;s Republican predecessor, Fawell, supporting Obama.

===2010===
Biggert won re-election.

===2012===

In the redistricting following the 2010 census, the Democratic-controlled state legislature significantly altered Illinois&#x27;s congressional map, splitting Biggert&#x27;s district. Her district was renumbered as the 11th District, and made significantly more Democratic even though it contains 50 percent of Biggert&#x27;s former territory. A portion of her former district that included Biggert&#x27;s home in Hinsdale was combined with the heavily Democratic Chicago North Side-based 5th District. Biggert opted to run in the new 11th against the Democratic nominee, former 14th District Congressman Bill Foster.

==Personal life==
On September 21, 1963, she married Rody Patterson Biggert, Jr. Rody and Judy Biggert lived in Chicago, then Wilmette, before moving to Hinsdale in 1971, when Rody&#x27;s mother sold them her home, the extensively remodeled 1864 mansion of Hinsdale&#x27;s founder, William Robbins, in the Robbins Park Historic District. The Biggerts have four children: Courtney Caverly, Alison Cabot, Rody Biggert, and Adrienne Morrell, and nine grandchildren. Her husband, Rody, died in November 2018 after an 18-month long struggle with leukemia at the age of 82.

Since 2004, Biggert&#x27;s youngest daughter Adrienne Morrell has been a registered lobbyist for Health Net, the sixth largest publicly traded for-profit managed healthcare company; previously Morrell was a lobbyist with America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the chief health insurance industry lobby, after having served as an aide to former seven-term Illinois 13th District U.S. Rep. Harris Fawell, Biggert&#x27;s predecessor in Congress.

In 2008, multimillionaire Biggert was the second wealthiest—after U.S. Rep. Bill Foster (D-14)—in Illinois&#x27;s 21-member Congressional delegation, and the 82nd wealthiest member in the U.S. House.

Biggert was president of the Junior Board of the Chicago Travelers Aid Society in 1969, and president of the Junior League of Chicago from 1976 to 1978, chairman of board of directors of the Visiting Nurse Association of Chicago in 1978, and president of the Oak School elementary school PTA in Hinsdale from 1976 to 1978. She was a member of the board of directors of the Salt Creek Ballet from 1990 to 1998. She was also a Sunday school teacher at Grace Episcopal Church in Hinsdale from 1974 to 1984, and an American Youth Soccer Organization assistant soccer coach in 1983.

<text>Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Wisdom is a fictional secret agent appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #86 (February 1995), and was created by Warren Ellis and Ken Lashley. Wisdom is a British Secret Service agent with the mutant ability to throw &quot;blades&quot; of energy (&quot;hot knives&quot;) from his fingertips.

Rob Delaney portrays Wisdom in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; and &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Publication history==
Pete Wisdom was initially created by Ellis and drawn by Ben Dilworth, in a pitch for &quot;Electric Angel&quot; for publisher Trident Comics. Wisdom was an angry young Essex man, with the power to summon electricity. Ellis said at Toronto Comicon 2005 that the character is based on Jack Regan from &quot;The Sweeney&quot;. Later, at Marvel, Wisdom formally debuted, his first appearance was as an agent for the British covert organization Black Air in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #86 (February 1995).

Along with Kitty Pryde, Peter starred in the &quot;Pryde and Wisdom&quot; three-issue miniseries, which introduced Wisdom&#x27;s sister Romany, as well as his father Harold, a retired Scotland Yard inspector. Soon after, Warren Ellis became the &#x27;plotmaster&#x27; of &quot;X-Force&quot; (Ian Edginton was the actual scripter). He next appeared in &quot;New Excalibur&quot; scripted by Chris Claremont. Originally, the series&#x27; mandate was to explore the fallout from &quot;House of M&quot; in Britain.

In November 2006, Pete Wisdom also starred in a six-issue limited series titled &quot;Wisdom&quot; under the MAX comics imprint. From May 2008 to July 2009 Wisdom appeared as one of the main characters in the series &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
Pete Wisdom was born to Scotland Yard detective-sergeant Harold Wisdom. He has a sister, Romany, who is an occultist, a former employee of the police&#x27;s Department of Unusual Deaths (Dept F.66) and ally of Union Jack. His mother was killed by mass murderer Michael Robert Ryan while waiting for Pete to visit, a visit he had blown off after an argument with her (both he and his father blame him for her death). He went on to join MI6 and later transferred to its fellow intelligence agency Black Air, where he alluded to having been in a relationship with his superior, Michelle Scicluna.

Due to being constantly sent out on wetworks (assassination assignments), he grows to hate his job and asks for a transfer. Scicluna tasks him to act as a non-combat adviser to Excalibur, who Black Air had requested to investigate in Genosha for them, and in return he will be permitted to leave Black Air. He borrows Excalibur transport to reach and help an old friend, being forced to take Kitty Pryde with him; the two of them end up investigating Black Air&#x27;s &quot;Dream Nails&quot; facility and the horrors within, and Wisdom is almost tortured to death by one of his employer&#x27;s agents. Following this he is invited to join Excalibur by Kitty and they start a relationship (leading to an ongoing feud between him and Lockheed).

Both Wisdom and Excalibur are able to expose Black Air&#x27;s links to the Hellfire Club, cripple the organization, and prevent its grand scheme. With Kitty, he teams up his father, his sister, and Department F.66 to track down an occult serial killer. A remnant cell of Black Air hires a contract killer and former girlfriend of Wisdom&#x27;s to assassinate him. He manages to escape, but has Nightcrawler briefly captured by the cell; the guilt causes him to become far more anti-social, driving Kitty away. Unwilling to see if the relationship can be salvaged, he leaves Excalibur.

After Excalibur, and now sporting an unnecessary eye patch to look sexy, he organizes a group of former intelligence operatives to strike out at black-ops agencies and individuals, and requests X-Force&#x27;s aid in recovering a cybernetic brain from Genosha, fighting Magneto in the process. Wisdom is later seen as the new leader of the team. He acts as a mentor and shows the team members how to use their mutant powers in new ways. When his sister Romany Wisdom returns as a villain, Pete Wisdom is apparently murdered. When the remainder of X-Force (with the exception of Domino) are presumed killed, Wisdom is revealed to still be alive. Wisdom&#x27;s survival is supposedly not known to any members of X-Force.

After M-Day, Wisdom retains his powers and is later ordered by MI-13 to find and team with Captain Britain. He joins New Excalibur. Outside of Excalibur, he works in a strike team for MI-13 that deals with &quot;weird happenings&quot;, clashing with MI-6, who feel that is their jurisdiction. As a result of his work, he ends up in an arranged marriage with his teammate Tink (a fairy) to cement a treaty between the United Kingdom and Otherworld. He begins a romance with teammate Maureen Raven, an Ulster-born psychic, but is eventually forced to kill her to end the Martian invasion of Britain.

Following the invasion, Wisdom once again teams with Captain Britain and other heroes to stop the Skrull invasion of Earth. He is contacted by Merlin, who directs Wisdom into setting him free to resurrect a (temporarily) deceased Captain Britain; in doing so, Wisdom has to knowingly open a prison for evil magics (as well as entities like Satannish). Now owed a boon by the dark forces, Wisdom is able to have a magical anti-Skrull shield erected around the British Isles, which leaves the nation under constant threat of the supernatural. Wisdom has to cope with the death of his friend, a John Lennon-impersonating Skrull who had worked with him and Spitfire to repel the invasion.

MI-13&#x27;s first battle is against the Duke of Hell Dr Plokta, who gains power when people willingly sell their souls to live in their heart&#x27;s desire; Wisdom is tempted with the fantasy of Kitty, Maureen and everyone he had gotten killed still being alive. His teammate Captain Midlands betrays them to Plokta in order to live in a fantasy where his wife had not died; disgusted and angry, Wisdom deliberately destroys his fantasy and has him arrested. Understanding how Midlands feels (due to his own losses), Pete shows him some mercy and gives him the chance to commit suicide.

In the United Kingdom&#x27;s war against Count Dracula, Wisdom takes a key command role. Despite an initial routing, he devises a successful tactic of using misinformation, a staged defeat, a blackmailed Plokta&#x27;s dream corridors, and pre-emptive strikes to prevent Dracula and his invasion force from realising the UK still has a magical spell that requires a vampire to be invited into its borders. The bulk of the vampire army is destroyed in an instant: Wisdom says that Dracula thought he was playing chess but you would only do so if you &quot;don&#x27;t care about the pieces... [otherwise] you cheat&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Peter Wisdom has the power to absorb ambient heat and solar radiation, and release the absorbed energy from his fingertips as &quot;hot knives&quot; of pure thermal energy, said to be as &quot;hot as the surface of the sun&quot;. He can leap from high distances and use the thermal energy to slow his descent. He can fire his hot knives as projectiles, or leave them attached to his fingertips like claws for close physical combat. He also has years of experience in espionage from working for Black Air and British Intelligence.

<doc id="412127" wikidata="Q963900" url="?curid=412127" title="Tony Zale">
<text>Anthony Florian Zaleski (May 29, 1913 – March 20, 1997), known professionally as Tony Zale, was an American boxer. Zale was born and raised in Gary, Indiana, a steel town, which gave him his nickname, &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, reinforced by his reputation of being able to take fearsome punishment and still rally to win. Zale, who held the world middleweight title multiple times, was known as a crafty boxer and punishing body puncher who wore his opponents down before knocking them out. In 1990, Zale was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George. H. W. Bush.

==World middleweight title==

Zale met Georgie Abrams in Madison Square Garden in a world middleweight championship match on November 28, 1941, before a crowd of nearly 10,000. Despite knocking Zale down in the first round, a poke in the eye from Zale&#x27;s glove left him with pain and blurred vision. From the fourth round on, Abrams fought with his left eye nearly closed. Blood from a cut opened above his right eye in the third from an accidental head butt from Zale caused additional vision problems from blood that dripped from the wound. Despite fighting half blind, Abrams fought courageously for fifteen rounds. Abrams lost in a close match, due to the incessant body attacks of Zale in the late rounds, particularly the ninth where he received a severe two handed attack to the midsection. The Associated Press judged Abrams the winner with eight rounds to Zale&#x27;s seven.

==Bouts against Rocky Graziano, 1946–48==
Zale was a two-time world middleweight champion and made &quot;The Ring&quot;″s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Zale is best remembered for his three bouts over a 21-month period with Rocky Graziano for the middleweight crown. These three bouts were among the most brutal and exciting middleweight championship matches of all time. The first match took place in Yankee Stadium, New York City. Zale had served in World War II, was thirty-three years old, and had been inactive for about four years. Graziano was on a winning knockout streak and seemed to be in his prime. In their first match (September 27, 1946), after flooring Graziano in the first round, Zale took a savage beating from Graziano, and was on the verge of losing the fight by TKO. However, he rallied and knocked out Graziano in the sixth round to retain his title. The rematch, a year later in Chicago (July 16, 1947), was a mirror image of their first fight. Graziano was battered around the ring, suffered a closed eye and appeared ready to lose by a knockout, then rallied and knocked Zale out in the sixth round, becoming middleweight champion of the world.

Their last fight was held in New Jersey the following year (June 10, 1948). Zale regained his crown, winning the match by a knockout in the third round. The knockout blows consisted of a perfect combination of a right to Graziano&#x27;s body, then a left hook to Graziano&#x27;s jaw. Graziano was knocked unconscious. This fight was Zale&#x27;s last hurrah. His age and the many ring wars he fought seemed to catch up with him in his next fight against European Champion Marcel Cerdan later that year, who stopped him in the eleventh round to win the middleweight championship of the world (September 21, 1948). Graziano commented that years later he would wake up in a cold sweat having had the recurring nightmare of being back in the ring with Zale, who he said really was a man of steel.

Edith Piaf, who at the time was having an affair with Cerdan, was in the audience, praying to Saint Therese for his victory. Two of the three Graziano fights and the Cerdan fight were named The Ring magazine Fight of the Year.

Zale was a 1991 inductee to the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF). In November 2015, his championship belts were stolen from the IBHOF. The belts were on loan from Zale&#x27;s family, and have yet to be returned.

Zale was originally cast to play himself in the movie &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;. According to director Robert Wise, Paul Newman (playing Graziano) was hesitant to fully engage Zale during rehearsal, fearing that Zale might reflexively knock him out if Newman inadvertently hit him too hard. As Newman had to appear aggressive against Zale in the film, Wise felt it was necessary to replace Zale with actor Courtland Shepard for the final fight scene.

<doc id="412128" wikidata="Q257948" url="?curid=412128" title="Frederick de Houtman">
<text>Frederick de Houtman ( – 21 October 1627) was a Dutch explorer, navigator, and colonial governor who sailed on the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies from 1595 until 1597, during which time he made observations of the southern celestial hemisphere and contributed to the creation of 12 new southern constellations.

== Career ==

=== East Indies ===
De Houtman was born in Gouda. De Houtman assisted fellow Dutch navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser with astronomical observations during the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies from 1595 until 1597. In 1598, de Houtman sailed on a second expedition led by his brother, Cornelis de Houtman, who was killed during the voyage. Frederick was imprisoned by the Sultan of Aceh, Alauddin Riayat Syah, in northern Sumatra.

He used his two years of captivity—from September 1599 until August 1601—to study the local Malay language and to make astronomical observations. These observations supplemented those made by Keyser on the first expedition. The constellations formed from their observations were first published in 1597 or 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius, and later globes incorporated adjustments based on De Houtman&#x27;s later observations.

Credit for these constellations is generally assigned jointly to Keyser, De Houtman, and Plancius, though some of the underlying stars were known beforehand. The constellations are also widely associated with Johann Bayer, who included them in his celestial atlas, &quot;Uranometria&quot;, in 1603. After De Houtman&#x27;s return to Europe, De Houtman published his stellar observations in an appendix to his dictionary and grammar of the Malayan and Malagasy languages.

=== Australia ===
In 1619 De Houtman sailed in the Dutch East India Company ship , along with Jacob Dedel in the . They sighted the Australian coast near present-day Perth, which they called Dedelsland. After sailing northwards along the coast he encountered and only narrowly avoided a group of shoals, subsequently called the Houtman Abrolhos.

De Houtman then made landfall in the region known as Eendrachtsland, which the explorer Dirk Hartog had encountered earlier. In his journal, De Houtman identified these coasts as Locach, mentioned by Marco Polo to have been a country far south of China and indicated as such on maps by cartographers Plancius and Linschoten.

<text>The Ellesmere Canal was a waterway in England and Wales that was planned to carry boat traffic between the rivers Mersey and Severn. The proposal would create a link between the Port of Liverpool and the mineral industries in north east Wales and the manufacturing centres in the West Midlands. However, the canal was never completed as intended because of its rising costs and failure to generate the expected commercial traffic.

The Ellesmere Canal, which was first proposed in 1791, would have created a waterway between Netherpool, Cheshire, and Shrewsbury. However, only certain sections were completed; these were eventually incorporated into the Chester Canal, Montgomery Canal and Shropshire Union Canal. Although several major civil engineering feats were accomplished, major building work ceased following the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805. The northern end of the navigation&#x27;s mainline ended from Chester at Trevor Basin near Ruabon and its southern end was at Weston Lullingfields about from Shrewsbury.

As part of the rebranding of Britain&#x27;s industrial waterways as leisure destinations, the surviving central section is now called the Llangollen Canal; even though historically its builders had no intention of sending boat traffic to Llangollen. The branch, from which the waterway now takes its name, was primarily a water feeder from the River Dee above the town. Therefore it was not built as a broad-gauge canal, hence its inherently narrow design.

==History==

===Route planning===
The formal proposal for the canal was launched at a meeting in Ellesmere in 1791 for a canal from Netherpool (now Ellesmere Port) on the River Mersey to the River Dee at Chester. It would then go in a south easterly direction via Overton (south of Wrexham) to the River Severn at Shrewsbury. Branches would then be cut to the iron making and coal mining areas at Bersham between Wrexham and Ruabon and to the copper mines at Llanymynech. By 1793 an act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 91), had been passed allowing the Ellesmere Canal company to build the canal.

However this route of the canal beyond Chester was not to the liking of all backers. They wanted the canal&#x27;s course to follow a more westerly route from the Dee to the Severn passing directly through the Welsh mining areas. Eventually this proposal was the one that canal engineer John Duncombe followed when he eventually surveyed the route. Notable civil engineer William Jessop was called into advise; he too recommended the route surveyed by Duncombe. Jessop was eventually appointed the project&#x27;s engineer while Thomas Telford was appointed as General Agent. The northernmost section, a contour canal, from the Mersey to the Dee was completed in 1797. This allowed the company to generate revenue from tolls to help finance construction of the rest of the canal.

However the westerly route posed formidable engineering obstacles. Close to the Eglwyseg and Ruabon mountains, there were deep river valleys to be crossed and high ground to be tunnelled. Duncombe&#x27;s survey involved a climb of from Chester to Wrexham, a tunnel at Ruabon, a high level crossing over the Dee at Pontcysyllte, a further tunnel and aqueduct near Chirk, and a tunnel in Shropshire near Weston Lullingfields.

A plan of the canal, published in 1795, showed the route between Netherpool in the north to Shrewsbury to the south: 
:River Mersey; Great Stanney; Stoak; Wervin; Caughall; Chester; Saltneyside; Lache Hall; Rough Hill; Cuckoos Nest; Wrexham; Ruabon; Plas Madoc; Chirk; Hordley; Dandyford; Shade Oak; Weston Lullingfields; Eyton; Walford; Hancott; Shrewsbury; River Severn.
The canal plan would also have four branches:
*A branch would run to Holt.
*A branch would run from near Wrexham to Brymbo.
*A branch would run from near Hordley to Llanymynech, via Maesbury, Morton and Crickheath.
*A branch would run from near Tetchill to Prees Heath, via Welshampton, Fenn&#x27;s Moss and Whitchurch.

Originally Jessop had suggested that the cheaper solution was to use locks on both sides of Vale of Llangollen to take the canal down to a more manageable height for the second, upstream crossing of the River Dee at Froncysyllte. Rather than crossing at full height, the locks would reuse water by backpumping. But by 1795 Jessop and Telford had changed their decision. Instead they developed a proposal for a cast-iron aqueduct to maintain the original level.

===Construction===

In 1796 the Llanymynech Branch was opened, linking the main line at Frankton Junction with Llanymynech. This joined the Montgomeryshire Canal at Carreghofa Locks when the Montgomeryshire opened in 1797.

In 1796, Thomas Telford constructed a feeder reservoir lake in Moss Valley, Wrexham to provide water to the length of canal between Trevor Basin and Chester. However, as the plan to build this section was cancelled in 1798, the isolated feeder and a stretch of navigation between Ffrwd and a basin in Summerhill was abandoned. Remnants of the feeder channel are visible in Gwersyllt. A street in the village is still named Heol Camlas (Canal Way).

The contour section from the River Mersey to the River Dee at Chester was joined to the Chester Canal in 1797.

On the main line section, the Chirk Aqueduct was opened in 1801, and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805. However, by this time the proposed line from the Dee at Chester to Ruabon had been abandoned as uneconomic. The canal was therefore terminated at Trevor Basin, southwest of Ruabon.

Also abandoned was the plan to reach the Severn, as the Shrewsbury Canal was already serving the town, and the poor navigational state of the Severn meant that additional traffic would not justify the cost of the building works.

As the canal would now not reach its proposed main source of water northwest of Wrexham, a feeder was constructed along the side of the Dee valley to Horseshoe Falls at Llantysilio. This narrow feeder branch was made navigable, allowing boats to reach Llangollen.

In the end the only parts of the main line of the canal to be built was the extreme northern line from the Mersey to Chester and the central section from Trevor Basin to Weston Lullingfields. As this left the middle part isolated from the rest of the UK waterways network, the planned Whitchurch branch was re-routed. A link was built from Frankton via Ellesmere to the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction in sections between 1797 and 1806. Despite the circuitous route, it was considered to be the main line. The extension also included an arm to Whitchurch because the town had been by-passed by the new route.
A branch was also originally intended to reach Prees in Shropshire; however the line was only constructed as far as Quina Brook, from the village.

The section of waterway from Frankton Junction to Weston Lullingfields, which was originally intended to be the main line to Shrewsbury, became the Weston Branch. The uncompleted part between Weston Lullingfields and the River Severn would have been long, with of lockage and a tunnel at Weston Lullingfileds.

===Working canal===

Due to the constraints placed on the canal by its incomplete design, the Ellesmere Canal struggled financially throughout its operating life as an industrial waterway. In 1813, the Ellesmere Canal company merged with the Chester Canal to form the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company under the Ellesmere and Chester Canals Unification Act 1813 (53 Geo. 3. c. lxxx). This business was then merged with the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal by the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. ii). A year later the canal was taken over again by the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company.

By 1917 the Weston Branch had closed following a breach near Hordley Wharf. In 1939 traffic on the line from Hurleston to Llangollen had all but ceased. All remaining parts of the Ellesmere Canal network, other than the northern line from Ellesmere Port to Chester, were closed to navigation by the London Midland and Scottish Railway (Canals) Act 1944 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 6. c. ii). However, the canal from Hurleston to Llangollen was retained as a water feeder for the Shropshire Union Canal main line and for drinking water. In 1955 an agreement with the Mid &amp; South East Cheshire Water Board secured the canal&#x27;s future.

===Present day===
Despite the formal closure, increasing popularity of the canal with pleasure boats led to its acceptance as an important amenity and rebranding as the Llangollen Canal. As the canal was never intended to go to Llangollen, this renaming is an ironic twist symbolic of the canal&#x27;s convoluted development.

The Ellesmere Canal south of Frankton Junction (the Llanymynech Branch), together with the Montgomeryshire Canal, today form the Montgomery Canal.

The isolated section from Chester to Ellesmere Port is considered part of the Shropshire Union Canal main line.

The Weston Branch is now infilled save for a very short section which has a Canal &amp; River Trust amenity block.

==Route==

===Ellesmere Port to Chester===

The canal starts at Ellesmere Port Dock by the Mersey. Originally goods would be transferred directly from inland waterways craft into river-going vessels at the dock, which would enter and exit through tidal lock gates. However, in the 1890s, with the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, the basin became detached from the river. Traffic was controlled by a set of two-lock staircases.

A contour canal runs between Ellesmere Port and Chester following the course of a natural river valley that encompasses Backford Brook and the Bache valley. The canal enters Chester Basin (wharf) at the junction with the Chester Canal. At this point, there is also a 4-lock branch that once led down to the River Dee and Port of Chester.

When the Ellesmere Canal reached the Chester Canal, the configuration of the staircase locks at Chester was altered. The original 5-lock staircase was replaced by a deeper three-lock arrangement. At this point, the section is now part of the Shropshire Union Canal.

===Hurleston to Frankton Junction===

This section was added to link the canal to the national network. It became the Ellesmere Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal and is now part of the Llangollen Canal.




===Frankton Junction to Trevor Basin===

This was the principal part of the original main line of the canal. It became the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal and is now part of the Llangollen Canal.

===Trevor Basin to Horseshoe Falls===

This section of the canal was added as a navigable feeder. It is now part of the Llangollen Canal.


===Frankton Junction to Llanymynech===

This section (the Llanymynech Branch) is now designated as part of the Montgomery Canal (which combines the branch and the Montgomeryshire Canal). The section from Frankton Junction to Lockgate Bridge (where the branch meets the Weston Arm) was originally intended to be the main line of the Ellesmere Canal.

Bridge numbering starts at Hurleston Junction, where the Llangollen Canal and the Shropshire Union Canal main line meet, and continues down the Llanymynech Branch despite the Llangollen and Montgomery Canal now being regarded as two separate canals.



===Lockgate Bridge to Weston Lullingfields===

This section was originally intended to be the main line of the canal and is now infilled. The arm had wharves at Hordley, Dandyford, Pedlar&#x27;s Bridge, Shade Oak and Weston Lullingfields. At Weston Lullingfields the canal company built a wharf, four lime kilns, a public house, stables, a clerk&#x27;s house and weighing machine. These were opened in 1797 and closed in 1917 when the Weston branch was closed following a breach of the canal.

<text>Tracy Dawn Scoggins (born November 13, 1953) is an American actress and model. She began her career in Elite Model Management in New York City and the European modeling circuit. She returned to the United States and studied acting at the Herbert Berghof Studio in the late 1970s. In early 1980s, Scoggins began appearing on television and film, notable playing main roles in the short-lived television series &quot;The Renegades&quot; (1983) and &quot;Hawaiian Heat&quot; (1984).

Scoggins starred as Monica Colby in the 1980s primetime soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1985, 1989) and its spin-off series &quot;The Colbys&quot; (1985–1987). She starred as Cat Grant in the first season of the ABC comedy-drama series, &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993–94), and as Captain Elizabeth Lochley during the final season of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; in 1998 and its sequels.

==Early life==
Scoggins was born in Galveston County, Texas. An only child, Scoggins is the daughter of John Scott Scoggins and Lou Cille ( Crump) Scoggins. Her father was a trial lawyer, and her mother graduated from law school and was a tennis champion. She attributes her own success to their influence.

At the age of nine, Scoggins won a diving championship; by 13, she was accumulating swimming medals. At Dickinson High School, where she graduated in 1970, Scoggins was an athlete, excelling in cheerleading, gymnastics, and diving. She enrolled at Southwest Texas State University in 1970. As a student-athlete there, she was on the varsity gymnastics team and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education. While at Southwest Texas State, Scoggins nearly qualified for a spot on the 1980 Olympic diving team.

==Career==

After graduation, Scoggins briefly taught physical education before being recruited by John Casablancas of the Elite Model Management agency. Elite sent Scoggins to New York, where she worked for a year before embarking on a European fashion modeling circuit that included Italy, Germany, and France.

Nearly two years after the cancellation of &quot;The Colbys&quot; after two seasons in 1987, Scoggins reprised the role of Monica Colby in the last eight episodes of the final season of &quot;Dynasty&quot; in 1989.

Scoggins made her professional big screen debut in the 1984 action film &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;, but played first leading role in the 1988 crime thriller film &quot;In Dangerous Company&quot;. She played another leading role in the 1990 action comedy &quot;The Gumshoe Kid&quot; alongside Jay Underwood and also that year starred in Michael Schultz-directed made-for-television comedy-satire &quot;Jury Duty: The Comedy&quot;. She starred in the horror films &quot;Watchers II&quot; (1990) and &quot;Demonic Toys&quot; (1992), as well detective film &quot;Dan Turner, Hollywood Detective&quot; (1990) and legal thriller &quot;Ultimate Desires&quot; (1991), both opposite Marc Singer. She co-starred opposite Michael Biehn in the science-fiction film &quot;Timebomb&quot; (1991), and &quot;Alien Intruder&quot; (1993).

She left the series after the first season. In 1994, Alan Spencer cast Scoggins in a pilot for CBS called &quot;Galaxy Beat&quot;. The pilot did not sell.

<doc id="412140" wikidata="Q1212173" url="?curid=412140" title="The Discovery of Heaven">
<text>The Discovery of Heaven () is a 1992 novel by Dutch writer Harry Mulisch. It is considered Mulisch&#x27;s masterpiece and was voted best book in the Dutch language in a 2007 poll among the readers of &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot;.

A 2001 film adaptation by director Jeroen Krabbé features Stephen Fry and Flora Montgomery in the leading roles.

==Plot summary==
In the book, an angel-like being is given the task of returning the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments to Heaven. However, he cannot directly travel to Earth, so he manipulates events to bring three people together who will conceive a child with an innate desire to fulfill the mission. The book is divided into four parts, each representing a different phase of the story.

In &quot;The Beginning of the Beginning,&quot; the angel reports to his superior that he has completed his mission after seventy years of planning. He orchestrates the birth of the messenger&#x27;s parents, Max Delius and Ada Brons, who meet in the aftermath of World War II. Max and Ada&#x27;s friend, Onno Quist, also plays a significant role in their lives. Max and Onno become close friends, engaging in intellectual conversations about various topics, including religion and philosophy. Ada falls in love with Max, but their relationship ends abruptly when Max leaves during a sexual encounter. Ada then develops a relationship with Onno.

In &quot;The End of the Beginning,&quot; Ada discovers she is pregnant, and Onno proposes to marry her, assuming the child is his. However, Max realizes he could be the father and decides to distance himself from Ada and Onno. Ada&#x27;s condition worsens after a car accident, and Max begins a secret affair with Ada&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Brons. Max suggests they raise the child together, and they move to an apartment near Westerbork. Ada gives birth to a child named Quinten.

&quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; focuses on Quinten&#x27;s upbringing. He is an introverted and intelligent child, fascinated by architecture and ancient keys. Onno&#x27;s political career crumbles, and he decides to disappear from society. Max leaves Mrs. Brons for another woman but continues to live with her and Quinten. Max is on the verge of a major astronomical discovery when he is killed by a meteoroid.

In &quot;The End of the End,&quot; Quinten, now sixteen, sets out to find his father. He travels to Italy and eventually meets Onno in Rome. They visit various sights and become fixated on the stone tablets stored in the Lateran. Quinten believes they hold significance in Christianity and Judaism. After studying ancient architecture and locksmithing, Quinten convinces Onno to steal the stone tablets. They discover the tablets in the Lateran&#x27;s chapel and travel to Jerusalem.

In Jerusalem, Onno encounters an elderly woman who may be Max&#x27;s mother and Quinten&#x27;s grandmother. Meanwhile, Quinten enters a hallucinative state and returns to the Dome of the Rock with the tablets. In this dream-like state, he ascends to heaven with the tablets, completing his mission.

In the end, the angel-like being is commended by the Archangel for his actions, but he feels remorse for severing the connection between heaven and Earth. However, he realizes the situation is beyond his control.

==Reception==

In a review of the German translation, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; called &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot; a masterpiece that successfully captured the plight of the post-War generation in Europe, that &quot;drags along its parents&#x27; crimes suffering for life&quot;. In the Netherlands, the novel&#x27;s publication led critics to compare Mulisch with Thomas Mann and Robert Musil; a review in &quot;Trouw&quot; called it the work of a virtuoso, &quot;amusing, yet also touching and exciting&quot;.

A 1997 &quot;New York Times&quot; review was less favorable, praising the book for its &quot;novelistic bravura&quot;, but criticizing the &quot;labyrinthine middle section&quot; that &quot;slows it nearly to a halt&quot;.

==Adaptation==
In 2001 the book was made into a movie of the same name by Jeroen Krabbé. Mulisch allowed his novel be adapted for film on condition that the English comedian Stephen Fry play Onno Quist. Krabbé did not follow the book closely and removed some of the longer pieces, especially the friendship between Max and Onno and the youth of Quinten. He changed some events for dramatic reasons.

<text>William Winter Hamilton (26 June 1917 – 23 January 2000) was a British politician who served as a Labour Member of Parliament for constituencies in Fife, Scotland for 37 years, between 1950 and 1987. He was known for his strong republican views.

==Background==
Born in Houghton-le-Spring, the son of a County Durham miner, Hamilton joined the Labour Party as a teenager in 1936. He was educated at Washington Grammar School and Sheffield University (BA, DipEd), and following graduation became a schoolteacher. After initially being a conscientious objector in World War II, he served as a captain with the Pioneer Corps in the Middle East.

==Parliamentary career==
Hamilton contested West Fife at the 1945 general election, but lost to Communist Willie Gallacher.

In 1950 he overturned that result, winning by over 13,000 votes. In 1974, after boundary changes, he became MP for Fife Central.

In 1986 Hamilton was replaced as Labour candidate in Fife Central by Henry McLeish, and stood in the ultra-safe Conservative seat of South Hams in Devon, South-West England, where he came third, polling just 8% of the vote and losing to Conservative candidate and sitting MP Anthony Steen.

==Republican views==
He sponsored the equal pay for equal work bill in the 1970s but is best remembered for his stridently republican views, which he set out in detail in his book &quot;My Queen and I&quot;. He branded the Queen &quot;a clockwork doll&quot;, Princess Margaret &quot;a floozy&quot;, Prince Charles &quot;a twerp&quot;, and remarked upon the birth of Princess Anne&#x27;s son &quot;“How charming, another one on the payroll.”. However, he admired the Queen Mother, declaring on her 80th birthday: &quot;I am glad to salute a remarkable old lady. May she live to be the pride of the family.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1944, Hamilton married Joan Callow (died 1968), with whom he had a daughter and a son. He married his second wife Margaret Cogle in 1982 and from his retirement in 1987 until his death the couple lived in Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire. Willie Hamilton died in Lincoln in 2000, aged 82.

<doc id="412143" wikidata="Q1545923" url="?curid=412143" title="Llangollen Canal">
<text>The Llangollen Canal () is a navigable canal crossing the border between England and Wales. The waterway links Llangollen in Denbighshire, north Wales, with Hurleston in south Cheshire, via the town of Ellesmere, Shropshire. The name, which was coined in the 1980s, is a modern designation for parts of the historic Ellesmere Canal and the Llangollen navigable feeder, both of which became part of the Shropshire Union Canals in 1846.

The Ellesmere Canal was proposed by industrialists at Ruabon and Brymbo, and two disconnected sections were built. The northern section ran from Ellesmere Port on the River Mersey to Chester, where it joined the Chester Canal, and opened in 1795. Work on the southern section began at Frankton, with a line southwards to Llanymynech, and subsequently, a second section was built westwards towards Trevor. This involved crossing the Afon Ceiriog and the River Dee, which was achieved by building two vast aqueducts, using iron troughs to contain the water. The Ceiriog was crossed at Chirk, and Chirk Aqueduct opened in 1801, to exploit local supplies of iron and coal. The canal then passed through Chirk Tunnel, and reached the southern end of Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1802, which was not completed until 1805. To join the two halves up, a heavily engineered route from Trevor Basin via Ruabon and Brymbo to the River Dee at Chester was planned, but very little of it was built. Instead, the present route from Frankton to Hurleston Junction on the Chester Canal was constructed, and opened in 1805. As the route never reached the water reservoir at Moss Valley, Wrexham (built in 1786), a navigable feeder was built to Llantisilio where the Horseshoe Falls weir was constructed on the River Dee to supply the canal.

As part of the Shropshire Union system, the canal from Hurleston to Llangollen thrived until the end of the First World War, after which it saw very little traffic. Navigation was formally abandoned under the terms of an act of Parliament obtained by the owners, the London Midland and Scottish Railway, in 1944, but the channel was retained as it still supplied water to the main line of the Shropshire Union, and subsequently to the Mid &amp; South East Cheshire Water Board. This arrangement was due to end in 1954, but as there was no alternative supply of water, the powers were extended. Early pioneering cruises of the waterway were made by Tom Rolt in 1947 and 1949, and despite it being officially closed, a number of boats started to use it. There was a growing campaign to reopen it, but it was still designated as one of the &#x27;waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation&#x27; under government papers published in 1955 and 1958. It was not until the passing of the Transport Act 1968 that the route was finally designated as a cruiseway, and its future was secured. As leisure use of the canals grew, the route was rebranded as &quot;The Llangollen Canal&quot; in the 1980s, and it has become one of the most popular routes for holidaymakers. Its importance in the history of the British canal system was recognised in 2009, when the stretch from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel to Horseshoe Falls including Pontcysyllte and Chirk aqueducts was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

== History ==

A grand plan for the Ellesmere Canal was first proposed in 1791 by a small group of industrialists who owned coal mines, iron mines and other works near Ruabon. They wanted to link their area to the River Mersey in the north and the River Severn to the south. The northward section would link up with the Chester Canal and hence the River Dee before continuing to the Mersey at Netherpool (now Ellesmere Port). The southerly section of the waterway would pass through Overton before heading towards Shrewsbury. There would be branches to Bersham and Brymbo, where there were ironworks, to Llanymynech, where limestone was being quarried, and it would run past Whitchurch to Prees. A rival group proposed a branch from the Chester Canal to reach Ruabon, via Whitchurch, with additional lines to Llanymynech and Shrewsbury. There was support for the plans of the first group, and work began, but twelve years later, the plans of the second group had largely been implemented.

John Duncombe, an engineer who was one of the original promoters, and Joseph Turner estimated that the main line to Netherpool and to Shrewsbury would cost £67,456, while the whole scheme, including the branches, would cost £171,098. The promoters then decided they needed an engineer with a track record to advise them, and engaged the services of William Jessop, to be assisted by Duncombe and William Turner. Jessop proposed a somewhat different route south of Chester. It was the time of Canal Mania, and when subscriptions were opened, 1,234 subscribers offered a total of £967,700, of which £245,500 was actually accepted. In February 1793, the two groups decided to work together, and a host of deviations and alterations were made to the plans, for which an act of Parliament, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 91) was obtained on 30 April 1793. A capital of £400,000 was authorised, with powers to raise an additional £100,000 if required, and Jessop was appointed as engineer, to be assisted by Duncombe, Thomas Denson and William Turner. On 30 October, Thomas Telford was also engaged.

Work began on the route southwards from Netherpool in November 1793, and packet boats started to run along it from 1 July 1795, although it was not quite finished. Three locks to connect it to the Mersey were completed in early 1796, and coal was first carried to Chester in February. The connection to the Chester Canal took a little longer, and was completed in January 1797. The company were keen to develop the trade in limestone from Llanymynech, and cutting of the canal southwards from Frankton began in early 1794. At the time, plans for the Montgomeryshire Canal were before Parliament, which would continue southwards from Carreghofa, just beyond Llanymynech. With four locks at Frankton, and another three at Aston, the line to Carreghofa was opened in autumn 1796, and a good trade in limestone northwards, and goods southwards to the Montgomeryshire Canal, developed.

Progress north-westwards from Frankton towards Trevor was hampered by the need to cross two rivers, the Afon Ceiriog at Chirk and the Dee at Pontcysyllte. Both would require tall aqueducts, but to save construction costs at Pontcysylle, plans were drawn up for three locks at each end, to reduce the height of the main arches by . However, on 14 July 1795 Jessop proposed that the aqueduct should be built above the Dee, and that the costs should be saved by using an iron trough. He also proposed a similar trough at Chirk, instead of an embankment at Pont-faen, writing that &quot;instead of an obstruction it would be a romantic feature in the view&quot;, and this was a major factor in persuading the landowner to allow it to be built at Chirk, rather than at Pont-faen. The foundation stone for Pontcysyllte was laid on 25 July 1795, although the committee did not formally approve the new plans until 10 August.

Again, the company was keen to get trade moving on the canal, and pressed on with the line from Chirk to Frankton. The Vron Ironworks were at Chirk, with coal mines nearby, and goods from Ruabon could also be brought there by road, until the canal was completed. Work started on the Chirk aqueduct in January 1796, and when finished, it was long with ten arches, each with a span of , carrying the canal above the Afon Ceiriog. It was constructed with a cast-iron bottom to the trough, but the sides were of masonry, an unusual choice given the decision to use a cast-iron trough at Pontcysyllte. The section from Chirk to Frankton included six locks and was completed in 1801. The section onwards through Chirk and Whitehouses tunnels, to reach the southern end of Pontcysyllte, opened in June 1802. The section over Pontcysyllte aqueduct and to Trevor opened in 1805.

In July 1795, the company hired contractors to start work on the branch from Hordley, near Frankton locks, to Westoncommon, which was completed in 1797. A wharf, public house, stables and other features were constructed near Westoncommon, and four lime kilns were built, to burn lime from Llanymynech using coal from Chirk. Plans for this branch to continue onwards to Shrewsbury were dropped, because lime from Weston would have to compete with that brought along the Shrewsbury Canal, and coal to supply the domestic market at Shrewsbury would not be available until Pontcysyllte aqueduct was completed. It did not appear that the route would be profitable, and this remained true when the plans were reconsidered subsequently.

===Joining the two halves===

Plans for joining the southern sections to the northern one were revisited by Telford in 1795, and after approval by Jessop, were authorised by act of Parliament, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Act 1796 (36 Geo. 3. c. 71). They involved a heavily engineered line from Trevor to Chester, via Ruabon to the Dee at Chester, with a branch to Coed Talon, which would serve the Brymbo ironworks near Ffrwd. Locks would lift the line by from Trevor basin to Plas Kynaston, after which it would run on the level to Poolmouth and the junction with the Coed Talon Branch. It would then descend through a long flight of locks, roughly following the line of the later Chester to Wrexham railway, to enter the Dee opposite the branch to the Chester Canal. A second branch would run from Pulford to Farndon and Holt. Just over of the Coed Talon branch was built, to a basin near Ffrwd, and although it was filled with water, it seems that it was never used, and was filled in again from 1809.

In early 1794, a shareholder and a local landowner took out a patent for a canal lift, and offered to build a trial one. If it proved successful, then the Ellesmere company would pay for it, and if not, the inventors would meet the costs. A site was chosen on the proposed line, and by May 1796, it was ready for trials to begin. John Rennie and Jessop examined it, but like several similar ideas of the time, it was not felt to be robust enough to withstand the rigours of daily use. The company eventually paid £200 to the inventors, one quarter of the actual costs. Jessop decided in 1800 that the route between Trevor and Chester should be abandoned, due to the changes in circumstances, and coal being available in Chester from a number of other locations.

The Chester Canal, which had not been a financial success, had hoped that links with the Ellesmere Canal would improve their prospects, but when the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Act 1796 had failed to mention any connection with the Chester Canal, they had taken action, and had cut off the water supply to the northern section from Chester to Ellesmere Port. When agreement was reached on a new line from Frankton Junction to Whitchurch, the water supply was reinstated, and work on the new line started in February 1797. The work was difficult, as it had to cross Whixall Moss, and a tunnel was required near Ellesmere. It also included a branch to Prees Higher Heath, but only of this was built, terminating at Quina Brook, where the company built some limekilns. By 1804, the main line had reached Tilstock Park, some short of Whitchurch. Further agreement had been reached in 1802 on a route from Tilstock Park to Hurleston Junction, on which work started immediately. It was completed on 25 March 1805.

In order to keep the system supplied with water, the Ellesmere Canal, Railway and Water Supply Act 1804 (44 Geo. 3. c. liv) had authorised the construction of a navigable feeder from the north end of Pontcysyllte aqueduct to Llangollen on onwards to Llantisilo, where the Horseshoe Falls weir would be constructed on the River Dee. Once this opened in 1808, the system was not short of water. The Ellesmere company attempted to buy out the Chester Canal in 1804, but the offer had been refused. In 1813, they agreed to an amalgamation, on terms much worse than those offered in 1804, and the two companies became one from 1 July 1813.

The network expanded with the opening of the Middlewich Branch on 1 September 1833, and the completion on the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal from Nantwich Basin to Autherley on 2 March 1835. In May 1845, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company obtained an act of Parliament, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. ii), to enable them to absorb the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. The name was changed to the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846, with powers to build a number of railways or convert their canals into railways, but this vision was short-lived, and they agreed to a lease with the London and North Western Railway in late 1846. An act of Parliament was obtained to authorise this in 1847, but was not formally enacted until 1857. This ended their aspirations to build railways, but they remained remarkably independent despite railway control. The Shropshire Union was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway in late 1922, which itself became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway soon afterwards.

===Decline===
After the takeover by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, regular maintenance was often not carried out, and gradually the canals silted up, so that boats could not operate with full loads. Traffic declined, and was significantly affected by a breach that occurred at the Perry Aqueduct, about to the south of Frankton locks, which effectively closed the Montgomeryshire Canal to all traffic. Traffic beyond Frankton to Llangollen had ceased in 1937, and the Frankton to Hurleston section was not used after 1939. The London Midland and Scottish Railway obtained an act of Parliament sanctioning abandonment in 1944, allowing it to close of canals, including much of the Shropshire Union system. However, the line from Hurleston to Llangollen and onwards to Llantisilio was saved, as it was the main supply of water to the rest of the system.

On 6 September 1945, due to inadequate maintenance, the canal breached its banks east of Llangollen near Sun Bank Halt. The flow of hundreds of tons of water washed away the embankment of the railway further down the hill, creating a crater which was long and deep. This caused the first traffic of the morning, a mail and goods train composed of 16 carriages and two vans, to crash into the breach, killing one and injuring two engine crew. Despite the canal being officially closed, the breach was repaired, so that water could continue to reach the main line at Hurleston. The use of the canal as a water supply channel was further bolstered by an agreement with what became the Mid &amp; South East Cheshire Water Board, who used it to supply water to their Hurleston reservoir, and agreed to maintain it.

== Restoration ==
Although there had been little traffic since the end of the First World War, the channel had remained watered, because it supplied the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal. In the period after the Second World War, there was growing interest in using the canals for leisure cruising, and the pioneer Tom Rolt attempted to cruise the canal in 1947. Rolt&#x27;s boat was &quot;Cressy&quot;, which had been converted at Frankton to steam power, and on which Rolt had sailed westwards from Frankton Junction with Kyrle Willans after its conversion in 1930. At that time they had failed to reach Pontcysyllte. On this occasion, he was joined by a small cruiser named &quot;Heron&quot;, crewed by the Grundy family from Liverpool. The state of the canal was poor, and several of the locks were disintegrating, but despite low water levels and thick weed growth, both boats eventually reached Ellesmere. They then found that the water supply had been cut off due to a broken culvert near Chirk. After several weeks of being stranded, Rolt talked to the Chester office, and they arranged for water to be let down the canal, to enable the boats to return to Hurleston. On a second attempt two years later, Rolt and his wife reached Pontcysyllte, which they crossed accompanied by the actor Hugh Griffith and his wife Gunde. The Rolts moored for nearly three months just beyond the aqueduct, near the site where their boat had been built during the First World War. In August they were joined by Geoffrey Calvert and his family, who were attempting to reach the top of the canal in a home-made boat, &quot;Wagtail&quot;, which was pulled by a donkey. The Rolts travelled with them for part of the journey. Edward Wilson, another canal enthusiast, reached Trevor in his boat in 1952, and the Inland Waterways Association held a rally at Llangollen later that year.

By 1954, the Llangollen Canal was in a curious position. Under the terms of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (Canals) Act 1944 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 6. c. ii), navigation had been abandoned, but the right to sell water had been retained. This was to be for a period of ten years, during which those who bought the water were required to make alternative arrangements, which they failed to do. Since the nationalisation of the canals in 1948, the canal had been managed by the British Transport Commission, who had to obtain parliamentary approval to extend this arrangement. Meanwhile, a number of pleasure boats had ventured onto the canal, and there was a growing campaign to reopen the canal for navigation. A committee to spearhead this had been formed, and was chaired by the clerk for Wrexham Rural District Council, Trevor Williams. More than thirty other organisations were supporting the move, including the British Travel and Holidays Association.

In 1955, the Board of Survey, a committee chaired by Lord Rusholme, had produced a report on the future of the canals under the control of the British Transport Commission, which they had divided into three categories. There were of &#x27;waterways to be developed&#x27;, another of &#x27;waterways to be retained&#x27;, and finally of &#x27;waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation&#x27;. The Llangollen Canal was placed in the latter category, since it was still officially disused. This was followed in 1958 by the Bowes Report, which suggested that the first two categories should be classified as Class A and Class B waterways, with Class B waterways put back into good working order and retained for 25 years, to attract private investment. The Llangollen Canal was still in the final category, but the report at least suggested that there should be a right of appeal against closure, and gave the first hints that such canals could be retained because of their social value for recreation.

Hugh McKnight, the editor of the Inland Waterways Association&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin&quot;, wrote an optimistic report in 1966, pointing to the achievements of the first 20 years of the organisation&#x27;s existence, mentioning the changes in public opinion concerning the canals, and pointing particularly to the growth in leisure use on the Llangollen Canal and the Oxford Canal. Official attitudes changed, and the provisions of the Transport Act 1968 placed the canals under the control of the British Waterways Board, who were tasked with maintaining, developing and running them for the benefit of users. The whole of the branch from Hurleston Junction to Llantisilio, just below Horseshoe Falls, was listed in the act of Parliament as a cruising waterway, meaning that its future was no longer in jeopardy. As use by leisure craft grew, the &quot;Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union&quot; became popular due to its aqueducts and scenery. The canal was later renamed the Llangollen Canal, becoming one of the most popular canals for holidaymakers in Britain. The name is now used for the entire route from Hurleston to Llangollen, even though it was never described in this way during its commercial life. It is not entirely clear when the name was first applied, since it was listed as the &quot;Welsh Canal&quot;, a branch of the Shropshire Union, in 1985. At that time, potential boaters were advised that the canal was a water supply channel, and that they should submit an application containing full details and dimensions of their boat if they wanted to cruise on it. Nevertheless, they were instructed that British Waterways were keen to see leisure use of the canal, and that it could be quite congested in the summer season. Its origins as parts of two separate canals can be seen from the fact that the bridges are numbered from 1 at Hurleston to 70 at Rowsons Bridge, just past Frankton Junction. Continuing along the route to Llangollen, bridge numbering restarts at 1, while bridges 71 and upwards continue along what is now the Montgomery Canal, but was formerly the Ellesmere Branch to Llanymynech, where it joined the Montgomeryshire Canal.

A notable feature of the canal is the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, built by Thomas Telford. Opened in 1805, the aqueduct is more than long and above the valley floor. It has 19 stone arches, each with a 45-foot (14 metre) span. Another aqueduct carries the canal over the River Ceiriog at Chirk, and there are tunnels nearby at Whitehouses, Chirk, and Ellesmere.

The canal also forms the boundary on two sides of the Fenn&#x27;s, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve. In 2009 an section of the canal from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel through to the Horseshoe Falls, which includes Chirk Aqueduct and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

== Route ==
=== Hurleston to Frankton Junction ===
The canal at Hurleston Junction rises from the Shropshire Union Canal main line, through four adjacent locks, with a total rise of . The canal had been an early pioneer in the use of iron lock gates, instead of the more traditional wooden ones, and this material was first used on the locks at Frankton in 1819. The four locks here have a mixture of wooden and metal gates. All were built by the engineer J Fletcher around 1805. Lock 1 has metal lower gates, and a wooden upper gate, while gates at both ends of lock 2 are made of metal. The metal gates on both locks were replaced in 1974. Locks 3 and 4 have a single metal gate at the upper end, and wooden mitre gates at the lower end. Like many of the structures on the canal, they are grade II listed structures.

Beside the locks is Hurleston Reservoir, which has a capacity of . It is supplied with water that flows down the canal from Horseshoe Falls at Llantisilio, and is used both for drinking water and to supply the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal.
Water enters it through a side channel with sluices and a weir, just above lock number 4. The treatment works on the west bank is now operated by United Utilities, and was given a £6 million upgrade in 2003.

Just beyond the A534 Wrexham Road bridge is the entrance to Swanley Bridge Marina, on the west bank of the canal. It has moorings for over 300 boats, and is situated in of farmland, which includes a wood with nature trails. It opened in September 2006, and was built in response to a document published by British Waterways in the spring of that year, which outlined development opportunities for farmers and landowners adjacent to the canal.

The two Swanley locks raise the level of the canal by another , and by the upper lock is the grade II listed Swanley Hall, a red-brick farmhouse parts of which date from the early 16th century. Baddiley Hall, which has three storeys and an attic, and dates from the late 17th century, is set some distance back from the canal. In its grounds is the grade I listed parish church of St. Michael, the chancel of which dates from 1308, while the nave dates from 1811. Both are separated from the canal by a scheduled monument site, containing the earthworks and buried remains of an abandoned medieval village. The three Baddiley locks follow, with a combined rise of .

After passing Wrenbury Hall, on the west bank, the canal turns to the west, and is crossed by the Wrenbury Church lift bridge, the first of three lift-bridges in the village. It is formed of timber planks fixed between wooden beams, and the bridge deck is hinged at the northern end. A weighted counterbalance allows the bridge to be opened, and the structure is grade II* listed. Wrenbury lift bridge, No. 20, is automated, with push-button controls. It is operated by use of a British Waterways key, and involves closing barriers and stopping traffic on a sometimes-busy road. Wrenbury Wharf is next to the bridge, where the former mill building has been reused by a boatyard, and a nearby warehouse has become a pub.

At Grindley Brook, the canal was crossed by the defunct Whitchurch and Tattenhall Railway. The railway and the nearby Grindley Brook Halt railway station closed in 1957, and goods traffic ceased in 1963, but the massive embankments and bridge remain. Immediately afterwards, the canal passes through three locks and a three-chamber staircase lock, attended during summer months by a lock keeper. The six locks raise the level of the canal by . After another mile (1.6 km), there is a lift bridge just before the entrance to the Whitchurch Arm, which served the town of Whitchurch. Part of it remains open, and is used for moorings. The section from the main line to Sherryman&#x27;s Bridge was opened on 6 July 1808, and in 1811 a further extension into the town reached Castle Well. The arm remained closed when the canal reopened in the 1950s, but Whitchurch Town Council looked at ways of bringing boats back into the town in the early 1980s and the embryonic Whitchurch Waterway Trust was formed in 1986, with the aim of reopening the arm, of which around was left, the rest having been built over in the 1950s. This was achieved in October 1993, and the trust are hopeful that a new route into the town can be constructed.

Between bridges 42 and 47, the canal skirts the eastern edge and then passes through and the southern edge of Whixall Moss, part of the Fenn&#x27;s, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses National Nature Reserve. With a combined area of nearly , they form the third largest area of raised peat bog in the United Kingdom. The reserve is also a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, a European Special Area of Conservation and a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. The bogs were drained using powers enshrined in Enclosure Acts dating from 1777 and 1823, and further drainage took place when the canal was built in 1804, and again in 1863 when a railway was built along the north-western margins. Commercial peat cutting using mechanised cutters began in 1968, but extraction ceased in 1990.

The technical difficulties of cutting a canal through Whixall Moss were many, but Jessop and Telford decided on a direct route across the moss, rather than building a bypass that skirted round the edge of the area. The water table in the Moss was lowered by drainage and a raft was constructed, on which the canal was built. The canal had to float across the peat, and the engineers understood that regular maintenance of this section would be a requirement for many years. They employed a team of navvies to build up the banks with more clay on a continuous basis, who became known as the Whixall Moss Gang. Clay was obtained from the clay pit which became Whixall Marina, and was transferred to the work site in horse-drawn barges. Men were employed on this work from 1804 until 1960, working five and a half days a week, and became the longest serving group of navvies ever to work on the British canals. In the 1960s, the engineering issues that created the work were solved, and they were all laid off. The solution adopted to prevent the canal sinking further into the peat was to underpin the whole section with steel piling.

Adjacent to bridge 46 is Whixall Moss Junction leading to the Prees Branch. Two breaches of the canal have occurred near Whixall in recent years. The first was in 2004 at Hampton Bank, near bridge 50, when badgers burrowed into the bank, causing it to fail. The animals were also implicated in a breach some to the east of Cornhill Bridge 47, which occurred in late 2009. The bank failed as new piling was being driven in, but had previously been weakened by burrowing.

As the canal approaches Ellesmere, it passes a series of meres. Cole Mere is very close to the south bank of the canal, but at a lower level. Blake Mere is on the towpath side, with only the towpath separating it from the canal in places. Both are surrounded by woods, and the canal is fringed by oak trees, many planted by the Shropshire Union Company to ensure that they had supplies of timber to replace their fleet of wooden boats as that became necessary. At the far end of Blake Mere is the short Ellesmere Tunnel, just long, and beyond that the market town of Ellesmere. A short branch leads into the town, at the end of which is a three-storey, red brick warehouse, dating from the early 19th century, which is grade II listed. At the junction is a Canal and River Trust maintenance depot, housed in a series of buildings which are all grade II* listed. The complex includes Beech House, the offices of the Ellesmere Canal Company from 1806, but now converted into flats. The range of buildings form the best-preserved canal maintenance yard in Britain. The former stables and stores, which are now used as offices, include an exceptionally early example of a covered dry dock, in which barges were built and repaired. It predates the better known examples of covered slips at the naval dockyards of Devonport and Chatham.

The canal also passes through Burland, Quoisley Bridge, and Bettisfield.

===Prees Branch=== 

The Prees Arm of the canal was originally intended to reach Prees, but only the first were constructed, terminating at Quina Brook. Much of the ground through which it passed is formed of peat. Today it is only open for 7 furlongs (1.4 km), with two lift bridges, to a marina at the end of the navigable part; beyond that, another , as far as Waterloo Bridge, is partially watered and forms the Prees Branch Canal Nature Reserve. The remaining is dry, but can be followed in the landscape as most of it is marked by trees growing along its course. The towpath is on the eastern bank from the junction to Dobson&#x27;s Bridge, and then crosses over to the other side, where it remained to the end of the canal at Quina Brook.

Next to the junction is a toll-keeper&#x27;s cottage dating from around 1800, the time of the construction of the canal. It has since been reused as a farmhouse. Allman&#x27;s Bridge dates from the construction of the canal, although there have been some later repairs to the structure. The wooden decking is opened by a counterweight and chains. It was one of the last manual lift bridges to be converted to hydraulic operation in 2010. Nearby is a single arched squinch bridge, again dating from the early 1800s and constructed in red bricks. It crosses a drainage ditch, probably associated with the drainage of Whixall Moss, which passes under the canal at this point. Starks Bridge is another wooden lift bridge, and as well as being grade II* listed, is a scheduled ancient monument. It is a rare example of a skewed lift bridge. Dobson&#x27;s Bridge, a fixed humpback bridge made of red bricks with an elliptical arch, was classified in 1987 as a Grade Il listed building.

At the end of the navigable section is Whixall Marina, which was constructed on the site of some clay pits, which for many years supplied clay used for puddling of the canals. From 2017 to 2018, the marina had been refurbished with the addition of a waterside cafe, car park and new shower and toilet facilities. It is also near the famous Whixall Moss which is used by many walkers. On the nature reserve section, Boodles Bridge is of similar construction and date to Dobson&#x27;s Bridge. At the far end of the canal are the remains of two groups of limekilns, the main group consisting of four kilns built of red brick and sandstone rubble. They were built at the same time as the branch was constructed.

=== Frankton Junction to Trevor Basin ===

At Frankton Junction the Montgomery Canal, which is partially restored, heads southwards. For historic reasons the bridge numbering continues down the Montgomery Canal and a second bridge numbering series for the Llangollen Canal begins with Rowson&#x27;s Bridge (which is numbered both 1W and 70). The &quot;W&quot; addition was part of a Minimum Safety Standards scheme instigated by British Waterways, to avoid possible confusion, especially for emergency services, of having different bridges on the same canal with the same number. British Waterways consulted with the Inland Waterways Association and the Shropshire Union Canal Society before finally deciding to add the &quot;W&quot;, and at the same time as the numbers were altered, it ensured that all bridges carried a number on both sides. The work was due to be completed by July 2008, but there were delays due to manufacturing difficulties with the new castings.

The Llangollen Canal passes through Hindford, Saint Martin&#x27;s, Preesgweene, Chirk Bank, Chirk and Froncysyllte, and includes the Chirk Aqueduct, the Chirk Tunnel and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.


=== Trevor Basin to Horseshoe Falls ===

This section was built as a navigable feeder and is both shallow and narrow. Some sections near Llangollen are too narrow for boats to pass each other and it is necessary to scout ahead to check for oncoming boats. Navigation should not be attempted by boats with a draught of more than . A number of breaches had occurred on this final section over many years, and in the early 1980s, British Waterways initiated a programme to resolve this issue. Parts of it were rebuilt with a concrete lining, which included a waterproof membrane to retain the water, and a system of drainage pipes underneath the bed, to prevent water building up and damaging the construction.

Navigation by powered craft is prohibited beyond the entrance to Llangollen Marina and the final section is used only by horse drawn trip boats. The current boats maintain a long tradition, which was first offered to visitors in 1884. The towpath beside the feeder is in good condition, and walkers can reach the weir at Horseshoe Falls. British Waterways maintains a gravel shoal immediately upstream of the marina entrance past Llangollen Wharf. This maintains a draught which most narrowboats cannot pass, but which is passable by the shallow draughted trip boats.

In 2005, a marina was constructed by British Waterways, just upstream from Llangollen Wharf, to relieve the acute shortage of casual moorings, and provides 33 berths. About downstream of the wharf there are about a dozen visitor moorings complete with individual electricity and water pedestals at each. Similar pedestals have also been installed at the marina berths. Mooring in Llangollen is restricted to 48 hours, and a charge is made both at the marina and the visitor moorings, which are below bridge 45.

<doc id="412144" wikidata="Q1274510" url="?curid=412144" title="For a Lost Soldier">
<text>For a Lost Soldier () is a 1992 Dutch coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Roeland Kerbosch, based on the autobiographical novel of the same title by ballet dancer and choreographer Rudi van Dantzig. It is centered around an adult Canadian soldier (Andrew Kelley) who meets a young Dutch boy (Maarten Smit) in rural 1945 Holland. They experience a romantic and sexual relationship during the liberation of the Netherlands from Nazi occupation.

==Plot==
In the 1980s, middle-aged ballet dancer and choreographer Jeroen feels dissatisfied with his dancers&#x27; interpretation of an autobiographical ballet about Canada&#x27;s liberation of the Netherlands in 1945. In his office, he shows his colleague Laura a photo of himself as a 12-year-old with his foster family during WWII. A document and vintage sunglasses on his desk reveal he is searching for a Canadian soldier named Walt. Jeroen decides to visit the village where he lived with his foster family, bringing the sunglasses and engaging in mental “conversations” with his teenage self. During the first, the story shifts to 1944.

At 11, Jeroen is sent to a foster family in the countryside to escape hunger. Despite a mix-up—they wanted a girl—they treat him kindly. On his first night, he wets the bed while sharing it with Henk, his foster parents&#x27; slightly older son, and begins to realize he is gay. When a Canadian warplane crashes near the village beach, Jeroen becomes fascinated. He and his bisexual friend Jan try to explore the wreck but fail.

When Canadian liberators arrive, Jeroen meets Walt, a soldier, and they begin flirting. At a party, they secretly dance, and Jeroen is smitten. Later, they meet again, and Jeroen accompanies Walt to the soldiers&#x27; hotel. They join others at the beach, but when the group leaves, Jeroen shows Walt the crashed plane. They return to the hotel to retrieve a jeep, but Walt’s comrades have disabled it. Walt sneaks inside to fix it and showers before rejoining Jeroen, who waits outside. Jeroen enters Walt’s room, and they have sex.

The next Sunday, Jeroen confidently fends off another assault attempt by Jan. He and Walt meet at a church service, explore the plane wreck, and Walt gives Jeroen a driving lesson. While Walt sleeps after they have sex again, Jeroen takes one of his photos and hides it in his shirt. Later, Walt waits in Jeroen&#x27;s foster family&#x27;s garden to take a photo. Disappointed Walt cannot be in it, Jeroen uses a scarecrow as his “double” by placing Walt&#x27;s identification tag around its neck. Walt&#x27;s comrades arrive and suggest a group photo with Jeroen&#x27;s foster family. While developing the photos, Jeroen ruins the negative. He comforts Walt, promising they will always be together, unaware Walt is leaving the next day. That night, Walt tries to ask Jeroen&#x27;s foster father, Hait, to explain his departure, but Hait does not understand.

The next day, Jeroen overhears his older foster sister discussing the soldiers&#x27; departure. Devastated, he pushes his younger foster sister off her bike and searches for Walt. Returning home, he sees his older foster sister hanging laundry, including the shirt with Walt’s ruined photo. Heartbroken, Jeroen is woken by a storm and mistakes the scarecrow for wearing Walt&#x27;s tag. Running outside, he impales his hand on barbed wire. Hait finds him and burns the scarecrow the next morning, discovering Walt&#x27;s forgotten sunglasses. Later, Jeroen receives a letter from his mother, not Walt, and breaks down by the sea. When his mother comes to take Jeroen back home, Hait comforts him and secretly places Walt&#x27;s camera films in Jeroen&#x27;s suitcase, giving the sunglasses to Jeroen&#x27;s mother to pass on later. As they leave, Hait asks Jeroen to send him a photo of them together. Jeroen recalls his teenage heartbreak and mentally tells his younger self that he does not remember Hait&#x27;s words, but his teenage self admits he heard them and chose to forget.

Back in the 1980s, a content Jeroen encourages his dancers during their final rehearsal. As he watches them perform, Laura hands him an envelope containing an enlarged photo of himself and his foster family. Beneath it is a zoomed image of Walt&#x27;s identification tag, revealing his contact information.

==Cast==
==Reception==
Despite its controversial themes, Kerbosch said that the film was broadly accepted. &quot;In Holland, audiences just took it as a love story,&quot; he said. &quot;And that&#x27;s also what happened in New York, because it&#x27;s a love story, a beautiful and romantic one at that.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;refusal to load the story with contemporary psychological and social baggage&quot; but wrote that the film was unable to achieve a &quot;coherent dramatic frame&quot;. He added that the film does not insinuate Walt was responsible for harming Jeroen or had abused Jeroen, and also that within the work &quot;is no mention of homosexuality.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that due to a lack of clarity over the homosexual themes, the film &quot;delves into issues far too serious and controversial for such questions to go unanswered.&quot; He also stated that the confusion over language, as the film is partially in English and partially in Dutch, may have caused it to &quot;lack crucial clarity,&quot; despite good acting.

While Desmond Ryan of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called the film &quot;an acutely observed portrait of adolescent yearning&quot;, he criticized the film&#x27;s opaque ending, saying, &quot;What was evenhanded becomes simply open-ended.&quot;

The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), a pedophilia advocacy organization, praised the film, focusing on the relationship between the adult and child. &quot;We see man and boy kissing, stripping naked, showering, climbing under the covers. There is one long, lovingly photographed close-up of the boy&#x27;s face as the soldier, lying upon him, penetrates him anally. All of this is handled in perfect taste, of necessity with a minimum of words, since the boy speaks little English and the soldier no Dutch.&quot; NAMBLA used the film to justify pedophilic relationships, comparing the fight against child abuse and pedophilia to the persecution of &quot;Jew[s], Gypsy[s], and homosexual[s].&quot;

<text>Timothy Vincent Johnson (July 23, 1946 – May 9, 2022) was an American politician and lawyer from Illinois. He was the U.S. representative for , serving from 2001 to 2013. He was a member of the Republican Party and did not run for re-election in 2012.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Johnson was born in Champaign to Robert and Margaret Evans Johnson, and spent his childhood in Urbana, where he graduated from Urbana High School.

He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1964, followed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Johnson majored in history and graduated in 1969 Phi Beta Kappa, receiving the Bronze tablet, an honor given to the top 3% of undergraduates. In 1972, Johnson graduated with honors from the University of Illinois College of Law and was elected to the Order of the Coif, a national legal honor society.
In 1971, Johnson was elected to the city council of Urbana, Illinois.

==Illinois House of Representatives==

In 1976, Johnson was elected to serve as a representative in Springfield, after besting five other Republican candidates in the 1976 Republican primary. Johnson remained a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1976 to 2000.

While running for re-election in 1980, a photograph was published showing Johnson had rigged a paper clip on the voting panel at his desk in the legislative chamber, pressing down the &quot;yes&quot; button so an affirmative vote could be recorded, even if he was not in the chamber. He initially denied installing it, but later said it was &quot;accepted practice&quot; in the legislature. Twenty years later, when Johnson ran for U.S. Congress, Mike Kelleher, his Democratic rival, had the story documented on a website dedicated to the photograph and Johnson&#x27;s reactions, saying &quot;It would be funny, if it weren&#x27;t so serious...&quot;

For most of his career, Johnson represented much of the more rural and conservative portion of Champaign County, along with portions of Ford and Douglas counties. After the 1990 census, Johnson was drawn into the same district as Democrat Helen F. Satterthwaite, who had long represented the other side of Urbana, as well as the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, the new district was more Johnson&#x27;s territory than Satterthwaite&#x27;s; Republicans outnumbered Democrats by almost 3 to 1. It also did not include Satterthwaite&#x27;s old base at the U of I. At that election, Johnson won with 60 percent of the vote.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

;2004
In 2004, Johnson raised $533,478 in campaign funds, less than half the national average for a Republican running for reelection ($1,206,138). The 2004 campaign fundraising was about a quarter of the $1,943,630 raised by his initial campaign in 2000; that in turn was nearly double the amount raised by his fellow freshmen Republicans ($1,171,118). Johnson defeated Democratic candidate David Gill 61% to 39% .

;2006
In his 2000 campaign, Johnson pledged not to serve more than three terms. However, he ran for re-election in 2008 and 2010. Johnson &quot;underestimated the value of seniority,&quot; spokesman Phil Bloomer says of his boss&#x27; decision to run for a fifth term. &quot;As a rookie going in, (he) didn&#x27;t understand what he could accomplish for his district by being there a longer period.&quot;

In the 2006 election in November, Johnson again faced Democrat David Gill.

At the end of June 2006, Johnson had over $130,000 available for spending for his 2006 campaign, more than double the total amount raised by his opponent at that point. In the 2006 midterm elections, he was reelected by a slightly narrower 58-42% margin.

;2008

Johnson received 64.19% of his district&#x27;s votes, defeating Democratic nominee Steve Cox.

;2010

Johnson defeated Democratic nominee David Gill.

;2012
Due to congressional apportionment following the 2010 Census, Johnson&#x27;s district was renumbered as the for the 2012 elections. The redrawn district stretched from Champaign-Urbana through Springfield and Bloomington to the outer suburbs of St. Louis. Johnson now found himself in a district that was mostly new to him; he only retained about 30 percent of his former territory.

On March 14, 2012, Johnson endorsed Texas Congressman Ron Paul in the 2012 Republican Presidential primary in Illinois.

On April 5, 2012, just days after winning the Republican nomination for the reconfigured 13th, Johnson announced his retirement from office, to the surprise of many.

===Tenure===
Outside of meetings, committee hearings, and votes, Johnson was said to spend &quot;nearly every waking minute&quot; cold-calling his constituents; the practice amounted to calls to &quot;more than a half-million constituents&quot; during his first six terms in office.

In the House, Johnson&#x27;s voting record was the most moderate among Illinois Republicans outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. In 2010, American Conservative Union gave him its second-lowest rating among Illinois Republicans, behind only Mark Steven Kirk of the 10th District. However, he was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee.

For each of the 107th, 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses Johnson received a score of 0% from the Human Rights Campaign. This was for, among other things, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have prohibited discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation, and for refusing to adopt a written policy for his own office pledging not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in employment decisions.
Meanwhile, the Family Research Council, a conservative watchdog, in its most recent scorecard gives Johnson a 100%.

*Johnson voted against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which passed but was vetoed by President George W. Bush.
*In June 2006, Johnson voted against net neutrality, by voting for the COPE Act, and against the Markey amendment that would have inserted provisions to preserve network neutrality.
*Johnson was the sole Republican congressman to vote against the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 including immunity for American telecommunications companies that implemented warrantless wiretaps outside of the scope of the FISA program for the Bush administration. The bill passed, 293-129.
*On November 7, 2009, Johnson was the only Republican voting against the Republican Health Care Reform plan, the Boehner amendment to the Affordable Health Care for America Act.
*On February 8, 2011, Johnson was one of 26 Republicans who voted against extending the PATRIOT Act.

==Post congressional career==
In 2015, Johnson was elected to the Parkland College Board of Trustees.

In 2015, Johnson petitioned to become a delegate for Senator Marco Rubio&#x27;s Presidential campaign.

==Personal life==
Johnson had nine children. He died at his home in Urbana, Illinois, on May 9, 2022, aged 75.

<doc id="412149" wikidata="Q1268123" url="?curid=412149" title="Duyfken">
<text>Duyfken (; ), also in the form Duifje or spelled Duifken or Duijfken, was a small ship built in the Dutch Republic. She was a fast, lightly armed ship probably intended for shallow water, small valuable cargoes, bringing messages, sending provisions, or privateering. The tonnage of &quot;Duyfken&quot; has been given as 25–30 lasten ().

In 1606, during a voyage of discovery from Bantam (Banten), Java, captained by Willem Janszoon, she encountered the Australian mainland. Janszoon is credited with the first authenticated European landing on Australia. In 1608, the ship was damaged beyond repair.

A reproduction of &quot;Duyfken&quot; was built in Australia and launched in 1999.

==Voyages==
In 1595, a ship named &quot;Duyfken&quot; sailed in the first expedition to Bantam. After returning in August 1597, this ship was renamed &quot;Overijsel&quot; and also sailed in the second and fourth expedition to the East Indies.

On 23 April 1601, another ship named &quot;Duyfken&quot; sailed from Texel as &quot;jacht&quot;, or scout, under skipper Willem Cornelisz Schouten to the Spice Islands. After reaching Bantam, the &quot;Moluccan Fleet&quot;, consisting of five ships including &quot;Duyfken&quot; under admiral Wolphert Harmensz, encountered a blockading fleet of Portuguese ships totalling eight galleons and twenty-two galleys. They engaged this fleet in intermittent battle (the Battle of Bantam), driving them away on New Year&#x27;s Day 1602. Thus, the undisputed dominance of the Iberians (Portuguese and Spanish) in the spice trade to Europe was ended.

The fleet received a warm welcome in Bantam, repairs were carried out to damage caused in the battle, and a survey of Jakarta Bay was undertaken, where the Dutch would later build Batavia, their capital in the Indies. Then, sailing by way of Tuban, East Java to the Spice Island of Ternate, cloves were loaded on board and the ship returned to Banda for a cargo of nutmeg.
&quot;Duyfken&quot; was then sent on a voyage of exploration to the east when the newly formed Dutch East India Company (, commonly abbreviated to VOC) was granted a monopoly on trade to the Spice Islands by the Dutch government. On the voyage home from the Indies &quot;Duyfken&quot; was separated from the larger ships in a storm off Cape Agulhas, southern Africa and reached Flushing in April 1603, two months ahead of the larger ships.

On 18 December 1603, &quot;Duyfken&quot;, with Willem Janszoon as skipper, set out on a second voyage to the Indies in the VOC fleet of Steven van der Haghen. The VOC fleet captured a Portuguese ship in Mozambique Channel and sailed to the Spice Islands via Goa, Calicut, Pegu and finally reaching Bantam, Java on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1604.

In 1605, &quot;Duyfken&quot; was in the fleet that recaptured the fort of Van Verre at Ambon in the Spice Islands, from the Portuguese. She was then sent to Bantam, Java for urgently needed provisions.

In 1605, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) sent &quot;Duyfken&quot;, captained by Willem Janszoon, to search for trade opportunities in the &quot;south and east lands&quot; beyond the furthest reaches of their known world. Willem Janszoon took the ship southeast from Banda to the Kei Islands, then along the south coast of New Guinea, skirting south of the shallow waters around False Cape (Irian Jaya) and then continuing east-southeast.

In early 1606, Janszoon encountered and then charted the shores of Australia&#x27;s Cape York Peninsula. The ship made landfall at the Pennefather River in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This is the first authenticated sighting of Australia by Europeans, and also the first authenticated landing of Europeans on Australian soil. For the first time all the inhabited continents of the world were known to the European science of geography. The ship sailed back to Bantam.

In 1607, &quot;Duyfken&quot; may have made a second voyage east to Australia. Later in the year, she was sent to Java to get supplies for the beleaguered Dutch fortress on Ternate. In February or March 1608, &quot;Duyfken&quot; was involved in hunting Chinese junks north of Ternate.

In May 1608, the ship was engaged in a five-hour battle with three Spanish galleys. In June, she was sent with larger ships to capture the fortress of Taffaso on Makian Island. A month later, she was brought inside the reef at Ternate for repairs. It seems that she was hauled on her side to repair the bottom but this caused further damage, and the ship was condemned as beyond repair.

==Replica==
The Duyfken Replica Project was founded by the Dutch-born Australian historian Michael John Young. Young became aware of &quot;Duyfken&quot; as early as 1976 and lobbied extensively for a new replica project after the launch of the Endeavour replica in Fremantle, Australia in the mid-1990s.

The Duyfken Replica committee was established in 1995 by Michael Young and retired journalist James Henderson. This led to the establishment of the Friends of the Duyfken group then ultimately, the Duyfken 1606 Replica Foundation. The Foundation was initially chaired by entrepreneur Michael G. Kailis of Perth, who led the charge in raising the building budget.

On 27 March 1997, Dutch Crown Prince William-Alexander laid the &quot;Duyfken&quot; replica&#x27;s keel at the Duyfken Replica Ship Yard in front of the Fremantle Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Western Australia.

A full size reproduction of &quot;Duyfken&quot; was built by the &quot;Duyfken 1606 Replica Foundation&quot; jointly with the Maritime Museum of Western Australia and launched on 24 January 1999 in Fremantle. She then undertook an expedition to Banda in Indonesia and sailed on a reenactment voyage to the Pennefather River in Queensland. Then to mark the 400th anniversary of the United Dutch East India Company (VOC) the ship sailed from Sydney, to Queensland, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa, Namibia, and finally Texel in the Netherlands. The ship then conducted a six month exhibition tour of The Netherlands. While in the Netherlands, the floor of the hold was replaced by antique Dutch bricks.

The story of the construction of the replica and the ship&#x27;s major voyages is published in a book, &quot;Through Darkest Seas&quot;, by the former Project Director and Chair of the Duyfken 1606 Replica Foundation, Graeme Cocks.

For a period in 2005, &quot;Duyfken&quot; was berthed alongside the Old Swan Brewery on the Swan River in Perth, Western Australia. The replica was open for visits by the public.

In 2006, Western Australia played a big role in the 400th anniversary of the original &quot;Duyfken&quot;″s visit to Australia. A national group called &quot;Australia on the Map: 1606–2006&quot; was formed to commemorate the arrival of &quot;Duyfken&quot; and to mark this important milestone in Australia&#x27;s history, by also giving recognition to all who followed her and contributed to the mapping of the Australian coast.

&quot;Duyfken&quot; was berthed at the Queensland Maritime Museum in Southbank, Brisbane, Queensland until early 2011, when she was then placed on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. In 2012 she returned to Fremantle.

In November 2020, the Foundation announced that &quot;Duyfken&quot; would return to the Australian National Maritime Museum. COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions prevented the crew from travelling from New South Wales to Fremantle to sail the ship, so it was transported on a larger vessel to Newcastle, then sailed from there to Sydney, arriving on 22 December 2020. , the replica &quot;Duyfken&quot; continues to be situated in Darling Harbour, Sydney.

<text>Lane Allen Evans (August 4, 1951 – November 5, 2014) was an American attorney and politician who served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 until 2007, representing the 17th District of Illinois. Evans announced that he would not seek reelection in November 2006 and retired at the end of the 109th Congress, due to the increasingly debilitating effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Background==

Evans was born in 1951 in Rock Island, Illinois, and attended Alleman High School and Augustana College there. He served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, stationed in Okinawa. After leaving the Marines in 1971, Evans enrolled at Augustana College in Rock Island, graduating in 1974. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University in 1977 and he started his legal career as an attorney with the Quad Cities Legal Clinic [Mid America Law Offices, Ltd.] in Moline.

In 1982, Evans ran for and won the Democratic nomination for Illinois&#x27;s 17th congressional district, which included most of Illinois&#x27; share of the Quad Cities area. It had been renumbered from the 19th District since Illinois lost two districts after the 1980 census. The district had been in Republican hands for all but two years since 1939. However, the brand of Republicanism that prevailed in the district had traditionally been a moderate one. Evans got a significant boost when 16-year incumbent Tom Railsback was defeated for renomination by the more conservative Republican, State Senator Kenneth McMillan. Taking advantage of hardships from that year&#x27;s recession, Evans won by around 5 percentage points. Evans earned the highest opposition (90%) to President Reagan&#x27;s agenda of any congress member during his first congressional session and then handily defeated McMillan in a 1984 rematch. Despite Ronald Reagan&#x27;s gigantic 1984 landslide victory that year, Evans pulled in 57% to Reagan&#x27;s 54% -besting the president by more than 5,000 votes in the 17th Congressional District. This was one of the few congressional districts where Reagan&#x27;s percentage in the two-way was lower than the three-way in 1980.

Evans faced opposition in his next four campaigns, and beat his republican 1990 opponent by more than 50,000 votes with 67% of the vote. In 1994, Republicans retook the House, yet Evans held his seat and won by nine points over a little-known Republican, Jim Anderson, who spent almost no money. This emboldened the Republicans for 1996, when Evans faced Mark Baker, an anchor at WGEM-TV in Quincy (the third-largest city in the district). Presidential candidate Bill Clinton carried the district by a healthy 30,000 votes, and Evans defeated Baker by 11,000 votes. A 1998 rematch was closer, with Evans only winning by 6,000 votes. A third run by Baker in 2000 saw Evans win by 10 points. Redistricting after the 2000 census made Evans safer. Decatur and part of Springfield were added while some more rural areas were taken out. The redistricting process, guided by House Speaker and 14th District Congressman Dennis Hastert and 3rd District Congressman Bill Lipinski, solidified the holdings of many Illinois incumbents. Evans was re-elected in 2002 and 2004.

Evans is credited with passage of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 which he sponsored. In 1995 he was awarded the Silver Helmet award from American Veterans Group (AMVETS). Evans was also instrumental in the election of Barack Obama during the 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois.

Beginning in 1995, Evans battled Parkinson&#x27;s disease. While his previous opponents did not make an issue of it, his 2004 opponent, Andrea Zinga (a former anchorwoman at KWQC-TV and WQAD-TV in the Quad Cities) claimed he was not able to fully represent the members of his district due to his health concerns. However, this tactic backfired, and Evans won handily. During his tenure, Evans was one of the most liberal members of the House, and probably Illinois&#x27; most liberal congressman from outside Chicago. A founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the House Populist Caucus he had a near-perfect lifetime rating from Americans for Democratic Action, while the American Conservative Union gave him its lowest rating of any congressman outside Chicago. 

Evans was one of 31 Democrats in the House of Representatives to vote to reject Ohio&#x27;s 20 electoral votes in the 2004 Presidential Election, despite Republican President George Bush winning the state by 118,457 votes.

In 2019 his biography &quot;Guts: The Lane Evans Story&quot; was published by Strong Arm Press, authored by Devin Hansen.

==FEC actions==
On June 27, 2005, Evans&#x27; campaign committee agreed to pay $185,000 to settle an investigation by the Federal Election Commission. The inquiry stemmed from allegations of illegal coordination between the 17th District Victory Fund, the Rock Island Democratic Central Committee and the congressman&#x27;s campaign during the 1998 and 2000 election cycles. According to the FEC press release:

The Rock Island Democratic Central Committee, for its part, agreed to a civil penalty of $30,000.

==Retirement and death==
Evans won the Democratic primary in 2006 and was poised for a rematch against Zinga. On March 28, 2006, however, Evans announced that he would not stand for a 13th term in November 2006. He made a brief return to Washington in June 2006. His withdrawal from the general election left local Democrats with the task of finding a replacement candidate. Their choice was Congressman Evans&#x27; district director, Phil Hare, who was elected. 
On November 5, 2014, Evans died at the age of 63 in a nursing home in East Moline, Illinois, from complications brought on by Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The Lindenmeier site in Larimer County contains artifacts dating from approximately 8720 BCE.

When explorers, early trappers, hunters, and gold miners visited and settled in Colorado, the state was populated by American Indian nations. Westward expansion brought European settlers to the area and Colorado&#x27;s recorded history began with treaties and wars with Mexico and American Indian nations to gain territorial lands to support the transcontinental migration. In the early days of the Colorado gold rush, Colorado was a Territory of Kansas and Territory of Jefferson. On August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted as a state, maintaining its territorial borders.

==Historic Native American people==
*Ancestral Puebloans — A diverse group of peoples that lived in the valleys and mesas of the Colorado Plateau
*Apache Nation — An Athabaskan-speaking nation that lived in the Great Plains in the 18th century, then migrated southward to Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, leaving a void on the plains that was filled by the Arapaho and Cheyenne from the east.
*Arapaho Nation — An Algonquian-speaking nation that migrated westward to the base of the Rocky Mountains in the late 19th century and settled on the piedmont and the eastern plains. They were relocated entirely out of Colorado in 1865 following the Colorado War.
*Cheyenne Nation — An Algonquian-speaking nation very closely related to the Arapaho. Like the Arapaho, they migrated westward in the 18th century to the base of the Rockies. They often lived in bands interspersed among the Arapaho, and were also relocated out of Colorado in the 1860s.
*Comanche Nation — A Numic-speaking nation that lived on the High Plains of southeastern Colorado. Closely related to the Shoshone, they acquired the horse from the Spaniards and roamed the southern Great Plains. The Comanche were removed to Indian territory.
*Shoshone Nation — A Numic-speaking nation that inhabited intermountain valleys along the north edge of the state, especially in the Yampa River valley, up through the late 19th century. Areas included North Park and Browns Park.
*Ute Nation — A Numic-speaking nation that has lived in the Southern and the Western Rocky Mountains for many centuries. It&#x27;s believed that the ancestors of the Ute first arrived in Colorado anywhere from 2000 to 1000 years ago. Their leaders were Chief Ouray and his wife Chipeta. They often clashed with the Arapaho and Cheyenne, and resisted the encroachment of these nations into the mountains. Until the 1880s, the Ute controlled nearly all of Colorado west of the continental divide, a situation that eroded after the silver boom of 1879. After clashing with white settlers in the 1880s in the Meeker Massacre, they were nearly entirely relocated out of the state into Utah, except for two small reservations in southwestern Colorado.

==European settlement==
The first Europeans to visit the region were Spanish conquistadors. Juan de Oñate who lived until 1626, founded what would become the Spanish province of Santa Fé de Nuevo México among the pueblos of the Rio Grande on July 11, 1598. In 1787 Juan Bautista de Anza established the settlement of San Carlos near present-day Pueblo, Colorado, but it quickly failed. This was the only Spanish attempt to create a settlement north of the Arkansas River. Colorado became part of the Spanish province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spaniards traded with Native Americans who lived there and established the &quot;Comercio Comanchero&quot; (Comanche Trade) among the Spanish settlements and the Native Americans.

In 1803 the United States acquired a territorial claim to the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains by the Louisiana Purchase from France. However, the claim conflicted with Spain&#x27;s claim to sovereignty over the territory. Zebulon Pike led a U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region in 1806. Pike and his troops were arrested by Spanish cavalry in the San Luis Valley, taken to Chihuahua, then expelled from Mexico.

Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain on September 16, 1810. In 1819, the United States ceded its claim to the land south and west of the Arkansas River to Spain with the Adams-Onís Treaty, at the same time purchasing Florida. Mexico finally won its independence with the Treaty of Córdoba signed on August 24, 1821, and assumed the territorial claims of Spain. Although Mexican traders ventured north, settlers stayed south of the 37th parallel north until the United States signed a peace treaty with the Ute Nation in 1850.
During the period 1832 to 1856, traders, trappers, and settlers established trading posts and small settlements along the Arkansas River, and on the South Platte near the Front Range. Prominent among these were Bent&#x27;s Fort and Fort Pueblo on the Arkansas and Fort Saint Vrain on the South Platte. The main item of trade offered by the Indians was buffalo robes, see Early history of the Arkansas Valley in Colorado and Forts in Colorado.

In 1846 the United States went to war with Mexico. Mexico&#x27;s defeat forced the nation to relinquish its northern territories by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. This opened the Southern Rocky Mountains to American settlement, including what is now the lower portion of Colorado. The newly gained land was divided into the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, both organized in 1850, and the Territory of Kansas and the Territory of Nebraska, organized in 1854. Most settlers avoided the rugged Rocky Mountains and headed for Oregon, the Deseret, or California, usually following the North Platte River and the Sweetwater River to South Pass in what is now Wyoming.

On April 9, 1851, Hispanic settlers from Taos, New Mexico, settled the village of &quot;San Luis de la Culebra&quot;, then in the New Mexico Territory, but now Colorado&#x27;s first permanent European settlement.

==Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush==
On June 22, 1850, a wagon train bound for California crossed the South Platte River just north of the confluence with Clear Creek, and followed Clear Creek west for six miles. Lewis Ralston dipped his gold pan in a stream flowing into Clear Creek, and found almost $5 in gold (about a quarter of a troy ounce) in his first pan. John Lowery Brown, who kept a diary of the party&#x27;s journey from Georgia to California, wrote on that day: &quot;Lay bye. Gold found.&quot; In a notation above the entry, he wrote, &quot;We called this Ralston&#x27;s Creek because a man of that name found gold here.”

Ralston continued on to California, but returned to &#x27;Ralston&#x27;s Creek&#x27; with the Green Russell party eight years later. Members of this party founded Auraria (later absorbed into Denver City) in 1858 and touched off the gold rush to the Rockies. The confluence of Clear Creek and Ralston Creek, the site of Colorado&#x27;s first gold discovery is now in Arvada, Colorado.

In 1858, several parties of gold seekers bound for the California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River Valley at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in then western Kansas Territory, now northeast Colorado. The gold nuggets initially failed to impress the gold seekers, but rumors of gold in the Rocky Mountains persisted, and several small parties explored the region. In the summer of 1857, a party of Spanish-speaking gold seekers from the New Mexico Territory worked a placer deposit along the South Platte River about above Cherry Creek (in what is today the Overland Park neighborhood of Denver.)

The following year, William Greeneberry &quot;Green&quot; Russell led a party of Cherokee gold seekers from the State of Georgia to search for gold along the South Platte River. In the first week of July 1857, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek (in present-day Englewood) that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region.

News of this discovery soon spread and precipitated the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush. An estimated 100,000 gold seekers flocked to the region over the next three years. The placer gold deposits along the rivers and streams of the region rapidly played out, but miners soon discovered far more valuable seams of hard rock gold, silver, and other minerals in the nearby mountains. This gold rush helped to attract people to the state and resulted in a population boom.

==Territory of Jefferson==

The Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson was organized on October 24, 1859, but the new territory failed to secure federal sanction. The Provisional Government freely administered the region despite its lack of official status until the U.S. Territory of Colorado was organized in 1861.

==Territory of Colorado==
The Territory of Colorado was a historic, organized territory of the United States that existed between 1861 and 1876. Its boundaries were identical to the current State of Colorado. The territory ceased to exist when Colorado was admitted to the Union as a state on August 1, 1876. The territory was organized in the wake of the 1859 Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush, which had brought the first large concentration of white settlement to the region. The organic act creating the territory was passed by Congress and signed by President James Buchanan on February 28, 1861, during the secessions by Southern states that precipitated the American Civil War. The organization of the territory helped solidify Union control over a mineral rich area of the Rocky Mountains.

Statehood was regarded as fairly imminent, as during the run-up to the 1864 presidential election the Republican–controlled Congress was actually eager to get two more Republican senators and three more electoral votes for President Lincoln&#x27;s re-election bid. Territorial Governor John Evans persuaded Congress to adopt an enabling act, but a majority of the 6,192 Coloradoans who voted, in a population of around 35,000, turned down the first attempt at a state constitution and the second attempt at statehood. Later, at the end of 1865, territorial ambitions for statehood were thwarted again, this time by a veto by President Andrew Johnson. Statehood for the territory was a recurring issue during the Ulysses Grant administration, with Grant advocating statehood against a less willing Congress during Reconstruction.

==Colorado War==

The Colorado War (1863–1865) was an armed conflict between the United States and a loose alliance among the Kiowa, Comanche, Arapaho, and Cheyenne nations of Native Americans (the last two were particularly closely allied, which is unusual since the various tribes were notorious for inciting violence against each other). The war was centered on the Eastern Plains of the Colorado Territory and resulted in the removal of these four Native American peoples from present-day Colorado to present-day Oklahoma. The war included a particularly notorious episode in November 1864 known as the Sand Creek Massacre. The battle, initially hailed by the U.S. press as a great victory, was later learned to be one of genocidal brutality. Most of the tribes had their own designs for genocide of the whites. The resulting hearings in the United States Congress regarding the malfeasance of the U.S. Army commander, John Chivington, were a watershed in the white views of the Indian Wars at the close of the American Civil War. In 1868 the U.S. Army, led by George Armstrong Custer, renewed the conflict against the Arapaho and Cheyenne at the Battle of Washita River. This conflict was due to the Natives persistent practice of arbitrary violence against peaceful white settlers.

==Early statehood 1876-1900==
The United States Congress passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the Territory of Colorado to become a state. On August 1, 1876 (28 days after the Centennial of the United States), President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting the state of Colorado to the Union as the 38th state and earning it the moniker &quot;Centennial State&quot;. The borders of the new state coincided with the borders established for the Colorado Territory.

Women won the right to vote in Colorado via referendum on November 7, 1893. Colorado was the first state in the union to grant universal suffrage through a popular vote. (The territory of Wyoming approved the right of women to vote in 1869 through a vote of the territorial legislature.) Governor Davis H. Waite, a left-wing Populist, campaigned for the amendment but he a year later he blamed the women voters for defeating his reelection campaign. Waite favored labor unions and is one of the few American state governors ever to call out the state militia to protect miners from a force raised by mine owners in the Cripple Creek miners&#x27; strike of 1894.

==Mining in Colorado==
Participants in the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush from 1858 to 1861 were called Fifty-Niners and many of the new arrivals settled in the Denver area. Gold in paying quantities was also discovered in the Central City area. In 1879, silver was discovered in Leadville, resulting in the Colorado Silver Boom.

Many early mining efforts were cooperative ventures. However, as easy-to-reach surface deposits played out, miners increasingly turned to hard rock mining. Such industrial operations required greater capital, and the economic concept of mineral rights resulted in periodic conflicts between the mine owners, and the miners who increasingly sold their labor to work in the mines.

As the mines were dug deeper, they became more dangerous, and the work more arduous, creating the conditions for conflict. In 1880, Colorado Governor Pitkin, a Republican, declared martial law to suppress a violent mining strike at Leadville. In the 1890s many Colorado miners began to form unions in order to protect themselves. The mine operators often formed mine owners&#x27; associations in response, setting up the conditions for a conflict. Notable labor disputes between hard rock miners and the mine operators included the Cripple Creek strike of 1894 and the Colorado Labor Wars of 1903–04.

Coal mining in Colorado began soon after the first settlers arrived. Although the discovery of coal did not cause boom cycles as did the precious metals, the early coal mining industry also established the conditions for violent confrontations between miners and mine owners. The usual issues were wages, hours, and working conditions, but miners were also concerned about issues of fairness, and company control over their personal lives.

Early coal mining in Colorado was extremely dangerous, and the state had one of the highest death rates in the nation. During the three decades from 1884 to 1914, more than 1,700 workers died in Colorado&#x27;s coal mines. Coal miners also resented having to pay for safety work such as timbering the mines, and they were sometimes paid in scrip that had value only in the company store, with the cost of goods set by the company.

The Colorado Coalfield War, centered around the 1913-1914 United Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron company, saw dozens die in battles on the Southern Colorado coalfields. The Ludlow Massacre became the peak of the violence, when Colorado National Guard and militia fired into a tent colony of strikers, in which many children were killed. The violence would continue until Woodrow Wilson sent federal soldiers to disarm both sides.

Another coal strike in 1927 is best known for Colorado&#x27;s first Columbine massacre. In 1933, federal legislation for the first time allowed all Colorado coal miners to join unions without fear of retaliation by instituting penalties for mine owners who obstructed collective bargaining.

Like all resource extraction, mining is a boom or bust industry, and over the years many small towns were established, then abandoned when the ore ran out, the market collapsed, or another resource became available. There were once more than a hundred coal mines in the area north of Denver and east of Boulder. The mines began to close when natural gas lines arrived. Coal and precious metals are still mined in Colorado, but the mining industries have changed dramatically in recent decades.

Reports of the revival of molybdenum mining in 2007 resulted in ambivalent responses with Leadville welcoming the opening of the mine at Climax, but strong opposition in Crested Butte over proposed operations at Mount Emmons. Opinion in Rico, site of the Silver Creek stockwork Molybdenum deposit is more divided. There, land slated for development is being bought up by a mining company.

Today there are many small mining towns scattered throughout Colorado, such as Leadville, Georgetown, Cripple Creek, Victor, and Central City. Although many of the mines no longer operate, the remnants of the operations can be seen in the form of mine shafts, outbuildings, and mounds of rock extracted from the hills. Many former mining towns turned to gambling to draw visitors, with Blackhawk and Cripple Creek serving as good examples. The 19th century ended with a difficult law-and-order situation in some places, most notably, Creede, Colorado, where gunmen like Robert Ford (the assassin of Jesse James) and con artist like Soapy Smith reigned.

==&quot;The World&#x27;s Sanitarium&quot;==
Starting in the 1860s, when tuberculosis (TB) was a major deadly disease, physicians in the eastern United States recommended that their patients relocate to sunny, dry climates for their lungs. As a result, the number of people with tuberculosis, called &quot;lungers&quot;, in the state grew alarmingly and without the services or facilities to support their needs. Not knowing how to manage a population of homeless, ill people, many were taken to jail. Because of the number of people with TB and their families who came to Denver for their health, by the 1880s it was nicknamed the &quot;World&#x27;s Sanitarium&quot;. Cynthia Stout, a history scholar, asserted that by 1900 &quot;one-third of Colorado&#x27;s population were residents of the state because of tuberculosis.&quot;

==Twentieth century==

In 1913 through 1914 the Colorado Coalfield War occurred. It started as a strike and ultimately ended in defeat for the union ending with 232 deaths, and crippling labor organizing in the state&#x27;s mines for the next decade.

In the early 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan suddenly built a large membership hostile to Catholics. Its leaders tried to gain political influence but they were unable to get any proposals enacted into law. The members quit and the KKK died out by the late 1920s.

From 1927 to 1928, a statewide coal strike occurred shutting down all mines. It was sponsored by a upstart rival of the main miners&#x27; union and demanded better wages and conditions. During it, the Columbine Mine massacre and Walsenburg Hall killings occurred, where strikers were shot down by guards and policemen. For one particular incident in Trinidad, the mayor was accused of deputizing members of the KKK against the striking workers. The strike ended with a significant victory for the union in May 1928, with an increase in wages and the return of organized labor in the state&#x27;s coal industry. 

The 1930s saw the beginning of the ski industry in Colorado. Resorts were established in areas such as Estes Park, Gunnison, and on Loveland Pass. During WWII, the 10th Mountain Division established Camp Hale to train elite ski troops.

In the 1940s, the Republican governor of Colorado, Ralph Carr, spoke out against racial discrimination and against the federal internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.

In 1967, Governor John A. Love signed the nation&#x27;s first liberalized abortion law. The late 1960s saw violence in Denver, in the form of race riots, and college buildings being burned by radicals. The Family Dog Denver music venue opened that year, ushering in the hippie movement in the state, to the great consternation of city and state leaders and parents, leading to several municipal and federal court cases. It also made Colorado a major music destination thereafter.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Colorado was an epicenter for the Chicano Movement. Colorado has a significant population of Mexican-American, Hispanic and Chicano people. Major events that affected the Chicano Movement happened in Colorado, such as Corky Gonzales&#x27; Crusade for Justice and &quot;The Plan Espiritual de Aztlán&quot;, the deaths of Los Seis de Boulder, and the death of Ricardo Falcón. Leaders of the movement worked with national figures like Cesar Chavez and the lettuce workers strike, and Coloradans held their own actions like the Kitayama Carnation Strike.

In 1972, Colorado became the only state to reject the award of hosting the Olympic Games after they had been granted. When Representative Lamm led a successful movement to reject a bond issue for expenses related to hosting the event, the International Olympic Committee relocated the 1976 Winter Olympics to Innsbruck, Austria. No venue had rejected the award before nor has any venue since.

In 1999, the Columbine High School massacre became the most devastating high-school massacre in United States history until the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018.

==Twenty-first century==
On July 20, 2012, not far from the location of the aforementioned massacre at Columbine High School, 12 people were killed and 70 people were injured in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, when James Eagan Holmes, a former neuroscience doctoral student, walked into an Aurora, Colorado Cinemark movie theater with multiple firearms, and started shooting at random at people trying to escape during a midnight Thursday showing of &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre and, in terms of both the dead and wounded in the number of casualties, was the largest single mass shooting in U.S. history.

Colorado is now 1 of 15 states that have legalized both medical and recreational marijuana, allowing them to tax the product. As of July 2014, six months after recreational shops began sales of marijuana in Colorado, the state has enjoyed a tax revenue of 45 million with 98 million expected by the end of the calendar year. This is in addition to increased economic revenues from &quot;pot tourists.&quot;

As of July 9, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 35,000 people in Colorado and killed 1,544.

As of August 2022, over 1.6 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Colorado with over 13,000 deaths.

<doc id="412154" wikidata="Q467891" url="?curid=412154" title="Ray LaHood">
<text>Raymond H. LaHood ( ; born December 6, 1945) is an American politician who served as the 16th United States Secretary of Transportation from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the Illinois House of Representatives (1982–1983) and United States House of Representatives (1995–2009).

In 2015, &quot;Seeking Bipartisanship: My Life in Politics&quot;, a book by Ray LaHood, coauthored with Frank H. Mackaman of The Dirksen Congressional Center, was published by Cambria Press.

In 2017, LaHood admitted to the FBI that while holding federal office he had accepted a $50,000 payment from a foreign national for personal home repairs, and that he violated federal government ethics by not reporting the payment on his Office of Government Ethics Form 278. In 2019, government prosecutors and LaHood agreed to a Non-Prosecution Agreement that required LaHood to admit responsibility, repay the $50,000 loan and pay a $40,000 fine to the U.S. government.

==Early life and education==
LaHood was born in Peoria, Illinois, the son of Edward M. LaHood, a Lebanese American who managed a restaurant, and Mary A. LaHood (née Vogel), who was of German ancestry. In 2006, he was one of four Arab American members of Congress.

He graduated from Spalding Institute (now Peoria Notre Dame High School), worked his way through Canton Junior College and Bradley University in Peoria, earning a Bachelor of Science in education and sociology in 1971.

==Career==
Following graduation, he taught middle school social studies at public and Catholic schools, and has said that &quot;teaching kids ... about the constitution and government&quot; stirred his interest in politics.

LaHood was director of the Rock Island County Youth Services Bureau and then district administrative assistant for U.S. representative Tom Railsback, a Moline, Illinois Republican, from 1977 to 1982. He was appointed in 1982 to fill a vacant seat in the Illinois House of Representatives, serving for nine months, and running for the seat in November 1982, but losing to Democratic candidate Bob DeJaegher. LaHood then became administrative assistant and ultimately the chief of staff to U.S. House Minority Leader Robert Michel, serving from 1982 until 1994.

=== Congress ===
When Michel announced his retirement in 1994, LaHood ran for and won his seat in the House, representing Illinois&#x27;s 18th congressional district. LaHood was one of only three Republicans elected to the House that year who did not sign on to the Contract with America, Newt Gingrich&#x27;s manifesto for a Republican majority, and was a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership. In 1997, in an effort to promote bipartisan cooperation, LaHood organized bipartisan retreats for members of Congress.

During his service in Congress, he became well known among C-SPAN viewers for frequently serving as Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, presiding over more debates than any other member. Most notably, in 1998 he presided over the contentious debate over the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

LaHood was a strong advocate for preserving the legacy of Abraham Lincoln; LaHood&#x27;s district covered much of the territory that Lincoln represented during his single term in the House. LaHood authored a law that established the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which laid the groundwork for celebrating the 16th President&#x27;s 200th birthday in 2009, and he was also a lead Capitol Hill supporter for the Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois.

LaHood served on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from 1995 until 2000, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence beginning in 1998, and the House Appropriations Committee beginning in 2000. In 2005 he voted against renewing the PATRIOT Act, saying he opposed extending its intrusive police powers.

LaHood was said to be considering a challenge to Democratic Governor Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s re-election bid in 2006, but chose to run for another term in Congress instead. He won the 2006 race against Steve Waterworth by a margin of 147,108 (67%) to 71,106 (33%). On July 26, 2007, LaHood stated he would not seek re-election in 2008.

In August 2007, LaHood received a 0% rating from the fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization Club for Growth 2007 RePORK Card. He received an 11% rating from the conservative lobbying group Citizens Against Government Waste in August 2007, and holds a lifetime 49% rating from the group.

In 2007 LaHood considered, but later decided against, applying for the post of president of Bradley University.

During the 2008 presidential election, LaHood supported John McCain, but criticized the rallies being held by McCain&#x27;s vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, saying she should stop &quot;name calling&quot;, and that the tactic could backfire. &quot;This doesn&#x27;t befit the office that she&#x27;s running for. And frankly, people don&#x27;t like it,&quot; he said.

=== Secretary of Transportation ===

On December 19, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced that he would nominate LaHood to be the next Transportation Secretary. LaHood served on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from 1995 to 2000. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee he won praise for his &quot;skills as an arbiter&quot; in being able to bridge sometimes bitter partisan divides in the Congress, something the position would require. Some critics alleged a reputation for pork barrel spending, including in support of campaign contributors. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that of the $60 million in earmarks LaHood secured for his district in 2008, $9 million went to campaign donors.

His nomination was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on January 21, 2009. He was, with Robert Gates, one of two Republican members of the original Obama Cabinet.

On February 3, 2010, LaHood was criticized for advice he was asked to give while testifying before a congressional committee regarding Toyota&#x27;s recall of 2.3 million vehicles due to sudden acceleration, wherein he suggested Toyota owners stop driving their cars. LaHood qualified his statement within an hour and a half of his testimony, spelling out that he meant &quot;owners of any recalled Toyota models (should) contact their local dealer and get their vehicles fixed as soon as possible.&quot;

LaHood is a supporter of airline passenger rights to facilities, food and water during lengthy on-aircraft delays. He is also a strong proponent of high-speed rail, saying &quot;This is what the American people want. If you build it, they will come.&quot;

On December 6, 2011, LaHood accepted the resignation of FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt, who was charged with drunk driving near his Washington home. In February 2013, LaHood lamented the amount of infrastructure spending that was approved by Congress during his tenure at the Department of Transportation. &quot;America is one big pothole right now,&quot; LaHood said in an interview on &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; on National Public Radio. He went on to mention that Congress passed a $105 billion surface transportation bill last year, but he lamented the fact that the measure only provided appropriations for road and transit projects until 2014. &quot;Congress passed a two-year bill. Ordinarily they would pass a five year bill,&quot; he said. &quot;It was only a two-year bill because they couldn&#x27;t find enough money to fund a five-year bill.&quot;

LaHood announced his plans to step down as Transportation Secretary at the end of Obama&#x27;s first term in 2013. He did not seek any public office after that and instead entered the private sector. On January 29, 2013, LaHood announced he would resign as the Secretary of the Department of Transportation upon the confirmation of his successor by the United States Senate. President Obama nominated Anthony Foxx, the incumbent Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, to succeed LaHood. Foxx was subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate and was sworn into the position on July 2, 2013.

===Post-federal career===
On November 21, 2019, Governor J. B. Pritzker nominated LaHood to serve as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Board of Trustees. He resigned his job in April 2021 after it emerged that he had paid a $40,000 fine for failing to disclose a $50,000 loan he had received from Lebanese-Nigerian businessman Gilbert Chagoury.

LaHood did not support Donald Trump in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections, and endorsed the Democratic nominee Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024.

==Honors==
In May 2013, Illinois State Representative Jehan Gordon-Booth, who, like LaHood did in the U.S. Congress, represents a central Illinois district, introduced legislation in the Illinois House of Representatives Rules Committee (House Joint Resolution 35) that, if passed by the state House and Senate and signed by Governor Pat Quinn, would rename a 6-mile stretch of Interstate 74 from the Murray Baker Bridge (over the Illinois River between Tazewell and Peoria Counties) to Sterling Avenue exit as the Ray LaHood Highway. That section corresponds to much of what was contained in the major multi-year revision that was the Upgrade 74 project in the last decade (the 2000s) that LaHood had backed in the later years of his tenure in the U.S. House.

Also that month, in recognition of his Congressional and Cabinet service as he neared his last days in office, a portrait of him (with a bust of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s head in the background—LaHood had represented his 18th Illinois congressional district and named the headquarters of his agency after him) by Simmie Knox. The portrait was unveiled and dedicated at the Abraham Lincoln U.S. Department of Transportation Building in the presence of LaHood&#x27;s family, U.S. Merchant Marines, Shaun Donovan (Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development), and Janet Napolitano (Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security), as well as his predecessor in Congress for Illinois&#x27;s 18th congressional district, former U.S. House Minority Leader Robert Michel.

He was Inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2016 in the area of Government and Law. The new international terminal, with full U.S. Customs, TSA and Port of Entry services, at the General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport, was named for him in April 2016. It opened in late May 2016.

==Electoral history==
LaHood&#x27;s congressional seat, Illinois&#x27;s 18th congressional district, has been Republican since 1939.

* Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1994, write-ins received 955 votes. In 1998, write-ins received 2 votes.

LaHood did not to seek re-election in 2008, and Barack Obama nominated him to be U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Illinois State Representative Aaron Schock of Peoria won the seat for the Republicans in the 2008 election.

==Personal life==
LaHood and his wife Kathleen have a residence in Peoria, Illinois. Ray and Kathy have four children—Darin, Amy, Sam, and Sara. Their son Darin LaHood is a current member of the U.S. House of Representatives, having represented Illinois&#x27;s 18th congressional district since a 2015 special election, and previously served in the Illinois Senate.

On January 21, 2012, LaHood&#x27;s son, Sam LaHood, was detained by the Egyptian government and not allowed to leave the country as part of a politically charged criminal investigation by the Egyptian government into the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) monitoring local elections in Egypt. LaHood&#x27;s son is the Egypt director of the International Republican Institute. The Egyptian government detained twelve NGO representatives from leaving Egypt.

On February 5, 2012, Egyptian authorities charged LaHood&#x27;s son and 42 other individuals with &quot;spending money from organizations that were operating in Egypt without a license.&quot; Nineteen Americans were part of the 42 charged. The U.S. government said that $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt could be withheld if the investigation was not finished quickly. Faiza Abu Naga, Egypt&#x27;s Minister of International Cooperation, was seen as the person pushing the investigation forward. Sam LaHood left Egypt along with several foreign NGO workers on March 1, 2012. Sam LaHood was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; by an Egyptian criminal court, and convicted of operating without a license and receiving foreign funding. He was given a five-year jail term and fined 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($143).

==Federal investigation==
In 2012, while serving as U.S. Secretary of Transportation, LaHood accepted a $50,000 check that he knew had originated from Gilbert Chagoury, a foreign national. LaHood failed to disclose this on two government ethics forms, and he also made misleading statements to the FBI when asked about the source of the check.

The Department of Justice considered the investigation resolved in March 2021 after LaHood agreed to pay a $40,000 fine.

<doc id="412155" wikidata="Q7871418" url="?curid=412155" title="USS Mackerel (SS-204)">
<text>USS &quot;Mackerel&quot; (SS-204), the lead ship of her class of submarines, was the first ship of the United States Navy named for the mackerel. &quot;Mackerel&quot; and her near-sister &quot;Marlin&quot; (designed and built by Portsmouth Navy Yard) were prototype small submarines which the Navy was exploring to replace the aging S-class submarines.

==Construction==
Her keel was laid down on 6 October 1939, at the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 28 September 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Cora Furlong (née Glover), wife of Rear Admiral William R. Furlong, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, and commissioned on 31 March 1941.

==Wartime service==
Throughout World War II, &quot;Mackerel&quot;, assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 at New London, Connecticut, participated in the training and improvement of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s submarine force. Designed as an experimental submarine, she provided support services to the Underwater Sound Laboratory and training services to the Submarine and the Prospective Commanding Officers Schools at New London, in addition to training Allied surface vessels and aircraft in antisubmarine warfare.

Although most of her time was spent in the New London area, she steamed as far north as Casco Bay and as far south as the Chesapeake Bay to conduct antisubmarine training exercises. While in the New London-Narragansett Bay area she often worked with Task Group 28.4, the antisubmarine development detachment, as well as with the Underwater Sound Laboratory, thus aiding, both tactically and technically, in the development of submarine-related knowledge.

On 8 April 1942, an aircraft identified by &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s crew as a United States Army Air Forces Lightning fighter mistook &quot;Mackerel&quot; for a German U-boat and dropped four bombs which straddled her track while she was conducting exercises with the U.S. Navy patrol vessel south of the Watch Hill buoy off Watch Hill, Rhode Island. The bombs ricocheted off the water and did not explode. Neither &quot;Mackerel&quot; or &quot;Sapphire&quot;, which was off &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s starboard quarter at the time, suffered damage or casualties.

&quot;Mackerel&quot; departed New London on 12 April 1942 bound on the surface for Norfolk, Virginia. She was about off Cape Charles on the coast of Virginia on 14 April when the United States Coast Guard cutter sighted her at 20:30. Unaware of plans for &quot;Mackerel&quot; to be in the area and unsure of her identity, &quot;Legare&quot;′s crew suspected her of being a German U-boat and closed with her, but established her identity before mounting an attack. &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s crew accepted &quot;Legare&quot;′s offer to escort &quot;Mackerel&quot; the rest of the way to Norfolk, and the two vessels headed for Norfolk at 21:30. By 23:15, &quot;Legare&quot; was about astern of &quot;Mackerel&quot; when she saw &quot;Mackerel&quot; make two quick course alterations and changed course herself to conform to &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s movements. &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s crew, meanwhile, sighted two torpedoes headed for her and evaded them, then sighted what they believed was a German U-boat on the surface and observed it firing a single torpedo at &quot;Legare&quot;. &quot;Mackerel&quot; fired two torpedoes at the U-boat, which outran &quot;Mackerel&quot; and disappeared into the darkness apparently unscathed. &quot;Legare&quot; sighted a torpedo headed directly for her which her crew thought &quot;Mackerel&quot; had fired, and took evasive action, and the torpedo passed down &quot;Legare&quot;′s port side at a distance of only . &quot;Legare&quot; lost contact with &quot;Mackerel&quot; and searched for the U-boat for the next hours but found no sign of it. A subsequent investigation of the incident by the Eastern Sea Frontier found it impossible to reconcile the reports of the two vessels and concluded that &quot;Mackerel&quot; had mistakenly fired a torpedo at &quot;Legare&quot;.

Continuing her voyage toward Norfolk alone after losing contact with &quot;Legare&quot;, &quot;Mackerel&quot; again sighted a U-boat at 05:08 on 15 April 1942 near the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. She fired a torpedo at the U-boat, but observed no indications of a hit, and the U-boat outdistanced her. She signaled the U.S. Navy patrol vessel , which was on patrol outside the Chesapeake Bay, and reported her sighting. &quot;Tourmaline&quot; joined &quot;Mackerel&quot;, but found no evidence of a U-boat in the area. The two purported U-boat sightings on 14 and 15 April 1942 were &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s only contacts with enemy forces during her career.

After temporary duty with the Fifth Naval District, during which she conducted antisubmarine warfare maneuvers in the Chesapeake Bay with U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Navy planes, &quot;Mackerel&quot; headed back north to resume her duties at New London. At 09:50 on 4 May 1942, she was operating off the coast of Rhode Island when the American tanker &quot;El Lago&quot; sighted her and mistook her for a German U-boat, and &quot;El Lago&quot;′s United States Navy Armed Guard
detachment opened gunfire on &quot;Mackerel&quot; about south of Watch Hill Light at . &quot;Mackerel&quot; sustained no damage, and did not require assistance from two U.S. Navy patrol boats and a United States Army tug sent to her aid.

At the end of the war, &quot;Mackerel&quot; was ordered to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was decommissioned on 9 November 1945, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 November 1945. She was sold for scrapping to the North American Smelting Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 24 April 1947.

==In popular culture==

The 1943 World War II submarine movie &quot;Crash Dive&quot;, starring Tyrone Power, features footage of &quot;Mackerel&quot;′s sister ship portraying the fictional U.S. Navy submarine USS &quot;Corsair&quot;, with her conning tower modified to resemble that of &quot;Mackerel&quot;.

A fictional submarine named USS &quot;Mackerel&quot; that fought in the Pacific during World War II is featured in the 2005 novel &quot;Pride Runs Deep&quot; by R. Cameron Cooke. In the concluding historical note the author, a submarine officer, acknowledges the real USS &quot;Mackerel&quot; (SS-204).

<text>USS &quot;Mackerel&quot; (SST-1), originally known as USS &quot;T-1&quot; (SST-1), was the lead ship of the &quot;T-1&quot;-class of training submarines. She was the second submarine of the United States Navy named for the mackerel, a common food and sport fish, and was in service from 1953 to 1973. She was one of the smallest operational submarines ever built for the U.S. Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;T-1&quot; was originally planned as an experimental auxiliary submarine with hull number AGSS-570, but she was redesignated as a training submarine (SST-1) and her hull number was changed to SST-1. She was laid down on 1 April 1952, at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 17 July 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Charles R. Muir, and placed in non-commissioned service as USS &quot;T-1&quot; on 9 October 1953.

==Service history==

===Training, target, and equipment testing services, 1954–1966===
After completing sea trials in the New London, and Massachusetts Bay areas, &quot;T-1&quot; departed in February 1954 for Key West, Florida. Arriving at Key West, she commenced operations with submarine and antisubmarine forces in the areas of southern Florida and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, providing services to the Fleet Training Group working up recently constructed and recently overhauled antisubmarine warships.
On 15 July 1956, &quot;T-1&quot; was renamed &quot;Mackerel&quot;, but retained her hull number, SST-1.

Following her renaming, &quot;Mackerel&quot; participated in fleet exercises off the United States East Coast, mainly conducting training assignments and providing services as a target, including some for the Fleet Sonar School at Key West. She also made several cruises testing new equipment for submarines. On 2 April 1957, she departed Key West on a special sound-damping project during a voyage to Annapolis, Maryland. She conducted more training and target cruises into the early 1960s.

In 1963, &quot;Mackerel&quot; conducted the first of her test and evaluation voyages. Departing Key West on 8 July 1963, she sailed to the British West Indies where she tested acoustical developments in submarine hulls for a two‑week period in waters near the British West Indies. In addition to resumption of her routine duties, she again operated in the West Indies in February 1964, again performing tasks related to evaluating submarine-hull acoustic developments.

From 7 March 1965 to 4 April 1965, &quot;Mackerel&quot; joined her sister ship and attack submarines , , and , along with a task force under Commander, Mine Force, in participating in mine warfare maneuvers.

===Testing equipment for &quot;NR-1&quot;, 1966-1967===

During May and June 1966, Electric Boat installed special equipment in &quot;Mackerel&quot; at Groton. &quot;Mackerel&quot; then transited south to Key West, arriving there on 26 June 1966. At Key West, she conducted experimental work during the rest of 1966 and in early 1967 to acquire data to be used in the development of future U.S. Navy submarines. She evaluated equipment intended for the NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft, including keel-mounted wheels for rolling over the ocean floor, thrusters, external television cameras, a manipulator arm, and experimental sonar. &quot;Mackerel&quot; &quot;bottomed&quot;—deliberately settled on the sea floor—some 225 times during the nine-month evaluation period. She completed this assignment during March 1967, after which she had some of her special equipment removed. At the same time she undertook the additional task of providing shiphandling training for submarine force junior officers. During June and July 1967, while &quot;Mackerel&quot; in drydock at Key West, additional special project equipment was removed from her.

===Target services, 1967-1973===
&quot;Mackerel&quot; resumed operations at Key West in 1967, running submerged to serve as a target for vessels used to train sonar operators at the Fleet Sonar School; at the same time, she undertook the additional task of providing shiphandling training for submarine force junior officers. She also acted as a target for surface and air antisubmarine warfare forces practicing off the Florida coast and in the Caribbean during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1971 and 1972, she provided target and training services for antisubmarine warfare units of the United States Atlantic Fleet in the Key West and the Mayport/Jacksonville, Florida, operating areas. Apparently, her non-commissioned service period ended when she was finally commissioned sometime in 1971.

&quot;Mackerel&quot; made her last dive on 21 July 1972. After that, she remained in service with a reduced crew and conducted junior officer and midshipman training on the surface regularly through October 1972. She was taken out of service on 3 January 1973.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Mackerel&quot; and her sister were decommissioned on 31 January 1973 in a dual ceremony at Naval Station Key West. Both also were struck from the Naval Vessel Register that day.

&quot;Mackerel&quot; was sunk as a target off Puerto Rico on 18 October 1978.

<doc id="412158" wikidata="Q1701747" url="?curid=412158" title="John Shimkus">
<text>John Mondy Shimkus (, born February 21, 1958) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from 1997 to 2021, representing the 20th, 19th and 15th congressional districts of Illinois.

Shimkus is a member of the Republican Party. On August 30, 2019, he announced that he would not seek re-election for his seat in 2020 and was succeeded by fellow Republican Mary Miller.

==Early life, education, and career==
Shimkus is a lifelong resident of Collinsville, part of the Metro East portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area. He is the son of Kathleen N. (née Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus. His paternal grandfather was of Lithuanian descent. Shimkus earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the United States Military Academy. After serving his five-year United States Army commitment, he entered the United States Army Reserve, retiring in 2008 as a lieutenant colonel. While in the U.S. Army, Shimkus earned the Expert Infantry Badge, Ranger Tab, and Parachutist Badge. He served overseas with the 54th Infantry Regiment in West Germany.

Shimkus earned a teaching certificate from Christ College Irvine (now Concordia University Irvine) and began teaching at Metro East Lutheran High School in Edwardsville. He earned an MBA from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1987. Shimkus first ran for office in 1989, when he was elected a Collinsville Township trustee. A year later, he was elected as Madison County treasurer—the first Republican elected to a countywide post in 10 years. In 1994, Shimkus became the first Republican to be re-elected as county treasurer in 60 years.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Record===
Shimkus was a key leader in the effort to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act, which was amended in 2016 by the Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act. Shimkus voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
** Subcommittee on Energy and Power
** Subcommittee on Environment and Economy (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Health
* Republican Study Committee

===Caucus memberships===
* House Baltic Caucus
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus

==Political positions==

===Climate change===
On March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, during a United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of carbon dioxide in global warming:

It&#x27;s plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.

Shimkus has quoted the Bible to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood. He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on &quot;something that you cannot stop versus the changes that have been occurring forever&quot;.

===Food safety===
Shimkus has been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president. Of the bill, he said: &quot;When you&#x27;re talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority.&quot;

===Keystone Pipeline===
In May 2013, Shimkus stated he would renew his support for the Keystone Pipeline. The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian crude oil through the Midwest, including Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.

===National security===
Shimkus spoke positively of President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from specified countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated that &quot;This temporary halt will give Congress and the new Administration time to evaluate and improve the vetting process, and in the meantime gives Secretary Kelly authority to grant exceptions to the restrictions as needed. One of those exceptions must be to green card holders, who have already undergone extensive screening.&quot; In October 2019, he criticized Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, and resigned as a co-chair for Trump&#x27;s 2020 campaign in Illinois.

===Cannabis===
Shimkus has a &quot;D&quot; rating from marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML for his voting history regarding cannabis-related causes.

==Political campaigns==
In 1992, while still serving as Madison County treasurer, he won the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. House seat in what was then the 20th district. He was defeated by 10-year Democratic incumbent Dick Durbin.

Four years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the United States Senate. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced State Representative Jay C. Hoffman in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.

However, he would never face another general election contest nearly that close. He faced only one credible Democratic opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th district, then held by two-term Democratic representative David Phelps. The new district retained Phelps&#x27; district number, but was geographically and demographically more similar to the old 20th district, as Shimkus retained 60% of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other&#x27;s staffers of stalking their families. Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, with Democrats flipping the Governorship and State Senate, Shimkus defeated Phelps with 55% of the vote. This was the only time he received below 60% in a reelection bid.

Shimkus announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.

In 2012, Shimkus&#x27; district was renumbered as the 15th district after Illinois lost another district. It lost much of its northern portion to the 13th district, previously numbered as 15th, which was ultimately won by his former projects director, Rodney Davis. The old 19th had been trending Republican over the years, like southern Illinois as a whole. However, the new 15th was, on paper, one of the most Republican districts in the Midwest. Shimkus was reelected four more times from this district with over 70 percent of the vote.

When seeking his 11th term in 2016, Shimkus faced Illinois State Senator Kyle McCarter in the Republican primary. McCarter ran to the political right of Shimkus and criticized his accommodation with the Obama administration as well as national Republican party leadership. No other party even put up a candidate, meaning whoever won the primary would be assured of victory in November. Shimkus won the primary with 60.4% of the vote to McCarter&#x27;s 39.6%. He then won the general election unopposed.

FEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in 2005. The fund also made contributions to Peter Roskam, a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois&#x27;s 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to David McSweeney, a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois&#x27;s 8th district, in 2006. In 2006, the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned. Shimkus earlier said he was considering removing Valente, but he did not want to act too quickly because it might suggest there was something improper about their relationship.

==Electoral history==
The was disbanded after the 2000 census due to reapportionment and Illinois&#x27; loss of a U.S. House seat, which is why Shimkus faced David D. Phelps, incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the 2010 census, so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district. The 15th district includes a large part of southern and south-western Illinois and a small part of the Metro East, where Shimkus resides.




























==Personal life==
Shimkus has been married to the former Karen Muth since 1987. They have three children: David, Joshua, and Daniel. They are members of Holy Cross Lutheran Church (LCMS) in Collinsville.

<text>The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct (; ) is a navigable aqueduct that carries the Llangollen Canal across the River Dee in the Vale of Llangollen in northeast Wales.

The 18-arched stone and cast iron structure is for use by narrowboats and was completed in 1805 having taken ten years to design and build. It is wide and is the longest aqueduct in Great Britain as well as the highest canal aqueduct in the world. A towpath runs alongside the watercourse on one side.

The aqueduct was to have been a key part of the central section of the proposed Ellesmere Canal, an industrial waterway that would have created a commercial link between the River Severn at Shrewsbury and the Port of Liverpool on the River Mersey. Although a less expensive construction course was surveyed further to the east, the westerly high-ground route across the Vale of Llangollen was preferred because it would have taken the canal through the mineral-rich coalfields of North East Wales. Only parts of the canal route were completed because the expected revenues required to complete the entire project were never generated. Most major work ceased after the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805.

The structure is a Grade I listed building and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pontcysyllte&quot; is Welsh for &quot;Cysyllte Bridge&quot; or &quot;Bridge of Cysyllte&quot;, Cysyllte being the township of the old parish of Llangollen in which the southern end of the bridge lies. The northern end of the bridge was in Trefor Isaf township, also in Llangollen parish.

Other translations such as &quot;bridge of the junction&quot; or &quot;bridge that links&quot; are modern false etymologies, derived from the name&#x27;s apparent similarity to the word &quot;&quot; (plural of &quot;cyswllt&quot;) which means connections or links.

==History==

The aqueduct was designed by civil engineers Thomas Telford and William Jessop for a location near an 18th-century road crossing, Pont Cysyllte. After the westerly high-ground route was approved, the original plan was to create a series of locks down both sides of the valley to an embankment that would carry the Ellesmere Canal over the River Dee. After Telford was hired the plan was changed to an aqueduct that would create an uninterrupted waterway straight across the valley. Despite considerable public scepticism, Telford was confident his construction method would work because he had previously built a cast-iron trough aqueduct – the Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal.

The aqueduct was one of the first major feats of civil engineering undertaken by Telford, who was becoming one of Britain&#x27;s leading industrial civil engineers; although his work was supervised by Jessop, the more experienced canal engineer. Ironwork was supplied by William Hazledine from his foundries at Shrewsbury and nearby Cefn Mawr. The work, which took around ten years from design to construction, cost around of £47,000. Adjusted for inflation this is equivalent to no more than £ in , but represented a major investment against the contemporary GDP of some £400 million.

The Pontcysyllte aqueduct officially opened to traffic on 26 November 1805. A plaque commemorating its inauguration reads:
The nobility and gentry, the adjacent Counties having united their efforts with the great commercial interests of this country. In creating an intercourse and union between England and North Wales by a navigable communication of the three Rivers, Severne Dee and Mersey for the mutual benefit of agriculture and trades, caused the first stone of this aqueduct of Pontcysyllty , to be laid on the 25th day of July MDCCXCV [1795]. When Richard Myddelton of Chirk, Esq, M.P. one of the original patrons of the Ellesmere Canal was Lord of this manor, and in the reign of our Sovereign George the Third. When the equity of the laws, and the security of property, promoted the general welfare of the nation. While the arts and sciences flourished by his patronage and the conduct of civil life was improved by his example.
The bridge is long, wide and deep. It consists of a cast iron trough supported above the river on iron arched ribs carried on eighteen hollow masonry piers (pillars). Each of the 18 spans is wide. With the completion of the aqueduct, the next phase of the canal should have been the continuation of the line to Moss Valley, Wrexham where Telford had constructed a feeder reservoir lake in 1796. This would provide the water for the length of canal between Trevor Basin and Chester. The plan to build this section was cancelled in 1798, and the isolated feeder and a stretch of navigation between Ffrwd and a basin in Summerhill was abandoned. Remnants of the feeder channel are visible in Gwersyllt. A street in the village is still named . The physical construction was undertaken by John Simpson (d.1815) of Shrewsbury.

With the project incomplete, Trevor Basin just over the Pontcysyllte aqueduct would become the canal&#x27;s northern terminus. In 1808 a feeder channel to bring water from the River Dee near Llangollen was completed. In order to maintain a continual supply, Telford built an artificial weir known as the Horseshoe Falls near Llantysilio to maintain water height.

Subsequently, the Plas Kynaston Canal was built to serve industry in the Cefn Mawr and Rhosymedre areas in the 1820s. There might have been another canal extension (&quot;Ward&#x27;s&quot;) but detailed records do not survive. Goods traffic was brought down to the canal by the Ruabon Brook Tramway which climbed towards Acrefair and Plas Bennion. This railway was eventually upgraded to steam operation and extended towards Rhosllannerchrugog and Wrexham.

In 1844, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company, which owned the broad canals from Ellesmere Port to Chester and from Chester to Nantwich, with a branch to Middlewich, began discussions with the narrow Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which ran from Nantwich to Autherley, where it joined the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The two companies had always worked together, in a bid to maintain their profits against competition from the railways, and amalgamation seemed to be a logical step. An agreement was worked out by August, and the two companies then sought an act of Parliament to authorise the takeover. This was granted as the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. ii) on 8 May 1845, when the larger Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company was formed.
In 1846, the canal and the aqueduct became part of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company. But the intent of the merger was to build railways at a reduced cost, by using the existing routes of the canals they owned. By 1849, the plan to turn canals into railways had been dropped. As the aqueduct was largely in an area that was served by railways owned by the Great Western Railway, the London and North Western Railway was more than happy for the canal to remain open as long as it remained profitable. With the start of the First World War in 1914, the Shropshire Union – of which the Pontcysyllte aqueduct was a part – served the war effort with its fleet of more than 450 narrow boats.

Commercial traffic on the canal greatly declined after a waterway breach near Newtown, Powys (now part of the Montgomery Canal) in 1936. By 1939 boat movements across the aqueduct to Llangollen had ceased. The canal was formally closed to navigation under the London Midland and Scottish Railway (Canals) Act 1944 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 6. c. ii)). On 6 September 1945, due to inadequate maintenance, the canal breached its banks east of Llangollen near Sun Bank Halt. The flow of hundreds of tons of water washed away the embankment of the railway further down the hill, tearing a crater deep. This caused the first traffic of the morning, a mail and goods train composed of 16 carriages and two vans, to crash into the breach, killing one and injuring two engine crew.

The aqueduct was saved (despite its official closure to waterway traffic) because it was still required as a water feeder for the remainder of the Shropshire Union Canal. The aqueduct also supplied drinking water to a reservoir at Hurleston. In 1955 the Mid &amp; South East Cheshire Water Board agreed to maintain the canal securing its future.

In the latter half of the 20th century, leisure boating traffic began to rise. In a rebranding exercise by British Waterways in the 1980s, the former industrial waterway was renamed the Llangollen Canal. It has since become one of the most popular canals for holidaymakers in Britain because of its aqueducts and scenery. The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is now maintained and managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust (branded Glandŵr Cymru in Wales). Otters have been seen in the area.

==Construction and maintenance==

The mortar used lime, water and ox blood. Blood and extracts of blood containing haemoglobin have been used in the construction and building industry since antiquity as air entraining colloids to inexpensively strengthen mortar exposed to freeze-thaw temperature cycles.

The iron castings for the trough were produced at the nearby Plas Kynaston Foundry, Cefn Mawr, which was built by the Shrewsbury ironfounder and millwright William Hazledine in the hope of gaining the contract. The rib castings may have been made at Hazledine&#x27;s original works at Coleham, near Shrewsbury. The trough was made from flanged plates of cast iron, bolted together, with the joints bedded with Welsh flannel and a mixture of white lead and iron particles from boring waste.

After 25 years the white lead was replaced with ordinary tar. As with Telford&#x27;s Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the plates are not rectangular but shaped as voussoirs, similar to those of a stone arch. There is no structural significance to their shape: it is a decorative feature only, following the lines of the stiffening plates (see below) in the castings beneath.

In nearby Cefn Mawr a high quartz content sandstone was discovered at the location where the new Cefn Druids football stadium has since been built. Known locally as &#x27;The Rock&#x27;, the sandstone was extracted and worked here into the many numerous shapes as required by the engineers. Many remnants of the workings are still visible alongside Rock Road which links Rhosymedre to Plas Madoc.

The supporting arches, four for each span, are in the form of cast-iron ribs, each cast as three voussoirs with external arches cast with an un-pierced web to give greater strength, at the cost of extra weight. Using cast iron in this way, in the same manner as the stone arch it supersedes, makes use of the material&#x27;s strength in compression. They also give an impression of greater solidity than would be the case were the webs pierced. This impression is enhanced by the arrangement of strips of thicker stiffening incorporated into the castings, arranged in the manner of joints between voussoirs.

Cast plates are laid transversely to form the bed of the canal trough. The trough is not fastened to the arches, but lugs are cast into the plates to fit over the rib arches to prevent movement. The aqueduct was left for six months with water inside to check that it was watertight. A feature of a canal aqueduct, in contrast with a road or railway viaduct, is that the vertical loading stresses are virtually constant. According to Archimedes&#x27; principle, the mass (weight) of a boat and its cargo on the bridge pushes an equal mass of water off the bridge.

The towpath is mounted above the water, with the inner edge carried on cast-iron pillars in the trough. This arrangement allows the water displaced by the passage of a narrowboat to flow easily under the towpath and around the boat, enabling relatively free passage. In 1831, the original wooden towpath was replaced with an iron structure cantilevered off the side of the trough but, contrary to some texts, the wide trough, extending under the towpath to allow water displacement, remains as originally built. Pedestrians, and the horses once used for towing, are protected from falling from the aqueduct by railings on the outside edge of the towpath, but the holes in the top flange of the other side of the trough, capable of mounting railings, were never used. The trough sides rise only about above the water level, less than the depth of freeboard of an empty narrow boat, so the helmsman of the boat has no visual protection from the impression of being at the edge of an abyss. The trough of the Cosgrove aqueduct has a similar structure, although it rests on trestles rather than iron arches. It is also less impressively high.

Every five years the ends of the aqueduct are closed and a plug in one of the highest spans is opened to drain the canal water into the River Dee below, to allow inspection and maintenance of the trough.

The aqueduct was most recently closed for maintenance in mid 2024 and maintenance will be resuming in January 2025 with a further full closure of the aqueduct until mid-March.

==World Heritage Site==
The aqueduct and surrounding lands were submitted to the &quot;tentative list&quot; of properties being considered for UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 1999. The aqueduct was suggested as a contender in 2005—its 200th anniversary year—and it was formally announced in 2006 that a larger proposal, covering a section of the canal from the aqueduct to Horseshoe Falls would be the United Kingdom&#x27;s 2008 nomination.

The length of canal from Rhoswiel, Shropshire, to the Horseshoe Falls, including the main Pontcysyllte Aqueduct structure as well as the older Chirk Aqueduct, were visited by assessors from UNESCO during October 2008, to analyse and confirm the site management and authenticity. The aqueduct was inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List on 27 June 2009.

<text>The Passamaquoddy (Passamaquoddy: &quot;Peskotomuhkati&quot;, Plural: &quot;Peskotomuhkatiyik&quot;) are a Native American/First Nations people who live in northeastern North America. Their traditional homeland, &quot;Peskotomuhkatikuk&quot;, straddles the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the U.S. state of Maine in a region called Dawnland. They are one of the constituent nations of the Wabanaki Confederacy.

The Passamaquoddy Tribe in Maine is a federally recognized tribe. The Passamaquoddy people in Canada have an organization known as the Peskotomuhkati Nation, but it does not have official First Nations status.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Passamaquoddy&quot; is an anglicization of the Passamaquoddy word &quot;peskotomuhkati&quot;, the prenoun form (prenouns being a linguistic feature of Algonquian languages) of &quot;Peskotomuhkat&quot; (&quot;pestəmohkat&quot;), their endonym, or the name that they use for themselves. &quot;Peskotomuhkat&quot; literally means &quot;pollock-spearer&quot; or &quot;those of the place where pollock are plentiful&quot;, reflecting the importance of this fish in their culture. Their method of fishing was spear-fishing, rather than angling or using nets. Passamaquoddy Bay is shared by both New Brunswick and Maine; its name was derived by the English settlers from the Passamaquoddy people.

==History==

The Passamaquoddy have an oral history supported with visual imagery, such as birchbark etching and petrographs prior to European contact. Among the Algonquian-speaking tribes of the loose Wabanaki Confederacy, they occupy coastal regions along the Bay of Fundy, Passamaquoddy Bay, and Gulf of Maine, and along the St. Croix River and its tributaries. Traditionally, they had seasonal patterns of settlement. In the winter, they dispersed and hunted inland. In the summer, they gathered more closely together on the coast and islands, and primarily harvested seafood, including marine mammals, mollusks, crustaceans, and fish.

Settlers of European descent repeatedly forced the Passamaquoddy off their original lands from the 1800s. After the United States achieved independence from Great Britain, the tribe was eventually officially limited to the current Indian Township Reservation, at , in eastern Washington County, Maine. It has a land area of and a 2000 census resident population of 676 persons. They also control the small Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation in eastern Washington County, which has a land area of and a population of 749, per the 2010 census.

Passamaquoddy have also lived on off-reservation trust lands in five Maine counties. These lands total almost four times the size of the reservations proper. They are located in northern and western Somerset County, northern Franklin County, northeastern Hancock County, western Washington County, and several locations in eastern and western Penobscot County. The total land area of these areas is 373.888 km2 (144.359 sq mi). As of the 2000 census, no residents were on these trust lands.
The Passamaquoddy also live in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada, where they have a chief and organized government. They maintain active land claims in Canada but do not have legal status there as a First Nation. Some Passamaquoddy continue to seek the return of territory now within present-day St. Andrews, New Brunswick, which they claim as &quot;Qonasqamkuk,&quot; a Passamaquoddy ancestral capital and burial ground.

==Populations and languages==
The total Passamaquoddy population is around 3,576 people. About 500 people, most if not all over the age of 50, speak the Maliseet-Passamaquoddy language, shared (other than minor differences in dialect) with the neighboring and related Maliseet people. It belongs to the Algonquian branch of the Algic language family. The University of Maine published a comprehensive &quot;Passamaquoddy Dictionary&quot; in 2008. Another resource for the language is the online Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal, which includes many videos, subtitled in English and Passamaquoddy, of native speakers conversing in the language. Most of the people speak English as their first language.

While the Passamaquoddy population in Canada is much smaller than that in Maine, there is an organization called the Peskotomuhkati Nation, with a formal structure and a chief, Hugh Akagi. Most of its people speak French and English. It is not recognized by the Canadian government as constituting a First Nation. In 2004, Chief Akagi was authorized to represent the Passamaquoddy at events marking the 400th anniversary of French settlement of St Croix Island (the first French effort at permanent settlement in the New World). This indicates that the government had acknowledged the tribe to some extent, and progress is being made in formal recognition.

== Special political status in Maine ==


The Passamaquoddy, along with the neighboring Penobscot, are given special political status in Maine. Both groups are allowed to send a nonvoting representative to the Maine House of Representatives. Although these representatives cannot vote, they may sponsor any legislation regarding American Indian affairs, and may co-sponsor any other legislation.

<text>Garth Boomer (1940 – 1993) was an influential educationalist working in Australia. Since 1995 the Australian Association for the Teaching of English has held a Garth Boomer Memorial Address in his honour. He was particularly influential in the teaching of English, and he was president of the Australian Association for the Teaching of English for a time.

==Early life==
He was born on 12 September 1940 at Mount Barker, South Australia. He was a son of South Australian-born parents Charlemagne Carlyle Guilford Boomer, who was a brickmaker, and Rita Ivy, née Miels. He received his primary education at Littlehampton Primary School and Adelaide Boys High Schools. He graduated with honors from the University of Adelaide in 1962, where he received his Bachelor of Arts.

==Career==
After graduation he was a teacher of English, Latin and mathematics in South Australian State secondary schools. Later he became the first consultant in English in South Australia. He completed his Master of Arts at the London Institute of Education in 1972–73.

In 1980 he became a director of the Wattle Park Teachers Centre, which was the curriculum and teacher development centre for the South Australian education system. In 1984 he moved to Canberra, where he took a position of director of the Curriculum Development Centre. In 1985 he became chairman of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. In 1988, he became chairman of the Schools Council, one of four councils of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. In July 1988 returned to South Australia to serve as an Associate Director-General of Education. From 1981 until 1984 he was a president of the Australian Association for the Teaching of English. From 1983 until 1985 he also was a chair of the International Federation for the Teaching of English. From 1989 until 1993 he was the South Australian representative and vice-chairman of the Australian Children&#x27;s Television Foundation. He contributed to the creation of &quot;Lift Off&quot;, which was an innovative approach to children&#x27;s television.

He was awarded Life Membership at &quot;Australian Association for Teaching English&quot; in 1977.

==Death==
He died of brain cancer on 16 July 1993 in the Daw House Hospice, Adelaide and was cremated.

Posthumously an education building at the University of South Australia was named after him.

==Private life==
On 2 January 1965 he married Jean Graham McNaught, who was a teacher at the Albert Street Methodist Church, Brisbane. They had two daughters and a son.

==Awards==

<text>Václav Brožík (; 6 March 1851, Třemošná – 15 April 1901 Paris) was a Czech painter who worked in the academic style.

== Life ==
He came from a poor family, studying lithography and porcelain painting through apprenticeships. Beginning in 1868, with financial assistance from a local landowner, he was able to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He made a trip to the Netherlands, where he studied the Old Masters, then settled in Paris (despite not being able to speak French), where a letter of recommendation assured him the support of Jaroslav Čermák. In 1879 he married Hermina Sedelmeyer, daughter of the wealthy Parisian art dealer Charles Sedelmeyer. For most of his life, he divided his time between Paris and Prague, where he became a Professor at the Art Academy in 1893.

He was named a member of the Institut de France, partly through the influence of his father-in-law, who also suggested that he do a painting on the theme &quot;Tu Felix Austria Nube&quot; (from an old saying: &quot;Let others wage war: thou, happy Austria, marry&quot;). The result pleased Emperor Franz Joseph I, who was involved in an unhappy marriage. As a result, Brožík was elevated to the nobility.

He also became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, received the Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur and was appointed to the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences. One of his 1884 paintings, showing Columbus soliciting the aid of Queen Isabella, appeared on a United States postage stamp in 1893. 

His health began to decline in 1894, but he threw himself into painting even more diligently. He died suddenly of heart failure in 1901 and was buried in Montmartre. Appreciation of his work suffered a serious decline after his death, as it was considered old-fashioned, but a major retrospective in 2003 has created some renewed interest.

<doc id="412166" wikidata="Q910538" url="?curid=412166" title="Linda Sue Park">
<text>Linda Sue Park (born March 25, 1960) is a Korean-American author who published her first novel, &quot;Seesaw Girl&quot;, in 1999. She has written six children&#x27;s novels and five picture books. Park&#x27;s work achieved prominence when she received the prestigious 2002 Newbery Medal for her novel &quot;A Single Shard&quot;. She has written the ninth book in &quot;The 39 Clues&quot;, &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, published on May 25, 2010.

==Personal life==
Linda Sue Park was born on May 19 1960, in Urbana, Illinois, and was raised outside Chicago. Linda Sue Park&#x27;s parents immigrated to the United States in the 1950s, for their education. Park has been writing poetry and stories since the age of four. Park published her first poem when she was nine years old for &quot;Trailblazer&quot; magazine. Through elementary and high school, she continued to publish poems in magazines for children and young people. She published her first book in 1999, &quot;Seesaw Girl&quot;.

Park competed on the gymnastics team at Stanford University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English. She also obtained advanced degrees in literature from Trinity College in Ireland and a Master of Arts from the University of London.

Before writing her first book, Park worked at many jobs, including public relations for a major oil firm, food journalism for British magazines and newspapers, and teaching English as a second language to college students.

Park lives with her family in Rochester, New York.

==Themes==
Park is best known for her historical fiction. With the exception of three picture books and two novels, all of Park&#x27;s books center upon Korean history and Korean culture. Her first three novels are set in ancient or medieval Korea. However, her fourth novel, &quot;When My Name Was Keoko&quot;, is about the more recent history of the Japanese occupation of Korea during World War II. &quot;Project Mulberry&quot; occurs in a contemporary setting outside Chicago. Park&#x27;s book, &quot;Archer’s Quest&quot;, introduces a historical figure into modern times. Park shares her passion for baseball in her book, &quot;Keeping Score&quot;. Park&#x27;s book, &quot;A Long Walk to Water,&quot; features family friend Salva Dut and his childhood experience growing up in the Sudan as well as another character, Nya who spends her entire day gathering and transporting water to her family.

Park researched her Korean heritage for her books, demonstrated by historical details within the story along with sections for author&#x27;s notes and bibliographies. Her topics feature characteristic elements of Korean culture, including: embroidery (&quot;Seesaw Girl&quot;); kite fighting (&quot;The Kite Fighters&quot;); celadon pottery (&quot;A Single Shard&quot;); silkworms (&quot;Project Mulberry&quot;); Korean food (&quot;Bee-Bim Bop&quot;); and archery (&quot;Archer’s Quest&quot;). She also continues to publish poetry.

<doc id="412169" wikidata="Q5230841" url="?curid=412169" title="USS Marlin (SST-2)">
<text>USS &quot;Marlin&quot; (SST-2), originally USS &quot;T-2&quot; (SST-2), was a &quot;T-1&quot;-class training submarine in commission from 1953 to 1973. She was the second submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the marlin, a large game fish. Except for the first 25 early development pre-World War I submarines, she was one of the smallest operational submarines ever built for the U.S. Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;T-2&quot; was laid down on 1 May 1952 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 14 October 1953, sponsored by Mrs. William R. DeLoach, and commissioned as USS &quot;T-2&quot; on 20 November 1953 with Lieutenant Edward Holt in command.

==Service history==
After shakedown in the Massachusetts Bay area, &quot;T-2&quot;, got underway from New London, Connecticut, in late January 1954 for her home port at Naval Station Key West at Key West, Florida. Assigned to Submarine Squadron 12, Submarine Force, United States Atlantic Fleet, she immediately began operations in the sector from southern Florida to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. For a decade and a half she performed valuable service as a target and training ship and helped to evaluate submarine and antisubmarine warfare equipment and tactics.

Renamed &quot;Marlin&quot; on 15 May 1956, the submarine deployed to Guantanamo Bay for services to the Fleet Training Group in January 1956, July and August 1958, March 1960, and December 1961. In March 1963, &quot;Marlin&quot; participated in the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) demonstration.

From 1963, &quot;Marlin&quot; performed mainly target duty for both surface and air antisubmarine units at the Fleet Sonar School at Key West.

In addition to target and training duty, &quot;Marlin&quot; participated in various fleet operations. From 7 March 1965 to 4 April 1965, for example, &quot;Marlin&quot; joined her sister ship and attack submarines , , and , along with a task force under Commander, Mine Force, in participating in mine warfare maneuvers.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Marlin&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Mackerel&quot; were decommissioned on 31 January 1973 in a dual ceremony at Naval Station Key West. Both also were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register that day.

==Museum ship==
On 15 August 1973, the U.S. Navy donated &quot;Marlin&quot; for use as a museum ship. On 20 August 1974, she was assigned for display as a memorial submarine in Freedom Park at the Greater Omaha Marina at 2000 North 25th Street, in Omaha, Nebraska.

<text>Hardmead is a small village in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the north of the Borough, about west of Bedford, north-east of Central Milton Keynes and north east of Newport Pagnell. The village is close to the A422 road, on a very small road linking that to nearby Newton Blossomville. Together with the neighbouring village of Astwood, it forms the civil parish of Astwood and Hardmead.

The village name is Old English in origin, and means &#x27;Heoruwulf&#x27;s meadow&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was called &quot;Herulfmede&quot;. The village is very small with a population of around 100 people. The nearest pub is located one mile away in Astwood and the nearest shop is about four miles distant.

The former church of St Mary&#x27;s Hardmead is Grade I listed and parts date from the 12th century. It has been redundant since the 1980s and is now in the care of the charity Friends of Friendless Churches. There are monuments in the church to the Catesby family and to the explorer Robert Shedden.

<text>Joseph Christopher Chocola (born February 24, 1962) is an American businessman, lawyer, and former politician who served as the U.S. representative from Indiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 2003 to 2007.

In 2002, Chocola ran for the U.S. House, defeating former Democratic congresswoman Jill Long Thompson. Chocola was a member of the Agriculture, Small Business, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Ways and Means committees. In 2004, he defeated lawyer and then-Mishawaka Marian School Board President Joe Donnelly, later losing in a rematch against Donnelly in 2006.

After leaving Congress, Chocola served as president of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization, from 2009 through the end of 2014.

==Early life, education, and career==
Chocola was born in Jackson, Michigan. He grew up in Michigan, graduating from Williamston High School in 1980. He graduated in 1984 from Hillsdale College, in Hillsdale, Michigan, with a double major in business administration and political economy. While at Hillsdale College he joined the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. After graduation, he went to work at Society National Bank, now known as KeyBank, which had recruited him into its management program in Cleveland. At the time when he left to go to law school, he was employed as a foreign exchange trader for the bank.

Chocola attended law school classes at night at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School, in Lansing, Michigan, while working as a credit manager for his family&#x27;s business, Chocola Cleaning Materials. He graduated in 1988.

In 1988, Chocola was hired as corporate counsel by CTB International in Milford, Indiana, a manufacturer of products for the poultry, egg, swine, and grain production industries, which his grandfather, Howard Brembeck, had founded. He initially managed all the legal aspects of the business as corporate counsel. He then held various management positions until he was named CEO in 1994. In April 1999, he left the CEO position to become chairman of the board.

In August 2002, CTB International was sold to Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm of billionaire Warren Buffett. The Chocola family received 55% of the $140 million paid to shareholders of the company.

==Congressional elections==

===2000===
In the 2000 election, Chocola made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in what was then , losing to incumbent Democrat Timothy J. Roemer by a 52–47% margin. In that campaign, Chocola spent more than $1 million, including $465,000 of his own money.

In the October 8, 2000, edition of the &quot;Elkhart Truth&quot;, an Elkhart, Indiana newspaper, Chocola was quoted as saying that &quot;Bush&#x27;s plan of individual investment of 2 percent of the money is a start. Eventually, I&#x27;d like to see the entire Social Security system privatized. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;risky scheme&#x27;.&quot; In late October, after Roemer had featured that statement in political ads, Chocola said, &quot;There is no one proposing, including me, a plan of total privatization.&quot; The newspaper, saying Chocola had made his statement in meeting its editorial board, refused to retract the story. Roemer refused to stop running the ad despite Chocola&#x27;s contention that the quotation was taken out of context.

===2002===
Roemer retired after his 2001–2003 term. In 2002, Chocola ran again for the open seat, which had been renumbered as the 2nd District after redistricting. In November, he defeated former Congresswoman Jill Long Thompson by a 51–46 margin with 188,446 votes cast, in a race that included campaign appearances by President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and other top Republicans, to assist his bid.

===2004===
In 2004, Chocola defeated Democrat Joe Donnelly by a 54–45% margin with 259,355 votes cast, in an election where Bush received 56 percent of the district&#x27;s vote. In that race, Chocola outspent Donnelly $1.4 million to $700,000. Chocola was assisted by a fundraising visit from Vice President Dick Cheney during the campaign.

===2006===

Chocola defeated Tony Zirkle, an attorney, Navy veteran, and frequent candidate, in the Republican primary on May 2, 2006, by 70% to 30%. In the November general election, Chocola lost to Democratic candidate Joe Donnelly, whom he had defeated in 2004, by a 54–46% margin with 191,861 votes cast.

== House of Representatives (2003–2007)==

According to a profile by the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, &quot;Chocola is a strong supporter of President Bush&quot;. The two do differ on some positions, such as illegal immigration. Chocola has supported (against the President&#x27;s position) the &quot;tough enforcement first&quot; House version of changes in immigration law, in opposition to the President&#x27;s calls for a guest worker program.

In January 2006, Chocola said that great strides were being made in transitioning Iraq from military coalition to police control. He said it was too early to predict when the job will be done.

===Social issues===
* Chocola was a cosponsor of the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2003 and voted for that Amendment when it came to the floor in 2004. He again was a cosponsor of the Marriage Protection Amendment in 2006 (H.J. Res. 88) and voted for the amendment on July 18, 2006.
* He voted in 2005 for an amendment to the Constitution preventing the desecration of the American flag.
* Voted for the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in July 2006, which restricts credit card companies from processing payment towards Internet gambling companies.
* Voted for the Pledge Protection Act in mid-July 2006, which would prevent federal courts from ruling on cases involving the Pledge of Allegiance.
* Voted against overriding President George W. Bush&#x27;s veto of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act in July 2006. The bill would have modified restrictions on embryonic stem cell research and allowed for federal funding of the research.

===Fiscal and economic issues===
* Introduced a bill that would place currency manipulation tariffs on China. He later denounced this bill when he became president of the Club for Growth.
* Voted against increasing the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program by $1 billion in March 2006.
* Voted for the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act in May 2006, which extended tax cuts set to expire over the next seven (7) years.
* Voted for the Permanent Estate Tax Relief Act in June 2006. The bill permanently exempted personal estates of less than $5 million per spouse from estate taxes, and lowered the tax rate on larger estates.
* In the summer of 2006, voted for a bill that would allow private companies to drill for oil in ANWR.
* One of two cosponsors of HELPS Retirees Act (H.R. 2177), also known as the Healthcare Enhancement for Local Public Safety Retirees Act of 2005, which enables retired public safety officers to designate up to $5,000 per year from governmental pension or deferred compensation funds for health care premiums on a pre-tax basis. This earned Chocola an endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters, one of his only endorsements from organized labor.

<doc id="412185" wikidata="Q868608" url="?curid=412185" title="Critical rationalism">
<text>Critical rationalism is an epistemological philosophy advanced by Karl Popper on the basis that, if a statement cannot be logically deduced (from what is known), it might nevertheless be possible to logically falsify it. Following Hume, Popper rejected any inductive logic that is ampliative, i.e., any logic that can provide more knowledge than deductive logic. This led Popper to his falsifiability criterion.

Popper wrote about critical rationalism in many works, including: &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot; (1934/1959), &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; (1945), &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot; (1963), &quot;Unended Quest&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Myth of the Framework&quot; (1994).

==Criticism, not support==
Critical rationalists hold that scientific theories and any other claims to knowledge can and should be rationally criticized, and (if they have empirical content) can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them. Thus claims to knowledge may be contrastingly and normatively evaluated. They are either falsifiable and thus empirical (in a very broad sense), or not falsifiable and thus non-empirical. Those claims to knowledge that are potentially falsifiable can then be admitted to the body of empirical science, and then further differentiated according to whether they are retained or are later actually falsified. If retained, further differentiation may be made on the basis of how much subjection to criticism they have received, how severe such criticism has been, and how probable the theory is, with the &quot;least&quot; probable theory that still withstands attempts to falsify it being the one to be preferred. That it is the &quot;least&quot; probable theory that is to be preferred is one of the contrasting differences between critical rationalism and classical views on science, such as positivism, which holds that one should instead accept the &quot;most&quot; probable theory. The least probable theory is preferred because it is the one with the highest information content and most open to future falsification.

Critical rationalism as a discourse positioned itself against what its proponents took to be epistemologically relativist philosophies, particularly post-modernist or sociological approaches to knowledge. Critical rationalism holds that knowledge is objective (in the sense of being embodied in various substrates and in the sense of not being reducible to what humans individually &quot;know&quot;), and also that truth is objective (exists independently of social mediation or individual perception, but is &quot;really real&quot;).

However, this contrastive, critical approach to objective knowledge is quite different from more traditional views that also hold knowledge to be objective. (These include the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment, the verificationism of the logical positivists, or approaches to science based on induction, a supposed form of logical inference which critical rationalists reject, in line with David Hume.) For criticism is all that can be done when attempting to differentiate claims to knowledge, according to the critical rationalist. Reason is the of criticism, not of support; of tentative refutation, not of proof.

Supposed positive evidence (such as the provision of &quot;good reasons&quot; for a claim, or its having been &quot;corroborated&quot; by making successful predictions) does nothing to bolster, support, or prove a claim, belief, or theory.

In this sense, critical rationalism turns the normal understanding of a traditional rationalist, and a realist, on its head. Especially the view that a theory is better if it is less likely to be true is in direct opposition to the traditional positivistic view, which holds that one should seek theories that have a high probability. Popper notes that this &quot;may illustrate Schopenhauer&#x27;s remark that the solution of a problem often first looks like a paradox and later like a truism&quot;. Even a highly unlikely theory that conflicts with a current observation (and is thus false, like &quot;all swans are white&quot;) must be considered to be better than one which fits observations perfectly, but is highly probable (like &quot;all swans have a color&quot;). This insight is the crucial difference between naive falsificationism and critical rationalism. The lower probability theory is favoured by critical rationalism because the greater the informative content of a theory the lower will be its probability, for the more information a statement contains, the greater will be the number of ways in which it may turn out to be false. The rationale behind this is simply to make it as easy as possible to find out whether the theory is false so that it can be replaced by one that is closer to the truth. It is not meant as a concession to justificatory epistemology, like assuming a theory to be &quot;justifiable&quot; by asserting that it is highly unlikely and yet fits observation.

Critical rationalism rejects the classical position that knowledge is justified true belief; it instead holds the exact opposite: that, in general, knowledge is unjustified untrue unbelief. It is unjustified because of the non-existence of good reasons. It is untrue, because it usually contains errors that sometimes remain unnoticed for hundreds of years. And it is not belief either, because scientific knowledge, or the knowledge needed to, for example, build an airplane, is contained in no single person&#x27;s mind. It is only what is recorded in artifacts such as books.

==Non-justificationism==
William Warren Bartley compared critical rationalism to the very general philosophical approach to knowledge which he called justificationism, the view that scientific theories can be justified. Most justificationists do not know that they are justificationists. Justificationism is what Popper called a &quot;subjectivist&quot; view of truth, in which the question of whether some statement is true is confused with the question of whether it can be justified (established, proven, verified, warranted, made well-founded, made reliable, grounded, supported, legitimated, based on evidence) in some way.

According to Bartley, some justificationists are positive about this mistake. They are naïve rationalists, and thinking that their knowledge can indeed be founded, in principle, it may be deemed certain to some degree, and rational.

Other justificationists are negative about these mistakes. They are epistemological relativists, and think (rightly, according to the critical rationalist) that you cannot &quot;find&quot; knowledge, that there is no source of epistemological absolutism. But they conclude (wrongly, according to the critical rationalist) that there is therefore no rationality, and no objective distinction to be made between the true and the false.

By dissolving justificationism itself, the critical rationalist (a proponent of non-justificationism) regards knowledge and rationality, reason and science, as neither foundational nor infallible, but nevertheless does not think we must therefore all be relativists. Knowledge and truth still exist, just not in the way we thought.

Non-justificationism is also accepted by David Miller and Karl Popper. However, not all proponents of critical rationalism oppose justificationism; it is supported most prominently by John W. N. Watkins. In justificationism, criticism consists of trying to show that a claim cannot be reduced to the authority or criteria that it appeals to. That is, it regards the justification of a claim as primary, while the claim itself is secondary. By contrast, non-justificational criticism works towards attacking claims themselves.

==The pitfalls of justificationism and positivism==
The rejection of &quot;positivist&quot; approaches to knowledge occurs due to various pitfalls that positivism falls into.
# The naïve empiricism of induction was shown to be illogical by Hume. A thousand observations of some event A coinciding with some event B does not allow one to logically infer that all A events coincide with B events. According to the critical rationalist, if there is a sense in which humans accrue knowledge positively by experience, it is only by pivoting observations off existing conjectural theories pertinent to the observations, or off underlying cognitive schemas which unconsciously handle perceptions and use them to generate new theories. But these new theories advanced in response to perceived particulars are not &quot;logically&quot; &quot;induced&quot; from them. These new theories may be wrong. The myth that we &quot;induce&quot; theories from particulars is persistent because &quot;when&quot; we do this we are often successful, but this is due to the advanced state of our evolved tendencies. If we were really &quot;inducting&quot; theories from particulars, it would be inductively logical to claim that the sun sets &quot;because&quot; I get up in the morning, or that all buses must have drivers in them (if you&#x27;ve never seen an empty bus).
# Popper and David Miller showed in 1983 that evidence supposed to partly support a hypothesis can, in fact, only be neutral to, or even be counter-supportive of the hypothesis.
# Related to the point above, David Miller, attacks the use of &quot;good reasons&quot; in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, Miller asserts that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is ampliative and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more &quot;supported&quot; than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. begging the question.

==Variations==
William Warren Bartley developed a variation of critical rationalism that he called pancritical rationalism.

Argentine-Canadian philosopher of science Mario Bunge, who edited a book dedicated to Popper in 1964 that included a paper by Bartley, appreciated critical rationalism but found it insufficient as a comprehensive philosophy of science, so he built upon it (and many other ideas) to formulate his own account of scientific realism in his many publications.

<doc id="412189" wikidata="Q465824" url="?curid=412189" title="Steve Buyer">
<text>Stephen Earle Buyer ( ; born November 26, 1958) is an American former politician who served as the U.S. representative for , and previously the , from 1993 until 2011. In July 2022, Buyer was arrested and charged with insider trading for buying shares of Sprint and Navigant Consulting before both were acquired by other companies, which he knew through his consulting work before the information was made public. Buyer was found guilty in 2023 and sentenced to 22 months in prison. He is a member of the Republican Party.

In Congress, Buyer served as one of the House managers (prosecutors) in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999. He also chaired the House Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs from 2005 to 2007.

On January 29, 2010, Buyer announced he would not seek a tenth term to the House to spend more time with his wife, who has an incurable autoimmune disease. Buyer was also under investigation for ethics violations with respect to the Frontier Foundation that he had founded.
In 2012, Buyer started working for R.J. Reynolds, promoting the use of smokeless tobacco.

==Early life, education and career==
Buyer was born in Rensselaer, Indiana. In 1976, he graduated from North White High School, where he had been class president. In 1980, he received a Bachelor of Science in business administration and management from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, and in 1984, he received a Juris Doctor from the Valparaiso University School of Law.

Buyer served three years on active duty in the Army between 1984 and 1987. His first civilian job, from 1987 to 1998, was as an Indiana state deputy attorney general; he then started his own private law practice. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representative in November 1992, at age 33.

==Military career==
Buyer attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps. As an Army reserve officer, had three years of active duty after graduating from law school in 1984. During the Gulf War (1990–1991), Buyer, then a captain, spent five months on active duty giving legal counsel to commanders and interrogating Iraqi P.O.W.s.

On March 20, 2003, Buyer announced to Congress that &quot;I have been called to active duty in the United States Army. Pending further orders, I request immediate indefinite leave of the United States House of Representatives to accommodate my military duties.&quot; He also said that &quot;a need was identified, of which Congressman Buyer has the unique skill and experience to meet the requirements,&quot; to serve in Iraq. Claiming to be called to active duty, he took a leave of absence from Congress.

Buyer spent his paid absence from Congress in his home in Monticello, Indiana. Ten days later, he said he had not been activated, contradicting his previous statement and that he was returning to Congress. Defense Department rules prevent those on active duty from campaigning for and holding elective office. Thus in June 2003, the Indianapolis Star reported that the Army, in a March 31 letter to Buyer signed by Army secretary Thomas White, had rejected Buyer&#x27;s offer to serve in the Iraq War, because &quot;we are able to meet the need without your participation&quot; and &quot;we are concerned that your presence would put in jeopardy the safety of those serving around you.&quot; 

In April 2004, Buyer was promoted to colonel in the United States Army Reserve by President George W. Bush in the Oval Office.

==U.S. Representative==

*Congressional Steel Caucus

In 1999, Buyer served one of the House managers (prosecutors) in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.

==Political positions==

===Term limits===
In his 1992 campaign, Buyer supported bringing to a vote on the House floor a Congressional amendment for term limits on members of Congress. He voted for the measure and it received a majority of votes, but not the two-thirds majority needed to pass.

===Torture===
Buyer, who interrogated captured Iraqis during the Gulf War, voted against the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, specifically the no torture amendment offered by Senator John McCain. He reasoned that torture was already unlawful. He stated, &quot;I think the people of Indiana need to know that there&#x27;s a lot of grandstanding going on here, there&#x27;s a lot of self-projection.&quot;

===Smoking===
In June 2009, Buyer became the subject of some prime-time TV news attention when he likened the physical effects of smoking tobacco to those of smoking dried, rolled lettuce or grass when taking the floor against the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. He stated:

[Y]ou could have smoked that lettuce and you would still end up with the same problems. You could cut the grass in your yard, dry it and roll it up in a cigarette and smoke it, and you&#x27;re still going to have a lot of problems. It is the smoke that kills, not the nicotine. It&#x27;s the smoke.
==Political campaigns==
When Buyer first ran for Congress in 1992, he faced three-term Democratic incumbent Jim Jontz in what was then the 5th District, comprising twenty primarily rural counties in north central Indiana. Republican Bud Hillis had represented the district for 16 years until his retirement in 1986. Jontz, then a state senator, was elected in the face of divided Republican opposition. Buyer defeated Jontz by just over 5,000 votes. He would never face another contest nearly that close, and was re-elected four times from this district with an average of 62 percent of the vote.

In 2002, Buyer&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 4th District, made up of 12 counties in west central Indiana, after the state lost a district in the 2000s round of redistricting. Buyer had five opponents in the Republican primary, including fellow Republican congressman Brian Kerns. Buyer won with 55 percent of the primary vote. He easily won this heavily Republican district in November with 71 percent of the vote and was re-elected three more times after that with an average of 63 percent of the vote.
===2004/2006===

In November 2004 and November 2006, Buyer defeated Democrat David Sanders, who was running on a pro-veterans benefits and anti-Iraq war platform. 

===2008===

In November 2008, Buyer defeated Democrat Nels Ackerson, spending $895,000 compared to $845,000 by Ackerson. Buyer won with 60 percent of the vote.

===2010 retirement===

On January 29, 2010, Buyer announced his retirement from Congress. In the following January, Buyer became a lobbyist for McKesson Corp.; as he was prohibited from lobbying Congress due to a one-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period mandated for all retired Congressmen by federal law, he stated that his lobbying would be restricted to the executive branch. in 2012 Buyer started working for R.J. Reynolds, promoting the use of smokeless tobacco.

===Campaign funds===
Between January 2006 and October 2009, the most significant combined donations to Buyer&#x27;s campaigns came from the pharmaceutical industry ($263,000) and the healthcare professional industry ($214,000).
In recent years, his largest corporate donors have included Eli Lilly and Company, AT&amp;T Inc. and Reynolds American.

==Frontier Foundation==
In 2003, Buyer created The Frontier Foundation, whose stated purpose is educational funding for college students. The initial $25,000 to start the foundation came from the pharmaceutical lobbying organization PhRMA. The foundation was located in Buyer&#x27;s campaign office until 2009, when after a complaint was filed, it moved to an office 3 blocks away. In addition, weeks before that interview, Buyer&#x27;s campaign finance director, Stephanie (Bowsher) Mattix, who had also managed the Foundation, ceased operating as the Foundation&#x27;s director. She was receiving a salary from the foundation ranging $12,000–$17,000 a year. Buyer&#x27;s daughter Colleen was the president of the foundation until August 1, 2009. His son Ryan, in 2009, was director of the foundation, according to filings with the Indiana Secretary of State 

In early October 2009, Buyer&#x27;s press secretary referred questions to the foundation, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not Congressman Buyer&#x27;s foundation,&quot; although the foundation shared an office with Buyer&#x27;s campaign office in Monticello. Several days later, Buyer said he had created the foundation, with the goal of creating a sustainable organization to award scholarships to high school seniors.

As of the end of 2008, annual fundraising golf outings had raised more than $880,000 for the foundation. Almost all the contributions were from 20 companies and trade organizations that had interests before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Buyer is a member. As of October 2009, the foundation had not awarded any scholarships, and had given out only $10,500 in charitable grants, almost half of which went to a cancer fund run by the chief Washington lobbyist for Eli Lilly and Company. Buyer said the foundation would need to raise at least $1 million to become self-sustaining; it would then begin awarding scholarships.

In June 2009, Buyer said &quot;there is no connection&quot; between his legislative actions and donations to the foundation. &quot;I&#x27;m not an officer. I&#x27;m not a board director,&quot; he said of his role in the non-profit. &quot;Do I help the foundation? Yes, I do. Do I help other charity groups? Yes, I do.&quot;

On January 25, 2010, CREW (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) filed complaints against Rep. Buyer with the Office of Congressional Ethics and the IRS regarding possible ethics and federal tax law violations referencing The Frontier Foundation.
The complaint was later dismissed when Buyer announced his retirement from Congress.

In 2018, the Frontier Foundation was closed by Buyer, the only listed officer, without ever having funded a scholarship.

==Insider trading ==
On July 25, 2022, Buyer was arrested and charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for insider trading. According to the SEC&#x27;s complaint, after leaving Congress in 2011, Buyer formed a consulting firm, the Steve Buyer Group, which provided services to T-Mobile. In March 2018, Buyer attended a golf outing with a T-Mobile executive, from whom he learned about the company&#x27;s then nonpublic plan to acquire Sprint. Buyer began purchasing Sprint securities the next day, and, ahead of the merger announcement, he acquired a total of $568,000 of Sprint common stock in his personal accounts, a joint account with his cousin, and an acquaintance&#x27;s account. The complaint also seeks disgorgement from Buyer&#x27;s wife, Joni Lynn Buyer, who profited when Buyer executed unlawful trades in her brokerage account. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of New York announced related criminal charges.

At the trial, Karen Hensel, a television reporter, told the jury that Buyer traded stocks for her to help her &quot;catch up&quot; financially after they had an affair. Hensel testified that Buyer did not tell her why he chose Sprint or Navigant.

Buyer was found guilty of insider trading on March 10, 2023. On September 19, 2023, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison, ordered to forfeit $354,027 in illegal gains and given a $10,000 fine.

==Personal life==
In 2008, in &quot;Golf Digest&#x27;s&quot; list of the top 200 golfers among political power brokers in Washington, Buyer was ranked 32nd, with a handicap of 5.6.

Buyer&#x27;s daughter Colleen was the president of the Frontier Foundation until August 1, 2009. In 2007, she graduated from Purdue University with a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) 

Buyer&#x27;s son Ryan received a business administration degree from Ball State University in 2008. He was hired in June 2008 as a federal affairs manager for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a major lobbying organization in Washington, D.C., and the largest donor to the foundation.

Buyer&#x27;s wife Joni worked as a Business Systems Analyst at Purdue University, in West Lafayette.

<doc id="412193" wikidata="Q827411" url="?curid=412193" title="Bert Lahr">
<text>Irving Lahrheim (August 13, 1895 – December 4, 1967), known professionally as Bert Lahr, was an American stage and screen actor and comedian. He was best known for his role as the Cowardly Lion, as well as his counterpart Kansas farmworker &quot;Zeke&quot;, in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). He was well known for his quick-witted humor and his work in burlesque and vaudeville and on Broadway.

==Early life, family and education==
Lahr was born as Irving Lahrheim on August 13, 1895, at First Avenue and 81st Street, in the Yorkville section of Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City. He was the son of Jacob Lahrheim (1870–1947), an upholsterer, and Augusta Bessen (1871–1932), daughter of Mildred Bessen (1844–1911) and Edward H Bessen (1841–1902). His parents were German-Jewish immigrants. 

He attended P.S. 77 and Morris High School, although he left school at age 15.

Lahr later served in the U.S. Navy during World War I as a seaman second class.

==Stage career==
Lahr began performing in minor parts on vaudeville stages at age 14. He quit school at age 15 to join a juvenile vaudeville act. He eventually received top billing, working for the Columbia Amusement Company. In 1927, he debuted on Broadway in &quot;Harry Delmar&#x27;s Revels&quot; on November 28, 1927. He played to packed houses, performing classic routines such as &quot;The Song of the Woodman&quot; (which he reprised in the film &quot;Merry-Go-Round of 1938&quot;). Lahr&#x27;s first major success in a stage musical was playing the prizefighter hero of &quot;Hold Everything!&quot; (1928–29). Other musicals followed, notably &quot;Flying High&quot; (1930), Florenz Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Hot-Cha!&quot; (1932), and &quot;The Show is On&quot; (1936) in which he co-starred with Beatrice Lillie. In 1939, he co-starred as Louis Blore alongside Ethel Merman in the Broadway production of &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot;, receiving acclaim.

Later performances included &quot;Burlesque&quot; and &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; on Broadway and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; with a touring company in the 1950s. In 1962 he returned to Broadway, in S. J. Perelman&#x27;s &quot;The Beauty Part&quot;, and won the 1965 Tony for Best Actor in a musical for &quot;Foxy&quot;, an adaption of &quot;Volpone&quot;.

==Film career==

Lahr made his feature film debut in 1931&#x27;s &quot;Flying High&quot;, playing the oddball aviator he had played on stage. He signed with New York-based Educational Pictures for a series of two-reel comedies. When that series ended, he went to Hollywood to work in feature films. Aside from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), his movie career was limited. In the 1944 musical comedy film &quot;Meet the People&quot;, Lahr uttered the phrase &quot;Heavens to Murgatroyd!&quot; later popularized by Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Snagglepuss.

===Cowardly Lion in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===
Lahr&#x27;s most famous role was that of the Cowardly Lion in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s 1939 adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Lahr was signed to play the role on July 25, 1938. The lion costume was composed of real lion fur and, under the high-intensity lighting required for Oz&#x27;s Technicolor scenes, the costume was unbearably hot. Lahr contributed ad-lib comedic lines for his character. Many of Lahr&#x27;s scenes took several takes because other cast members, especially Garland, could not complete the scenes without laughing. The Cowardly Lion is the only character who sings two solo song numbers: &quot;If I Only Had the Nerve&quot; (performed after the initial meeting with Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man in the forest) and &quot;If I Were King of the Forest&quot; (performed while he and the others are awaiting their audience with the Wizard.)

An original Cowardly Lion costume worn by Lahr in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is in the holdings of The Comisar Collection, which is also the largest collection of television artifacts and memorabilia in the world.

In June 2013, Lahr&#x27;s original reading script for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, bequeathed to his great-grandson, was appraised with an insurance value of $150,000 on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in an episode filmed in Detroit, Michigan.

===&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;===
Lahr later made the transition to straight theater. He got a script of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, and was greatly impressed but unsure of how the revolutionary play would be received in the United States. It was performed in Europe to great acclaim but was somewhat obscure and intellectual. He co-starred in the US premiere of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1956 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, Florida, playing Estragon to Tom Ewell&#x27;s Vladimir. The performance bombed, with audience members walking out in large numbers, and the critics did not treat it kindly. In his book &quot;Notes on a Cowardly Lion&quot;, Lahr&#x27;s son John states that the problems were caused partly by the choices of the director, including the decision to limit Bert&#x27;s movement on stage; filling the stage with platforms; and a misguided description of the play as a light comedy, along with other difficulties.

Lahr reprised his role in a short-lived Broadway run, co-starring with E. G. Marshall as Vladimir. This time, it was with a new director, Herbert Berghof, who had met with Samuel Beckett, the playwright, in Europe and discussed the play. The set was cleared, and Lahr was allowed more freedom in his performance. Advertisements were taken out urging intellectuals to support the play, which was a success and received enthusiastic ovations from the audience. Lahr was praised and though he claimed he did not understand the play, others would disagree and say he understood it a great deal.

==Television==
Lahr occasionally appeared on television, including NBC&#x27;s live version of the Cole Porter musical &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; (1954), the 1964 Hallmark Hall of Fame production of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, and occasional appearances as the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (for example, December 30, 1956).

He performed in commercials, including a memorable series for Lay&#x27;s potato chips during its long running &quot;Betcha can&#x27;t eat just one&quot; campaign with Lahr appearing in different costumes. He performed in classical works on television adaptations of &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; and the &quot;School for Wives&quot; (1956). He played Moonface Martin in a television version of &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, with Ethel Merman reprising her role as Reno Sweeney and Frank Sinatra appearing as Billy Crocker. In 1959, he played Mr. O&#x27;Malley in an adaptation of &quot;Barnaby&quot; for the anthology series &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. In 1963, he appeared as Go-Go Garrity in the episode &quot;Is Mr. Martian Coming Back&quot; on NBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;.

==Other work==

Among his numerous Broadway roles, Lahr starred as Skid in the Broadway revival of &quot;Burlesque&quot; from 1946 to 1948 and played several roles, including Queen Victoria, in the original Broadway musical &quot;Two on the Aisle&quot; from 1951 to 1952. In the late 1950s, he supplied the voice of a bloodhound in &quot;Old Whiff,&quot; a short cartoon produced by Mike Todd which featured the olfactory Smell-O-Vision process developed for Todd&#x27;s feature film &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot; (1960).

In 1964, Lahr won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for his role in the musical &quot;Foxy&quot;. At the American Shakespeare Festival he played Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1960), for which he received the Best Shakespearean Actor of the Year Award.

&quot;Laughter is never too far away from tears,&quot; he reflected on his comedy. Lahr said: &quot;You will cry at a peddler much easier than you would cry at a woman dressed in ermine who had just lost her whole family.&quot;
==Personal life==
Lahr&#x27;s first wife, Mercedes Delpino, developed mental health problems that left her hospitalized. This complicated his relationship with his second wife, Mildred Schroeder, as he had legal problems with getting a divorce in New York. She grew tired of waiting, became involved with another man and married him. Lahr was heartbroken, but eventually won her back. Lahr had three children: a son, Herbert (1928–2002), with Delpino, and a son John (b. 1941) and daughter Jane (b. 1943) with Schroeder. John Lahr is a London-based drama critic who married the actress and comedian turned psychotherapist Connie Booth (&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;) in 2000; she was previously married to British actor/comedian John Cleese. Jane Lahr is an author and literary editor who was married to drama critic Martin Gottfried.

Lahr was an avid golfer. He was considered a serious personality offstage, prone to melancholy and, like his mother, hypochondria. Lahr&#x27;s son John has written, &quot;While we were growing up, there was not one Oz image or memento of any kind in the apartment&quot;. He also describes his father as living in &quot;habitual solitude&quot; and plagued by &quot;morbid worry&quot;, &quot;moroseness&quot; and &quot;the thick fog of some ontological anxiety, which seemed to have settled permanently around [him] and was palpable, impenetrable&quot;.

A staunch Democrat, he supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign in the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
Lahr died on December 4, 1967, at the age of 72. Around the time of his death, he was filming &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot;. The official cause of death was listed as pneumonia. Lahr had been hospitalized on November 21 for what was reported as a back ailment. However, his son John explained that although two weeks earlier, Bert &quot;had returned home at 2 a.m., chilled and feverish, from the damp studio where &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; was being filmed,&quot; and although &quot;newspapers reported the cause of death as pneumonia...he succumbed to cancer, a disease he feared but never knew he had.&quot; (Bert Lahr&#x27;s father had also died of cancer.) The official cause of death was reported as being massive intestinal hemorrhage.

At the time, most of Lahr&#x27;s scenes had already been shot. &quot;All in the Family&quot; creator/producer Norman Lear told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;through judicious editing, we will be able to shoot the rest of the film so that his wonderful performance will remain intact.&quot; The producers used test footage of Lahr, plus an uncredited voice double and a body double, burlesque actor Joey Faye, to complete Lahr&#x27;s role.

Lahr was buried at the Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens, New York.

<text>Berry is a small Australian village in the Shoalhaven region of the New South Wales South Coast, located south of the state capital, Sydney. It has many historical buildings which are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register. Berry attracts many tourists who come to enjoy the diversity of landscapes, including coastal beaches, rich dairy farming, and forested mountains. The village hosts a local Produce Market which is held twice each month on the second Saturday and fourth Sunday. Together with Kiama to the north, Berry acts as a gateway through to other towns and villages along the South Coast of NSW via the Princes Highway and the South Coast railway line. Major highway building projects in and around Berry have now bypassed the village, creating uninterrupted motorway conditions for coastal travel south to Nowra and the South Coast and north to Wollongong and Sydney. This has resulted in the removal of all but local and visitor traffic within the village. Planning is underway to create a pedestrian-friendly precinct in and around Queens Street (the main commercial street).

==History==

The Aboriginal people of the area were the Wodi Wodi people of the Dharawal nation, and the area was known as Boon-ga-ree. In the 1810s, George William Evans, Government Surveyor, reported on the Berry district as a possible settlement and on the good stands of red cedar. Subsequently, itinerant timber cutters visited to cut and send cedar to Sydney.

Alexander Berry, with his business partner Edward Wollstonecraft, pioneered European settlement in the Shoalhaven region from 1822, initially securing land grants to the south of the Shoalhaven River and later to the north (including the Berry district). The locality was known as Broughton Creek from its beginning in 1825 as a private town and part of a large pastoral holding called &quot;Coolangatta&quot;. The first European settlers of this locality were seven free sawyers employed by Alexander Berry, who camped there in 1825. Soon after a tannery began operation. In the 1840s a saw mill powered by a water wheel started. By 1866, a very substantial town had grown on the either side of Broughton Creek. On the Pulman Street side a post office, school, tannery and store were established, while on the other side of the creek an Inn was opened. By this time the population had grown to 300 and the area was declared a Municipality.

In 1873 Alexander Berry died and his brother David Berry became the owner of the estate. He encouraged the growth of the town by establishing an Agricultural Showground and giving land to four religious denominations to build churches in the town.

The name of the town was changed from Broughton Creek to Berry in 1889, following the death of David Berry, Alexander&#x27;s brother, to honour the Berry family. After his death the outlying land of the Coolangatta Estate was gradually sold. The town continued to grow and flourish as a service centre for saw milling and dairying industries. From the 1980s, these industries have diminished, and tourism is now an important activity.

== Heritage listings ==
Berry has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Beach Road: David Berry Hospital
* Illawarra railway: Berry railway station
* 135 Queen Street: Berry Museum
* 58 Victoria Street: Berry Courthouse

==Geography and landmarks==

The township of Berry lies on the South Coast railway line, and on the Princes Highway (Highway 1) between Nowra and Kiama. For much of its early history the town depended on timber cutting and dairy farming, with a tannery and boat building also present, but today, Berry thrives on tourism, with many souvenir shops, art galleries, antiques and collectibles shops, cafes, restaurants, and hotels. A local public hospital bequeathed by the Berry family, the David Berry Hospital, now serves as a rehabilitation hospital and palliative care hospice.

==Population and culture==

At the the population of Berry was 2,467. 78.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 7.4%. 93.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.0%, Anglican 21.0% and Catholic 20.9%.

Berry has formed a mainly urban rather than farming community, with an influx of city dwellers attracted to a rural lifestyle with ease of access back to the Sydney metropolitan area and its attractions (&#x27;sea changers&#x27; and &#x27;tree changers&#x27;). Most dairy farms have been subdivided into &#x27;hobby farms&#x27; of small acreages, and the town businesses have changed to meet needs of tourists and the expanding hospitality industry.

Berry is the first truly rural town south of Sydney, and is situated on a coastal plain bounded by the escarpment to the west, and the Tasman Sea to the east. The township of Berry is surrounded by the districts of Broughton Vale, Broughton Village, Foxground, and Toolijooa to the north, Harley Hill, Far Meadow, Jerry Bailey/Coolangatta and Back Forest to the east (with the beaches of Gerroa, Seven Mile Beach, and Shoalhaven Heads along the coast), Jaspers Brush and Meroo Meadow to the south, and Bundewallah, Bellawongarah, Cambewarra, Woodhill, Wattamolla, and the village of Kangaroo Valley are situated in the mountains to the west.

===Events===
Some regular events that draw locals and tourists alike to Berry include: country markets on the first Sunday of the month; the Berry Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Show on the first weekend in February; the Musicale festival held throughout May and June; and the Garden Festival in October. Berry is also home to the Berry Magpies rugby league team, part of the New South Wales Group 7 rugby league competition and the Berry netball team.

During the annual Berry Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Show there is held the Annual Berry Showgirl Competition. This is an event where young women aged between 18 and 25 are judged on various attributes including personality, rural knowledge, presentation, communication and speaking skills, and local and international current affairs throughout a full day of judging. The judging panel consists of three judges selected by the Show Committee. Judging involves a sit down luncheon during the day which is attended by showgirl entrants and judges, followed by individual interviews, and then concluding that evening with a ball, or formal dance, where each entrant is required to give a speech. The winner is announced on the Saturday night of the annual show, in the centre of the main oval, in front of the crowd. The winner then goes on to represent Berry at the Zone judging which encompasses towns from Milton to the Hawkesbury region. Zone winners then compete at the final stage, which is a weeks judging held at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. This event, run by the Royal Agricultural Society, is not a beauty contest but rather a way of promoting and encouraging rural women.

<text>The Confluence Project is a series of outdoor installations and interpretive artworks located in public parks along the Columbia River and its tributaries in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. Each art installation explores the confluence of history, culture and ecology of the Columbia River system. The project draws on the region&#x27;s history, including Native American traditional stories and entries from the Lewis and Clark Expedition journals, to &quot;evoke a landscape and a way of life submerged in time and memory.&quot; The project reaches from the mouth of the Columbia River to Hells Canyon.

Artist Maya Lin designed installations that followed the path of Lewis and Clark through the Columbia River Basin. Lin collaborated with landscape architects, such as Johnpaul Jones, to produce earthen works that helped restore natural environments. Each artwork was based on traditions grounded in Native American cultures and drew text from Lewis and Clark&#x27;s journals.

Confluence is a community supported nonprofit 501(C)(3) based in Vancouver, Washington, incorporated in 2002. The mission is to connect people to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices.

<doc id="412197" wikidata="Q3127988" url="?curid=412197" title="Hartwell, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Hartwell is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Stone with Bishopstone and Hartwell, in central Buckinghamshire, England. It is to the south of Aylesbury, by the village of Stone. In 1971 the civil parish had a population of 102. On 1 April 1986 the parish was abolished and merged with Stone to form &quot;Stone with Bishopstone and Hartwell&quot;.

The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;spring frequented by deer&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Herdewelle&quot;.

The ruined Hartwell Church was designed by the architect Henry Keene and completed in 1756. It is one of the most important early Gothic revival churches in England and is Grade II* listed. It has an octagonal centre with twin towers. In the north and south bays are rose windows, while other windows are represented as ogee arches. In the clerestory are quatrefoil windows. Inside, the church once had a plaster fan vault but this has now fallen in, and the church&#x27;s windows are boarded. Today the building appears more as a garden folly, than a former place of worship.

Attached to the estate is the former hamlet of Lower Hartwell.

==Hartwell House==
Hartwell House in the village is a grade I listed building in a 90-acre park, part of the Hartwell Estate owned by the Ernest Cook Trust. The house was once the residence of the exiled future king of France Louis XVIII. Since 2008 it has been leased to The National Trust and is run as a hotel by an independent company, Historic House Hotels Ltd.

==Bugle Quarry==

Bugle Quarry is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, which has yielded important fossils from the Jurassic and Cretaceous, including dinosaur teeth.

==Greyhound track==
A greyhound racing track called the Aylesbury and District Greyhound Racing Track, was opened on Saturday 24 June 1933. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The venue was owned by Ivor Richings, the landlord of the Bugle Horn and Mr Dutch from Watford. It consisted of a grandstand with totalisator and refreshment bars and racing was held three times a week. The track closed in 1942 when it was used to house Italian prisoners of war captured in North Africa.

<text>Madeline Gleason (January 26, 1903 – April 22, 1979) was a United States poet, dramatist, and founder of the San Francisco Poetry Guild. In 1947, she became the director of the first poetry festival in the United States, laying the groundwork (along with other figures such as Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Duncan, William Everson, Jack Spicer, James Broughton, et al.) for what became known as the San Francisco Renaissance. She was, with Helen Adam, Barbara Guest, and Denise Levertov, one of only four women whose work was included in Donald Allen&#x27;s landmark anthology, &quot;The New American Poetry 1945-1960&quot; (1960).

==Early life and work==
Gleason was born in Fargo, North Dakota and was the only child of Catholic parents. She attended the Catholic parish school, where she was viewed as something of a problem child. She and a cousin toured the Midwest, singing and tap-dancing in vaudeville shows.

When her mother died, she and her father moved to Portland, Oregon, where she started working in a bookstore and wrote poetry which she circulated in manuscript form. She published a series of articles on poetry and poets in a local newspaper.

==San Francisco==
In 1934, Gleason moved to San Francisco, California to work on a history of California for the WPA Writer&#x27;s Project. Two years later, a sequence of her poems was published in &quot;Poetry&quot;. For a number of years, she worked with the composer John Edmunds, translating songs by Schumann, Schubert and J. S. Bach. The pair also organised song festivals.

Her first book, &quot;Poems&quot;, was published in 1944. By this time, she had moved to Phoenix, Arizona because of the war, but she soon returned to San Francisco and took up a job with a brokerage firm.

==San Francisco Renaissance==
In April 1947, Gleason organized the First Festival of Modern Poetry at Marcelle Labaudt&#x27;s Lucien Labaudt Gallery, 1407 Gough Street, San Francisco. Gleason had roots in the Berkeley Renaissance, and so could provide the framework for an initial (and sanctioned) gathering of voices who inspired a generation.

In the space of two evenings, with twelve poets, including William Everson, Muriel Rukeyser, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer, Madeline Gleason read and performed for an audience of young poets and poetry lovers. This was the beginning of another movement, at least in the public&#x27;s eye, that would coalesce in San Francisco on October 7, 1955—at the Six Gallery on Fillmore Street—with Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;, a Reading that has gone down in history as the moment of conception of the Beat movement.

==Later life and works==
Gleason&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Metaphysical Needle&quot; appeared in 1949, but her third, &quot;Concerto for Bell and Telephone&quot;, was not published until 1966. Although she had continued with writing and involvement in the San Francisco artistic scene, as well as writing a number of plays, Gleason had, to some extent, become a victim of the Renaissance&#x27;s success. The Beat poets she had helped promote had become so successful that it was hard for less high-profile poets to find publishers.

However, she continued to give readings and taught creative writing classes, both at San Francisco State University and in her home. In 1973, her &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published, followed in 1975 by &quot;Here Comes Everybody: New and Selected Poems&quot;. Gleason continued writing right up to her death. Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published in 1999.

<doc id="412200" wikidata="Q209921" url="?curid=412200" title="Julius Erving">
<text>Julius Winfield Erving II (born February 22, 1950), commonly known by the nickname Dr. J, is an American former professional basketball player. Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association (ABA), and he was the best-known player in that league when it merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the 1975–1976 season.

Erving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player awards and three scoring titles with the ABA&#x27;s Virginia Squires and New York Nets (now the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers. During his 16 seasons as a player, none of his teams ever missed the postseason. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined). He was well known for slam dunking from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA. The basketball slang of being posterized was first coined to describe his moves. In 1980, Erving was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team. In 1993, Erving was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1994, Erving was named by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. In both 1996 and 2021, Erving was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams, respectively.

Many consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game&#x27;s best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, &quot;Jumping&quot; Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving&#x27;s time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream. His signature was the slam dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the crossover dribble and the no look pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men, usually standing close to the hoop, to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game; however, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a show of force helped to make the shot an acceptable tactic, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot. Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation and a way to fire up a team and spectators, Erving demonstrated that there can be great artistry and grace in slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.

==Early life==
Erving was born February 22, 1950, in East Meadow, on Long Island, and raised from the age of 13 in Roosevelt, New York. Prior to that, he lived in nearby Hempstead. He attended Roosevelt High School and played for its basketball team. He received the nickname &quot;Doctor&quot; or &quot;Dr. J&quot; from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains: &quot;I started calling [Saunders] &#x27;the professor&#x27; and he started calling me &#x27;the doctor&#x27;. So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames. ... And that&#x27;s where it came from.&quot;

Erving recalled that &quot;later on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me &#x27;Black Moses&#x27; and &#x27;Houdini&#x27;, I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me &#x27;Doctor&#x27;&quot;. Over time, the nickname evolved into &quot;Dr. Julius&quot; and finally &quot;Dr. J.&quot; Erving was first called &quot;Dr. J&quot; by his friend and future teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner.

==College career and Team USA==

Erving enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1968. In two varsity college basketball seasons, he averaged 26.3 points and 20.2 rebounds per game, becoming one of only six players to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball. In 1968, the NCAA adopted a rule that prohibited dunking. Thus, Erving&#x27;s dunking was only seen and known to teammates at practice.

Fifteen years later, Erving fulfilled a promise he had made to his mother by earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in creative leadership and administration from the school through the University Without Walls program. Erving also holds an honorary doctorate from UMass. In September 2021, Massachusetts honored Erving by unveiling a statue outside the Mullins Center on the university&#x27;s campus.

In the year 1970, Erving also played for the United States Olympic Development Team as an aim to qualify for the Olympic team in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Erving, wearing the jersey number six, played power forward and was recruited to be the team&#x27;s top rebounder. He ended up being the top vote-getter for Most Valuable Player or MVP, a top scorer for Team USA, and successfully competed against adult professional players from Russia, Finland, and other European countries alongside teammates Bob Nash and Paul Westphal. It was around this time Erving started hearing talks among his teammates of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and its novel goal to recruit undergraduates as a plan to compete with the National Basketball Association. After a meeting with ABA general manager Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Kerr and future coach Al Bianchi, he then decided to inform his mother that he will join the ABA in late 1971 while staying in a hotel in Philadelphia talking with a double agent named Steve Arnold. This became a subject of litigation for Erving&#x27;s NBA rights to play for the Atlanta Hawks in the next year.

==Professional career==
===Virginia Squires (1971–1973)===
Although NBA rules at the time did not allow teams to draft players who were fewer than four years removed from high school, the ABA instituted a “hardship” rule that would allow players to leave college early. Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires. However, the Squires were forced to forfeit their first round pick in the 1972 ABA draft in order for the ABA to allow this move on their end, later being one of four ABA teams to relinquish their first round draft pick rights during that year&#x27;s draft period.

Erving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team.

===ABA–NBA contract dispute===
Under NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round (12th overall), a move that would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus. The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms. He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract.

This created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks&#x27; training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving&#x27;s rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy&#x27;s decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks’ position. While waiting for the owners’ decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich.

On October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitration because of an arbitration clause in Erving&#x27;s contract with Virginia. He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court.

Back in the ABA, his game flourished and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972–1973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets.

===New York Nets (1973–1976)===

The Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft.

Erving went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973–1974, defeating the Utah Stars. Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA and brought fans and credibility to the league.
The end of the 1975–76 ABA season finally brought the ABA–NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson free agency suit (which was not resolved until 1976). The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the ABA&#x27;s final championship. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made. This is the only season in the ABA or the NBA where such a feat was accomplished.

===Philadelphia 76ers (1976–1987)===
The Nets, Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and San Antonio Spurs joined the NBA for the 1976–1977 season. With Erving and Nate Archibald (acquired in a trade with Kansas City), the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets&#x27; plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for &quot;invading&quot; the Knicks&#x27; NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving&#x27;s salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp.

After several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving&#x27;s contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history. The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving&#x27;s contract for $3 million—in addition to paying roughly the Nets same amount as their expansion fee—and Boe had little choice but to accept the $6 million deal. For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22–60 record, the worst in the league. Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving to join the NBA, saying, &quot;The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise.&quot;

Erving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with other stars-such as former ABA standout George McGinnis, future NBA All-Star Lloyd Free and aggressive Doug Collins allowed him to focus on playing more team-oriented ball. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. They defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2–0 lead, however, the Blazers ran off four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers&#x27; team.
Erving enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;. In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually, coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful.

The Sixers were still eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics–76ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1985. The Bird vs. Erving matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. Magic Johnson), inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game &quot;One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird&quot;. In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary &quot;Baseline Move&quot;, a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won the series 4–2 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson. Erving also made the only three point shot in that NBA Finals series, which was the first time the three point line was introduced in the league.

Erving was again among the league&#x27;s best players in the 1980–1981 and 1981–1982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in seven games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3–1 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1; and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in seven games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.

For the 1982–1983 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of &quot;fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)&quot; in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title. In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title.
Erving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1 and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons. In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game he would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.

===Retirement===

Erving retired in 1987 at the age of 37. Johnny Kerr told ABA historian Terry Pluto: &quot;A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night.&quot; He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving&#x27;s acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA&#x27;s scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.

In his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and in 1996 he was inducted into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top five in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. , Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Dirk Nowitzki and Wilt Chamberlain.

==Legacy==
===1976 ABA Slam Dunk Contest===

In this memorable contest, Erving faced George &quot;The Iceman&quot; Gervin, All-Star and former teammate Larry &quot;Special K&quot; Kenon, MVP Artis &quot;The A-Train&quot; Gilmore and David &quot;The Skywalker&quot; Thompson. Erving started by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he performed a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He ran to the opposite end of the court and back and dunked the basketball from the free throw line. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players (Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk from the foul line to a wider audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game Slam Dunk Contest.

===Dunk over Bill Walton===
This event transpired during game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders, seemingly gliding to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton&#x27;s outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted, considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.

===Baseline move===
One of his most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard. He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7′2″ center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;The, No Way, even for Dr. J, Flying Reverse Lay-up&quot;. Dr. J called it &quot;just another move&quot;.

===&quot;Rock the Baby&quot; dunk over Michael Cooper===
Another of Erving&#x27;s most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard Maurice Cheeks deflected a pass by Lakers forward James Worthy, Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court&#x27;s left side, with one defender to beat—the Lakers&#x27; top defender Michael Cooper. As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a &quot;Rock the Baby&quot; slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.

==Post-basketball career==

Erving earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1986 through the University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and doing work as a television analyst. In 1997, he joined the front office of the Orlando Magic as Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President.

Erving and former NFL running back Joe Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000, becoming the first ever NASCAR racing team at any level owned completely by minorities. The team had secure sponsorship from Dr Pepper for most of its existence. Erving, a racing fan himself, stated that his foray into NASCAR was an attempt to raise interest in NASCAR among African-Americans. He has also served on the Board of Directors of Converse (prior to their 2001 bankruptcy), Darden Restaurants, Saks Incorporated and The Sports Authority. As of 2009, Erving was the owner of &quot;The Celebrity Golf Club International&quot; outside of Atlanta, but the club was forced to file for bankruptcy soon after. He was ranked by ESPN as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.

In 1991 he performed the narration in a performance of Copland&#x27;s Lincoln Portrait with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in a concert to honor the 62nd birthday of the late Martin Luther King Jr. The concert was broadcast and is available on YouTube.

Erving made a cameo appearance in the 1993 movie &quot;Philadelphia&quot; starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington and in the sitcom &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; in 1995. He appeared as The Minister in the 2012 remake of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; for Lifetime television. He also made a cameo appearance as himself in &quot;Lice&quot;, the tenth episode of the ninth season of the comedy series &quot;The Office&quot; (2013). Erving appeared as himself in the 2022 movie &quot;Hustle&quot; starring Adam Sandler and Juancho Hernangómez.

==Personal life==
Erving is a Christian. He has spoken about his faith, saying: &quot;After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.&quot; Erving is a second cousin of economist Walter E. Williams. Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond.

In 1979, Erving began an affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of Alexandra Stevenson, who would become a professional tennis player. Although Erving&#x27;s fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter; however, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship. Erving met Stevenson for the first time on October 31, 2008. In 2009, Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches.

In 1988, Erving received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2003, Erving fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, with a woman named Dorýs Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced and Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had three more children, Jules Erving and two others including Julieta who was born in 2005. They married in 2008 and moved from St. George, Utah to Buckhead, Atlanta in Georgia in 2009 while managing their Atlanta golf and country club.

On September 10, 2021, Erving attended an unveiling ceremony at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for statues honoring himself and fellow UMass alumni and Basketball Hall of Fame members John Calipari, Marcus Camby and Jack Leaman. The ceremony was attended by former teammates, coaches, family and current players of the UMass men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams.

== Community art ==

The Dr. J mural is located on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA.

From Mural Arts Philadelphia:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&quot;Feeling restless and desperate to improve the quality and variety of the murals, Jane [Golden] made a decision in 1990 that would forever change Mural Arts Philadelphia. She raised money from private foundation to bring her old friend and mentor Kent Twitchell to Philadelphia. She wanted a “breakthrough mural,” and Twitchell—a nationally acclaimed California artist—was just the man to paint it. “We knew we had to push the boundaries,” she said. &quot;The goal was to try to integrate superior artwork with a subject that touched the community in a special way.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Twitchell was known for his portraits and he lobbied to paint basketball great Julius Erving in a business suit instead of a uniform to portray him more as a man and role model than simply another well-known athlete. The dignified, full-length portrait is so tall that Erving&#x27;s head just fits under the peak of the three-story building. The image was first painted on large squares of parachute cloth, which were then adhered to the wall surface with acrylic gel. The cloth&#x27;s smooth surface allowed Twitchell to craft Erving with uncannily realistic detail, from the crease in his tan suit trousers to the gold bracelet on his right hand. Local residents, who maintain a small park in front of the mural, claim that the real Dr. J had tears in his eyes when he saw the completed portrait for the first time. Dr. J is also the only Philadelphia mural so respected that it appears in homage in another mural, the student-painted panorama of urban life on the Spring Garden Street Bridge.&quot;

&quot;The mural was universally applauded. It showed that murals have the potential to be great. The level of expectation was raised,” Jane said. The mural helped alter public opinion about the program, too. “The art snobs, people who&#x27;d been looking down at our murals, started to change. There was a ripple effect—foundation and grants started to emerge.&quot;
