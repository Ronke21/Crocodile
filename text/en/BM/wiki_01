<text>In music, heterophony is a type of texture characterized by the simultaneous variation of a single melodic line. Such a texture can be regarded as a kind of complex monophony in which there is only one basic melody, but realized at the same time in multiple voices, each of which plays the melody differently, either in a different rhythm or tempo, or with various embellishments and elaborations. The term was initially introduced into systematic musicology to denote a subcategory of polyphonic music, though is now regarded as a textural category in its own right.

== Characteristics ==
Heterophony is often a characteristic feature of non-Western traditional musics—for example Ottoman classical music, Arabic classical music, Japanese Gagaku, the gamelan music of Indonesia, kulintang ensembles of the Philippines, and the traditional music of Thailand. In European traditions, there are also some examples of heterophony. One such example is dissonant heterophony of Dinaric Ganga or &quot;Ojkavica&quot; traditions from southern Bosnia, Croatia and Montenegro that is attributed to ancient Illyrian tradition. 
Another remarkably vigorous European tradition of heterophonic music exists, in the form of Outer Hebridean Gaelic psalmody.

David Morton describes the texture in Thai music:

Thai music is nonharmonic, melodic, or linear, and as is the case with all musics of this genre, its fundamental organization is &quot;horizontal&quot;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Thai music in its horizontal complex is made up of a main melody played simultaneously with variants of it which progress in relatively slower and faster rhythmic units... Individual lines of melody and variants sound in unison or octaves only at specific structural points, and the simultaneity of different pitches does not follow the Western system of organized chord progressions. Between the structural points where the pitches coincide (unison or octaves) each individual line follows the style idiomatic for the instrument playing it. The vertical complex at any given intermediary point follows no set progression; the linear adherence to style regulates. Thus several pitches that often create a highly complex simultaneous structure may occur at any point between the structural pitches. The music &quot;breathes&quot; by contracting to one pitch, then expanding to a wide variety of pitches, then contracting again to another structural pitch, and so on throughout. Though these complexes of pitches between structural points may strike the Western listener as arbitrary and inconsequential, the individual lines are highly consequential and logical &quot;linearly&quot;. The pattern of pitches occurring at these structural points is the basis of the modal aspect of Thai music.

He goes on to suggest the term &quot;polyphonic stratification&quot;, rather than &quot;heterophony&quot;:

The technique of combining simultaneously one main melody and its variants is often incorrectly described as heterophony: polyphonic stratification seems a more precise description, since each of the &#x27;layers&#x27; is not just a close approximation of the main melody, but also has distinct characteristics and a style of its own

== Examples ==

Heterophony is somewhat rare in Western Classical music prior to the twentieth century. There are examples to be found in some works of J.S. Bach:

as well as Mozart: and Mahler: 

In the 20th century, Benjamin Britten used heterophony to great effect in many pieces, including parts of the &quot;War Requiem&quot; and especially in the instrumental interludes of his three church parables: &quot;Curlew River&quot;, &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;. Peter Evans explains it as follows: &quot;So unexpectedly stark were the sounds Britten drew from this group, and in particular so little dependent of his familiar harmonic propulsion, that listeners were ready to trace direct exotic influences in many features of the score.&quot; Other examples include Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Rituel&quot;, &quot;Répons&quot;, and &quot;…explosante-fixe…&quot;.

Heterophony is a key element in the music of Canadian composer Jose Evangelista.

<text>In music, texture is how the tempo and the melodic and harmonic materials are combined in a musical composition, determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. The texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see Common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many &#x27;layers&#x27; of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section or another brass. The thickness also is changed by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A piece&#x27;s texture may be changed by the number and character of parts playing at once, the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, tempo, and rhythms used. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody (PM), secondary melody (SM), parallel supporting melody (PSM), static support (SS), harmonic support (HS), rhythmic support (RS), and harmonic and rhythmic support (HRS).

==Common types==
In musical terms, particularly in the fields of music history and music analysis, some common terms for different types of texture are:


Many classical pieces feature different kinds of texture within a short space of time. An example is the Scherzo from Schubert’s piano sonata in B major, D575. The first four bars are monophonic, with both hands performing the same melody an octave apart:

Bars 5–10 are homophonic, with all voices coinciding rhythmically:

Bars 11–20 are polyphonic. There are three parts, the top two moving in parallel (interval of a tenth). The lowest part imitates the rhythm of the upper two at the distance of three beats. The passage climaxes abruptly with a bar’s silence: 

After the silence, the polyphonic texture expands from three to four independent parts moving simultaneously in bars 21–24. The upper two parts are imitative, the lowest part consists of a repeated note (pedal point) and the remaining part weaves an independent melodic line: 

The final four bars revert to homophony, bringing the section to a close; A complete performance can be heard by following this link: Listen

==Additional types==
Although in music instruction certain styles or repertoires of music are often identified with one of these descriptions this is basically added music (for example, Gregorian chant is described as monophonic, Bach Chorales are described as homophonic and fugues as polyphonic), many composers use more than one type of texture in the same piece of music.

A simultaneity is more than one complete musical texture occurring at the same time, rather than in succession.

A more recent type of texture first used by György Ligeti is micropolyphony. Other textures include polythematic, polyrhythmic, onomatopoeic, compound, and mixed or composite textures.

<doc id="410851" wikidata="Q813690" url="?curid=410851" title="Kegel exercise">
<text>Kegel exercise, also known as pelvic floor exercise, involves repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor, now sometimes colloquially referred to as the &quot;Kegel muscles&quot;. The exercise can be performed many times a day, for several minutes at a time but takes one to three months to begin to have an effect.

Kegel exercises aim to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. These muscles have many functions within the human body. In women, they are responsible for holding up the bladder, preventing urinary stress incontinence (especially after childbirth), vaginal and uterine prolapse. In men, these muscles are responsible for urinary continence, fecal continence, and ejaculation. Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises.

The American gynecologist Arnold Kegel first published a description of such exercises in 1948.

==Mechanism of action==
Kegel exercises aim to improve muscle tone by strengthening the pubococcygeus muscles of the pelvic floor. Kegel is a popular prescribed exercise for pregnant women to prepare the pelvic floor for physiological stresses of the later stages of pregnancy and childbirth. Various advisors recommend Kegel exercises for treating vaginal prolapse and preventing uterine prolapse in women and for treating prostate pain and swelling resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis in men. Kegel exercises may have benefits in treating urinary incontinence in both men and women. Kegel exercises may also increase sexual gratification, allowing women to complete pompoir and aiding men in reducing premature ejaculation. The many actions performed by Kegel muscles include holding in urine and avoiding defecation. Reproducing this type of muscle action can strengthen the Kegel muscles. The action of slowing or stopping the flow of urine may be used as a test of the correct pelvic-floor exercise technique.

The components of levator ani (the pelvic diaphragm), namely pubococcygeus, puborectalis and iliococcygeus, contract and relax as one muscle. Hence pelvic-floor exercises involve the entire levator ani rather than pubococcygeus alone. Pelvic floor exercises may help in cases of fecal incontinence and in pelvic organ prolapse conditions e.g. rectal prolapse.

==Health effects==
=== Women ===
Factors such as pregnancy, childbirth, aging, and being overweight often weaken the pelvic muscles. This can be assessed by either digital examination of vaginal pressure or using a Kegel perineometer. Kegel exercises are useful in regaining pelvic floor muscle strength in such cases.

The symptoms of prolapse and its severity can be decreased with pelvic floor exercises. Effectiveness can be improved with feedback on how to do the exercises.

=== Men ===
Kegel exercises can train the perineal muscles by increasing the oxygen supply and the strength of those muscles. The names of the perineal muscles are: ischiocavernosus (erection), bulbocavernosus (ejaculation), external sphincter of the anus, striated urethral sphincter, transverse perineal, levator of the prostate, and puborectalis.

Premature ejaculation is defined as when male ejaculation occurs after less than one minute of penetration. The perineal muscles are involved in ejaculation when they are involuntarily contracted. The ischiocavernosus muscle is responsible for male erection, and the bulbocavernosus muscle is responsible for ejaculation. By actively contracting the perineal muscles with Kegel exercises regularly, strength and control of these muscles increase, possibly aiding in the avoidance of premature ejaculation.

=== Urinary incontinence ===
Pelvic floor exercises (muscle training) can be included in conservative treatment approaches for women with urinary incontinence. There is tentative evidence that biofeedback may give added benefit when used with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). There is no clear evidence that teaching pelvic floor exercises alters the risk of stress urinary incontinence in men that develop this condition post prostatectomy.

In pregnant women, antenatal PFMT probably helps prevent urinary continence during pregnancy and up to six months after giving birth but for pregnant women who already have incontinence, it is not clear if antenatal PFMT helps to reduce symptoms.

===Fecal incontinence===
In pregnancy, it is not yet clear if antenatal PFMT helps to prevent or treat fecal incontinence.

==Pelvic toning devices==
Some devices, marketed to women, are for exercising the pelvic floor muscles and to improve the muscle tone of the pubococcygeal or vaginal muscle.

As of 2013, there was no evidence that doing pelvic floor exercise with weights worked better than doing Kegel exercises without weights; there is greater risk with weights, because a foreign object is introduced into the vagina.

===Marketing===
During the latter part of the 20th century, a number of medical and pseudo-medical devices were marketed to consumers as improving sexual performance or orgasms, increasing &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;balancing hormones&quot;, and as having other health or lifestyle benefits. There is no evidence for any of these claims, and many of them are pseudoscience.

<text>Humanity+ (also Humanity Plus; formerly the World Transhumanist Association) is a non-profit international educational organization that advocates the ethical use of technologies and evidence-based science to improve the human condition.

==History==

Humanity+, Inc. originated as an organization under the name World Transhumanist Association. In 1998, the World Transhumanist Association (WTA) was founded by Nick Bostrom and David Pearce. In 2002, it was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. WTA began working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy, and to add to the academic presence already created by Extropy Institute in the fields of computer science, AI, nanotechnology, and philosophy.

At its inception, WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed. A particular concern is the equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders. To increase longevity and boost physiological processes, this also involves targeted improvements and therapeutic interventions. Cochlear implants and genetic engineering are two examples of medical innovations, as are wearable technology like smart phones. In opposition to anthropocentric hegemony and in favor of the appropriate application of technology to maximize human potential, Humanity+ encourages knowledge of and respect for the diversity of life forms on Earth.

In 2006, William Saletan reported a political struggle within World Transhumanist Association that erupted in 2004 largely between the libertarian right and the liberal left resulting in a centre-leftward positioning that continued to polarize politics under its former executive director James Hughes.

== &quot;Better Than Well&quot; ==
The field of medicine is always developing, improving human health in addition to curing diseases and wounds. Although there are no intrinsic problems with trying to get better, there are ethical issues to consider. Promoting health and responsible technology use are top priorities for Humanity+. Members practice mental health techniques like meditation, wellness diets, and physical activity. They also stress self-responsibility, empathy, and charity and take part in initiatives like Quantified Self.

<text>In music, monody refers to a solo vocal style distinguished by having a single melodic line and instrumental accompaniment. Although such music is found in various cultures throughout history, the term is specifically applied to Italian song of the early 17th century, particularly the period from about 1600 to 1640. The term is used both for the style and for individual songs (so one can speak both of monody as a whole as well as a particular monody). The term itself is a recent invention of scholars. No composer of the 17th century ever called a piece a monody. Compositions in monodic form might be called madrigals, motets, or even concertos (in the earlier sense of &quot;concertato&quot;, meaning &quot;with instruments&quot;).

In poetry, the term monody has become specialized to refer to a poem in which one person laments another&#x27;s death. (In the context of ancient Greek literature, monody, , could simply refer to lyric poetry sung by a single performer, rather than by a chorus.)
==History==
Musical monody, which developed out of an attempt by the Florentine Camerata in the 1580s to restore ancient Greek practices of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy), one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable ornamentation, over a rhythmically independent bass line. Accompanying instruments could be lute, chitarrone, theorbo, harpsichord, organ, and even on occasion guitar. While some monodies were arrangements for smaller forces of the music for large ensembles which was common at the end of the 16th century, especially in the Venetian School, most monodies were composed independently. The development of monody was one of the defining characteristics of early Baroque practice, as opposed to late Renaissance style, in which groups of voices sang independently and with a greater balance between parts.

Contrasting passages in monodies could be for the most part melodic or for the most part declamatory and the two styles of presentation developed into the aria and the recitative respectively, both of which came to be incorporated into the cantata by about 1635.

The parallel development of solo song with accompaniment in France was called the &quot;air de cour&quot;: the term monody is not normally applied to these more conservative songs, however, which retained many musical characteristics of the Renaissance &quot;chanson&quot;.

An important early treatise on monody is contained in Giulio Caccini&#x27;s song collection, &quot;Le nuove musiche&quot; (Florence, 1601).

<doc id="410858" wikidata="Q85779567" url="?curid=410858" title="List of fire-retardant materials">
<text>Fire-retardant materials are designed to burn slowly.

Fire-retardant materials should not be confused with &quot;fire-resistant&quot; materials. A fire resistant material is one which is designed to resist burning and withstand heat. An example of a fire-resistant material is one which is used in bunker gear worn by firefighters to protect them from the flames of a burning building.

In the United Kingdom, after two significant construction fires which resulted in a combined loss of £1,500 million, &quot;The Joint Code of Practice&quot; was introduced by the Fire Protection Association (FPA), the UK&#x27;s national fire safety organisation, to prevent fires on buildings undergoing construction work. The Joint Code of Practice provides advice on how to prevent fires such as through the use of flame-retardant temporary protection materials: for example, some high quality floor protectors are designed to burn slowly and prevent the spread of fires.

==Fire-retardant materials used in buildings==
*Iron
*Mineral wool
*Gypsum boards
*Asbestos cement
*Perlite boards
*Calcium silicate 
*Sodium silicate
*Potassium silicate 
*Treated lumber plywood
*Treated vegetable fiber (e.g., cotton, jute, kenaf, hemp, flax, etc..)
*Fire-retardant treated wood
*Brick
*Concrete
*Cement render
*Intumescent paint
*Glass
*Magnesium oxide (MgO)
*Geobond asbestos substitute

==Fire textiles==
*PBI
*Aramid - para and meta
*Flame retardant cotton
*Coated nylon
*Carbon foam (CFOAM)
*Melamine
*Modacrylic

==Phasing-out==
Many common brominated flame retardants are being phased-out by manufacturers. Asbestos is another fireproofing material that has been largely phased out, due to its health risks, including asbestosis and mesothelioma.

<text>Plan Kathleen, sometimes referred to as the Artus Plan, was a military plan for the invasion of Northern Ireland by Nazi Germany, sanctioned in 1940 by Stephen Hayes, Acting Irish Republican Army (IRA) Chief of Staff.

Plan Kathleen is distinct from Operation Green, the German military plan to invade Ireland, also drawn up in 1940.

==Immediate context==
Kathleen took place in the context of then IRA chief of staff, Seán Russell, being &quot;incommunicado&quot; in the United States as he pursued the propaganda arm of the S-Plan. Russell was attempting to arrange passage to Berlin (see Operation Dove), having left Stephen Hayes as Acting Chief of Staff back in Ireland.

While Russell&#x27;s movements were unknown to Hayes, he sanctioned the drawing up an invasion plan to end partition and reunify the island of Ireland. The plan was written by an IRA volunteer called Liam Gaynor.

Gaynor created the plan in early 1940, sometime before it was decided to send the plan to Nazi Germany via courier. Hayes had a couple of reasons for doing this; he wanted German assistance for IRA operations in Ireland, and he wanted to re-establish the IRA link with German Intelligence (&quot;Abwehr&quot;) to secure arms and money.

The courier for transporting the plan to Germany was a Dublin businessman Stephen Carroll Held whose step-father Michael Held had German-Swiss heritage.

Held left for Germany and arrived on 20 April 1940. His first call was to the door of the first &quot;Abwehr&quot; contact in Ireland, Oscar Pfaus. Pfaus then took Held to Berlin to meet with Abwehr Section-Leader Kurt Haller. Held was instructed to produce a previous agreed means of identification that would prove that he was an emissary sent by the IRA. During this first meeting, he did not meet Hermann Görtz, an &quot;Abwehr&quot; agent who was preparing to leave for Ireland, but he was introduced to him later. It is thought that Held met Görtz on a later occasion in Frankfurt in 1940.

Due to his nervousness, the &quot;Abwehr&quot; were suspicious and they found the plan he carried extremely amateurish.

His mission complete (delivering the plan and an invitation from Hayes for a German officer to be sent to Ireland), Held returned to Ireland two days later. The &quot;Abwehr&quot; II war diary briefly records the entire incident beginning 20 April 1940:

&quot;A personal emissary of the chief Irish agent (Jim (Seamus) O&#x27;Donovan) has arrived in Germany.&quot;

Then on 24 April:

&quot;The representative sent from Ireland to Germany on behalf of Abwehr II&#x27;s chief Irish agent departed according to plan on April 23 for Belgium by secret route.&quot;

==Details of Plan Kathleen==

According to Görtz, Kathleen consisted of a map, on which was the suggestion of a German landing similar to that at Narvik, in the vicinity of Derry — an amphibious assault. The aim of the plan was the conquest of Northern Ireland via a simultaneous IRA insurgency and use of German forces. Other places German soldiers would be landed include Coleraine, Larne and Sligo. The IRA were to be concentrated in County Leitrim, on the border facing Lough Erne and Upper Lough Erne awaiting the arrival of German forces in Northern Ireland.

However, the IRA plan gave no thought to how German troops were to be brought to Derry, how control of the sea approaches was to be obtained or where and how the coast of Northern Ireland was fortified. Görtz described the plan at the time and its limitations thus: &quot;The plan was therefore completely useless. It nearly broke my heart, since it came from the IRA Chief of Staff.&quot;

Hull in &quot;Irish Secrets&quot; describes the plan so:

The plan envisaged a landing in the neighbourhood of Derry (in the manner of Narvik Operation Weserübung) and a successful conquest of Ulster with assistance from the IRA. The IRA planned a ground offensive beginning in County Leitrim with a front on the Lower and Upper Lough Erne which would, somehow, lead to the destruction of all British forces in Northern Ireland. The bait for the Germans was supposed to be the change of neutralising the RAF&#x27;s use of Lough Erne as a tactical base against the U-boat fleet. The plan called for the deployment of 50,000 German troops.&quot;

It is accepted that the plan was poorly constructed and not treated with any seriousness by the &quot;Abwehr&quot; or German Foreign Ministry, although at this stage they did not yet recognise the IRA as &quot;hopelessly immature&quot;. In so much as the plan was considered, it was considered a measure of IRA intent — willingness to assist. It is not known whether any serious planning was done around Kathleen, although the plan appears to have been widened in scope, maybe by Görtz, or perhaps Kurt Student, who presented a similar plan to Hitler in January 1941, to include parachute drops of German troops around Divis Mountain and Lisburn in combination with the amphibious assault on Lough Swilly and Magilligan Point.

==Aftermath of Kathleen==
Plan Kathleen was sent to Germany in April 1940, and arrived around two weeks before Görtz was to parachute into Ireland as part of Operation Mainau on 5 May. Before his departure, Görtz was instructed to begin contact with the IRA, assess the strength of the IRA and the feasibility of the plan. He did discuss the plan and strength of the IRA with Hayes upon his arrival in Ireland.

By the time of these discussions, Russell was still alive, he had arrived in Berlin the day Görtz left although they did not speak together.

The discussions Görtz had with Hayes were entirely unproductive. Hayes and Görtz&#x27;s had begun their negotiations on 17 May, meeting in the home of Stephen Held. Prior to this Görtz had probably already met with Seamus O&#x27;Donovan who had briefed him on the state of the IRA. At this meeting Hayes listed the strength of the IRA, which Görtz reported as &quot;5000 sworn in members, of whom 1500 [are in] Northern Ireland. Hayes counts on a further 10,000 Northern Irish and 15,000 Southern Irish in the case of an armed revolt in Northern Ireland&quot;. However, Görtz expressed disappointment with Hayes:
&quot;I do not think it is necessary for me to describe the disappointment which I felt when I met Stephen Hayes, although I had already been warned. I expected someone like Léon Degrelle [leader of the Belgian Rexists] or like the leaders of the Breton independence movement, or the Ukrainian leaders with whom I had become acquainted in Berlin. Hayes was an ex-footballer. At first he showed himself as a man of good personal qualities but that is not enough for the leader of nationalist extremists. Later his character deteriorated. I think from alcohol and fear.&quot;

At this meeting, Görtz claims that he directed Hayes to cease operations in Éire and instead concentrate operations on Northern Ireland. Görtz reports that Hayes said he would issue orders to that effect. Hayes is also reported to have said that the Irish Government had made contact with him via a priest, &quot;Father O&#x27;Hara&quot;, with a view to incorporating the IRA within the Irish Defence Forces.

Görtz reports that Kathleen was discussed:
&quot;We discussed the plan of a German invasion of Ulster on the basis of ′Plan Kathleen′ which Held had brought to Germany. I did not tell Hayes what I really thought about the plan but used the discussion about it only as a pretext to learn something about the real strength and state of readiness of the IRA. I said that the plan was the subject of a lively discussion in Germany but that one needed more military intelligence about Ulster before the plan could be executed. Thereupon Hayes asked what sort of information was needed... Hayes then told me that the IRA had no weapons for any sort of major action. When I learnt of all that was needed in the way of weapons, I wondered exactly what was the military value of the IRA. I told Hayes flatly that the landing of a consignment of arms was just as impossible on the Ulster coast as on that of Éire. The one possibility was delivery on the high seas and that would only be feasible for small quantities. Hayes jumped at this idea. I immediately regretted having spoken about this at all because my remark led to wild and fantastic IRA discussions as to which island could be used for U-boat replenishment and which impossible bogs and mountains could be used as airfields.&quot;

Görtz was to say later:
&quot;We always discussed the same things. In Ulster nothing was achieved on IRA initiative, in Éire the order to discontinue activities was not strictly obeyed.&quot;

Görtz claims that after this meeting he sat down and worked out the details of shipping and landing arms in Ireland.

==Capture of the Plan==
On 22 May 1940, Held′s house was raided and equipment brought by Görtz to Ireland including his parachute and Plan Kathleen were seized. The Garda waited for Held to arrive at the house and arrested him.

They also found, in Görtz′s room, a typewriter and a file that contained military details about Irish harbours, airfields, bridges, roads, landing places, and the distribution of Irish Defence Forces. Around the same time, the wife of Francis Stuart, Iseult Stuart (daughter of Maud Gonne) was arrested on suspicion of also harbouring &quot;Heinrich Brandy&quot;, the name Görtz was travelling under.

Plan Kathleen was blown, and the Irish authorities immediately sent it to MI5 in London who sent it to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Belfast. The details of the plan were to form the nucleus of joint Irish and British wargaming the following year, under the auspices of Plan W — the combined response to a German invasion.

Hempel would try to negate the fear generated within the Irish political establishment by the discovery of Plan Kathleen. He was instructed to do this by underscoring German offers of military assistance should Britain invade Éire.

==The Kurt Student Plan 1941==
Plan Kathleen, or a widened variant of the plan to take over Northern Ireland appears to have surfaced again in Nazi Germany during January 1941. During an audience with Hitler, General Kurt Student, commander of the German 11th Airborne Corps, discussed a plan to take over Northern Ireland and leave the territory of Éire free from, and unoccupied by, German troops.

The discussions took place at the Obersalzberg on New Year&#x27;s Day where Student was recovering from wounds received during the invasion of Holland. At this point, Hitler was still considering an invasion of Britain and it was within this context that Student suggested a diversionary paratrooper attack on Northern Ireland, to coincide with German landings on the south coast of England. Student suggested a plan whereby dummies dressed as paratroopers would also be dropped to confuse the enemy. According to Student:&quot;...an even longer discussion followed on the question of the position of the Irish Free State. Hitler stated: &#x27;Éire&#x27;s neutrality must be respected. A neutral Irish Free State is of greater value to us than a hostile Ireland. We must be glad that Ireland has remained neutral up to the present. But we could not avoid trespassing on a small scale, through units losing their way by emergency landings at night, by dropping in the wrong area.&#x27;&quot;

Student suggested the best date for the operation would be in April, on the 25th anniversary of the Easter 1916 Rising. His plan was to drop 20,000 paratroopers and 12,000 airborne troops by night on two areas of Northern Ireland. The first and larger force would land in the triangle between the northern half of Lough Neagh and Divis Mountain above Belfast, capturing the RAF fields at Aldergrove, Langford Lodge and Nutts Corner. At the same time, a second force of paratroopers would be dropped near Lisburn to destroy the planes on the Long Kesh airfield and cut road and rail links between Belfast and the south. Student&#x27;s dummies would meanwhile be dropped over the Mourne and Sperrin Mountains to add to the confusion. At daybreak, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter squadrons would then fly in from Brittany and land on the captured airfields.

Student claimed after the end of World War II that he thought the first part of the operation would have been a success, but if the landings in Britain had gone badly, he and his men would have fought through to the territory of Éire and asked to be interned rather than be captured by the British Army. Despite this sentiment, Student was unaware of the cooperation between Dublin and London around Plan W, and most likely any invasion of German forces would have triggered an invasion by the British. Hitler made no decision on the matter and Student was told the next day by &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring:&quot;Do not trouble yourself needlessly about Ulster [Northern Ireland]. The &quot;Führer&quot; does not want to invade Great Britain. From now on Gibraltar will be the main task for you.&quot;

<text>&quot;Blues Ain&#x27;t No Mocking Bird&quot; is a short story by Toni Cade Bambara written in 1971. It is told through the point of view of a young black girl in North America. The story is about a family whose privacy is invaded by two white cameramen who are making a film for the county&#x27;s food stamp program.

== Plot ==
In this story, the little girl is playing at her grandmother&#x27;s house with her cousin Cathy and her neighbors, Tyrone and Terry. Two white filmmakers, shooting a film ‘‘about food stamps’’ for the county, trespass in the girl&#x27;s yard. The little girl’s grandmother asks the filmmakers to leave but they simply move farther away. The grandmother shares a story with the children and Cathy which relates to her feeling about people filming without permission. To her, life is not to be publicized to everyone because they are not as &quot;good&quot; or wealthy as others.

The girl&#x27;s grandfather, Granddaddy Cain, returns from hunting a chicken hawk. He nails the female hawk, alive and flapping, to the wall. When its mate comes after it, Grandaddy Cain kills it with his hammer flung up at it. Granddaddy then takes the camera from the men and tears the film out of it. The filmmakers swear and exit the premises. Cathy, the cousin of the little girl, displays a precocious ability to interpret other people’s actions and words as well as an interest in storytelling and writing. At the end of the story, Cathy decides to write a story based on what happened that day. She says she’ll call it “The Proper Use of the Hammer.” It’s unclear if she has fully understood the events. 

The reader may notice the nonstandard spellings of words such as &#x27;mockin&#x27; (&#x27;mocking&#x27;) or &#x27;nuthin&#x27; (&#x27;nothing&#x27;) as the story is written in a variety of African-American English.

== Publication ==
The story was first published in 1971 as part of the author&#x27;s book &quot;Gorilla, My Love,&quot; which is a collection of short stories.

<doc id="410866" wikidata="Q1049655" url="?curid=410866" title="Paraplegia">
<text>Paraplegia, or paraparesis, is an impairment in motor or sensory function of the lower extremities. The word comes from Ionic Greek ()
&quot;half-stricken&quot;. It is usually caused by spinal cord injury or a congenital condition that affects the neural (brain) elements of the spinal canal. The area of the spinal canal that is affected in paraplegia is either the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. If four limbs are affected by paralysis, tetraplegia or quadriplegia is the correct term. If only one limb is affected, the correct term is monoplegia. Spastic paraplegia is a form of paraplegia defined by spasticity of the affected muscles, rather than flaccid paralysis.

The American Spinal Injury Association classifies spinal cord injury severity in the following manner. ASIA A is the complete loss of sensory function and motor skills below the injury. ASIA B is having some sensory function below the injury, but no motor function. In ASIA C, there is some motor function below the level of injury, but half of the muscles cannot move against gravity. In ASIA D, more than half of the muscles below the level of injury can move against gravity. ASIA E is the restoration of all neurologic function.

Individuals with paraplegia can range in their level of disability, requiring treatments to vary from case to case. Rehabilitation aims to help the patient regain as much functionality and independence as possible. Physiotherapy may help to improve strength, range of motion, stretching and transfer skills. Most paraplegics will be reliant on a wheelchair as a mode of transportation. Activities of daily living (ADLs) can be quite challenging at first for those with a spinal cord injury (SCI). With the aid of physiotherapists and occupational therapists, individuals with an SCI can learn new skills and adapt previous ones to maximize independence, often living independently within the community.

===Regeneration of the spinal cord===

Olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) have been transplanted with success into the spinal cord of a Polish man named Darek Fidyka, who was the survivor of a knife attack that left him paraplegic in 2010.

In 2014, Fidyka underwent pioneering spinal surgery that used nerve grafts, from his ankle, to &#x27;bridge the gap&#x27; in his severed spinal cord and OEC&#x27;s to stimulate the spinal cord cells. The surgery was performed in Poland in collaboration with Prof. Geoff Raisman, chair of neural regeneration at University College London&#x27;s Institute of Neurology, and his research team. The olfactory cells were taken from the patient&#x27;s olfactory bulbs in his brain and then grown in the lab, these cells were then injected above and below the impaired spinal tissue.

Fidyka regained sensory and motor function in his lower limbs, notably on the side of the transplanted OEC&#x27;s. Fidyka first noticed the success three months after the procedure, when his left thigh started gaining muscle mass. MRIs suggest that the gap in his spinal cord has been closed up. He is believed to be the first person in the world to recover sensory function from a complete severing of the spinal nerves.

<text>The Catholic Church in the United States is part of the worldwide Catholic Church in communion with the pope. With 23 percent of the United States&#x27; population , the Catholic Church is the country&#x27;s second-largest religious grouping after Protestantism, and the country&#x27;s largest single church if Protestantism is divided into separate denominations. In a 2020 Gallup poll, 25% of Americans said they were Catholic. The United States has the fourth-largest Catholic population in the world, after Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines.

==History==

Catholicism has had a significant cultural, social, and political impact on the United States.

===Early colonial period===

One of the Thirteen Colonies of British America, the Province of Maryland, &quot;a Catholic Proprietary&quot;, was founded with an explicitly English Catholic identity in the 17th century, contrasting itself with neighboring the Protestant-dominated Massachusetts Bay Colony and Colony of Virginia. It was named after the Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I of England. Politically, it was under the influence of Catholic colonial families of Maryland such as the Calvert Baron Baltimore and the Carroll family, the latter of Irish origin.

Much of the religious situation in the Thirteen Colonies reflected the sectarian divisions of the English Civil War. This predicament was especially precarious for Catholics. For this reason, Calvert wanted to provide &quot;a refuge for his fellow Catholics&quot; who were &quot;harassed in England by the Protestant majority.&quot; King Charles I, as a &quot;Catholic sympathizer&quot;, favored and facilitated Calvert&#x27;s plan if only to make evident that a &quot;policy of religious toleration could permit Catholics and Protestants to live together in harmony.&quot;

The Province of Pennsylvania, which was given to Quaker William Penn by the last Catholic King of England, James II, advocated religious toleration as a principle and some Catholics lived there. There were also some Catholics in the Province of New York, named after King James II.

In 1785, the estimated number of Catholics was at 25,000; 15,800 in Maryland, 7,000 in Pennsylvania and 1,500 in New York. There were only 25 priests serving the faithful. This was less than 2% of the total population in the Thirteen Colonies.

In 1776, after the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted and issued the United States Declaration of Independence and the Continental Army prevailed over the British in the American Revolutionary War, the United States came to incorporate into itself territories with a pre-existing Catholic history under their previous governance by New France and New Spain, the two premier European Catholic powers active in North America. The territorial evolution of the United States since 1776 has meant that today more areas that are now part of the United States were Catholic in colonial times before they were Protestant.

===Founding of the United States===
Anti-Catholicism was the policy for the English who first settled the New England colonies, and it persisted in the face of warfare with the French in New France, now part of Canada. Maryland was founded by a Catholic, Lord Baltimore, as the first &#x27;non-denominational&#x27; colony and was the first to accommodate Catholics. A charter was issued to him in 1632.

In 1650, the Puritans in the colony rebelled and repealed the Act of Toleration. Catholicism was outlawed and Catholic priests were hunted and exiled. By 1658, the Act of Toleration was reinstated and Maryland became the center of Catholicism into the mid-19th century. In 1689, Puritans rebelled and again repealed the Maryland Toleration Act. These rebels cooperated with the colonial assembly &quot;dominated by Anglicans to endow the Church of England with tax support and to bar Catholics (and Quakers) from holding public office.&quot; New York proved more tolerant with its Catholic governor, Thomas Dongan, and other Catholic officials. Freedom of religion returned with the American Revolution.

In 1756, a Maryland Catholic official estimated seven thousand practicing Catholics in Maryland and three thousand in Pennsylvania. The Williamsburg Foundation estimates in 1765 Maryland Catholics at 20,000 and 6,000 in Pennsylvania. The population of these colonies at the time was approximately 180,000 and 200,000, respectively. By the time the American War for Independence started in 1776, Catholics formed 1.6%, or 40,000 persons of the 2.5 million population of the 13 colonies. Another estimate is 35,000 in 1789, 60% in Maryland with not many more than 30 priests. John Carroll, first Catholic Bishop, in 1785, two years after the Treaty of Paris (1783), reported 24,000 registered communicants in the new country, of whom 90% were in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

After the Revolution, Rome made entirely new arrangements for the creation of an American diocese under American bishops. Numerous Catholics served in the American army and the new nation had very close ties with Catholic France. General George Washington insisted on toleration; for example, he issued strict orders in 1775 that &quot;Pope&#x27;s Day&quot;, the colonial equivalent of Guy Fawkes Night, was not to be celebrated. European Catholics played major military roles, especially Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, Charles Hector, comte d&#x27;Estaing, Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kościuszko. Irish-born Commodore John Barry from Co Wexford, Ireland, often credited as &quot;the Father of the American Navy&quot;, also played an important military role. In a letter to Bishop Carroll, Washington acknowledged this unique contribution of French Catholics as well as the patriotic contribution of Carroll himself: &quot;And I promise that your fellow-citizens will not forget the patriotic part which you took in the accomplishments of their Revolution, and the establishment of their government; nor the important assistance which they received from a nation in which the Roman Catholic religion is professed.&quot;

Beginning in approximately 1780 there was a struggle between lay trustees and bishops over the ownership of church property, with the trustees losing control following the 1852 Plenary Councils of Baltimore.

Historian Jay Dolan, writing on the colonial era in 2011, said:
:They had lived as second-class citizens, discriminated against politically, professionally, and socially. The revolution changed all this. New laws and new constitutions gave them religious freedom... [leading] John Carroll to observe in 1779 that Roman Catholics are members of Congress, assemblies, and hold civil and military posts.

President Washington promoted religious tolerance by proclamations and by publicly attending services in various Protestant and Catholic churches. The old colonial laws imposing restrictions on Catholics were gradually abolished by the states, and were prohibited in the new federal constitution.

In 1787, two Catholics, Daniel Carroll of the Irish O&#x27;Carrolls and Irish born Thomas Fitzsimons, helped draft the new United States Constitution. John Carroll was appointed by the Vatican as Prefect Apostolic, making him superior of the missionary church in the thirteen states. He formulated the first plans for Georgetown University and became the first American bishop in 1789.

===19th century===
In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase saw vast territories in French Louisiana transferred over from the First French Republic, areas that would become the following states; Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Minnesota, Louisiana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana, half of Colorado, parts of New Mexico, Texas, and North Dakota. The French named a number of their settlements after Catholic saints, such as St. Louis, Sault Ste. Marie, St. Ignace, St. Charles and others. The Catholic, culturally French population of Americans, descended from this colony are today known as the Louisiana Creole and Cajun people.

During the 19th century, territories previously belonging to the Catholic Spanish Empire became part of the United States, starting with Florida in the 1820s. Most of the Spanish American territories with a Catholic heritage became independent during the early 19th century, this included Mexico on the border of the United States. The United States subsequently annexed parts of Mexico, starting with Texas in the 1840s and after the end of the Mexican–American War an area known as the Mexican Cession, including what would become the states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, the rest of New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. To an even greater extent than the French, the Spanish had named many settlements in the colonial period after Catholic saints or in reference to Catholic religious symbolism, names that they would retain after becoming part of the United States, especially in California (Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, San Juan Capistrano, San Luis Obispo and numerous others), as well as Texas (San Antonio, San Juan, San Marcos and San Angelo), New Mexico (Santa Fe) and Florida (St. Augustine). In 1898, following the Spanish–American War, the United States took control of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, and Cuba for a time, all of which had several centuries of Spanish Catholic colonial history, though they were not made into states.

The number of Catholics surged starting in the 1840s as German, Irish, and other European Catholics came in large numbers. After 1890, Italians and Poles formed the largest numbers of new Catholics, but many countries in Europe contributed, as did Quebec. By 1850, Catholics had become the country&#x27;s largest single denomination. Between 1860 and 1890, their population tripled to seven million.

====Catholic revival====
Historian John McGreevy identifies a major Catholic revival that swept across Europe, North America, and South America in the early 19th century. It was nurtured in the world of Catholic urban neighborhoods, parishes, schools, and associations, whose members understood themselves as arrayed against, and morally superior to the wider American society. The Catholic Revival is called &quot;Ultramontanism&quot;. It included a new emphasis on Thomistic theology for intellectuals. For parishioners it meant a much deeper piety that emphasized miracles, saints, and new devotions such as, compulsory Sunday attendance, regular confession and communion, praying the rosary, a devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and meatless Fridays. There was a deeper respect for bishops, and especially the Pope, with more direct control by the Vatican over selecting bishops and less autonomy for local parishes. There was a sharp increase in Mass attendance, religious vocations soared, especially among women. Catholics set up a parochial school system using the newly available nuns, and funding from the more religious parents. Intermarriage with Protestants was strongly discouraged. It was tolerated only if the children were brought up Catholics. The parochial schools effectively promoted marriage inside the faith. By the late 19th century dioceses were building foreign language elementary schools in parishes that catered to Germans and other non-English speaking groups. They raised large sums to build English-only diocesan high schools, which had the effect of increasing ethnic intermarriage and diluting ethnic nationalism. Leadership was increasingly in the hands of the Irish. The Irish bishops worked closely with the Vatican and promoted Vatican supremacy that culminated in Papal infallibility proclaimed in 1870.

The bishops began standardizing discipline in the American Church with the convocation of the Plenary Councils of Baltimore in 1852, 1866 and 1884. These councils resulted in the promulgation of the Baltimore Catechism and the establishment of the Catholic University of America.

Jesuit priests who had been expelled from Europe found a new base in the U.S. They founded numerous secondary schools and 28 colleges and universities, including Georgetown University (1789), St. Louis University (1818), Boston College, the College of Holy Cross, the University of Santa Clara, and several Loyola Colleges. Many other religious communities like the Dominicans, Congregation of Holy Cross, and Franciscans followed suit.

In the 1890s, the &quot;Americanism&quot; controversy roiled senior officials. The Vatican suspected there was too much liberalism in the American Church, and the result was a turn to conservative theology as the Irish bishops increasingly demonstrated their total loyalty to the Pope, and traces of liberal thought in the Catholic colleges were suppressed. As part of this controversy, the founder of the Paulist Fathers, Isaac Hecker, was accused by the French cleric of subjectivism and crypto-Protestantism. Additionally some who sympathized with Hecker in France were accused of Americanism.

=====Nuns and sisters=====
Nuns and sisters played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century. In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. But there were very few rich American Catholics, and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 congregations in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different congregations by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers. Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.

On April 8, 2008, Cardinal William Levada, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Pope Benedict XVI, met with the Leadership Conference of Women Religious leaders in Rome and communicated that the CDF would conduct a doctrinal assessment of the LCWR, expressing concern that the nuns were expressing radical feminist views. According to Laurie Goodstein, the investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a &quot;vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church&#x27;s schools, hospitals and charities&quot;, was ultimately closed in 2015 by Pope Francis.

====Anti-Catholicism====
Some anti-Catholic political movements appeared: the Know Nothings in the 1840s. American Protective Association in the 1890s, and the second Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, were active in the United States. But even as early as 1884, in the face of outbreaks of anti-Catholicism, Catholic leaders like James Cardinal Gibbons were filled with admiration for their country: &quot;The oftener I go to Europe,&quot; Gibbons said, &quot;the longer I remain there, and the more I study the political condition of its people, I return home filled with greater admiration for our own country and [am] more profoundly grateful that I am an American citizen.&quot; Animosity by Protestants waned as Catholics demonstrated their patriotism in World War I, their commitment to charity, and their dedication to democratic values.

===20th–21st centuries===
In the era of intense emigration from the 1840s to 1914, bishops often set up separate parishes for major ethnic groups, from Ireland, Germany, Poland, French Canada and Italy. In Iowa, the development of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, the work of Bishop Loras and the building of St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral, to meet the needs of Germans and Irish, is illustrative. Noteworthy, too, was the contribution of 400 Italian Jesuit expatriates who, between 1848 and 1919, planted dozens of institutions to serve the diverse population out West. By century&#x27;s end, they had founded colleges (later to become universities) in San Francisco, Santa Clara, Denver, Seattle and Spokane to meet the cultural and religious needs of people of that region. They also ministered to miners in Colorado, to Native Peoples in several states, and to Hispanics in New Mexico, &quot;building churches [in the latter state], publishing books and newspapers, and running schools in both the public and private sectors.&quot;

By the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the Philippines, Poland and Latin America, especially Mexico and Central America. This multiculturalism and diversity has influenced the conduct of Catholicism in the United States. For example, most dioceses offer Mass in a number of languages, and an increasing number of parishes offer Masses in the official language of the church, Latin, due to its universal nature.

Sociologist Andrew Greeley, an ordained Catholic priest at the University of Chicago, undertook a series of national surveys of Catholics in the late 20th century. He published hundreds of books and articles, both technical and popular. His biographer summarizes his interpretation:
:He argued for the continued salience of ethnicity in American life and the distinctiveness of the Catholic religious imagination. Catholics differed from other Americans, he explained in a variety of publications, by their tendency to think in &quot;sacramental&quot; terms, imagining God as present in a world that was revelatory rather than bleak. The poetic elements in the Catholic tradition—its stories, imagery, and rituals—kept most Catholics in the fold, according to Greeley, whatever their disagreements with particular aspects of church discipline or doctrine. Despite the unchanging nature of church doctrine, Greeley insisted that Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical upholding the Catholic ban on contraception is solely responsible for the sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975.

In 1965, 71% of Catholics attended Mass regularly.

In the later 20th century &quot;[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of clerical child abuse of children and adolescents, of episcopal negligence in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.&quot; Because of this, higher scrutiny and governance as well as protective policies and diocesan investigation into seminaries have been enacted to correct these former abuses of power, and safeguard parishioners and the church from further abuses and scandals.

One initiative is the &quot;National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management&quot; (NLRCM), a lay-led group born in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal and dedicated to bringing better administrative practices to 194 dioceses that include 19,000 parishes nationwide with some 35,000 lay ecclesial ministers who log 20 hours or more a week in these parishes.

According to a 2015 study by Pew Researchers, 39% of Catholics attend church at least once a week and 40%, once or twice a month.

Although the issue of trusteeism was mostly settled in the 19th century, there have been some related issues. In 2005, an interdict was issued to board members of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri) in an attempt to get them to turn over the church property to the Archdiocese of St. Louis. In 2006, a priest was accused of stealing $1.4 million from his parish, prompting a debate over Connecticut Raised Bill 1098 as a means of forcing the Catholic church to manage money differently. Related to issues of asset ownership, some parishes have been liquidated and the assets taken by the diocese instead of being distributed to nearby parishes, which in violation of church financial rules.

In 2009, John Micklethwait, editor of &quot;The Economist&quot; and co-author of &quot;God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World&quot;, said that American Catholicism, which he describes in his book as &quot;arguably the most striking Evangelical success story of the second half of the nineteenth century,&quot; has competed quite happily &quot;without losing any of its basic characteristics.&quot; It has thrived in America&#x27;s &quot;pluralism&quot;.

In 2011, an estimated 26 million American Catholics were &quot;fallen-away&quot;, that is, not practicing their faith. Some religious commentators commonly refer to them as &quot;the second largest religious denomination in the United States.&quot; Recent Pew Research survey results in 2014 show about 31.7% of American adults were raised Catholic, while 41% from among that group no longer identify as Catholic.

In a 2015 survey by researchers at Georgetown University, Americans who self identify as Catholic, including those who do not attend Mass regularly, numbered 81.6 million or 25% of the population, and 68.1 million or 20% of the American population are Catholics tied to a specific parish. About 25% of US Catholics say they attend Masses once a week or more, and about 38% went at least once a month. The study found that the number of US Catholics has increased by 3 to 6% each decade since 1965, and that the Catholic Church is &quot;the most diverse in terms of race and ethnicity in the US,&quot; with Hispanics accounting for 38% of Catholics and blacks and Asians 3% each. The Catholic Church in the US &quot;represents perhaps the most multi-ethnic organization of any kind, and so is a major laboratory for cross-cultural cooperation and cross-cultural communication completely within the nation&#x27;s borders.&quot; It is as if it wishes to forge a broader ecclesial identity to give newcomers a more inclusive welcome, similar to the aspirations of 19th century church leaders like Archbishops John Ireland and James Gibbons who &quot;wanted Catholic immigrants to become fully American, rather than &#x27;strangers in a strange land.&#x27; &quot; Only 2 percent of American Catholics go to confession on a regular basis, while three-quarters of them go to confession once a year or less often; a valid confession is required by the Church after committing mortal sin to return to the State of Grace, necessary to receive Holy Communion. As one of the precepts of the church, it is also required that every Catholic makes a valid confession at least once a year.

According to Matthew Bunsen&#x27;s analysis of a Real Clear poll of American Catholics in late 2019:
:Catholicism has been battered by the winds of secularism, materialism, and relativism. Failures in catechesis and formation have created wide gaps in practice and belief that stretch now into every aspect of Catholic life.

Since 1970, weekly church attendance among Catholics has dropped from 55% to 20%, the number of priests declined from 59,000 to 35,000 and the number of people who have left Catholicism has increased from under 2 million in 1975 to over 30 million today. In 2022, there were fewer than 42,000 nuns left in the United States, a 76% decline over 50 years, with fewer than 1% of nuns under age 40.

The RealClear poll data indicates that the Latino element has now reached 37 percent of the Catholic population, and growing. It is 60 percent Democratic, while the non-Latinos are split about 50-50 politically. Although many Americans still identify as Catholics, their religious participation rates are declining. Today only 39% of all Catholics go to Mass at least weekly. Nearly two-thirds of Catholics say that their trust in the church leadership has been undermined by the clergy sex abuse crisis. Nevertheless, 86% of all Catholics still consider religion important in their own lives.

==Organization==


Catholics gather as local communities called parishes, headed by a priest, and typically meet at a permanent church building for liturgies every Sunday, weekdays and on holy days. Within the 196 geographical dioceses and archdioceses (excluding the Archdiocese for the Military Services), there were 17,007 local Catholic parishes in the United States in 2018. The Catholic Church has the third highest total number of local congregations in the US behind Southern Baptists and United Methodists. However, the average Catholic parish is significantly larger than the average Baptist or Methodist congregation; there are more than four times as many Catholics as Southern Baptists and more than eight times as many Catholics as United Methodists.

In the United States, there are 197 ecclesiastical jurisdictions:
* 177 Latin Church dioceses
** including 32 Latin Catholic archdioceses
* 18 Eastern Catholic eparchies
** including 2 Eastern Catholic archeparchies
** including 1 Eparchy (for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church)
* 2 ordinariates
** one personal ordinariate for former Anglicans who came into full Catholic communion
** one for members of the military (though equivalent to an archdiocese, it is technically a military ordinariate)

Eastern Catholic Churches are churches with origins in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa that have their own distinctive liturgical, legal and organizational systems and are identified by the national or ethnic character of their region of origin. Each is considered fully equal to the Latin tradition within the Catholic Church. In the United States, there are 15 Eastern Church dioceses (called eparchies) and two Eastern Church archdioceses (or archeparchies), the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh and the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia.

The apostolic exarchate for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in the United States is headed by a bishop who is a member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. An apostolic exarchate is the Eastern Catholic Church equivalent of an apostolic vicariate. It is not a full-fledged diocese/eparchy, but is established by the Holy See for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in an area outside the territory of the Eastern Catholic Church to which they belong. It is headed by a bishop or a priest with the title of exarch.

The Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter was established January 1, 2012, to serve former Anglican groups and clergy in the United States who sought to become Catholic. Similar to a diocese though national in scope, the ordinariate is based in Houston, Texas, and includes parishes and communities across the United States that are fully Catholic, while retaining elements of their Anglican heritage and traditions.

, 8 dioceses out of 196 are vacant (&quot;sede vacante&quot;).

The central leadership body of the Catholic Church in the United States is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, made up of the hierarchy of bishops (including archbishops) of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, although each bishop is independent in his own diocese, answerable only to the Holy See. The USCCB elects a president to serve as their administrative head, but he is in no way the &quot;head&quot; of the church or of Catholics in the United States. In addition to the 195 dioceses and one exarchate represented in the USCCB, there are several dioceses in the nation&#x27;s other four overseas dependencies. In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the bishops in the six dioceses (one metropolitan archdiocese and five suffragan dioceses) form their own episcopal conference, the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference (&quot;Conferencia Episcopal Puertorriqueña&quot;). The bishops in US insular areas in the Pacific Ocean—the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of American Samoa, and the Territory of Guam—are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific.

No primate exists for Catholics in the United States. In the 1850s, the Archdiocese of Baltimore was acknowledged a &quot;Prerogative of Place&quot;, which confers to its archbishop some of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries. The Archdiocese of Baltimore was the first diocese established in the United States, in 1789, with John Carroll (1735–1815) as its first bishop. It was, for many years, the most influential diocese in the fledgling nation. Now, however, the United States has several large archdioceses and a number of cardinal-archbishops.

By far, most Catholics in the United States belong to the Latin Church of the Catholic Church. Rite generally refers to the form of worship (&quot;liturgical rite&quot;) in a church community owing to cultural and historical differences as well as differences in practice. However, the Vatican II document, &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; (&quot;Of the Eastern Churches&quot;), acknowledges that these Eastern Catholic communities are &quot;true Churches&quot; and not just rites within the Catholic Church. There are 14 other churches in the United States (23 within the global Catholic Church) which are in communion with Rome, fully recognized and valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church. They have their own bishops and eparchies. The largest of these communities in the U.S. is the Chaldean Catholic Church. Most of these churches are of Eastern European and Middle Eastern origin. Eastern Catholic Churches are distinguished from Eastern Orthodox, identifiable by their usage of the term Catholic.

In recent years, particularly following the issuing of the apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007, the United States has emerged as a stronghold for the small but growing Traditionalist Catholic movement, along with France, England and a few other Anglophone countries. There are over 600 locations throughout the country where the Traditional Latin Mass is offered.

==Personnel==

The church employs people in a variety of leadership and service roles. Its ministers include ordained clergy (bishops, priests, and deacons) and non-ordained lay ecclesial ministers, theologians, and catechists.

Some Catholics, both lay and clergy, live in a form of consecrated life, rather than in marriage. This includes a wide range of relationships, from monastic (monks and nuns), to mendicant (friars and sisters), apostolic (priests, brothers, and sisters), and secular and lay institutes. While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the church. Consecrated life – in and of itself – does not make a person a part of the clergy or a minister of the church.

Additionally, many lay people are employed in &quot;secular&quot; careers in support of church institutions, including educators, health care professionals, finance and human resources experts, lawyers, and others.

===Bishops===
Leadership of the Catholic Church in the United States is provided by the bishops, individually for their own dioceses and collectively through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. There are some mid-level groupings of bishops, such as ecclesiastical provinces (often covering a state) and the fourteen geographic regions of the USCCB, but these have little significance for most purposes.

The ordinary office for a bishop is to be the bishop of a particular diocese, its chief pastor and minister, usually geographically defined and incorporating, on average, about 350,000 Catholic Christians. In canon law, the bishop leading a particular diocese, or similar office, is called an &quot;ordinary&quot; (i.e., he has complete jurisdiction in this territory or grouping of Christians).

There are two non-geographic dioceses, called &quot;ordinariates&quot;, one for military personnel and one for former Anglicans who are in full communion with the Catholic Church.

Dioceses are grouped together geographically into provinces, usually within a state, part of a state, or multiple states together (see map below). A province comprises several dioceses which look to one ordinary bishop (usually of the most populous or historically influential diocese/city) for guidance and leadership. This lead bishop is their archbishop and his diocese is the archdiocese. The archbishop is called the &quot;metropolitan&quot; bishop who strives to achieve some unanimity of practice with his brother &quot;suffragan&quot; bishops.

Some larger dioceses have additional bishops assisting the diocesan bishop, and these are called &quot;auxiliary&quot; bishops or, if a &quot;coadjutor&quot; bishop, with right of succession.

Additionally, some bishops are called to advise and assist the bishop of Rome, the pope, in a particular way, either as an additional responsibility on top of their diocesan office or sometimes as a full-time position in the Roman Curia or related institution serving the universal church. These are called cardinals, because they are &quot;incardinated&quot; onto a second diocese (Rome). All cardinals under the age of 80 participate in the election of a new pope when the office of the papacy becomes vacant.

There are 428 active and retired Catholic bishops in the United States:

255 active bishops:
* 36 archbishops

===Clergy and ministers===
In 2018, there were approximately 100,000 clergy and ministers employed by the church in the United States, including:
* 36,580 presbyters (priests)
** 25,254 diocesan
** 11,326 religious/consecrated
* 18,291 ordinary (permanent) deacons
* 39,651 lay ecclesial ministers (2016)
** 23,149 diocesan
** 16,502 religious/consecrated

There are also approximately 30,000 seminarians/students in formation for ministry:
* 3,526 candidates for priesthood
* 2,088 candidates for diaconate
* 16,585 candidates for lay ecclesial ministry

===Lay employees===
The 630 Catholic hospitals in the U.S. have a combined budget of $101.7 billion, and employ 641,030 full-time equivalent staff.

The 6,525 Catholic primary and secondary schools in the U.S. employ 151,101 full-time equivalent staff, 97.2% of whom are lay and 2.3% are consecrated, and 0.5% are ordained.

The 261 Catholic institutions of higher (tertiary) education in the U.S. employ approximately 250,000 full-time equivalent staff, including faculty, administrators, and support staff.

Overall, the Catholic Church employs more than one million employees with an operating budget of nearly $100 billion to run parishes, diocesan primary and secondary schools, nursing homes, retreat centers, hospitals, and other charitable institutions.

==Institutions==

===Parochial schools===
By the middle of the 19th century, the Catholics in larger cities started building their own parochial school system. The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by strong opposition to any public funding of parochial schools. The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low-paid sisters as teachers.

In the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University of America in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants. However, by the later half the 20th century Catholic schools began to perform significantly better than their public counterparts. In 2024, the National Catholic Educational Association reported that 99% of the students in 1,174 Catholic secondary schools graduated on time and 85% of them went on to four-year colleges. 

===Universities and colleges===

According to the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities in 2011, there are approximately 230 Catholic universities and colleges in the United States with nearly 1 million students and some 65,000 professors. In 2016, the number of tertiary schools fell to 227, while the number of students also fell to 798,006. The national university of the church, founded by the nation&#x27;s bishops in 1887, is The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. The first Catholic college/university of higher learning established in the United States is Georgetown University, founded in 1789. The richest U.S. Catholic university is the University of Notre Dame (founded in 1842) with an endowment of over 20 billion in 2022. In the 2025 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, 9 of the top 100 national universities and 6 of the top national liberal arts colleges in the US were Catholic.

===Seminaries===
According to the &quot;2016 Official Catholic Directory&quot;, there were 243 seminaries with 4,785 students in the United States; 3,629 diocesan seminarians and 1,456 religious seminarians. By the official 2017 statistics, there are 5,050 seminarians (3,694 diocesan and 1,356 religious) in the United States. In addition, the American Catholic bishops oversee the Pontifical North American College for American seminarians and priests studying at one of the Pontifical Universities in Rome.

===Healthcare system===
In 2002, Catholic health care system, overseeing 625 hospitals with a combined revenue of 30 billion dollars, was the nation&#x27;s largest group of nonprofit systems. In 2008, the cost of running these hospitals had risen to $84.6 billion, including the $5.7 billion they donate. According to the Catholic Health Association of the United States, 60 health care systems, on average, admit one in six patients nationwide each year. According to Merger Watch (2018), Catholic facilities make up about 10% of all &quot;sole community providers&quot; in the US (49 out of 514). In some states, the percentage is much greater: in Wisconsin and South Dakota, for example, &quot;Catholic hospitals account for at least 50% of sole community providers.&quot;

===Catholic Charities===

Catholic Charities is active as the largest voluntary social service networks in the United States. In 2009, it welcomed in New Jersey the 50,000th refugee to come to the United States from Burma. Likewise, the US Bishops&#x27; Migration and Refugee Services has resettled 14,846 refugees from Burma since 2006. In 2010 Catholic Charities USA was one of only four charities among the top 400 charitable organizations to witness an increase in donations in 2009, according to a survey conducted by &quot;The Chronicle of Philanthropy.&quot;

==Demographics==

The number of Catholics grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries through high fertility and immigration, especially from Ireland and Germany, and after 1880, Eastern Europe, Italy, and Quebec. Large scale Catholic immigration from Mexico began after 1910, and in 2019 Latinos comprised 37 percent of American Catholics.

Since 1960, the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has fallen from about 25% to 22%. In a 2021 Pew Research study, &quot;21% of US adults described themselves as Catholic, identical to the Catholic share of the population in 2014.&quot; In absolute numbers, Catholics have increased from 45 million to 72 million. , 39% of American Catholics attend church weekly, compared to 45% of American Protestants.

About 10% of the United States&#x27; population are former Catholics or non-practicing, almost 30 million people. People have left for a number of reasons, factors which have also affected other denominations: loss of belief, disenchantment, indifference, or disaffiliation for another religious group or for none. Though Catholic adherents are present throughout the country, Catholics are generally more concentrated in the Northeast and urban Midwest. Currently, however, they are also clustered in the southwest. This is because of the continuing growth of the American Hispanic community as a share of the U.S. population is gradually shifting the geographic center of U.S. Catholicism from the Northeast and urban Midwest to the South and the West. Regional distribution of U.S. Catholics (as a percentage of the total U.S. Catholic population) is as follows: Northeast, 24%; Midwest, 19%; South, 32% (a percentage that has increased in recent years due to a growing number of Catholics mainly in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, with the rest of the Southern states remaining overwhelmingly Protestant); and West, 25%. While the wealthiest and most educated Americans tend to belong to some Protestant American groupings as well as to Jewish and Hindu constituencies as a whole, more Catholics (13.3 million ), owing to their sheer numbers, reside in households with a yearly income of $100,000-or-more than any other individual religious group, and more Catholics hold college degrees (over 19 million) than do members of any other faith community in the United States when divided according to their respective denominations or religious designations.

There were 70,412,000 registered Catholics in the United States (22% of the US population) in 2017, according to the American bishops&#x27; count in their &quot;Official Catholic Directory 2016&quot;. This count primarily rests on the parish assessment tax which priests evaluate yearly according to the number of registered members and contributors. In July 2021, the Public Religion Research Institute issued its own report based on a new census of 500,000 people. It also noted that 22% of 330 million Americans identified as Catholic: 12%, white; 8%, Latino; and 2%, other (Black, Asian, etc.). Estimates of the overall American Catholic population from recent years generally range around 20% to 28%. According to Albert J. Menedez, research director of &quot;Americans for Religious Liberty&quot;, many Americans continue to call themselves Catholic but &quot;do not register at local parishes for a variety of reasons.&quot; According to a survey of 35,556 American residents (released in 2008 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life), 23.9% of Americans identify themselves as Catholic (approximately 72 million of a national population of 306 million residents). The study notes that 10% of those people who identify themselves as Protestant in the interview are former Catholics and 8% of those who identity themselves as Catholic are former Protestants. In recent years, more parishes have opened than closed.

The northeastern quadrant of the US (i.e., New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, and West North Central) has seen a decline in the number of parishes since 1970, but parish numbers are up in the other five regions (i.e., South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Pacific, and Mountain regions) and are growing steadily. Catholics in the US are about 6% of the church&#x27;s total worldwide 1.3 billion membership.
A poll by The Barna Group in 2004 found Catholic ethnicity to be 60% non-Hispanic white (includes Americans with historically Catholic ethnicities such as Irish, Italian, German, Polish, or French), 31% Hispanic of any nationality (mostly Mexicans but also many Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Salvadorans, Colombians, Guatemalans and Hondurans among others), 4% Black (including Africans, Haitians, black Latino and Caribbean), and 5% other ethnicity (mostly Filipinos, Vietnamese and other Asian Americans, Americans who are multiracial and have mixed ethnicities, and American Indians). Among the non-Hispanic whites, about 16 million Catholics identify as being of Irish descent, about 13 million as German, about 12 million as Italian, about 7 million as Polish, and about 5 million as French (note that many identify with more than one ethnicity). The roughly 7.8 million Catholics who are converts (mainly from Protestantism, with a smaller number from irreligion or other religions) are also mostly non-Hispanic white, including many people of British, Dutch, and Scandinavian ancestry.

Between 1990 and 2008, there were 11 million additional Catholics. The growth in the Latino population accounted for 9 million of these. They accounted for 32% of all American Catholics in 2008 as opposed to 20% in 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who identified as Catholic dropped from 67% in 2010 to 55% in 2013.

According to a more recent Pew Forum report which examined American religiosity in 2014 and compared it to 2007, there were 50.9 million adult Catholics (excluding children under 18), forming about 20.8% of the U.S. population, down from 54.3 million and 23.9% in 2007. Pew also found that the Catholic population is aging, forming a higher percentage of the elderly population than the young, and retention rates are also worse among the young. About 41% of those &quot;young&quot; raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith. Conversions to Catholicism are rare, with 89% of current Catholics being raised in the religion; 8% of current Catholics are ex-Protestants, 2% were raised unaffiliated, and 1% in other religions (Orthodox Christian, Mormon or other nontrinitarian, Buddhist, Muslim, etc.), with Jews and Hindus least likely to become Catholic of all the religious groups surveyed. Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. According to the 2015 Pew Research Center, &quot;the Catholic share of the population has been relatively stable over the long term, according to a variety of other surveys. By race, 59% of Catholics are non-Hispanic white, 34% Hispanic, 3% black, 3% Asian, and 2% mixed or Native American. Conversely, 19% of non-Hispanic whites were Catholic in 2014 (down from 22% in 2007), whereas 55% of Hispanics were (versus 58% in 2007). In 2015, Hispanics were 38%, while blacks and Asians were at 3% each. Because conversion away from Catholicism as well as dropping out of religion completely is presently occurring much more quickly among Hispanics than among Euro-American whites, Black (2.9% of US Catholic population) and Asian-American Catholics, it is doubtful they will outnumber the latter three categories of Catholics in the foreseeable future. Pew Research Center predicts that by 2050 (when the Hispanic population will be 128 million), only 40% of &quot;third generation Latinos&quot; will be Catholic, with 22% becoming Protestant, 24% becoming unaffiliated, and the remainder, other. This corresponds to a sharp decline in the Catholic percentage among self-identified Democrats, who are more likely to be nonwhite than Republicans. In one study, three authors found that around 10% of US Catholics are &quot;Secularists&quot;, &quot;meaning that their religious identification is purely nominal.&quot;

===By state (2017)===

==Cultural, social, and political views==
===Politics===
Catholicism has had a significant political impact on the United States, and the religion has historically been associated with left-wing politics and the Democratic Party. Since the 1970s, Catholics are often being regarded as swing voters.

The 1840s saw Catholics began to identify with the Democrats against the conservative and evangelical-influenced Whigs. In the 1890s, Catholics favored the Democratic Party over the Republicans. This continued into the 20th century, where Catholics formed a core part of the New Deal Coalition.

Al Smith governor of New York was the first Catholic nominated for president by a major party as the Democratic nominee in the 1928 election.

Two Catholics have been President of the United States: Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) and Joe Biden (2021–2025), In 2016, Pope Francis said of Donald Trump: &quot;A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.&quot; According to the Pew Research Center, Catholics are the most likely of any major Christian group in the United States to support the morality of casual sex. Surveys have repeatedly indicated that laity are more culturally liberal than the median voter, including on abortion rights and same-sex marriage. However, the Catholic Church officially opposes both. Church leadership tends to lean more orthodox. There are also some fundamentalist-like activist conservative groups.

== Criticism by Pope Francis ==
In 2023, Pope Francis criticized the Catholic Church in the United States as reactionary, saying that ideology had replaced faith in some parts of it. In November 2023, the Pope removed a conservative Texas bishop, Joseph E. Strickland of Tyler, Texas.

<text>The Secret Garden is a children&#x27;s novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett first published in book form in 1911, after serialisation in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; (November 1910 – August 1911). Set in England, it is seen as a classic of English children&#x27;s literature. The American edition was published by the Frederick A. Stokes Company with illustrations by M. L. Kirk, and the British edition by Heinemann with illustrations by Charles Heath Robinson.

Several stage and film adaptations have been made of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;.

==Plot summary==
At the turn of the 20th century, Mary Lennox is a neglected and unloved 10-year-old girl, born in British India to wealthy British parents. She is cared for primarily by native servants, who spoil her and allow her to have free rein. After a cholera epidemic kills her parents, Mary is left alone when the few surviving servants flee.

Mary is discovered by British soldiers who place her in the care of an English clergyman, whose children taunt her by calling her &quot;Mistress Mary, quite contrary&quot;. She is sent to England to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, husband of her father&#x27;s sister Lilias. He lives on the Yorkshire Moors in a large country house, Misselthwaite Manor. On arrival, Mary discovers that Lilias is dead and that Archibald is a hunchback.

At first, Mary remains angry and defiant. She dislikes her new home, the people living in it and, most of all, the bleak moor on which it sits. Over time, she becomes less cantankerous. She befriends her maid, Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about Lilias, who would spend hours in a private walled garden growing roses. Lilias died after an accident in the garden ten years previously, and the devastated Archibald locked the garden and buried the key.

Mary becomes interested in finding the secret garden herself, and her manners begin to soften as a result. Soon, she comes to enjoy the company of Martha, the gardener Ben Weatherstaff, and a friendly robin redbreast. Her health and attitude improve.

The robin draws Mary&#x27;s attention to an area of disturbed soil. Here she finds the key to the locked garden. After her first day exploring, she asks Martha for garden tools, which Martha sends with Dickon, her 12-year-old brother, who spends most of his time out on the moors. Mary and Dickon take a liking to each other. Eager to absorb his gardening knowledge, Mary tells him about the secret garden.

One night, Mary follows mysterious cries that echo through the house. She is startled to find a boy of her own age, Colin, living in a hidden bedroom. She discovers that they are cousins, Colin being the son of Archibald Craven. Colin suffers from fevers and is confined to bed, believed unable to walk. Like Mary, he has grown very spoiled, with servants obeying his every whim in order to prevent his hysterical temper tantrums. Mary visits Colin every day that week, distracting him from his troubles and despondency with stories of the moor, Dickon, and the secret garden. She eventually confides to Colin that she has access to the secret garden, and he asks to see it. Colin is put into his wheelchair and brought outside, the first time he has been outdoors for several years. 

In the garden, the children are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled to see the children, he admits that he believed Colin to be &quot;a cripple,&quot; with a crooked back and crooked legs. Furious at Ben&#x27;s comments, Colin rises shakily from his chair and finds that he can stand, although his legs are weak from long disuse. Mary and Dickon spend almost every day in the garden with Colin, and encourage him to attempt walking. Gradually, Colin finds renewed hope for his future. Together, the children and Ben conspire to keep Colin&#x27;s recovering health a secret from the other staff, hoping to surprise his father who is travelling abroad.

As his son&#x27;s health has improved, Archibald has been experiencing an improvement in his own spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Dickon and Martha&#x27;s mother, advising him to return to Misselthwaite, he takes the opportunity to come home. Walking around the garden wall, he is startled to hear voices inside. He finds the door unlocked, and is astonished to see the garden in full bloom and his son restored to health, having just won a race against Mary. The children tell their story, explaining the restoration of both the garden and Colin. Archibald and his son walk back to the manor together, to the amazement of the servants.

==Themes==
In his analysis of the narrative structures of &quot;the traditional novel for girls&quot;, Perry Nodelman highlights Mary Lennox as a departure from the narrative pattern of the &quot;spontaneous and ebullient&quot; orphan girl who changes her new home and family for the better, since those qualities appear later on in the narrative. The revival of the family and the home in these novels, according to Nodelman, &quot;is carried to the extreme in &quot;The Secret Garden,&quot;&quot; in which the garden&#x27;s restoration and the arrival of spring parallel the emergence of human characters from the home, &quot;almost as if they had been hibernating&quot;. Joe Sutliff Sanders examines Mary and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; within the context of the Victorian and Edwardian cultural debate over affective discipline, which was echoed in contemporary books about orphan girls. He suggests that &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; was interested in showing the benefits of affective discipline for men and boys, namely Colin who learns from Mary, understood as &quot;the novel&#x27;s representative of girlhood&quot; and how to wield his &quot;masculine privilege&quot;.

The titular garden has been the subject of much scholarly discussion. Phyllis Bixler Koppes writes that &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; makes use of the fairy tale, the exemplum, and the pastoral literary genres, which lends the novel a deeper &quot;thematic development and symbolic resonance&quot; than Burnett&#x27;s earlier children&#x27;s novels which only used elements from the first two traditions. She describes the garden as &quot;the central georgic trope, the unifying symbol of rebirth in Burnett&#x27;s novel&quot;. Madelon S. Gohlke understands the titular garden as &quot;both the scene of a tragedy, resulting in the near destruction of a family&quot;, as well as the site of its regeneration and restoration.

Alexandra Valint suggests that most of the novel&#x27;s depictions of disability coincide with the stereotypical view of people with disabilities as unhappy, helpless, and less independent than people without disabilities. Colin&#x27;s use of a wheelchair would have been understood by Edwardian readers as a marker of both disability and social status.

Elizabeth Lennox Keyser writes that &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; is ambivalent about sex roles: while Mary restores the garden and saves the family, her role in the story is overshadowed at the conclusion of the novel by the return of Colin and his father, which may be seen as a defense of patriarchal authority. Danielle E. Price notes that the novel deals with &quot;the thorny issues of sex, class, and imperialism&quot;. She writes how Mary&#x27;s development in the novel parallels &quot;the steps of nineteenth-century garden theorists in their plans for the perfect garden&quot;, with Mary ultimately turning into &quot;a girl who, like the ideal garden, can provide both beauty and comfort, and who can cultivate her male cousin, the young patriarch-in-training&quot;.

In his examination of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; within the context of postcolonialism, Jerry Phillips writes that the novel &quot;is not so much a discourse on the end of empire as an embryonic commentary on the possibility of blowback&quot;.

==Background==

At the time Burnett began working on &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, she had already established a literary reputation as a writer of children&#x27;s fiction and social realist adult fiction. She had started writing children&#x27;s fiction in the 1880s, with her most notable book at the time being her sentimental novel &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1886). &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; was a &quot;literary sensation&quot; in both the United States and Europe, and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Prior to &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, she had also written another notable work of children&#x27;s fiction, &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1905), which had begun as a story published in the American children&#x27;s magazine &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; in 1887 and was later adapted as a play in 1902.

Little is known about the literary development and conception of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. Biographers and other scholars have been able to glean the details of Burnett&#x27;s process and thoughts on her other books through her letters to family members; during the time she was working on &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, however, she was living near to them and thus did not need to send them letters. Burnett started the novel in spring 1909, as she was making plans for the garden at her home in Plandome on Long Island. In an October 1910 letter to William Heinemann, her publisher in England, she described the story, whose working title was &quot;Mistress Mary&quot;, as &quot;an innocent thriller of a story&quot; that she considered &quot;one of [her] best finds&quot;. Biographer Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina offers several explanations as to why there is so little surviving information on the book&#x27;s development. Firstly, Burnett&#x27;s health faltered after moving to her home in Plandome, and her social excursions became limited as a result. Secondly, her existing notes about &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, along with a portrait of her and some photographs, were donated by her son Vivian after her death to a lower Manhattan public school serving the deaf in remembrance of her visit there years previously, but all the items soon vanished from the archive of the school. Lastly, a few weeks before the novel&#x27;s publication, her brother-in-law died in a collision with a trolley, an event that likely darkened the novel&#x27;s publication.

Burnett&#x27;s story &quot;My Robin&quot;, however, offers a glimpse of the creation of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. In it, she addresses a reader&#x27;s question on the literary origins of the robin that appears in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, whom the reader felt &quot;could not have been a mere creature of fantasy&quot;. Burnett reminisces on her friendship with the real-life English robin, whom she described as &quot;a &quot;person&quot;—not a mere bird&quot; and who often kept her company in the rose garden where she would often write, when she lived at Maytham Hall. Recounting the first time she tried to communicate with the bird via &quot;low, soft, little sounds&quot;, she writes that she &quot;knew—years later—that this is what Mistress Mary thought when she bent down in the Long Walk and &#x27;tried to make robin sounds&#x27;&quot;.

Maytham Hall in Kent, England, where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage, is often cited as the inspiration for the book&#x27;s setting. Biographer Ann Thwaite writes that while the rose garden at Mayham Hall may have been &quot;crucial&quot; to the novel&#x27;s development, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. Thwaite suggests that, for the setting of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, Burnett may have been inspired by the moors of Emily Brontë&#x27;s 1847 novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, given that Burnett only went once to Yorkshire, to Fryston Hall. She writes that Burnett may have also taken inspiration from Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s 1847 novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, noting parallels between the two narratives: both of them, for example, feature orphans sent to &quot;mysterious mansions&quot;, whose master is largely absent. Burnett herself was aware of the similarities, remarking in a letter that Ella Hepworth Dixon had described it as a children&#x27;s version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

Scholar Gretchen V. Rector has examined the author&#x27;s manuscript of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, which she describes as &quot;the only record of the novel&#x27;s development&quot;. Eighty of the first hundred pages of the manuscript are written in black ink, while the rest and subsequent revisions were made in pencil; the spelling and punctuation tend to follow the American standard. Chapter headings were included prior to the novel&#x27;s serialization and are not present in the manuscript, with chapters in it delineated by numbers only. The pagination of the manuscript was likely done by a second person: it goes from 1 to 234, only to restart at the nineteenth chapter. From the title page, Rector surmises that the novel&#x27;s first title was &quot;Mary, Mary quite Contrary&quot;, later changed to its working title of &quot;Mistress Mary&quot;. Mary herself is originally nine in the manuscript, only to be aged up a year in a revision, perhaps to highlight the &quot;convergent paths&quot; of Mary, Colin, and the garden itself; however, this revision was not reflected in either the British or the American first editions of the novel, or in later editions. Susan Sowerby is initially introduced to the readers as a deceased character, with her daughter Martha perhaps intended to fill her role in the story; Burnett, however, changed her mind about Susan Sowerby, writing her as a living character a few pages later and crossing out the announcement of her death. Additionally, Dickon in the manuscript was physically disabled and used crutches to move around, perhaps drawing on Burnett&#x27;s recollections of her first husband, Dr. Swan Burnett, and his physical disability. Burnett later removed references to Dickon&#x27;s disability.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Secret Garden&quot; may be one of the first instances of a story for children first appearing in a magazine with an adult readership, an occasion of which Burnett herself was aware at the time. &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; was first published in ten issues (November 1910 – August 1911) of &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, with illustrations by J. Scott Williams. It was first published in book form in August 1911 by the Frederick A. Stokes Company in New York; it was also published that year by William Heinemann in London, illustrated by Charles Robinson. Its copyright expired in the US in 1986, and in most other parts of the world in 1995, placing the book in the public domain. As a result, several abridged and unabridged editions were published in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as a full-colour illustrated edition from David R. Godine, Publisher in 1989.

Inga Moore&#x27;s abridged edition of 2008, illustrated by her, is arranged so that a line of the text also serves as a caption to a picture.

==Public reception==
Upon its publication in novel format, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; garnered largely warm reviews from literary critics, and sold well, with a second printing announced within a month after the novel&#x27;s release. In general, it was seen as an enjoyable novel, and was reviewed within the context of Burnett&#x27;s previous works, including &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. It sold well during the 1911 Christmas season, becoming a bestseller in the fiction category, and placing on critical &quot;best of&quot; lists, including that of the &quot;Literary Digest&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Its literary debut in a magazine for adults led the public to understand it as adult fiction; the book was marketed accordingly, &quot;with some overlap in the juvenile market&quot;, which affected its reception by the public. Of this time, scholar Anne Lundin writes that &quot;&quot;The Secret Garden&quot; struggled to assert its own identity as a different kind of story that spoke to both the romanticism and modernism of a new century&quot;. Burnett regarded &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; as her favorite novel, although she considered one of her novels for adults, &quot;In Connection with the DeWilloughby Claim&quot;, to be her Great American Novel.

Tracing the book&#x27;s revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett&#x27;s death in 1924, Lundin notes that the author&#x27;s obituary notices all remarked on &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; and passed over &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; in silence. Burnett&#x27;s literary reputation waned over the following decades, possibly as a result of biases towards books that garner a female audience. Despite being largely overlooked by literary critics and librarians, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; enjoyed a considerable following among its readers. It continued to rank well on readers&#x27; polls for favorite stories. In 1927, it placed in the top fifteen favorite books of female &quot;Youth Companion&quot; readers, and in the 1960s, the readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; as one of the best children&#x27;s books. Surveys of adult readers in the 1970s and 1980s show that the novel was a frequent childhood favorite, especially for women.

Burnett&#x27;s literary reputation underwent a critical resurgence in the 1950s. Marghanita Laski&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Ewing, Mrs Molesworth and Mrs Hodgson Burnett&quot; (1951) described &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, &quot;A Little Princess&quot;, and &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; as the best of Burnett&#x27;s children&#x27;s books; Laski considered &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; to be the best of the three, with a capacity to reach thoughtful and self-reflective children. Other British literary critics and historians began to take note of the novel, including Roger Lancelyn Green and John Rowe Townsend. Thwaite&#x27;s biography about Burnett, &quot;Waiting for the Party&quot; (1974), highlighted &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; for its depiction of unpleasant children that she felt was much closer to contemporary ideas about how children behave. At the time that Thwaite&#x27;s biography was published, children&#x27;s literature was becoming a field of greater scholarly interest, and as a result, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; began to garner more scholarly analysis. &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; became accepted as part of the scholarly canon of children&#x27;s literature in the 1980s.

In the twentieth-first century, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; continues to be well regarded among readers. In 2003 it ranked No. 51 in The Big Read, a survey of the British public by the BBC to identify the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best-loved Novel&quot; (not just children&#x27;s novel). Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012, it was ranked No. 15 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with a primarily US audience. &quot;A Little Princess&quot; was ranked number 56 and &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; did not make the Top 100. Jeffrey Masson considers &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; &quot;one of the greatest books ever written for children&quot;. In an oblique compliment, Barbara Sleigh has her title character reading &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; on the train at the beginning of her children&#x27;s novel &quot;Jessamy&quot; and Roald Dahl, in his children&#x27;s book &quot;Matilda&quot;, has his title character say that she liked &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; best of all the children&#x27;s books in the library.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

The first motion picture version was made in 1918 by the Famous Players–Lasky Corporation, with 14-year-old Lila Lee as Mary and Paul Willis as Dickon. The film is believed lost.

In 1949, MGM filmed the second adaptation, which starred Margaret O&#x27;Brien as Mary, Dean Stockwell as Colin and Brian Roper as Dickon. This version was mainly black-and-white, but with all of the sequences set in the garden filmed in Technicolor. Noel Streatfeild&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;The Painted Garden&quot; was inspired by the making of this film.

American Zoetrope&#x27;s 1993 production was directed by Agnieszka Holland with a screenplay by Caroline Thompson and starred Kate Maberly as Mary, Heydon Prowse as Colin, Andrew Knott as Dickon, John Lynch as Lord Craven and Dame Maggie Smith as Mrs Medlock. The executive producer was Francis Ford Coppola.

A 2017 production by Dogwood Motion Picture Company is available on the BYUtv Network. A science fiction adaptation in the Victorian style, it was filmed, directed and written for the screen by Owen Smith.

The 2020 film version from Heyday Films and StudioCanal is directed by Marc Munden with a screenplay by Jack Thorne.

===Television===
Dorothea Brooking adapted the book for BBC television on several occasions;in 1952, 1960 and 1975.

&quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; filmed a TV movie adaptation of the novel in 1987, which starred Gennie James as Mary, Barret Oliver as Dickon and Jadrien Steele as Colin. Billie Whitelaw appeared as Mrs Medlock and Derek Jacobi played the role of Archibald Craven, with Alison Doody appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; Colin Firth made a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven. The story was changed slightly. Colin&#x27;s father, instead of being Mary&#x27;s uncle, was now an old friend of Mary&#x27;s father, allowing Colin and Mary to begin a relationship as adults by the film&#x27;s end. It was filmed at Highclere Castle, which later became known as the filming location for &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. It aired on 30 November. In 2001, Hallmark produced a sequel entitled &quot;Back to the Secret Garden&quot;.

A 1994 animated adaptation as an &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot; starred Honor Blackman as Mrs Medlock, Derek Jacobi as Archibald Craven, Glynis Johns as Darjeeling, Victor Spinetti as Dr. Craven, Anndi McAfee as Mary Lennox, Joe Baker as Ben Weatherstaff, Felix Bell as Dickon Sowerby, Naomi Bell as Martha Sowerby, Richard Stuart as Colin Craven and Frank Welker as Robin. This version was produced by Mike Young Productions and DiC Entertainment, and was released on video in 1995 by ABC Video and distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment.

In Japan, NHK produced an anime adaptation of the novel in 1991–1992 entitled &quot;Anime Himitsu no Hanazono&quot; (アニメ ひみつの花園). Miina Tominaga contributed the voice of Mary, while Mayumi Tanaka voiced Colin. The 39-episode TV series was directed by Tameo Kohanawa and written by Kaoru Umeno. This anime is sometimes mistakenly assumed to be related to the popular dorama series &quot;Himitsu no Hanazono&quot;. It is unavailable in English language, but has been dubbed into several other languages including: Arabic, Spanish, Italian, Polish and Tagalog.

===Theatre===

Stage adaptations of the book include a Theatre for Young Audiences version written in 1991 by Pamela Sterling of Arizona State University. This won an American Alliance for Theater and Education &quot;Distinguished New Play&quot; award and is listed in ASSITEH/USA&#x27;s &quot;International Bibliography of Outstanding Plays for Young Audiences&quot;.

Multiple musical adaptations have been made. In 1986, there was &quot;The Secret Garden: A New Musical&quot; with music by Sharon Burgett and Susan Beckwith-Smith, lyrics by Sharon Burgett, Diana Matterson, Susan Beckwith-Smith, Chandler Warren, Will Holt, and book by Alfred Shaughnessy. Another version was released in 1987 with the book and lyrics by Diana Morgan. Thomas W. Olson wrote a version for the Children&#x27;s Theatre Company in 1988; the play includes music by Hiram Titus, but is not a musical. However, the most well-known and successful musical adaptation is the 1991 Broadway musical with music by Lucy Simon and book and lyrics by Marsha Norman. The production was nominated for seven Tony Awards, winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical for Daisy Eagan as Mary, then eleven years old.

In 2013, an opera by the American composer Nolan Gasser, which had been commissioned by the San Francisco Opera, was first performed at the Zellerbach Hall at the University of California, Berkeley.

A stage play by Jessica Swale adapted from the novel was performed at Grosvenor Park Open Air Theatre in Chester in 2014.

In 2020, the Scottish family theatre company Red Bridge Arts produced a retelling of the story set in modern-day Scotland, adapted by Rosalind Sydney.

In 2024, Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre produced a retelling of the story, adapted by Anna Himali Howard and Holly Robinson.

=== Radio ===
In 1997, Focus On The Family Radio Theatre produced an adaptation in which Joan Plowright narrated as the older Mary Lennox. The cast included Ron Moody as Ben Weatherstaff.

=== Book forms and sequels ===
In 2021, two versions of the story, adapted into graphic novels, were released. The first, released on June 15, was &quot;The Secret Garden: A Graphic Novel&quot;, with story by Mariah Marsden and illustrations by Hanna Luechtefeld. The second, released on October 19, was a modern retelling by Ivy Noelle Weir, &quot;The Secret Garden on 81st Street&quot;, following the same vein as the author&#x27;s previous &quot;Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy&quot;. A Japanese-language adaptation of the novel was written by Chihiro Kurihara and illustrated by You Shiina and was released in October 2012 through Tsubasa Bunko.

<doc id="410879" wikidata="Q1485661" url="?curid=410879" title="GIS file format">
<text>A GIS file format is a standard for encoding geographical information into a computer file, as a specialized type of file format for use in geographic information systems (GIS) and other geospatial applications. Since the 1970s, dozens of formats have been created based on various data models for various purposes. They have been created by government mapping agencies (such as the USGS or National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), GIS software vendors, standards bodies such as the Open Geospatial Consortium, informal user communities, and even individual developers.

==History==
The first GIS installations of the 1960s, such as the Canada Geographic Information System were based on bespoke software and stored data in bespoke file structures designed for the needs of the particular project. As more of these appeared, they could be compared to find best practices and common structures. When general-purpose GIS software was developed in the 1970s and early 1980s, including programs from academic labs such as the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, government agencies (e.g., the Map Overlay and Statistical System (MOSS) developed by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management), and new GIS software companies such as Esri and Intergraph, each program was built around its own proprietary (and often secret) file format. Since each GIS installation was effectively isolated from all others, interchange between them was not a major consideration.

By the early 1990s, the proliferation of GIS worldwide and an increasing need for sharing data, soon accelerated by the emergence of the World Wide Web and spatial data infrastructures, led to the need for interoperable data and standard formats. An early attempt at standardization was the U.S. Spatial Data Transfer Standard, released in 1994 and designed to encode the wide variety of federal government data. Although this particular format failed to garner widespread support, it led to other standardization efforts, especially the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which has developed or adopted several vendor-neutral standards, some of which have been adopted by the International Standards Organization (ISO).

Another development in the 1990s was the public release of proprietary file formats by GIS software vendors, enabling them to be used by other software. The most notable example of this was the publication of the Esri Shapefile format, which by the late 1990s had become the most popular &quot;de facto&quot; standard for data sharing by the entire geospatial industry. When proprietary formats were not shared (for example, the ESRI ARC/INFO coverage), software developers frequently reverse-engineered them to enable import and export in other software, further facilitating data exchange. One result of this was the emergence of free and open-source software libraries, such as the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), which have greatly facilitated the integration of spatial data in any format into a variety of software.

During the 2000s, the need for specialized spatial files was reduced somewhat by the emergence of spatial databases, which incorporated spatial data into general-purpose relational databases. However, new file formats have continued to appear, especially with the proliferation of web mapping; formats such as the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) and GeoJSON can be more easily integrated into web development languages than traditional GIS files.

==Format characteristics==
Over a hundred distinct formats have been created for the storage of spatial data, of which 20-30 are currently in common usage for different purposes. These can be distinguished in a number of ways:
* &quot;Open&quot; formats are developed collectively by a community and are available for anyone to implement and contribute improvements, while &quot;Proprietary&quot; formats have been developed by a software company for use only in their own software and are generally maintained as a trade secret (although they are often reverse-engineered by others). A third category between these would include formats that are owned exclusively by one company or organization, but are published and available for implementation by anyone, such as the Esri Shapefile.
* Some file formats are &quot;text files&quot; that can be read by humans (such as those based on XML or JSON), especially those intended for data exchange, while others are &quot;binary files&quot;, most commonly those designed for native use in GIS software.
* &quot;Inherently spatial&quot; formats were designed specifically for storing geographic data, while others are &quot;spatial extensions&quot; to formats designed for a more general use (e.g., GeoTIFF, spatial databases).
* Many data formats incorporate some form of &quot;data compression&quot;, especially raster files. Generally, lossless compression methods are preferable over lossy methods, because the original data values need to be retrieved.

==Raster formats==
Like any digital image, raster GIS data is based on a regular tessellation of space into a rectangular grid of rows and columns of &quot;cells&quot; (also known as pixels), with each cell having a measured value stored. The major difference from a photograph is that the grid is registered to geographic space rather than a field of view. The resolution of the raster data set is its cell width in ground units.

Because a grid is a sample of a continuous space, raster data is most commonly used to represent geographic fields, in which a property varies continuously or discretely over space. Common examples include remote sensing imagery, terrain/elevation, population density, weather and climate, soil properties, and many others. Raster data can be images with each pixel (or cell) containing a color value. The value recorded for each cell may be of any level of measurement, including a discrete qualitative value, such as land use type, or a continuous quantitative value, such as temperature, or a null value if no data is available. While a raster cell stores a single value, it can be extended by using raster bands to represent RGB (red, green, blue) colors, colormaps (a mapping between a thematic code and RGB value), or an extended attribute table with one row for each unique cell value. It can also be used to represent discrete Geographic features, but usually only in exigent circumstances.

Raster data is stored in various formats; from a standard file-based structure of TIFF, JPEG, etc. to binary large object (BLOB) data stored directly in a relational database management system (RDBMS) similar to other vector-based feature classes. Database storage, when properly indexed, typically allows for quicker retrieval of the raster data but can require storage of millions of significantly sized records.

==Vector formats==

A &quot;vector&quot; dataset (sometimes called a &quot;feature&quot; dataset) stores information about discrete objects, using an encoding of the vector logical data model to represent the location or &quot;geometry&quot; of each object, and an encoding of its other properties that is usually based on relational database technology. Typically, a single dataset collects information about a set of closely related or similar objects, such as all of the roads in a city.

The Vector data model uses coordinate geometry to represent each shape as one of several geometric primitives, most commonly &quot;points&quot; (a single coordinate of zero dimension), &quot;lines&quot; (a one-dimensional ordered list of coordinates connected by straight lines), and &quot;polygons&quot; (a self-closing boundary line enclosing a two-dimensional region). Many data structures have been developed to encode these primitives as digital data, but most modern vector file formats are based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Simple Features specification, often directly incorporating its Well-known text (WKT) or Well-known binary (WKB) encodings.

In addition to the geometry of each object, a vector dataset must also be able to store its &quot;attributes&quot;. For example, a database that describes lakes may contain each lake&#x27;s depth, water quality, and pollution level. Since the 1970s, almost all vector file formats have adopted the relational database model, either in principle or directly incorporating RDBMS software. Thus, the entire dataset is stored in a &quot;table&quot;, with each &quot;row&quot; representing a single object that contains &quot;columns&quot; for each attribute.

Two strategies have been used to integrate the geometry and attributes into a single vector file format structure:
* A &quot;georelational format&quot; stores them as two separate files, with the geometry and attributes of each object being linked by file ordering or a primary key. This was most common from the 1970s through the early 1990s, because GIS software developers had to invent their own geometry data structures, but incorporated existing relational database file formats for the attributes. For example, the Esri Shapefile format includes the .dbf file from the DOS dBase software.
* The &quot;Object-based model&quot; stores them in a single structure, loosely or directly based on the objects in object-oriented programming languages. This is the basis of most modern file formats, including spatial databases that include a geometry column along with the other attributes in a single relational table. Other formats, such as GeoJSON, use different structures for geometry and attributes, but combine them for each object in the same file.

Geospatial topology is often an important part of vector data, representing the inherent spatial relationships (especially adjacency) between objects. Topology has been managed in vector file formats in four ways. In a &quot;topological data structure&quot;, most notably Harvard&#x27;s POLYVRT and its successor the ARC/INFO coverage, topological connections between points, lines, and polygons are an inherent part of the encoding of those features. Conversely, non-topological or &quot;spaghetti data&quot; (such as the Esri Shapefile and most spatial databases) includes no topology information, with each geometry being completely independent of all others. A &quot;topology dataset&quot; (often used in network analysis) augments spaghetti data with a separate file encoding the topological connections. A &quot;topology rulebase&quot; is a list of desired topology rules used to enforce spatial integrity in spaghetti data, such as &quot;county polygons must not overlap&quot; and &quot;state polygons must share boundaries with county polygons.&quot;

Vector datasets usually represent discrete geographical features, such as buildings, trees, and counties. However, they may also be used to represent geographical fields by storing locations where the spatially continuous field has been sampled. Sample points (e.g., weather stations and sensor networks), Contour lines and triangulated irregular networks (TIN) are used to represent elevation or other values that change continuously over space. TINs record values at point locations, which are connected by lines to form an irregular mesh of triangles. The face of the triangles represent the terrain surface.

===Example vector file formats===

==Advantages and disadvantages==

There are some important advantages and disadvantages to using a raster or vector data model to represent reality:
* Raster datasets record a value for all points in the area covered which may require more storage space than representing data in a vector format that can store data only where needed.
* Raster data is computationally less expensive to render than vector graphics
* Combining values and writing custom formulas for combining values from different layers are much easier using raster data.
* There are transparency and aliasing problems when overlaying multiple stacked pieces of raster images.
* Vector data allows for visually smooth and easy implementation of overlay operations, especially in terms of graphics and shape-driven information like maps, routes and custom fonts, which are more difficult with raster data.
* Vector data can be displayed as vector graphics used on traditional maps, whereas raster data will appear as an image that may have a blocky appearance for object boundaries. (depending on the resolution of the raster file).
* Vector data can be easier to register, scale, and re-project, which can simplify combining vector layers from different sources.
* Vector data is more compatible with relational database environments, where they can be part of a relational table as a normal column and processed using a multitude of operators.
* Vector file sizes are usually smaller than raster data, which can be tens, hundreds or more times larger than vector data (depending on resolution).
* Vector data is simpler to update and maintain, whereas a raster image will have to be completely reproduced. (Example: a new road is added).
* Vector data allows much more analysis capability, especially for &quot;networks&quot; such as roads, power, rail, telecommunications, etc. (Examples: Best route, largest port, airfields connected to two-lane highways). Raster data will not have all the characteristics of the features it displays.

==Integrated file formats==
Modern object–relational databases can now store a variety of complex data using the binary large object datatype, including both raster grids and vector geometries. This enables some spatial database systems to store data of both models in the same database.
*Esri File Geodatabase - A proprietary format for storing &quot;feature&quot; (vector) and raster data locally
*Esri Enterprise Geodatabase - A proprietary model for storing a geodatabase structure in a variety of commercial and open-source relational database management systems
*GeoPackage (GPKG) – A standards-based, open format based on the SQLite database format for both vector and raster data, adopted by the Open Geospatial Consortium

<doc id="410883" wikidata="Q2084424" url="?curid=410883" title="Maurice Noble">
<text>Maurice James Noble (May 1, 1911 – May 18, 2001) was an American animation production designer, background artist and layout designer whose contributions to the industry spanned more than 60 years. He was a long-time associate and right-hand man of animation director Chuck Jones, especially at Warner Bros. in the 1950s and early 1960s, during which he served as Jones&#x27; layout artist and eventual co-director. His work contributed to such cartoon classics as &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and the Road Runner series.

==Early life and Disney years==
Maurice Noble was born in Spooner Township, Minnesota. He spent much of his childhood in New Mexico and Southern California. In the early 1930s he attended the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, and while there the Institute displayed his works in its first one-man show of watercolors. Having to leave Chouinard for financial reasons, he ended up doing design work for a department store.

A Disney scout recruited him around 1934, and he decided to accept the job since it paid $10 per month more than the department store did. Noble was put to work on backgrounds for the Silly Symphonies cartoon series. At that time the Disney backgrounds were required to be done in transparent watercolor wash, which was technically difficult because correcting a mistake was usually impossible, requiring a full new attempt.

&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was the first feature-length film Noble worked on. This was followed by background work on other Disney features, notably the Rite of Spring sequence in &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Noble also did story development for the Dance of the Hours in that film. For &quot;Dumbo&quot;, he did color coordination and character design, including work on the pink elephant sequence.

Noble joined the Disney animators&#x27; strike in 1941; it lasted five weeks and became bitter. When he returned after the strike was settled, his office was moved to an ex-broomcloset and he was left without assignments. Soon he was laid off and his career at Disney was at an end.

The outbreak of World War II led Noble to enlist in the Army Signal Corps. He was eventually assigned to a small unit headed by Ted Geisel (better known as Dr. Seuss). The unit was based at the Fox studios and under Col. Frank Capra. It worked on posters and booklets, and on a cartoon series called Private Snafu. The unit did the writing, storyboards, and background designs; the cartoon production was contracted out. Warner Bros. won the contract for Private Snafu, and the WB animation director Chuck Jones worked on the series. Following the war Noble did freelance work in the industry and then took a position doing art for a filmstrip production company in St. Louis.

==The Warner Bros. years==
Noble remained in St. Louis until 1950, when he was invited to come to Warner Bros. to do cartoon layout for Chuck Jones&#x27; group, beginning with the short &quot;Rabbit Seasoning&quot;. This was the first time he had done layout, which consists of designing the background environment and, for each shot, the particular viewpoint. The layout drawings and colorations are then used by the background artist (often Philip DeGuard) to paint the final backgrounds (see &quot;Chuck Amuck&quot;, p. 148 for an example).

At Warner Bros., Noble worked with Jones for a decade, over which time the team did over 60 cartoons. Turning away from the realism of Disney backgrounds, Noble grew into styles using shape and color to define the space. The graphic look of his backgrounds could vary widely from film to film; he tried to make the backdrop fit the mood of the film. Noble says:
:&quot;I call it stepping into the picture. You look around and say, &#x27;Gee, what&#x27;s this all about, and does it feel right for this given picture?&#x27; And then you go ahead and design from that standpoint.&quot;
The Jones unit worked with many of Warners characters: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Road Runner &amp; Coyote. Noble&#x27;s wide-open desert landscapes gave the Road Runner cartoons their characteristic spaciousness. The cartoons Noble designed at Warners include &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (1957), a Bugs Bunny parody of Wagner&#x27;s Ring Cycle that has been inducted into the National Film Registry. Noble&#x27;s futuristic settings enhance &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; (1953). Other cartoons included the Academy Award nominees &quot;From A to Z-Z-Z-Z&quot; (1954), &quot;High Note&quot; (1960), &quot;Beep Prepared&quot; (1961), &quot;Nelly&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1961), and &quot;Now Hear This&quot; (1962).

A break of about a year came during this period, when Noble spent time working on industrial films for John Sutherland&#x27;s studio in the wake of Warner Bros. shutting down their cartoon unit, and did not return immediately upon the studio re-opening. In this period, Jones had his layouts created first by former Disney artist Ernie Nordli, who used an even more abstract (albeit less consistent) style than Noble, and then later by Noble&#x27;s predecessor, Robert Gribbroek, who largely discarded the styles used by Noble and Nordli, and reverted to the look of Jones&#x27; earlier cartoons. Eventually, Jones coaxed Noble into returning to Warner Bros., and the two men would work together for the next few decades.

In the early 1960s, Noble started receiving co-director credit on a number of the Jones-unit productions. This reflected his increased involvement in many phases of the creation process beyond just the layouts, pulling things together and ironing out rough spots.

==MGM and Dr. Seuss==
In 1963, after Chuck Jones was sacked by Warner Bros., Noble left Warner Bros. and joined Jones at Tower 12 Productions (also called Sib-Tower 12). This new company had a contract with MGM, and eventually became the animation unit of MGM.

The bread-and-butter work for the first couple of years was producing cartoons starring MGM&#x27;s Tom and Jerry characters, but there were an assortment of other projects. One was &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; (1964), a combined live action &amp; animation feature. Noble co-directed &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; (1965) which won the Oscar for short subject (cartoon). He also designed the 1970 feature &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;.

Noble started working again with Ted Geisel for the first time since the war, responsible for the designs used in the TV feature &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (1966). He later did design and layout work on a number of other Dr. Seuss features, first at MGM (&quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (1970)), and then at the DePatie-Freleng studios (e.g. &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (1971), &quot;The Lorax&quot; (1972), &quot;Dr. Seuss on the Loose&quot; (1973)).

==Later years==
In the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, Noble largely withdrew from work in the animation industry to pursue other interests. These included producing fine art, particularly hand-pulled silkscreen prints. In 1987, he received a lifetime achievement Annie Award (from the International Animation Society) for his contributions over the previous 50 years.

About 1989, Noble did development work on Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, and did writing and design for the &quot;Duck Dodgers Jr.&quot; in an episode of &quot;The Return of the Acme Acres Zone&quot; (1990).

In the mid-1990s, Noble rejoined Jones at Chuck Jones Film Productions, serving as art director on &quot;Chariots of Fur&quot; (1994) and color consultant on several other productions, including &quot;Pullet Surprise&quot;.

While at the Jones studio, Noble began supervising, training, and mentoring young artists just out of (or still in) school. These artists came to be known as the &#x27;Noble boys and girls&#x27;. Many of them became involved in &quot;Noble Tales,&quot; a planned series of animated shorts based on folk tales. One such film was &quot;Al Tudi Tuhak&quot; (1999).

Noble continued to be active in a variety of animation projects, including consultation with Disney artists for their first watercolor backgrounds in half a century (for &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;). Noble died on May 18, 2001, at his home in La Crescenta, California, 17 days after his 90th birthday.

<text>James Edward McGreevey (born August 6, 1957) is an American politician who served as the 52nd governor of New Jersey from 2002 until his resignation in 2004.

McGreevey served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1990 to 1992, as the 19th mayor of Woodbridge Township from 1991 to 2002, and in the New Jersey Senate from 1994 to 1998. He was the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Jersey in 1997, but was narrowly defeated by Republican incumbent Christine Todd Whitman. He ran for governor again in 2001 and was elected by a large margin.

During his gubernatorial tenure, McGreevey—who was then married to Dina Matos—appointed Israeli national Golan Cipel as Counselor to the Governor, advising on homeland security. On August 12, 2004, following threats of a sexual harassment lawsuit from Cipel, McGreevey publicly acknowledged his homosexuality and stated that he had engaged in an extramarital relationship; he also announced that he would resign the governorship effective November 15, 2004.

In 2006, following his departure from public office, McGreevey published a memoir entitled &quot;The Confession&quot;. He later pursued ordination in the Episcopal Church and obtained a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree from General Theological Seminary in New York City; however, the Episcopal Church declined to ordain him and he later returned to the Catholic Church. In July 2013, McGreevey was appointed head of Jersey City&#x27;s Employment &amp; Training Program (JCETP). He served in that capacity until his 2019 termination. McGreevey serves as Executive Director of the New Jersey Reentry Corporation.

==Early life and education==
McGreevey was born in Jersey City, the son of Veronica, a nurse, and Jack McGreevey, a Marine drill instructor who served in World War II and the Korean War. His family was Irish Catholic, and he grew up in nearby Carteret. There he attended St. Joseph Elementary School, and St. Joseph High School in Metuchen. He attended The Catholic University of America before graduating from Columbia University in 1978. He earned a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1981 and a master&#x27;s degree in education from Harvard University in 1982. He also attended a summer diploma program in law at the London School of Economics.

==Career==
Prior to entering politics, McGreevey was an assistant prosecutor and executive director of the state Parole Board. McGreevey has taught ethics, law and leadership at Kean University in Union, New Jersey.

McGreevey was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the 19th Legislative District from 1990 to 1992, when he became Mayor of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. He was re-elected mayor in 1995 and 1999. He was elected to the New Jersey Senate in 1993, simultaneously serving as mayor during the four-year Senate term.

===Governorship of New Jersey===
McGreevey first ran for governor in 1997, but was defeated in a close race (47% to 46%) by the incumbent Republican Christine Todd Whitman. Libertarian candidate Murray Sabrin received slightly over 5% of the vote. McGreevey ran for the governorship again in 2001 and won with 56% of the vote, making him the first majority-elected governor since James Florio. His Republican opponent in that race was Bret Schundler. Other candidates in the race included William E. Schluter (Independent), Jerry Coleman (Green), Mark Edgerton (Libertarian), Michael Koontz (Conservative), Costantino Rozzo (Socialist) and Kari Sachs (Socialist Workers).

After being elected to the governorship by a large margin on November 6, 2001, McGreevey inherited a $5 billion budget deficit. During his term, McGreevey raised the tax on cigarettes and increased the state income tax for the wealthy. Raised Catholic but maintaining a pro-choice stance on abortion, he stated as governor that he would not receive Communion at public church services.

Among McGreevey&#x27;s accomplishments were auto insurance reform, restructuring the Division of Motor Vehicles to the Motor Vehicle Commission, signing the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act into law, implementing a stem cell research plan for New Jersey, heavily lobbying for the state&#x27;s first domestic partnership law for same-sex couples and signing such a law in early 2004.

====Golan Cipel controversy====

McGreevey met Golan Cipel in Israel during a trip there in 2000. Cipel relocated to the United States to work for McGreevey&#x27;s 2001 gubernatorial campaign as a liaison to the Jewish community.

In 2002, following his election as governor, McGreevey appointed Cipel as Counselor to the Governor at a salary of $110,000. Members of the Legislature questioned the appointment, and it was criticized because Cipel was unqualified for the position. In addition, Cipel could not obtain a security clearance from the federal government, as he was Israeli and not a U.S. citizen; therefore, the FBI and the Secret Service would not provide him with intelligence. 

McGreevey brought up Cipel&#x27;s name six weeks into his administration in a February 14, 2002, interview with &quot;The Record&quot;″s editorial board at its offices, saying:

McGreevey assisted Cipel in obtaining a townhouse near McGreevey&#x27;s home. Cipel reportedly stated that he needed to live near the governor because his job involved being on call on a 24-hour basis. According to the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; newspaper, McGreevey even accompanied Cipel on a final walk-through of the townhouse, which the real estate agent said she found &quot;odd&quot;.

In March 2002, Cipel stepped down from his Homeland Security position and was reassigned to an advisor position regarding government operations. In August 2002, Cipel resigned from the McGreevey administration.

Cipel later threatened to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against McGreevey. This threat led to McGreevey&#x27;s August 2004 resignation from office.

====Other controversies====
David D&#x27;Amiano, a key McGreevey fund-raiser, was ultimately sentenced to two years in prison for extorting $40,000 from a farmer, Mark Halper, a Middlesex County landowner cooperating with investigators. In the 47-page indictment, there are repeated references to the involvement of &quot;State Official 1,&quot; later revealed to be McGreevey. In a conversation with Halper, McGreevey used the word &quot;Machiavelli,&quot; the code allegedly arranged by D&#x27;Amiano intended to assure the farmer that his $40,000 campaign contribution would get him preferential treatment in a dispute over his land.

====Resignation====
On the afternoon of August 12, 2004, faced with threats from Cipel&#x27;s lawyer, Allen Lowy, that Cipel would file a sexual harassment lawsuit against him in Mercer County Court, McGreevey held a press conference. At the press conference, he said: &quot;At a point in every person&#x27;s life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one&#x27;s soul and decide one&#x27;s unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is. And so my truth is that I am a gay American.&quot; He also said that he had &quot;engaged in an adult consensual affair with another man&quot; (whom his aides immediately named as Cipel), and that he would resign effective November 15, 2004. New Jersey political circles had speculated about McGreevey&#x27;s sexual orientation and questions about his relationship with Cipel had been alluded to in the media. McGreevey&#x27;s announcement made him the first openly gay state governor in United States history. &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its &quot;coverage of the resignation of New Jersey&#x27;s governor after he announced he was gay and confessed to adultery with a male lover.&quot; For his part, Cipel later asserted that he was heterosexual and denied having had an affair with McGreevey; Cipel has contended that McGreevey subjected him to sexual harassment and sexual assault and then fired him when his advances were rejected.

McGreevey&#x27;s decision to delay the effective date of his resignation until after September 3, 2004, avoided a special election in November to replace him as governor. Doing so allowed the Democratic Party to retain control of the governorship for the rest of the four-year term, until January 2006. It avoided the prospect of a special election in tandem with the presidential election, which could have resulted in a Republican victory and helped George W. Bush capture New Jersey&#x27;s electoral votes. Bush did not win New Jersey&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, but captured 46 percent of the statewide vote, compared to 40 percent in the 2000 race, and did win re-election.

Almost immediately after McGreevey&#x27;s announcement, New Jersey Republicans and Democrats alike called upon the governor not to wait until November to resign and instead to do so immediately. An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; read, &quot;Mr. McGreevey&#x27;s strategy to delay resignation does not serve New Jersey residents well. The state will be led by an embattled governor mired in personal and legal problems for three months.&quot;

On September 15, U.S. District Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. dismissed &quot;Afran v. McGreevey&quot;, filed by Green Party lawyers Bruce Afran and Carl J. Mayer, dismissing their claim that the postponement of McGreevey&#x27;s resignation had left a vacancy, thereby violating New Jersey residents&#x27; voting rights. Brown stated that McGreevey &quot;clearly intends to hold office until November 15, 2004. The requirement of holding a special election does not arise. The rights of registered voters are not being violated.&quot; Afran re-filed the same suit in Mercer County Superior Court and Judge Linda R. Feinberg heard arguments on October 4, 2004.

Fellow Democrat and New Jersey Senate President Richard Codey took office upon McGreevey&#x27;s resignation and served the remainder of the term until January 17, 2006. At the time of McGreevey&#x27;s resignation, the New Jersey State Constitution stipulated that the Senate president retains that position while serving as acting governor. In the wake of McGreevey&#x27;s resignation, and in consideration of other past New Jersey governors who had left office before the end of their terms, such as Christie Todd Whitman, who had resigned in 2001 when President George W. Bush appointed her to head the EPA, and Governor A. Harry Moore, who resigned in 1935 to serve in the U.S. Senate, voters in New Jersey passed an amendment to the state constitution in 2005 that created the post of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey, effective January 17, 2006. The first election for lieutenant governor was held in 2009.

==Post-gubernatorial activities==
===Memoir===

In September 2006, McGreevey published a memoir, written with assistance from David France as ghostwriter. The memoir was titled &quot;The Confession&quot;. McGreevey appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on September 19, 2006, to discuss and promote the book. It was the start of a two-month promotion of his memoir.

In &quot;The Confession&quot;, McGreevey describes the duality of his life before he came out as gay: &quot;As glorious and meaningful as it would have been to have a loving and sound sexual experience with another man, I knew I&#x27;d have to undo my happiness step by step as I began chasing my dream of a public career and the kind of &#x27;acceptable&#x27; life that went with it. So, instead, I settled for the detached anonymity of bookstores and rest stopsa compromise, but one that was wholly unfulfilling and morally unsatisfactory.&quot; McGreevey also included descriptions of his alleged affair with Golan Cipel. In response, Cipel continued to deny that an affair between the two men occurred.

===Divinity studies and community-building===

McGreevey and his partner Mark O&#x27;Donnell regularly attended Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York, in addition to a local parish in New Jersey. At St. Bartholomew&#x27;s, McGreevey was received into the Episcopal Church on Sunday, April 29, 2007. He was accepted to General Theological Seminary, from which he received the degree of Master of Divinity, a prerequisite to becoming an Episcopal priest. In 2009, McGreevey told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he volunteered for Exodus Ministries, where he performed service to former prisoners seeking rehabilitation at the Church of Living Hope in Harlem, New York. On November 16, 2009, WCBS-TV reported that McGreevey was continuing his training at All Saints Episcopal Church in Hoboken. An April 2011 report indicated that McGreevey&#x27;s bid for ordination had been rejected. McGreevey then worked at Integrity House at the Hudson County Correctional Facility with women inmates with a history of drug use.

McGreevey&#x27;s life after politics, his pursuit of the priesthood, and his ministry to prison inmates are covered in a 2013 HBO documentary film, &quot;Fall to Grace&quot;, directed by Alexandra Pelosi.

After some years as an Episcopalian, McGreevey rejoined the Catholic Church. As of 2023, he regularly attended Mass at the Christ the King Catholic Church in Jersey City.

===Jersey City Employment &amp; Training Program===
In July 2013, McGreevey was appointed executive director of Jersey City&#x27;s Employment &amp; Training Program (JCETP). The program, which provides re-entry coaching for those released from prison, along with other services, such as job opportunities and training, and substance abuse rehabilitation is based at The Hub in the city&#x27;s Jackson Hill neighborhood. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop stated that McGreevey was &quot;a valuable asset&quot; to have in this position.

Among those at the September 2014 opening of the facility called Martin&#x27;s Place (located on the major street of Martin Luther King Drive) were Brendan Byrne, Tom Kean, Steve Fulop, Chris Christie, Robert Menendez, Nancy Pelosi and Cornell William Brooks. The prisoner re-entry program, funded by the New Jersey Parole Board with a $4.2 million grant, is located in Sacred Heart Church, also in the neighborhood.

In January 2019, the board of the JCETP voted to terminate McGreevey&#x27;s employment. A forensic audit suggested that funds had been inappropriately re-directed to another program, NJ ReEntry. McGreevey claimed that the move was political and asserted that eight independent audits found no wrongdoing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey, McGreevey sought to place early-release prisoners, many of whom were homeless, in makeshift shelters.

===New Jersey Reentry Corporation (NJRC)===
McGreevey serves as Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of the New Jersey Reentry Corporation (NJRC).

==Potential return to politics==
In October 2015, McGreevey moved from Plainfield to Jersey City, sparking rumors that he might run for mayor. In 2023, with mayor Steven Fulop retiring to run for governor, McGreevey&#x27;s name was floated among potential candidates to succeed him, with the Union City mayor and State Senator Brian P. Stack endorsing his potential bid. He filed to run for election on October 31, 2023.

==Personal life==
McGreevey has a daughter from his first marriage (1991–1997) to Canadian Karen Joan Schutz and another daughter from his second marriage to Portuguese-born Dina Matos. When he resigned from office in 2004, McGreevey asserted that he had engaged in an adulterous affair with another man; he later stated that he had had an affair with Golan Cipel. Cipel has denied that an affair between the two men occurred.

Matos and McGreevey separated after he revealed that he is gay, and in late 2005 McGreevey and Australian-American executive Mark O&#x27;Donnell began a relationship. The two lived in Plainfield, New Jersey. On March 14, 2007, the Associated Press reported that McGreevey was seeking custody of his younger daughter and filing for child support. Matos demanded $600,000 plus alimony. On August 8, the divorce was granted. McGreevey received joint custody and was directed to pay child support. Matos was denied alimony. In her memoirs, Matos wrote that she would never have married McGreevey if she had known he was gay, nor would she have chosen to have a gay man father her child.

<text>Kathy Boudin (May 19, 1943 – May 1, 2022) was an American radical leftist who served 23 years in prison for felony murder based on her role in the 1981 Brink&#x27;s robbery. Boudin was a founding member of the militant Weather Underground organization, which engaged in bombings of government buildings to express opposition to U.S. foreign policy and racism. The 1981 robbery resulted in the killing of two Nyack, New York police officers and one security guard, and serious injury to another security guard; Boudin was arrested attempting to flee after the getaway vehicle she occupied was stopped by police. She was released on parole in 2003. After earning a doctorate, Boudin became an adjunct professor at Columbia University.

==Early life and family==
Kathy Boudin was born in Manhattan on May 19, 1943, into a Jewish family with a storied left-wing history. Boudin was raised in Greenwich Village, New York City. Her paternal grandparents had emigrated from Russia and Austria. Her great-uncle was Marxist theorist Louis B. Boudin, while her brother is former U.S. Judge Michael Boudin. Her mother was poet Jean (Roisman) Boudin, whose sister Esther was married to radical journalist I.F. Stone (making him Kathy&#x27;s uncle). Her father, attorney Leonard Boudin, had represented controversial clients such as Judith Coplon, the Cuban government, and Paul Robeson. A National Lawyers Guild attorney, Leonard Boudin was the law partner of Victor Rabinowitz, himself counsel to numerous left-wing organizations. Kathy Boudin graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1965 as class valedictorian. After college, she attended the Case Western Reserve University School of Law for less than a year.

Boudin met her romantic partner, David Gilbert, in the 1970s and gave birth to their son Chesa Boudin in 1980. When her son was 14 months old, she was arrested and subsequently convicted and incarcerated for felony murder based on her role in the 1981 Brink&#x27;s robbery. Her son was raised by former Weatherman leaders Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn.

==Weather Underground==

In 1969, Boudin was a founding member of the Weatherman faction of Students for a Democratic Society, which in 1970 became the Weather Underground Organization (WUO). In 1970 she and Cathy Wilkerson were the only survivors of the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, when a bomb that their comrades were constructing in the basement, intending to use it to attack U.S. Army personnel that evening, exploded prematurely, killing three of the militants and demolishing the building they were using as a hideout and bomb factory. The WUO soon after renounced actions that sought to inflict human casualties. Boudin remained a fugitive for more than a decade, engaging in multiple additional bombings (none of which resulted in injuries) and other actions. 

In 1981, Boudin and several former members of the Weather Underground, with current members of the May 19th Communist Organization and the Black Liberation Army, robbed a Brink&#x27;s armored car at the Nanuet Mall, in Nanuet, New York. Boudin was in the front seat of a U-Haul truck used as a switchcar getaway vehicle and also acted as a decoy. Responding police testified that when they spotted and pulled her over, Boudin feigned innocence and encouraged the two responding officers put their guns down, whereupon her accomplices leaped from the back of the truck with automatic weapons and shot officers Edward O&#x27;Grady and Waverly Brown, killing them both. In addition to the deaths of O&#x27;Grady and Brown, the robbers had already seriously wounded guard Joseph Trombino; killed his partner, Peter Paige; and injured two other police officers.

===Guilty plea and incarceration===
Boudin was arrested while attempting to flee the scene on foot. As part of a negotiated plea agreement to avoid triple murder convictions, each carrying consecutive 25-year to life convictions, she eventually pleaded guilty to felony murder and robbery for an agreed sentence of a single 20 years to life in prison. While incarcerated, Boudin published articles in the &quot;Harvard Educational Review&quot; (&quot;Participatory Literacy Education Behind Bars: AIDS Opens the Door,&quot; Summer 1993, 63 (2)), in &quot;Breaking the Rules: Women in Prison and Feminist Therapy&quot; by Judy Harden and Marcia Hill (&quot;Lessons from a Mother&#x27;s Program in Prison: A Psychosocial Approach Supports Women and Their Children,&quot; published simultaneously in &quot;Women &amp; Therapy&quot;, 21), and in &quot;Breaking the Walls of Silence: AIDS and Women in a New York State Maximum-Security Prison&quot;. She co-authored &quot;The Foster Care Handbook for Incarcerated Parents&quot; published by Bedford Hills in 1993. She also co-edited &quot;Parenting from inside/out: Voices of mothers in prison&quot;, jointly published by correctional institutions and the Osborne Association. Boudin also co-founded AIDS Committee for Education (ACE) inside the prison in 1988 with other incarcerated women including Katrina Haslip and Judith Alice Clark to provide accurate education on living with HIV.

Boudin also wrote and published poetry while incarcerated, publishing in books and journals including the PEN Center Prize Anthology &quot;Doing Time&quot;, &quot;Concrete Garden&quot;, and &quot;Aliens at the Border&quot;. She won an International PEN prize for her poetry in 1999.

Boudin and Roslyn D. Smith contributed the piece &quot;Alive Behind the Labels: Women in Prison&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

After almost 23 years&#x27; imprisonment, Boudin was granted parole on August 20, 2003, in her third parole hearing. She was released from the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility on September 18, 2003.

==Life after prison==
After her release from prison, Boudin accepted a job in the HIV/AIDS Clinic at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center, meeting the work provisions of parole that required active job prospects. Later, she founded the Coming Home Program at the Spencer Cox Center for Health at Mt. Sinai/St.Luke’s Hospital in Morningside Heights, which provides health care for people returning from incarceration.

In May 2004 Boudin published an essay in the Fellowship of Reconciliation&#x27;s publication &quot;Fellowship&quot;, expressing remorse for her participation in the Brink&#x27;s robbery, which she described as &quot;horrific.&quot; Subsequently, she received an Ed. D. from Columbia University Teachers College. In addition to her work at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt, Boudin worked as a consultant to Osborne Association in the development of a Longtermers Responsibility Project taking place in the New York State Correctional Facilities, utilizing a restorative practice approach, and co-authored the Coming to Terms curriculum used in the program. She also consulted for Vermont Corrections and the Women&#x27;s Prison Association and supervised social workers.

===Columbia University===
Boudin was named an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, where she was the co-director and co-founder of the Center for Justice at Columbia University. Her appointment was controversial due to her guilty plea to a felony murder charge and her past participation in a group which carried out terrorist attacks in the United States. However, an opinion piece in the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; noted that she took responsibility for her crimes and successfully rehabilitated herself. Columbia School of Social Work Associate Dean Marianne Yoshioka, who hired Boudin for the adjunct-professor post in 2008, was quoted as saying that Boudin has been &quot;an excellent teacher who gets incredible evaluations from her students each year.&quot; In 2013, she was Sheinberg Scholar-in-Residence at New York University School of Law. The law school has maintained a video of her lecture.

===In popular culture===
Boudin was a model for the title role in David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;The Anarchist&quot; (2012). She also was a model for Willy Holtzman&#x27;s Off-Broadway play &quot;Something You Did&quot; (2008). Boudin was an inspiration for the character Merry in Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;American Pastoral&quot;.

==Death==
On May 1, 2022, Boudin died in New York City at the age of 78, a day after returning from a visit to San Francisco. According to her son Chesa Boudin, who was serving as District Attorney of San Francisco, Boudin had been battling cancer for seven years.

<doc id="410898" wikidata="Q524782" url="?curid=410898" title="Desmond Bagley">
<text>Desmond Bagley (29 October 1923 – 12 April 1983) was an English journalist and novelist known mainly for a series of bestselling thrillers. He and fellow British writers such as Hammond Innes and Alistair MacLean set conventions for the genre: a tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary hero pitted against villains determined to sow destruction and chaos for their own ends.

==Biography==
Bagley was born in Kendal, Westmorland – now in Cumbria – as the son of John and Hannah Bagley. His family moved to the resort town of Blackpool in the summer of 1935, when Bagley was 12. Leaving school not long after the move, Bagley worked as a printer&#x27;s assistant and factory worker, and during the Second World War in the aircraft industry. Bagley had a stutter all of his life, which initially exempted him from military conscription.

Bagley left England in 1947 for Africa and worked his way overland, crossing the Sahara Desert and briefly settling in Kampala, Uganda, where he contracted malaria. By 1951, he had settled in South Africa, working in the gold mining and asbestos industries in Durban, Natal, before becoming a freelance writer for local newspapers and magazines. While there he met a local bookstore director, Joan Margaret Brown, whom he married in 1960.

In an afterword to his novel &quot;Windfall&quot;, Bagley describes how as a freelancer for the Johannesburg &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, he witnessed the 1960 assassination attempt against South African PM Hendrik Verwoerd.

When not travelling to research the exotic backgrounds for his novels, Bagley enjoyed sailing, loved classical music, films and military history, and played war games.

Bagley and his wife left South Africa for England in 1964, where they lived in Bishopsteignton, Devon. They settled in Totnes, Devon, from 1966 to 1976, and then moved to Guernsey until his death in 1983. Thereafter his wife continued to live there until her death in 1999.

Bagley died on 12 April 1983 at a hospital in Southampton of complications resulting from a stroke. He was 59.

==Writings==
Bagley&#x27;s first published short story appeared in the English magazine &quot;Argosy&quot; in 1957, and his first novel, &quot;The Golden Keel&quot;, in 1963. Between whiles he was a film critic for &quot;The Rand Daily Mail&quot; in Johannesburg from 1958 to 1962.

The success of &quot;The Golden Keel&quot; had led Bagley to turn to full-time novel writing by the mid-1960s. He produced a total of 16 thrillers, all craftsman-like and almost all bestsellers. Typically of British thriller writers of that period, he rarely used recurring characters in different books. Exceptions include Max Stafford (a security consultant featured in &quot;Flyaway&quot; and &quot;Windfall)&quot;, Slade (a spy who appeared in &quot;Running Blind&quot; and &quot;The Freedom Trap&quot;), and Metcalfe (a smuggler/mercenary in &quot;The Golden Keel&quot; and &quot;The Spoilers&quot;). His work yielded five mostly unremarkable film adaptations: &quot;The Freedom Trap&quot; (1971), released in 1973 as &quot;The Mackintosh Man&quot; by Warner Brothers, directed by John Huston and starring Paul Newman and Dominique Sanda; &quot;Landslide&quot;, made for television in 1992; &quot;The Vivero Letter&quot;, filmed in 1998; and &quot;The Enemy&quot;, starring Roger Moore in 2001. Probably the most successful adaptation was &quot;Running Blind&quot;, serialised for television by the BBC in 1979.

In several novels Bagley used the first-person narrative. One critic wrote, &quot;As long as meticulous craftsmanship and honest entertainment are valued, and as long as action, authenticity, and expertise still make up the strong framework of the good adventure/thriller, Desmond Bagley&#x27;s books will surely be read.&quot;

Bagley also published short stories. His last two novels, &quot;Night of Error&quot; and &quot;Juggernaut&quot;, were published posthumously after completion by his wife. His works have been translated into over 20 languages.

In 2017, an unpublished first-draft manuscript entitled &quot;Because Salton Died&quot; was discovered among his papers at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center in Boston, Massachusetts. A complete final draft was subsequently prepared by writer Michael Davies, which was retitled &quot;Domino Island&quot; and published by HarperCollins on 9 May 2019.

Also discovered among the author&#x27;s papers was an incomplete and unpublished draft manuscript entitled &quot;Writer – An Enquiry into a Novelist&quot;. In 2021 this autobiographical account of Bagley&#x27;s early life and formative influences was edited and published, as a free eBook, by Philip Eastwood.

At the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2022, HarperCollins announced they had acquired Bagley&#x27;s catalogue from Brockhurst Publications, which had previously been responsible for managing the author&#x27;s estate. Alongside the deal, publisher David Brawn revealed that a new original novel – written by Michael Davies as a &#x27;sequel&#x27; to &quot;Domino Island&quot; and using the same protagonist, Bill Kemp – would be published as a centenary tribute to Bagley. The novel, entitled &quot;Outback&quot;, was published on 11 May 2023. A further sequel, &quot;Thin Ice&quot;, has been announced for publication in 2024.

A blue plaque was unveiled in October 2023 at Bagley&#x27;s childhood home in Lord Street, Blackpool, to mark the centenary of his birth. The plaque is the second in his honour, the first having been unveiled at his Guernsey home in 2018, which jointly honoured the author together with his wife Joan Bagley, for their significant contribution to Guernsey society.

==Bibliography==
The dates are for the first UK hardcover publication; all Bagley&#x27;s novels subsequently appeared in paperback.

<text>Therbligs are elemental motions used in the study of motion economy. A workplace task is analyzed by recording each of the therblig units for a process, with the results used for optimization of manual labour by eliminating unneeded movements. Eighteen therbligs have been defined.

The word &quot;therblig&quot; was the creation of Frank Bunker Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth, American industrial psychologists who invented the field of time and motion study. It is a reversal of the name &quot;Gilbreth&quot;, with &#x27;th&#x27; .

== Elements ==
A basic motion element is one of a set of fundamental motions used by a worker to perform a manual operation or task. The set consists of 18 elements, each describing one activity.

* Transport empty [unloaded] (TE): receiving an object with an empty hand. (Now called &quot;Reach&quot;.)
* Grasp (G): grasping an object with the active hand.
* Transport loaded (TL): moving an object using a hand motion.
* Hold (H): holding an object.
* Release load (RL): releasing control of an object.
* Pre-position (PP): positioning and/or orienting an object for the next operation and relative to an approximation location.
* Position (P): positioning and/or orienting an object in the defined location.
* Use (U): manipulating a tool in the intended way during the course of working.
* Assemble (A): joining two parts together.
* Disassemble (DA): separating multiple components that were joined. 
* Search (Sh): attempting to find an object using the eyes and hands.
* Select (St): Choosing among several objects in a group.
* Plan (Pn): deciding on a course of action.
* Inspect (I): determining the quality or the characteristics of an object using the eyes and/or other senses.
*Unavoidable delay (UD): waiting due to factors beyond the worker&#x27;s control and included in the work cycle.
* Avoidable delay (AD): pausing for reasons under the worker&#x27;s control that is not part of the regular work cycle.
* Rest (R): resting to overcome a fatigue, consisting of a pause in the motions of the hands and/or body during the work cycles or between them.
* Find (F): A momentary mental reaction at the end of the Search cycle. Seldom used.

== Effective and ineffective basic motion elements ==
Effective:
* Reach
* Move
* Grasp
* Release Load
* Use
* Assemble
* Disassemble
* Pre-Position

Ineffective:
* Hold
* Rest
* Position
* Search
* Select
* Plan
* Unavoidable Delay
* Avoidable Delay
* Inspect
==Sample usage==
Here is an example of how therbligs can be used to analyze motion:

==History==

In an article published in 1915, Frank Gilbreth wrote of 16 elements: &quot;The elements of a cycle of decisions and motions, either running partly or wholly concurrently with other elements in the same or other cycles, consist of the following, arranged in varying sequences: 1. Search, 2. Find, 3. Select, 4. Grasp, 5. Position, 6. Assemble, 7. Use, 8. Dissemble, or take apart, 9. Inspect, 10. Transport, loaded, 11. Pre-position for next operation, 12. Release load, 13. Transport, empty, 14. Wait (unavoidable delay), 15. Wait (avoidable delay), 16. Rest (for overcoming fatigue).&quot;

<text>Piye (also interpreted as Pankhy or Piankhi; d. 714 BC) was an ancient Kushite king and founder of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, who ruled Egypt from 744–714 BC. He ruled from the city of Napata, located deep in Nubia, modern-day Sudan.

==Name==
Piye adopted two throne names: Usimare and Sneferre. He was passionate about the worship of the god Amun, like many kings of Nubia. He revitalized the moribund Great Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal, which was first built under Thutmose III of the New Kingdom, employing numerous sculptors and stonemasons from Egypt. He was once thought to have also used the throne name &#x27;Menkheperre&#x27; (&quot;the Manifestation of Ra abides&quot;) but this prenomen has now been recognized as belonging to a local Theban king named Ini instead who was a contemporary of Piye.

==Family==

Piye was the son of Kashta and Pebatjma. He is known to have had three or four wives. Abar was the mother of his successor Taharqa. Further wives are Tabiry, Peksater and probably Khensa.

Piye is known to have had several children. He was the father of:
* King Shebitku. Said to be a son of Piye, or alternatively a brother of Piye.
* King Taharqa. Son of Queen Abar. He would take the throne after his uncle Shabaka and another male relative Shebitku.
* God&#x27;s Wife of Amun Shepenwepet II. Installed in Thebes during the reign of her brother Taharqa.
* Qalhata, wife of King Shabaka, she was the mother of king Tanutamun and probably of King Shabataka as well.
* Tabekenamun married her brother Taharqa.
* Naparaye married her brother Taharqa.
* Takahatenamun married her brother Taharqa.
* Arty, married king Shebitku.
* Har. Known from an offering table of his daughter Wadjrenes from Thebes (TT34).
* Khaliut, Governor of Kanad according to a stela found at Barkal.
* Princess Mutirdis, Chief Prophet of Hathor and Mut in Thebes and daughter of Piye according to Morkot. Thought to be a daughter of a local ruler named Menkheperre Khmuny from Hermopolis by Kitchen.

==Conquest of Egypt==
As ruler of Nubia and Upper Egypt, Piye took advantage of the squabbling of Egypt&#x27;s rulers by expanding Nubia&#x27;s power beyond Thebes into Lower Egypt. In reaction to this, Tefnakht of Sais formed a coalition between the local kings of the Delta Region and enticed Piye&#x27;s nominal ally—king Nimlot of Hermopolis—to defect to his side. Tefnakht then sent his coalition army south and besieged Herakleopolis where its king Peftjauawybast and the local Nubian commanders appealed to Piye for help. Piye reacted quickly to this crisis in his regnal year 20 by assembling an army to invade Middle and Lower Egypt and visited Thebes in time for the great Opet Festival which proves he effectively controlled Upper Egypt by this time. His military feats are chronicled in the Victory stela at Gebel Barkal:

Piye viewed his campaign as a holy war, commanding his soldiers to cleanse themselves ritually before beginning battle. He himself offered sacrifices to the great god Amun.

Piye then marched north and achieved complete victory at Herakleopolis, conquering the cities of Hermopolis and Memphis among others, and received the submission of the kings of the Nile Delta including Iuput II of Leontopolis, Osorkon IV of Tanis and his former ally Nimlot at Hermopolis. Hermopolis fell to the Nubian king after a siege lasting five months. Tefnakht took refuge in an island in the Delta and formally conceded defeat in a letter to the Nubian king but refused to personally pay homage to the Kushite ruler. Satisfied with his triumph, Piye proceeded to sail south to Thebes and returned to his homeland in Nubia never to return to Egypt.

Despite Piye&#x27;s successful campaign into the Delta, his authority only extended northward from Thebes up to the western desert oases and Herakleopolis where Peftjauawybast ruled as a Nubian vassal king. The local kings of Lower Egypt—especially Tefnakht—were essentially free to do what they wanted without Piye&#x27;s oversight. It was Shebitku, Piye&#x27;s successor, who later rectified this unsatisfactory situation by attacking Sais and defeating Tefnakht&#x27;s successor Bakenranef there, in his second regnal year.

==Length of reign ==

Piye&#x27;s highest known date was long thought to be the &quot;Year 24 III Akhet day 10&quot; date mentioned in the &quot;Smaller Dakhla Stela&quot; (Ashmolean Museum No.1894) from the Sutekh temple of Mut el-Kharab in the Dakhla Oasis. However, reliefs from the Great Temple at Gebel Barkal depict Piye celebrating a Heb Sed Festival. Such festivals were traditionally celebrated in a king&#x27;s 30th Year. It is debated whether the reliefs portrayed historical events, or were prepared in advance for the festival—in which case Piye might have died before his 30th regnal year. Piye is also attested by two papyri dated to Year 21 and 22 of his reign where he is named Pharaoh &quot;Piye Si-Ese Meryamun&quot; which is undoubtedly this king&#x27;s name. 

Kenneth Kitchen has suggested a reign of 31 years for Piye, based on the Year 8 donation stela of a king Shepsesre Tefnakht who is commonly viewed as Piye&#x27;s opponent. A dissenting opinion came from Olivier Perdu in 2002, who believes that this stela refers instead to the later king Tefnakht II because of stylistic similarities to another, dated to Year 2 of Necho I&#x27;s reign. Secondly, Kitchen observes that:
==Burial==

Piye&#x27;s tomb was located next to the largest Pyramid in the cemetery, designated Ku.1 (seen in the image on the right), at el-Kurru near Jebel Barkal in what is now Northern Sudan. Down a stairway of 19 steps opened to the east, the burial chamber is cut into the bedrock as an open trench and covered with a corbelled masonry roof. His body had been placed on a bed which rested in the middle of the chamber on a stone bench with its four corners cut away to receive the legs of the bed so that the bed platform lay directly on the bench. Further out to the edge of the cemetery (the first pharaoh to receive such an entombment in more than 500 years) his four favorite horses had been buried. This site would be also occupied by the tombs of several later members of the dynasty.

<text>Ixtaczoquitlán is a city in the Mexican state of Veracruz near the city of Orizaba.

== Geography ==
It is located 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) from Orizaba. It is close to the Fortín–Orizaba railroad and stands on Federal Highways 180 &amp; 190. It serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It is in the Orizaba-Córdoba region and is contiguous with these two as well as with the municipality of Fortín.

=== Climate ===
Ixtaczoquitlán has a temperate climate with temperatures between 10 °C and 32 °C (50F and 90F). The rainy season is June through September typically raining in the evenings and at night, with clear beautiful mornings and afternoons. The hottest months are April–July with warm to hot days but yet cool temps at night. The coolest months are Dec and Jan with frequent, beautiful fog at night which creates a dripping sound known here as &quot;chipi-chipi&quot; The vast majority of homes do not have heat or cooling as the climate is mild. It never freezes in Ixtac.

=== Fauna ===
The following fauna has been spotted in Ixtac: scarlet kingsnake, Black Racer, small lizards like the knob, Tarantulas, Geckos, Coatimundi, and Raccoons. Here is a short list of birds sighted here by KT:

== History ==
The Battle of Escamela was fought in Ixtaczoquitlán during the War of Mexican Independence in 1812. Mexican rebels under Jose Maria Morelos fought against Spanish loyalist forces as part of a broader plan to take control of Orizaba and cut off communications between Mexico City and the major port of Veracruz.

== Things to see and do ==
&quot;Venustiano Carranza Park&quot;: This is the main park in Ixtac centro. It was modernized in 2015–2016 with a lighted-fountain, image-reflection mirror, sound system, playground, performing arts stage, benches, landscaping (including jacarandas, Macadamia Trees, orchid trees, magnolias, sweet gums, sycamores, palms, flowering plants and grasses), food vending businesses (grab a beer or coffee and something to eat at or one of the vendors).[&quot;&quot;]

There is a trail that is now being modernized with stone steps and support walls which leads down the canyon to the river and to a natural spring called Los Sifones. There is swimming in the spring all year . It is warmer than nearby Ojo de agua. Update: this trail with approx. 560 stairs is now complete. Also finished is the new Glass overlook (Mirador) with access located at the south end of calle 9 Sur. 

Once down the mountain to the river, you can also go up the road to a small town called Zoquitlan viejo and walk around.

Walk around town and find a Taco de Flor Or mamela de frijol, which are unique in this part of Mexico and delicious.

== Legend ==
Legend has it that in the center of Ixtaczoquitlan have been nahuales wizards, who in the epoch of the Spaniards, could turn themselves into animals and shades, leaving everyone afraid. Nobody wanted to be outside during nights because of the nahuales, and the people hid the children for fear that the Nahuales could eat them.[&quot;&quot;]

Legend also has it there are two Gringos that live in town.

<doc id="410907" wikidata="Q2045297" url="?curid=410907" title="Pabst Blue Ribbon">
<text>Pabst Blue Ribbon, commonly abbreviated PBR, is an American lager beer sold by Pabst Brewing Company, established in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1844 and currently based in San Antonio, Texas. Originally called Best Select, and then Pabst Select, the current name comes from the blue ribbons tied around the bottle&#x27;s neck between 1882 and 1916.

==History==

Gottlieb and Frederika Pabst and their twelve-year-old son Frederick arrived in the United States in 1848 and settled in Chicago where Frederick eventually found work on the ships of Lake Michigan. In 1862, Frederick married Maria Best, daughter of Philip Best, whose father Jacob Best founded the Best Brewing Company, and in 1863 Frederick became a brewer at his father-in-law&#x27;s brewery.

When Philip Best retired to Germany in 1867, Pabst and Emil Schandein – his sister-in-law&#x27;s husband and the vice-president of Best Brewery – worked to transform the company into one of the nation&#x27;s largest brewers, capitalizing on, among other things, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 that destroyed nineteen Chicago breweries and helped position Milwaukee as the leading beer-producing city in the United States. In 1889, Schandein died, leaving Pabst as president and Schandein&#x27;s widow, Lisette Schandein, as vice-president. In 1890, Pabst changed the &quot;Best&quot; letterhead to &quot;Pabst&quot; and the Pabst Brewing Company officially began.

=== Brand name ===
The company has historically claimed that its flagship beer was renamed Pabst Blue Ribbon following its win as &quot;America&#x27;s Best&quot; at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Whether the brand actually won an award in 1893 is unclear. Some contemporaneous accounts indicate that many vendors were frustrated by the fair&#x27;s refusal to award such prizes. One account says that the only prizes awarded by the executive committee were bronze medals, in recognition of &quot;some independent and essential excellence in the article displayed&quot;, rather than &quot;merely to indicate the relative merits of competing exhibits&quot;. However, the beer had won many other awards at many other fairs – so many, in fact, that Captain Pabst had already started tying silk ribbons around every bottle. It was a time when beer bottles were more likely to be embossed than labeled. The ribbons were likely added at great cost to Pabst, but Pabst&#x27;s display of pride was also a display of marketing savvy. Patrons started asking their bartenders for &quot;the blue-ribbon beer.&quot;

=== Peak, decline, and revival ===
Sales of Pabst peaked at in 1977. In 1980 it was still third in sales in the U.S. Between 1980 and 1981 the company had four different CEOs, and by 1982 it slipped to fifth.

In 1996, Pabst headquarters left Milwaukee, and the company ended beer production at its main complex there. By 2001, the brand&#x27;s sales were below . That year, the company got a new CEO, Brian Kovalchuk, formerly the CFO of Benetton, and major changes at the company&#x27;s marketing department were made.

In 2010, food industry executive C. Dean Metropoulos bought the company for a reported $250 million. In 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission forced two advertising executives to cease efforts to raise $300 million to buy the Pabst Brewing Company. The two had raised over $200 million by crowdsourcing, collecting pledges via their website, Facebook, and Twitter. In November 2014, Eugene Kashper, an American beer entrepreneur, and TSG Consumer Partners acquired Pabst Brewing Company. In 2015, Pabst won the &quot;best large brewing company of the year&quot; award at the Great American Beer Festival.

Pabst Blue Ribbon is now available in several international markets, including Australia (where it is brewed locally), Canada, Ukraine, Russia, Dominican Republic, Brazil and China.

On October 8, 2020, the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation announced that Pabst was moving its headquarters from Los Angeles to San Antonio, Texas.

After a brief return, in 2020, Pabst announced it was again leaving Milwaukee, the city where it was founded, with the closing of the Captain Pabst Pilot House, a taproom and microbrewery which the company had opened in 2017 as part of a redevelopment of its historic brewery in the city. The city&#x27;s name continues to be a prominent part of its branding, despite it having no direct presence in or current impact on the area.

==Marketing==

In the mid-1940s, the brand was the titular sponsor of the radio comedy show &quot;Blue Ribbon Town&quot;, starring Groucho Marx. Between 1946 and 1949, Pabst sponsored &quot;The Eddie Cantor Pabst Blue Ribbon Show&quot;. It later was a sponsor of the radio mystery show &quot;Night Beat&quot; in the early 1950s.

The beer experienced a sales revival in the early 2000s after a two-decade-long slump, largely due to its increasing popularity among urban hipsters. Although the Pabst website features user-submitted photography, much of which features twenty-something Pabst drinkers dressed in alternative fashions, the company has opted not to fully embrace the countercultural label in its marketing, fearing that doing so could jeopardize the very &quot;authenticity&quot; that made the brand popular (as was the case with the poorly received OK Soda). Pabst instead targets its desired market niche through the sponsorship of indie music, local businesses, post-collegiate sports teams, dive bars and radio programming like National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. The company encourages the online submission of fan art, which is subsequently shown on the beer&#x27;s official Facebook page.

Beginning in 2021, Pabst began supporting professional wrestling (in particular the independent circuit) after becoming a sponsor for Matt Cardona&#x27;s podcast. It eventually led to the beer&#x27;s first major television commercial in decades during the August 4, 2021, broadcast of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, after it volunteered to step in to replace Domino&#x27;s Pizza as a sponsor of All Elite Wrestling following backlash from Domino&#x27;s when Nick Gage used a pizza cutter on Chris Jericho in a deathmatch on the previous week&#x27;s &quot;Dynamite&quot;, with said spot immediately airing before a Domino&#x27;s commercial.

In January 2022, the brand&#x27;s Twitter account tweeted a number of questionable messages such as &quot;Not drinking this January? Try eating ass!&quot;, a reference to Dry January. &quot;Nothing pairs like PBR and Amyl Nitrate, ask Frank Booth!&quot; and &quot;Blue Ribbon Butseks for All!&quot; The tweets and a number of follow-up replies were eventually deleted and the company released a statement apologizing for the incident. The brand manager who wrote the tweets was fired.

== Products ==
Pabst Blue Ribbon Original is the brand flagship and is brewed at 4.7% alcohol by volume. There is also Pabst Blue Ribbon Extra, which is described as a 6.5% ABV full-bodied lager. Pabst Blue Ribbon Easy is the brand&#x27;s light-style lager with lower calories and an ABV of 3.8%. The company also offers Pabst Blue Ribbon Non-Alc, a non-alcoholic beer brewed at less than 0.5% ABV.

==In popular culture==
In 1973, American country music artist Johnny Russell recorded, &quot;Rednecks, White Socks, and Blue Ribbon Beer,&quot; a song written by Bob McDill and Wayland Holyfield.

In the 1980 Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull, during a fight, Pabst Blue Ribbon has an advertisement that says &quot;And the next time that friendly bartender says, &quot;What&#x27;ll you have?&quot; Give him that answer the whole world gives, &#x27;Pabst Blue Ribbon.&#x27;&quot;

In the 1986 David Lynch film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, the character Frank Booth asks main character Jeffrey Beaumont for his favorite beer. Beaumont answers by saying Heineken, to which Booth gets infuriated; shouting &quot;Pabst Blue Ribbon&quot; at him.

In 1987, the Untamed Youth, a popular garage rock band from Columbia, Missouri recorded &quot;Pabst Blue Ribbon&quot;, a surf instrumental written by the band&#x27;s guitarist, Deke Dickerson. When this song was performed live, members of the band would spray the crowd with PBR cans. 

In &quot;The Accountant&quot;, 2001 Short Film (2002 Oscar Winner), the Accountant shows a marked preference for PBR - he is willing to drink green bottled beer, but when he sends out for beer it is PBR he asks for.
In the &quot;Route of All Evil&quot; episode of Futurama, a parody called Pabst Blue Robot is mentioned by Bender as his favorite beer.

Pabst Blue Ribbon is sometimes featured (in a negative context) in the TV show &quot;South Park&quot;.

In Marvel Comics &quot;Savage Avengers&quot;, there are a number of in jokes attributed to Wolverine, who describes himself to Conan the Barbarian as &quot;Logan ... of Pabst&quot;. Conan, being a time displaced warrior, takes Logan (and his love of Pabst beer) literally and refers to Wolverine and Pabst in the same context. For example, in issue #2 of &quot;Savage Avengers&quot; Wolverine faints from blood loss as the heroes face off against a large group of enemies. Trying to awaken and inspire his friend, Conan picks up Wolverine and shakes him, yelling for the mutant super hero to wake up, &quot;..for Pabst!&quot;, presumably to upkeep the honour of Pabst.

In the lyrics of the Zack Brown song &quot;Toes&quot;, PBR is mentioned in the last verse:

&quot;[I&#x27;ll] put my ass in a lawn chair, and toes in the clay – Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way – Life is good today.&quot;

In the lyrics of the Lana Del Rey song &quot;This Is What Makes Us Girls&quot; from her first studio album &quot;Born to Die&quot;, PBR is mentioned on the first strophe of the song:

&quot;Drinkin&#x27; in the small town firelight (Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)&quot;

In May 2016, WWE released a John Cena T-shirt that bears resemblance to and inspired by the Pabst Blue Ribbon can design. The Pabst Brewing Company threatened to sue Cena and the WWE for trademark infringement which drew criticism by wrestling fans and fellow personnel as a publicity stunt. While respecting intellectual property and deny any wrongdoing due to the fair use of its clothing design, WWE pulled the T-shirt from its WWE Shop website and released a modified design to the Cena “Pabst” T-shirt. However, the original “Pabst” T-shirt design was back on sale on WWE Shop a month later.

Pennsylvania-based Horrorpunk/Metal band Seglock&#x27;s 2024 EP &quot;Not For Human Consumption&quot; features a stylized version of the Pabst Blue Ribbon logo as its album cover.

<doc id="410910" wikidata="Q5509718" url="?curid=410910" title="Furry Dance">
<text>The Furry Dance ( ) is a celebration of the passing of winter and the arrival of spring, and one of the oldest British customs still practised today. Traditionally held on 8 May, it is held in Helston, Cornwall, where dancers wear lily of the valley, the town&#x27;s symbolic flower. The name likely derives from Cornish &quot;fer&quot; meaning &quot;fair, feast&quot; referencing the celebration of the Apparition of Michael the Archangel, Helston&#x27;s patron saint. 

==Origin==
The most famous Furry Dance takes place in Helston, Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is one of the oldest British customs still practised today. The earliest mention seems to be in a letter to the Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine for 1790 where the writer says &quot;At Helstone, a genteel and populus borough town in Cornwall, it is customary to dedicate the 8th May to revelry (festive mirth, not loose jollity). It is called Furry Day&quot;. The dance is very well attended every year and people travel from all over the world to see it: Helston Town Band play all the music for the dances.

The Furry Dance takes place every year on 8 May (except when the date falls on a Sunday or Monday — Monday being Market Day — when it is the preceding Saturday). In Helston, 8 May, the Apparition of Saint Michael, the Archangel Michael of Christianity, is called Flora Day, and the term &quot;furry&quot; probably derives from the Cornish language: fer, &quot;fair, feast&quot;. It is a celebration of the passing of winter and the arrival of spring. The schedule of the day is thus: morning dance at 7 a.m., the first performance of the &quot;Hal-an-Tow&quot; pageant at 8:30 a.m. with the last completed by 9:30 a.m., children&#x27;s dance traditionally at 10 a.m. though in recent years the numbers and logistics have seen this advanced to 9.50 a.m. and in 2016 to 9.40 a.m., midday dance at noon, and evening dance at 5 p.m.. Of these, the midday dance is perhaps the best known: it was traditionally the dance of the gentry in the town, and today the men wear top hats and tails while the women dance in their finest frocks.

Traditionally, the dancers wear lily of the valley, which is Helston&#x27;s symbolic flower. The gentlemen wear it on the left, with the flowers pointing upwards, and the ladies wear it upside down on the right. Lily of the valley is worn on Flora Day by dancers, bandsmen, Flora Day stewards and by those who are &quot;Helston-born&quot;.

==Children&#x27;s dance==
The children&#x27;s dance involves over 1,000 children aged from 7 to 18, all dressed in white, the boys with lily of the valley buttonholes and the girls wearing flowers in their hair, the flower determined by the school they attend. They come from St Michael&#x27;s School, Nansloe School, Parc Eglos School, and Helston Community College: each year a different school leads the dance.

All the boys wear white clothing, with the only colour being their school ties, and the girls (also in white) wear matching coloured head-dress flowers (blue cornflowers for St Michael&#x27;s, forget-me-nots for Helston Community College, daisies for Nansloe and poppies and buttercups for Parc Eglos) in their hair.

The girls wear white dresses following the school rules and boys white shirt and trousers or shorts. They all dance around Helston town, with the band playing the accompanying music.

==Pageant==

The Hal-an-Tow, which takes place on the same day, is a kind of mystery play with various historical and mythical themes. The Hal-an-Tow Pageant starts at St John&#x27;s Bridge and is performed at seven locations around the town. Characters include Friar Tuck, Robin Hood, Saint George, and Saint Michael. The Hal-an-Tow song welcomes the coming of summer. It contains disparaging references to the Spaniards, probably referring to the Spanish raid on Newlyn in 1595. The &quot;Helston Furry Dance&quot; is number 135 in Roy Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Book of English Country Songs.&quot;

The meaning of Hal-an-Tow is unclear. The word &quot;kalan&quot; means the first of the month in Cornish, but the first letter mutates to an &quot;h&quot; in some circumstances. It has been suggested that &quot;tow&quot; means garland in Cornish. This is not correct, though &quot;tosow&quot; means tufts, tassles, or bunches. Some have suggested that Hal-an-Tow means &quot;raise the roof&quot;. In Helston tow is pronounced to rhyme with cow and not toe. The Cornish word &quot;tew&quot; means fat, and a recent explanation of the name is that Hal-an-Tow means the eve of the fattening time. The version of the Hal-an-Tow sung by The Watersons and other folk groups has never been sung in Helston. The Helston song does not include the verse about cuckolds and horns. These words appear to have been added from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot; by Mike Waterson, and this version must be later than 1954. The original song was recorded in Sabine Baring-Gould&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the West&quot; (which contains errors) and the versions in &quot;Canow Kernow&quot; edited by Inglis Gundry, such as the one recorded by William Sandys in 1846. The words of the Hal-an-Tow as it is currently sung in Helston are:
&lt;poem&gt;
Chorus:
Hal-an-tow, jolly rumble, O.
For we are up as soon as any day, O
And for to fetch the Summer home,
The Summer and the May, O
For Summer is a-come, O,
And Winter is a-gone, O.

Robin Hood and Little John,
They both are gone to fair, O
And we will to the merry green wood
To see what they do there, O
And for to chase, O
To chase the buck and doe.

Chorus

Where are those Spaniards
That make so great a boast, O?
For they shall eat the grey goose feather
And we will eat the roast, O
In every land, O
The land where-e&#x27;er we go.

Chorus

St Piran showed his care for us
And all our sons and daughters, O
He brought the book of Christendom
Across the western waters, O
And taught the love of Heaven above
For Cornishmen below.

Chorus

As for that good knight, St George
St George he was a knight, O
Of all the knights in Christendom
St George he is the right, O
In every land, O
The land where-e&#x27;er we go.

Chorus

But to a greater than St George
Our Helston has a right, O
St Michael with his wings outspread,
The archangel so bright, O
Who fought the fiend, O
Of all mankind the foe.

Chorus

God bless Aunt Mary Moses
And all her power and might, O
And send us peace in merry England
Both day and night, O.
And send us peace in merry England
Both now and ever more, O.

Chorus
&lt;/poem&gt;
The verse about Saint Michael was added in the 1930s by Robert Morton Nance. The Saint Piran verse was added in 2005. The Aunt Mary Moses verse is only performed at the first location, at St John&#x27;s Bridge, and the last location, by Helston Guildhall.

==Music==
The music is provided by Helston Town Band, augmented by members of other local bands. They play from memory, as it is suggested that the music for the dance has never been written down. However it was at various times, such as by Davies Gilbert in 1823. In 1890 Cornish antiquarian Margaret Ann Courtney wrote that the tune was sometimes known as &quot;John the Bone&quot;. the following rhyme often being attached to the tune by local children,
The BBC recorded the band playing for the dance on 8 May 1943 and this recording is included in &quot;The Voice of the People vol. 16: You lazy lot of bone-shakers&quot;, issued by Topic Records in 1998.

=== &quot;The Floral Dance&quot; ===
In 1911 Katie Moss, a London composer visiting Helston, observed the Furry Dance and joined in the dancing herself in the evening. On the train home she wrote words and music of a song about her experience, calling the song &quot;The Floral Dance&quot;. She quotes the Furry Dance tune in the piano accompaniment to the chorus – though altering the melody in two bars.

This song was soon published by Chappell &amp; Co., and first performed by baritone Thorpe Bates the same year. The first recording was made by Peter Dawson on the Zonophone label in 1912. It has since been recorded by many other artists. A bass baritone version of the song was recorded by Inia Te Wiata and was released posthumously in a collection called &quot;Just call me Happy&quot;.

In 1976 the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band recorded an arrangement of the Moss song made by their musical director Derek Broadbent. By Christmas 1977 half a million copies of the record had been sold, and it was only kept from the top position in the Christmas charts by Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;. In January 1978 a vocal version by Terry Wogan accompanied by the Hanwell Band reached number 21 on the UK singles chart. Wogan did not include the last verse (the climax of the story) in this recording.

== Similar customs ==
Similar customs can be found in, amongst other places, Biewer, a district of Trier, Germany, where the annual &quot;&quot; takes place and in Echternach, Luxembourg. There are also similarities with the &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss festival in Padstow, Cornwall, and with similar events in Minehead, Somerset, and Combe Martin in Devon. A Flora Dance takes place through the narrow streets of Fowey, Cornwall during its annual Regatta Week in the third week of August and through Perranporth by local school children until as recently as the early 1990’s.

<doc id="410913" wikidata="Q261781" url="?curid=410913" title="Luigi Denza">
<text>Luigi Denza (24 February 1846 – 27 January 1922) was an Italian composer.

==Career==
Denza was born at Castellammare di Stabia, near Naples. He studied music with Saverio Mercadante and Paolo Serrao at the Naples Conservatory. In 1884, he moved to London, taught singing privately and became a professor of singing at the Royal Academy of Music in 1898, where he taught for two decades. He died in London in 1922.

==&quot;Funiculì, Funiculà&quot;==
Denza is best remembered for &quot;Funiculì, Funiculà&quot; (1880), a humorous Neapolitan song inspired by the inauguration of a funicular to the summit of Vesuvius. Neapolitan journalist Peppino Turco contributed the lyrics and may have prompted the song by suggesting that Denza compose something for the Piedigrotta song-writing competition. &quot;Funiculì, Funiculà&quot; was published the same year by Ricordi and within a year had sold a million copies.

==Other music==
In addition to &quot;Funiculì, Funiculà&quot;, Denza composed hundreds of popular songs. Some of them, such as &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;, have been sung by Enrico Caruso, Mario Lanza, Carlo Bergonzi, Luciano Pavarotti, and Ronan Tynan. He was also an able mandolinist and guitarist, and for those instruments he wrote &quot;Ricordo di Quisisana&quot;, &quot;Come to me&quot;, &quot;Nocturne&quot;, and several others. Denza also wrote an opera, &quot;Wallenstein&quot; (1876).

==Judging of James Joyce==
Other than writing songs and music, Denza&#x27;s enduring legacy was his judging of James Joyce, who was a singer before he became a world-famous novelist.

When Denza was Professor of Music at the London Academy of Music, he was asked to judge the 1904 &quot;Feis Ceoil&quot; Irish Singing Contest, a prototype of today&#x27;s musical reality shows. On 16 May 1904, Denza attempted to mentor Joyce, and would have awarded him the Gold Medal, but Joyce could not sight read, missing a crucial part of the competition; Denza instead awarded Joyce the third-place Bronze medal. Disgusted, Joyce gave the medal to his Aunt Josephine; the medal ended up years later being bought by Michael Flatley at an auction.

<text>Toni Cade Bambara, born Miltona Mirkin Cade (March 25, 1939 – December 9, 1995), was an African-American author, documentary film-maker, social activist and college professor.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Miltona Mirkin Cade was born in Harlem, New York, to parents Walter and Helen (Henderson) Cade. She grew up in Harlem, Bedford Stuyvesant (Brooklyn), Queens, and New Jersey. At the age of six, she changed her name from Miltona to Toni, and then in 1970, changed her name to include the name of a West African ethnic group, Bambara, after finding the name written as part of a signature on a sketchbook discovered in a trunk among her great-grandmother&#x27;s other belongings. 

With her new name, she felt it represented &quot;the accumulation of experiences&quot;, in which she had finally discovered her purpose in the world. In 1970, Bambara had a daughter, Karma Bene Bambara Smith, with her partner Gene Lewis, an actor and a family friend.

Bambara attended Queens College in 1954, where almost the entire undergraduate student population was white. At first, she planned to become a doctor, but her passion for arts directed her to become an English major. As Bambara had a passion for jazz and different forms of art in general, she became a member of the Dance Club of Queens College. She also took part in theater, where she was designated as stage manager and costume designer. Bambara was among those who participated in folk singing when it first emerged in the 1950s, when the songs had a political message inscribed in them. She graduated from Queens College with a B.A. in Theater Arts/English Literature in 1959.

=== Work and study ===
Later on, she went to study mime at the Ecole de Mime Etienne Decroux in Paris, France. She became interested in dance before completing her master&#x27;s degree at City College, New York, in 1964, while serving as program director of Colony Settlement House in Brooklyn. She also worked for New York social services and as a recreation director in the psychiatric ward of Metropolitan Hospital. 

From 1965 to 1969, she was with City College&#x27;s &quot;Search for Education, Elevation, Knowledge&quot; (SEEK) program and helped with its development. 

She taught English, published material and worked with SEEK&#x27;s black theatre group. Bambara was also an English instructor for the New Careers Program of Newark, New Jersey, in 1969. She was made assistant professor of English at Rutgers University&#x27;s new Livingston College in 1969 and continued until 1974. She was visiting professor in Afro-American Studies at Emory University and at Atlanta University (1977), where she also taught at the School of Social Work (until 1979). Bambara was production-artist-in-residence at Neighborhood Arts Center (1975–79), at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri (1976), and at Atlanta&#x27;s Spelman College (1978–79). From 1986, she taught film-script writing at Louis Massiah&#x27;s Scribe Video Center in Philadelphia. Bambara also held lectures at the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution, where she conducted literary readings.

Bambara was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993 and two years later died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

== Activism ==
Bambara worked within black communities to create consciousness around ideas such as feminism and black awareness. As Bambara had become part of the faculty of City College, she strived to make it more inclusive. To do this, she wanted to add more classes, such as a nutrition course, to teach students more about their culture. Bambara also wanted to see a creation of an academy that generated an environment in which students could become more involved in learning more about political and social problems in the community as well as their culture.

Bambara participated in several community and activist organizations, and her work was influenced by the Civil Rights and Black Nationalist movements of the 1960s. In the early to mid-1970s, she traveled to Cuba along with Robert Cole, Hattie Gossett, Barbara Webb, and Suzanne Ross to study how women&#x27;s political organizations operated there. She put these experiences into practice in the late 1970s after moving with her daughter Karma Bene to Atlanta, Georgia, where Bambara co-founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers.

== Literary career ==
Bambara was active in the 1960s Black Arts Movement and the emergence of black feminism. In her writings, she was inspired by New York&#x27;s streets and its culture, where the culture influenced her due to her experience of the teachings of &quot;Garveyites, Muslims, Pan-Africanists and Communists against the backdrop and the culture of jazz music&quot;. Her anthology &quot;The Black Woman&quot; (1970), including poetry, short stories, and essays by Nikki Giovanni, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Paule Marshall and herself, as well as work by Bambara&#x27;s students from the SEEK program, was the first feminist collection to focus on African-American women. &quot;Tales and Stories for Black Folk&quot; (1971) contained work by Langston Hughes, Ernest J. Gaines, Pearl Crayton, Alice Walker and students. 
She wrote the introduction for another groundbreaking feminist anthology by women of color, &quot;This Bridge Called My Back&quot; (1981), edited by Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga. While Bambara is often described as a &quot;feminist&quot;, in her chapter entitled &quot;On the Issue of Roles&quot;, she writes: &quot;Perhaps we need to let go of all notions of manhood and femininity and concentrate on Blackhood.&quot;

Bambara&#x27;s 1972 book, &quot;Gorilla, My Love&quot;, collected 15 of her short stories, written between 1960 and 1970. Most of these stories are told from a first-person point of view and are &quot;written in rhythmic urban black English.&quot; The narrator is often a sassy young girl who is tough, brave, and caring and who &quot;challenge[s] the role of the female black victim&quot;. Bambara called her writing &quot;upbeat&quot; fiction. Among the stories included were &quot;Blues Ain&#x27;t No Mockin Bird&quot; as well as &quot;Raymond&#x27;s Run&quot; and &quot;The Lesson&quot;. This collection of short stories mirrored the behavior of Bambara, in which was described as &quot;dramatic, often flamboyant, with a penchant for authentic emotion&quot;.

Her novel &quot;The Salt Eaters&quot; (1980) centers on a healing event that coincides with a community festival in a fictional city of Claybourne, Georgia. In the novel, minor characters use a blend of modern medical techniques alongside traditional folk medicines and remedies to help the central character, Velma, heal after a suicide attempt. Through the struggle of Velma and the other characters surrounding her, Bambara chronicles the deep psychological toll that African-American political and community organizers can suffer, especially women. Bambara continues to investigate ideas of illness and wellness in the black community with a call to action through her characters. &quot;Velma (and by extension black women) must re-affirm healthy relationships with one another that create and sustain pathways towards wholeness and reprioritize black women&#x27;s health in the larger domain of social justice movements.&quot; While &quot;The Salt Eaters&quot; was her first novel, she won the American Book Award. In 1981, she also won the Langston Hughes Society Award.

After the publication and success of &quot;The Salt Eaters&quot;, she focused on film and television production throughout the 1980s. From 1980 to 1988, she produced at least one film per year. Bambara wrote the script for Louis Massiah&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;The Bombing of Osage Avenue&quot;, which dealt with the massive police assault on the Philadelphia headquarters of the black liberation group MOVE on May 13, 1985. The film was a success, viewed at film festivals and airing on national public broadcasting channels.

Bambara&#x27;s novel &quot;Those Bones Are Not My Child&quot; (whose manuscript she titled &quot;If Blessings Come&quot;) was published posthumously in 1999. It deals with the disappearance and murder of 40 black children in Atlanta between 1979 and 1981. It was called her masterpiece by Toni Morrison, who edited it and also gathered some of Bambara&#x27;s short stories, essays, and interviews in the volume &quot;Deep Sightings &amp; Rescue Missions: Fiction, Essays &amp; Conversations&quot; (Vintage, 1996).

Bambara&#x27;s work was explicitly political, concerned with injustice and oppression in general and with the fate of African-American communities and grassroots political organizations in particular.

Female protagonists and narrators dominate her writing, which was informed by radical feminism and firmly placed inside African-American culture, with its dialect, oral traditions and jazz techniques. Like other members of the Black Arts Movement, Bambara was heavily influenced by &quot;Garveyites, Muslims, Pan-Africanists, and Communists&quot; in addition to modern jazz artists such as Sun Ra and John Coltrane, whose music served not only as inspiration but provided a structural and aesthetic model for written forms as well. This is evident in her work through her development of non-linear &quot;situations that build like improvisations to a melody&quot; to focus on character and building a sense of place and atmosphere. Bambara also credited her strong-willed mother, Helen Bent Henderson Cade Brehon, who urged her and her brother Walter Cade (an established painter) to be proud of African-American culture and history.

Bambara contributed to PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Experience&quot; documentary series with &quot;Midnight Ramble: Oscar Micheaux and the Story of Race Movies&quot;. She also was one of four filmmakers who made the collaborative 1995 documentary &quot;W. E. B. Du Bois: A Biography in Four Voices&quot;.

<doc id="410917" wikidata="Q2448411" url="?curid=410917" title="Syngonium">
<text>Syngonium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical rainforests in southern Mexico, the West Indies, Central and South America. They are woody vines growing to heights of 10–20 m or more in trees. They have leaves that change shape according to the plant&#x27;s stage of growth, and adult leaf forms are often much more lobed than the juvenile forms usually seen on small house plants. The scientific name of the genus comes from the Greek words σύν (syn - plus, z) and γονή (gone - gonada) and refers to the fused ovaries of female flowers.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Syngonium&quot; species are often grown as house plants, usually only in the juvenile foliage stages. &quot;Syngonium podophyllum&quot; is the most commonly cultivated species, and is often referred to simply as &quot;Syngonium.&quot; For successful growth, a winter minimum temperature 16 °C to 18 °C (60 to 65°F) must be maintained, rising to during the growing season. They require high humidity, including misting the leaves regularly, and good light, but not direct sunlight; they will tolerate low light levels. Water freely from spring to autumn, sparingly in winter. Feed regularly in spring and summer. If juvenile foliage is preferred, cut off all the climbing stems that develop — the plant will remain bushy, rather than climb, and the leaves will be more arrow-shaped. Repot every second spring. Propagation is by cuttings or air layering.

==Distribution==
&quot;Syngonium&quot; species generally inhabit tropical rainforests, subtropical forests, ruderal areas, thickets, urban areas, and wetlands. Invasive species are also troublesome weeds, e.g. banana crops.

&quot;Syngonium&quot; species are native to tropical America, where they are found from Mexico to Brazil. The center of diversity of genus is in Costa Rica and Panama, where there are a total of 16 species (13 in Costa Rica and 11 in Panama). The second place for the diversity of species is Mexico, where 8 species are present. The most widespread species is &quot;S. podophyllum&quot;, which ranges from Mexico to Brazil. It is believed that the Mexican and Costa Rican populations of &quot;Syngonium&quot; have long been separated, which translates into morphological differences in the representatives of the same species (e.g. &quot;S. podophyllum&quot; and &quot;S. macrophyllum&quot;).

&quot;S. stopowowa&quot; was introduced as an ornamental groundcover in American Samoa, Australia, Micronesia, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Niue, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, Florida, Hawaii, the Bahamas, Easter Island, Rota, Solomon Islands, and on Christmas Island. In each of these locations, it is widespread, invasive and displaces native vegetation. Similarly, &quot;S. angustatum&quot; is an invasive species on many Pacific islands and the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.

==Morphology and anatomy==
It is an elongated, climbing or creeping herbaceous evergreen plant that reaches a height of with a sympodial growth type, lacking branches (branches off only after damage to the apical meristem), cylindrical to oval in cross-section. After the inflorescences have risen from the top of the stem, it stops growing, and from the side bud, placed two nodes below the top of the stem, a new main shoot is formed.

The stem reaches several millimeters in diameter in juvenile plants and up to 6 cm in diameter (average of 1–2 cm) in mature plants. In juvenile plants, the stem is green and performs photosynthesis, but with age the plant cells stem lose chlorophyll. The climbing stalks have elongated internodes and are elastic to some extent, however, after bending the stem&#x27;s skin often breaks and peels off, turning brown or yellowish. The stem in section shows a distinct layer of the plant directly under the skin of the stem. The border between the collenchyma and stem is poorly scratched. In the parenchyma, starch grains are randomly distributed. The tissue of the stem also contains idioblasts with calcium oxalate crystals and drusen. The stem also contains secretory cells, containing tannins and milk juice, which solidifies in the air.

Just below each node there are two types of adventitious roots: a bundle of sticky roots and a single root, whose function is to supply the plant with nutrients. Twisting foliage with divergence 2/25, sometimes disturbed by slight twisting of the stem. Leaf petioles always form a distinct, wide vagina, with a length reaching from the middle to almost the top of the tail. The top of the vagina often ends slowly, it is pointed to the rounded. The petiole of species belonging to the informal oblongatum section is widened and extends beyond the base of the plaque. There are many intercellular air chambers in the tissues of the petioles, which makes them soft and brittle. In cross-section, the petioles are rounded on the axial side and individually ribbed on the axial side. The tails of juvenile leaves are often grooved. The leaf blades of the twigs are diverse on juveniles, transient and mature, differing in the shape of the plaque. Plants often begin flowering before the emergence of mature leaves, which led to misleading description of new types of twigs.

Primitive pinnate pincers, converging to from 3 to 5 separate conductive beams. The marginal line located furthest from the edge of the plaque is the largest, formed by the lowest side veins. Further, smaller marginal lines are formed by higher, smaller primary veins or secondary veins. Often, the fourth and fifth marginal bundles are not visible to the naked eye. The use of the distal order creates retinal nerve.

===Leaves===
The shape of leaf blades is a feature dividing the genus into informal groups:
* Cordatum - juvenile leaves whole, ovate or elliptical; matured leaves, ovoid-elliptical, oblong-ovate or ovate, less often arrow-shaped and slightly narrowed,
* Oblongatum - juvenile and mature oblong leaves for longitudinal-elliptical or ovoid-elliptic,
* Pinnatilobum - youthful egg-shaped leaves, often with a heart-shaped root, mature split leaves, narrowly lobed,
* Syngonium - juvenile leaves, whole ovate or elliptical; mature bisector leaves up to 11-secant and fan-shaped; the degree of necrosis of mature leaves depends on the age of the leaf and its position on the stem, older leaves and higher on the stem are more complicated than juveniles and lower ones. Not fully mature leaves of plants that start climbing are arrow or spear.

===Flowers===
Mono-flowering plants, forming from 1 to 11 inflorescences, the type of flask. Inflorescences are always formed at the top of the main shoot. They accompany peduncles that are almost always raised and triangular or almost cylindrical in cross-section, with an open rib on one side. Peduncles are relatively short, but they prolong after fertilization of flowers and bend to the ground under the weight of ripening fruit.

During flowering the inflorescence stretches out, creating a more or less spherical &quot;cup&quot; on the back of the vagina. The inside of the vagina is generally white or creamy-white in the upper part, at the chamber level often with a red or violet color. For some species (e.g. S. neglectum) the vagina deflects backwards, revealing the butt completely. After fading, the sheath closes and the upper part dries up. The inflorescence flask, which is much shorter than the vagina, is divided into three sections: the lowest one, covered with greenish or light orange female flowers, reaching a length of 7 to 48 mm, a central aperture, sometimes broad, covered with staminaria and a peak fragment, widened, covered with white male flowers.

Each female flower consists of two (rarely three) fused carpel. Staphylococci are usually the size of fertile male flowers, but more irregular in shape. Male flowers consist of 4, almost sitting heads of rods, joined to a greater or lesser extent in the synandrium, with a truncated apex and rhomboid, pentagonal or hexagonal edges, rarely serrated. Anthers are connected with a thick connector, they open by a short gap below the connector.

===Fruits===
The fruit is an ovoid, multigire fruit compound, surrounded by a vaginal inflorescence chamber, which sometimes breaks and curls up, revealing fruit that is usually brownish and very aromatic (seeds shed by mammals) or white (in &quot;S. mauroanum&quot;, &quot;S. triphyllum&quot; and &quot;S. wendlandii&quot;, seeds spread by birds). Each fruit contains from 50 to 100 seeds, which are usually ovate or cylindrical, with dimensions 5-10 × 3–6 mm, with rounded ends. The seed husks are black or brown, thin, shiny. Seeds lose their ability to germinate after drying.

===Related genera===
Representatives of the genus philodendron, from which the twins differ mainly in the conjugated, 1-3-chamber ovaries (in the case of the genus philodendron, ovaries are free and multi-chambered) and seeds without endosperms. In the non-blossoming state, Syngonium can be distinguished from philodendrons on non- cattalyllable leaves and clearly visible submarginal monofilament located 3–10 mm from the edge of the leaf.

=== Propagation ===
Syngonium is easy to propagate and its propagation can be easily done in water or soil through cutting. Simply get a perfect or suitable cutting and plant it in water or soil and provide best care conditions.

==Biology and ecology ==
Perennial, evergreen climbers and hemieiphytes. Sometimes plants, e.g. after breaking the stem, become epiphytes. After germination of the seeds, which always takes place in the ground, the plant remains for some time at the stage of the rosette, with a slender stalk with very short internodes. Leaves, first ovate, after some time become cordate at the base. Then the stem rapidly grows to length, creeping in places with the highest shading. After reaching the trunk of the tree, the stem begins to climb rapidly towards the light, and the plant begins to form larger leaf blades. After reaching the appropriate height, the plants form mature leaf blades and bloom. After the growth cone is damaged, the usually unbranched plant begins to form lateral shoots. In the event of loss of contact with the support by the top part of the stem, the plant begins to produce narrower and longer internodes and smaller leaves. The flowers of the twins are protogous.

In the process of flowering plants use the mechanism of thermogenesis. Plants bloom for 3 days. Around noon on the first day of the cycle the scabbard inflorescence opens up to ½ to ⅔ of its length, allowing the insects to access the female flowers. The markings of the bars become moist and the temperature of the flask slightly rises above the ambient level. On the morning of the second day of the cycle, the temperature of the flask rapidly increases (to about 12 °C above the environment), and the flowers begin to give off a sharp aroma, attracting insects. This condition lasts for about 12 hours, after which the inflorescence temperature drops, but remains at about 2 °C above the external conditions. On the third day the temperature of the flask again increases slightly, and the sheath curls up on the stretch of staminodes and female flowers, which stop taking pollen at the same time. Then the male flowers open, letting out long threads of pollen, which falls into the chamber formed by the lower part of the vagina. At the same time, the temperature of the flask drops to the ambient level. Beetles are the primary insects that pollinate the flowers, especially those in the subfamilies Rutelinae and Dynastiniae. &quot;Syngonium podophyllum&quot; predominantly reproduces vegetatively, contributing to its invasiveness.

==Toxicity==
The twig tissues contain sharp crystals of calcium oxalate. Contact with the plant, especially its accidental damage, can cause inflammation of the skin, manifested by itching, burning, and the appearance of efflorescence and blisters. Getting the juice of the plant into the eye causes burning and tearing. Contact plants from the mucous membranes of the mouth causes them severe irritation, seen as a sharp, searing pain and swelling. Ingestion of the plant causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa.

<text>Neutron radiation is a form of ionizing radiation that presents as free neutrons. Typical phenomena are nuclear fission or nuclear fusion causing the release of free neutrons, which then react with nuclei of other atoms to form new nuclides—which, in turn, may trigger further neutron radiation. Free neutrons are unstable, decaying into a proton, an electron, plus an electron antineutrino. Free neutrons have a mean lifetime of 887 seconds (14 minutes, 47 seconds).

Neutron radiation is distinct from alpha, beta and gamma radiation.

== Sources ==

Neutrons may be emitted from nuclear fusion or nuclear fission, or from other nuclear reactions such as radioactive decay or particle interactions with cosmic rays or within particle accelerators. Large neutron sources are rare, and usually limited to large-sized devices such as nuclear reactors or particle accelerators, including the Spallation Neutron Source.

Neutron radiation was discovered from observing an alpha particle colliding with a beryllium nucleus, which was transformed into a carbon nucleus while emitting a neutron, Be(α, n)C. The combination of an alpha particle emitter and an isotope with a large (α, n) nuclear reaction probability is still a common neutron source.

=== Neutron radiation from fission ===
The neutrons in nuclear reactors are generally categorized as slow (thermal) neutrons or fast neutrons depending on their energy. Thermal neutrons are similar in energy distribution (the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution) to a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium; but are easily captured by atomic nuclei and are the primary means by which elements undergo nuclear transmutation.

To achieve an effective fission chain reaction, neutrons produced during fission must be captured by fissionable nuclei, which then split, releasing more neutrons. In most fission reactor designs, the nuclear fuel is not sufficiently refined to absorb enough fast neutrons to carry on the chain reaction, due to the lower cross section for higher-energy neutrons, so a neutron moderator must be introduced to slow the fast neutrons down to thermal velocities to permit sufficient absorption. Common neutron moderators include graphite, ordinary (light) water and heavy water. A few reactors (fast neutron reactors) and all nuclear weapons rely on fast neutrons.

=== Cosmogenic neutrons ===
Cosmogenic neutrons are produced from cosmic radiation in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere or surface, as well as in particle accelerators. They often possess higher energy levels compared to neutrons found in reactors. Many of these neutrons activate atomic nuclei before reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface, while a smaller fraction interact with nuclei in the atmospheric air. When these neutrons interact with nitrogen-14 atoms, they can transform them into carbon-14 (14C), which is extensively utilized in radiocarbon dating.

== Uses ==
&quot;Cold&quot;, &quot;thermal&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; neutron radiation is most commonly used in scattering and diffraction experiments, to assess the properties and the structure of materials in crystallography, condensed matter physics, biology, solid state chemistry, materials science, geology, mineralogy, and related sciences. Neutron radiation is also used in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy to treat cancerous tumors due to its highly penetrating and damaging nature to cellular structure. Neutrons can also be used for imaging of industrial parts termed neutron radiography when using film, neutron radioscopy when taking a digital image, such as through image plates, and neutron tomography for three-dimensional images. Neutron imaging is commonly used in the nuclear industry, the space and aerospace industry, as well as the high reliability explosives industry.

== Ionization mechanisms and properties ==
Neutron radiation is often called &quot;indirectly ionizing radiation&quot;. It does not ionize atoms in the same way that charged particles such as protons and electrons do (exciting an electron), because neutrons have no charge. However, neutron interactions are largely ionizing, for example when neutron absorption results in gamma emission and the gamma ray (photon) subsequently removes an electron from an atom, or a nucleus recoiling from a neutron interaction is ionized and causes more traditional subsequent ionization in other atoms. Because neutrons are uncharged, they are more penetrating than alpha radiation or beta radiation. In some cases they are more penetrating than gamma radiation, which is impeded in materials of high atomic number. In materials of low atomic number such as hydrogen, a low energy gamma ray may be more penetrating than a high energy neutron.

== Health hazards and protection ==
In health physics, neutron radiation is a type of radiation hazard. Another, more severe hazard of neutron radiation, is neutron activation, the ability of neutron radiation to induce radioactivity in most substances it encounters, including bodily tissues. This occurs through the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei, which are transformed to another nuclide, frequently a radionuclide. This process accounts for much of the radioactive material released by the detonation of a nuclear weapon. It is also a problem in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion installations as it gradually renders the equipment radioactive such that eventually it must be replaced and disposed of as low-level radioactive waste.

Neutron radiation protection relies on radiation shielding. Due to the high kinetic energy of neutrons, this radiation is considered the most severe and dangerous radiation to the whole body when it is exposed to external radiation sources. In comparison to conventional ionizing radiation based on photons or charged particles, neutrons are repeatedly bounced and slowed (absorbed) by light nuclei so hydrogen-rich material is more effective at shielding than iron nuclei. The light atoms serve to slow down the neutrons by elastic scattering so they can then be absorbed by nuclear reactions. However, gamma radiation is often produced in such reactions, so additional shielding must be provided to absorb it. Care must be taken to avoid using materials whose nuclei undergo fission or neutron capture that causes radioactive decay of nuclei, producing gamma rays.

Neutrons readily pass through most material, and hence the absorbed dose (measured in grays) from a given amount of radiation is low, but interact enough to cause biological damage. The most effective shielding materials are water, or hydrocarbons like polyethylene or paraffin wax. Water-extended polyester (WEP) is effective as a shielding wall in harsh environments due to its high hydrogen content and resistance to fire, allowing it to be used in a range of nuclear, health physics, and defense industries. Hydrogen-based materials are suitable for shielding as they are proper barriers against radiation.

Concrete (where a considerable number of water molecules chemically bind to the cement) and gravel provide a cheap solution due to their combined shielding of both gamma rays and neutrons. Boron is also an excellent neutron absorber (and also undergoes some neutron scattering). Boron decays into carbon or helium and produces virtually no gamma radiation with boron carbide, a shield commonly used where concrete would be cost prohibitive. Commercially, tanks of water or fuel oil, concrete, gravel, and B4C are common shields that surround areas of large amounts of neutron flux, e.g., nuclear reactors. Boron-impregnated silica glass, standard borosilicate glass, high-boron steel, paraffin, and Plexiglas have niche uses.

Because neutrons that strike the hydrogen nucleus (proton, or deuteron) impart energy to that nucleus, they in turn break from their chemical bonds and travel a short distance before stopping. Such hydrogen nuclei are high linear energy transfer particles, and are in turn stopped by ionization of the material they travel through. Consequently, in living tissue, neutrons have a relatively high relative biological effectiveness, and are roughly ten times more effective at causing biological damage compared to gamma or beta radiation of equivalent energy exposure. These neutrons can either cause cells to change in their functionality or to completely stop replicating, causing damage to the body over time. Neutrons are particularly damaging to soft tissues like the cornea of the eye.

== Effects on materials ==
High-energy neutrons damage and degrade materials over time; bombardment of materials with neutrons creates collision cascades that can produce point defects and
dislocations in the material, the creation of which is the primary driver behind microstructural changes occurring over time in materials exposed to radiation. At high neutron fluences this can lead to embrittlement of metals and other materials, and to neutron-induced swelling in some of them. This poses a problem for nuclear reactor vessels and significantly limits their lifetime (which can be somewhat prolonged by controlled annealing of the vessel, reducing the number of the built-up dislocations). Graphite neutron moderator blocks are especially susceptible to this effect, known as Wigner effect, and must be annealed periodically. The Windscale fire was caused by a mishap during such an annealing operation.

Radiation damage to materials occurs as a result of the interaction of an energetic incident particle (a neutron, or otherwise) with a lattice atom in the material. The collision causes a massive transfer of kinetic energy to the lattice atom, which is displaced from its lattice site, becoming what is known as the primary knock-on atom (PKA). Because the PKA is surrounded by other lattice atoms, its displacement and passage through the lattice results in many subsequent collisions and the creations of additional knock-on atoms, producing what is known as the collision cascade or displacement cascade. The knock-on atoms lose energy with each collision, and terminate as interstitials, effectively creating a series of Frenkel defects in the lattice. Heat is also created as a result of the collisions (from electronic energy loss), as are possibly transmuted atoms. The magnitude of the damage is such that a single 1 MeV neutron creating a PKA in an iron lattice produces approximately 1,100 Frenkel pairs. The entire cascade event occurs over a timescale of 1 × 10−13 seconds, and therefore, can only be &quot;observed&quot; in computer simulations of the event.

The knock-on atoms terminate in non-equilibrium interstitial lattice positions, many of which annihilate themselves by diffusing back into neighboring vacant lattice sites and restore the ordered lattice. Those that do not or cannot leave vacancies, which causes a local rise in the vacancy concentration far above that of the equilibrium concentration. These vacancies tend to migrate as a result of thermal diffusion towards vacancy sinks (i.e., grain boundaries, dislocations) but exist for significant amounts of time, during which additional high-energy particles bombard the lattice, creating collision cascades and additional vacancies, which migrate towards sinks. The main effect of irradiation in a lattice is the significant and persistent flux of defects to sinks in what is known as the defect wind. Vacancies can also annihilate by combining with one another to form dislocation loops and later, lattice voids.

The collision cascade creates many more vacancies and interstitials in the material than equilibrium for a given temperature, and diffusivity in the material is dramatically increased as a result. This leads to an effect called radiation-enhanced diffusion, which leads to microstructural evolution of the material over time. The mechanisms leading to the evolution of the microstructure are many, may vary with temperature, flux, and fluence, and are a subject of extensive study.

* Radiation-induced segregation results from the aforementioned flux of vacancies to sinks, implying a flux of lattice atoms away from sinks; but not necessarily in the same proportion to alloy composition in the case of an alloyed material. These fluxes may therefore lead to depletion of alloying elements in the vicinity of sinks. For the flux of interstitials introduced by the cascade, the effect is reversed: the interstitials diffuse toward sinks resulting in alloy enrichment near the sink.
* Dislocation loops are formed if vacancies form clusters on a lattice plane. If these vacancy concentration expand in three dimensions, a void forms. By definition, voids are under vacuum, but may became gas-filled in the case of alpha-particle radiation (helium) or if the gas is produced as a result of transmutation reactions. The void is then called a bubble, and leads to dimensional instability (neutron-induced swelling) of parts subject to radiation. Swelling presents a major long-term design problem, especially in reactor components made out of stainless steel. Alloys with crystallographic isotropy, such as Zircaloys are subject to the creation of dislocation loops, but do not exhibit void formation. Instead, the loops form on particular lattice planes, and can lead to irradiation-induced growth, a phenomenon distinct from swelling, but that can also produce significant dimensional changes in an alloy.
*Irradiation of materials can also induce phase transformations in the material: in the case of a solid solution, the solute enrichment or depletion at sinks radiation-induced segregation can lead to the precipitation of new phases in the material.

The mechanical effects of these mechanisms include irradiation hardening, embrittlement, creep, and environmentally-assisted cracking. The defect clusters, dislocation loops, voids, bubbles, and precipitates produced as a result of radiation in a material all contribute to the strengthening and embrittlement (loss of ductility) in the material. Embrittlement is of particular concern for the material comprising the reactor pressure vessel, where as a result the energy required to fracture the vessel decreases significantly. It is possible to restore ductility by annealing the defects out, and much of the life-extension of nuclear reactors depends on the ability to safely do so. Creep is also greatly accelerated in irradiated materials, though not as a result of the enhanced diffusivities, but rather as a result of the interaction between lattice stress and the developing microstructure. Environmentally-assisted cracking or, more specifically, irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) is observed especially in alloys subject to neutron radiation and in contact with water, caused by hydrogen absorption at crack tips resulting from radiolysis of the water, leading to a reduction in the required energy to propagate the crack.

<text>Arctogadus glacialis, known also with ambiguous common names Arctic cod and polar cod, is an Arctic species of fish in the cod family Gadidae, related to the true cod (genus &quot;Gadus&quot;). &quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot; is found in icy water. They grow to about 30 cm long, and are favorite food of narwhals and other arctic whales.

==Common names and taxonomy==
The common names &quot;Arctic cod&quot; and &quot;polar cod&quot; can refer to either &quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot; or &quot;Boreogadus saida&quot;, and &quot;Arctic cod&quot; may also refer to &quot;Eleginus nawaga&quot;.

Another Arctic gadid, the East Siberian cod (&quot;Arctogadus borisovi&quot;), was until recently considered the closest relative of &quot;A. glacialis&quot;. It has, however, been found not to be distinct from &quot;A. glacialis&quot;, and should be included in this species. According to this result, &quot;Arctogadus&quot; is a monotypic genus. However, &quot;Arctogadus&quot; is a close relative of &quot;Boreogadus&quot;, and should perhaps be included in that genus.

==Appearance==

Arctic cod have been cited to grow up to in total length. It has been distinguished from other cod species by its lack of the chin barbel. Populations of Arctic cod previously referred to the East Siberian cod however do have a chin barbel and grow up to 50–60 cm length.
==Distribution==

The Arctic cod is widely distributed in the western part of the Arctic basin and the northwest and northeast coasts of Greenland. Its range is between 85° and 72°N latitude. Arctic cod can be found at depths of up to 1000 m, and frequently under ice.

Fish earlier attributed to the East Siberian cod are found off the western half of the coast of Canada and the coasts of Siberia and also off the northern and southern coasts of Greenland. The fish lives close to the sea floor at depths of 15 to 40 m, but it sometimes enters estuaries, and may also be found under pack ice.

The species is of minor commercial value.

==Diet==

&quot;A. glacialis&quot; in an ice-free area off northeastern Greenland were found to feed almost exclusively on pelagic prey (primarily copepods, amphipods, and mysids).

<doc id="410926" wikidata="Q3144475" url="?curid=410926" title="Hyōshigi">
<text>The is a simple Japanese musical instrument, consisting of two pieces of hardwood or bamboo often connected by a thin ornamental rope. The clappers are played together or on the floor to create a cracking sound. Sometimes they are struck slowly at first, then faster and faster.

==Theater==
&quot;Hyōshigi&quot; are used in traditional Japanese theaters, such as Kabuki and Bunraku theater, to announce the beginning of a performance. The kyogen-kata usually plays the hyoshigi at the start of comedic plays. It can be used to attract the attention of the audience by conductors for theater and even athletic and juggling performances. &quot;Hyōshigi&quot; are also used to stress confusion, and other dramatic moments, in the play.

==Religion==
It is also often used to signal the starting or the end of parts of festivals, especially in the directing of the mikoshi.

&quot;Hyōshigi&quot; is combined with other traditional Japanese instruments in &quot;mikagura-uta&quot;, or cycle of songs, which is characteristic of the Tenrikyo religion.

==Other uses==
The clapping instrument was also used in &quot;Kamishibai&quot; to gather children so that the &quot;Kamishibai&quot; man could sell candy and entertain them with his story.

The wooden percussion instrument was also used by night-watchmen when patrolling the streets.

Volunteer Fire Corps (&quot;Shōbōdan&quot;) patrols use the Hyoshigi during their night-patrols (&quot;yomawari&quot;) warning people about the danger of fire.

<doc id="410928" wikidata="Q7245740" url="?curid=410928" title="Prison Fellowship">
<text>Prison Fellowship is the world&#x27;s largest Christian nonprofit organization for prisoners, former prisoners, and their families, and a leading advocate for justice reform.

== History ==
Prison Fellowship was founded in 1976 by Charles W. Colson, a former Richard Nixon aide who served a seven-month prison sentence for a Watergate-related crime. In 1979, Prison Fellowship International was founded as an international outreach to prisoners and a sister organization of Prison Fellowship.

In 1982, former prisoner Mary K. Beard joined Prison Fellowship to lead the Angel Tree program for prisoners and their families. The 1980s brought additional growth to the organization with the justice reform division formerly known as Justice Fellowship.

While the organization has always sought to provide faith-based programming to those in prison, the 1990s saw a rise in more intensive programs provided by the organization that sought to integrate education, life-skills, and counseling into a holistic program for prisoners in certain jurisdictions.

In 2014, the organization announced its intention to visit every prison in the United States in the next six years. In 2016, Prison Fellowship began partnering with Zondervan to provide families a Bible along with the gifts their children receive through the Angel Tree program. In 2018, the Prison Fellowship lobbied for the passing of the First Step Act (Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act) backed by the Trump administration.

Today Prison Fellowship is active in all 50 states, with programs impacting more than 1,000 prisons. Prison Fellowship programming reaches more than 365,000 incarcerated men and women each year.

== Description ==
=== Academy ===

Located in select prisons across the country, the Prison Fellowship Academy takes incarcerated men and women through a holistic life transformation spanning weeks or months, where they are guided by Prison Fellowship staff and volunteers to lead lives of purpose and productivity inside and outside of prison. Using proven approaches and biblically based curricula, the Academy guides participants to identify the life-controlling issues that led to their incarceration and take responsibility for its impact on their community.

Prison Fellowship is active in all 50 states with more than 268,000 volunteers. Prison Fellowship facilitates classes that 26,000 prisoners participate in each month. Within prisons, the ministry organizes evangelism events, Bible study, discipleship courses, life-skills classes, and mentorship and reentry programs.

Thousands of trained Prison Fellowship volunteers across the country regularly lead small-group studies and seminars on topics such as substance abuse recovery, parenting, and life skills. Prison Fellowship Hope Events are one- or two-day evangelism events in prisons which include yard events featuring inspirational speakers, musicians, and other attractions.

Angel Tree is a Prison Fellowship program that serves incarcerated parents by offering them a pathway to restore and strengthen relationships with their children and families. Every Christmas, Angel Tree mobilizes local churches and organizations to minister to hundreds of thousands of children by delivering a gift, the Gospel message, and a personal message of love on behalf of their mom or dad behind bars.

=== &quot;Inside Journal&quot; ===
&quot;Inside Journal&quot; is a quarterly newspaper printed and distributed by Prison Fellowship via chaplains, program coordinators, and in-prison volunteers to correctional facilities across the country. Written specifically for incarcerated men and women, this publication seeks to provide encouragement and motivation, the message of the Gospel, and practical advice for the daily struggles of prison life. &quot;Inside Journal&quot; is provided in a men’s edition, a women’s edition, and a Spanish-language edition. As of September 2017, all editions are printed in full color.

Distributed to correctional facilities of all sizes, security levels, and types (county, state, federal, military, and more), &quot;Inside Journal&quot; circulates more than 836,000 copies per year, with plans for increasing to one million by 2021. It currently reaches more than 200,000 prisoners at more than 800 correctional facilities throughout North America.

=== Warden Exchange ===
Warden Exchange is an innovative program of Prison Fellowship that equips wardens to be transformative leaders in building safer, more constructive, and more rehabilitative correctional environments.

Warden Exchange convenes wardens, deputy wardens, associate wardens, top corrections specialists, and subject-matter experts in an in-depth, nine-month leadership training program that examines and applies best practices for creating safer and more rehabilitative prisons. It incorporates weekly live video conferences and in-person residential conferences led by experts in criminal justice, law, business, and education. Participants graduate from the program with individualized action plans to bring change to their facilities.

Warden Exchange focuses on the opportunity that wardens have to influence the culture of their prisons and support the rehabilitation of the prisoners under their charge. Relying on critical thinking, dynamic conversations, and transformational methodologies, Warden Exchange immerses participants in paradigm-changing sessions. At the core is a belief that allowing for effective moral rehabilitation of prisoners can activate real change in individuals and break the cycle of crime and recidivism.

== Criminal justice reform ==

=== Justice reform ===
Prison Fellowship advocates for criminal justice reforms that transform those responsible for crime, validate victims, and encourages churches and communities to play a role in creating a safe, redemptive, and just society. On the state and federal levels, Prison Fellowship advocates for justice that restores, an approach to criminal justice that recognizes the value and potential of every human life.

Prison Fellowship has worked with members of Congress to pass the following pieces of criminal justice reform legislation: the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1993), the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (2000), the Prison Rape Elimination Act (2003), the Second Chance Act (2008), the Fair Sentencing Act (2010), and the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) as well as a variety of state-level criminal justice reforms.

Prison Fellowship also works to mobilize churches, organizations, and individuals to raise awareness and advocate for justice that restores.

===Faith &amp; Justice Fellowship===
In 2016, Prison Fellowship mobilized the Faith &amp; Justice Fellowship, a bipartisan body including members of Congress, governors, and state legislators motivated by their various faith traditions and committed to prioritizing and advancing restorative values in criminal justice reform.

Prominent legislators and state executives have joined Prison Fellowship in pledging to advance restorative criminal justice reforms and focus the national dialogue on the value and dignity of all human life. These men and women recognize that no one is beyond help, and are committed to working for policies that bring hope and wholeness to those impacted by crime and incarceration.

===Justice Declaration===
Signed by more than 100 prominent Christian leaders including Francis Chan. The Justice Declaration, created by Prison Fellowship and its partners, is a statement of criminal justice principles based on the God-given dignity and potential of all people. The authors and signers of the declaration call upon the Christian Church to deploy its unparalleled capacity to respond to crime and over-incarceration.

===Outrageous Justice===
In 2016, Prison Fellowship launched Outrageous Justice, a multimedia small-group curriculum and companion book that makes Christians aware of the current crisis in the criminal justice system, and then activates them to respond by caring for victims of crime and prisoners and advocating for restorative reforms. Developed by subject-matter experts, it weaves current events, biblical context, and personal stories into a compelling conversation about effecting restorative change. Outrageous Justice is a great tool for churches and communities looking to respond to incarceration and injustice in America.

===Second Chance Month===

Prison Fellowship founded Second Chance Month in 2017 to change perceptions and unlock second-chance opportunities for millions of Americans who have completed their sentences.

<text>The Sea, The Sea is a novel by Iris Murdoch. Published in 1978, it was her nineteenth novel. It won the 1978 Booker Prize.

== Plot ==

&quot;The Sea, The Sea&quot; is a tale of the strange obsessions that haunt a self-satisfied playwright and director as he begins to write his memoirs. Murdoch&#x27;s novel exposes the motivations that drive his character – the vanity, jealousy, and lack of compassion behind the disguises they present to the world. Charles Arrowby, its central figure, decides to withdraw from the world and live in seclusion in a house by the sea. While there, he encounters his first love, Mary Hartley Fitch, whom he has not seen since his love affair with her as an adolescent. Although she is almost unrecognisable in old age, and outside his theatrical world, he becomes obsessed with her, idealising his former relationship with her and attempting to persuade her to elope with him. His inability to recognise the egotism and selfishness of his own romantic ideals is at the heart of the novel. After the farcical and abortive kidnapping of Mrs. Fitch by Arrowby, he is left to mull over her rejection in a self-obsessional and self-aggrandising manner over the space of several chapters. &quot;How much, I see as I look back, I read into it all, reading my own dream text and not looking at the reality... Yes of course I was in love with my own youth... Who is one&#x27;s first love?&quot;

== Title ==

Iris Murdoch&#x27;s biographer Peter J. Conradi gives Xenophon as the ultimate source of the title. According to Xenophon&#x27;s Anabasis, &quot;The Sea! The Sea!&quot; (&quot;Thalatta! Thalatta!&quot;) was the shout of exultation given by the roaming 10,000 Greeks when, in 401 BC, they caught sight of the Black Sea from Mount Theches in Trebizond and realised they were saved from death. Conradi states that the direct source of the title is Paul Valéry&#x27;s poem &quot;Le Cimetiere Marin&quot; (&quot;The Graveyard by the Sea&quot;). A line in the poem&#x27;s first stanza quotes the Greeks&#x27; shouts: &quot;La mer, la mer, toujours recommencėe&quot; (The Sea, the sea, forever restarting). Murdoch refers to the poem in several of her books, and this stanza appears in full at the end of chapter 4 in her 1963 novel &quot; The Unicorn&quot;.

== Dedication ==

The work is dedicated to the archaeologist and academic Rosemary Cramp, to whom Murdoch was tutor at St Anne&#x27;s.

== Adaptations ==

A four-part adaptation of &quot;The Sea, The Sea&quot; by Richard Crane, directed by Faynia Williams appeared as the Classic Serial on BBC Radio 3 in 1993. The actors included John Wood as Charles Arrowby, Joyce Redman as Hartley Fitch, with Siân Phillips, Sam Crane &amp; Peter Kelly. Episode 3 included an interview with Iris Murdoch.

A two-part adaptation of &quot;The Sea, The Sea&quot; by Robin Brooks appeared on BBC Radio 4 in August 2015. The actors included Jeremy Irons as Charles Arrowby, Maggie Steed as Hartley Fitch, and Simon Williams as James Arrowby.

== Awards ==

The book won Murdoch the 1978 Booker Prize. In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

<text>Charles Wendell Colson (October 16, 1931 – April 21, 2012), generally referred to as Chuck Colson, was an American attorney and political advisor who served as Special Counsel to President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1970. Once known as President Nixon&#x27;s &quot;hatchet man&quot;, Colson gained notoriety at the height of the Watergate scandal, for being named as one of the Watergate Seven and also for pleading guilty to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974, Colson served seven months in the federal Maxwell Prison in Alabama, as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges.

Colson became an evangelical Christian in 1973. His mid-life religious conversion sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry Prison Fellowship and, three years later, Prison Fellowship International, to a focus on Christian worldview teaching and training around the world. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books. He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview, and which produces Colson&#x27;s daily radio commentary, BreakPoint, heard on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States currently presented by John Stonestreet.

Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together&quot; ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States.

Colson received 15 honorary doctorates and in 1993 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world&#x27;s largest annual award (over US$1 million) in the field of religion, given to a person who &quot;has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life&#x27;s spiritual dimension&quot;. He donated the prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush.

== Early life, education, and family ==
Charles Wendell Colson was born on October 16, 1931 in Boston, the son of Inez &quot;Dizzy&quot; (née Ducrow) and Wendell Ball Colson. He was of Swedish and British descent.

In his youth, Colson had seen the charitable works of his parents. His mother cooked meals for the hungry during the Depression and his father donated his legal services to the United Prison Association of New England.

During World War II, Colson organized fund-raising campaigns in his school for the war effort that raised enough money to buy a Jeep for the army. In 1948, he volunteered in the campaign to re-elect the Governor of Massachusetts, Robert Bradford.

After turning down a full scholarship to Harvard University and attending Browne &amp; Nichols School in Cambridge in 1949, he earned his AB, with honors, in history from Brown University in 1953, and his J.D., with honors, from George Washington University Law School in 1959. At Brown, he was a member of Beta Theta Pi.

Colson&#x27;s first marriage was to Nancy Billings in 1953; they have three children, Wendell Ball II (born 1954), Christian Billings (1956), and Emily Ann (1958). After some years of separation, the marriage ended in divorce in January 1964. He married Patricia Ann Hughes on April 4, 1964.

== Early career ==
Colson served in the United States Marine Corps from 1953 to 1955, reaching the rank of captain. From 1955 to 1956, he was the assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Material). He worked on the successful 1960 campaign of Leverett Saltonstall (U.S. Republican Party for the U.S. Senate) and was his administrative assistant from 1956 to 1961. In 1961 Colson founded the law firm of Colson &amp; Morin, which swiftly grew to a Boston and Washington, D.C. presence with the addition of former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Edward Gadsby and former Raytheon Company general counsel Paul Hannah. Colson and Morin shortened the name to Gadsby &amp; Hannah in late 1967. Colson left the firm to join the Richard Nixon administration in January 1969.

== Nixon administration ==
=== White House duties ===
In 1968, Colson served as counsel to Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon&#x27;s Key Issues Committee. On November 6, 1969, Colson was appointed as Special Counsel to President Nixon.

Colson was responsible for inviting influential private special interest groups into the White House policy-making process and winning their support on specific issues. His office served as the President&#x27;s political communications liaison with organized labor, veterans, farmers, conservationists, industrial organizations, citizen groups, and almost any organized lobbying group whose objectives were compatible with the Administration&#x27;s. Colson&#x27;s staff broadened the White House lines of communication with organized constituencies by arranging presidential meetings and sending White House news releases of interest to the groups.

In addition to his liaison and political duties, Colson&#x27;s responsibilities included performing special assignments for the president, such as drafting legal briefs on particular issues, reviewing presidential appointments, and suggesting names for White House guest lists. His work also included major lobbying efforts on such issues as construction of an antiballistic missile system, the president&#x27;s Vietnamization program, and the administration&#x27;s revenue-sharing proposal.

=== &quot;The &#x27;Evil Genius&#x27; of an Evil Administration&quot; ===
&quot;Slate&quot; magazine writer David Plotz described Colson as Nixon&#x27;s &quot;hard man, the &#x27;evil genius&#x27; of an evil administration.&quot; Colson has written that he was &quot;valuable to the President... because I was willing... to be ruthless in getting things done&quot;. Nixon&#x27;s White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman described Colson as being the president&#x27;s &quot;hit man&quot;.

Colson authored the 1971 memo listing Nixon&#x27;s major political opponents, later known as Nixon&#x27;s enemies list. A quip that &quot;Colson would walk over his own grandmother if necessary&quot; mutated into claims in news stories that Colson had boasted that he would run over his own grandmother to re-elect Nixon. In a conversation on February 13, 1973, Colson told Nixon that he had always had &quot;a little prejudice&quot;.

=== New York City Hard Hat Riot ===

On May 4, 1970, four students were shot dead at Kent State University in Ohio while protesting the Vietnam War and the incursion into Cambodia. As a show of sympathy for the dead students, Mayor John Lindsay ordered all flags at New York City Hall to be flown at half-mast that same day.

A transcription made of a White House tape recording dated May 5, 1971, documents that the planning phase of the Hard Hat Riot took place in the White House Oval Office. Colson is heard successfully instigating several New York State AFL–CIO union leaders into organizing an attack against student protesters in New York. The officials armed about 200 construction workers in Lower Manhattan with lengths of steel re-bar which they, along with their hard hats, proceeded to use against about 1,000 high school and college students protesting the Vietnam War and the Kent State shootings. The initial attack was near the intersection of Wall Street and Broad Street, but the riot soon spread to New York City Hall and lasted a little longer than two hours. More than 70 people were injured, including four policemen. Six people were arrested.

Two weeks after the Hard Hat Riot, Colson arranged a White House ceremony honoring the union leader most responsible for the attack, Peter J. Brennan, president of the Building and Construction Trades local for New York City. Brennan was later appointed U.S. Secretary of Labor and served under Presidents Nixon and Gerald Ford.

=== Proposals ===
Colson also proposed firebombing the Brookings Institution and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put out the fire.

In his memoir, E. Howard Hunt reports that the day after the attempted assassination of George Wallace by Arthur Bremer, he received a call from Chuck Colson, asking him to break into Bremer&#x27;s apartment and plant &quot;leftist literature to connect him to the Democrats&quot;. Hunt recalls that he was highly skeptical of the plan due to the apartment being guarded by the FBI but investigated the feasibility of it anyway due to Colson&#x27;s insistence.

In 1972, on Colson&#x27;s orders, Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy were part of an assassination plot targeting journalist Jack Anderson. Nixon disliked Anderson because Anderson published a 1960 election-eve story about a secret loan from Howard Hughes to Nixon&#x27;s brother, which Nixon believed was a factor in his election defeat to John F. Kennedy. Hunt and Liddy met with a CIA operative and discussed methods of assassinating Anderson, which included covering Anderson&#x27;s car steering wheel with LSD to drug him and cause a fatal accident, poisoning his aspirin bottle, and staging a fatal robbery. The assassination plot never materialized because Hunt and Liddy were arrested for their involvement in the Watergate scandal later that year.

=== Attacking the young Vietnam veteran John Kerry ===
Colson&#x27;s voice, from archives of April 1969, is heard in the 2004 movie &quot;Going Upriver&quot; deprecating the anti-war efforts of John Kerry. Colson&#x27;s orders were to &quot;destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another Ralph Nader.&quot; In a phone conversation with Nixon on April 28, 1971, Colson said, &quot;This fellow Kerry that they had on last week... He turns out to be really quite a phony.&quot;

== Watergate and Ellsberg scandals ==

Colson attended some meetings of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP). However, he and the White House Staff &quot;had come to regard the Committee to Re-elect the President as a rival organization.&quot; When Colson had taken charge of the Office of Communications, he was offered but rejected Jeb Magruder as a senior staffer, and Magruder was instead sent over to CRP, as

At a CRP meeting on March 21, 1971, it was agreed to spend US$250,000 on &quot;intelligence gathering&quot; on the Democratic Party. Colson and John Ehrlichman had recruited E. Howard Hunt as a White House consultant for $100 per day ($ in dollars). Though Hunt never worked directly for Colson, he did several odd jobs for Colson&#x27;s office prior to working for Egil &quot;Bud&quot; Krogh, head of the White House Special Operations Unit (the so-called &quot;Plumbers&quot;), which had been organized to stop leaks in the Nixon administration. Hunt teamed with G. Gordon Liddy, and the two headed the Plumbers&#x27; attempted burglary of Pentagon Papers-leaker Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist&#x27;s office in Los Angeles in September 1971. The Pentagon Papers were a collection of military documents comprising an exhaustive study of the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War. Their publication helped increase opposition to the war. Colson hoped that revelations about Ellsberg could be used to discredit the anti-Vietnam War cause. Colson admitted to leaking information from Ellsberg&#x27;s confidential FBI file to the press, but denied organizing Hunt&#x27;s burglary of Ellsberg&#x27;s office. In his 2005 book &quot;The Good Life&quot;, Colson expressed regret for attempting to cover up the incident.

Although not discovered until several years after Nixon had resigned and Colson had finished serving his prison term, the transcript of a White House conversation between Nixon and Colson tape-recorded on June 20, 1972, has denials from both men of the White House&#x27;s involvement in the break-in. Hunt had been off the payroll for three months. Colson asks, &quot;Do they think I&#x27;m that dumb?&quot; Nixon comments that &quot;we have got to have lawyers smart enough to have our people de-, delay (unintelligible) avoiding--depositions, of course, uh, are one possibility. We&#x27;ve got –I think it would be a quite the thing for the judge to call in Mitchell and have a deposition in the middle of the campaign, don&#x27;t you?&quot; to which Colson responds that he would welcome a deposition because &quot;I&#x27;m not –, because nobody, everybody&#x27;s completely out of it.&quot;

On March 10, 1973, 17 months before Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Colson resigned from the White House to return to the private practice of law, as Senior Partner at the law firm of Colson and Shapiro, Washington, D.C. However, Colson was retained as a special consultant by Nixon for several more months.

=== Indicted ===
On March 1, 1974, Colson was indicted for conspiring to cover up the Watergate burglaries.

=== Introduced to evangelical Christianity ===
As Colson was facing arrest, his close friend Thomas L. Phillips, chairman of the board of Raytheon Company, gave him a copy of &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C. S. Lewis; after reading it, Colson became an evangelical Christian. 

Colson then joined a prayer group led by Douglas Coe and including Democratic Senator Harold Hughes, Republican congressman Al Quie and Democratic congressman Graham B. Purcell, Jr. When news of the conversion emerged much later, several U.S. newspapers, as well as &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; ridiculed the conversion, claiming that it was a ploy to reduce his sentence. In his 1975 memoir &quot;Born Again&quot;, Colson noted that a few writers published sympathetic stories, as in the case of a widely reprinted UPI article, &quot;From Watergate to Inner Peace.&quot;

=== Pleads guilty, imprisoned ===
After taking the Fifth Amendment on the advice of his lawyers during early testimony, Colson found himself torn between his convictions as a Christian and his desire to avoid conviction on charges of which he believed himself innocent. After prayer and consultation with his fellowship group, Colson approached his lawyers and suggested a plea of guilty to a different criminal charge of which he did consider himself to be culpable.

After days of negotiation with Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski and Watergate Trial Judge Gerhard Gesell, Colson pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice on the basis of having attempted to defame Ellsberg&#x27;s character in the build-up to the trial in order to influence the jury against him. Journalist Carl Rowan commented in a column of June 10, 1974, that the guilty plea came &quot;at a time when the judge was making noises about dismissing the charges against him&quot;, and speculated that Colson was preparing to reveal highly damaging information against Nixon, an expectation shared by columnist Clark Mollenhoff; Mollenhoff even went so far as to suggest that for Colson &quot;not&quot; to become a &quot;devastating witness&quot; would cast doubt on the sincerity of his conversion. On June 21, 1974, Colson was given a one-to- three-year sentence and fined $5,000. He was subsequently disbarred in the District of Columbia, with the expectation of his also being prohibited from using his licenses from Virginia and Massachusetts.

Colson served seven months in Maxwell Correctional Facility in Alabama,—with brief stints at a facility on the Fort Holabird grounds when needed as a trial witness— entering prison on July 9, 1974, and being released early, on January 31, 1975, by the sentencing judge because of family problems. At the time that Gesell ordered his release, Colson was one of the last of the Watergate defendants still in jail: only Gordon Liddy was still incarcerated. Egil Krogh had served his sentence and been released before Colson entered jail, while John Dean, Jeb Magruder, and Herb Kalmbach had been released earlier in January 1975 by Judge John Sirica. Although Gesell declined to name the &quot;family problems&quot; prompting the release, Colson wrote in his 1976 memoir that his son Chris, angry over his father&#x27;s imprisonment and looking to replace his broken car, had bought $150 worth of marijuana in hopes of selling it at a profit, and had been arrested in South Carolina, where he was in college. The state later dropped the charges.

=== Interest in prison reform ===
&quot;Born Again&quot;, Colson&#x27;s personal memoir reflecting on his religious conversion and prison term, was made into a 1978 dramatic film starring Dean Jones as Colson, Anne Francis as his wife Patty, and Harold Hughes as himself. Actor Kevin Dunn portrayed Colson in the 1995 movie &quot;Nixon&quot;.

While in prison, Colson had become increasingly aware of what he saw as injustices done to prisoners and incarcerates and shortcomings in their rehabilitation; he also had the opportunity, during a three-day furlough to attend his father&#x27;s funeral, to pore over his father&#x27;s papers and discover the two shared an interest in prison reform. He became convinced that he was being called by God to develop a ministry to prisoners with an emphasis in promoting changes in the justice system.

== Career after prison ==

=== Prison ministry ===
After his release from prison, Colson founded Prison Fellowship in 1976, which today is &quot;the nation&#x27;s largest outreach to prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families&quot;. Colson worked to promote prisoner rehabilitation and reform of the prison system in the United States, citing his disdain for what he called the &quot;lock &#x27;em and leave &#x27;em&quot; warehousing approach to criminal justice. He helped to create prisons whose populations come from inmates who choose to participate in faith-based programs.

In 1979, Colson founded Prison Fellowship International to extend his prison outreach outside the United States. Now in 120 countries, Prison Fellowship International is the largest, most extensive association of national Christian ministries working within the criminal justice field, working to proclaim the Gospel worldwide and alleviate the suffering of prisoners and their families. In 1983, Prison Fellowship International received special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. During this time, Colson also founded Justice Fellowship, using his influence in conservative political circles to push for bipartisan, legislative reforms in the U.S. criminal justice system.

On June 18, 2003, Colson was invited by President George W. Bush to the White House to present results of a scientific study on the faith-based initiative, InnerChange, at the Carol Vance Unit (originally named the Jester II Unit) prison facility of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Fort Bend County, Texas. Colson led a small group that included Byron Johnson of the University of Pennsylvania, who was the principal researcher of the InnerChange study, a few staff members of Prison Fellowship and three InnerChange graduates to the meeting. In the presentation, Johnson explained that 171 participants in the InnerChange program were compared to a matched group of 1,754 inmates from the prison&#x27;s general population. The study found that only 8 percent of InnerChange graduates, as opposed to 20.3 percent of inmates in the matched comparison group, became offenders again in a two-year period. In other words, the recidivism rate was cut by almost two-thirds for those who complete the faith-based program. Those who are dismissed for disciplinary reasons or who drop out voluntarily, or those who are paroled before completion, have a comparable rate of rearrest and incarceration. The commonly-reported results from the study have been strongly criticized for selecting only participants who were unlikely to be rearrested (especially those who were successfully placed in post-prison jobs), and when considering all of the InnerChange study participants, their recidivism rate (24.3%) was worse than the control group (20.3%).

=== Christian advocacy ===
Colson maintained a variety of media channels which discuss contemporary issues from an evangelical Christian worldview. In his &quot;Christianity Today&quot; columns, for example, Colson opposed same-sex marriage, and argued that Darwinism is used to attack Christianity. He also argued against evolution and in favor of intelligent design, asserting that Darwinism led to forced sterilizations by eugenicists.

Colson was an outspoken critic of postmodernism, believing that as a cultural worldview, it is incompatible with the Christian tradition. He debated prominent post-evangelicals, such as Brian McLaren, on the best response for the evangelical church in dealing with the postmodern cultural shift. Colson, however, came alongside the creation care movement when endorsing Christian environmentalist author Nancy Sleeth&#x27;s &quot;Go Green, Save Green: A Simple Guide to Saving Time, Money, and God&#x27;s Green Earth&quot;. In the early 1980s, Colson was invited to New York by David Frost&#x27;s variety program on NBC for an open debate with Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair, the atheist who, in 1963, brought the court case (&quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot;) that eliminated official public school prayers.

Colson was a member of the Family (also known as the Fellowship), described by prominent evangelical Christians as one of the most politically well-connected fundamentalist organizations in the US. On April 4, 1991, Colson was invited to deliver a speech as part of the Distinguished Lecturer series at Harvard Business School. The speech was titled &quot;The Problem of Ethics&quot;, where he argued that a society without a foundation of moral absolutes cannot long survive.

Colson was later a principal signer of the 1994 &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together&quot; ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States, part of a larger ecumenical rapprochement in the United States that had begun in the 1970s with Catholic-Evangelical collaboration during the Gerald R. Ford Administration and in later para-church organizations such as Moral Majority founded by Rev. Jerry Falwell at the urging of Francis Schaeffer and his son Frank Schaeffer during the Jimmy Carter administration.

In November 2009, Colson was a principal writer and driving force behind an ecumenical statement known as the &quot;Manhattan Declaration&quot; calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences. He had previously ignited controversy within Protestant circles for his mid-90s common-ground initiative with conservative Roman Catholics &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together&quot;, which Colson wrote alongside prominent Roman Catholic Richard John Neuhaus. Colson was also a proponent of the Bible Literacy Project&#x27;s curriculum &quot;The Bible and Its Influence&quot; for public high school literature courses. Colson has said that Protestants have a special duty to prevent anti-Catholic bigotry.

=== Political engagement ===
In 1988, Colson became involved with the Elizabeth Morgan case, visiting Morgan in jail and lobbying to change federal law in order to free her.

On October 3, 2002, Colson was one of the co-signers of the Land letter sent to President George W. Bush. The letter was written by Richard D. Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention and co-signed by four prominent American evangelical Christian leaders with Colson among them. The letter outlined their theological support for a just war in the form of a pre-emptive invasion of Iraq.

On June 1, 2005, Colson appeared in the national news commenting on the revelation that W. Mark Felt was Deep Throat. Colson expressed disapproval in Felt&#x27;s role in the Watergate scandal, first in the context of Felt being an FBI employee who should have known better than to disclose the results of a government investigation to the press (violating a fundamental tenet of FBI culture), and second in the context of the trust placed in him (which demanded a more active response, such as a face-to-face confrontation with the FBI director or Nixon or, had that failed, public resignation). His criticism of Felt provoked a harsh response from Benjamin Bradlee, former executive editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, one of only three individuals to know who Deep Throat was prior to the public disclosure, who said he was &quot;baffled&quot; that Colson and Liddy were &quot;lecturing the world about public morality&quot; considering their role in the Watergate scandal. Bradlee stated that &quot;as far as I&#x27;m concerned they have no standing in the morality debate.&quot;

Colson also supported the passage of Proposition 8. He signed his name to a full-page ad in the December 5, 2008 &quot;The New York Times&quot; that objected to violence and intimidation against religious institutions and believers in the wake of the passage of Proposition 8. The ad said that &quot;violence and intimidation are always wrong, whether the victims are believers, gay people, or anyone else.&quot; A dozen other religious and human rights activists from several different faiths also signed the ad, noting that they &quot;differ on important moral and legal questions&quot;, including Proposition 8.

== Awards and honors ==

From 1982 to 1995, Colson received honorary doctorates from various colleges and universities.

In 1990, The Salvation Army recognized Colson with its highest civic award, the Others Award. Previous recipients of the award include Barbara Bush, Paul Harvey, US Senator Bob Dole, and the Meadows Foundation.

In 1993, Colson was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world&#x27;s largest cash gift (over $1 million), which is given each year to the one person in the world who has done the most to advance the cause of religion. He donated the prize, as he did all speaking fees and royalties, to further the work of Prison Fellowship.

In 1994, Colson was quoted in contemporary Christian music artist Steven Curtis Chapman&#x27;s song &quot;Heaven in the Real World&quot; as saying:

In 1999, Colson co-authored &quot;How Now Shall We Live?&quot; with Nancy Pearcey and published by Tyndale House. The book was winner of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association 2000 Gold Medallion Book Award in the &quot;Christianity and Society&quot; category. Colson had previously won the 1993 Gold Medallion award in the &quot;Theology/Doctrine&quot; category for &quot;The Body&quot; co-authored with Ellen Santilli Vaughn, published by Word, Inc.

On February 9, 2001, the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU) presented Colson with the Mark O. Hatfield Leadership Award at the Forum on Christian Higher Education in Orlando, Florida. The award is presented to individuals who have demonstrated uncommon leadership that reflects the values of Christian higher education. The award was established in 1997 in honor of US Senator Mark Hatfield, a long-time supporter of the council.

In 2008, Colson was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush.

== Later years ==
In 2000, Florida Governor Jeb Bush reinstated the rights which were taken away by Colson&#x27;s felony conviction, including the right to vote.

On March 31, 2012, Colson underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain after he fell ill while speaking at a Christian worldview conference. CBN erroneously reported on April 18, 2012, that he died with his family at his side but Prison Fellowship later (12:30am on April 19 and again at 7:02am) pointed out that he was still alive as of that moment.

== Death ==
On April 21, 2012, Colson died in the hospital &quot;from complications resulting from a brain hemorrhage&quot;.

== Books ==

Colson had a long list of publications and collaborations, including over 30 books which have sold more than 5 million copies. He also wrote forewords for several other books.

<doc id="410939" wikidata="Q841920" url="?curid=410939" title="Ulzana's Raid">
<text>Ulzana&#x27;s Raid is a 1972 American revisionist Western film starring Burt Lancaster, Richard Jaeckel, Bruce Davison and Joaquin Martinez. The film, which was filmed on location in Arizona, was directed by Robert Aldrich based on a script by Alan Sharp. It portrays a brutal raid by Chiricahua Apaches against European settlers in 1880s Arizona.
The bleak and nihilistic tone of U.S. troops chasing an elusive merciless enemy has been seen as allegory to the United States participation in the Vietnam War.

==Plot==
Following mistreatment by Indian agency authorities, Ulzana breaks out of the San Carlos Indian Reservation with a small Chiricahua war party. When news reaches Fort Lowell, the commanding officer sends riders out to alert the local settlers. However, both troopers are ambushed separately; one is dragged away while the other kills the European woman he is escorting and then himself. The Apaches play catch with his liver. The woman&#x27;s husband, who stayed behind to protect his farm, is captured and tortured to death. McIntosh, an ageing U.S. Army scout, is ordered to bring in Ulzana. Joining him will be a few dozen soldiers led by the inexperienced lieutenant, Garnett DeBuin, a veteran Cavalry sergeant and Ke-Ni-Tay, an Apache scout. Ke-Ni-Tay knows Ulzana because their wives are sisters.

The cavalry troop soon discover the brutal activities of the Apache war party. The soldiers know they are facing a merciless enemy with far better local skills. DeBuin is shocked by the cruelty and harshness he sees because it conflicts strongly with his Christian morality and view of humanity. After failing to find Ulzana, McIntosh and Ke-Ni-Tay consider how to outwit their enemy. But DeBuin remains cautious and mistrustful of Ke-Ni-Tay because Ulzana did not let him join his war party.

Ulzana and his warriors decide to continue on foot to tire out the pursuing cavalry while their horses are circuitously led back the other way. However, after Ke-Ni-Tay notices that the tracks are of unladen ponies, McIntosh leads an ambush that kills the horses and their two Apache escorts; one of whom was Ulzana&#x27;s son. Despite angry protestations, DeBuin forbids his men from mutilating the dead boy.

The war party attack another farm, burning the homesteader to death and seizing two horses. McIntosh realizes that the remaining Apaches physically and psychologically need horses and will try to obtain them by raiding the troop. A woman at the burned-out farm, instead of being murdered following her gang rape, was left alive but injured so that the cavalry will be forced to send her to the fort with an escort. By splitting the troop, Ulzana hopes to successfully attack the escort and seize its horses. McIntosh suggests a decoy plan to make Ulzana falsely believe that his tactics are successful.

Ulzana&#x27;s warriors ambush the small escort detachment obtaining all of its horses and killing the sergeant and his soldiers before DeBuin can arrive with the rest of his force. McIntosh is left mortally wounded. Only the woman survives unharmed though now apparently crazed by her experiences. Ke-Ni-Tay scatters the captured horses just as bugle calls from the cavalry ineptly alert the Apaches to DeBuin&#x27;s approach. Ulzana flees on foot as the remnants of his band are killed. Ke-Ni-Tay confronts him and shows him the Army bugle taken from the body of his son. Ulzana puts down his weapons and sings his death song before the Apache scout kills him. A corporal suggests that Ulzana, or at least his head, should be taken back to the fort. However, DeBuin, now hardened by what he has witnessed during the mission, sternly orders him to be buried. Ke-Ni-Tay insists on carrying out the task himself. The surviving troopers led by DeBuin pack up to leave but McIntosh knows that he will not survive the journey back to the fort, so chooses to stay behind to die alone.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film is an original screenplay by Alan Sharp, who said he was inspired by John Ford&#x27;s 1956 western &quot;The Searchers&quot; because he regarded it as &quot;the best film I have ever seen&quot;. Sharp later described &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; as:

Apart from being my sincere homage to Ford [...] an attempt to express allegorically the malevolence of the world and the terror mortals feel in the face of it. We all have our own notions of what constitutes the ultimate in fear, from personal phobias to periods in history. [...] Three historical landscapes that I shudder most to consider are the Third Reich, Turkey during the First World War, and the American Southwest during the years 1860–86. [...] In &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; I am not intent on presenting a reasoned analysis of the relationship between the aboriginie and the colonizer. The events described in the film are accurate in the sense they have factual equivalents, but the final consideration was to present an allegory in whose enlarged features we might perceive the lineaments of our own drama, caricatured, but not falsified. [...] The Ulzana of the &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; is not the Chiricahua Apache of history, whose raid was more protracted and ruthless and daring than the one I had written about. He is the expression of my idea of the Apache as the spirit of the land, the manifestation of its hostility and harshness.

Lancaster later said in 1972 that in his entire career the only &quot;first screenplays&quot; that he really liked were &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; and &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot;.

Aldrich later claimed &quot;From the time we started to the time we finished the picture, I&#x27;d say fifty, sixty percent of it [the script] was changed. Alan Sharp, the writer, was very amenable and terribly helpful. And terribly prolific. He can write twenty-five pages a day. He couldn&#x27;t agree more with my political viewpoint—so that was no problem. And fortunately, Lancaster and I felt pretty much the same about the picture. It was good that I had support from Sharp and Lancaster, because I don&#x27;t have the highest regard for Carter DeHaven, the producer.&quot;

===Casting===
It would be the first time Burt Lancaster and Robert Aldrich had worked together since &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (1954). Aldrich said Lancaster&#x27;s character, John McIntosh, was named after John McIntire, the actor who played the Indian scout Al Sieber in the film &quot;Apache&quot; he directed in 1954. It was an &quot;inside joke ... I&#x27;m not sure that Alan Sharp ever knew just why we did that.&quot;

===Filming===
The film was shot on location in the southeast of Tucson, Arizona, at the Coronado National Forest and in Nogales, as well as in the Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada.

==Versions==
There are two cuts of the film because Burt Lancaster helped to produce the movie. The American release was edited under the supervision of Aldrich while the European version was overseen by Lancaster. Although the overall running times are similar, there are enough differences between the 2 cuts, including several complete scenes found in only one of the versions. A non-authorized version compiled by a German TV station in 1986 combined all scenes from both versions, with a runtime of 111 min.

==Reception==
Although it was not a commercial success, Aldrich said he was &quot;very proud&quot; of the film. Critics such as Gene Siskel wrote that the film was one of the ten best of 1972. Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; also said it was one of the best films of the year.

===Later reputation===
Although the film is considered to be a revisionist Western, it is not through the sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans that is so common in this genre; it is because of its allegorical message about America&#x27;s conduct in the war in Vietnam at that time. American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy has called &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; one of the best Westerns of the 1970s saying it &quot;is also one of the most underestimated pictures of vet director Robert Aldrich, better known for his sci-fi and horror flicks, such as &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane&quot;.&quot;

Quentin Tarantino called it &quot;hands down Aldrich’s best film of the seventies, as well as being one of the greatest westerns of the seventies. One of the things that makes the movie so remarkable is it isn’t just a western; it combines the two genres that Aldrich was most known for, westerns and war films. &quot;

<doc id="410942" wikidata="Q17073374" url="?curid=410942" title="Organic movement">
<text>The organic movement broadly refers to the organizations and individuals involved worldwide in the promotion of organic food and other organic products. It started during the first half of the 20th century, when modern large-scale agricultural practices began to appear.

== Definition ==
An organic product can broadly be described as not containing toxic chemicals (including synthetic pesticides, arsenic-containing herbicides, fertilization biosolids, chemical food additives, antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and industrial solvents). In addition to the absence of artificial chemicals, &quot;organic&quot; means not genetically engineered, and having not used ionizing irradiation, which can cause free-radicals and the removal of vitamins. For example, USDA organic restricts against such things, including genetic engineering in products or in the products&#x27; animal feed, and automatically disallows the use of GMO products as being labelled as Organic and allows the use of &quot;Non-GMO&quot; labelling similar to The Non-GMO Project.

In the United Kingdom, the term used with food is natural food.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
The organic movement began in the early 1900s in response to the shift towards synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides in the early days of industrial agriculture. A relatively small group of farmers came together in various associations: Demeter International of Germany, which encouraged biodynamic farming and began the first certification program, the Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society, the Soil Association of the United Kingdom, and Rodale, Inc. in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, and others. In 1972, these organizations joined to form the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). In recent years, environmental awareness has driven demand and conversion to organic farming. Some governments, including the European Union, have begun to support organic farming through agricultural subsidy reform. Organic production and marketing have grown at a fast pace.

Historians consider Albert Howard, Viscount Lymington, Robert McCarrison, Edgar J. Saxon and Frank Newman Turner as pioneers of the organic movement in Britain, and the term &quot;organic farming&quot; was coined by Lord Northbourne in 1940. 

Today, organic foods stores have captured a significant share of the grocery shopping market, specifically, Whole Foods Market, Wild Oats, Trader Joe&#x27;s and others.

=== Timeline ===
* In the summer of 1924 Rudolf Steiner presented what has been called the first organic agriculture course to a group of over one hundred farmers and others at Koberwitz, now Kobierzyce, Poland.[8] In Germany Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s Spiritual Foundations for the Renewal of Agriculture, published in 1924, led to the popularization of biodynamic agriculture, probably the first comprehensive organic farming system, that was based on Steiner&#x27;s spiritual and philosophical teachings.
* The first use of the term &quot;organic farming&quot; is by Lord Northbourne (aka Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne). The term derives from his concept of &quot;the farm as organism&quot;, which he expounded in his book, Look to the Land (1940), and in which he described a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming. Northbourne wrote of &quot;chemical farming versus organic farming&quot;. http://www.orgprints.org/10138.
* In 1939, strongly influenced by Sir Howard&#x27;s work, Lady Eve Balfour launched the Haughley Experiment on farmland in England. It was the first, side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional farming. Four years later, she published &quot;The Living Soil&quot;, based on the initial findings of the Haughley Experiment. It was widely read, and lead to the formation of a key international organic advocacy group, the Soil Association.
* Sir Albert Howard&#x27;s 1940 book, &quot;An Agricultural Testament&quot;, was influential in promoting organic techniques, and his 1947 book &quot;The Soil and Health, A Study of Organic Agriculture&quot; adopted Northbourne&#x27;s terminology and was the first book to include &quot;organic&quot; agriculture or farming in its title.
* During the 1950s, sustainable agriculture was a research topic of interest. The science tended to concentrate on the new chemical approaches. In the U.S. J. I. Rodale began to popularize the term and methods of organic growing. In addition to agricultural research, Rodale&#x27;s publications through Rodale, Inc. in Emmaus, Pennsylvania helped to promote organic gardening to the general public.
* In 1962, Rachel Carson, a prominent scientist and naturalist, published &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, chronicling the effects of DDT and other pesticides on the environment drawing on the research of biodynamic agriculture advocates Marjorie Spock, Mary T. Richards and Ehrenfried Pfeiffer.[9] A bestseller in many countries, including the US, and widely read around the world, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; was instrumental in the US government&#x27;s 1972 banning of DDT. The book and its author are often credited with launching the environmental movement.
* In the 1970s, worldwide movements concerned with environmental pollution caused by persistent agrichemical increased attention on organic farming. One goal of the &quot;organic movement&quot; was to promote consumption of locally grown food, which was promoted through slogans such as &quot;Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food&quot;.
* In 1972, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), was founded in Versailles, France. IFOAM was dedicated to the diffusion of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In the same year, John Battendieri founded Santa Cruz Organics, which marketed some of the first packaged organic products.[10]
* In the 1980s, around the world, various farming and consumer groups began seriously pressuring for government regulation of organic production to ensure standards of production. This led to various legislation and certification standards being enacted through the 1990s and to date. Currently, most aspects of organic food production are government-regulated in the US and the European Union.
* In the 2000s, the worldwide market for organic products (including food, beauty, health, bodycare, and household products, and fabrics) has grown rapidly. More countries are establishing formal, government-regulated Organic certification. Monitoring and challenging certification rules and decisions have become a regular, high profile aspect of activists in the organic movement.

==Organic companies==
The recent interest in the organic industry has sparked the interest of many businesses from small local distributors to large companies that distribute many products nationally. The organic market is now a 13 billion dollar a year industry, that continues to grow especially from large corporations such as Wal-Mart that are now offering organic choices to their customers. Other companies that offer organic options include General Mills and Kraft. Some large companies have bought smaller already established organic companies such as Earth&#x27;s Best, Rice Dream soy milk, Garden of Eatin&#x27;, Celestial Seasonings and Health Valley. When larger companies buy smaller companies it is called stealth ownership.

==Organic cosmetics==
Organic cosmetics are products that are made with organic ingredients that were produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers.

The FDA does not have a definition of “Organic” in terms of organic cosmetics. FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). 

The USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) requirements for the use of the term “organic” are separate from the laws and regulations that FDA applies for cosmetics. For more information on &quot;organic&quot; labeling for cosmetics, see the NOP publication, &quot;Cosmetics, Body Care Products, and Personal Care Products.&quot; Cosmetic products labeled with “organic” must follow both USDA regulations and FDA regulations of organic claims for labeling and safety requirements for cosmetics.

The Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA supervises the National Organic Program (NOP). The NOP regulations have the definition of &quot;organic&quot; and provide certification for agricultural ingredients if they have been produced under conditions that would meet the definition. Moreover, the regulations also include labeling standards based on the percentage of organic ingredients in every product.

The COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard (COSMOS) sets certification requirements for organic and natural cosmetics products in Europe.

==Organic farming==
== Organic land care and landscaping ==
Organic land care, organic landscaping, or organic lawn management is a form of horticulture that relies on organic land management techniques such as mowing high, proper watering, the use of compost, soil amendments, and organic pest control. 

In the late 20th century, a movement to manage lawns organically began to grow out of the practices of the organic farming movement. Activists in several U.S. cities have pushed local governments to require organic landscaping. Many private properties worldwide are managed organically, but some locations require organic land care. Local regulations are often responding to a lack of regulation from the federal government and billion-dollar settlements against pesticide manufacturers.

The organic land care movement gained public recognition in 1996 when England&#x27;s Prince Charles announced that the Highgrove House gardens and landscaping were under organic management. In 2009, then Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust announced that the campus and grounds were under organic management there implemented by landscape director Wayne Carbone and with savings of two million gallons of irrigation water and resulting in cure of leaf spot and apple scab in the campus orchard. In 2018, Portland, Maine became the largest city in the United States to restrict all synthetic pesticide applications across all public lands and private property. The pesticide ordinance passed by the City Council that includes a fine of up to $500 for violations was lobbied for by environmental groups and community organizer Avery Yale Kamila. In 2019, Rafael Tornini, head of the Garden and Environment Service of the Vatican, announced the 37 acre Gardens of Vatican City had been transitioning to organic management since 2017.

==Criticisms==
There have been multiple criticisms regarding organic food and organic marketing practices. Scientists at the University of Washington did a test of the urine of children who are on organic food diets and children who are on conventional food diets. The result was that the urine of children on organic food diets had a median level of pesticide byproducts only one-sixth of children on conventional food diets. However, at the same time French, British and Swedish government food agencies have all concluded that there was no scientific proof that organic food is safer or has more nutrition than conventional foods.

A 2014 study by a non-profit academic think tank funded by the Council for Biotechnology Information alleged consumers are &quot;routinely deceived&quot; by intentional and endemic misleading health claims in organic marketing. Organic products typically cost 10% to 40% more than similar conventionally produced products. According to the UK&#x27;s Food Standards Agency, &quot;Consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food. However, the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view.&quot; A 12-month systematic review commissioned by the FSA in 2009 and conducted at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine based on 50 years&#x27; worth of collected evidence concluded that &quot;there is no good evidence that consumption of organic food is beneficial to health in relation to nutrient content.&quot; Although the source of the organic movement was small family farms, large corporations have started distributing more organic products and certain categories of organic foods, such as milk, have been reported by Michael Pollan to be highly concentrated and predominantly sourced to mega-farms.

<text>Star Media Group Berhad (doing business as The Star; ) is an English-language newspaper in Malaysia. Based in Petaling Jaya, it was established in 1971 as a regional newspaper in Penang. It is the largest paid English newspaper in terms of circulation in Malaysia, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. It has a daily circulation of about 250,000 (), far eclipsing the circulation of its next-largest paid English-language competitor, the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; (which has a circulation of approximately 65,000). 

&quot;The Star&quot; is a member of the Asia News Network. It is owned by the publicly listed Star Media Group.

== History ==
The daily newspaper was first published on 9 September 1971 as a regional newspaper based in Penang. &quot;The STAR&quot; went into national circulation on 3 January 1976 when it set up its new office in Kuala Lumpur. In 1978, the newspaper headquarters were relocated to Kuala Lumpur. &quot;The Star&quot; continues to expand its wings over the years. In 1981, it moved its headquarters from Kuala Lumpur to Petaling Jaya which is also its current premise to accommodate a growing number of staff and technology devices.

In 1987, &quot;The Star&quot; was one of the newspapers whose publication licences were withdrawn in Operation Lalang. It resumed publication five months later in March 1988, but after its return, &quot;The Star&quot; lost its previous &#x27;liberal flavour&#x27;.

It was the first Malaysian paper to offer an online edition.

&quot;The Star&quot;&#x27;s dominant position as Malaysia&#x27;s leading English-language newspaper has, for decades, been of significant benefit to its major shareholder, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) political party (which was a junior member of the Barisan Nasional coalition that ruled from independence until 2018). Between 1997 and 2007, it was estimated that the MCA&#x27;s investment arm, Huaren Holdings, collected MYR270 million in dividends – almost exclusively from their 42% shareholding in the Star&#x27;s parent company - with dividends peaking at MYR40 million per year between 2005 and 2007. Despite a significant portion of these dividends funding debts from their later acquisition of Nanyang Siang Pau, a total of MYR100 million was still paid out to the MCA between 2001 and 2007.
== Editions ==
&quot;The Star&quot; (daily) and &quot;Sunday Star&quot; are published in five editions. Two editions cover the northern peninsular states of Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and northern Perak, while another two editions cover the rest of the country. As of March 2010, the newspaper has a separate Sarawak edition priced at RM1.20.

There are two main printing plants that publish four editions of &quot;The Star&quot; on a daily basis. The northern editions are printed at the &quot;Star&quot; Northern Hub in Bayan Lepas, Penang, while the other two editions are printed at the &quot;Star&quot; Media Hub in Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, Selangor.

They have also won the Kajai Award, Malaysia&#x27;s most coveted journalism award for two consecutive years.

== Columnists ==
Notable columnists for &quot;The Star&quot; include Marina Mahathir, a socio-political activist and writer, Martin Khor (since 1978), former head of the Third World Network, and law professor Shad Saleem Faruqi.

Popular columnists who also worked at The Star included Wong Chun Wai, June Wong, Dorairaj Nadason and Martin Vengadesan.

Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Prime Minister and chairman of the paper&#x27;s parent company from the 1977 to 1989, also contributed to the newspaper through his column &quot;Looking Back&quot; which was published every Monday from 1974 to 1989. His writings in the column, which consisted of his personal accounts in the ruling party in regards to seeking Malaysia&#x27;s independence, were deemed to be influential and so closely associated with the paper that its name was often backronymed by some readers as &quot;Suara Tunku Abdul Rahman&quot; ().

== Ownership ==
&quot;The Star&quot; is a party-owned paper, associated with the former government of Malaysia. Since 1977, &quot;The Star&quot; has been effectively controlled by the Malaysian Chinese Association, a component party in the Barisan Nasional alliance, though it is part of the publicly listed Star Media Group (MYX: 6084). The largest stake, at 42.46%, is held by the MCA; the three next-largest shareholders are Amanah Saham Bumiputera, a unit trust scheme exclusive to Bumiputera (15.44%), the Malaysian superannuation scheme, the Employees Provident Fund (5.98%) and Tabung Haji, the government-run hajj savings and investment fund (5.42%). In April 2023, The Edge Communications Sdn. Bhd. and its owner Tan Sri Tong Kooi Ong have bought a stake in &quot;The Star&quot;, with Tong owning a direct interest of 0.25% stake and a 5.17% indirect interest through The Edge Communications.

== Reception ==
A 2020 Reuters Institute poll found that 56% of Malaysian respondents trusted reporting from &quot;The Star.&quot; The percentage was tied with &quot;New Straits Times&quot; as the third highest out of the 14 media outlets surveyed.

<text>The New Straits Times is an English-language newspaper published in Malaysia. It is Malaysia&#x27;s oldest newspaper still in print (though not the first), having been founded as a local offshoot of Singapore-based &quot;The Straits Times&quot; on 15 July 1845. It was renamed as the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; on 13 August 1974.

The paper served as Malaysia&#x27;s only broadsheet format English-language newspaper; however, following the example of British newspapers &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;, a tabloid version first rolled off the presses on 1 September 2004 and since 18 April 2005, the newspaper has been published only in tabloid size, ending a 160-year-old tradition of broadsheet publication. The &quot;New Straits Times&quot; currently retails at RM1.50 (~37 US cents) in Peninsular Malaysia.

As of 2 January 2019, the group editor of the newspaper is Rashid Yusof. In 2020, the paper was listed as the 5th most trusted in a Reuters Institute survey of 14 Malaysian media outlets. The &quot;New Straits Times&quot; is considered a newspaper of record for Malaysia.

== History ==
===19th century===
&quot;The Straits Times&quot; was started in Singapore by Armenian merchant Marterus Thaddeus Apcar who had already hired an editor and purchased printing equipment from England; the editor&#x27;s untimely death would forced him to sell all his printing equipment due to bankruptcy.

The buyer Catchick Moses, also an Armenian, established the American Sarkies and Moses Company and hired Robert Carr Woods as editor; it single-handedly edited and published its first issue on 15 July 1845. The paper was launched as an eight-page weekly, published at 7 Commercial Square using a hand-operated press. Woods acquired the paper as owner in 1858, also turned into an afternoon daily merging with Singapore Journal of Commerce and changing its name to the Daily Times. The name change was subsequently reverted in 1883.

===Post-independence===
Singapore&#x27;s separation from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965 made it untenable for The Straits Times to be headquartered in Kuala Lumpur. The impetus for relocation of the newspaper&#x27;s headquarters to Singapore came from the Malaysian government, who found it unacceptable that The Straits Times and its subsidiaries, which had widespread circulation and influence in Malaysia, had nearly 70 percent of its equity capital owned in Singapore.

In 1973, Simmons, then chairman of the Straits Times Group, announced a restructure of the group. This resulted in the formation of two companies: the New Straits Times, which would be a Malaysian publicly owned company; and the Straits Times Press (Singapore), which would be responsible for the group&#x27;s subsidiary companies in Singapore and abroad. 

The Malay Mail Press Company Ltd. later became a public company and was renamed the New Straits Times Press (Malaya) Ltd. the same year. The New Straits Times Press (Malaya) Sdn Bhd. ceased to be the parent company of the New Straits Times (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd in October that year, when Fleet Holdings, an investment arm of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and helmed by Junus Sudin, took over operations. The newspaper name, which at the time remained &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, officially changed its name to &quot;The New Straits Times&quot; on 13 August 1974.

On 11 November 2011, 3D publication was introduced to the paper&#x27;s print and online editions. The newspaper also made history on 21 February 2012 when it became the first talking newspaper, promoting Dutch Lady&#x27;s Friso product, followed by AXIATA&#x27;s page number domination in 2013 and in January 2014 it promoted Wonda Coffee &quot;through five senses&quot; on five consecutive days.

===2011 redesign and new logo===
In 2011, the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; underwent a redesign of its masthead, typography, contents and logo. The first edition in the format was published on 11 November 2011. This lasted until 31 December 2016.

===2017 redesign and new logo===
In 2017, the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; underwent another redesign of its masthead, typography, contents and logo. The redesign also brings new sections and improved news content. The first edition in the current format was published on 1 January 2017, in conjunction with the New Year. In addition, the website was also refreshed in March 2017, with an initiative for a stronger digital presence.

===2019 redesign===

In 2019, the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; underwent a redesign of its masthead and cover design, which now assumes the ambition and scope of a daily newsmagazine. The new design also features more stories on various issues of national interest, with an increased emphasis on the print edition of the newspaper.

== Incorporated sections ==
===&quot;Bots&quot;===

Previously known as Tech&amp;U, the pullout was first published on 1 January 1986 as Computimes, an information and communication technology (ICT) section of the New Straits Times. It was earlier published every Thursday, and in the 1990s, the section was published on Mondays and Thursdays.
On 1 August 2005, a decision was made to focus the Monday edition on the enterprise market while the Thursday edition focuses on the consumer market.
On 1 January 2008, Tech&amp;U became a weekly publication, available with the New Straits Times every Monday with an increasing consumer slant while keeping the pulse on the enterprise scene.
Business Computing is also related to this section. It was a weekly section on Wednesdays, published from 1999 to 2004.
As of 1 March 2010, it has been incorporated and merged into the Life and Times section. The tech section in the New Straits Times, now known as Bots, appears every Monday in the Life &amp; Times section.

===&quot;JOM!&quot;===

Previously known as Travel Times, this weekly pullout on travel in Malaysia was first published in 1999 published in support of the government&#x27;s Cuti-Cuti Malaysia campaign. It became the Malaysian weekly newspaper pullout dedicated to publishing travel and travel-related news and features and has remained till this day Malaysia&#x27;s only weekly travel newspaper pullout dedicated to tourism. The first issue was released on 6 October 1999 and the first weekly issue was released on 2 October 2000. It was published every Wednesday when it started, and it was published on Tuesdays until 23 February 2010 as &quot;Travel&quot;. Starting in March 2010, it has been incorporated and merged into the Life &amp; Times section. The travel section now appears on Thursdays and is known as JOM! meaning Let&#x27;s Go! in the Malay language. This new title is chosen to basically urge travellers to go out into the world and experience all its wonders.

===&quot;Business Times&quot;===

The paper has incorporated the Business Times starting 1 June 2002, expanding its business section and increasing its appeal among businessmen. Prior to 1976, this is also the business section&#x27;s name of the New Straits Times. Not to be confused with the Singaporean newspaper of the same name.

===&quot;Life &amp; Times&quot;===

The segment was previously known as Leisure Times, Times Two and Lifestyle prior to 1994. From 1998 to 2004, the Friday edition of this segment was called Youth Quake after it was merged with the newspaper. The Saturday edition is called Weekend Life &amp; Times, which was later known as 6, from 2005 to 2009.

As of 5 August 2019, the weekly sections in Life &amp; Times are:

* Monday: &quot;Bots&quot;
* Tuesday: &quot;Heal&quot;
* Wednesday: &quot;Flair&quot;
* Thursday: &quot;JOM!&quot;
* Friday: &quot;Groove&quot;
* Saturday: &quot;Pulse&quot; (As of 13 July 2019, the pullout has been discontinued)
* Sunday: &quot;Vibes&quot;

===&quot;School Times&quot;===

Previously known as Niexter, &quot;School Times&quot; is a supplement targeted at school students. It is published every Tuesday.

An earlier iteration of the supplement was published every Thursday starting in January 2009 and ceased in January 2014. Previously, NST has also used Berita Harian&#x27;s education supplement and their own, such as Primary Plus (Tuesday) and The Next Step (Wednesday) for primary and secondary schools, respectively, between 2001 and 2004.

===&quot;Cars, Bikes &amp; Trucks&quot;===

&quot;Cars, Bikes &amp; Trucks&quot; is the motoring pullout from the &quot;New Sunday Times&quot;. It aims to provide comprehensive details and reviews on almost every car on offer in Malaysia and written by some of the country&#x27;s leading automotive journalists.

== Comics ==
Lat is a long-time cartoonist for the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, producing current, topical comics for &quot;Scenes of Malaysian Life&quot;.

Following Lat&#x27;s retirement, cartoonist Irwan A. Rahman has taken up the mantle of producing the paper&#x27;s editorial cartoon, Wantoon Weekly, which is published every Monday.

== Political control and controversy ==
Owing to political sensitivities, newspapers from Malaysia cannot be sold in Singapore, hence the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; is not sold in Singapore, and &quot;The Straits Times&quot; is not sold in Malaysia. The ban was imposed before 1 May 1969 general election in Malaysia.

In 2012, Senator Nick Xenophon, an independent member of the Australian Parliament, was on a fact-finding mission to Malaysia when he was caught up in anti-government protests in Kuala Lumpur. Subsequently, on 2 May 2012, the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; published an article written by Roy See Wei Zhi and headed &quot;Observer Under Scrutiny&quot;. The report quoted a 2009 speech made by Xenophon and turned it into an attack on Islam, ostensibly to pit Malay-Muslim opinion against the senator, who was a known associate of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. In reality, the speech had been an attack on Scientology and is recorded as such in the Hansard of the Australian Senate. Xenophon threatened to sue the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; for defamation and the newspaper quickly removed the offending article from its website.

The gaffe sparked media outrage in both Malaysia and Australia, and has greatly reinforced public perception that the New Straits Times and most mainstream media merely serve as propaganda mouthpieces for the ruling Barisan Nasional. As of 4 May 2012, Senator Xenophon has confirmed that he would sue the newspaper in spite of their apology.

Following Pakatan Harapan&#x27;s victory in the 14th General Election in May 2018, the newspaper has adopted a more neutral approach in its editorial direction. It aims to promote the mainstream print media by giving fair space to unreported and underreported stories, and not only political ones that are sometimes, according to NST itself, &quot;taking us nowhere&quot;.

== Awards ==
The newspaper took home 3 awards at the 2016 WAN-IFRA Asian Media Awards event, and another 3 at the same event in 2018.

<doc id="410957" wikidata="Q15088252" url="?curid=410957" title="Montreal melon">
<text>The Montreal melon, also known as the Montreal market muskmelon or the Montreal nutmeg melon (), is a type of melon traditionally grown in the area around Montreal, Canada. It was popularised by the seed merchant W. Atlee Burpee starting in 1881 but later disappeared from large-scale cultivation. It was rediscovered in 1996 in a seed bank in Iowa.

==Description==
The fruit is netted like a North American cantaloupe and deeply ribbed like a European cantaloupe. Its flesh is light green, almost melting in the mouth when eaten. Its spicy flavour is reminiscent of nutmeg. During its heyday, it was larger than any other melon cultivated on the continent. &quot;The fruit is of the largest size, specimens often weighing twenty pounds and upward. The shape of this melon is almost round, flattened at both ends, and deeply ribbed, skin green and netted, flesh very thick and of finest flavour.&quot;

A report dated 1909 states that the Montreal melon is difficult to grow and varies greatly in size. &quot;One weighing 44 pounds has been grown. The writer saw one weighing 22 pounds, which had been selected for seed purposes. Their average weight ranges from 8 to 15 pounds... The larger melons are apt to be poorer in quality than those weighing 8 to 15 pounds.&quot;

==History==
The Montreal melon was originally widely grown between the St. Lawrence River and Mount Royal, on the Montreal Plain. In its prime, from the late 19th century until World War II, it was one of the most popular varieties of melon on the east coast of North America.

American newspaper reports show that the melon was also grown in Vermont in the early 20th century and was found to be &quot;exceedingly profitable&quot; for farmers. One article lists the melons selling for about $10/dozen at wholesale and from $1.25 to $1.75 each at retail in 1907.

The melon disappeared as Montreal grew. Its delicate rind, suitable for family farms, was ill-suited to agribusiness. But after about 40 years, it was rediscovered in a seed bank maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Ames, Iowa, in 1996, and has since enjoyed a renaissance among Montreal-area gardeners.

<doc id="410958" wikidata="Q970478" url="?curid=410958" title="Jeff Miller (Florida politician)">
<text>Jefferson Bingham Miller (born June 27, 1959) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2017. A member of the Republican Party, his district included all of Escambia County, Santa Rosa County, Okaloosa County, Walton County, Holmes County and Washington County.

==Early life, education, and career==
Miller was born in St. Petersburg, Florida. After graduating from Bronson High School in 1977, he served for one year under the National FFA Organization as Florida state secretary. Miller went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in journalism from the University of Florida in 1984. He was a real estate broker and a deputy sheriff before taking public office.

==Personal life==

Miller lives in the small town of Chumuckla, Florida (Native American word for &quot;Healing Waters&quot;), which is located about 20 miles northeast of Pensacola, Florida. He and his wife Vicki have two children and four grandchildren and were members of Olive Baptist Church.

==Florida legislature==
Miller was an executive assistant to Democratic state Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner from 1984 to 1988. He was a Democrat until he switched parties in 1997.

Miller was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from November 3, 1998, to October 16, 2001. During his three years there, he was a member of the committees on Utilities &amp; Telecommunications, Congressional Redistricting, Council for Ready Infrastructure, and Rules, Ethics &amp; Elections. During his second term in the state house, Miller was chairman of the Utilities of Telecommunications Committee. He also oversaw a board in charge of community development in Escambia County.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
After Republican incumbent Joe Scarborough resigned five months into his fourth term, Miller won a crowded six-way special Republican primary with 54 percent of the vote. By this time, the 1st had become the most Republican district in Florida, and one of the most Republican districts in the South. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Miller assured himself of becoming the district&#x27;s next congressman with his primary victory. He won the special election with 66 percent of the vote. He won a full term in 2002 with 75 percent of the vote, and was reelected six more times with only nominal opposition, never dropping below 69 percent of the vote. He didn&#x27;t face a major-party challenger in 2006 or 2010.

Miller announced on March 10, 2016, that he would not seek reelection during the 2016 elections.

==Legislation sponsored==
This is a partial list of legislation sponsored by Miller.
* To establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs – a bill that would create a task force to address the issue of a large backlog of veterans disability claims.
* TSA Loose Change Act (H.R. 1095; 113th Congress) – a bill that would force the Transportation Security Administration to give the money left behind by passengers at TSA checkpoints to private charities that provide travel-related services to the members of the U.S. military and their families. Miller introduced the bill on March 12, 2013.
* GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act of 2013 (H.R. 357; 113th Congress) – a bill that would require states to offer veterans the in-state tuition price instead of the out-of-state tuition price regardless of whether the veteran met the residency requirement. The bill would also make other changes to veterans&#x27; benefits. The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 3, 2014.
* Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031; 113th Congress) – a bill that would give the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to remove or demote any individual from the Senior Executive Service upon determining that such individual&#x27;s performance warrants removal or demotion. The bill was written in response to a scandal indicating that some VA hospitals were keeping secret waiting lists for care, the length of which may have led to the deaths of some veterans.
* Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 4810; 113th Congress) – a bill that would allow United States veterans to receive their healthcare from non-VA facilities under certain conditions. The bill is a response to the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014, in which it was discovered that there was systematic lying about the wait times veterans experienced waiting to be seen by doctors. By June 5, 2014, Veterans Affairs internal investigations had identified a total of 35 veterans who had died while waiting for care in the Phoenix VHA system. Miller said that the wait times veterans were forced to face was &quot;a national disgrace.&quot;

He served the district from the January 17, 1989 to November 3, 1992 and the 11th district from November 3, 1992 to November 5, 1996. He retired from the House, to run for Congress.

==Political positions==

===Drug War===
*On September 25, 2001, Boyd voted for HR 2586, an amendment to set up a task force on counter-terrorism and drug interdiction and allow military personnel to help patrol U.S. borders.
*On June 10, 2008, he voted for the Mérida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act, providing funding for Mexico to spend on drug prohibition related contracts. Opponents at the time complained this would increase the availability of military trained hit men to the drug cartels.

===Iraq War===
*On October 10, 2002, Allen Boyd was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

===2008 financial crisis===
* On October 3, 2008, Boyd voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He later voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

===Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill===
* In April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulted from an explosion on a drilling platform, killing 11 workers and leaking millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. On May 5, 2010, Boyd introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives that would raise the liability cap on economic damages in oil spills from $75 million to $10 billion. The legislation would alter the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which was passed after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and requires companies to pay for all cleanup costs of spills but only up to $75 million in economic damages.
* On June 14, Boyd held the Joint Oil Spill-Hurricane Planning conference at Florida State University&#x27;s, Panama City campus to examine the potential threat of a Gulf of Mexico hurricane colliding with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Federal and state emergency response agencies, representatives from the Coast Guard, Air Force and Navy, and members of the local tourism industry all participated in the day-long event.
* On June 11, Boyd sent a letter to the President of the United States, asking him to create a Gulf seafood safety task force to counter growing public perception that all seafood harvested in the Gulf of Mexico is contaminated by oil.

==Political campaigns==

===1996–2008===
Boyd entered the 1996 Democratic primary for the 2nd in 1996, after three-term Democratic incumbent Pete Peterson announced his retirement. He led a three-way Democratic primary with 48 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes short of outright victory. He then won the runoff with 64 percent of the vote and easily won the election in November. He was reelected with no major-party opposition in 1998 and defeated an underfunded Republican in 2000.

In 2002, however, the Republican-controlled state legislature significantly altered Boyd&#x27;s district. Part of heavily Democratic Tallahassee, which has anchored the district since its formation in 1963 (as the 9th District; it was renumbered the 2nd in 1967) was shifted to the Jacksonville-based 3rd District. In its place, heavily Republican Panama City was shifted from the Pensacola-based 1st District to the 2nd. On paper, this made the district considerably friendlier to Republicans; Al Gore narrowly won the old 2nd in 2000, but George W. Bush would have narrowly won the district under its current boundaries. However, Boyd was handily reelected with 66 percent of the vote in 2002 against another underfunded Republican. In 2004, Boyd faced his first serious test in the form of state representative Bev Kilmer, but Boyd turned back this challenge fairly easily, taking 62 percent of the vote even as George W. Bush carried the district with 54 percent of the vote. Boyd was unopposed for reelection in 2006 and defeated a nominal Republican challenger in 2008.

===2010===

In 2010, Boyd fended off a spirited challenge in the primary from a more liberal Democrat, State Senator Al Lawson, with whom he&#x27;d served in the state house. In the general election, Boyd was defeated by Republican nominee Steve Southerland in the 2010 election, taking only 41 percent of the vote. Independent candidates Paul C. McKain and Dianne Berryhill were also on the ballot; Ray Netherwood qualified as a write-in candidate.

== Farming career ==
Boyd is a fifth-generation farmer from Monticello, Florida and is the majority owner of Boyd Family Farms Inc. Boyd has received almost $1.3 million in federal farm subsidies since 1996, placing him in the top 3 percent of farmers receiving subsidies nationally, and 12th among more than 5,300 farms in his district that received subsidy money over this period.

==Personal life==
Boyd is married to Jeannie Schmoe and has 3 grown children (2 sons and 1 daughter) from his previous marriage to Cissy Roush. His son John was imprisoned in 2008 for transporting illegal narcotics and illegal aliens into the United States from Mexico.

<doc id="410965" wikidata="Q973548" url="?curid=410965" title="Clown triggerfish">
<text>The clown triggerfish (Balistoides conspicillum), also known as the bigspotted triggerfish, is a demersal marine fish.

This fish belongs to the order Tetraodontiformes, which includes pufferfish. Tetraodontiformes are typically found in temperate seas around the world. Fish that belong to this order usually have small temperate mouths.

The family, Balistidae, which is commonly called triggerfish. Currently there are about 37 Balistidae species. This family of fish are very different than other Tetraodontiformes. Unlike the other Tetraodontiformes, their body shape is compressed, with easy to spot scales. Triggerfish have not comprehensively been reviewed enough to have a complete description of them. 

==Description==

Because of its coloration, the clown triggerfish is highly prized as an aquarium fish.

The clown triggerfish is a fish which grows up to 50 cm (19.7 inches) in the wild, however, in captivity it does not usually reach that length. This is considered a large fish. Its body has a stocky appearance, oval shape and compressed laterally. The head is large and represents approximately one third of the body length. The mouth is small, terminal and has strong teeth.

The clown triggerfish is closely related to two other species: the black triggerfish (Melichthys) and the pineapple triggerfish (Pseudobalistes Flavimarginatus).  Due to the large white spots on the ventral side, the clown triggerfish is harder to mistaken for other species.

The first dorsal fin is composed of three spines, one of which is longer and stronger. It is erectile and hidden in a dorsal furrow. This set of dorsal spines composed a trigger system which is a characteristic from the family Balistidae. The second dorsal fin is similar in shape and size to the anal fin which is symmetrically opposed to it. The pelvic fin is reduced to a ventral protrusion.

The background coloration is black. Half of inferior part of the body is marked with big white spots which are more or less round. The area around the first dorsal fin is crossed by yellowish sinuosities which draw like a network reminding the leopard&#x27;s patterns. There is a yellowish ring around the mouth, which is surrounded by another fin white ring. A white stripe ride the snout just under the eyes level. The second dorsal fin and the anal fin are white and underlined with a yellow line at their base. The caudal peduncle has a yellowish blotch on its top part and has three horizontal sets of spiny scales. The caudal fin is yellowish in its center and has black margin. Juveniles have a black background coloration spangled with small white spots, the extremity of the snout and the base of the first dorsal fin is yellowish. 

The coloration of this fish can play tricks on other fish. For example, the white spots on the ventral side of the fish can be confused, by other fish, with the light rays in the water.

The clown triggerfish’s scales are round and weaker than that of other fish. These scales have two layers: the topmost layer being bone and the lower layer being collagenous.

This fish has teeth that continuously grow. These teeth help them when feeding on crustaceans.

==Distribution and habitat==
The clown triggerfish is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean and in the western Pacific Ocean. These fish typically like being around similarly colored areas such as reefs and coral reefs that have steep drop offs nearby. These environments provide suitable habitats for them, including mating and hiding.

A single record was reported in the Mediterranean Sea in Spanish waters in 2012, a likely aquarium release. It is most commonly found along external reef slopes with clear water until 75 m depth. Juveniles are usually staying below 20 m sheltered close to caves or overhangs.

The clown triggerfish has also been documented in the Israeli Red Sea. This was also most likely due to an aquarium release.

== Biology ==
The clown triggerfish have also been known to reproduce slowly even though they are found all around different reefs. These fish create harems after reaching one year of age. Though they are able to live up to 20 years, but reach sexual maturity at about one year.

The female lays her eggs while the male fertilizes them in sandy patches. From here, the parents will defend the nest, for about eight days, until the eggs hatch. Which is when the female starts to care for them. Typically, clown triggerfish spawn in deep water, which is where the young stay until they grow close to 20cm. This is where the steep drop offs near the reefs comes in handy for the clown triggerfish. 

The clown triggerfish can be found in many different oceans, however they can be seldom found in their natural habitats. It is unclear if this species is a rare find or if it’s abundant and just not well documented.

This fish has acrocentric chromosomes, which is pretty common amongst many fish species.

==Feeding==
&quot;Balistoides conspicillum&quot; has a varied diet based on different benthic organisms like molluscs, echinoderms and crustaceans. The clown triggerfish has powerful jaws that are typically used during aggressive actions with smaller fish. Due to their strength, this fish is capable of crushing sea urchins and other crustaceans. They have also been seen attacking and consuming crinoids more so than the average reef fish.

==Behaviour==
This triggerfish has a diurnal activity, is solitary and defends a territory. It can be hard to find this fish in its habitat. It can be very aggressive with other fish and congeners.The clown triggerfish can be sociable the younger it is, however as it gets older, the less sociable and more aggressive it becomes. The first long dorsal spine when is erected, it is used to impress an opponent or to avoid a predator to pull it out of its refuge.

The clown triggerfish does not enter, or rarely enter other triggerfish’s territories. These fish have also not shown aggression towards other triggerfish, only other species of fish.

When the clown triggerfish is in danger it hides in holes. It is capable of locking the spine on their dorsal fin in place, while also locking their smaller dorsal and ventral fin in place. This makes it harder for the fish to be pulled out of their hiding hole.

==In aquariums==
The clown triggerfish is a common fish found in aquariums and public zoos, since their coloration and pattern is very unique. These fish have been recorded as being difficult to handle, as they’re pretty aggressive, but not as difficult as other species can be. 

The juvenile clown triggerfish are sought out after more than adults since juveniles are less aggressive towards other fish. Like many other triggerfish, it can require a large aquarium and be aggressive towards other fish. It should not be kept with small fish. Clown triggerfish can be housed with other large fish species such as moray eels and angelfish, but they thrive when kept alone. It will also prey on invertebrates in the aquarium. This fish can become tame enough to be hand-fed; however, one should beware of the fish&#x27;s sharp teeth. They have been known to take out chunks of flesh while being hand-fed. 

Decor in their tanks must be tough, as clown triggerfish will attack them.

Due to the high demand of the clown triggerfish, people tend to capture them in the wild. This can lead to local populations being impacted.

The clown triggerfish, or any triggerfish should not be one of the first fish added to an aquarium. They should be one of the last ones, if not the last fish added as they will most likely not see their tank mates as potential food sources. Any fish or crustaceans added after the triggerfish is added is seen as food and usually attacked quickly.

== Conservation Status ==
The clown trigger fish is of least concern, however, this fish has been introduced into different ecosystems in different parts of the world. One place in particular is the Israeli Red Sea, in which the clown triggerfish was introduced, most likely intentionally, by a private aquarium keeper. This sea has a fragile ecosystem that has been under a lot of stress. One of the bigger concerns is that the clown triggerfish that have been released into the wild may contain harmful bacteria. Aquarium fish that were from farms often contain harmful bacteria that can decimate aquariums if not treated quickly and properly. For wild fish, coming into contact with farmed fish can be devastating as wild fish would not have any barriers against the harmful bacteria.

Since the clown triggerfish is a highly sought after aquarium fish, being taken straight from the reefs causes problems. Reefs contain coral which are highly sensitive animals. Divers will disturb and destroy  the reefs upon capturing a clown triggerfish which can have devastating consequences on the reefs in those areas, especially towards other reef fish. The clown triggerfish relies on coral reefs for food and shelter, but with the decline in coral reefs, there may be a possibility of a decline in clown triggerfish population in the future.

Due to the clown triggerfish most likely being introduced by an aquarium, there could be potentially harmful effects, though the effects have not fully been recorded. It is likely that the introduced fish have not survived, however certain reefs have enough plasticity to include the clown triggerfish.

<text>A mechanical desk is usually an antique desk type which was produced during the 18th or the 19th century. At one extreme there are desks furnished with a multitude of panels that swing out while stacks of small drawers pop up when a user lowers or extracts the main writing surface or desktop from a closed position, thanks to some well placed levers and gears. At the other extreme are mechanically simple desks like the Wooton desk whose two panels open up separately by hand and whose desktop is also opened in a separate manual operation, without exploiting any gears or levers. The term is used quite loosely.

There was an explosion of mechanical desk designs in the second part of the 18th century. This came at the same time as a renewed interest in smaller domestic furniture in the homes of the rich, and the general introduction in their homes of all kinds of new mechanical devices such as small clocks and wood turning tools. These devices are described in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of 1772. The devices and the interest in them were a result of the technological ferment which arose in the United Kingdom during its Industrial Revolution, and gradually spread to Europe.

The mechanical desk fad gradually died at the beginning of the 19th century. By the middle of the 19th century desk mechanisms were mostly simple affairs meant to extract or retract sliders or supports from a secretary desk, to give but one example. Sit-stand desks, however, became popular again in the 21st century.

<doc id="410969" wikidata="Q461512" url="?curid=410969" title="Corrine Brown">
<text>Corrine Brown (born November 11, 1946) is an American former politician and convicted felon who served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida from 1993 to 2017. She is a member of the Democratic Party. After a court-ordered redistricting significantly changed her district and a federal felony conviction for corruption, Brown was defeated in the 2016 Democratic primary by Al Lawson, who went on to win Brown&#x27;s former seat.

On December 4, 2017, she was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay restitution for fraud. Her conviction was later overturned on appeal and the court ordered she be retried on the charges. On May 17, 2022, she pleaded guilty on the charges to avoid a second trial. Former Congresswoman Brown was sentenced to the time that she had already served in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, specifically two years, eight months, and nine days. Brown was also ordered to pay $62,650.99 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Brown earned a bachelor of science degree from Florida A&amp;M University in 1969 She earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1971 from Florida A&amp;M University, and in 1974 received an educational specialist degree from the University of Florida.

==Florida legislature==
After an unsuccessful bid for the Florida House of Representatives in 1980, Brown was elected two years later from a newly drawn House district and served in the House for ten years.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
====1992–2008====
After the 1990 census, the Florida legislature carved out a new 3rd congressional district in the northern part of the state. This district was designed to enclose an African-American majority within its boundaries. A horseshoe-shaped district encompassing largely African-American neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Gainesville, Orlando, Ocala, and Lake City, the 3rd district seemed likely to send Florida&#x27;s first African-American to Congress since Reconstruction, and Brown decided to run.

Brown faced several candidates in the 1992 Democratic primary, but the strongest opponent to emerge was Andy Johnson, a white talk radio host from Jacksonville. Brown defeated Johnson in the primary and in a two-candidate runoff, and went on to win the general election in November 1992.

In 1995, the 3rd district was struck down by the United States Supreme Court as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. One of the main instigators of the lawsuit that led to the redistricting was Brown&#x27;s 1992 opponent, Andy Johnson. Brown railed against the change, complaining that &quot;[t]he Bubba I beat couldn&#x27;t win at the ballot box [so] he took it to court,&quot; in an interview with &quot;New Republic&quot;. Although the district was redrawn to be more compact and its black population decreased, Brown won reelection in 1996.

====2010====
On June 1, 2009, Brown announced she would form an exploratory committee for a possible run for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Mel Martinez saying, &quot;These are challenging times for Florida. Our economy is in a shambles and our families are hurting. Charlie Crist may be good at taking pictures and making promises, but what has he actually accomplished?&quot; In October 2009, it was announced that Brown would not run for Senate, and would seek reelection in the House of Representatives.

====2012–2016====

After decennial redistricting in 2012, Brown&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 5th district, but its basic shape remained the same, stretching from Jacksonville to Orlando. It was identified as one of the most gerrymandered districts in the country. The League of Women Voters of Florida and the Florida Democratic Party challenged the new redistricting plan in court, claiming that the new 5th district was drawn to favor its incumbent and the Republican Party by packing Democratic voters, in violation of the newly adopted Fair Districts Amendment.

In 2015, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the congressional redistricting plan was a partisan gerrymander in violation of the Fair Districts Amendment, and ordered the 5th district to be substantially redrawn. Brown challenged the new court-ordered map in federal court, arguing that the new plan violated the federal Voting Rights Act. In April 2016, the court ruled against Brown. The configuration approved by the Supreme Court made the new 5th district significantly more compact than its predecessor. It changed to an east-west direction along the Georgia border from downtown Jacksonville to Tallahassee.

Brown ran for reelection in 2016, even though she now found herself in a district that was over 62 percent new to her. After being indicted by a federal grand jury and facing trial on 22 federal felony criminal counts, Brown was defeated in the Democratic primary by former state senator Al Lawson of Tallahassee, who went on to win in November.

==== 2022 ====
In June 2022, Brown announced she would seek the Democratic nomination for a House seat given up by Val Demings, who had chosen to run for the Senate. She finished a distant fourth in a field that included, among others, the winner Maxwell Frost, Florida Senator Randolph Bracy, and former U.S. Representative Alan Grayson.

===Tenure===

In 2006, she voted &quot;no&quot; on the Child Custody Protection Act, Public Expression of Religion Act, Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act, Military Commissions Act, and Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 2006. She voted &quot;yes&quot; on the SAFE Port Act. On September 29, 2008, Brown voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

====Interest group ratings====
In terms of interest group ratings, Brown held high percentages in pro-choice groups such as the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates – Positions on Reproductive Rights (for which she has a 100% rating), NARAL Pro-Choice America – Positions (100%), National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association – House of Representatives Score (100%). Brown overall held high percentage rates from other issue groups involving animal and wildlife issues, senior and security issues, labor, education, and welfare and poverty. Meanwhile, Brown&#x27;s ratings were lower in issues that deal with agriculture and economics such as National Taxpayers Union – Positions on Tax and Spending (5%), American Farm Bureau Federation – Positions (33%), and United States Chamber of Commerce – Positions (13%). Other relatively low rates for Brown from interest groups include trade, conservative issues, national security, indigenous peoples issues, gun issues, immigration, and foreign aid and policy issues. The ratings do not necessarily correlate with Brown&#x27;s positions or votes on certain issues during her time as a representative in the House.

===Political controversies===
National Baptist Convention check&lt;br&gt;In 1998, Brown was questioned by the House Ethics Committee about receiving a $10,000 check from National Baptist Convention leader and long-time associate, Henry Lyons. Brown confirmed receiving the check and denied she had used the money improperly. Brown said that she had taken the check and converted it into another check made out to Pameron Bus Tours to pay for transportation to a rally she organized in Tallahassee. She said that she didn&#x27;t have to report the money, and that she had been cleared, explaining the rally was to protest the reorganization of her district lines, and she did not use it for herself.

====Forgery====
The Federal Election Commission admonished Brown and Brown&#x27;s former campaign treasurer quit after he discovered that his name had been forged on her campaign reports. The staffer alleged to have forged the treasurer&#x27;s signature stayed with Brown and as of 1998 was her chief of staff.

====Congressional Accountability Project====
On June 9, 1998, the Congressional Accountability Project voted to conduct a formal inquiry regarding Brown. The Project called for the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to determine whether Brown had violated House ethics rules. One of the complaints was that Brown&#x27;s adult daughter, Shantrel Brown, had received a luxury automobile as a gift from an agent of a Malian swindler and millionaire named Foutanga Babani Sissoko. Sissoko, a friend of Congresswoman Brown, had been imprisoned in Miami after pleading guilty to charges of bribing a customs officer. Brown had worked to secure his release, pressuring U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to deport Sissoko back to his homeland as an alternative to continued incarceration. The Project held this violated the House gift rule, but Brown denied she had acted improperly. The congressional subcommittee investigating Brown found insufficient evidence to issue a Statement of Alleged Violation, but said she had acted with poor judgment in connection with Sissoko.

====2000 presidential election====
Brown and other members of the House of Representatives objected to counting the 25 electoral votes from Florida which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election.

In July 2004, Brown was rebuked by the House of Representatives after she referred to the disputed 2000 presidential election in Florida as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. This comment came during floor debate over HR 4818, which would have provided for international monitoring of the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

====2004 presidential election====
Brown was one of the 31 representatives who voted against counting the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 United States presidential election. President George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Campaign finances===
During her 2009–2010 campaign, Brown raised up to $966,669 from fundraising. Brown&#x27;s top contributors included CSX Corporation, a railroad-based freight transportation company with its headquarters in Jacksonville; Carnival Corporation, cruise line operator; Picerne Real Estate Group; Union Pacific Corp and Berkshire Hathaway, which owns BNSF Railway. Brown&#x27;s top industry contributors included those railroads, lawyers/farm firms, real estate, transportation unions, and sea transportation. Top sectors in Brown&#x27;s 2009–2010 campaign included transportation, lawyers and lobbyists, labor, construction, and finance/insurance/real estate. During her campaign, the largest source of funds was given by large individual companies, which accounted for 54% of the contributions, and PAC contributions, which accounted for 36%. Sources of funds also included small individual contributions, self-financing on Brown&#x27;s part and other sources.

==Felony fraud conviction==
In July 2016, Brown and her chief of staff, Elias &quot;Ronnie&quot; Simmons, pleaded not guilty to a 22 count federal indictment in relation to a non-profit charity, One Door for Education Foundation. The indictment included charges of participating in a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, multiple counts of mail and wire fraud, concealing material facts on required financial disclosure forms, theft of government property, obstruction of the Internal Revenue Service laws, and filing false tax returns.

Federal prosecutors allege the charity was to give scholarships to underprivileged students, but instead acted as the personal slush fund for Brown and her associates. The indictment said that Brown and Simmons &quot;filled the coffers of Brown and her associates&quot; with One Door donations for their personal and professional benefit, totaling $800,000, much of which was deposited in cash to Brown&#x27;s personal bank accounts.

On May 11, 2017, Brown was convicted on 18 of 22 corruption charges ranging from mail fraud to filing a false federal tax return. and on December 4, 2017, she was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay restitution. She reported on January 29, 2018 to Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Sumter County, Florida, near Wildwood, to begin her sentence. She appealed her conviction, and collected her Congressional pension until her appeal concluded. Subsequently, Brown lost her appeal on January 10, 2020.

===Conviction overturned ===
On May 6, 2021, the en banc 11th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Brown&#x27;s conviction, ruling in a 7-4 decision that a juror had been improperly removed by the trial judge, Timothy J. Corrigan, because the juror had claimed the Holy Spirit had spoken to him. The court&#x27;s opinion remanded the case back to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida for a new trial. The Justice Department could have appealed the Circuit Court&#x27;s decision to the United States Supreme Court. In January 2022, a retrial was scheduled for September 2022.

Brown was released from prison on April 22, 2020 citing health concerns. Her attorney argued she was at increased risk of COVID-19 because of her age and underlying health conditions.

===New guilty plea===
On May 17, 2022, Brown chose to avoid a new trial by pleading guilty to the charge of &quot;interference with the due administration of Internal Revenue Service laws.&quot;

<doc id="410971" wikidata="Q1974717" url="?curid=410971" title="Black triggerfish">
<text>The black triggerfishor black durgon(&quot;Melichthys niger&quot;), called Humuhumu&#x27;ele&#x27;ele in Hawaiian, is a blimp-shaped triggerfish with bright white lines running along its dorsal and anal fins. From distance, it appears to be completely black. However, upon closer inspection with good lighting, one can see that it is actually mottled dark-blue/green coloration often with orange toward the front of the head. Black durgons are capable of changing color based on their surroundings.

These are not to be confused with their cousins, the Indian triggerfish or black-finned triggerfish (&quot;Melichthys indicus&quot;), which are often mistaken as being black triggerfish within the aquarium trade. The Indian triggerfish has never been found near Hawaii, but bears a striking resemblance to the black triggerfish because of the similar shape and coloration.

==Range==
Circumtropical. Hawaii, up through Polynesia, westward to the East Indies and across the Indian Ocean. The black triggerfish is also located around the southern coast of Africa.
Although, the black triggerfish is commonly found in the Indo Pacific and Red Sea.

==Habitat==

This species is found in open waters, shallows, and exposed reefs, 5–35 metres (15–115 feet) Seems to prefer inland/shores in the Ascension Island region where they are strangely prolific.

==Size==
On average, 12 inches, although it can grow to be up to 18 inches.

==Diet==
Omnivorous. Feeds upon small fish and squid. Shrimp, zooplankton, algae, and other marine plant life.

A study conducted in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago of the southwest Atlantic Ocean, revealed the feces and vomit of Spinner dolphins (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;) formed part of the diet of twelve species of reef fish from seven different families. The most prolific consumer was the black male, which could even discern the postures dolphins assumed prior to voiding and positioned themselves for effective feeding. All these offal eating fish species are recorded plankton eaters and it is considered that this type of feeding may represent a change in its usual diet, i.e. drifting plankton.

On September 29, 2008, Crenshaw voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Assets Relief Program. He was one of only three Florida Republicans to do so.

Despite his support of the bill, he issued a press release to &quot;applaud the organizers and participants&quot; of the April 15, 2009, First Coast Tax Day Tea Party in Jacksonville, one of the many 2009 Tea Party protests which condemned any bailouts.

On July 2, 2014, Crenshaw introduced the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 5016; 113th Congress), an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015 that would provide funding for the United States Department of the Treasury, as we all as the United States federal courts, the Executive Office of the President of the United States, and Washington, D.C.

In 2000, Crenshaw returned to politics when he won the Republican nomination for the 4th District after Tillie Fowler retired to honor a self-imposed four-term limit.

<text>The Swan of Tuonela () is an 1895 tone poem by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. It is part of the &quot; (Four Legends from the Kalevala)&quot;, Op. 22, based on the Finnish mythological epic the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

&quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; was originally composed in 1893 as the prelude to a projected opera called &quot;The Building of the Boat&quot;. Sibelius revised it two years later, making it the second section of his &quot;&quot; of four tone poems, which was premiered in 1896. He twice further revised the piece, in 1897 and 1900. Sibelius left posterity no personal account of his writing of the tone poem, and its original manuscript no longer exists (the date of its disappearance is unknown). The work was first published by K. F. Wasenius in Helsingfors (Helsinki), Finland, in April 1901. The German firm Breitkopf &amp; Härtel also published it in Leipzig, also in 1901. The work was recorded for the first time by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra in May 1929. 

== Structure ==
The tone poem is scored for a small orchestra of cor anglais, oboe, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trombones, timpani, bass drum, harp, and divided strings. The cor anglais is the voice of the swan, and its solo is one of the best known solos in the orchestral literature for that instrument. The music paints a gossamer, transcendental image of a mystical swan floating through Tuonela, the realm of the dead. , the hero of the epic, has been tasked with killing the sacred swan, but on the way he is shot with a poisoned arrow and dies. In the next part of the story he is restored to life.

<text>Virginia Brown-Waite (born Virginia Frances Kniffen; October 5, 1943) is an American politician who served as U.S. Representative for from 2003 until 2011. She is a member of the Republican Party and a founder of Maggie&#x27;s List.

The district stretched along several counties in western and central Florida, including territory in the metropolitan area of Tampa Bay.

==Early life, education, and career==
Virginia Frances Kniffen was born in Albany, New York, on October 5, 1943. She attended Albany’s Vincentian High School. In 1976, she graduated from Empire State College, State University of New York (Northeast Center) with a BS in Interdisciplinary Studies. She was the first member of her family to earn a college degree. She later earned a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Russell Sage College.

She served as a staffer in the New York State Senate, working there for 17 years and eventually rising to the role of legislative director. During this time, she divorced her first husband and married Harvey Waite, a New York state trooper. After Harvey Waite’s retirement in the mid-1980s, they moved to Brooksville, Florida.

==Florida Legislature==
She first became involved in local politics in 1990, winning election as a county commissioner in Hernando County, Florida, serving one term from 1991 to 1993. In November 1992, Brown-Waite defeated a 24-year incumbent and was elected to the Florida State Senate as a Republican. She served three terms, moving up the ranks to serve as Senate Majority Whip from 1999 to 2000, and as president pro tempore of the state senate from 2001 to 2002.

Brown-Waite expressed support for the death penalty. She says she believed she saw &quot;a message&quot; in a nosebleed suffered by death row inmate Allen Lee Davis during his execution on July 8, 1999. Brown-Waite, who saw in the blood the shape of a cross, believes that it either indicated Davis had made peace with God, or it was a message from God giving his blessing to the execution.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Health
** Subcommittee on Social Security

===Caucus memberships===
* Co-Chair of the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus

===Tenure===
Since entering Congress, Brown-Waite has garnered a lifetime rating of 90 from the American Conservative Union. However, she broke with her party on a few occasions. She criticized George W. Bush for fielding questions from hand-picked crowds. &quot;Let me tell you the difference between a GWB town-hall meeting – George W. Bush – and a GBW – Ginny Brown-Waite – town-hall meeting: I don&#x27;t load the audience with just the choir,&quot; she once said. She was one of five Republicans who voted against a bill to give Terri Schiavo&#x27;s parents the right to sue in federal court to keep her alive (Schiavo&#x27;s home was located in the 5th). She is a member of Republican groups such as Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s It&#x27;s My Party Too, Mike Castle&#x27;s Republican Main Street Partnership, and The Wish List.

Brown-Waite&#x27;s district has one of the highest concentrations of retirees in the country. In early 2005, she referred to the current Social Security system as a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;. However, she was skeptical of the president&#x27;s proposal for personal accounts, saying that he hadn&#x27;t done a good job of selling it to seniors.

On April 6, 2005, Brown-Waite introduced the Jessica Lunsford Act, named for Jessica Lunsford, a nine-year-old from her district who was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in Homosassa, Florida, by John Couey. The bill, modeled after the Florida law of the same name, had the objectives to punish sex offenders and reduce their ability to re-offend. It had 107 cosponsors and was referred to a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, but it was never voted upon (either by any committee or the full Congress), and it died when the 109th Congress finally adjourned.

On Iraq, after reports that Brown-Waite supports the withdrawal of U.S. troops within a year, her spokesman said in an e-mail that &quot;it was taken out of context&quot; and that &quot;she said that if the Iraqis did not work toward troop and police deadlines, then Congress would put pressure on them to do so with the threat of denying funds for reconstruction and possibly withdrawing some troops.&quot; He also said that Brown-Waite would support &quot;a properly-worded resolution&quot; that would put forth a no-confidence vote in Congress for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (who resigned in 2007).

Brown-Waite voted against an amendment that would have cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and other family planning organizations.

Brown-Waite is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, she supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act In 2008, she opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined &quot;unlawful Internet gambling&quot;).

An ardent opponent of gun control, Brown-Waite was known for proudly carrying a gun on trips to her district.
She proposed the American Heroes Repatriation Act, to move American soldiers buried in France and Belgium back to the United States., in the process angering French officials and constituents.

She also caused a minor controversy when, commenting on the economic-stimulus package proposed by President Bush in early 2008, she referred to the peoples of Puerto Rico and Guam as &quot;foreign citizens&quot; (when they are, in fact, American citizens and nationals, respectively). She has since clarified those comments with an article on the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;.

On September 29, 2008, Brown-Waite voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and also voted against the amended version which was enacted.

The House version of the American Recovery and Investment Act was passed on January 28, 2009. Brown-Waite was the only Republican to abstain from voting. All other 177 House Republicans voted against the Act.

===Mark Foley scandal===

In September 2006, Brown-Waite was told about an incident from 2003 or 2004 when an apparently inebriated Mark Foley had tried to gain access to the pages&#x27; dormitory. On September 28, 2006, an inappropriate e-mail that Foley sent was posted on ABCNEWS.com&#x27;s &quot;The Blotter&quot;. Brown-Waite launched her own investigation and alerted Republican leadership on September 29 both about the dorm incident and about pages who had been made to feel uncomfortable by Foley. Foley resigned that day and the scandal erupted that evening with news of the lurid instant messages he had sent former pages.

==Political campaigns==

===2002===
The 5th District had been represented by Democrat Karen Thurman since its formation in 1993. After the 2000 Census, the Republican-controlled Florida legislature redrew the 5th to be more friendly to Republicans. For the most part, the new 5th overlapped Brown-Waite&#x27;s state senate district. Brown-Waite won the Republican primary, then won a narrow victory in November 2002 over Thurman despite the unfavorable publicity that came in October when police caught her husband, former New York state trooper Harvey Waite, stealing pro-Thurman lawn signs.

===2004===
Brown-Waite was re-elected in 2004 with 66% of the vote against attorney Robert Whittell.

===2006===

Brown-Waite was re-elected to a third term in 2006, receiving 59% of the vote against Democrat John Russell.

===2008===

Brown-Waite was re-elected to a fourth term in 2008, receiving 61% of the vote against Democrat John Russell.

Land o&#x27; Lakes Republican Jim King joined the race as a conservative candidate, attacking the moderate Congresswoman from the right on matters of national security, immigration, taxation, and supporting the troops, which is one of Brown-Waite&#x27;s signature issues. He also made an appeal to conservative Christian primary voters. In the first three fundraising quarters, King raised $40,000, an amount dwarfed by the $176,000 Brown-Waite raised during that period, yet still large enough for King&#x27;s campaign to have begun running local radio ads nine month in advance of primary day. Three Democrats declared their candidacies: 2006 nominee John Russell, H. David Werder and Carol Castagnero. Castagnero placed third in the Democratic primary for governor in 2006 and took 40% of the vote against State Senator Paula Dockery in 2004. John Russell was the Democratic nominee in the general election against Ginny Brown-Waite in 2006.

On November 26, 2007, it was reported that after years of hosting town hall meetings on the issue and calling for full hearing on the implications of the FAIR Tax, Brown-Waite had endorsed the FairTax proposal on September 24. King accused her of only changing her stance because of his support for it.

===2010===

On April 30, Brown-Waite announced she would be retiring at the end of her current term. In a statement, she cited long-running health problems, particularly with her pancreas. Brown-Waite endorsed Hernando County sheriff Richard B. Nugent as her successor.

===2012===
Brown-Waite considered running for local office in 2012.

==Notable statements==
February 15, 2007: &quot;Git-R-Done&quot;
During a February 15 floor debate on US participation in Iraq, Brown-Waite invoked Larry the Cable Guy and professed the following: &quot;In the South, we have a wonderful saying and it goes like this: Get ‘er done. Our soldiers want to get it done and come home, and our President wants the same thing, and this Congress should demand the exact same thing. Let’s get out there and get ‘er done.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Naupactus was a naval battle in the Peloponnesian War. The battle, which took place a week after the Athenian victory at Rhium, set an Athenian fleet of twenty ships, commanded by Phormio, against a Peloponnesian fleet of seventy-seven ships, commanded by Cnemus. 

In the battle, the Peloponnesians drew the Athenians out from their anchorage at Antirrhium by sailing into the Gulf of Corinth, moving as if to attack the vital Athenian base at Naupactus. The Athenians were forced to shadow their movements, sailing eastward along the northern shore of the gulf. Attacking suddenly, the Peloponnesians drove nine Athenian ships ashore and pursued the others towards Naupactus; victory seemed securely in their hands. At the entrance to the harbor of Naupactus, however, the last Athenian ship to reach the harbor turned the tide by circling around an anchored merchant ship to ram and sink its leading pursuer. Confusion set in among the Peloponnesians, and the newly emboldened Athenians set out after them and routed them. 

In all, the Athenians recaptured all but one of their nine grounded ships and seized six Peloponnesian ships. This surprising victory preserved Athens&#x27; naval dominance and kept Naupactus secure; the arrival of an additional twenty Athenian ships shortly afterwards secured the victory and put an end to Sparta&#x27;s attempt to take the offensive in the Northwest.

==Prelude==
In 429 BC, the Spartan government had ordered the navarch Cnemus to launch an offensive in the Corinthian gulf and northwestern Greece aimed at knocking several Athenian allies out of the Peloponnesian War. Ideally, the Spartans hoped to capture the Athenian base at Naupactus, from which the Athenians had been harassing Corinthian shipping. That offensive, however, suffered a severe setback when Cnemus was turned back on land by the Acarnanians at Stratus, while a Peloponnesian fleet of forty-seven ships was routed by Phormio&#x27;s twenty ships at Rhium. The Spartan government, dismayed by this unexpected reversal, dispatched several advisors (including the aggressive and talented Brasidas) to oversee Cnemus as he resumed the offensive. Phormio, meanwhile, sent to Athens for reinforcements, and twenty ships were sent out to him; these were ordered to first sail to Crete to attack Cydonia, and as a result did not arrive in time to participate in the battle.

Cnemus and the advisors, combining the ships that Cnemus had taken with him to Stratus with those retreating from Rhium and raising more ships levied from Sparta&#x27;s allies on the gulf, had soon assembled a fleet of seventy-seven ships. The admirals then advanced with this fleet to Panormus, in Achaea, where they met up with the Peloponnesian infantry. Phormio, meanwhile, brought his ships up to Antirrhium, across the strait of Rhium from the Peloponnesians. Here, he was in position to move against the enemy fleet if it attempted to sail west into the open sea; if he allowed it to escape in this way, he would essentially have surrendered Athens&#x27; dominance over the sea, and might well have found himself blockaded in Naupactus.

==Battle==
With the fleets at anchor across the strait from each other, it fell to the Peloponnesians to initiate a battle, as they wished to force an action before the Athenian reinforcements arrived. After six or seven days at Rhium, therefore, the Spartan commanders led their fleet eastward into the Corinthian Gulf. The Athenians, who in the previous battle had been able to take advantage of their superior maneuverability in the open sea, were reluctant to enter the constricted waters of the Gulf, but were forced to follow the Peloponnesians in order to protect Naupactus, which had been left ungarrisoned.

The twenty Athenian ships entered the gulf sailing in single file along the northern shore; the Messenian hoplites from Naupactus marched along the shore beside them. On the southern shore, the Peloponnesian fleet was sailing in four lines, parallel to the shore. On the right of these lines, leading the advance into the gulf, were the twenty best and fastest ships in the fleet, which had been assigned the job of preventing the Athenians from escaping when the Peloponnesians attacked.

Seeing the Athenians in the gulf and sailing in single file, Cnemus gave the signal for his ships to attack. The Peloponnesian fleet turned at once and raced across the gulf at the Athenians. 
The Athenians attempted to flee, but only the eleven leading ships were able to slip around the Peloponnesian right wing and flee towards Naupactus; the remaining nine were cornered, driven ashore, and captured, while the twenty elite Peloponnesian ships from the right wing set out after the fleeing Athenian eleven.

Ten Athenian ships reached Naupactus safely and took up positions at the mouth of the harbor, prows facing outwards, ready to defend against any attempt to enter the harbor. The last Athenian ship was fleeing towards the harbor, with the Peloponnesians (who were already chanting the victory paean) pursuing it closely, when it came alongside a merchant ship anchored outside the harbor. Using the merchant ship to protect its flanks while he turned, the Athenian captain spun his ship 270 degrees and rammed his leading pursuer in the side, sinking it. Although the Peloponnesians still held a great numerical advantage, the shock of this single action, which disheartened the Peloponnesian crews and reinvigorated the Athenians, proved sufficient to turn the tide of the battle. Confusion set in among the Peloponnesians; some rowers in leading ships dropped their oars to allow the main body to catch up with them—thus leaving themselves immobile and vulnerable in the face of an enemy force; other ships ran aground as a result of their captains&#x27; ignorance of the coastline. The ten Athenian ships in the harbor rushed out and joined the attack, and the Peloponnesians were instantly routed. The Athenians captured six ships in the pursuit, and recovered all but one of their own ships which had been taken earlier. Although both sides claimed victory and set up trophies, it was clear who had won the battle; the Peloponnesians, fearing the arrival of the Athenian reinforcements, retreated to Corinth under cover of darkness several days after the battle, and the Athenians continued to hold Naupactus and dominate the gulf.

==Aftermath==
The Athenian victory at Naupactus put an end to Sparta&#x27;s attempt to challenge Athens in the Corinthian gulf and the Northwest, and secured Athens&#x27; dominance at sea. At Naupactus, the Athenians&#x27; backs had been against the wall; a defeat there would have lost Athens its foothold in the Corinthian gulf and encouraged the Peloponnesians to attempt further aggressive operations at sea. In 428 BC, the Spartans would be so cowed by the memory of their defeats at Phormio&#x27;s hands that they sent no aid to Athens&#x27; rebellious subject Mytilene in that year. In 427, when they finally did send a fleet, the commander was so afraid of being caught at sea by the Athenians that he fled home without accomplishing anything.

<text>Physical comedy is a form of comedy focused on manipulation of the body for a humorous effect. It can include slapstick, clowning, mime, physical stunts, or making funny faces.

Physical comedy originated as part of the Commedia dell&#x27;arte. It is now sometimes incorporated into sitcoms; for example, in the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, actor John Ritter frequently performed &quot;pratfalls&quot;. Cartoons, particularly film shorts, also commonly depict an exaggerated form of physical comedy (incorporating cartoon physics), such as in &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

==Examples==
Charlie Chaplin started his film career as a physical comedian; although he developed additional means of comic expression, Chaplin&#x27;s mature works continued to contain elements of slapstick.

In the movies, physical comedy is used by, for example, 
* Jacques Tati as Monsieur Hulot, 
* Peter Sellers as Chief Inspector Clouseau in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; film series,
* Jackie Chan in many of his Hong Kong action comedy films,
* Zero Mostel&#x27;s character Max Bialystock in &quot;The Producers&quot;,
* Bette Midler&#x27;s, Goldie Hawn&#x27;s and Diane Keaton&#x27;s characters in &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;,
* Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s and Danny DeVito&#x27;s characters in &quot;Twins&quot;,
* Will Ferrell&#x27;s and John C. Reilly&#x27;s characters in &quot;Step Brothers&quot;,
* Zac Efron&#x27;s and Adam DeVine&#x27;s characters in &quot;Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates&quot;.
* Sacha Baron Cohen’s characters Borat Sagdiyev and Brüno Gehard in &quot;Borat&quot; (and its sequel &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;) and &quot;Brüno&quot;.
* Chris Farley&#x27;s and David Spade&#x27;s characters in Tommy Boy.

In television sitcoms, the use of physical comedy was seen in, for example, 
*Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s character Rob Petrie in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;,
*Lucille Ball&#x27;s character Lucy Ricardo in &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;,
*Martin Lawrence’s character Martin Payne in &quot;Martin&quot;,
*Larry Hagman&#x27;s character Major Anthony Nelson in &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;,
*John Ritter&#x27;s character Jack Tripper in &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;,
*The two main characters of Mark Linn-Baker and Bronson Pinchot in &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;,
*Michael Richards&#x27;s character Cosmo Kramer in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;,
*Penny Marshall&#x27;s character Laverne DeFazio and Cindy Williams&#x27; character Shirley Feeney in &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;,
*Jennifer Saunders&#x27; character Edina Monsoon and Joanna Lumley&#x27;s character Patsy Stone in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;,
*Nicholas Lyndhurst&#x27;s character Rodney Trotter in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;,
*Neil Morrissey&#x27;s character Tony in &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;,
*Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s character Rachel Green in &quot;Friends&quot;,
*Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s character Mr. Bean and Man vs. Bee,
*Jaleel White&#x27;s character Steve Urkel in &quot;Family Matters&quot;,
*Rik Mayall&#x27;s and Adrian Edmondson&#x27;s characters Richard Richard and Eddie Hitler in &quot;Bottom&quot;,
*James Corden&#x27;s character Neil Smith in &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;,
*Jim Belushi and Larry Joe Campbell&#x27;s characters Jim and Andy in &quot;According to Jim&quot;,
*Chevy Chase as various characters in numerous skits on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;
*Amanda Bynes in All That and The Amanda Show

<text>The redtoothed triggerfish (&quot;Odonus niger&quot;) is a triggerfish of the tropical Indo-Pacific area, and the sole member of its genus. Some other common names include blue triggerfish, redfang triggerfish, redtoothed filefish, and Niger triggerfish.

==Distribution==
The redtoothed triggerfish live in the widespread Indo-Pacific Ocean and Red Sea. They are found at the African east coast to Marquesas and Society islands. They can also be found as far north as Southern Japan and as far south as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
==Description==
Redtoothed triggerfish are normally deep purple with bluish-green markings on their heads and glowing light blue margins on the tail lobes and fins. Just like other fish in the family Balistidae, the tail is lyre-shaped. The mouth of the triggerfish seems to be grinning and it maintains tiny red teeth that are needle-sharp with two teeth in the upper jaw which can be seen when its mouth is closed. These triggerfish are one of the more peaceful triggers in the family but can become threatening with age and can perform a grunting-type sound. They can change their color depending on their mood, food, feeding, and water quality from purple to blue and bluish-green.

Their pectoral fins are quite small; as a result, they steer mostly with their dorsal and anal fins, which makes them very maneuverable, and they also use these fins to move with an exotic type of propulsion reminiscent of a propeller. It is one of the most singular swimming styles in the ocean.

==Behavior and diet==

Redtoothed triggerfish may inhabit reef channels or long slopes that have strong water currents. They survive by hiding under between rocks and crevices so they don&#x27;t get swept away by the water currents. They also may live in the coastal shallow inshore waters at depths of around 30 – 100 feet (9 – 30 meters). Redtoothed triggerfish are omnivorous and mostly opportunistic feeders, with crustaceans as its primary food source. They also feed on zooplankton and algae, and remains of cephalopods and fishes have been found in their stomach.

==Reproduction==
The redtoothed triggerfish have distinct pairing. They meet at mating grounds where males set up their territories. They build nests to lay their eggs in. The females take care of the eggs while both males and females guard the eggs waiting for them to hatch. While they can breed in the wild, they can not breed in aquariums.

<text>Clifford Bundy Stearns Sr. (born April 16, 1941) is an American businessman and politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1989 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party.

On August 14, 2012, Stearns lost to veterinarian Ted Yoho in a four-way Republican primary by about one percent of the vote.

In 2012, Stearns donated a collection of his papers to The George Washington University. The collection largely consists of his committee work, but also includes personal and political correspondence, briefing books, and travel agendas. The collection is currently under the care of GW&#x27;s Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.

Since leaving Congress, he has worked for APCO Worldwide, a public relations firm headquartered in Washington D.C. Stearns is also a member of APCO Worldwide International Advisory Council.

Stearns is also a member of APCO Worldwide International Advisory Council. He sits on the boards of the Graduate School of Political Management at The George Washington University, Minority Media &amp; Telecom Council, and the United States Association of Former Members of Congress. He is past President of the United States Association of Former Members of Congress.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Stearns was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Emily E. (Newlin) and Clifford Robert Stearns. He was educated at Woodrow Wilson High School, and later earned a degree in electrical engineering from George Washington University. He is also a member of the university&#x27;s Gamma Beta chapter of Theta Tau, a professional/social engineering fraternity, and participated in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps there and was honored as the Air Force ROTC Distinguished Military Graduate.

Following graduation, he served four years in the United States Air Force as an aerospace engineer in satellite reconnaissance during the Vietnam War. Stearns owned a small chain of motels and restaurants in northern Florida. Before moving to Florida, he worked with a variety of businesses in Florida, such as CBS, Data Control Systems Inc, and Kutola Advertising.

He was also a member of the Engineering Honor Society Sigma Tau, which later merged into the Tau Beta Pi Association which recognizes superior scholarship and/or leadership achievement in the fields of engineering.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;1988–2004
In 1988, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Buddy MacKay of Florida&#x27;s 6th congressional district decided to run for the U.S. Senate. Stearns and Jim Cherry qualified for a run-off election, since no one reached the 50% threshold in the six-candidate primary election. Cherry received 32% to Stearns&#x27;s 26%. In the run-off, Stearns defeated Cherry 54%–46%. In the general election, Stearns defeated State Representative Jon L. Mills 53%–47%. Until 2012, he never won re-election with less than 59% of the vote.

;2006

Stearns was re-elected with 60% of the vote.

;2008

Stearns was re-elected with 61% of the vote.

;2010

Stearns was re-elected with 71% of the vote.

;2012
Redistricting after the 2010 census shifted Stearns&#x27; home in Ocala to the 11th District (the old 5th District), but shifted the bulk of his territory to the Gainesville-based 3rd District. Rather than challenge freshman Republican Rich Nugent in the 11th, Stearns opted to run in the 3rd, which contained two-thirds of his former territory.

In the Republican primary for the 3rd—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Stearns lost to Ted Yoho by only some 800 votes, about 1% of the vote, in the Republican primary.

===Tenure===

Stearns is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

Stearns is a member of the Electronic Cigarette Association and supports the use of these products.

On September 29, 2008, Stearns voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

====Solyndra investigation====
As Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee&#x27;s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, Stearns led the investigation into the Solyndra loan guarantee, which has resulted in Solyndra declaring bankruptcy and the taxpayers losing $535 million. Among the revelations in the investigation are multiple warnings from government officials against giving Solyndra the loan because the company&#x27;s health was shaky. Even so, the White House pressed for a speedy review. The company, which faced a highly competitive environment, went bankrupt and was raided by the FBI for possible fraud.

Although the White House instituted an internal review of the loan guarantee program, Stearns believes that the review should have occurred before the Obama administration handed out the money.

Stearns received emails showing that the White House had a major influence on the loan guarantee as well as on the Solyndra loan restructuring that subordinated the taxpayers to two commercial firms in violation of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

====Fatal meningitis outbreak of 2012====
Stearns led the congressional effort involving the meningitis outbreak. As of November 14, 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 deaths and that 438 people have been sickened across 19 states. An investigation determined that the New England Compounding Center(NECC) was the source of the contaminated product. As Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Stearns held a hearing on this outbreak.

During the hearing, Stearns stated the outbreak was preventable had the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acted. The FDA knew of severe quality control violations at NEC as early as 2002, and in 2006 the FDA threatened NECC if it did not comply with regulations. During the hearing, FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg testified that the FDA lacked the authority to close down NECC.

Stearns noted that the FDA had authority to close NECC, but simply failed to protect the American people. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, deputy commissioner of the FDA from 2005 to 2007 and Mr. Sheldon Bradshaw, FDA&#x27;s chief counsel during that same period, disagreed strongly with Hamburg. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed on November 13, 2012, they stated unequivocally that FDA did have enough authority and could have acted but chose not to because of FDA&#x27;s desire to regulate &quot;the full scope of the practice of pharmacy.&quot; They further stated that NECC&#x27;s illegal actions, which FDA was aware of, that &quot;put the NECC firmly in violation of FDA rules-if the agency had chosen to enforce existing provisions.&quot;

====Abortion====
As Chairman of the Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Stearns conducted the first-ever oversight on taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the United States. The largest source of revenue for Planned Parenthood is government funding, but federal funds can&#x27;t be used for abortions. Many women depend on Planned Parenthood for essential health care like birth control, STD tests, pelvic exams, cancer screenings, and pregnancy-related services.
The investigation was started in response to an investigative report released in July 2011 by the anti-abortion organization Americans United for Life (AUL). According to AUL, &quot;Audits of Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, New Jersey, New York, and Washington State demonstrate a pattern of overbilling and abuse involving Medicaid funds, and in at least Washington even charging drugs used in an abortion as &#x27;family planning.&#x27; Furthermore, State audit reports and admissions by former Planned Parenthood employees detail a pattern of misuse of federal funds by some Planned Parenthood affiliates.&quot;

The investigation was sweeping, requesting internal audits dating back 12 years and state audits for the past 20 years for the national organization and all 83 of its affiliates. Representative Henry Waxman questioned the political motivations for the timing of the investigation, saying, &quot;Your fervent ideological opposition to Planned Parenthood does not justify launching this intrusive investigation.&quot;

On January 31, 2012, The Susan G. Komen for the Cure organization stopped funding Planned Parenthood, stating that the congressional investigation by Stearns triggered a newly created internal rule about not funding organizations under any federal, state or local investigation. Planned Parenthood is regularly audited to ensure compliance with the Hyde Amendment: these audits have never turned up any evidence of wrongdoing. While the move was applauded by conservative anti-abortion groups, it was denounced by several newspaper editorials, women&#x27;s health advocacy groups, and politicians. Four days later, Komen&#x27;s Board of Directors reversed the decision and announced that it would amend the policy to &quot;make clear that disqualifying investigations must be criminal and conclusive in nature and not political&quot;. Karen Handel, Komen&#x27;s vice president for public policy, resigned as a result of Komen&#x27;s reversal.

====Economic issues====
Stearns held several economic roundtables throughout the district, meeting with business owners, bankers, and realtors to get their views on improving the creating of jobs.
Last year, he sponsored four homeowner workshops in Ocala, Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Orange Park. He brought in realtors, bankers, and mortgage experts to help people who are having trouble making their payments – they also provided essential information for first-time homebuyers.

In meeting with community bankers from Florida, he learned that 70% of Florida&#x27;s community banks are under some kind of regulatory order that reduce capital for businesses to grow and loans to revitalize the housing industry.

He took a leadership role for the Florida delegation in sending a letter to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman Sheila Bair, claiming that banking examiners may be pursuing an unreasonably tough analysis of Florida banks’ asset quality and are regularly requiring downgrades of performing loans.

====Fiscal issues====
Stearns was one of only 39 House members to receive an &quot;A&quot; rating from the National Taxpayers Union (NTU). In addition, in 2010 Citizens Against Government Waste once again named Stearns a &quot;Taxpayer Hero.&quot;

Stearns also is a strong opponent of automatic congressional pay raises. He also offered legislation to prevent a pay increase in a year following a federal budget deficit.

In fiscal years 2008–2010, Stearns sponsored 46 earmarks totaling $85,810,100.

Stearns voted for Cut, Cap &amp; Balance &amp; the Boehner Debt Ceiling Bill; however, he voted against the final Debt Ceiling compromise bill (The &quot;Budget Control Act of 2011&quot;).

====Veterans issues====
Throughout his tenure, Stearns served on the Veterans Affairs Committee. He advocates for increased funding for the VA and pushed to establish a VA cemetery in the Jacksonville area. He supports the VA&#x27;s CARES plan to develop a new Regional Health Care Facility in Marion County and the expansion of the VA Hospital in Gainesville with a new 230-bed patient tower. The groundbreaking for this addition occurred in 2008. His Veterans Millennium Health care &amp; Benefits Act and language from his VA Health Care Personnel Act to increase pay for VA health professionals were signed into law.

====Technology and privacy====
Stearns has been working on extending privacy protection for about 10 years. In 2003, the International Association of Privacy Professionals gave Stearns its Privacy Leadership Award for his efforts on leadership, including holding the most extensive hearings on privacy issues as Chairman of the Commerce, Trade &amp; Consumer Protection Subcommittee.

On April 13, 2011, Stearns offered bi-partisan legislation to protect consumer privacy on line—H.R. 1528, the Consumer Privacy Protection Act. The goal is to encourage greater levels of electronic commerce by providing to Internet users the assurance that their experience online will be more secure.

Stearns also is a leader in opposing net neutrality.

Stearns voted for the Patriot Act.

Stearns is the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee&#x27;s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. From 2001 until 2007, Stearns was Chairman of the Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee and he still serves on the Subcommittee.
He helped to create the Do-Not-Call List to protect consumers from unwanted telephone solicitations and legislation to combat spyware, which is software that allows a third party to monitor the computer use of individuals without their knowledge.

====Energy issues====
Stearns was a member of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, a bi-partisan forum for discussing and disseminating information about renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. Stearns’ paper on developing clean-coal technology and applying coal-to-liquid technology was published in December 2008 in the Stanford Law &amp; Policy Review.

During consideration of cap-and-trade legislation in the Energy and Commerce Committee in May 2009, Stearns offered an amendment to afford existing nuclear power plants the same benefits provided to new nuclear power plants in the bill. The amendment simply recognized that nuclear is carbon free and did not provide any new subsidy to the industry.

In 2008, Stearns joined in offering a package of bills to increase domestic energy production. This included more domestic oil and gas production, greater use of clean-coal technology, reducing the barriers to new nuclear power plants, and encouraging renewable energy sources.

====Health care====
During consideration of the health care legislation, Stearns offered the following amendments:
* Provide tax deduction for health care;
* Require the President, Supreme Court Justices, and Members of Congress to buy their coverage of the Exchange:
* Eliminate the tax on medical devices;
* Repeal the cuts to Medicare Advantage.

====9/11 first responders====
During the debate over compensation for 9/11 first responders and others, Stearns advocated a &quot;standard re-authorization and appropriation process&quot;. Congressman Stearns submitted an amendment that was adopted without opposition to H.R.#847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, that would screen thousands of non-first responders and First Responders who submit claims for chronic medical conditions against a Department of Homeland Security terrorist watch list (original committee markup referenced).

<text>The yellowmargin triggerfish, pineapple trigger, yellowface triggerfish or yellow-face triggerfish (&quot;Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus&quot;) is a marine fish in the family Balistidae. It is found in coastal tropical waters and reefs of the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea south to Natal, South Africa and east from southern Japan south to Indonesia, the Philippines and Samoa, at water depths from .
This triggerfish can grow to a maximum length of . They are marketed either fresh or dried for food, but are potentially dangerous in some areas due to ciguatera poisoning.

The yellowmargin triggerfish is oviparous, spawning in pairs. The female fish guards the nests aggressively. When not mating, this fish is solitary or may remain in pairs.

<text>The Elephant&#x27;s Trunk Nebula is a concentration of interstellar gas and dust within the much larger ionized gas region IC 1396 located in the constellation Cepheus about 2,400 light years away from Earth. The piece of the nebula shown here is the dark, dense globule IC 1396A; it is commonly called the Elephant&#x27;s Trunk nebula because of its appearance at visible light wavelengths, where there is a dark patch with a bright, sinuous rim. The bright rim is the surface of the dense cloud that is being illuminated and ionized by a very bright, massive star (HD 206267) that is just to the east of IC 1396A. (In the Spitzer Space Telescope view shown, the massive star is just to the left of the edge of the image.) The entire IC 1396 region is ionized by the massive star, except for dense globules that can protect themselves from the star&#x27;s harsh ultraviolet rays.

The Elephant&#x27;s Trunk Nebula is now thought to be a site of star formation, containing several very young (less than 100,000 yr) stars that were discovered in infrared images in 2003. Two older (but still young, a couple of million years, by the standards of stars, which live for billions of years) stars are present in a small, circular cavity in the head of the globule. Winds from these young stars may have emptied the cavity.

The combined action of the light from the massive star ionizing and compressing the rim of the cloud, and the wind from the young stars shifting gas from the center outward lead to very high compression in the Elephant&#x27;s Trunk Nebula. This pressure has triggered the current generation of protostars.

<doc id="410984" wikidata="Q918506" url="?curid=410984" title="John Mica">
<text>John Luigi Mica (born January 27, 1943) is an American businessman, consultant and Republican politician who represented in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 to 2017. He was defeated by Democrat Stephanie Murphy in the November 8, 2016, general election while serving his 12th term in office.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Mica was born in Binghamton, New York, and grew up in Florida. He was educated at Miami Edison High School, Miami-Dade Community College and the University of Florida, where he received a degree in education and was a member of Delta Chi fraternity and Florida Blue Key. He has been a businessman serving in the real estate, telecommunications, government affairs and consulting fields.

== Early political career ==
Mica was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980 and served on several committees, including the Appropriations Committee. He was a staff member for Senator Paula F. Hawkins from 1981 to 1985 and became her chief of staff.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

==== 1992 ====
In 1992, Mica ran for Congress in the 7th District, previously the 4th District represented by two-term Republican Craig T. James.
Mica won the Republican primary with 53% of the vote, defeating State Representative Richard Graham (34%) and Vaughn Forrest (13%). In the general election, he defeated Democrat Dan Webster 56%–44%.

==== 1994–2004 ====
During this time period, he won re-election every two years with at least 60% of the vote.

==== 2006 ====

Mica defeated Jack Chagnon 63%–37%.

==== 2008 ====

Mica defeated Faye Armitage 62%–38%.

==== 2010 ====

Mica defeated Heather Beaven 69%–31%.

==== 2012 ====

For his first 10 terms, Mica represented a district that stretched from the Orlando suburbs through Daytona Beach all the way to St. Augustine.

After the 2010 Census, the bulk of Mica&#x27;s territory became the 6th District. However, most of the Orange County portion, including Mica&#x27;s home in Winter Park, was drawn into the new 7th District. That district had previously been the 24th District, represented by freshman Republican Sandy Adams. Although the new 7th was over 58 percent new to Mica, he defeated Adams in the Republican primary with 61 percent of the vote. In the general election, Mica defeated Jason Kendall 59%–41%.

==== 2014 ====

Mica defeated Wes Neuman 64%–32%.

==== 2016 ====

A court-ordered redistricting made the 7th slightly friendlier to Democrats. The new map cut out the district&#x27;s share of Volusia County, while pushing it farther into Orlando.

The 7th had already been a marginal district, even though Mica had been elected twice from this district without serious difficulty. Mitt Romney narrowly won it over Barack Obama in 2012, with 51 percent of the vote. In contrast, had the redrawn 7th existed in 2012, Obama would have won it with 49.4 percent.

In the general election, Mica lost to Democrat Stephanie Murphy by a margin of 51%–49%.

===Tenure===

In November 1997, Mica was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Mica voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Mica voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).

==Policy positions==

===Abortion===
Mica opposes abortion. Regarding taxpayer funding of abortion through Planned Parenthood, he has said &quot;I think the majority of Americans would oppose public, federal dollars going into abortion.&quot;

===Economic issues===
Mica voted against the 2009 stimulus. He has brought federal money for Florida highways, SunRail, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, and the University of Central Florida.

===Transportation===
Mica supports Amtrak privatization. In 2009, he earmarked $13 million for the Central Florida Commuter Rail, which was supported by a client of Mica&#x27;s daughter.

Mica has been opposed to the federal government contributing any additional funds towards repairing the Washington DC Metrorail system.

===Marijuana===
As chairman of the House Oversight Committee&#x27;s subcommittee on government operations, Mica convened a hearing on marijuana legalization in 1999. It was the first such hearing since 1988. Mica opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana.
Another such hearing was held by Mica in 2014 on the same subject, with multiple drug experts providing input.

==Electoral history==






















==Committee assignments==
Mica was chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from January 3, 2011, to December 2012.

* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (former Chairman)
* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
** Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives
** Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs

==Personal life==
Mica is married to Patricia, a schoolteacher, and has two grown children. He lives in Winter Park, Florida. He is the brother of former Representative Daniel A. Mica, while his other brother, David, is a former ranking staffer of Senator Lawton Chiles. He is a member of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees and the Coast Guard Academy Board of Visitors. He is an Episcopalian.

<text>Pseudobalistes fuscus (common names: blue triggerfish, rippled triggerfish, yellow-spotted triggerfish and blue-and-gold triggerfish) is a fish belonging to the family Balistidae.

==Description==

&quot;Pseudobalistes fuscus&quot; can reach a length of 55 centimetres (22 inches) in males. The body is mainly brown, but fins have yellow margins. Juveniles are yellowish brown with a network of brilliant bluish wavy lines. With growth these lines become interconnected.

This fish is known for its aggressiveness and many divers choose to stay away from them, as they bite often.

==Distribution==
This species is widespread in the Tropical Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea to South Africa, Society Islands, southern Japan, Australia and New Caledonia.

==Habitat==
&quot;Pseudobalistes fuscus&quot; is a reef-associated species. It prefers coastal waters, shallow lagoons and seaward reefs, at of depth.

==Diet==
This triggerfish, like most other triggerfish, eats shellfish, small crustaceans, and other bottom-dwelling invertebrae.

<text>According to Latter Day Saint belief, the golden plates (also called the gold plates or in some 19th-century literature, the golden bible) are the source from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, a sacred text of the faith. Some accounts from people who reported handling the plates describe the plates as weighing from , gold in color, and composed of thin metallic pages engraved with hieroglyphics on both sides and bound with three D-shaped rings.

Smith found the plates on September 22, 1823, on a hill near his home in Manchester, New York, after the angel Moroni directed him to a buried stone box. He said that the angel prevented him from taking the plates but instructed him to return to the same location in a year. He returned to that site every year, but it was not until September 1827 that he recovered the plates on his fourth annual attempt to retrieve them. He returned home with a heavy object wrapped in a frock, which he then put in a box. He allowed others to heft the box but said that the angel had forbidden him to show the plates to anyone until they had been translated from their original &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; language.

Smith dictated the text of the plates while a scribe wrote down the words which would later become the Book of Mormon. Eyewitnesses to the process said Smith translated the plates, not by looking directly at them, but by looking through a transparent seer stone in the bottom of his hat. Smith published the first edition of the translation in March 1830 as the Book of Mormon, with a print run of 5,000 copies at a production cost of $3,000 (or 60 cents per book).

Smith obtained testimonies from 11 men who said that they had seen the plates, known as the Book of Mormon witnesses. After the translation was complete, Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel Moroni; thus, they could not be re-examined. Latter Day Saints believe the account of the golden plates as a matter of faith, while critics often assert that Smith manufactured them himself.

==Origin and historicity==
In the words of Mormon historian Richard Bushman, &quot;For most modern readers, the plates are beyond belief, a phantasm, yet the Mormon sources accept them as fact.&quot; Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel Moroni after he finished translating them, and their authenticity cannot be determined by physical examination. They were reportedly shown to several close associates of Smith. Mormon scholars have formed collaborations such as Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies to provide apologetic answers to critical research about the golden plates and topics in the field of Mormon studies. The credibility of the plates has been a &quot;troublesome item&quot;, according to Bushman.

The Book of Mormon itself portrays the golden plates as a historical record, engraved by two pre-Columbian prophet-historians from around the year AD 400: Mormon and his son Moroni. Mormon and Moroni, the book says, had abridged earlier historical records from other sets of metal plates. Their script, according to the book, was described as &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot;, a language unknown to linguists or Egyptologists. Scholarly reference works on languages do not acknowledge the existence of either a &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; language or &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; script as it has been described in Mormon belief, and there is no archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in ancient America. Historically, Latter Day Saint movement denominations have taught that the Book of Mormon&#x27;s description of the plates&#x27; origin is accurate, and that the Book of Mormon is a translation of the plates. The Community of Christ, however, accepts the Book of Mormon as scripture but no longer takes an official position on the historicity of the golden plates. Some adherents accept the Book of Mormon as inspired scripture but do not believe that it is a literal translation of a physical historical record, even in the more theologically conservative Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Non-Mormons and some liberal Mormons have advanced naturalistic explanations for the story of the plates. For example, it has been theorized that the plates were fashioned by Smith or one of his associates, that Smith had the ability to convince others of their existence through illusions or hypnosis, or that witnesses were having ecstatic visions.

==Story==

The story of the golden plates consists of how, according to Joseph Smith and his contemporaries, the plates were found, received from the angel Moroni, translated, and returned to the angel before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Smith is the only source for a great deal of the story because much of it occurred while he was the only human witness. Nevertheless, Smith told the story to his family, friends, and acquaintances, and many of them provided second-hand accounts. Other parts of the story are derived from the statements of those who knew Smith, including several witnesses who said that they saw the golden plates.

The best-known elements of the golden plates story are found in an account told by Smith in 1838 and incorporated into the official church histories of some Latter Day Saint movement denominations. The LDS Church has canonized part of this 1838 account as part of its scripture, the Pearl of Great Price.

===Background===
During the Second Great Awakening, Joseph Smith lived on his parents&#x27; farm near Palmyra, New York. At the time, churches in the region contended so vigorously for souls that western New York later became known as the &quot;burned-over district&quot; because the fires of religious revivals had burned over it so often. Western New York was also noted for its participation in a &quot;craze for treasure hunting&quot;. Beginning as a youth in the early 1820s, Smith was periodically hired, for about $14 per month, as a scryer, using what were termed &quot;seer stones&quot; in attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure. Smith&#x27;s contemporaries described his method for seeking treasure as putting the stone in a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, and then &quot;seeing&quot; the information in the reflections of the stone.

According to Richard Bushman, Smith did not consider himself to be a &quot;peeper&quot; or &quot;glass-looker&quot;, a practice he is said to have called &quot;nonsense&quot;, despite his use of seer stones. Rather, Smith and his family viewed their folk magical practices as spiritual gifts. Although Smith later rejected his youthful treasure-hunting activities as frivolous and immaterial, he never repudiated the stones themselves, denied their presumed power to find treasure, or ever relinquish the magic culture in which he was raised. He came to view seeing with a stone in religious terms as the work of a &quot;seer&quot;. Smith&#x27;s first stone, apparently the same one that he used at least part of the time to translate the golden plates, was chocolate-colored and about the size of a chicken egg, found in a deep well he helped dig for one of his neighbors. The LDS Church released photographs of the stone on August 4, 2015.

===Finding the plates===
According to Smith, he found the plates after he was directed to them by a heavenly messenger whom he later identified as the angel Moroni. According to the story, the angel first visited Smith&#x27;s bedroom late at night, on September 22 in 1822 or 1823. Moroni told Smith that the plates could be found buried in a prominent hill near his home, later called &quot;Cumorah&quot;, a name found in the Book of Mormon. Before dawn, Moroni reappeared two more times and repeated the information.
However, the angel would not allow Smith to take the plates until he obeyed certain &quot;commandments&quot;. Smith recorded some of these commandments but made it clear the main thrust of Moroni&#x27;s message was that he had to keep God&#x27;s commandments in general. Some contemporaries who later claimed he told them the story said there were others, some of which are relevant to the modern debate about whether or how closely events of early Mormonism were related to the practice of contemporary folk magic. Smith&#x27;s writings say that the angel required at least the following: (1) that he have no thought of using the plates for monetary gain, (2) that he tell his father about the vision, and (3) that he never show the plates to any unauthorized person. Smith&#x27;s contemporaries who claimed to have heard the story, both sympathetic and unsympathetic, generally agreed that Smith mentioned the following additional commandments: (4) that Smith take the plates and leave the site in which they had been buried without looking back, and (5) that the plates never directly touch the ground until they were safe at home in a locked chest. Some unsympathetic listeners who allegedly heard the story from Smith or his father recalled that Smith had said the angel required him (6) to wear &quot;black clothes&quot; to the place where the plates were buried, (7) to ride a &quot;black horse with a switchtail&quot;, (8) to call for the plates by a certain name, and (9) to &quot;give thanks to God.&quot;

In the morning, Smith began work as usual and did not mention the visions to his father because, he said, he did not think his father would believe him. Smith said he then fainted because he had been awake all night, and while unconscious, the angel appeared a fourth time and chastised him for failing to tell the visions to his father. When Smith then told all to his father, he believed his son and encouraged him to obey the angel&#x27;s commands. Smith then set off to visit the hill, later stating that he used his seer stone to locate the place that the plates were buried but that he &quot;knew the place the instant that [he] arrived there.&quot;

Smith said he saw a large stone covering a box made of stone (or possibly iron). Using a stick to remove dirt from the edges of the stone cover and prying it up with a lever, Smith saw the plates inside the box, together with other artifacts.

===Unsuccessful retrieval attempts===
According to Smith&#x27;s followers, Smith said he took the plates from the box, put them on the ground, and covered the box with the stone to protect the other treasures that it contained. Nevertheless, the accounts say that when Smith looked back at the ground after closing the box, the plates had once again disappeared into it. When Smith once again raised the stone and attempted to retrieve the plates, he said that he was stricken by a supernatural force that hurled him to the ground as many as three times.

Disconcerted by his inability to obtain the plates, Smith said he briefly wondered whether his experience had been a &quot;dreem of Vision&quot; [sic]. Concluding that it was not, he said he prayed to ask why he had been barred from taking the plates.

In response to his question, Smith said the angel appeared and told him he could not receive the plates because he &quot;had been tempted of the advisary and saught the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have an eye single to the Glory of God&quot; [sic]. According to Smith&#x27;s followers, Smith had also broken the angel&#x27;s commandment &quot;not to lay the plates down, or put them for a moment out of his hands,&quot; and according to a nonbeliever, Smith said, &quot;I had forgotten to give thanks to God,&quot; as required by the angel.

Smith said the angel instructed him to return the next year, on September 22, 1824, with the &quot;right person&quot;: his older brother Alvin. Alvin had died in November 1823, and Smith returned to the hill in 1824 to ask what he should do. Smith said he was told to return the following year (1825) with the &quot;right person&quot; but the angel did not tell Smith who that person might be. However, Smith determined after looking into his seer stone that the &quot;right person&quot; was Emma Hale, his future wife. For the visit on September 22, 1825, Smith may have attempted to bring his treasure-hunting associate Samuel T. Lawrence.

Smith said that he visited the hill &quot;at the end of each year&quot; for four years after the first visit in 1823, but there is no record of him being in the vicinity of Palmyra between January 1826 and January 1827, when he returned to New York from Pennsylvania with his new wife. In January 1827, Smith visited the hill and then told his parents that the angel had severely chastised him for not being &quot;engaged enough in the work of the Lord,&quot; which may have meant that he had missed his annual visit to the hill in 1826.

===Receiving the plates===
The next annual visit on September 22, 1827, would be, Smith told associates, his last chance to receive the plates. According to Brigham Young, as the scheduled final date to obtain the plates approached, several Palmyra residents expressed concern &quot;that they were going to lose that treasure&quot; and sent for a skilled necromancer from 60 miles (96 km) away, encouraging him to make three separate trips to Palmyra to find the plates. During one of the trips, the unnamed necromancer is said to have discovered the location but was unable to determine the value of the plates. A few days prior to the September 22, 1827, visit to the hill, Smith&#x27;s loyal treasure-hunting friends Josiah Stowell and Joseph Knight Sr. traveled to Palmyra, in part, to be there during Smith&#x27;s scheduled visit to the hill.

Another of Smith&#x27;s former treasure-hunting associates, Samuel T. Lawrence, was also apparently aware of the approaching date to obtain the plates, and Smith was concerned that he might cause trouble. Therefore, on the eve of September 22, 1827, the scheduled date for retrieving the plates, Smith dispatched his father to spy on Lawrence&#x27;s house until dark. If Lawrence attempted to leave, the elder Smith was to tell him that his son would &quot;thrash the stumps with him&quot; if he found him at the hill. Late at night, Smith took a horse and carriage to the hill Cumorah with Emma. While Emma stayed behind kneeling in prayer, Smith walked to the site of the buried plates. Sometime in the early morning hours, he said that he retrieved the plates and hid them in a hollow log on or near Cumorah. At the same time, Smith said he received a pair of large spectacles he called the Urim and Thummim or &quot;Interpreters,&quot; with lenses consisting of two seer stones, which he showed his mother when he returned in the morning.

Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby Macedon to earn enough money to buy a solid lockable chest in which to put the plates. By then, however, some of Smith&#x27;s treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith had said that he had been successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their share of the profits from what they viewed as part of a joint venture in treasure hunting. Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith Sr., determined that a group of ten to twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from 60 miles (96 km) away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of divination. When Emma heard of that, she rode a stray horse to Macedon and informed Smith, who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe. He nevertheless hurriedly rode home with Emma.

Once home in Manchester, he said he walked to Cumorah, removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked home through the woods and away from the road with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm. On the way, he said a man had sprung up from behind a log and struck him a &quot;heavy blow with a gun... Knocking the man down with a single punch, Joseph ran as fast as he could for about a half mile before he was attacked by a second man trying to get the plates. After similarly overpowering the man, Joseph continued to run, but before he reached the house, a third man hit him with a gun. In striking the last man, Joseph said, he injured his thumb.&quot; He returned home with a dislocated thumb and other minor injuries. Smith sent his father, Joseph Knight, and Josiah Stowell to search for the pursuers, but they found no one.

Smith is said to have put the plates in a locked chest and hid them in his parents&#x27; home in Manchester. He refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates or the other artifacts that he said he had in his possession, but some people were allowed to heft them or feel what were said to be the artifacts through a cloth. A few days after retrieving the plates, Smith brought home what he said was an ancient breastplate, which he said had been hidden in the box at Cumorah with the plates. After letting his mother feel through a thin cloth what she said was the breastplate, he placed it in the locked chest.

The Smith home was approached &quot;nearly every night&quot; by villagers hoping to find the chest, where Smith said the plates were kept. After hearing that a group of them would attempt to enter the house by force, Smith buried the chest under the hearth, and the family was able to scare away the intended intruders. Fearing the chest might still be discovered, Smith hid it under the floor boards of his parents&#x27; old log home nearby that was then being used as a cooper shop. Later, Smith told his mother he had taken the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floorboards of the cooper shop, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax. Shortly thereafter the empty box was discovered, and the place ransacked by Smith&#x27;s former treasure-seeking associates, who had enlisted one of the men&#x27;s sisters to find the hiding place by looking in her seer stone.

===Translating the plates===
Smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language, and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them. The translation took place mainly in Harmony, Pennsylvania (now Oakland Township), Emma&#x27;s hometown, where Smith and his wife had moved in October 1827 with financial assistance from a prominent, though superstitious, Palmyra landowner Martin Harris. The translation occurred in two phases: the first, from December 1827 to June 1828, during which Smith transcribed some of the characters and then dictated 116 manuscript pages to Harris, which were lost. The second phase began sporadically in early 1829 and then in earnest in April 1829 with the arrival of Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher who volunteered to serve as Smith&#x27;s full-time scribe. In June 1829, Smith and Cowdery moved to Fayette, New York, completing the translation early the following month.
Smith used scribes to write the words he said were a translation of the golden plates, dictating the words while peering into seer stones, which he said allowed him to see the translation. Smith&#x27;s translation process evolved from his previous use of seer stones in treasure-seeking. During the earliest phase of translation, Smith said he used what he called Urim and Thummim, two stones set in a frame like a set of large spectacles. Witnesses said Smith placed the Urim and Thummim in his hat while he was translating.

After the loss of the first 116 manuscript pages, Smith translated with a single seer stone, which some sources say he had previously used in treasure-seeking. Smith placed the stone in a hat, buried his face in it to eliminate all outside light, and peered into the stone to see the words of the translation. A few times during the translation, a curtain or blanket was raised between Smith and his scribe or between the living area and the area where Smith and his scribe worked. Sometimes, Smith dictated to Harris from upstairs or from a different room.

Smith&#x27;s translation did not require the use of the plates themselves. Though Smith himself said very little about the translation process, his friends and family said that as he looked into the stone, the written translation of the ancient script appeared to him in English. There are several proposed explanations for how Smith composed his translation. In the 19th century, the most common explanation among anti-Mormons was that he copied the work from a manuscript written by Solomon Spaulding. That theory is repudiated by Smith&#x27;s preeminent modern biographers. The most prominent modern theory among many ex-Mormons is that Smith composed the translation in response to the provincial opinions of his time, perhaps while in a magical trance-like state. As a matter of faith, Latter Day Saints generally view the translation process as either an automatic process of transcribing text written within the stone or an intuitive translation by Smith, assisted by a mystical connection with God, through the stone. Some Latter Day Saint apologists argue that because of the length of the Book of Mormon (roughly 270,000 words) and the timeframe in which the Book was dictated, it is unlikely that he wrote it or memorized the words from elsewhere. It is also argued that Smith was unfamiliar with the text, often pausing to attempt to pronounce names of people and places that were unfamiliar to him, and therefore it is unlikely that he had read the text before or written it previously.

Smith&#x27;s dictations were written down by a number of assistants, including Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and Oliver Cowdery. In May 1829, after Smith had lent 116 unduplicated manuscript pages to Harris, and Harris had lost them, Smith dictated a revelation explaining that Smith could not simply retranslate the lost pages because his opponents would attempt to see if he could &quot;bring forth the same words again.&quot; According to Grant Palmer, Smith believed &quot;a second transcription would be identical to the first. This confirms the view that the English text existed in some kind of unalterable, spiritual form rather than that someone had to think through difficult conceptual issues and idioms, always resulting in variants in any translation.&quot;

===Location of the plates during translation===
When Smith and Emma moved to Pennsylvania in October 1827, they transported a wooden box, which Smith said contained the plates, hidden in a barrel of beans. For a time, the couple stayed in the home of Emma&#x27;s father, Isaac Hale, but when Smith refused to show Hale the plates, Hale banished the concealed objects from his house. Afterward, Smith told several of his associates that the plates were hidden in the nearby woods. Emma said that she remembered the plates being on a table in the house, wrapped in a linen tablecloth, which she moved from time to time when it got in the way of her chores. According to Smith&#x27;s mother, the plates were also stored in a trunk on Emma&#x27;s bureau. However, Smith did not require the physical presence of the plates to translate them.

In April 1828, Martin Harris&#x27;s wife, Lucy, visited Harmony with her husband and demanded to see the plates. When Smith refused to show them to her, she searched the house, grounds, and woods. According to Smith&#x27;s mother, during the search Lucy was frightened by a large, black snake and so was prevented from digging up the plates. As a result of Martin Harris&#x27;s loss of the 116 pages of manuscript, Smith said that between July and September 1828, the angel Moroni took back both the plates and the Urim and Thummim as a penalty for his having delivered &quot;the manuscript into the hands of a wicked man.&quot; According to Smith&#x27;s mother, the angel returned the objects to Smith on September 22, 1828, the anniversary of the day that he first received them.

In March 1829, Martin Harris visited Harmony and asked to see the plates. Smith told him that he &quot;would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself.&quot; Harris followed the directions but could not find the plates.

In early June 1829, the unwanted attentions of locals around Harmony necessitated Smith&#x27;s move to the home of David Whitmer and his parents in Fayette, New York. Smith said that during this move the plates were transported by the angel Moroni, who put them in the garden of the Whitmer house, where Smith could recover them. The translation was completed at the Whitmer home.

===Returning the plates===

After translation was complete, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel, but he did not elaborate about this experience. According to accounts by several early Mormons, a group of Mormon leaders, including Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and possibly others accompanied Smith and returned the plates to a cave inside the Hill Cumorah. There, Smith is said to have placed the plates on a table near &quot;many wagon loads&quot; of other ancient records, and the Sword of Laban hanging on the cave wall.

Smith taught that part of the golden plates were &quot;sealed.&quot; The &quot;sealed&quot; portion is said to contain &quot;a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.&quot; Many Latter Day Saints believe that the plates will be kept hidden until a future time, when the sealed part will be translated and, according to one early Mormon leader, transferred from the hill to one of the Mormon temples.

David Whitmer is quoted as stating that he saw just the &quot;untranslated&quot; portion of the plates sitting on the table with the sword (and also a breastplate). Apparently, Whitmer was aware of expeditions at Cumorah to locate the sealed portion of the plates through &quot;science and mineral rods.&quot;

==Descriptions of the plates==
Smith said the angel Moroni had commanded him not to show the plates to any unauthorized person. However, Smith eventually obtained the written statement of several witnesses who saw the plates. It is unclear whether the witnesses believed they had seen the plates with their physical eyes or had seen them in a vision. For instance, although Martin Harris continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he &quot;seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience.&quot;

According to some sources, Smith initially intended that the first authorized witness be his firstborn son; but this child was stillborn in 1828. In March 1829, Martin Harris came to Harmony to see the plates, but was unable to find them in the woods where Smith said they could be found. The next day, Smith dictated a revelation stating that Harris could eventually qualify himself to be one of three witnesses with the exclusive right to &quot;view [the plates] as they are&quot;.

By June 1829, Smith determined that there would be eight additional witnesses, a total of twelve including Smith. During the second half of June 1829, Smith took Harris, Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer (known collectively as the Three Witnesses) into woods in Fayette, New York, where they said they saw an angel holding the golden plates and turning the leaves. The four also said they heard &quot;the voice of the Lord&quot; telling them that the translation of the plates was correct, and commanding them to testify of what they saw and heard. A few days later, Smith took a different group of Eight Witnesses to a location near Smith&#x27;s parents&#x27; home in Palmyra where they said Smith showed them the golden plates. Statements over the names of these men, apparently drafted by Smith, were published in 1830 as an appendix to the Book of Mormon. According to later statements ascribed to Martin Harris, he viewed the plates in a vision and not with his &quot;natural eyes.&quot;

In addition to Smith and the other eleven who claimed to be witnesses, a few other early Mormons said they saw the plates. For instance, Smith&#x27;s mother Lucy Mack Smith said she had &quot;seen and handled&quot; the plates. Smith&#x27;s wife Emma and his younger brother William and younger sister Katharine also said they had examined and lifted the plates while they were wrapped in fabric. Others said they had visions of the plates or had been shown the plates by an angel, in some cases years after Smith said he had returned the plates.

===Described format, binding, and dimensions===
The plates were said to be bound at one edge by a set of rings. In 1828, Martin Harris, is reported to have said that the plates were &quot;fastened together in the shape of a book by wires&quot;. In 1859 Harris said that the plates &quot;were seven inches [18 cm] wide by eight inches [20 cm] in length, and were of the thickness of plates of tin; and when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches [10 cm] thick; and they were put together on the back by three silver rings, so that they would open like a book&quot;. David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses, was quoted by an 1831 Palmyra newspaper as having said the plates were &quot;the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings ... passing through each leaf in succession&quot;. Anomalously, Smith&#x27;s father is quoted as saying that the plates were only half an inch (1.27 centimeter) thick. Smith&#x27;s mother, who said she had &quot;seen and handled&quot; the plates, is quoted as saying they were &quot;eight inches [20 cm] long, and six [15 cm] wide ... all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate&quot;.

Hyrum Smith and John Whitmer, also witnesses in 1829, are reported to have stated that the rings holding the plates together were, in Hyrum&#x27;s words, &quot;in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book&quot;. Smith&#x27;s wife Emma and his younger brother William said they had examined the plates while wrapped in fabric. Emma said she &quot;felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book&quot;. William agreed that the plates could be rustled with one&#x27;s thumb like the pages of a book.

Smith did not provide his own published description of the plates until 1842, when he said in a letter that &quot;each plate was six inches [15 cm] wide and eight inches [20 cm] long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were ... bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches [15 cm] in thickness&quot;.

===Described composition and weight===
The plates were first described as &quot;gold&quot;, and beginning about 1827, the plates were widely called the &quot;gold bible&quot;. When the Book of Mormon was published in 1830, the Eight Witnesses described the plates as having &quot;the appearance of gold&quot;. The Book of Mormon describes the plates as being made of &quot;ore&quot;. In a June 1830 court hearing, Josiah Stowell testified that he inadvertently caught a glimpse of a corner of the plates (making him &quot;the only witness to see the plates &#x27;by accident,) and said it &quot;resembled a stone of a greenish caste.&quot; In 1831, a Palmyra newspaper quoted David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses, as having said that the plates were a &quot;&quot;whitish yellow&quot; color&quot;, with &quot;three small rings of the same metal&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s first published description of the plates said that the plates &quot;had the appearance of gold&quot;, and Smith said that Moroni had referred to the plates as &quot;gold.&quot; Late in life, Martin Harris stated that the rings holding the plates together were made of silver, and he said the plates themselves, based on their heft of &quot;forty or fifty pounds&quot; (18–23 kg), &quot;were lead or gold&quot;. Joseph&#x27;s brother William, who said he felt the plates inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood the plates to be &quot;a mixture of gold and copper ... much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood&quot;.

Different people estimated the weight of the plates differently. According to Smith&#x27;s one-time-friend Willard Chase, Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between 40 and 60 pounds (18–27 kg), most likely the latter. Smith&#x27;s father Joseph Smith Sr., who was one of the Eight Witnesses, reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they &quot;weighed thirty pounds&quot; (14 kg). Smith&#x27;s brother William, who had lifted the plates, thought they &quot;weighed about sixty pounds [27 kg] according to the best of my judgment&quot;. Others who lifted the plates while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about 60 pounds [27 kg]. Martin Harris said that he had &quot;hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds [18–23 kg]&quot;. Smith&#x27;s wife Emma never estimated the weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to &quot;move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work&quot;.

From descriptions of the plates&#x27; dimensions, had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds (64 kg). Based on the plates&#x27; lighter weight and Stowell&#x27;s description of its corner&#x27;s &quot;greenish cast&quot;, one scholar has hypothesized Smith made the plates from copper, which weighs less than gold and rusts green. LDS writers have speculated the plates could also exhibit those qualities if it were made of a copper-gold alloy like Mesoamerican tumbaga.

===&quot;Sealed&quot; portion===
According to Smith and others, the golden plates contained a &quot;sealed&quot; portion containing &quot;a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.&quot; Smith never described the nature of the seal, and the language of the Book of Mormon may be interpreted to describe a sealing that was spiritual, metaphorical, physical, or a combination of these elements.

The Book of Mormon refers to other documents and plates as being &quot;sealed&quot; to be revealed at some future time. For example, the Book of Mormon says the entire set of plates was &quot;sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord&quot; and that separate records of John the Apostle were &quot;sealed up to come forth in their purity&quot; in the end times. One set of plates to which the Book of Mormon refers was &quot;sealed up&quot; in the sense that they were written in a language that could not be read.

Smith may have understood the sealing to be a supernatural or spiritual sealing &quot;by the power of God&quot; (2 Nephi 27:10), an idea supported by a reference in the Book of Mormon to the &quot;interpreters&quot; with which Smith said they were buried or &quot;sealed.&quot; Oliver Cowdery also stated that when Smith visited the hill, he was stricken by a supernatural force because the plates were &quot;sealed by the prayer of faith.&quot;

Several witnesses described a physical sealing placed on part of the plates by Mormon or Moroni. David Whitmer said that when an angel showed him the plates in 1829, &quot;a large portion of the leaves were so securely bound together that it was impossible to separate them,&quot; that the &quot;sealed&quot; part of the plates were held together as a solid mass &quot;stationary and immovable,&quot; &quot;as solid to my view as wood,&quot; and that there were &quot;perceptible marks where the plates appeared to be sealed&quot; with leaves &quot;so securely bound that it was impossible to separate them.&quot; In 1842, Lucy Mack Smith said that some of the plates were &quot;sealed together&quot; while others were &quot;loose.&quot; The account of the Eight Witnesses says they saw the plates in 1829 and handled &quot;as many of the leaves as Smith has translated,&quot; implying that they did not examine untranslated parts, such as the sealed portion. In one interview, David Whitmer said that &quot;about half&quot; the book was unsealed; in 1881, he said &quot;about one-third&quot; was unsealed. Whitmer&#x27;s 1881 statement is consistent with an 1856 statement by Orson Pratt, an associate of Smith&#x27;s who never saw the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses, that &quot;about two-thirds&quot; of the plates were &quot;sealed up&quot;.

===Engravings===

==Significance in the Latter Day Saint tradition==
The golden plates are the reputed source for the Book of Mormon, which Smith called the &quot;most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion.&quot; However, the golden plates are just one of many known and reputed metal plates with significance in the Latter Day Saint movement. The Book of Mormon itself refers to a long tradition of writing historical records on plates, of which the golden plates are a culmination (see List of plates (Latter Day Saint movement)).

Some Latter Day Saints, especially those within the Community of Christ, have doubted the historicity of the golden plates and downplayed their significance. For most adherents of the Latter Day Saint faith, however, the physical existence and authenticity of the golden plates are essential elements of their faith. For them, the message of the Book of Mormon is inseparable from the story of its origins.

Hugh Nibley, a Latter-day Saint scholar, said in 1957 that he believed even proof of the actual existence of the golden plates would not settle disputes about the Book of Mormon and the story of its origin.

=== Kinderhook plates hoax ===

A few other sets of plates have arisen to prominence in various denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

In 1843, after reading a missionary tract written by Orson Pratt, three men in Kinderhook, Pike County, Illinois – Robert Wiley, Wilburn Fugate, and Bridge Whitton – decided to collaborate to counterfeit a set of metal plates and &quot;startle the natives,&quot; as one of Fugate&#x27;s sons recalled. The trio forged plates from copper, etched them with acid, and buried them in a mound, digging them up on April 23, 1843, in a pretended discovery. The &quot;Quincy Whig&quot; published a story on the discovery, and the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; and &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot;, a publication of the church and of the city respectively, reprinted the story. The Mormon community soon expressed much interest in the plates.

By May 1, the plates had been brought to Nauvoo, and Smith, apparently believing they were authentic, attempted to translate them. Smith&#x27;s private secretary William Clayton recorded that upon receiving the plates, Smith sent for his &quot;Hebrew Bible &amp; Lexicon&quot;, suggesting that rather than translate the plates by direct revelation, Smith attempted to translate the plates by more conventional means. That day, Clayton wrote in his journal:

Scholars examining the Kinderhook plates in retrospect have found that one character coincidentally resembles a character in Smith&#x27;s Egyptian Alphabet Book, the alleged meaning of which matches Smith&#x27;s attempted translation of the Kinderhook plates, further suggesting Smith tried to translate the plates as an amateur linguist.

Apostles John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff, editors of the &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot;, anticipated Smith would translate the plates in their entirety and promised in a June 1843 article that &quot;The contents of the plates, together with a Fac-simile of the same, will be published in the &#x27;Times and Seasons,&#x27; as soon as the translation is completed.&quot; However, the plates were returned untranslated to Wiley and Fugate in Kinderhook. Smith did not express reservations about the plates to any of his compatriots, but whether or not he recognized the Kinderhook plates as fraudulent, &quot;he did not swing into a full-fledged translation&quot; as he had with his earlier encounter with Egyptian scrolls.

In 1886, a signed letter from Fugate was published in the book &quot;Joseph Smith the Prophet, His Family and His Friends: A Study Based on Facts and Documents&quot;, and in the letter Fugate revealed the hoax and the fabrication of the plates. Nevertheless, many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (a denomination of Mormons who followed Brigham Young after Smith&#x27;s death) refused to accept Fugate&#x27;s confession and defended the Kinderhook plates as authentic and Smith&#x27;s translation as legitimate until 1980, when Northwestern University materials science professor D. Lynn Johnson examined a plate still held by the Chicago Historical Society and conclusively proved it was a nineteenth-century creation.

=== Strangite plates ===
Two other sets of alleged plates, the Voree plates and the Book of the Law of the Lord, were translated by James Strang – one of three major contenders to succeed Smith – who went on to lead the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite). The Voree plates were alleged to have been written by an ancient inhabitant of what is now Burlington, Wisconsin, while the Book of the Law of the Lord was alleged by Strang to be a translation of the Plates of Laban mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Neither of these alleged discoveries by Strang is accepted as authentic outside of the Strangite community.

==Mainstream views==
Mainstream scholarship regards the Book of Mormon as an ahistorical 19th-century creation and rejects Smith&#x27;s claim to have possessed golden plates.

===Visionary witnesses===
Smith and his peers were practitioners of folk magic, including scrying, second sight, and divination. Joseph Smith reportedly guided local seer Samuel T. Lawrence to the hill, where the two used a seer stone to view the golden plates; Lawrence reportedly was the first to see a pair of spectacles in addition to the plates.

Oliver Cowdrey, one of the Three Witnesses, was a distant relative of Joseph Smith who also engaged in divination. Cowdery reported that his first witness of the golden plates was in a vision before the he and Smith had ever met. In 1838, Cowdrey broke with Smith, accusing him of a &quot;dirty, nasty, filthy affair&quot; with Fanny Alger. David Whitmer, a friend of Cowdery, similarly reported visions and owned a seer stone.

Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses to the golden plates, described his witness as a visionary experience. John Gilbert, printer of the first edition of the Book of Mormon, recalled asking Harris if he saw the plates with his naked eyes, to which Harries replied &quot;No, I saw them with a spiritual eye&quot;.

In 1837, Harris and others accused the Kirtland Safety Society bank of fraud. In December 1837, Smith and the Kirtland High Council excommunicated 28 individuals, Harris among them. In 1838, Smith called the Three Witnesses (Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer) &quot;too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.&quot; Parrish&#x27;s church in Kirtland took control of the temple and became known as &quot;The Church of Christ&quot;. In 1838, Harris publicly admitted that &quot;he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination.&quot; Harris publicly denied that any of the Witnesses to the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; had ever seen or handled the golden plates. Harris&#x27;s statement reportedly induced five influential members, including three apostles, to leave the church. In the 1870s, Harris again gave an interview where he admitted &quot;I never saw the golden plates, only in a visionary or entranced state.&quot; 

===Sham plates hypothesis===
Multiple witnesses reported touching a set of plates covered in cloth. Scholar Dan Vogel has argued that Smith may have constructed a set of plates, out of tin or similar metal, that could be hefted but could not pass visual inspection. In 2021, John Dehlin&#x27;s Mormon Stories Podcast documented the creation of a set of tin plates using 19th-century tools in two hours.

<text>Michael Bilirakis (born July 16, 1930) is an American politician and lawyer from Florida. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2007, representing Florida&#x27;s 9th congressional district.

==Early life==
The son of Greek immigrants, Bilirakis was born in Tarpon Springs, Florida but spent his childhood in Clairton, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Douglas Business College in McKeesport, Pennsylvania in 1949. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1959 where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He also attended George Washington University in 1960. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Florida Levin College of Law in 1963. Bilirakis served in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1955 during the Korean War era and rose to the rank of staff sergeant.

==Political career==
Bilirakis made his first run for office in 1982, contesting the newly created 9th District. He defeated State Representative George Sheldon by 4,300 votes. He was reelected with 78 percent of the vote in 1984 and was reelected 10 more times, never facing serious opposition. He ran unopposed in 1988, 1994, 1998 and 2004.

His committee assignments include membership on the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as being vice chairman of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee. He played a key role in enactment of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act and re-authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. He was the lead congressional sponsor of The Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 and authored the Organ Donation Improvement Act. &quot;National Journal&quot;&#x27;s Almanac of American Politics called him one of the most &quot;legislatively productive&quot; members of Congress.

===Retirement and later life===
Bilirakis retired in 2006. His son, Gus, a Florida state representative, defeated Democrat Phyllis Busansky in the 2006 congressional race for the elder Bilirakis&#x27;s House seat. In August 2009, Bilirakis was shortlisted by Governor Crist as a potential replacement for Mel Martínez after his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Crist ultimately appointed George LeMieux.

<text>George Fisher (8 April 1923 – 15 December 2003) was an American political cartoonist.

==Early life==
George Fisher was born just outside of Searcy, Arkansas, on 8 April 1923, the son of Charles W. and Gladys Fisher. George&#x27;s father was born in Tennessee and was a home builder and business owner. Fisher&#x27;s mother died when he was 5 years old and his father never remarried. Fisher&#x27;s father encouraged George&#x27;s artistic ability and suggested political subjects for him to draw. Fisher had his first cartoon published in 1944 lampooning Arkansas governor Homer Martin Adkins for claiming credit for wartime factory construction in Arkansas.

==Education and Participation in War==
Fisher attended Beebe College for one year, after which he withdrew to join the United States Army. Fisher entered the service on June 6, 1943, under the branch of Cannon Co. 417th Infantry, 76th Division. He trained at Camp Roberts (California) and Camp McCoy (Wisconsin) and was engaged in the Argonne Forest, Rhineland and Central Europe. Fisher reached the rank of Staff Sergeant before his discharge on April 8, 1946, as well as a Bronze Star. Fisher served in Europe as an infantryman and participated in the Battle of the Bulge. While in service, Fisher kept a daily cartoon diary of his experiences and drew cartoons for his regimental newspaper.

While stationed in Bournemouth, England Fisher met a female artist named Rosemary Snook. After the war, Fisher married Snook and began hiding her nickname, &quot;Snooky&quot;, into most of his cartoons. Finding the hidden nickname became a favorite game for those who read his cartoons regularly.

==Career==
At the conclusion of the war, Fisher returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, and began drawing cartoons for the &quot;West Memphis News&quot;. The newspaper was run by former soldiers who had returned from the war and determined to stand up to the political machine that controlled local and statewide politics at the time. Fisher worked for the newspaper until it was forced to close.

Fisher moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, and started doing commercial art work for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. With the advent of television, Fisher and his wife sought out a job at the local ABC affiliate KATV and established a syndicated puppet show called &quot;Phydeaux and His Friends&quot; which specialized in political satire. Local political figures, including Governor Orval Faubus, made guest appearances on the show.

Fisher convinced the weekly &quot;North Little Rock Times&quot; to start carrying his political cartoons and, before long, other newspapers began reprinting them in their Sunday editions.

In 1972, Fisher began drawing cartoons twice per week for the statewide &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; and became the newspaper&#x27;s official cartoonist in 1976. Fisher gained a very active following in the state of Arkansas and became an Arkansas institution. Fisher&#x27;s work was never syndicated, because he preferred to focus mostly on affairs in his home state, but many of his cartoons were reprinted nationally.

==Death==
Fisher died of a Heart Attack on 15 December 2003 at his home after completing a Christmas cartoon for the &quot;Arkansas Times&quot;.

His wife died in 1983, but Fisher continued to hide her nickname in his cartoons as a tribute.

Fisher&#x27;s most famous statewide cartoon was a drawing of Governor Orval Faubus addressing a session of the Arkansas legislature where everyone present, even the mice and statues, had the face of Orval Faubus.

His most famous nationally reprinted cartoon was on the occasion of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.

His work has been published in several anthologies and he has been acclaimed as one of the great cartoonists of the 20th century.

Fisher was buried at Beebe Cemetery in Beebe, Arkansas.

<doc id="410991" wikidata="Q1973610" url="?curid=410991" title="Epididymis">
<text>The epididymis (; : epididymides or ) is an elongated tubular genital organ attached to the posterior side of each one of the two male reproductive glands, the testicles. It is a single, narrow, tightly coiled tube in adult humans, in length; uncoiled the tube would be approximately 6 m (20 feet) long. It connects the testicle to the vas deferens in the male reproductive system. The epididymis serves as an interconnection between the multiple efferent ducts at the rear of a testicle (proximally), and the vas deferens (distally). Its primary function is the storage, maturation and transport of sperm cells.

==Structure==
The human epididymis is situated posterior and somewhat lateral to the testis. The epididymis is invested completely by the tunica vaginalis (which is continuous with the tunica vaginalis covering the testis).

The epididymis can be divided into three main regions:
* The head (). The head of the epididymis receives spermatozoa via the efferent ducts of the mediastinium of the testis at the superior pole of the testis. The head is characterized histologically by a thick epithelium with long stereocilia (described below) and a little smooth muscle. It is involved in absorbing fluid to make the sperm more concentrated. The concentration of the sperm here is dilute.
* The body (). This has an intermediate epithelium and smooth muscle thickness.
* The tail (). This has the thinnest epithelium of the three regions and the greatest quantity of smooth muscle. The tail is distally continuous with (the convoluted portion of) the ductus deferens (s. vas deferens).

== Histology ==
The epididymis is covered by a two layered pseudostratified epithelium. The epithelium is separated by a basement membrane from the connective tissue wall which has smooth muscle cells. The major cell types in the epithelium are:
* Principal cells: columnar cells that, with the basal cells, form the majority of the epithelium. In the caput (head) region these cells have long stereocilia that are tuft-like extensions that project into the lumen. The stereocilia are much shorter in the cauda (tail) segment. They also secrete carnitine, sialic acid, glycoproteins, and glycerylphosphorylcholine into the lumen.
* Basal cells: shorter, pyramid-shaped cells, which contact the basal lamina but taper off before their apical surfaces reach the lumen. These are thought to be undifferentiated precursors of principal cells.
* Apical cells: predominantly found in the head region
* Clear cells: predominant in the tail region
* Intraepithelial lymphocytes: distributed throughout the tissue.
* Intraepithelial macrophages

=== Stereocilia ===
The stereocilia of the epididymis are long cytoplasmic projections that have an actin filament backbone. These filaments have been visualized at high resolution using fluorescent phalloidin that binds to actin filaments.
The stereocilia in the epididymis are non-motile. These membrane extensions increase the surface area of the cell, allowing for greater absorption and secretion. It has been shown that epithelial sodium channel ENaC that allows the flow of Na+ ions into the cell is localized on stereocilia.

Because sperm are initially non-motile as they leave the seminiferous tubules, large volumes of fluid are secreted to propel them to the epididymis. The core function of the stereocilia is to resorb 90% of this fluid as the spermatozoa start to become motile. This absorption creates a fluid current that moves the immobile sperm from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis. Spermatozoa only reach full motility when inside a vagina, where the alkaline pH is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.

== Development ==
In the embryo, the epididymis develops from tissue that once formed the mesonephros, a primitive kidney found in many aquatic vertebrates. Persistence of the cranial end of the mesonephric duct will leave behind a remnant called the &quot;appendix of the epididymis&quot;. In addition, some mesonephric tubules can persist as the &quot;paradidymis&quot;, a small body caudal to the efferent ductules.

The epoophoron is a homologous remnant in the female.

==Function==

===Role in storage of sperm and ejaculant===
Spermatozoa formed in the testis enter the caput epididymidis, progress to the corpus, and finally reach the cauda region, where they are stored. Sperm entering the caput epididymidis are incomplete—they lack the ability to swim forward (motility) and to fertilize an egg. Epididymal transit takes 2 to 6 days in humans and 10–13 in rodents. During their transit in the epididymis, sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire motility and fertility. Final maturation (&quot;capacitation&quot;) is completed in the female reproductive tract.
The epididymis secretes immobilin, a large glycoprotein that is responsible for the creating of the viscoelastic luminal environment that serves to mechanically immobilize spermatozoa until ejaculation. Immobilin is predominantly secreted into the proximal caput epididymidis prior to the acquisition of the potential for sperm motility.

During emission, sperm flow from the &quot;cauda epididymis&quot; (which functions as a storage reservoir) into the vas deferens where they are propelled by the peristaltic action of muscle layers in the wall of the vas deferens, and are mixed with the diluting fluids of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and other accessory glands prior to ejaculation (forming semen).

Contrary to popular belief, sperm are capable of causing a pregnancy even without ever travelling through the epididymis. This has been proven in two cases in the United States in the 1980s where a couple of men&#x27;s vasa deferentia were directly surgically attached to their efferent ducts and these men both subsequently impregnated their partners within the next couple of years. This has also been proven in a similar case in Western Europe in the early 1990s.

===Antioxidant defenses===

During their transit through the epididymis, the spermatozoa undergo a series of transformations in preparation for their ultimate task of fertilizing the oocyte. In order to protect the spermatozoa during their transit through the epididymis, the epididymal epithelium produces a variety of antioxidant proteins that help protect the spermatozoa from oxidative damage. The antioxidant proteins produced include catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione-S-transferases, peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxins. Deficiencies in the availability of these antioxidant proteins reduces sperm quality by affecting a variety of the proteins necessary for the motility needed to fertilize oocytes. Reduced antioxidant activity also causes increased oxidative damage to the sperm DNA.

==Clinical significance==

===Inflammation===
An inflammation of the epididymis is called epididymitis. It is much more common than testicular inflammation, termed orchitis.

===Surgical removal===
Epididymotomy is the placing of an incision into the epididymis and is sometimes considered as a treatment option for acute suppurating epididymitis.

Epididymectomy is the surgical removal of the epididymis sometimes performed for post-vasectomy pain syndrome and for refractory cases of epididymitis.

Epididymectomy is also performed for sterilization on some male animals of livestock species so they can be used to detect estrus in females ready for artificial insemination.

== Other animals ==
The epididymis is present in male reptiles, birds, mammals, and cartilaginous fish. The caput epididymidis is fused to the testis in eutherian mammals, but not in marsupials.

In reptiles, there is an additional canal between the testis and the head of the epididymis and which receives the various efferent ducts. This is, however, absent in all birds and mammals.

<text>Charles William Young (December 16, 1930 – October 18, 2013) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 until his death in 2013. A Republican from Florida, Young served as chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations from 1999 to 2005. He was the longest-serving Republican member of Congress at the time of his death.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Young was born in Harmarville, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, in 1930. He had Irish, German, and Swiss ancestry. He grew up in a Pennsylvania coal town in a shotgun shack. His father abandoned the family and a flood washed away their home at age 6. An uncle had a hunting camp in Florida, so the family moved there when he was 16. Young dropped out of St. Petersburg High School to support his ill mother, Wilma M. (Hulings) Young, and was wounded in a hunting accident. He married Marian Ford on August 20, 1949, when he was an 18-year-old high school dropout and she was 17, entering her senior year at St. Petersburg High School. When he was 18, he joined the Army National Guard and served from 1948 to 1957. After finishing his service, he applied for a job as an insurance salesman and ultimately ran an insurance agency.

==Florida Senate==

In 1960 Young was elected to the Florida Senate, where he served from 1961 to 1970, and was minority leader in that chamber from 1966 to 1970. Until 1963, Young was the only Republican in Florida&#x27;s upper chamber.

From 1962 through 1964, Young served on the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, commonly known as the Johns Committee (for its Chairman Charley Eugene Johns), a legislative panel that investigated the activities of homosexuals, communists and others thought to be subversive. In 1964, the committee released a pamphlet entitled &quot;Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida&quot;, which drew criticism at the time for its use of explicit photographs of homosexual acts. At the time, Young said of homosexuality: &quot;Our report tried to show it in its true light – it&#x27;s a very repulsive subject.&quot; Responding to reports that reprints of the pamphlet were being sold as pornography for a gay audience, Young said: &quot;This indicates how bold the homosexual is becoming and further proves the necessity of state government taking the lead in responsibility for preventing these confirmed homosexuals from preying on the youth of the state.&quot; In 1993, Young was asked about his involvement with the report by the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; and said: &quot;I am not supportive of homosexuality, but that&#x27;s the decision of the people who are involved in it. If someone wants to engage in that sort of behavior, that&#x27;s their choice.&quot; Young also stated that the committee was largely inactive during his tenure due to the illness of its chair, Charley Eugene Johns, and that he was not involved enough in the committee to be either proud or regretful of its work.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

Young was elected to Congress in 1970 from what was then the 8th District and was reelected 20 times. With the exception of his first term, he represented a district located almost entirely in Pinellas County. The district, which changed numbers four times during Young&#x27;s tenure (it was the 8th District from 1971 to 1973, the 6th District from 1973 to 1983, the 8th District again from 1983 to 1993, the 10th from 1993 to 2013 and has been the 13th since 2013) was once considered a Republican stronghold; the St. Petersburg area had been one of the first parts of Florida to turn Republican. However, it has become much friendlier to Democratic candidates in recent years, at least on the national level. Since 1988, it has supported a Republican for president only once, in 2004. Despite the Democratic trend in his district at the national level, Young remained popular, and rarely faced serious opposition. He only twice received less than 60% of the vote, in 1992 and 2012.

===Tenure===
Young was a member of the Appropriations Committee for his entire time in Congress, and was able to use that seat to steer millions of federal dollars to his district. His earmarks have been used for U.S. Highway 19, high tech jobs, healthcare for children, clean water, and defense contractors. This was a major reason why he was able to hold onto his seat for so long even as it became friendlier to Democrats at the national level. It is considered extremely difficult to defeat an Appropriations Committee member at an election, especially if the member is a subcommittee chairman (&quot;Cardinal&quot;) or the chairman of the full committee.

====1970s====
In 1974, all four Republican congressmen from Florida said they would support impeaching President Richard Nixon over the Watergate Scandal.

In the 1976 Republican primary for president, Young endorsed President Gerald Ford over California Governor Ronald Reagan.

====1980s====
In 1980, Young endorsed moderate George H. W. Bush over Ronald Reagan in the Republican primary.

Young opposed any spending cuts to the United States Coast Guard. He strongly opposed deficit reduction.

He was instrumental in creating a national registry for bone marrow donors in 1986. Now named after him, it lists nearly 10 million volunteer donors and has facilitated transplants for more than 50,000 people.

====1990s====
After the 1994 Republican Revolution, House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave the position of chairman of the Appropriations Committee to Bob Livingston of Louisiana instead of Young, even though Young had more seniority. When Dennis Hastert became speaker in 1999, Young finally became the chairman.

Young strongly supported increases in defense spending and sent letters to Congressman John Kasich, Chairman of the Budget Committee, recommending an increase in DOD funding. Young strongly supported the F-22 Raptor.

In a 1999 &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview, Young stated, &quot;In my short life I&#x27;ve been shot, I&#x27;ve been hit by a truck, survived an airplane crash, I&#x27;ve had my chest opened and my heart rebuilt. And it&#x27;s sort of hard to get me flustered after all that.&quot;

====2000s====
In 2005, Young received 3,570 earmark requests from members of Congress, because it was his last year as chairman of the committee. He believed that requests for earmarks should not be publicly disclosed. In March 2006, Young spokesman Harry Glenn said &quot;This has been the policy of the committee for years. It&#x27;s internal correspondence from one member to another.&quot; From 2007 to 2008, $167 million in earmarked funds came to the Tampa Bay Area.
At the State of the Union Address on January 31, 2006, authorities expressly prohibited the display of political ideology on clothing in the U.S. Capitol. Young&#x27;s wife was asked to leave shortly after anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan was ejected for wearing an anti-war T-shirt. Beverly Young&#x27;s T-shirt stated: &quot;Support the Troops — Defending Our Freedom.&quot; She argued with Capitol Hill Police officers in the hallway outside the House chamber. &quot;They said I was protesting,&quot; she told the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;. &quot;I said, &#x27;Read my shirt, it is not a protest.&#x27; They said, &#x27;We consider that a protest.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Then you are an idiot.&#x27;&quot; Young was angry about the way his wife was treated. &quot;Because she had on a shirt that someone didn&#x27;t like that said support our troops, she was kicked out of this gallery,&quot; Young said on the House floor the following day, holding up the gray shirt. &quot;Shame, shame,&quot; he said. Capitol Police Chief Terrance Gainer apologized in a statement late that same day. Young said he was not necessarily satisfied. &quot;My wife was humiliated,&quot; he told reporters. He suggested that &quot;sensitivity training&quot; might be in order for the Capitol Police.

On September 29, 2008, Young voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

Young supported over $70 million in combined earmarks to two companies that employed his sons, both before and after they were employees. Young&#x27;s son, Patrick, was hired by defense contractor SAIC when the company received earmarks requested by Young.

In 2009 Young signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.

In 2011, Young resisted a request by the Pentagon to transfer $863 million in funds from Humvee production to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for the conflict in Afghanistan. AM General, which makes the Humvee, has been a contributor to Young&#x27;s campaigns. Young denied that his actions &quot;put American lives at risk&quot;, pointing to an urgent Marine Corps request to improve crew protection on existing Humvees as reason enough to preserve some funding for additional vehicles beyond armed forces requirements. Nonetheless, Young&#x27;s committee approved $613 million of the Humvee funds to buy equipment for Afghanistan.

After eleven years of supporting the Afghanistan wars, Young turned against the war in 2012 after Army Staff Sgt. Matthew S. Sitton of Largo was killed in Afghanistan after sending Young a letter pointing out problems there and predicting his own death. Young&#x27;s wife had also been trying to persuade her husband to oppose continued American involvement in Afghanistan. Young said &quot;we&#x27;re killing kids who don&#x27;t need to die.&quot;

On October 9, 2013, Young announced he would not seek re-election in 2014.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Defense (chairman)
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
Young received a term limit waiver to retain his chairmanship of the Appropriations Subcommittee for the 113th Congress. House Republicans limit committee chairmen to a six-year term, but Young received two consecutive waivers extending this limit.

===Caucus memberships===
* Army Caucus
* Congressional Diabetes Caucus
* Congressional Fire Services Caucus
* Congressional Human Rights Caucus
* Congressional Social Security Caucus (Co-chair)
* Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus
* International Conservation Caucus
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus

==Electoral history==




==Other activities==
Young served as a member of the Florida Constitution Revision Commission from 1965 to 1967. He was also a Florida delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984.

==Personal life==
Young married Marian Ford on August 20, 1949, when he was an 18-year-old high school dropout and she was 17, entering her senior year at St. Petersburg High School. They had three children: Terry, Pamela, and Kimber. In 1985, after 36 years of marriage, Young divorced Marian. As part of the divorce agreement, Marian received $2,000 per month in alimony in exchange for agreeing to seal the divorce records and not speaking publicly about it during Young&#x27;s lifetime. Eight days after the divorce became final, Young married Beverly Angello, who had worked as a secretary in his congressional office and was 25 years his junior. Young and Beverly had two children together: Charles William &quot;Billy&quot; (who was born in 1984, while Young was still married to Marian) and Patrick, in addition to Beverly&#x27;s son, Robbie, from her first marriage.

On October 18, 2013, nine days after announcing his retirement, Young died at Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland at the age of 82. He had been hospitalized for almost two weeks after suffering a broken hip and fractured pelvis. Doctors could not perform hip surgery because of brittle bones caused by multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that forms in bone marrow.

On January 6, 2014, Marian Young and the three children from his first marriage spoke out for the first time since Young&#x27;s death. Marian said that her lawyer had specifically asked her to keep silent about her husband&#x27;s affair with Beverly due to concerns that he would lose his congressional seat. Even though the divorce records were sealed, many journalists at the time &quot;knew about the affair and the [extramarital child&#x27;s] birth, but believed such issues fell outside the public&#x27;s right to know.&quot; Terry, Pamela and Kimber also claimed that they had only heard from their father sporadically in the three decades following the divorce.

<text>Stovepipe Wells is a way-station in the northern part of Death Valley, in unincorporated Inyo County, California.

==Geography and names==
Stovepipe Wells is located at and is US Geological Survey (USGS) feature ID 235564. It is entirely inside Death Valley National Park and along State Route 190 (SR 190) at less than above sea level. West on SR 190 is Towne Pass at about above sea level. Eventually, the road meets Panamint Valley Road at Panamint Junction in the Panamint Valley. East on SR 190 the road leads to Furnace Creek and Death Valley Junction.

Variant names listed for the Inyo County location by USGS include Stove Pipe Wells Hotel and Stovepipe Wells Hotel. The US Postal Service ZIP Code is 92328, and the locale name is spelled &quot;Stove Pipe Wells&quot; in some postal renditions. It is commonly referred to as Stovepipe Wells Village.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Stovepipe Wells has a hot desert climate, abbreviated &quot;BWh&quot; on climate maps. Its average high temperature is greater than from June through September.

==History==
The first temporary settlement at Stovepipe Wells came into being when a road between Rhyolite and Skidoo was begun in 1906 to ameliorate the approach to the mine at Skidoo. A collection of tents was erected to serve travelers with food, drink and lodging. During the bonanza days of Rhyolite and Skidoo, it was the only known water source on the Cross-Valley road. When sand obscured the spot, a length of stovepipe was inserted as a marker; hence, its unique name.

In 1925, entrepreneur Bob Eichmann began construction of the hotel at Stovepipe Wells, along with a scenic toll road through Death Valley. This marked the beginning of the transition from mining community to tourist destination.

The settlement is now registered as California Historical Landmark #826.

==Facilities==
Stovepipe Wells Village is home to the Stovepipe Wells Hotel, a full-service hotel with swimming pool. A general store offers sundries and food and is adjacent to a gas station. Stovepipe Wells Village also houses the Badwater Saloon and Toll Road restaurant, The Nugget Gift Shop and a ranger station.

The default format for wired telephone numbers in the community is in the Death Valley exchange: (760) 786-xxxx. The community had manual telephone service until the late 1980s.

The community is contained within the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District.

==Nearby features==

* Close to town are some fairly large and accessible stationary sand dunes on the floor of Death Valley. The dunes are roughly long in the east–west axis. They are located in the space between Salt Creek and Emigrant Wash.
* &quot;Stovepipe Well&quot;, for which the community is named, is shown to the northeast at .
* &quot;Stovepipe Wells Airport&quot; is to the southwest at . The airport has an identifier of L09 and features a paved runway.

==California Historical Landmarks==
There are three California Historical Landmarks in Stovepipe Wells.

California Historical Landmark number 826, Old Stovepipe Wells, founded on August 7, 1968, reads:
:&quot;NO. 826 OLD STOVEPIPE WELLS - This waterhole, the only one in the sand dune area of Death Valley, was at the junction of the two Indian trails. During the bonanza days of Rhyolite and Skidoo, it was the only known water source on the cross-valley road. When sand obscured the spot, a length of stovepipe was inserted as a marker.&quot;

California Historical Landmark number 848, Eichbaum Toll Road, founded on May 19, 1971, reads:
:&quot;NO. 848 EICHBAUM TOLL ROAD - In 1926, H. W. Eichbaum obtained a franchise for a toll road from Darwin Falls to Stovepipe Wells, the first maintained road into Death Valley from the west. It changed the area&#x27;s economic base from mining to tourism and brought about the creation of Death Valley National Monument seven years later&quot;

California Historical Landmark number 441, Burned Wagons Point, founded on October 24, 1949, reads:
:&quot;NO. 441 BURNED WAGONS POINT - Near this monument, the Jayhawker group of Death Valley &#x27;49ers, gold seekers from the Middle West who entered Death Valley in 1849 seeking a short route to the mines of central California, burned their wagons, dried the meat of some oxen and, with surviving animals, struggled westward on foot.&quot;

<doc id="410999" wikidata="Q735505" url="?curid=410999" title="Vas deferens">
<text>The vas deferens (: vasa deferentia), ductus deferens (: ductūs deferentes), or sperm duct is part of the male reproductive system of many vertebrates. In mammals, spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules and flow into the epididymal duct. The end of the epididymis is connected to the vas deferens. The vas deferens ends with an opening into the ejaculatory duct at a point where the duct of the seminal vesicle also joins the ejaculatory duct.
The vas deferens is a partially coiled tube which exits the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.

==Etymology==
&quot;Vas deferens&quot; is Latin, meaning &quot;carrying-away vessel&quot; while &quot;ductus deferens&quot;, also Latin, means &quot;carrying-away duct&quot;.

==Structure==
The human vas deferens measures 30–35 cm in length, and 2–3 mm in diameter. It is continuous proximally with the tail of the epididymis, and exhibits a tortuous, convoluted initial/proximal section (which measures 2–3 cm in length). Distally, it forms a dilated and tortuous segment termed the ampulla of vas deferens before ending by uniting with a duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct. Together they form part of the spermatic cord.

===Blood supply===
The vasa deferentia are supplied with blood by accompanying arteries, the (arteries of vas deferens). These arteries normally arises from the superior (sometimes inferior) vesical arteries, a branch of the internal iliac arteries.

=== Innervation ===
The vas deferens receives innervation from an autonomic plexus of post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres derived from the inferior hypogastric plexus.

It is innervated by a variety of nerve endings, although of the efferent nerves the sympathetic innveration dominates. Adrenergic junctions (those which release noradrenaline) are found in the smooth muscle layers. Cholinergic synapses and vasoactive intestinal peptide synapses are found in the connective tissue of the mucosa.

=== Anatomical relations ===
Within the spermatic cord, the vas deferens is situated posterior (and parallel to) the vessels of the spermatic cord.

The vas deferens traverses the inguinal canal to reach the pelvic cavity; it enters the pelvic cavity lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. At the deep inguinal ring, the vas deferens diverges from the testicular vessels to pass medially to reach the base of the prostate posteriorly.

== Histology ==
The vas deferens consists of an external adventitial sheath containing blood vessels and nerves, a muscular middle layer composed of three layers of smooth muscle (with a circular muscle layer interposed between two longitudinal muscle layers), and an internal mucosal lining consisting of pseudostratified columnar epithelium (which bears the non-motile stereocilia).

The vas deferens has the greatest muscle-to-lumen ratio of any hollow organ.

==Function==
During ejaculation, the smooth muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, thus propelling the sperm forward. This is also known as peristalsis. The epithelial sodium channel ENaC is strongly expressed in smooth muscle cells of the vas deferens. It has been suggested that ENaC functions as a mechanosensor in vascular smooth muscle cells that initiate pressure‐induced constriction known as the &quot;myogenic response&quot;. Ion channels ENaC and CFTR, aquaporin of type AQP9 are localized on the apical border of the epithelia. Thus, these channels are involved concurrently in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance in the lumen of the vas deferens.

The sperm are transferred from each vas deferens into the urethra, partially mixing with secretions from the male accessory sex glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and the bulbourethral glands, which form the bulk of semen.

==Clinical significance==
Damage to the vas deferens during inguinal hernia repair may cause infertility.

===Contraception===
A vasectomy is a method of contraception in which the vasa deferentia are permanently cut. In some cases, it can be reversed. A modern variation, vas-occlusive contraception, involves injecting an obstructive material into the ductus to block the flow of sperm.

===Disease===
The vas deferens may be obstructed, or it may be completely absent in a condition known as congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD, a potential feature of cystic fibrosis), causing male infertility. Acquired obstructions can occur due to infections. To treat these causes of male infertility, sperm can be harvested by testicular sperm extraction (TESE) or microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA).

==Uses in pharmacology and physiology==
The vas deferens has a dense sympathetic innervation, making it a useful system for studying sympathetic nerve function and for studying drugs that modify neurotransmission.

It has been used:
* as a bioassay for the discovery of enkephalins, the endogenous opiates.
* to demonstrate quantal transmission from sympathetic nerve terminals.
* as the first direct measure of free Ca2+ concentration in a postganglionic nerve terminal.
* to develop an optical method for monitoring packeted transmission (similar to quantal transmission).

==Other animals==
Most vertebrates have some form of duct to transfer the sperm from the testes to the urethra. In cartilaginous fish and amphibians, sperm are carried through the archinephric duct, which also partially helps to transport urine from the kidneys. In teleosts, there is a distinct sperm duct, separate from the ureters, and often called the vas deferens, although probably not truly homologous with that in humans. The vas deferens loops over the ureter in placental mammals, but not in marsupial mammals.

In cartilaginous fishes, the part of the archinephric duct closest to the testis is coiled up to form an epididymis. Below this are a number of small glands secreting components of the seminal fluid. The final portion of the duct also receives ducts from the kidneys in most species.

In amniotes (mammals, birds, and reptiles), the archinephric duct has become a true vas deferens, and is used only for conducting sperm, never urine. As in cartilaginous fish, the upper part of the duct forms the epididymis. In many species, the vas deferens ends in a small sac for storing sperm.

The only vertebrates to lack any structure resembling a vas deferens are the primitive jawless fishes, which release sperm directly into the body cavity, and then into the surrounding water through a simple opening in the body wall.

<doc id="411001" wikidata="Q871527" url="?curid=411001" title="American pipit">
<text>The American pipit (Anthus rubescens), formerly known as the buff-bellied pipit, is a small songbird native to North America. It was first described by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot;. It was formerly classified as a form of the water pipit. The former subspecies, Siberian pipit, is now considered a distinct species.

==Description==
Like most other pipits, the American pipit is an undistinguished-looking species which usually can be seen to run around on the ground. It has lightly streaked grey-brown upperparts and is diffusely streaked below on the buff breast and flanks. The belly is whitish, the bill and legs are dark. The related Siberian pipit is darker above and has bolder black streaking on its whiter underparts; its legs have a reddish hue. The call is a squeaky &quot;sip&quot;.

Measurements:

* Length: 16 cm 
* Weight: 22 g 
* Wingspan: 24 cm

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name is from Latin. &quot;Anthus&quot; is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific &quot;rubescens&quot; means &quot;reddish&quot;, from
&quot;ruber&quot;, &quot;ruddy&quot;.

Three subspecies are currently recognized:
* &quot;A. r. rubescens&quot; - , – breeds in northern Canada east to Greenland and northeast United States, wintering in Central America
*&quot;A. r. pacificus -&quot; Breeds in Pacific Cordillera from Alaska to Oregon, wintering in western Mexico. Birds breeding in south Alaska have sometimes been recognized as a distinct subspecies &quot;A. r. geophilus.&quot; 
*&quot;A. r. alticola -&quot; Breeds in the Rocky Mountains from southern British Columbia to California, wintering in Mexico

This species is closely related to European rock pipit (&quot;A. petrosus&quot;) and water pipit (&quot;A. spinoletta&quot;), all three forms having previously been considered conspecific. They can be differentiated by their vocalizations and some visual cues, but rock and American pipit are not found sympatrically except as vagrant individuals.
==Behavior==
All subspecies of the American pipit are migratory. The American pipit winters on the Pacific coast of North America, and on the Atlantic coast from the southern North America to Central America. At least regarding the American pipit, its wintering range seems to have expanded northwards in the 20th century and the birds seem to spend less time in winter quarters: in northern Ohio, for example, the species was recorded as &quot;not common&quot; during migration in May and September/October in the 1900s (decade), but today it is considered a &quot;widespread migrant&quot; in that region, found between March and May and from late September to November, with many birds actually wintering this far north. The American pipit is a rare vagrant to Western.

Like its relatives, this species is insectivorous. The breeding habitat of American pipit is tundra, but outside the breeding season it is found in open lightly vegetated areas, similar to those favoured by the water pipit (&quot;A. spinoletta&quot;).

==Reproduction: from pairing to fledging==

The first thing American pipits do when they arrive on the breeding site, during snowmelt, is pairing. Indeed, males will start to fight one on one to win over the female and pair with it during the entire breeding season. They also fight for the snow-free sites that would be better for nesting. The moment is also very important because the melting snow implies an increase in arthropods abundance, which constitute the main food source for these birds. After the fight and the pairing, nesting is the next step. Nests are most often found on the ground in dry or wet meadows, always with a helpful protection, but they are never placed in shrubs or trees. The composition of the ideal nest depends on whatever is around the nesting area, but it is usually made of sedge, remains or new fine grass, and sometimes some horse hairs. The final issue buff-bellied pipits have to deal with is nest success. The nest is indeed the target for numerous predators such as ants or hawks. If this step is successful, an egg can be produced. The female will not lay an egg if the conditions, such as temperature and nesting site, are not optimal. If the first attempt fails, her time to lay an egg is reduced. In general, American pipits continuously lay eggs over a period of 4 to 5 days after snow-melt (in April–May) until mid-July. After this period, the male testes decrease in size and the female refuses any copulation. The clutch size is usually 5 eggs but it can vary according to snowfalls, the parents&#x27; reproductive ability and predation. Eggs are incubated for 13–14 days. During this time, the female does not leave the nest, but is still very reactive to any movement around her. She communicates by singing to the male that brings her food and defends their territory. Four or five days after hatching, the young is skinny, blue-gray in color, and only has its secondary feathers. For a week, the female will brood the clutch, but both parents will feed them. After these 7 days, the birds are ready for fledging but they will still be fed by their parents for 14 days after their departure. Finally, immature birds will form little flocks with other immature birds and wander off.

==Status==
It is a widespread and common species and not considered threatened by the IUCN.

<doc id="411002" wikidata="Q1266083" url="?curid=411002" title="Lenny Kaye">
<text>Lenny Kaye (&quot;né&quot; Kusikoff; born December 27, 1946) is an American guitarist, composer, and writer, notable for his work with the Patti Smith Group, his contributions to music magazines, and his garage rock retrospective anthology &quot;&quot;.

== Early life and education==
Kaye was born to Jewish parents in the Washington Heights area of Upper Manhattan, New York City. His father changed the family name from Kusikoff to Kaye when Lenny was one-year old. He grew up in Queens and Brooklyn.

He played the accordion, but by the end of the 1950s had dropped the instrument in favor of collecting records. In 1960, his family moved to North Brunswick, New Jersey, where Kaye attended high school. He participated in science fiction fandom and gained experience in writing, publishing his own science fiction fanzine, &quot;Obelisk&quot;, at the age of 15. His personal collection of fanzines later formed the foundation of the Lenny Kaye Science Fiction Fanzine Library at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

In 1967, he graduated from Rutgers University, where he majored in American history. During college he had begun playing in bands, on a college mixer and fraternity circuit. His first gig was with the Vandals at Alpha Sigma Phi on November 7, 1964.

==Career==
Kaye&#x27;s uncle was songwriter Larry Kusik, who wrote lyrics to &quot;A Time For Us&quot; and &quot;Speak Softly Love&quot;. Kusik noticed Kaye&#x27;s lengthening hair and musical commitment, and asked him to sing on a song that he co-wrote with Ritchie Adams (&quot;You Were Mine&quot;).

Kaye recorded &quot;Crazy Like A Fox&quot; and its flip side song, &quot;Shock Me&quot;, which were released as a 45, issued under the name of Link Cromwell, and leased to Hollywood Records, a division of Starday Records in Nashville; it was released in March 1966. It garnered a Newcomer Pick of the Week from &quot;Cashbox&quot; (&quot;A rhythmic bluesy folk-rocker with a pulsating beat&quot;) and was issued in the UK and Australia. Kaye&#x27;s group at the time, The Zoo, played the college circuit in New York and Pennsylvania, an experience captured on &quot;Live 1966&quot;, an album released by Norton Records.

He began writing for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine, and later for &quot;Fusion&quot;, &quot;Crawdaddy&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Creem&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He became music editor for &quot;Cavalier&quot;, a men&#x27;s magazine, where he also wrote a monthly column until 1975. He served as the New York correspondent for &quot;Disc&quot;, a British weekly publication. He edited &quot;Rock Scene&quot; and &quot;Hit Parader&quot;.

While working at a record store on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, Kaye met poet and vocalist Patti Smith. On February 10, 1971, he backed her at a reading at St. Mark&#x27;s Church on East 10th Street, opening for Gerard Malanga. They resumed performing in November 1973, and Kaye produced Smith&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Hey Joe/Piss Factory&quot;, and performed as part of her group throughout the 1970s, contributing to four of Smith&#x27;s albums: &quot;Horses&quot; (1975), &quot;Radio Ethiopia&quot; (1976), &quot;Easter&quot; (1978), and &quot;Wave&quot; (1979).

Kaye authored a 1972 anthology of garage rock during the 1960s, &quot;&quot;. With David Dalton, he co-authored the book &quot;Rock 100&quot;, a 1977 overview of leading rock stars from the 1950s into the 1970s.

Following the Patti Smith Group&#x27;s final performance, for the time being, in September 1979, Kaye joined Jim Carroll and his band and fronted his own group, Lenny Kaye Connection. Over the years he has worked in studio capacities with Carroll, R.E.M., James, Soul Asylum, Kristin Hersh, and Allen Ginsberg. He coproduced Suzanne Vega&#x27;s first two albums and her 1987 hit single, &quot;Luka&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy as &quot;Record of the Year&quot;. 

In 1995, he reunited with Patti Smith and has been a part of her band since, creating six studio albums, a retrospective, and celebrating the 30th anniversary of their debut album, &quot;Horses&quot;.

He has been nominated three times for Grammy Awards in the liner notes category for boxed sets on the 1960s folk revival of Bleecker &amp; MacDougal, the white blues band Crossroads, and the progressive rock band Elektrock. His book &quot;You Call It Madness: The Sensuous Song of the Croon&quot;, about the romantic singers of the 1930s, was published in 2004.

In 2010, Kaye contributed a solo recording for &quot;Daddy Rockin&#x27; Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong and the Diablos&quot;, released by The Wind/Norton Records. Kaye recorded a version of &quot;I Wanna Know&quot;, a 1950s rhythm and blues ballad. He appeared on and wrote one song for The Fleshtones 2011 album &quot;Brooklyn Sound Solution&quot;, released by Yep Roc. He appeared on the R.E.M. songs &quot;Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, which appear on the band&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Collapse into Now&quot;.

In mid-February 2018, Kaye took over the night shift on Underground Garage, replacing Richard Manitoba.

<doc id="411005" wikidata="Q1063420" url="?curid=411005" title="Ejaculatory duct">
<text>The ejaculatory ducts (&quot;ductus ejaculatorii&quot;) are paired structures in the male reproductive system. Each ejaculatory duct is formed by the union of the vas deferens with the duct of the seminal vesicle. They pass through the prostate, and open into the urethra above the seminal colliculus. During ejaculation, semen passes through the prostate gland, enters the urethra and exits the body via the urinary meatus.

==Function==

===Ejaculation===

Ejaculation occurs in two stages, the emission stage and the expulsion stage. The emission stage involves the workings of several structures of the ejaculatory duct; contractions of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles, the bulbourethral gland and the vas deferens push fluids into the prostatic urethra. The semen is stored here until ejaculation occurs. Muscles at the base of the penis contract in order to propel the seminal fluid trapped in the prostatic urethra through the penile urethra and expel it through the urinary meatus. The ejaculate is expelled in spurts, due to the movement of the muscles propelling it. These muscle contractions are related to the sensations of orgasm for the male.

Sperm are produced in the testes and enter the ejaculatory ducts via the vas deferens. As they pass by the seminal vesicles, a fluid rich in fructose combines with the sperm. This addition nourishes the sperm in order to keep them active and motile. Seminal fluid continues down the ejaculatory duct into the prostate gland, where an alkaline prostatic fluid is added. This addition provides the texture and odor associated with semen. The alkalinity of the prostatic fluid serves to neutralize the acidity of the female vaginal tract in order to prolong the survival of sperm in this harsh environment. Semen is now a fructose-rich, alkaline fluid containing sperm as it enters the bulbourethral glands below the prostate. The bulbourethral glands secrete a small amount of clear fluid into the urethra before the ejaculate is expelled. The functions of this fluid are not entirely known but are suggested to aid in lubricating the male urethra in preparation for the semen during ejaculation. The amount of semen produced and expelled during ejaculation corresponds to the length of time that the male is sexually aroused before ejaculation occurs. Generally, the longer the period of arousal, the larger the amount of seminal fluid.

Ejaculation and orgasm may occur simultaneously, however they are not coupled, in that one may occur without the other. For example, a man may have a dry orgasm (termed retrograde ejaculation); there is no expulsion of ejaculate however the man still experiences orgasm. Also, paraplegics may ejaculate seminal fluid but not experience the sensation of orgasm.

==Clinical relevance==

===Ejaculatory duct obstruction===

Ejaculatory duct obstruction is an acquired or congenital pathological condition in which one or both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed. In the case that both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed, this illness presents with the symptoms of aspermia and male infertility.

===Benign prostatic hyperplasia===

Surgery to correct benign prostatic hyperplasia may destroy these ducts resulting in retrograde ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation empties the seminal fluid formed in the emission phase into the bladder of the male instead of expelling it through the urethra and out the tip of the penis. This results in a dry orgasm, where orgasm may still be experienced but without expulsion of semen from the ejaculatory ducts.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, the geometric standard deviation (GSD) describes how spread out are a set of numbers whose preferred average is the geometric mean. For such data, it may be preferred to the more usual standard deviation. Note that unlike the usual &quot;arithmetic&quot; standard deviation, the &quot;geometric&quot; standard deviation is a multiplicative factor, and thus is dimensionless, rather than having the same dimension as the input values. Thus, the geometric standard deviation may be more appropriately called geometric SD factor. When using geometric SD factor in conjunction with geometric mean, it should be described as &quot;the range from (the geometric mean divided by the geometric SD factor) to (the geometric mean multiplied by the geometric SD factor), and one cannot add/subtract &quot;geometric SD factor&quot; to/from geometric mean.

==Definition==
If the geometric mean of a set of numbers formula_1 is denoted as then the geometric standard deviation is

formula_2

==Derivation==

If the geometric mean is

formula_3

then taking the natural logarithm of both sides results in

formula_4

The logarithm of a product is a sum of logarithms (assuming formula_5 is positive for all so

formula_6

It can now be seen that formula_7 is the arithmetic mean of the set therefore the arithmetic standard deviation of this same set should be

formula_8

This simplifies to

formula_2

==Geometric standard score==

The geometric version of the standard score is

formula_10

If the geometric mean, standard deviation, and z-score of a datum are known, then the raw score can be reconstructed by

formula_11

==Relationship to log-normal distribution==
The geometric standard deviation is used as a measure of log-normal dispersion analogously to the geometric mean. As the log-transform of a log-normal distribution results in a normal distribution, we see that the
geometric standard deviation is the exponentiated value of the standard deviation of the log-transformed values, i.e. 

As such, the geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation of a sample of
data from a log-normally distributed population may be used to find the bounds of confidence intervals analogously to the way the arithmetic mean and standard deviation are used to bound confidence intervals for a normal distribution. See discussion in log-normal distribution for details.
