<text>David IV, also known as David IV the Builder () ( 1073 – 24 January 1125), of the Bagrationi dynasty, was the 5th king (&quot;mepe&quot;) of the Kingdom of Georgia from 1089 until his death in 1125.

Popularly considered to be the greatest and most successful Georgian ruler in history and an original architect of the Georgian Golden Age, he succeeded in driving the Seljuk Turks out of the country, winning the Battle of Didgori in 1121. His reforms of the army and administration enabled him to reunite the country and bring most of the lands of the Caucasus under Georgia&#x27;s control. A friend of the Church and a notable promoter of Christian culture, he was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church.

==Sobriquet and regnal ordinal==
The epithet &quot;aghmashenebeli&quot; (), which is translated as &quot;the Builder&quot; (in the sense of &quot;built completely&quot;), &quot;the Rebuilder&quot;, or &quot;the Restorer&quot;, first appears as the sobriquet of David in the charter issued in the name of &quot;King of Kings Bagrat&quot; in 1452 and becomes firmly affixed to him in the works of the 17th- and 18th-century historians such as Parsadan Gorgijanidze, Beri Egnatashvili and Prince Vakhushti. Epigraphic data also provide evidence for the early use of David&#x27;s other epithet, &quot;the Great&quot; (დიდი, &quot;didi&quot;).

Retrospectively, David the Builder has been variously referred to as David II, III, and IV, reflecting substantial variation in the ordinals assigned to the Georgian Bagratids, especially in the early period of their history, as the numbering of successive rulers moves between the many branches of the family. Scholars in Georgia favor David IV, his namesake predecessors being: David I Kouropalates (died 881), David II Magistros (died 937), and David III Kuropalates (died 1001), all members of the principal line of the Bagrationi dynasty.

== Early life and accession to the throne ==

David was born in 1073 and was the son of King George II of Georgia and his wife, Queen Elene. He was probably educated by George of Chqondidi, a member of the royal court. David grew up in a time of war and desolation, due to the ravages of the Seljuks and his father&#x27;s many defeats against these invaders. In such a situation, a major opposition to George II arose, which led to a power change in favour of the young David; George of Chqondidi would have been one of these opponents.

The &quot;Life of King of Kings David&quot; does not recount the details of the change of power between George II and his son. Nodar Asatiani describes the event as a ‘palace revolution’ involving several dignitaries in 1089. Other historians speak of pressure on the Georgian king to abdicate rather than a coup d&#x27;état. David IV&#x27;s contemporary chronicler limits himself to mentioning the change of power as a coronation of the young prince by his father, which pushes certain historians such as Cyril Toumanoff to suggest a co-regency between George II and David IV, at least until 1112, while frescoes found in the Ateni Sioni Church depict him in monk&#x27;s robes, which would mean that his abdication was forced. The historical tradition founded by Prince Vakhushti in the 18th century and followed by Marie-Félicité Brosset in the 19th century states that David succeeded George upon his death, a number of surviving documents suggest that George died around 1112, and that although he retained the royal title until his death, he played no significant political role, real power having passed on to David. Moreover, David himself had been a co-ruler with his father sometime before his becoming a king-regant in 1089; a document of 1085 mentions David as &quot;king and &quot;sebastos&quot;&quot;, the latter being a Byzantine title.

The accession of David IV was welcomed by several factions in the country as a sign of liberation for the Kingdom of Georgia, which was suffering politically, economically, culturally and even religiously. Expressions such as ‘a coronation from God’ appear in contemporary accounts. The Georgian Chronicles describe:

== Revival of the Kingdom ==
Having become king at the age of 16, the young David IV found himself at the head of a kingdom that had lost a large part of its 1010 territories. The kingdom of Georgia, which at the beginning of the 11th century had extended from Shirvan to the east coast of the Black Sea, was now limited to Abkhazia and Kartli. The ravages caused by Turkish raids since the 1080s represented an economic danger for the country, which was forced to recognise itself as a vassal of the Seljuks and pay tribute to the invaders. Internally, the foundations of the Georgian state, based on Orthodoxy and central royal power, were undermined, bringing a supposedly unified kingdom to the brink of destruction. Several historians compare the young sovereign&#x27;s task to that of David III of Tao and Ivane Marushidze, the princes who unified the Georgian realm.

=== The end of the Turkish ravages ===

The first step taken by David IV to re-establish the Georgian economy was to put an end to Turkish raids into Georgia. Since 1080 and the capture of Kutaisi by Amir Ahmed, the Kingdom of Georgia had been obliged to accept Seljuk suzerainty and pay annual tribute. Despite these measures, the Muslims did not stop their seasonal devastation and several nomadic Turkish tribes settled in Georgia at the expense of the Georgian population, causing the collapse of the local feudal system. Contemporary historiography reports that by the time of David the Builder, Inner Georgia no longer had a rural population, the inhabitants having all taken refuge in the local citadels.

To expel the Turkomans from his territories, King David began by reorganising an army whose morale was at its lowest due to its many defeats; he then formed several small military detachments made up of the lower nobility and peasants from the royal estates. Dozens of such detachments were soon created and a new strategy, consisting of surprise attacks on Muslim settlements, was devised. Within a short space of time, the monarch not only succeeded in stopping the Seljuk invasions, but also attacked the Turkoman nomads at the same time.

An armistice was soon established between the Georgians and the Turks. Under the terms of the treaty, David IV undertook to pay the tribute established during his father&#x27;s reign in exchange for a total end to Seljuk raids. However, this did not stop some Turks, whose troops were massacred by Georgian units, while the Turcomans established in the countryside were gradually expelled from the country, allowing Georgians to return to their villages. Little by little, the social conditions of the local population improved, reviving the national economy and increasing the population.

==== Cessation of tribute to the Seljuks ====
The death of Malik-Shah I and the First Crusade, which forced the Seljuks to concentrate on saving Syria and Palestine and leaving the Caucasus alone, led David IV to stop paying tribute to the Seljuks in 1099 and to start repopulating the depopulated and devastated regions and rebuilding the cities and the army. This was a declaration of war, but the sultan of the Seljuk empire did not respond.

=== David IV against the nobles ===

After putting an end to Turkish invasions and re-establishing the traditional feudal system, David IV decided to strengthen central power before embarking on more important projects. Just after the Georgian economy was restored, a large part of the nobility, including the duke Liparit V of Kldekari and Prince Niania Kakhaberisdze, pledged their allegiance to the king. This act represented a remarkable change compared to the reactions of noble society to previous kings, but was short-lived.

In 1093, Liparit V organised a plot against David. David was informed of this and reacted by imprisoning Liparit to make him a ‘wise man’, according to the Georgian Chronicles. Two years later, he was released on a pledge of loyalty and reinstated in his domains of Trialeti and Kldekari. However, the nobleman did not give up his plans against his suzerain and resumed plotting against David. Having once again learned of such an event, David IV decided to act more usefully and imprisoned him again until 1097, before exiling him to Constantinople, where he died. Liparit&#x27;s son, Rati IV, a disloyal man, died in 1103, thus putting an end to a rebellious branch of the House of Liparitids and allowing the monarch to expand his domains.

Liparit was not the only nobleman to suffer the consequences of the king&#x27;s plans. Several others, including Dzagan Abuletisdze, were severely punished in the same way after rebellions, and their estates added to the royal states. David took major initiatives to strengthen his power. He also dismissed the dignitaries chosen by his predecessors on the basis of their titles and replaced them with loyal advisors, generally from the lower nobility.

=== Conquest of Kakheti-Hereti ===

Having reduced the power of the great rulers of the kingdom, King David IV decided to complete national unity. To achieve this, he had to reunite western Georgia with the rest of the country. The Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti had declared its independence during the reign of George I (r. 1014-1027), thus depriving Georgia of a large part of its territories. Realising that only war could help him in his plans, the king launched a short attack against King Kvirike IV and succeeded in capturing the fortress of Zedazeni, north of Mtskheta, in 1103.

Kvirike IV died a year later and was succeeded on the throne by his nephew Aghsartan II, who is said to have been ‘the complete opposite of his paternal uncle’. A convert to Islam, he declared himself a vassal of the Seljuks to avoid another Georgian attack. However, he could not foresee the discontent of the nobility in his own kingdom, who were hardly satisfied by their sovereign&#x27;s change of religion. In 1104, a conspiracy led by the Heretian nobles Arishiani, Baram and their uncle Kavtar Baramisdze dethroned Aghsartan II and handed him over to David IV, who then had no need to resort to arms, as every Kakhetian citadel and fortress capitulated to the approaching Georgian forces. Once the two new provinces had been integrated into the kingdom, the king appointed Arishiani governor of the region.

The Seljuks, who still considered the Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti to be their vassal, were not resigned to another defeat by the Georgians. The Atabeg of Ganja declared war on Georgia and fought a decisive battle at the Battle of Ertsukhi. The Turko-Kakhetian army was annihilated by the Georgian troops, led personally by David IV, whose exploits are recounted in the Georgian Chronicles. His chronicler compares the bravery of David IV to the biblical David and reports the ferocity of his blows. Three of his horses died during the battle, but the king, mounted on his fourth horse, succeeded in drawing with his sword ‘a thickened and congealed mass of blood ’.

=== Domestic reforms ===

Having re-established the unity of the Kingdom of Georgia, David IV began again to reform the internal kingdom. To this end, in 1103 (or in 1104 or 1105) he convened a council of the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia in the cathedrals of Ruisi and Urbnisi. After decades of devastation and war, the Orthodox Church had lost its traditional values and was suffering from many ills, such as corruption and the hereditary transmission of high religious offices. Inspired by the ideas of the 11th-century monk George the Hagiorite, the king and his adviser George of Chqondidi aligned themselves with the demands of the majority of his subjects to overcome the reactionary part of the ecclesiastical class and replace dishonest subjects with virtuous priests. The Council of Ruisi-Urbnisi, led only indirectly by David IV who, as a lay sovereign, could not take part in the internal affairs of the Church, adopted resolutions reflecting the will of the pious party. Not only did the Council deprive the nobility fighting against central power of an influential ally, the Church, but it also spiritually purified the kingdom and greatly contributed to the national consolidation of a country whose national identity was mainly based on Christianity.

Another consequence of ecclesiastical reform was the de facto subordination of the Church to the State. However, the king had to ensure this by taking other reforming steps. Thus, David IV decided to centre this plan around the function of a single man: the Mtsignobartukhutsesi. This latter position, equivalent to the dignity of chancellor, had existed for a long time in the Georgian royal court and had always been held by monks, to avoid a hereditary transfer of power. The reform of David IV thus combined the Mtsignobartukhutsesi with the bishopric of Chkondidi, the main religious entity in Georgia after the Catholicos-Patriarch, and created the new position of Mtsignobartukhutsesi-Chkondideli, i.e. the first person in the kingdom after the king and the first person in the Church after the Catholicos-Patriarch. George of Chkondidi, the monarch&#x27;s political adviser, was thus confirmed in his position and his successors to the episcopal see were also appointed viziers at the royal court. Other officials reporting to the king were also appointed to head each branch of the administration. Thus, from the reign of David IV, there was a Mandaturtukhutsesi, or minister of the interior, an Amirspasalar, the head of the military administration, and a Mechurchletukhutsesi, the minister of finance and administrator of the kingdom&#x27;s cities.

The king&#x27;s reforms did not stop at the country&#x27;s administrative system. At the same time, he set up the darbazi (High Council of State), which included the highest dignitaries of the Church, such as the Catholicos-Patriarch and the superiors of the major monasteries, and the Saadjo kari (literally, ‘Court of Petitions’), a kind of Supreme Court headed by the Mtsignobartukhutsesi-Chkondideli to ‘defend the oppressed and humiliated’ and where the king personally came to administer justice. Finally, the king&#x27;s reforms ended with a change in the military establishment.

Under Kings Bagrat IV and George II, the general decline in the economy had been accompanied by a significant fall in the population and an increase in the arbitrariness of the great feudal lords, leading to a deterioration in the quality of the Georgian army by undermining the discipline of the troops. David IV, considering the future wars he would have to wage against the Muslims, therefore decided to use the military organisation of the Seljuk Turks as a basis for reforming his own army. David IV began by gathering together his most loyal warriors to form a personal guard, the monaspa, which depended entirely and directly on the king. In addition, the feudal militias were abolished, once again reinforcing central power. In addition to these measures, the king divided the army into two other fundamental parts: one consisting of garrisons charged with protecting towns and fortresses, and the other making up the basic army that ‘was constantly campaigning, both in winter and summer’. Troop discipline was also ensured through humiliation for cowardice and rewards for heroism. Moreover, as the economy recovered, the Georgian population grew and a larger-scale mobilisation by the royal authorities was now possible.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Negotiations with the North Caucasus ====

The foreign relations conducted by King David IV the Builder were exclusively devoted to the liberation of the Kingdom of Georgia and, in this way, remained focused on the Georgian–Seljuk wars. However, David IV soon realised that the Seljuk Empire remained a permanent threat to his kingdom until the security of the Caucasus against Muslim invaders was assured. To this end, the king drew up a plan to unite the Caucasian peoples under his sceptre. Assisted by his closest advisers, the Georgian sovereign began by establishing solid relations with the many tribes of North Caucasus and beyond the Great Caucasus.

Shortly after his 1107/1108 divorce from the Armenian princess Rusudan, David IV married the daughter of the Khan of the Kipchaks Otrok, who was soon baptised with the name Gurandukht. However, this alliance did not last and there was no sign of bilateral relations for the next decade. But soon, as Georgia began its new campaigns against the Seljuks, the king did not hesitate to call on his father-in-law for military aid. At the time, the Kipchaks were renowned in the region for their bravery, agility and ferocity in battle, but they were also caught up in a conflict on two fronts, one against the Kievan Rus&#x27; to the north and the other against the Alanians to the south. David therefore offered Prince Otrok assistance against these two enemies in exchange for Kipchak support against the Turks, and decided to visit the prince&#x27;s estates.

Accompanied by his loyal adviser George of Chqondidi and his personal guard, David IV crossed the Great Caucasus via the Darial pass in 1118. After extensive negotiations, the Georgians managed to convince Otrok to give them several thousand Kipchak troops to fight against the Seljuks. But despite this agreement, the Kipchaks were unable to get to Georgia because of the war with the Alanians. To consolidate peace with the Alanians, David IV betrothed his youngest daughter Rusudan to Jadaron, son of the Alanian king Athon and heir to the Alanian throne. Taking both Alanians and Kipchaks as hostages, he managed to negotiate a lasting peace between the two peoples and returned to the kingdom of Georgia with almost 40,000 Kipchak families (almost 200,000 individuals), led be Otrok himself, after recovering and securing the fortresses of the Great Caucasus, but leaving behind George of Chqondidi, who died during the negotiations in Alania.

The many Kipchak families settled in colonial establishments in Shida Kartli, where a large part of the Georgian population had been exterminated by the Seljuks in the 1080s, but also in Hereti and in the north of Georgian Armenia, with the aim of reinforcing the borders. They were also accompanied by Alanian, avaricious and Kurdish mercenaries. They soon adopted Christianity, learned the Georgian language, changed their nomadic habits and became sedentary, gradually mixing with the Georgians. The central government then asked each family to provide at least one soldier for the Georgian army. However, the Kipchaks, who were hardly accustomed to a sedentary life and loyal to a single person, found themselves in a new landscape that they took to be hostile. Thus, until his death, David IV survived several assassination attempts and coups d&#x27;état organised by certain Kipchak groups. But this did little to change the situation of the new arrivals and, thanks to these negotiations, the reform of the army was completed and Georgian troops now number almost 60,000.

In addition to this alliance between the Kipchaks and Georgia, David IV the Builder established deeper relations with the other peoples of the North Caucasus. He created a sphere of cultural influence in North Caucasus, established Orthodoxy there by sponsoring the building of Georgian churches among the local peoples, and developed the economies of these peoples by helping to found urban communities and introduce the Georgian feudal system to the region. Georgian culture also became an integral part of local organised societies, with Georgian social terminology being introduced. Politically, David IV decided to strengthen the influence of his kingdom in the North Caucasus by making the regional sovereigns his vassals and controlling the routes leading from South Caucasus to North Caucasus via the Great Caucasus mountain range. He fortified the Djvari and Darial crossings and set up Georgian trading posts on the road to Derbent, whose sovereign swore allegiance to the King of Georgia.

==== Relations with the Byzantine Empire ====

Since the creation of the Kingdom of Georgia and its beginnings as a regional power in the Caucasus under the reign of Bagrat III, the Byzantine Empire and Georgia have clashed on several occasions, both diplomatically and militarily, notably over the province of Tao-Klarjeti. In addition to several wars between the two countries, each of these states interfered in the internal affairs of the other by openly or secretly supporting candidates to the throne, usurpers or, in the case of the Byzantine strategy, rebellious nobles against the power of the king.

Despite several peace proposals over the years, it was not until the Battle of Manzikert between the Byzantines and the Seljuks that Byzanitne and the Kingdom of Georgia allied themselves against the Turkish Muslims. However, this alliance had little political impact due to the considerable weakening of the Byzantine Empire in the face of the Seljuks, to whom Georgia had to submit. However, the liberation of the Caucasus from Turkish suzerainty in the 1090s changed events and led David IV to adopt a new policy towards Byzantium. This involved a combination of closer cooperation, while at the same time putting itself on the same political footing as the Empire and opposing the Byzantines on certain issues.

Bilateral relations were resumed with the agreement between Byzantium and David IV, according to which the noble rebels against the Georgian king were sent to prison in Greece. At the same time, David definitively renounced Byzantium&#x27;s political influence in Georgia by renouncing the Byzantine title of Panhypersebastos, a title created by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for the closest allies of the imperial family. Finally, from the reign of David the Builder, Byzantium and Georgia clashed spiritually, with King David assuming the title of ‘ruler of East and West’, thus claiming to have a greater influence than Byzantium in Orthodoxy.

Despite these signs, relations between Byzantium and Georgia also reached good levels. The marriage of David IV&#x27;s daughter, Kata, to an imperial prince in 1116 is particularly notable. Some Georgian historians also note the help provided by Georgian agents accompanying Princess Kata&#x27;s retinue in the seizure of power by John II Komnenos in 1118. As a result, from the beginning of John II&#x27;s reign, relations between the two countries improved considerably and the Georgian chronicles refer to the two monarchs as ‘brothers’. And, despite the competition in the religious sphere, the Byzantines and Georgians cooperated culturally for a certain period and we can thus see religious buildings constructed through bilateral efforts, such as the major renovation of the Mokvi Cathedral.

==Military campaigns==

=== The reconquest of lost territories ===

David IV the Builder considered the security of the Caucasus and, therefore, the liberation of the region from the Seljuks to be the main goal of his reign. It was for this reason that, well before the start of the main negotiations with the Kipchaks, he already began to fight against the Turkish presence in Caucasus in 1110. Up until that year, the Turks had occupied the towns of Tbilisi and Rustavi, the regions of Samshvilde and Agarani and Armenia, where hundreds of Muslim settlers arrived every year during the harvest period. The Georgians, led by George of Chqondidi, his nephew Theodore, governor of Trialeti, Abuleti and Ivane I Orbeli, retaliated against the Turkish settlement and recaptured the town of Samshvilde without a major battle, adding it to the royal domains. Following this capture, the Seljuks left a large part of their occupied territories, allowing Georgian troops to capture .

In response to this double defeat, Sultan Muhammad I Tapar sent a large army of 100,000 soldiers to invade Georgia in 1110. Knowing that the Turkish troops were approaching, David IV left his residence at Nacharmagevi with a personal guard of just 1,500 and set out to meet the invaders during the night. The two armies, clearly unequal, clashed the next day at the Battle of Trialeti in a fierce battle that ended in a decisive victory for Georgia. The Georgian Chronicles recount that, not believing in such a simple victory, the king stayed on until the following day, waiting for another Seljuk retaliation, and only then realised the Seljuk defeat.

The situation developed only slightly over the next five years. But in 1115, George of Chqondidi, who commanded the Georgian forces while David IV was in Mukhrani, captured Rustavi, one of the strong Turkish strongholds in southern Georgia. The Turks were then forced to leave their winter quarters, while the king personally took charge of detachments organising seasonal expeditions against the Muslim occupiers. In February 1116, David IV managed to trap the Seljuks, inflicting considerable losses on them on the Chorokhi and capturing Tao-Klarjeti and the many riches left there by the Turks.

The conflict soon took on a regional dimension with the opening of a new front in Eastern South Caucasus. In 1117, the Georgians led by Crown Prince Demetrius invaded Shirvan after capturing the fortress of Gishi, which had been in the hands of rebellious nobles. Demetrius fought ‘marvellous battles’ in the region and captured the fortress of Kaladzori, before returning home with many captives and much wealth.

The Georgian army&#x27;s first notable defeat came in 1118, when General was killed by the Turks in Javakheti. Despite this loss, however, David IV refused to listen to his nobles&#x27; advice to retreat and managed to avenge Beshken&#x27;s death by defeating the Seljuks at the Battle of Rakhsi and massacred the Seljuk garrisons on Araxes in April 1118.

The reforming sovereign&#x27;s successes did not stop there. Still in 1118, the Armenian towns of Lori and Agarak were captured by David IV, marking the beginning of the conquest of Armenia by medieval Georgia, while the Agarani region was recaptured in July of the same year, after just one day of fighting. It was after this victory at Agarani that David IV and George of Chqondidi travelled to North Caucasus, realising that despite the encouraging signs of a total defeat for the Seljuk forces, the Georgian army would have to be considerably strengthened to achieve this goal. The royal administration, now headed by Simon of Chqondidi since the death of George, devoted the year 1119 exclusively to establishing a new strategy against the Turks, while establishing Kipchak mercenaries on Georgian territory, before launching a new offensive at the beginning of 1120.

=== Battles to drive out the Turks ===
King David IV used to go to Abkhazia and the Turks wintered near the banks of the Mtkvari. The Turks had been watching David IV and were following his tracks. David IV went to Geguti and from there to Khupati and thus gave the Turks the confidence to return. Learning that he was away, they camped at Botora. The Turks were many and they set up camps to spend the winter. On February 14, David IV suddenly attacked the Turks and completely destroyed them at the Battle of Botora. Only a few of them managed to get on their horses and flee. In the battle the Georgians captured many Turks and took much booty.

Only two months later, David IV again led his troops to intervene in Shirvan: after capturing the city of Qabala and returning to Georgia with large loads of gold, he returned to the region on May 7, 1120 and ravaged the country from Arbia-lizhatat to Khishtalanti and Kurdevan. At the same time, David IV managed to convince his vassal of Derbent to invade Shirvan and a war between the two parties soon broke out. In November, the Derbentians killed Shirvanshah Afridun I in combat, giving the king of Georgia the opportunity to place his own son-in-law and vassal, Manuchihr III, in Shirvan. At the same time, David the Builder led short but effective campaigns in the southeast and notably took the Turkish bastions of Arsharunik and Sevgelamej.

Taking advantage of the climatic conditions which had until then worked against them, the Turks in turn organized a large-scale offensive against Georgia in winter 1120–21. Indeed, at that time, David IV resided in Abkhazia in his winter home and the Turkish strategy therefore lay in a rapid invasion of central and eastern Georgia. Soon, Seljuk forces occupied much of Kartli, as far as the Greater Caucasus. However, King David, having learned of the situation in the rest of his kingdom, rushed out of Abkhazia and ordered his soldiers to dig a passage through Likhi Range, then impassable and thus separating eastern Georgia from its part Western. The Georgian troops attacked Khunan and engaged in bloody combat until the spring, and all the Turkish forces were expelled or massacred in March 1121.

But the Seljuks did not stop there. Knowing that the flooding of the Mtkvari made crossing the river almost impossible at this time of year, the Seljuks soon returned to their positions south of the river and occupied Barda. But once again, David IV, accompanied by a personal guard of Kipchaks, crossed the river towards Khunan and organized military incursions against the Turks stationed at Barda and Arabia in June. The Muslims, according to Georgian historiography, were then “reduced to the brink” by a long series of costly defeats for more than ten years.

==== Battle of Didgori ====

Shortly after the double defeat of Barda and Arabia, the Turkish settlers of South Caucasus and the Muslim merchants of Ganja, Tbilisi and Dmanisi sent representatives to the Seljuk Sultan of Iraq Mahmud II (r. 1118–1131), formally requesting military support against the Georgian forces. The Muslim monarch, fed up with the victories won by an increasingly powerful Christian kingdom while the Crusaders already found themselves powerful enemies of the Turks in the west, then declared jihad (holy war of Islam) against Georgia and unifies a large Turkish army with detachments formed by the Seljuks of Turks coming from all over the Middle East (from Damascus and Aleppo to Caucasus) with: Tughril a Seljuk cadet who governs Azerbaijan and Arran from Nakhchivan, Arab forces of the Mazyadid emir Dubays ibn Sadaka, troops led by Najm ad-Din Ilghazi ibn Artuq from Aleppo, and garrisons from Ganja and Armenia, with the aim of invade the Kingdom of Georgia. Mahmud II also appointed General Ilghazi, famous for his battles against the Europeans in the Holy Land and having concluded a temporary truce with the crusading Latins, as commander of these massive Muslim troops, whose numbers rose, d &#x27;according to the sources, from 200,000 to 400,000 or even 600,000 soldiers.

Having learned of the declaration of jihad by Mahmud II, David IV understood that the defeat of such an army would lead to the total liberation of the Caucasus and, therefore, the completion of the political goal of the Georgian ruler. In turn, he assembled a large army, composed of 40,000 Georgians, 15,000 Kipchaks and 5,000 Alans (60,000 troops in total), to which was added a detachment of 200 to 1,000 Crusaders from Western Europe. The king decided to let the Turks penetrate into Georgia proper, with the idea of benefiting from the local geography, and finally intercepted the enemy on the roads linking Trialeti to interior Kartli. The two armies met near the town of Manglisi, at the foot of Mount Didgori, on August 12, 1121.

According to the French knight and historian Walter the Chancellor, before heading off to battle, King David inspired his army with these words:

The king personally launches the attack, rushing his troops towards the attackers with a ferocity comparable to that of a &quot;rambling monster&quot;. From the first attack, the Muslims were forced to retreat despite their numerical superiority, allowing the Georgians to multiply such attacks. Soon, these maneuvers bring the enemy to such a degree of excitement and disorientation that they make him lose composure. At this moment, David IV launched a new attack, which turned into a coup de grace for the Muslim allies on the battlefield: suddenly, the vigor of the enemy army collapsed in the middle of the fight. The genius of Georgian strategy then defeated the power of numbers, bringing a decisive defeat to the Seljuk Empire and its influence in the Caucasus. Testimonies report in various chronicles, both Christian and Muslim, that Saint George personally led the Georgian forces against the invader. Among the many commanders of the invading troops, only General Ilghazi and his son-in-law Dubays managed to escape. This victory at the Battle of Didgori had an important repercussion on the fate of the Crusades, whose leaders were then seeking crucial aid against the Turks, and stories, sometimes exaggerated, of Didgori&#x27;s victory were told in the royal courts of the West as a new hope against Muslim power.

=== Relations with the Middle East ===
Besides Europe, David IV established relations with the Middle East. This is how he maintained close relations with the Crusader forces, and in particular with King Baldwin I of Jerusalem (r. 1100–1118), with whom he exchanged numerous gifts as a sign of support. In addition, as stated above, a battalion of Latins composed of 200 to 1,000 men participated during the Battle of Didgori. Some sources also speak of the participation of Georgian auxiliary forces during the Siege of Jerusalem in 1099. The historian Prince Ioane of Georgia even reports a secret visit by King Baldwin II of Jerusalem to the Georgian royal court. The existence of a powerful Kingdom of Georgia is also felt in the Arab world, where the Georgian monarch&#x27;s kindness to his Muslim subjects and his knowledge of the Quran are renowned. A coin with the Arabic inscription “King of Kings David, the Sword of the Messiah” then circulated throughout the Middle East.

== Last years ==

=== Liberation of Tbilisi ===
The defeat of the Seljuk Empire at the Battle of Didgori in August 1121 allowed David IV to liberate the Caucasus from Muslim domination dating back several centuries. Georgia&#x27;s enemies found themselves decisively defeated, preventing them from retaliating against the northern Christian advance, while the Crusades raged in the west of the Turkic world. However, there remains a last Islamic enclave within the Georgian kingdom, an enclave having lost all relations with other Muslim states since the start of King David&#x27;s conquests. This corresponds to the Emirate of Tbilisi, which had been occupied by the Arabs for almost five centuries, and contains the regions of Tbilisi and Dmanisi.

Already in June 1121, David IV had put the city of Tbilisi under siege but was content with a formal allegiance with an annual tribute, in view of the upcoming war against the Turkish invaders. Once the Seljuks were defeated, the sovereign focused on the capture of Tbilisi from the beginning of 1122. After a short siege, the king, probably accompanied by general Ivane Orbeli, managed to take the city in February and enters it to rid it of the Muslim elite. According to Arab historiography, David IV carried out a pillage on the first day of the conquest, devastating the mosques and other signs of the Islamization of the Georgian city, but soon calmed down. and, in the words of the 15th-century Arab historian Badr al-Din al-Ayni, &quot;respected the feelings of Muslims more than Muslim rulers had done before.&quot;

Following the capture of the city, the king transferred the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, thus restoring the latter to the status it had before the Arab conquest of the 7th century. The recovery of Tbilisi guarantees a cultural renewal in the city, whose Christian religious buildings are being enlarged. David the Builder also built several noble palaces and cultural centers, such as an important palace built especially to serve as a place of study and inspiration for Muslim poets. However, the situation in the city has not calmed down. During the following years, several bloody clashes between Muslims and Christians occurred, and even the royal power failed to calm inter-religious dissensions. At the same time, David IV decided to preserve some of the institutions of the former emirate of Tbilisi. Thus, the post of emir was retained, but as governor of the city, until the 18th century.

Despite this conquest, the Muslim enclave, whose territory was greatly reduced following the loss of its administrative center, persisted in the middle of the Georgian kingdom. David IV finally decides to put an end to the existence of this State, just after having “settled the affairs of the country”. In March 1124, he managed to attack the last Muslim stronghold in Georgia, Dmanisi, which he took after a short fight, thus completing the unification of Georgia.

=== Conquest of Shirvan ===

The resumption of Tbilisi by David the Builder ebuilder therefore established the kingdom of Georgia as the supreme protector of Christianity in the Caucasus and the Georgians now tried to assert their domination by trying to reduce the Muslim presence in the same region, this one being considered an ally of the Seljuk Empire. This is the case with Shirvan, whose sovereign, already defeated several times by Georgian troops, remained too independent of Georgian power and was forcibly replaced by a son-in-law of David IV, Manuchihr III, in 1120. The Turks, alarmed by the situation in Caucasus, then decided to respond militarily.

Sultan Mahmud II soon resumed the war against Georgia, despite his defeat at the Battle of Didgori a year earlier. In November 1122, he began his invasion of Shirvan and captured Tabriz, before reaching the local capital, Shamakhi, the following spring. Mahmud then captured the regional sovereign Manuchihr III and sent a letter to the king of the Georgians saying: &quot;You are the king of the forests, and you never go down to the plains. Now I have taken Shirvanshah and I demand Kharaj [tribute] from him. If you wish, send me suitable presents; if not, come and see me in all haste.

Following this provocation, the Christian monarch called in all his troops and assembled an army of 50,000 men, most of them Kipchaks. The Seljuk sultan locked himself in Shamakhi after learning of the arrival of the Georgian troops, prompting David IV to halt his advance, deeming it disrespectful to pursue a retreating army. Mahmud II then offered the king the opportunity to regain control of his vassal province if he would let him leave in peace, but the monarch categorically refused and resumed his march towards the Shirvan capital after defeating an army of 4,000 Seljuks led by the Atabeg of Arran. Once he had laid siege to Shamakhi, the Seljuk left the city in a hurry via the commune&#x27;s excrement drainage system.

In June 1123, a month after the defeat of the Seljuks, David IV invaded Shirvan, starting by capturing the town of Gulistan. He soon dethroned his own son-in-law, establishing him in Georgia and directly annexing the region. This act allows Georgia to reach its greatest extent since the beginning of its history. Indeed, for the first time Georgia extended from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea and from the Greater Caucasus to Northern Armenia.

=== Georgian power on Caucasus ===
The resumption of Tbilisi and the conquest of Shirvan not only completed the long process of the unification of Georgia which began at the end of the 10th century, but henceforth gave the kingdom a regional reputation as protector of Christianity and brought different peoples of South Caucasus to ask for help from David IV against the Muslim forces. This fact further encourages the Georgian monarch, one of whose plans is to secure the entire Caucasus by establishing Georgian domination there, with a view to effective defense against the Turks. As seen above, the North Caucasus was already under the cultural and political influence of the Kingdom of Georgia at the start of the Georgian–Seljuk wars, while Derbent becomes a more or less faithful vassal of Georgia and Shirvan is forced to submit.

The conflict against the Crusaders in the Middle East was also one of the main factors breaking the backbone of Turkish power. This therefore allowed the king of Georgia to continue his momentum towards the south after the capture of Dmanisi, in particular towards the historic territories of Armenia. In May 1124, Georgian troops led by David the Builder entered southern Transcaucasia and within a few days captured many Armenian strongholds, such as the fortresses of Gagni, Teronakal, Kavazani, Norbed, Manasgonmni and Talinjakari. The following month, the king, after returning to Georgia proper, resumed his journey and crossed the Javakheti, Kola, Carnipola and the Basiani and destroyed all Seljuk installations there, before reaching the town of Speri, in Tao-Klarjeti. After this offensive, he continued his way into Tao-Klarjeti and burned Oltisi after taking Bouïatha-Qour.
Having learned of the liberation of the Christian cities by the king of Georgia, the nobility of the ancient Armenian capital, Ani, sent representatives to David IV on August 20, 1124, to the source of the Bojana. Indeed, Ani had been in Muslim hands since its capture by Alp Arslan in 1064 and a forced Islamization of the city had taken place since the sale of Ani to the Shaddadids, to the discontent of the local Christian population. The said representatives then offered the monarch the surrender of the city. Taking this opportunity in hand, David summoned all his armies and entered Armenia with 60,000 men to take the city. Without a single fight, the Armenian population of Ani opened the gates to the Georgians, who captured Emir Abu&#x27;l-Aswar Shavur ibn Manuchihr (r. 1118-1124) and exiled him and his family to Abkhazia. The region was then left to the governance of the Meskhetian nobility, to General Abuleti and his son Ivane. Armenian families (including many dispossessed nobles) subsequently established themselves in Georgia proper and the royal power built the city of Gori for them. Northern Armenia was thus annexed and incorporated into the Kingdom of Georgia, increasing the power of David IV in the region.

Georgia&#x27;s conquest of Northeast Armenia finally completed the ultimate project of securing South Caucasus against the Turkish threat. For the first time, the entire Caucasus is unified culturally, spiritually and politically under a single scepter, this being Georgia. The written tradition relates the borders of the Georgian world of the time, describing it as going from &quot;Nicopsia to Derbent and from Alania to Aragats&quot;, i.e. from one sea to the other, and from the North Caucasus to Armenia. The deliverance of North-Eastern Armenia in fact guarantees this power, reflected in the official title of the Georgian king: “King of Kings, of the Abkhazians, Iberians, Ranis, Kakhetians, Armenians, of Shaki, Alania and the Rus, Sword of the Messiah, emperor (&quot;basileus&quot;) of all the East, the invincible, servant and defender of God, the Orthodox king.

Despite his advanced age, David IV continued his military actions during the last years of his reign. For example, in April 1124, he took the town of Chabran after an attack against his vassal of Emirate of Derbent. Still in the region, after having defeated a North Caucasian army composed of Kurds, Lezgins and anti-Georgian Kipchaks, he captured the citadels of Ghasanni and Khozaond, during an obscure campaign north of the Caspian Sea. Another military campaign was organized in September in Shirvan, under obscure circumstances. The king managed to recover Shamakhi and took the citadel of Bigrit, before strengthening his power in Hereti and Kakheti by leaving strong garrisons of soldiers there. In January 1125, shortly before his death, David once again faced Muslim attackers, led by the Emir Ibrahim ibn-Suleiman. The latter, accompanied by Emir Davout ibn-Soukman of Hantzit, however failed to achieve a victory over the kingdom of Georgia and the Christian sovereign managed to massacre the invaders after five days of battle.

=== Death and burial ===
==== Death ====

Subsequently, David IV began to organize plans for new large-scale campaigns for the coming spring. However, the weakness caused by his illness and his age prevented him from continuing this project and he was forced to let his Mtsignobartukhutsesi Simon of Chqondidi take care of the affairs of the country. The long reign of thirty-four years of David IV the Builder ended abruptly on January 24, 1125. The king died in his capital Tbilisi, after having appointed his eldest son Demetrius as successor, transmitting to him the Georgian royal attributes, consisting of a crown of precious stones, a scimitar and purple kneepads and sleeves. The king was buried, following his request, in the Gelati Monastery. His tomb is placed, again according to his will, at the main entrance of this religious building that he had built, so that anyone coming to his beloved Gelati Academy stepped on his tomb first.

==== Burial ====
A tombstone at the entrance of Gelati monastery, bearing a Georgian inscription in the &quot;asomtavruli&quot; script, has traditionally been considered to be that of David IV. Although there are no clear and reliable indications that David was indeed buried in Gelati and that the present epitaph is his, this popular belief had already been established by the mid-19th century as evidenced by the French scholar Marie-Félicité Brosset who published his study of the Georgian history between 1848 and 1858. The epitaph, modeled on the Psalm 131 (132), 14, reads: &quot;Christ! This is my resting place for eternity. It pleases me; here I shall dwell.&quot;

==Personal life==

The Georgian Chronicles are an important source not only on the course of the reign of David IV the Builder, but also on the private life of the Christian king, reporting his activities and personality. According to these, David IV is a very pious king following Christian traditions, David IV spends his time informing himself, criticizing and learning several episodes from the Bible. According to his biographer, David IV learned to live according to the Christian religion from an early age and continued throughout his life. David himself composed, c. 1120, &quot;Hymns of Repentance&quot; (გალობანი სინანულისანი, &quot;galobani sinanulisani&quot;), a sequence of eight free-verse psalms, with each hymn having its own intricate and subtle stanza form. For all their Christianity, cult of the Mother of God, and the king&#x27;s emotional repentance of his sins, David sees himself to be similar to the Biblical David, with a similar relationship to God and to his people. His hymns also share the idealistic zeal of the contemporaneous European crusaders to whom David was a natural ally in his struggle against the Seljuks. Furthermore, the Armenian version of the Chronicles indicates the name of the king&#x27;s confessor (who knows Armenian), Hovhannes Imastaser of Haghpat.

David IV the Builder also engaged in important charitable activities. Indeed, he built hospitals in the country for the sick, which he took care of occasionally, as described in the chronicles:

The king has several residences across the country. The most important are the royal palaces of Kutaisi and Tbilisi, but David also has residences in Tsaghoulistavi and Abkhazia. It spends most of its winters until February in this latter region with a Mediterranean climate, notably in the coastal town of Bichvinta. During these stays, the kingdom is administered by its faithful general Theodore. David IV is also fond of hunting and has vast territories for hunting deer and wild boar in his domains of Kartli or Geguti.

King David the Builder gave close attention to the education of his people. The king selected children who were sent to the Byzantine Empire &quot;so that they be taught languages and bring home translations made by them there&quot;. Many of them later became well-known scholars.

David&#x27;s chronicler claimed that &quot;he knew the deeds better than any other king&quot; because he was enthralled with theology, astrology, and history, and he brought his books with him on campaign. It seems that he read both Persian poetry and the Qur&#x27;an.

At the time of David the Builder there were quite a few schools and academies in Georgia, among which Gelati occupies a special place. King David&#x27;s historian calls Gelati Academy Besides Gelati there also were other cultural-enlightenment and scholarly centers in Georgia at that time, e.g. the academy of Ikalto.
==Family==
David had two wives: one, an unnamed Armenian woman, and the other, Gurandukht, a Cuman-Kipchak, who is the only one clearly identified.

According to the &quot;Life of King of Kings David&quot;, David IV had four children:
*Demetrius I of Georgia (c. 1093–1156), King of the Kingdom of Georgia (1125–1155, 1155–1156).
*Tamar, who married Manuchihr III of Shirvan and later became a nun.
*Kata, who married into the Byzantine imperial family around 1116.
*Vakhtang (1118–1138), he attempted a coup against his half-brother, Demetrius I, and was captured, blinded, and imprisoned, and died shortly after.

Cyril Toumanoff also suggests three other possible children:
*Rusudan, who married Jadaron, son of the Alanian king Athon.
*Zurab, otherwise unknown.
*George, referenced in the 13th-century Armenian chronicle by Vardan Areveltsi.

==Legacy==
Georgian historiography today portrays David IV as a king that few Georgian sovereigns can match. In fact, the majority of current historians agree to qualify David as the most prestigious Georgian monarch in history and make his reign the beginning of the Golden Age of the Kingdom of Georgia, an era which completed only under the reign of Rusudan (r. 1223–1245). According to his contemporary biographer, his actions earned him the title of Builder upon his death. It is notably celebrated by the poet Ioane Shavteli in his cycle of praise &quot;Abdulmesiani&quot;, jointly with Tamar.

David the Builder occupies a special place among the kings of the Georgian Golden Age in the period of the defense against the Seljuks.

The &quot;Order of David the Builder&quot; is given to regular citizens, military and clerical personnel for outstanding contributions to the country, for fighting for the independence of Georgia and its revival, and for significantly contributing to social consolidation and the development of democracy.

The sovereigns succeeding David IV had great respect for him and his actions allowed him to maintain an international reputation for several decades: for example, while King Bagrat V (r. 1360–1395) was held captive by Timur, he offered the Turco-Mongol emir a coat of mail of precious work having belonged to David the Builder, following which Timur, appreciating this present, frees the king and makes him his favorite. More recently, the memory of David IV was revived in 1995 during the inauguration speech of Eduard Shevardnadze, who cited him with other kings as the builder of the Georgian nation. Furthermore, President Mikheil Saakashvili states that his role model is King David IV; in commemoration of the country&#x27;s national unity, Saakashvili organized an inauguration ceremony in the Gelati Cathedral where he was blessed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Ilia II in January 2004.

The airport at Kutaisi is known as David the Builder Kutaisi International Airport. The National Defence Academy is named after him.

David IV of Georgia has several monuments, buildings and streets named after him across Georgia. The Russian-Georgian sculptor Merab Berdzenishvili built an important monument to David the Builder, which he offered to the municipality of Tbilisi. In addition, a university named after the former king was opened in 1991. One can also find an important avenue in the Georgian capital named after David IV of Georgia. A military decoration is finally dedicated to the Georgian king.

Furthermore, David IV of Georgia is considered a saint by the Orthodox Churches as well as by Western faiths. However, he was never canonized and his sanctification was the result of a historical and popular process. Cited as the protector of the Georgian nation, he is celebrated on January 24 in the West and January 26 in the East. Many churches currently bear his name, including a Georgian church dedicated in 2009 in Pennsylvania (United States).

<text>The New York Athletic Club is a private social club and athletic club in New York state. Founded in 1868, the club has approximately 8,600 members and two facilities: the City House, located at 180 Central Park South in Manhattan, and Travers Island, located in Westchester County. Membership in the club is by invitation only.

The club offers many sports, including rowing, wrestling, boxing, judo, fencing, swimming, basketball, rugby union, soccer, tennis, handball, squash, snooker, lacrosse and water polo.

==Locations==
City House, located at 180 Central Park South, is the club&#x27;s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. Completed in 1929, City House is a 24-story building which offers panoramic views of Central Park. The building includes a swimming pool, gymnasium, basketball court, squash courts, golf simulators, a fencing and wrestling room, a judo hall, and two boxing rings. There are also leisure amenities for members and guests, including two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and 187 overnight guest rooms.
Travers Island is the club&#x27;s summer location in Westchester County. The island was named for New York Athletic Club president William R. Travers, who arranged for its purchase in 1888. Club amenities on Travers Island include a saltwater swimming pool, yacht club, rowing house, and tennis courts, situated on of landscaped grounds.

==History==

In 1866, William Buckingham Curtis, Harry Buermeyer, and John C. Babcock opened a gymnasium on the corner of 6th Avenue and 14th Street in their New York City apartment, after discussing the rapid rise of organized athletics in England. Interest in their gym grew, and the three men decided to found the New York Athletic Club on September 8, 1868. The club was modeled after the London Athletic Club. Their goal was to sponsor athletic competitions in the New York area, and to keep official records for different sports. The NYAC was established on September 8, 1868. Its Constitution and Bylaws were adopted in December 1868. In the beginning there was no initiation fee, but $10 was required for the first six months of dues.

The club obtained the Mott Haven grounds with cinder track in 1875, using the Mott Haven grounds were used for several national athletic championships.

In 1879, when the club had 170 members, it published rules in various amateur sports, including fencing, sparring, and Greco-Roman wrestling. The NYAC can be considered the foundation for amateur athletics in the United States. It was the first organization to compile and apply a code of rules for the government of athletic meetings, the first to offer prizes for open amateur games, and the first to hold an amateur championship.

, New York Athletic Club members have won 271 Olympic medals: 151 gold, 54 silver, and 66 bronze. NYAC athletes have competed at every modern Summer Olympics since 1896, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the United States boycotted. 57 NYAC members competed for six countries at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, winning medals in 10 events.
From 1896 to 1912 (a span counting 16 consecutive seasons) the New York Athletic Club had a team represented in the American Amateur Hockey League and played its games at the St. Nicholas Rink at 69 West 66th Street in Manhattan. The NYAC ice hockey branch won league championship honors four times: in 1896–97, 1897–98, 1908–09 and 1909–10. Canadian hockey player Tom Howard, who won the Stanley Cup with the Winnipeg Victorias in February 1896, played four season with the team between 1899 and 1903.

==Mercury Cup series==
The NYAC&#x27;s Mercury Cup series is the premier regional fencing event in North America. The series includes a number of épée and sabre tournaments, ending each season with the &quot;Epeepalooza&quot; and &quot;Sabrage&quot; events. Competitors earn points based on final placements at each tournament, with the champion being the highest-ranked fencer at the conclusion of the season.

Garden City was found by Laszlo Jurak around 1977. In 2011 a women&#x27;s team was created as joint venture with Dynamo and they became third at the Nationals.

*Until 1999 the Open Div. I was the highest Championship in the USA. Since 2000 an Elite division exists which is higher and the Open Div. I is the second division.

==National Amateur Athletic Championships==

NYAC was involved with forming the National Association of Amateur Athletes of America and the Amateur Athletic Union and their related National Amateur Athletic Championships during the 1800s.

NYAC has held the National Amateur Athletic Championship and National Convention several times. 

==Controversies over admissions==

The New York Athletic Club was, for most of its history, a men&#x27;s club with the purpose to &quot;promote manly sports&quot;. New York City passed a law in 1984 requiring &quot;the admission of women to large, private clubs that play an important role in business and professional life&quot;. The NYAC, with 10,000 members, was one of four clubs that the city sanctioned for disobeying the law. The NYAC challenged the law, arguing it was a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing the right to freedom of association. The case made its way to the United States Supreme Court where in June 1988, the court held that the clubs who had brought the suit were too dissimilar for the court to decide the case and remanded the case back to the federal district court. This has sometimes been incorrectly reported as upholding the ban. Facing the high cost of restarting the case on its own, the NYAC changed its by-laws and voluntarily admitted some female members in 1989.

There were also claims, over the years, that the club discriminated against blacks and Jews. In 1936, Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan invited Olympic track athlete Marty Glickman, who was Jewish, to work out together at the NYAC. When Glickman walked into the lobby, Athletic Director Paul Pilgrim turned the Olympian away. Glickman believed he was turned away because he was Jewish. In the mid-1950s, New York City Councilman Earl D. Brown, a Manhattan Democrat, refused to attend an outing at an NYAC facility to protest the fact that the club: &quot;discriminates against Negroes and Jews on its track team&quot;. The &quot;Race Relations Reporter&quot; reported that a spokesman for the NYAC, Alfred Foster, &quot;admitted that the club has no Jewish or Negro athletes on its teams&quot;. However, it also reported that the club secretary stated there were some Jewish members of the NYAC.

In February 1962, New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. quit the NYAC due to allegations that it barred blacks and Jews. Woody Allen had a joke about a Jewish couple that was dressed as a moose and was shot and stuffed and mounted at the NYAC, with his punch line being &quot;And the joke is on them, because it is restricted.&quot;

In May 1964, the club was picketed by demonstrators from the Congress for Racial Equality who shouted slogans calling for integration of Negroes and Jews. In the late 1960s, members of The Olympic Project for Human Rights organized black athletes to boycott events held at the NYAC on the grounds that the club excluded Blacks and Jews from membership. Olympian Byron Dyce and most black athletes boycotted the NYAC Games at Madison Square Garden in February 1968 to protest what it alleged were the club&#x27;s discriminatory membership policies. A 500-600-person crowd protested outside the Games, with picketers charging at police, who swung their nightsticks at the picketers in reaction, with each at times knocking the others to the ground. At the same time, fifty alumni of the University of Notre Dame encouraged their fellow alumni to resign from the club unless it explained its exclusion of non-Whites and Jews. In June 1970, columnist Nat Hentoff criticized Ted Sorensen, who was running in the primary election for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator from New York, because Sorensen had lived for a time at the NYAC, writing: &quot;what kind of man would &quot;choose&quot; to live in one of this city&#x27;s redoubts of bigotry?&quot;

In 1980, Wrestler Ken Mallory became the first African-American to represent the New York Athletic Club.

In March 1981, prior to a press conference at the NYAC, Muhammad Ali picked up the microphone to test it out and said: &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, the Jews and niggers and all the other members of the NAACP welcome you to the NYAC.&quot; In 1989, Olympic gold medal winner Antonio McKay became the first Black track and field athlete to compete for the NYAC. In January 1998, Curtis A. Harris would become the first black person elected to serve on the NYAC&#x27;s 19-member board of directors.

<doc id="420855" wikidata="Q104419" url="?curid=420855" title="Joseph Kony">
<text>Joseph Rao Kony (born ) is a Ugandan militant and warlord who founded the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA), designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Peacekeepers, the European Union, and various other governments including the United Kingdom and United States.

An Acholi, Kony served as an altar boy in his childhood. After the Ugandan Civil War, Kony participated in the subsequent insurgency against president Yoweri Museveni under the Holy Spirit Movement or the Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army before founding the LRA in 1987. Aiming to create a Christian state based on dominion theology, Kony directed the multi-decade Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency. After Kony&#x27;s terror activities, he was banished from Uganda and shifted to South Sudan.

Kony has long been one of Africa&#x27;s most notorious and most wanted militant warlords. He has been accused by government entities of ordering the abduction of children to become child soldiers and sex slaves. Approximately 66,000 children became soldiers, and 2 million people were displaced internally from 1986 to 2009 by his forces. Kony was indicted in 2005 for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, but he has evaded capture. He has been subject to an Interpol Red Notice at the ICC&#x27;s request since 2006. Since the Juba peace talks in 2006, the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army no longer operates in Uganda. Sources claim that they are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Central African Republic (CAR), or South Sudan. In 2013, Kony was reported to be in poor health, and Michel Djotodia, president of the CAR, claimed he was negotiating with Kony to surrender.

, Kony was still at large, but his force was reported to have shrunk to approximately 100 soldiers, down from an estimated high of 3,000. Both the United States and Uganda ended the hunt for Kony and the LRA, believing that the LRA was no longer a significant security risk to Uganda. As of 2022, he is reported to be hiding in Darfur.
==Early life and family==
Kony was born in in Odek, Northern Region, Uganda. He is a member of the Acholi people. His father, Luizi Obol, was a farmer and lay catechist of the Catholic Church. Kony&#x27;s mother, Nora Oting, was an Anglican and also a farmer. He was either the youngest or second-youngest of six children in the family. His older sister, Gabriela Lakot, still lives in Odek. He enjoyed a good relationship with his siblings, but was quick to retaliate in a dispute, and when confronted, would often resort to physical violence. Kony never finished elementary school, dropping out at age 15. He was an altar boy until 1976. He married Selly and together they had a son, Ali Ssalongo Kony.

== Rebel leader ==
In 1995, Kony rose to prominence in Acholiland after the Holy Spirit Movement of Alice Auma (also known as Lakwena and to whom Kony is believed to be related). The overthrow of Acholi President Tito Okello by Yoweri Museveni and his National Resistance Army (NRA) during the Ugandan Bush War (1981–1986) had culminated in the mass looting of livestock, rape, burning of homes, genocide, and murder by Museveni&#x27;s army. 

The acts committed by the Museveni&#x27;s NRA, now known as the Uganda People&#x27;s Defence Force, led to Kony&#x27;s creation of the LRA. The insurgencies gave rise to concentration camps in northern Uganda where over 2 million people were confined. The government burned people&#x27;s properties using helicopter gunships, killing many. There were forced displacements in the northern region. International campaigns called for all camps to be dismantled and for the people to return to their former villages.

In 2006, in the Juba peace talks with the LRA rebels, Museveni&#x27;s government gave permission for local people to return to their villages. This marked the beginning of the rehabilitation of homes, roads, and so on.

===Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army===

Kony has been implicated in abduction and recruitment of child soldiers. The LRA has had battle confrontations with the government&#x27;s NRA or UPDF within Uganda and in South Sudan for ten years. In 2008 the Ugandan army invaded the DRC in search for the LRA in Operation Lightning Thunder. In November 2013, Kony was reported to be in poor health in the eastern CAR town of Nzoka. 

Looking back at the LRA&#x27;s campaign of violence, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated in 2015 that Kony&#x27;s forces had been responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 and the abduction of at least 60,000 children. Various atrocities committed include raping young girls and abducting them for use as sex slaves.

The actual number of LRA militia members has varied significantly over the years, reaching as high as 3000 soldiers. By 2017, the organization&#x27;s membership had shrunk significantly to an estimated 100 soldiers. In April 2017, both the US and Ugandan governments ended efforts to find Kony and fight the LRA, stating that the LRA no longer posed a significant security risk to Uganda.

While initially purporting to fight against government oppression, the LRA allegedly turned against Kony&#x27;s own supporters, supposedly to &quot;purify&quot; the Acholi people and turn Uganda into a theocracy. Kony proclaims himself the spokesperson of God and a spirit medium and claims he is visited by a multinational host of 13 spirits, including a Chinese phantom. Ideologically, the group is a syncretic mix of mysticism, Acholi nationalism, and heterodox Christian fundamentalism, and claims to be establishing a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and local Acholi tradition.

===Indictment===

In October 2006, the ICC announced that arrest warrants had been issued for five members of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army for crimes against humanity following a sealed indictment. On the next day, Ugandan defense minister Amama Mbabazi revealed that the warrants include Kony, his deputy Vincent Otti, and LRA commanders Raska Lukwiya, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen. The Ugandan army killed Lukwiya on 12 August 2006. 

The BBC received information that Otti had been killed on 2 October 2007, at Kony&#x27;s home. In November 2006, Kony met Jan Egeland, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. Journeyman Pictures released a 2006 interview with Kony in which he proclaims: &quot;I am a freedom fighter, not a terrorist.&quot; He told Reuters: &quot;We don&#x27;t have any children. We only have combatants.&quot;

Prosecutors at the ICC applied for an &quot;in absentia&quot; hearing to confirm the charges against Kony in November 2022, and in 2024 the hearing was scheduled for 15 October. Kony will be represented by a court-appointed lawyer if he has not been captured when the hearing, the first of its kind to take place at the ICC, takes place.

==Religious beliefs==
Kony&#x27;s followers, as well as some detractors, believe he is possessed by spirits. Kony tells his child soldiers that a cross on their chest drawn in oil will protect them from bullets. He is a proponent of polygamy, and is thought to have had 60 wives, and to have fathered 42 children. Kony insists that he and the LRA are fighting for the Ten Commandments, and defended his actions in an interview, saying, &quot;Is it bad? It is not against human rights. And that commandment was not given by Joseph. It was not given by LRA. No, those commandments were given by God.&quot;

Ugandan political leader Betty Bigombe recalled that Kony and his followers used oil to ward off bullets and evil spirits. Kony claims to be a spirit medium. In 2008, responding to a request by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to engage in peace talks via telephone, he said, &quot;I will communicate with Museveni through the holy spirits and not through the telephone.&quot; 

During peace talks in 1994, Kony was preceded by men in robes sprinkling holy water. According to Francis Ongom, a former LRA officer who defected, Kony &quot;has found Bible justifications for killing witches, for killing [those who farm or eat] pigs because of the story of the Gadarene swine, and for killing [other] people because God did the same with Noah&#x27;s flood and Sodom and Gomorrah.&quot;

==Action against Kony==
===Uganda===
Before the insurgency, he escaped in 1989 to Uganda. He was later captured by the Ugandan government. He was released in 1992 after the government no longer viewed him as a threat.

The Ugandan military has attempted to kill Kony throughout the insurgency. In Uganda&#x27;s attempt to track down Kony, former LRA combatants have been enlisted to search remote areas of the CAR, Sudan, and the DRC where he was last seen.

===United States===

After the September 11 attacks, the United States designated the LRA a terrorist group. In August 2008, the US Department of State declared Kony a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to Executive Order 13224, a designation that carries financial and other penalties. In November 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush signed the directive to the United States Africa Command to provide financial and logistical assistance to the Ugandan government during the unsuccessful 2008–2009 Garamba offensive, code-named &quot;Operation Lightning Thunder&quot;.

No U.S. troops were directly involved. 17 U.S. advisers and analysts provided intelligence, equipment, and fuel to Ugandan military counterparts. The offensive pushed Kony from his jungle camp, but he was not captured. One hundred children were rescued. 

In May 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, legislation aimed at stopping Kony and the LRA. The bill passed unanimously in the United States Senate on 11 March. On 12 May 2010, a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill was agreed to by voice vote (two-thirds being in the affirmative) in the House of Representatives. In November 2010, Obama delivered a strategy document to Congress asking for more funding to disarm Kony and the LRA.

In October 2011, Obama authorized the deployment of approximately 100 combat-equipped U.S. troops to central Africa. Their goal is to help regional forces remove Kony and senior LRA leaders from the battlefield. In a letter to Congress, Obama wrote: &quot;Although the U.S. forces are combat-equipped, they will only be providing information, advice, and assistance to partner nation forces, and they will not themselves engage LRA forces unless necessary for self-defense&quot;. On 3 April 2013, the Obama administration offered rewards of up to US$5 million for information leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of Kony, Ongwen, and Odhiambo. On 24 March 2014, the U.S. announced it would deploy at least four CV-22 Ospreys and refueling planes, and 150 Air Force special forces personnel to assist in the capture of Kony.

===African Union===
On 23 March 2012, the African Union announced its intentions to &quot;send 5,000 soldiers to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony&quot; and to &quot;neutralize&quot; him while isolating the scattered LRA groups responsible for 2,600 civilian killings since 2008. This international task force was said to include soldiers &quot;from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo, countries where Kony&#x27;s reign of terror has been felt over the years.&quot; Before this announcement, the hunt for Kony had primarily been carried out by troops from Uganda. The soldiers began their search in South Sudan on 24 March 2012, and the search &quot;will last until Kony is caught&quot;.

===&quot;Kony 2012&quot;===
Kony and the LRA received a surge of attention in early March 2012, when a 30-minute documentary, &quot;Kony 2012&quot;, by US filmmaker Jason Russell for the campaign group Invisible Children, Inc. was released. The intention of the production was to draw attention to Kony in an effort to increase US involvement in the issue and have Kony arrested by the end of 2012. 

A poll suggested that more than half of young adult Americans heard about &quot;Kony 2012&quot; in the days following its release. Several weeks after its release, a resolution condemning Kony and supporting US assistance fighting the LRA was introduced in the US Senate, passing several months later. &quot;Kony 2012&quot; has been criticized for simplifying the history of the LRA conflict, and for failing to note that Kony was already pushed out of Uganda six years before the film was made.

===Surrender of Ongwen===
Dominic Ongwen served as a key member of the LRA and constituted one of Kony&#x27;s senior aides in the organization. Kidnapped as a child, he became a soldier in the LRA, then rose through the organization&#x27;s hierarchy. Ongwen surrendered himself to representatives of the CAR in January 2015, which was a major blow to Kony&#x27;s group. Ugandan army spokesman Paddy Ankunda stated that the event &quot;puts the LRA in the most vulnerable position&quot; and that it &quot;is only Kony left standing&quot;.

Of the five LRA commanders charged by the ICC in 2004, only Kony remained at large at that time. With only a few hundred fighters remaining loyal to him, it was mistakenly thought that he would be unable to evade capture much longer. In February 2021, Ongwen was convicted by the International Criminal Court of 61 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes.

===LRA neutralization and U.S. stand-down===
In April 2017, Ugandan and US military forces ended their hunt for Kony and his group, with a Ugandan spokesperson saying, &quot;the LRA no longer poses a threat to us as Uganda&quot;. At that time, his force was estimated to have shrunk to around 100 soldiers.

===Current whereabouts===
In April 2022, DW News reported that a number of LRA members said Kony was hiding in the Darfur region of Sudan. From there, he was allegedly giving orders to his fighters. One former member said that the fighters were &quot;tired and unmotivated&quot;, and leaving in favor of living a normal life. Kony was previously provided with armed and logistical support from former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir.

In April 2024, Kony was reportedly settled in a camp 10 miles from a village named Yemen in the Central African Republic. In the same month, hearing the news of the surrender of 14 LRA members to the government forces, the Wagner Group attacked Kony&#x27;s camp, prompting him and his 71 men to flee towards Sudan.

<doc id="420858" wikidata="Q7429858" url="?curid=420858" title="Scam baiting">
<text>Scam baiting (or scambaiting) is a form of internet vigilantism primarily used towards advance-fee fraud, IRS impersonation scams, technical support scams, pension scams, and consumer financial fraud.

Scambaiters pose as potential victims to waste the time and resources of scammers, gather information useful to authorities, and publicly expose scammers. They may document scammers&#x27; tools and methods, warn potential victims, provide discussion forums, disrupt scammers&#x27; devices and systems using remote access trojans and computer viruses, or take down fraudulent webpages, while some scambaiters simply call scammers to annoy them and waste their time dealing with a scambaiter, therefore allowing scammers less time to scam potential victims. Some scambaiters are motivated by a sense of civic duty, some simply engage for their own amusement, or a combination of both.

== Methodology ==
For scams conducted via written communication, baiters may answer scam emails using throwaway email accounts, pretending to be receptive to scammers&#x27; offers. 

Popular methods of accomplishing the first objective are to ask scammers to fill out lengthy questionnaires; to bait scammers into taking long trips; to encourage the use of poorly made props or inappropriate English-language idioms that surreptitiously cast doubt upon their scams.

Baiters may deceive scammers with claims as ludicrous as the ones they have used to defraud their victims, or they may entrap them with Trojan horses, such as remote administration tools, that enable baiters to gain sensitive information from or damage scammers&#x27; computers. Baiters may publicly humiliate scammers by live streaming their sessions or persuading them to produce humiliating images colloquially known as &quot;trophies&quot;. Some of the images that were uploaded to early scam baiting websites have been described as a form of schadenfreude or reinforcing racist stereotypes. However, modern day scam baiting content is primarily centred around education on how the scams work and how to prevent falling victim to scams.

== Examples ==
In May 2004, a Something Awful forum poster asked for advice on how to deal with a bogus escrow scam from a buyer on eBay. Since the eBay auction was for an Apple PowerBook G4, the poster sent a three-ring binder crudely dressed as a PowerBook and declared it to customs at the value of a real product. The buyer, who lived overseas, paid several hundred dollars in import duties to claim the fake laptop. A member of the scambaiting website 419eater.com was able to convince a scammer to send him a wooden replica of a Commodore 64.

In 2005, a member of &quot;419eater.com&quot; posed as an aid worker at a refugee camp on the Chad/Sudan border in order to bait a trio of Nigerian 419 scammers. He convinced the scammers to travel to the camp to receive $145,000 in person, which would require them to travel through a war zone as well as a region experiencing an active genocide. Two of the men attempted the journey before disappearing, presumably having been jailed or killed by militants, and their boss (the uncle of one of the men sent) realized they had been baited only after selling his car to travel to Khartoum after the baiter convinced him that the men were being held in custody there. This sparked a debate on the website regarding the ethics of baiting scammers into dangerous situations.

In February 2011, the Belgian television show &quot;Basta&quot; portrayed, with hidden cameras, how a scammer was fooled during a meeting with baiters, raising the stakes by involving a one-armed man, two dwarves and a pony. Eventually, a police raid was faked, during which the baiters were &quot;arrested&quot; and the scammer went free, abandoning the money, and without any suspicion.

In January 2014, members of &quot;419eater.com&quot; appeared in two segments of the Channel 4 show &quot;Secrets of the Scammers&quot;. In the first segment scambaiters persuaded a scammer to travel from London to a remote location in Cornwall by train and taxi to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. In the second segment a female scammer met with two scambaiters posing as victims in Trafalgar Square to pass them a fake check. This scammer was subsequently questioned by the police.

In 2015 and 2016, James Veitch hosted three TED talks about scambaiting. Veitch also presented the Mashable video series &quot;Scamalot&quot; on YouTube.

In March 2020, an anonymous YouTuber and grey hat hacker under the alias &quot;Jim Browning&quot; infiltrated and gathered drone and CCTV footage of a fraudulent call centre scam operation in India with the help of fellow YouTube personality Karl Rock. Through the aid of the British documentary programme &quot;Panorama&quot;, a police raid was carried out when the documentary was brought to the attention of assistant police commissioner Karan Goel.

YouTube and Twitch are popular platforms scambaiters use to educate and entertain their audience about various types of scams.

<doc id="420869" wikidata="Q747918" url="?curid=420869" title="Léon Kengo wa Dondo">
<text>Léon Kengo wa Dondo (born Leon Lubicz; 22 May 1935) is a Congolese politician who served as the &quot;first state commissioner&quot; (a title equivalent to prime minister) several times under Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaïre. He was one of the most powerful figures in the regime and was a strong advocate of economic globalization and free-market economics. He served as President of the Senate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2007 to 2019.

== Early life ==
Kengo was born in Libenge, Équateur province, Belgian Congo (later Zaire and now Democratic Republic of Congo). He is the son of a Polish Jewish father, Michał Lubicz, and a Rwandan Tutsi mother. He changed his name to Kengo wa Dondo in 1971 during Mobutu&#x27;s Africanization (&quot;Authenticité&quot;) campaign.

== Career ==
On 11 April 1968, Kengo was appointed Procureur Général of the Kinshasa Court of Appeal. On 14 August he was promoted to Procureur Général of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1974 a new constitution was promulgated that changed the Congo&#x27;s name to Zaire and concentrated the government&#x27;s authority in Mobutu Sese Seko as president. Kengo, as one of the country&#x27;s senior-most magistrates, supported the independence of the judiciary and, despite Mobutu&#x27;s centralisation, interpreted the document as only veiling such autonomy, not eliminating it. He argued that the Judicial Council of the Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution, the state party, was the most independent branch in comparison to its counterparts. He also said that a magistrate&#x27;s prerogative to construe law was &quot;a breach in the plenary powers exercised by the President.&quot;

=== Prime Minister of Mobutu ===
After serving as his country&#x27;s ambassador to Belgium, Kengo served as prime minister for the first time from 1982 to 1986, appointing able technocrats to important positions, such as Munga Mibindo, President Delegate General of the National Electrical Utility. He then served as foreign minister from 1986 to 1987 and as prime minister again from 1988 to 1990. During the early 1990s Mobutu allowed a transitional parliament to be set up, and Kengo was chosen prime minister by it in 1994 as a candidate in an attempt to neutralise the challenge from the popular opposition politician Étienne Tshisekedi. He expelled members of the Lebanese community from Zaire for alleged involvement in the illegal trade of conflict diamonds, though the credibility of such actions is perhaps challenged by the fact that trade in conflict diamonds from Angola had long been essential to the survival of the Mobutu regime, in which Kengo had been such an important figure.

Shortly after the beginning of the Congo civil war, in December 1996, Kengo became the leader of a crisis cabinet which sought to defeat the rebellion of Laurent Kabila. He was undermined by many Mobutu supporters because of his Tutsi origins, as Kabila&#x27;s rebels were allied with the Tutsi governments of Rwanda and Burundi. As Kabila&#x27;s armies advanced through the country, Kengo was also criticized for not conducting the war very well. He announced his resignation in March 1997 and left office in April 1997. The Mobutu government fell a month later, and Kengo retired from politics. In 2003, he was charged with money laundering in Belgium.

=== President of the Senate of Congo ===

Following his return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kengo backed Jean-Pierre Bemba in the 2006 presidential election; Bemba was defeated by President Joseph Kabila in the second round of the election. Kengo was then elected as a Senator from Équateur province in January 2007. On 11 May 2007, Kengo was somewhat unexpectedly elected as President of the Senate, defeating Léonard She Okitundu, the candidate of the majority coalition, the Alliance of the Presidential Majority. Kengo, who was an independent candidate, took 55 votes against 49 for Okitundu. On 21 January 2015 during the 2015 Congolese protests he met with American, Belgian, British and French diplomats who urged him to either suspend debate and voting on the election modifying law or to remove its controversial provisions. He served as Senate president until 5 April 2019.

<doc id="420878" wikidata="Q245728" url="?curid=420878" title="Zylon">
<text>Zylon (IUPAC name: poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole)) is a trademarked name for a range of thermoset liquid-crystalline polyoxazole. This synthetic polymer material was invented and developed by SRI International in the 1980s and manufactured by Toyobo. In generic usage, the fiber is referred to as PBO.

Zylon has 5.8 GPa of tensile strength, which is 1.6 times that of Kevlar. Additionally, Zylon has a high Young&#x27;s modulus of 270 GPa, meaning that it is stiffer than steel. Like Kevlar, Zylon is used in a number of applications that require very high strength with excellent thermal stability. The material has been used in body armour, in tennis racquets, table tennis paddles, and in snowboards, in various medical applications, and in some of the Martian rovers.

== Usage ==
=== Body armor ===
Zylon gained wide use in U.S. police officers body armor protection in 1998 with its introduction by Second Chance Body Armor, Inc. in its &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Ultimax&quot; protective vests. At least as early as 2002 August, Point Blank Body armor offered &quot;Fusion&quot; and as early as October, it offered &quot;Legacy&quot;. Armor Holdings&#x27;s Safariland offered ZERO-G Platinum™ as its Zylon option, and oldest brand, its very own American Body Armor, had its most premier option also made with Zylon. Zylon body armor panels sometimes cost twice as much as Kevlar or 35% more than other advanced materials. Despite &quot;sticker shock&quot;, the marketing for Zylon body armor described incredibly low weight and thickness, but shockingly high protection, causing some to refer to it as a &quot;miracle fiber&quot;.

==== The incident and the aftermath ====
Protective vests constructed with Zylon were questioned question 2023, June 13th, when Oceanside, CA Police Officer Tony Zeppetella&#x27;s and Forest Hills, PA Police Officer Ed Limbacher&#x27;s vests both failed, leaving Zeppetella mortally wounded and Limbacher seriously injured.

On Sept 15 2003, Second Chance&#x27;s president and CEO wrote a letter about Zylon and what his company&#x27;s position about Zylon, and what their reaction was going to be. He started by stating that the ULTIMA® line had 30 &quot;saves&quot;. He described two years of testing &quot;200 ULTIMA® vests from 37 different agencies in 19 different States&quot;.

He then said &quot;Unfortunately, for all involved these results indicated the unexpected decrease in the ZYLON®fiber strength. ZYLON®fibers in various forms are used widely within our industry. Although inconsistent, these results have led us to where we are today. ULTIMA® and ULTIMAX® vests, as you know them today, have been discontinued from our product line.&quot;

The company would offer a &quot;Performance Pac&quot; to &quot;account the worst-case performance scenarios of used, in service vests&quot;, for free.

Stephen Croskrey, President and CEO of Armor Holdings Products Division (Owners of American Body Armor, PROTECH™ and Safariland®) put out a letter as a reaction to the statements by Second Chance. In the letter, the CEO states that he found the &quot;unexpected decrease&quot; statement by Second Chance to be vague. He then said his company and Toyobo tested the material regularly, and that it was degrading at a rate typical compared to other materials. Finally, he stated that for his company, all incoming lot of materials had some tested, and they regularly received used tests to test.

==== The realization and end to Zylon&#x27;s use in body armor ====
Some studies subsequently reported that the Zylon vests might degrade over time and leave their wearers with less protection than expected. Second Chance eventually recalled all of its Zylon vests, which led to its bankruptcy. The company once was able to claim that it held over 50% of the market for law enforcement body armor, all by itself. This explains why 98,000 vests were recalled by Second Chance alone. Comparable vests cost as much as $1450 at the time, or over $2100 at the end of 2014.

In early 2005, Armor Holdings, Inc. recalled its Zylon-based products, and decreased the rated lifespan warranty of new vests from 60 months to 30 months. In August 2005, AHI decided to discontinue manufacturing all of its Zylon-containing vests. This was largely based on the actions of the U.S. government&#x27;s National Institute of Justice, which decertified Zylon for use in its approved models of ballistic vests for law enforcement.

The United States Justice Department launched numerous investigations into possible violations of the False Claims Act regarding the defective vests. Throughout the course of litigation, settlements totaling more than $136 million were reached with 18 entities involved in the production and sale of Zylon vests. The investigations concluded after nearly two decades when the final settlement was obtained with material supplier Honeywell International in late 2022.

=== Space elevator research ===
A competition was held in the Wirefly X Prize Cup in Las Cruces, New Mexico, US, on October 20–21, 2006. A team from the University of British Columbia entered into the Tether Challenge, using a construction made from Zylon fibers. The house tether used by Spaceward, that the other teams would have to beat in strength by 50% in the 2007 Spaceward games, was made of Zylon.

=== High-altitude balloon science ===
Zylon is used by NASA in long-duration, high-altitude data collection. Braided Zylon strands maintain the structure of polyethylene superpressure balloons. Zylon is the material of choice due to its low weight, high tensile strength, and thermal properties.

=== Motorsport ===
Since 2001 Zylon tethers are used in Formula One to attach the wheels to the chassis, thus preventing the wheel from ejecting into a crowded area in the event of an accident which causes the wheel to become airborne. Starting in the 2007 season, the driver&#x27;s cockpit must now be clad in special anti-penetration panels made of Zylon. In 2011, a Zylon strip was introduced to reinforce the top of the racing helmet visor and provide an overlap between the visor and helmet for additional protection after Felipe Massa&#x27;s 2009 injury. The Indy Racing League began using Zylon in 2008.

=== Standing rigging ===
On modern racing yachts, Zylon is used for parts of the standing rigging. It is used as shrouds and stays. The PBO (polybenzoxazole) fiber is degraded by UV light, seawater, and chafing (the problem that caused Zylon to be removed from usage in protective vests for police usage, as shown above), and is therefore protected by a synthetic melted-on jacket. It is claimed to be 65% lighter than traditional rigging at 110–130% of the price of rod rigging. Based on laboratory tests, superior durability is also claimed.

=== Parachutes ===
SpaceX uses Zylon for the suspension lines on their Mk3 parachutes. Four Mk3 parachutes serve as the main parachutes on each of SpaceX&#x27;s human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft.

=== Conductive textile ===
Zylon has been incorporated as the base fiber for some conductive textiles, where the Zylon fiber is plated with nickel, copper, silver, or gold. The conductive fiber is used for electronic textiles, EMI shielding in woven or knit sheets, or as a braid over wires, and for signal transmission or current conduction. This conductive fiber combines the advantages of Zylon (strength, resistance to high temperatures, durability, lightweight, etc.) with the electrical properties of various metals. The conductive yarns can be sewn, braided, knit, or simply insulated like a bare wire.

=== Structural rehabilitation ===
PBO is the strongest and stiffest of commercially available fibers used to repair and strengthen concrete and masonry structures in externally bonded composite systems. In this system, the fibers are produced in the form of a fabric mesh, and a cementitious mortar matrix bonds this to an existing structure.

=== Loudspeakers ===
Yamaha uses Zylon to make the speaker cones for its top-of-the-line NS-5000 speaker.

=== Bicycle &amp; wheelchair wheel spokes ===
Spinergy, Inc. produces wheels for bicycles and wheelchairs with PBO spokes. They claim their PBO fiber spokes act as a vibration and shock damper, while being lighter and stronger than steel spokes.

<text>The Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC or CCC) is an American white supremacist organization. Founded in 1985, it advocates white nationalism, and supports some paleoconservative causes. In the organization&#x27;s statement of principles, it states that they &quot;oppose all efforts to mix the races of mankind&quot;.

Headquartered in Potosi, Missouri, as of 2015, the group&#x27;s president is Earl Holt; Jared Taylor is the group&#x27;s spokesman, and Paul Fromm is its international director.

The CofCC traces its provenance to the segregationist Citizens&#x27; Councils of America, which were founded in 1954, but had slipped into obscurity by 1973. The CofCC&#x27;s original mailing list came from the Citizen&#x27;s Council, as did several members of the CofCC Board of Directors.

== History ==
The Council of Conservative Citizens was founded in 1985 in Atlanta, Georgia, and relocated to St. Louis, Missouri. The CofCC was formed by white supremacists, including some former members of the Citizens&#x27; Councils of America, sometimes called the White Citizens&#x27; Councils, a segregationist organization that was prominent in the 1950s through 1970. Lester Maddox, former governor of Georgia, was a charter member. Gordon Lee Baum, a retired personal injury lawyer, was CEO until he died in March 2015. Earl P. Holt III of Longview, Texas is the president. Leonard Wilson, a former Alabama State Committeeman for both Republican and Democratic parties and state commander for the Sons of Confederate Veterans, was a founder.

The organization often holds meetings with various other ethno-nationalist organizations in the United States, and sometimes meets with nationalist organizations from Europe. In 1997, several members of the CofCC attended an event hosted by Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s National Front party.

Following several articles detailing some of its members&#x27; past involvement with the White Citizens&#x27; Councils, several conservative politicians distanced themselves from the organization. Although Representative Bob Barr had spoken at CofCC functions, in 1999 he rejected the group, saying he found the group&#x27;s racial views to be &quot;repugnant,&quot; and that he had not realized the nature of the group when he agreed to speak at the group&#x27;s meeting. Barr gave the keynote speech at its 1998 national convention.

In later years, the press reported the involvement of other politicians with the CofCC. For instance, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had also been a member of the CofCC. Following the press report, the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, denounced the CofCC for holding &quot;racist and nationalist views&quot; and demanded that Lott formally denounce the organization. Although Lott refused to denounce the organization, he said that he had resigned his membership. Subsequently, Nicholson demanded Lott denounce his former segregationist views following a speech he gave at Senator Strom Thurmond&#x27;s birthday dinner in 2002, when Lott praised the Senator&#x27;s 1948 Dixiecrat presidential campaign. Following the controversy sparked by Nicholson&#x27;s demands, Lott apologized for his past support for segregation, his past associations, and his remarks at Thurmond&#x27;s birthday. This caused him loss of support from a number of important segregationists, not least Thurmond himself. Consequently, Lott resigned his post as Senate Minority Leader.

Similarly, former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D) had attended an event of the organization&#x27;s St. Louis predecessor, the &quot;Metro-South Citizens Council&quot;, shortly before the name was changed in the mid-1980s. He has repeatedly said that this was a mistake.

In 1993, Mike Huckabee, then the Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, agreed to speak at the CofCC&#x27;s national convention in Memphis, Tennessee, in his campaign for the governorship of Arkansas. By the time of the CofCC convention, Huckabee was unable to leave Arkansas. He sent a videotaped speech, which &quot;was viewed and extremely well received by the audience,&quot; according to the CofCC newsletter. However, following his election as governor, in April 1994, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before the CofCC. He commented, &quot;I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones. I&#x27;ve spent a lifetime fighting racism and anti-Semitism.&quot;

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; tallied 38 federal, state, and local politicians who appeared at CofCC events between 2000 and 2004. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) says the following politicians are members or have spoken at meetings: Senator Trent Lott, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, Mississippi state senators Gary Jackson, and Dean Kirby, several Mississippi state representatives. Speakers have included Ex-governors Guy Hunt of Alabama, and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi. U.S. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi is said to have attended as well.

In 2005, the Council of Conservative Citizens held its National Conference in Montgomery, Alabama. George Wallace Jr., an Alabama Public Service Commissioner and former State Treasurer who was then running for Lieutenant Governor, and Sonny Landham, an actor, spoke at the conference.

Mississippi is the only state that has major politicians who are openly CofCC members, including State Senators and State Representatives. The CofCC once claimed 34 members in the Mississippi legislature.

== Platform ==

The CofCC considers itself a traditionalist group opposing liberals and what they refer to as mainstream conservatives; it supports national self-determination, immigration restriction, federalism, and home rule, and opposes free trade and global capitalism. Its specific issues include states&#x27; rights, race relations (especially interracial marriage, which it opposes), and Christian right values. In 2003, a full 35 years after his assassination, they criticized Martin Luther King Jr. as a &quot;charlatan&quot; and left-wing agitator of Black American communities, with notable ties to communism and holding personal sexual morals unworthy of a person deserving national recognition. They consider the American Civil Rights Movement and the Frankfurt School as elementally subversive to the separation of powers under the United States Constitution. The Council of Conservative Citizens is active in organizing the restriction, reduction, or moratorium of immigration, enforcing laws and regulations against illegal aliens, ending what they see as racial discrimination against whites through affirmative action and racial quotas, overturning Supreme Court rulings and Congressional Acts such as busing for desegregation and gun control, ending free trade economic policy, and supporting a traditionalist sexual morality, which includes promotion of the Defense of Marriage Act and opposition to the inclusion of homosexuality as a civil right.

The CofCC&#x27;s statement of principles condemns the federal government&#x27;s intervention into state and local affairs in forcing racial integration (item 2), free-trade and globalism, immigration by non-Europeans (item 2), homosexuality, and interracial marriage (item 6). CofCC&#x27;s materials in 2001 said, &quot;God is the author of racism. God is the One who divided mankind into different types. Mixing the races is rebelliousness against God.&quot;

In a 2015 statement, president Earl Holt wrote, &quot;The CofCC is one of perhaps three websites in the world that accurately and honestly report black-on-white violent crime, and in particular, the seemingly endless incidents involving black-on-white murder.&quot;

The CofCC publishes the &quot;Citizens Informer&quot; newspaper quarterly. Previous editors include Samuel T. Francis.

== Reception ==
Various critics describe the organization as a hate group. According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, most conservatives do not consider it to be conservative, and believe that the organization added the word to their name in order to hide their true ideology. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a white separatist group with a thinly veiled white supremacist agenda. The Anti-Defamation League said: &quot;Although the group claims not to be racist, its leaders traffic with other white supremacist groups.&quot; The group is considered by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to be part of the &quot;neo-confederate movement&quot;, and organizations, such as the NAACP, as well as the Anti-Defamation League, consider it to be a threat. In &quot;The Nation&quot;, Max Blumenthal described it as one of the United States&#x27; largest white supremacist groups.

Conservative columnist Ann Coulter has defended the group against charges of racism, stating on the basis of a viewing of their website that there is &quot;no evidence&quot; that the CofCC supports segregation.

Mass murderer Dylann Roof, the perpetrator of the 2015 Charleston church shooting, searched the Internet for information on &quot;black on White crime&quot; and wrote in his manifesto &quot;The Last Rhodesian&quot; that the first website he found was the CofCC&#x27;s. He cited its portrayal of &quot;black on White murders&quot; as something that radically changed him (&quot;I have never been the same since that day&quot;). The CofCC issued a statement on its website &quot;unequivocally condemn[ing]&quot; the attack, but that Roof has some &quot;legitimate grievances&quot; against black people. An additional statement from Earl Holt III, president of the CofCC, disavowed responsibility for the crime and stated that the group&#x27;s website &quot;accurately and honestly report[s] black-on-white violent crime&quot;. While these statements were condemned across the mainstream, several white supremacist organization supported the CofCC for standing by Roof&#x27;s motivations, including the League of the South, a neo-confederate hate group.

In the wake of Roof&#x27;s arrest and subsequent exposure of his affinity for the CofCC, an investigation revealed that Holt made campaign contributions to several prominent Republican politicians, including 2016 Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker, as well as Republican Senators Rand Paul and Tom Cotton. Holt also reportedly donated to the campaign of African-American congresswoman Mia Love, whose parents are both immigrants. All subsequently announced that they would return Holt&#x27;s contributions or donate them to a fund for the families of Roof&#x27;s victims. In the summer of 2020, an investigation by NPR uncovered records showing Holt had donated $1,000 to the Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump SuperPAC, aggressively engaged in the 2020 presidential campaign. Through their General Counsel, the committee to Defend the President said they had been unaware and thanked NPR for bringing the issue to their attention. The group said they would immediately refund Holt&#x27;s donation.

<doc id="420881" wikidata="Q1026794" url="?curid=420881" title="California Air Resources Board">
<text>The California Air Resources Board (CARB or ARB) is an agency of the government of California that aims to reduce air pollution. Established in 1967 when then-governor Ronald Reagan signed the Mulford-Carrell Act, combining the Bureau of Air Sanitation and the Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board, CARB is a department within the cabinet-level California Environmental Protection Agency.

The stated goals of CARB include attaining and maintaining healthy air quality; protecting the public from exposure to toxic air contaminants; and providing innovative approaches for complying with air pollution rules and regulations. CARB has also been instrumental in driving innovation throughout the global automotive industry through programs such as its ZEV mandate.

One of CARB&#x27;s responsibilities is to define vehicle emissions standards. California is the only state permitted to issue emissions standards under the federal Clean Air Act, subject to a waiver from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Other states may choose to follow CARB or the federal vehicle emission standards, but may not set their own.

==Governance==

CARB&#x27;s governing board is made up of 16 members, with two non-voting members appointed for legislative oversight, one each by the California State Assembly and Senate. 12 of the 14 voting members are appointed by the governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate: five from local air districts, four air pollution subject-matter experts, two members of the public, and the Chair. The other two voting members are appointed from environmental justice committees by the Assembly and Senate.

Five of the governor-appointed board members are chosen from regional air pollution control or air quality management districts, including one each from:

* Bay Area AQMD (San Francisco Bay Area), currently John Gioia
* San Diego County APCD, currently Nathan Fletcher
* San Joaquin Valley APCD, currently Alexander Sherriffs, M.D. 
* South Coast AQMD, currently Judy Mitchell

Four governor-appointed board members are subject matter experts in specific fields: automotive engineering, currently Dan Sperling; science, agriculture, or law, currently John Eisenhut; medicine, currently John R. Balmes, M.D.; and air pollution control. The governor is also responsible for two appointees from members of the public, and the final governor appointee is the Board&#x27;s Chair. The first Chair of CARB was Dr. Arie Jan Haagen-Smit, who was previously a professor at the California Institute of Technology and started research into air pollution in 1948. Dr. Haagen-Smit is credited with discovering the source of smog in California, which led to the development of air pollution controls and standards. In honor of his legacy, CARB started the Haagen-Smit Clean Air Awards program in 2001 to recognize individuals who have had significant accomplishments in the field of air quality and climate change.

The two legislature-appointed board members work directly with communities affected by air pollution. They are currently Diane Takvorian and Dean Florez, appointed by the Assembly and Senate respectively.

==Organizational structure==
CARB is a part of the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization which reports directly to the Governor&#x27;s Office in the Executive Branch of California State Government.

CARB has 15 divisions and offices:

*Office of the Chair
*Executive Office
*Office of Community Air Protection
*Air Quality Planning and Science Division
*Emission Certification and Compliance Division
*Enforcement Division
*Industrial Strategies Division
*Mobile Source Control Division
*Mobile Source Laboratory Division
*Research Division
*Sustainable Transportation and Communities Division
*Transportation and Toxics Division
*Office of Information Services
*Administrative Services Division

===Air Quality Planning and Science Division===

The division assesses the extent of California&#x27;s air quality problems and the progress being made to abate them, coordinates statewide development of clean air plans and maintains databases pertinent to air quality and emissions. The division&#x27;s technical support work provides a basis for clean air plans and CARB&#x27;s regulatory programs. This support includes management and interpretation of emission inventories, air quality data, meteorological data and of air quality modeling.

The Air Quality Planning and Science Division has five branches:

*Special Assessment Branch
*Emission Inventory and Economic Analysis Branch
*Modeling &amp; Meteorology Branch
*Air Quality Planning Branch
*Mobile Source Analysis Branch
*Consumer Products and Air Quality Assessment Branch
====Atmospheric Modeling &amp; Support Section====
The Atmospheric Modeling &amp; Support Section is one of three sections within the Modeling &amp; Meteorology Branch. The other two sections are the Regional Air Quality Modeling Section and the Meteorology Section.

The air quality and atmospheric pollution dispersion models routinely used by this Section include a number of the models recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The section uses models which were either developed by CARB or whose development was funded by CARB, such as:

* CALPUFFOriginally developed by the Sigma Research Company (SRC) under contract to CARB. Currently maintained by the TRC Solution Company under contract to the U.S. EPA.
* CALGRIDDeveloped by CARB and currently maintained by CARB.
* SARMAPDeveloped by CARB and currently maintained by CARB.

==Role in reducing greenhouse gases==

The California Air Resources Board is charged with implementing California&#x27;s comprehensive suite of policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In part due to CARB, California has successfully decoupled greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth, and achieved its goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels four years earlier than the target date of 2020.

===Alternative Fuel Vehicle Incentive Program===
Alternative Fuel Vehicle Incentive Program (also known as Fueling Alternatives) is funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), offered throughout the State of California and administered by the California Center for Sustainable Energy (CCSE).

===Low-Emission Vehicle Program===
The CARB first adopted the Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program standards in 1990 to address smog-forming pollutants, which covered automobiles sold in California from 1994 through 2003. An amendment to the LEV Program, known as LEV II, was adopted in 1999, and covered vehicles for the 2004 through 2014 model years. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission regulations were adopted in 2004 starting for the 2009 model year, and are named the &quot;Pavley&quot; standards after Assemblymember Fran Pavley, who had written Assembly Bill 1493 in 2002 to establish them. A second amendment, LEV III, was adopted in 2012, and covers vehicles sold from 2015 onward for both smog (superseding LEV II) and GHG (superseding Pavley) emissions. The rules created under the LEV Program have been codified as specific sections in Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations; in general, LEV I is § 1960.1; LEV II is § 1961; Pavley is § 1961.1; LEV III is § 1961.2 (smog-forming pollutants) and 1961.3 (GHG). The ZEV regulations, which were initially part of LEV I, have been broken out separately into § 1962.

For comparison, the average new car sold in 1965 would produce approximately of hydrocarbons over of driving; under the LEV I standards, the average new car sold in 1998 was projected to produce hydrocarbon emissions of over the same distance, and under LEV II, the average new car in 2010 would further reduce hydrocarbon emissions to .

====Required labeling====

In 2005, the California State Assembly passed AB 1229, which required all new vehicles manufactured after January 1, 2009 to bear an Environmental Performance Label, which scored the emissions performance of the vehicle on two scales ranging between 1 (worst) and 10 (best): one for global warming (emissions of GHG such as , , air conditioning refrigerants, and ) and one for smog-forming compounds (non-methane organic gases (NMOG), , and ). The Federal Government followed suit and required a similar &quot;smog score&quot; on new vehicles sold starting in 2013; the standards were realigned for labels applied to 2018 model year vehicles.

====Vehicle categories====
The LEV program has established several categories of reduced emissions vehicles. LEV I defined LEV and ULEV vehicles, and added TLEV and Tier 1 temporary classifications that would not be sold after 2003. LEV II added SULEV and PZEV vehicles, and LEV III tightened emission standards. The actual emission levels depend on the standards in use.
* LEV (Low Emission Vehicle): The least stringent emission standard for all new cars sold in California beyond 2004.
* ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle): 50% cleaner than the average new 2003 model year vehicle.
* SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle): These vehicles emit substantially lower levels of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter than conventional vehicles. They are 90% cleaner than the average new 2003 model year vehicle.

LEV I defined emission limits for several different classes of vehicle, including passenger cars (PC), light-duty trucks (LDT), and medium-duty vehicles (MDV). Heavy-duty vehicles were specifically excluded from LEV I. LEV I also defined a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) as the vehicle&#x27;s Curb weight plus an allowance of . In general, the most stringent standards were applied to passenger cars and light-duty trucks with a LVW up to (these &quot;light&quot; LDTs were later denoted LDT1 under LEV II). LEV II increased the scope of vehicles classed as light-duty trucks to encompass a higher GVWR up to , compared to the LEV I standard of . In addition, LEV I had defined less stringent limits for heavier LDTs (denoted LDT2 with a LVW ); LEV II closed that discrepancy and defined a single emissions standard for all PCs and LDTs. Under LEV III, medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPV) were brought under the most stringent standards alongside PCs and LDTs.


====Smog-forming compound emissions limits====
Rather than providing a single standard for vehicles based on age, purpose, and weight, the LEV I standards introduced different tiers of limits for smog-forming compound emissions starting in the 1995 model year. After 2003, LEV was the minimum standard to be met.

====Greenhouse gas emissions limits====

CARB adopted regulations for limits on greenhouse gas emissions in 2004 starting with the 2009 model year to support the direction provided by AB 1493. In June 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order S-03-05, which required a reduction in California GHG emissions, targeting an 80% reduction compared to 1990 levels by 2050. Assembly Bill 32, better known as the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, codified these requirements.

CARB filed a waiver request with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act in December 2005 to permit it to establish limits on greenhouse gas emissions; although the waiver request was initially denied in March 2008, it was later approved on June 30, 2009 after President Barack Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the EPA to reconsider the waiver. In the initial denial, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson stated the Clean Air Act was not &quot;intended to allow California to promulgate state standards for emissions from new motor vehicles designed to address global climate change problems&quot; and further, that he did not believe &quot;the effects of climate change in California are compelling and extraordinary compared to the effects in the rest of the country.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s successor, Lisa P. Jackson, signed the waiver overturning Johnson&#x27;s denial, writing that &quot;EPA must grant California a waiver if California determines that its standards are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of the public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.&quot; Jackson also noted that in the history of the waiver process, over 50 waivers had been granted and only one had been fully denied, namely the March 2008 denial of the GHG emissions regulation.
CARB decided to adopt regulation of GHG emissions under Executive Order G-05-061, which provided phase-in targets for fleet average GHG emissions in -equivalent grams per mile starting with the 2009 model year. The calculation of -equivalent emissions was based on contributions from four different chemicals: , , , and air conditioning refrigerants.

The emissions in g/mi -equivalent are calculated according to the formula formula_1, which has two terms for direct and indirect emissions allowances of air conditioning refrigerants, depending on the refrigerant used, such as HFC134a, and the system design. Vehicles powered by alternative fuels use a slightly modified formula, formula_2, where formula_3 is a fuel adjustment factor depending on the alternative fuel used (1.03 for natural gas, 0.89 for LPG, and 0.74 for E85). ZEVs are also required to calculate GHG as the processes to generate the energy (or fuel) used also produce GHG. For ZEVs, formula_4, where formula_5 is the upstream emissions factor (130 g/mi for battery electric vehicles, 210 for hydrogen/fuel cell, and 290 for hydrogen/internal combustion). Direct emissions could be calculated in a relatively straightforward fashion based on fuel consumption. Manufacturers that do not wish to measure emissions may assume a value of 0.006 g/mi. An update was issued in 2010 which allowed manufacturers to calculate GHG emissions using CAFE data; for conventionally powered vehicles, the contribution from the nitrous oxide and methane terms could be assumed to be 1.9 g/mi.

CARB voted unanimously in March 2017 to require automakers to average for new cars in 2025.

====Section 177 states====
Because California had emissions regulations prior to the 1977 Clean Air Act, under Section 177 of that bill, other states may adopt the more stringent California emissions regulations as an alternative to federal standards. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to do so, and ten of those have additionally adopted the California Zero-Emission Vehicle regulations. In December 2020, Minnesota announced its intention to adopt California LEV and ZEV rules; following a hearing before an administrative law judge in February 2021, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency adopted the California regulations. In August 2022, Virginia, citing to a 2021 law, announced it would follow California regulations for ZEV registrations.

Arizona and New Mexico had previously adopted California LEV regulations under Section 177, but later repealed those states&#x27; clean car standards in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

In Canada, the province of Quebec adopted CARB standards effective in 2010. CARB and the Government of Canada entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in June 2019 to cooperate on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation.

===Zero-Emission Vehicle Program===
The CARB Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program was enacted by the California government starting in 1990 to promote the use of zero emission vehicles. The program goal is to reduce the pervasive air pollution affecting the main metropolitan areas in the state, particularly in Los Angeles, where prolonged pollution episodes are frequent. The California ZEV rule was first adopted by CARB as part of the 1990 Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV I) Program. The focus of the 1990 rules (ZEV-90) was to meet air quality standards for ozone rather than the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Under LEV II in 1999, the ZEV regulations were moved to a separate section (13 CCR § 1962) and the requirements for ZEVs as a percentage of fleet sales was made more formal. Executive Order S-03-05 (2005) and Assembly Bills 1493 (2002) and 32 (2006) prompted CARB to reevaluate the ZEV program as last amended in 1996, which had been primarily concerned with reducing emissions of smog-forming pollutants. By the time AB 32 passed in 2006, vehicles complying with PZEV and AT PZEV standards had become commercially successful, and the ZEV program could then shift towards reducing both smog-forming compounds and greenhouse gases.

The next set of ZEV regulations were adopted in 2012 with LEV III. CARB put both LEV and ZEV rules together as the Advanced Clean Cars Program (ACC), adopted in 2012, which included regulations for cars sold through the 2025 model year. The regulations include updates to regulations for LEV III (for smog-forming emissions), LEV III GHG (for greenhouse gas emissions), and ZEV. Since then, in September 2020 Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order directing that by 2035, all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California will be zero-emission vehicles. Executive Order N-79-20 directs CARB to develop regulations to require that ZEVs be an increasing share of new vehicles sold in the state, with light-duty cars and trucks and off-road vehicles and equipment meeting the 100% ZEV goal by 2035 and medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses meeting the same 100% ZEV goal by 2045. The order also directs Caltrans to develop near-term actions to encourage &quot;an integrated, statewide rail and transit network&quot; and infrastructure to support bicycles and pedestrians. In response, CARB began development of the Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) Program, focusing on emissions of vehicles sold after 2025. ACC II reiterated the aim to have all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the state to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035, and was scheduled for consideration before CARB in June 2022. The regulations of ACC II were adopted by California in August 2022.

====Vehicle definitions====
LEV I defined a ZEV as one that produces &quot;zero emissions of any criteria pollutants under any and all possible operational modes and conditions.&quot; A vehicle could still qualify as a ZEV with a fuel-fired heater, as long as the heater was unable to be operated at ambient temperatures above and did not have any evaporative emissions. Under LEV II (ZEV-99), the ZEV definition was updated to include precursor pollutants, but did not consider upstream emissions from power plants.

The ZEV regulation has evolved and been modified several times since 1990, and several new partial or low-emission categories were created and defined, including the introduction of PZEV and AT PZEV categories in ZEV-99.

* PZEV (Partial Zero Emission Vehicle): Meets SULEV tailpipe standards, has a 15-year / 150,000 mile warranty, and zero evaporative emissions. These vehicles are 80% cleaner than the average 2002 model year car.
* AT PZEV (Advanced Technology PZEV): These are advanced technology vehicles that meet PZEV standards and include ZEV enabling technology, typically hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). They are 80% cleaner than the average 2002 model year car.
* ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle): Zero tailpipe emissions, and 98% cleaner than the average new 2003 model year vehicle.

====Manufacturer sales volume====
Under ZEV-90, CARB classified manufacturers according to the average sales per year between 1989 and 1993; small volume manufacturers were those that sold 3,000 or fewer new vehicles per year; intermediate volume manufacturers sold between 3,001 and 35,000; and large volume manufacturers sold more than 35,000 per year. For large volume manufacturers, CARB required that 2% of 1998 to 2000 model year vehicles sold were ZEVs, ramping up to 5% ZEVs by 2001 and 10% ZEVs in 2003 and beyond. Intermediate volume manufacturers were not required to meet the goals until 2003, and small volume manufacturers were exempted. These percentages were calculated based on total production of passenger cars and light-duty trucks with a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) less than .

====ZEV credit system====

The LEV I rules also introduced the concept of emission credits. Under LEV I, the vehicle fleet average emissions rate of non-methane organic gases (NMOG) produced by a manufacturer was required to meet increasingly stringent requirements starting in 1994. The calculation of fleet average NMOG emissions was based on a weighted sum of vehicle NMOG emissions, based on the number sold and type of certification (i.e., TLEV, LEV, ULEV, etc.), divided by the total number of vehicles produced, including ZEVs. Manufacturers whose fleet average NMOG emissions met or exceeded the NMOG emissions goal would be subjected to civil penalties; those which fell below the goal would receive credits, which could then be marketed to other manufacturers. 

The 1996 amendments to the ZEV regulations in LEV I (ZEV-96) introduced credits where a ZEV could be counted more than once based on vehicle range or battery specific energy to encourage deployment of ZEVs prior to 2003.

Under LEV II/ZEV-99, the PZEV and AT PZEV categories were introduced, and the percentage of ZEVs sold by a manufacturer could be partially met by the sales of PZEV and AT PZEVs. If a vehicle met PZEV criteria, it qualified for a credit equal to 0.2 of one ZEV for the purposes of calculating that manufacturer&#x27;s ZEV production. AT PZEVs capable of traveling with zero emissions for a limited range were allowed additional credit if the urban all-electric range was at least ten miles. ZEVs that were introduced prior to 2003 received a multiplier, with a value ranging up to 10× a single ZEV depending on the all-electric range and fast-charging capability.

====MOA demonstration fleet====

In March 1996, ZEV-96 eliminated the ZEV ramp-up planned to start in 1998, but the goal of 10% ZEVs by 2003 was retained, with credits granted for sales of partial ZEVs (PZEVs). According to comment responses, CARB determined that advanced batteries would not be ready in time to meet the ZEV requirements until at least 2003.
In conjunction with relaxing the requirements in ZEV-96, CARB signed memoranda of agreement (MOAs) with the seven large scale manufacturers to begin rolling out demonstration fleets of ZEVs with limited public availability in the near term. The GM EV1 was the first battery electric vehicle (BEV) offered to the public, in partial fulfillment of the agreement with CARB. The EV1 was available only through a /month lease starting in December 1996; the initial markets were South Coast, San Diego, and Arizona, and expanded to Sacramento and the Bay Area. GM also offered an electric S-10 pickup truck to fleet operators.

In 1997, Honda (EV Plus, May 1997), Toyota (RAV4 EV, October 1997), and Chrysler (EPIC, 1997) followed suit. Ford also introduced the Ranger EV for the 1998 model year, and Nissan stated they planned to offer the Altra in the 1998 model year as well to fulfill the MOA. As an acceptable alternative, Mazda stated they would purchase ZEV credits from Ford.

====Advanced Clean Cars====
The Low-Emission Vehicle Program was revised to define modified ZEV regulations for 2015 models. CARB estimates that ACC will result in 10% of all sales to be ZEVs by 2025. The share remained at 3% between 2014 and 2016. Battery vehicles receive 3 or 4 credits, while fuel cell cars receive 9. , a credit has a market value of $3-4,000, and some automakers have more credits than required.

CARB held a public workshop in September 2020 where several new consumer-friendly regulations for ZEVs were proposed to improve adoption:
* Standardization of a DC Fast Charge inlet (proposing to use CCS Combo 1, with adapters provided by the vehicle manufacturer if applicable)
* Standardization of vehicle and battery data (to assist assessment of need for repairs/condition)
* Implement a standardized battery state-of-health (SOH) indicator (using SAE J1634 dynamometer testing to define battery capacity) and define a value of battery SOH that qualifies for warranty repair
* Make ZEV powertrain service and repair information available to independent technicians and repair shops (including standardization of communication protocols for vehicle data)
In May 2021, additional draft requirements were added:
* Durability: BEVs to maintain 80% of certified range for 15 years/150,000 miles
* Durability: FCEVs to maintain 90% of fuel cell system output power after 4,000 hours of operation
* Battery Labelling: standardized content to improve the efficiency of recycling batteries to recover materials or potential repurposing
To improve access to ZEVs, CARB added proposed environmental justice (EJ) credits in August 2021 for manufacturers who improve options for clean transportation to underserved communities, such as by providing a discount on a ZEV that would be used in a community-based clean mobility program. The August workshop also included additional regulations for ZEVs:
* Range: starting in 2026, minimum (2-cycle) range to be 
* On-board charger: minimum 5.76 kW for AC (Level 2) charging, sufficient for a BEV to charge overnight (8 hours) from a 30A source

The final workshop in October 2021 proposed that ZEVs would be taken out of fleet calculations for vehicle emissions and provided yearly targets for ZEV vehicle sales as a percent of total sales, including potential EJ credits. Additionally, the required warranty period and requirements to take credit for PHEV sales were defined:
* Battery to retain ≥ 80% SoH for 8 years/100,000 miles
* PHEVs to meet one of two requirements:
** Transitional PHEVs (2026–28): minimum all-electric range with additional credit if vehicle exceeds on the US06 high speed/acceleration cycle; 8 year/100,000 80%SOH battery warranty, 5.76 kW on-board charger
** Full credit PHEVs (2026+): minimum all-electric range, minimum on the US06 high speed/acceleration cycle; 8 year/100,000 80%SOH battery warranty, 5.76 kW on-board charger
* &quot;Small volume&quot; manufacturers (defined as those selling fewer than 4,500 cars per year) are required to comply with the ZEV mandate starting with the 2035 model year

=== OHV Emission Standards ===

The California DMV implements the policy dictates of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) with respect to registration of off-highway motor vehicles (OHVs). Registration consists of ID plates or placards issued by the DMV. Operating a motorized vehicle off-highway in California requires either a Green Sticker or a Red Sticker ID. The Green Sticker indicates that the vehicle has passed emission requirements. The Red Sticker (issued through 2021) restricts OHV use due to not meeting emission standards established by the CARB. The red sticker program began in 1994 when CARB adopted standards for emissions from two-stroke engines used primarily on dirt bikes. Between 1998 and 2003, the red sticker program was refined allowing vehicles that did not meet peak ozone season standards to be operated only at specific times of the year. As of model year 2022, the CARB no longer authorizes issuing of red stickers. 

=== Commercial Harbor Craft Regulation ===
The California Air Resources Board&#x27;s (CARB) Commercial Harbor Craft regulation is a regulatory framework aimed at reducing emissions from commercial vessels operating in California&#x27;s harbors and ports. The rule primarily targets diesel-powered vessels such as ferries, tugboats, and other workboats that operate in and around California&#x27;s ports. Since the original adoption of regulation in 2008, and its amendments in 2010 and 2022, vessel owners in the state have been required to either replace their engines or send their boats out of the state. 

===Low-carbon fuel standard===

The Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) requires oil refineries and distributors to ensure that the mix of fuel they sell in the Californian market meets the established declining targets for greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2-equivalent grams per unit of fuel energy sold for transport purposes. The 2007 Governor&#x27;s LCFS directive calls for a reduction of at least 10% in the carbon intensity of California&#x27;s transportation fuels by 2020. These reductions include not only tailpipe emissions but also all other associated emissions from production, distribution and use of transport fuels within the state. Therefore, California LCFS considers the fuel&#x27;s full life cycle, also known as the &quot;well to wheels&quot; or &quot;seed to wheels&quot; efficiency of transport fuels. The standard is aimed to reduce the state’s dependence on petroleum, create a market for clean transportation technology, and stimulate the production and use of alternative, low-carbon fuels in California.

On April 23, 2009, CARB approved the specific rules for the LCFS that will go into effect in January 2011. The rule proposal prepared by its technical staff was approved by a 9-1 vote, to set the 2020 maximum carbon intensity reference value to 86 grams of carbon dioxide released per megajoule of energy produced.

===PHEV Research Center===

The PHEV Research Center was launched with funding from the California Air Resources Board.

===Innovative Clean Transit===

Under the Innovative Clean Transit (formerly known as the Advanced Clean Transit) regulation adopted in December 2018, public transportation agencies in California will gradually transition to a zero-emission bus fleet by 2040. Large transit agencies (defined as those operating more than 65 buses in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin or South Coast Air Quality Management District, or those operating more than 100 buses elsewhere with populations greater than 200,000) are required to have 25% of new bus purchases as zero-emission buses (ZEBs) starting in 2023, 50% of new purchases as ZEBs starting in 2026, and 100% of new purchases as ZEBs starting in 2029. Small transit agencies are required to make 25% of new purchases as ZEBs in 2026 and 100% of new purchases as ZEBs in 2029+. Per the regulation, ZEBs are defined to include battery electric buses and fuel cell buses, but do not include electric trolleybuses which draw power from overhead lines. The Antelope Valley Transit Authority has set a goal to be the first all-electric fleet by the end of 2018, ahead of the tightened regulations.

== Regulation of ozone produced by air cleaners and ionizers ==

The California Air Resources Board has a page listing air cleaners (many with ionizers) meeting their indoor ozone limit of 0.050 parts per million. From that article: 

== Southern California headquarters, Mary D. Nichols Campus ==

On October 27, 2017 CARB broke ground on its new state-of-the-art Southern California headquarters. CARB chose the site near the University of California, Riverside, in March 2016 and completed environmental studies in June 2017. Construction costs of $419 million, which include $108 million for specialized laboratory and testing equipment, were approved by the Legislature in July. Of those costs, $154 million comes from fines paid by Volkswagen for air quality violations related to the diesel car cheating case. Additional funds will come from the Motor Vehicle Account, the Air Pollution Control Fund and the Vehicle Inspection Repair Fund.

Over a decade of planning has gone into the development of a replacement for CARB’s aging Haagen-Smit Laboratory. Opened in 1973 in El Monte, California, the Haagen-Smit Laboratory is the site of many of CARB’s groundbreaking efforts to reduce the emissions of cars and trucks, as well as efforts to introduce zero-emission and plug-in vehicles to California. In 2015, engineers and technicians based at the Haagen-Smit Laboratory were instrumental in discovering the infamous VW diesel “defeat device,” leading to the largest emissions control violation settlement in national and California history.

The new campus features an extended range of dedicated test cells, including heavy-duty testing. There is also workspace for accommodating new test methods for future generations of vehicles, and space for developing enhanced on-board diagnostics and portable emissions measurement systems. The facility also includes a separate advanced chemistry laboratory. The Southern California Headquarters’ office and administration space accommodates 460 employees and includes visitor reception and public areas, a press room, flexible conference and workshop space, and a 250-person public auditorium.

Sustainability drove the striking architecture and every detail of the campus. Designed by ZGF Architects and built by Hensel Phelps, the new headquarters is built for the future. At 402,000 square feet, it is designed to be the largest Zero Net Energy building in the United States, aided by solar arrays throughout the campus that generate 3.5 Megawatts of electricity, and a chilled beam temperature management system that provides increased energy efficiency and occupant comfort. As a result, the facility achieves Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, and California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen) Tier 2 standards and is designed to achieve Zero-Net Energy performance .

On November 18, 2021, CARB dedicated the new Southern California headquarters in honor of former Chair Mary D. Nichols whose career at CARB spanned four decades under three different California governors.

<text>The Latter Day Saint movement (also called the LDS movement, LDS restorationist movement, or Smith–Rigdon movement) is the collection of independent church groups that trace their origins to a Christian Restorationist movement founded by Joseph Smith in the late 1820s.

Collectively, these churches have over 17 million nominal members, including over 17 million belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), 250,000 in Community of Christ, and several other denominations with memberships generally ranging in the thousands of members. The predominant theology of the churches in the movement is Mormonism, which sees itself as restoring again on Earth the early Christian church; their members are most commonly known as Mormons. An additional doctrine of the church allows for prophets to receive and publish modern-day revelations.

A minority of Latter Day Saint adherents, such as members of Community of Christ, have been influenced by Protestant theologies while maintaining certain distinctive beliefs and practices including continuing revelation, an open canon of scripture and building temples. Other groups include the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which supports lineal succession of leadership from Smith&#x27;s descendants, and the more controversial Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which defends the practice of polygamy. One source estimated over 400 denominations have sprung from founder Joseph Smith&#x27;s original movement.

==Origins==

The movement began in western New York during the Second Great Awakening when Smith said that he received visions revealing a new sacred text, the Book of Mormon, which he published in 1830 as a complement to the Bible. Based on the teachings of this book and other revelations, Smith founded a Christian primitivist church, called the &quot;Church of Christ&quot;. The Book of Mormon attracted hundreds of early followers, who later became known as &quot;Mormons&quot;, &quot;Latter Day Saints&quot;, or just &quot;Saints&quot;. In 1831, Smith moved the church headquarters to Kirtland, Ohio, and in 1838 changed its name to the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;.

After the church in Ohio collapsed due to a financial crisis and dissensions, in 1838, Smith and the body of the church moved to Missouri. However, they were persecuted and the Latter Day Saints fled to Illinois. After Smith was killed in 1844, a succession crisis led to the organization splitting into several groups. The largest of these, the LDS Church, migrated under the leadership of Brigham Young to the Great Basin (now Utah) and became known for its 19th-century practice of polygamy. The LDS Church officially renounced this practice in 1890 and gradually discontinued it, resulting in Utah Territory becoming a U.S. state. This change resulted in the formation of several small sects that sought to maintain polygamy and other 19th-century doctrines and practices, now referred to as &quot;Mormon fundamentalism&quot;.

Other groups originating within the Latter Day Saint movement followed different paths in Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. For the most part, these groups rejected plural marriage and some of Smith&#x27;s later teachings. The largest of these, Community of Christ (known previously as the &quot;Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;), was formed in Illinois in 1860 by several groups uniting around Smith&#x27;s son, Joseph Smith III.

==History==


The founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was Joseph Smith, and to a lesser extent, during the movement&#x27;s first two years, Oliver Cowdery. Throughout his life, Smith told of an experience he had as a boy having seen God the Father and Jesus Christ as two separate beings, who told him that the true church of Jesus Christ had been lost and would be restored through him, and that he would be given the authority to organize and lead the true Church of Christ.

The Latter Day Saint church was formed on April 6, 1830, consisting of a community of believers in the western New York towns of Fayette, Manchester, and Colesville. The church was formally organized under the name of the &quot;Church of Christ&quot;. By 1834, the church was referred to as the &quot;Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot; in early church publications, and in 1838 Smith announced that he had received a revelation from God that officially changed the name to the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;.

In 1844, William Law and several other Latter Day Saints in church leadership positions publicly denounced Smith&#x27;s secret practice of polygamy in the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, and formed their own church. The city council of Nauvoo, Illinois, led by Smith, subsequently had the printing press of the &quot;Expositor&quot; destroyed. In spite of Smith&#x27;s later offer to pay damages for destroyed property, critics of Smith and the church considered the destruction heavy-handed. Some called for the Latter Day Saints to be either expelled or destroyed.

Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum, the Assistant President of the Church, were both killed by a mob while in a Carthage, Illinois jail, and several individuals within the church claimed to be the senior surviving authority and appointed successors. These various claims resulted in a succession crisis. Many supported Brigham Young, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; others Sidney Rigdon, the senior surviving member of the First Presidency. Emma Hale Smith failed to persuade William Marks, the president of the Presiding High Council and a Rigdon supporter, to assume leadership and the surviving members of Smith&#x27;s immediate family remained unaffiliated with any larger body until 1860, when they formed the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints with Joseph&#x27;s eldest son Joseph Smith III as prophet. These various groups are sometimes referred to under two geographical headings: &quot;Prairie Saints&quot; (those that remained in the Midwest United States); and &quot;Rocky Mountain Saints&quot; (those who followed Young to what would later become the state of Utah).

Today, the vast majority (over 98 percent) of Latter Day Saints belong to the LDS Church, which reports over 16 million members worldwide. The second-largest denomination is the Missouri-based Community of Christ, which reports 252,000 members. Small denominations that trace their origins to Rigdon, James Strang, or other associates of Smith&#x27;s still exist, and several fundamentalist sects which separated from the LDS Church after it rejected plural marriage in 1890 claim tens of thousands of members.

==Beliefs==


Most members of Latter Day Saint churches are adherents to Mormonism, a theology based on Joseph Smith&#x27;s later teachings and further developed by Brigham Young, James Strang and others who claimed to be Smith&#x27;s successors. The term &quot;Mormon&quot; derives from the Book of Mormon, and most of these adherents refer to themselves as Latter Day Saints or Mormons. Mormonism and Christianity have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express the doctrines of Mormonism using standard biblical terminology, and claim to have similar views about the nature of Jesus&#x27; atonement, resurrection, and Second Coming as traditional Christianity. Nevertheless, Mormons agree with non-Mormons that their view of God is significantly different from the trinitarian view of the Nicene Creed of the 4th century.

Mormons consider the Bible as scripture and have also adopted additional scriptures. These include the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, although not all denominations use all books as part of their scriptures. Mormons not only practice baptism and celebrate the eucharist but also participate in religious rituals not practiced in traditional Christianity. Focusing on differences, some Christians consider Mormonism &quot;non-Christian&quot;; members of the LDS Church, focusing on similarities, are offended at being so characterized. Mormons do not accept non-Mormon baptism. Mormons regularly proselytize individuals actually or nominally within the Christian tradition, and some Christians, especially evangelicals, proselytize Mormons. The LDS Church has a formal missionary program with nearly 70,000 missionaries, with 15 training centers and 407 missions worldwide. A prominent scholarly view is that Mormonism is a form of Christianity, but is distinct enough from traditional Christianity so as to form a new religious tradition, much as Christianity has roots in but is a distinct religion from Judaism.

The Mormonism that originated with Smith in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements of 19th-century Protestant Christianity including the necessity of baptism, emphasis on family, and central doctrine on Christ as a means to salvation. However, beginning with his accounts of the First Vision in the 1830s and 1840s, Smith—who said that Christ had told him not to join any existing church—departed significantly from traditional Christianity, claiming all churches of his day were part of a Great Apostasy that had lost the authority to direct Christ&#x27;s church. Mormonism does not characterize itself as a Protestant religion, as Smith taught that he had received revelation direct from Christ to restore his original church. Mormons believe that God, through Smith and his successors, restored these truths and doctrinal clarifications, and, initiating a new heavenly dispensation, restored the original church and Christianity taught by Jesus. For example, Smith rejected the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity as of one body and substance, with no &quot;body, parts, or passions&quot;, and instead taught that the Godhead included God, the Eternal Father, also known as Elohim; his only-begotten son in the flesh, Jesus Christ, also known as Jehovah, the savior and redeemer of the world; and the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit, an individual personage of spirit whose influence can be felt in many places at once. Further, Smith taught that the essence of all humans is co-eternal with God and that humans, as the spirit offspring of God the Father, have the potential to become like God. The LDS Church, the largest Mormon denomination, while acknowledging its differences with mainstream Christianity, often focuses on its commonalities, which are many, the most important of which is that Christ is the savior of the world and that he suffered for the world&#x27;s sins so that the penitent can return to live in heaven.

A small fraction of Latter Day Saints, most notably those within Community of Christ, the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, follow a traditional Protestant theology. Community of Christ views God in trinitarian terms, and reject the distinctive theological developments they believe to have been developed later in Mormonism.

===&quot;Saint&quot;-designation of members===
The beliefs within the LDS Church with regard to saints are similar but not quite the same as the Protestant tradition. In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification &quot;latter-day&quot; refers to the doctrine that members are living in the &quot;latter days&quot;, before the Second Coming of Christ, and is used to distinguish the members of the church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church. Members are therefore often referred to as &quot;Latter-day Saints&quot; or &quot;LDS&quot;, and among themselves, &quot;saints&quot;.

===Restoration===

The Latter Day Saint movement classifies itself within Christianity, but as a distinct restored dispensation. Latter Day Saints hold that a Great Apostasy began in Christianity not long after the ascension of Jesus, marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies, and followers dividing into different ideological groups.
Additionally, Latter Day Saints claim the martyrdom of the apostles led to a loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances.

According to Latter Day Saint churches, God re-established the early Christian church as found in the New Testament through Joseph Smith. In particular, Latter Day Saints believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, and John the Baptist appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Thus, Smith and his successors are considered modern prophets who receive revelation from God to guide the church.

<text>Vectran is a manufactured fiber, spun from a liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) created by Celanese Corporation and now manufactured by Kuraray. Chemically it is an aromatic polyester produced by the polycondensation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 6-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid.

== Properties ==
===Advantages===
Vectran&#x27;s golden fibers are noted for their thermal stability at high temperatures, high strength and modulus, low creep, and good chemical stability. They are moisture-resistant and generally stable in hostile environments. Polyester coating is often used around a Vectran core; polyurethane coating can improve abrasion resistance and act as a water barrier. Vectran has a melting point of 330 °C, with progressive strength loss from 220 °C.

===Disadvantages===
Although the tensile strength is similar to Kevlar, Vectran still tends to experience tensile fractures when exposed to significant stress. The wispy, hair-like fibers tend to fray, to easily acquire dirt, and to readily entangle in hook-and-loop fasteners, from which they must sometimes then be cut or (when possible) torn.
If used without protective coatings, Vectran has low resistance to UV degradation, and should not be used long-term in outdoor environments.

== Usage ==
Vectran fibers are used as reinforcing (matrix) fibers for ropes, electrical cables, sailcloth, and advanced composite materials, professional bike tires, and in electronics applications. It is used as one of the layers in the softgoods structure of NASA&#x27;s Extravehicular Mobility Unit (spacesuit) designed and manufactured by ILC Dover and was the fabric used for all of the airbag landings on Mars: Mars Pathfinder in 1997
and on the twin Mars Exploration Rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; missions in 2004, also designed and manufactured by ILC Dover . 
The material was used again on NASA&#x27;s 2011 Mars Science Laboratory in the bridle cables.

Vectran is a key component of a line of inflatable spacecraft developed by Bigelow Aerospace, not only on two stations which are in orbit but also the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module which NASA is testing for its radiation shielding and thermal control capabilities.

The United States Department of Homeland Security is sponsoring development of an inflatable plug made of Vectran to prevent flooding in New York City Subway tunnels and for other tunnels in New York City, as it is strong but relatively inexpensive, and not edible for rats. Vectran fiber is also used in manufacturing badminton strings such as Yonex BG-85 and BG-80.
Vectran is also used in the manufacturing of Carlton Vapour Trail badminton rackets.

Vectran is used as a puncture protection layer in Continental Bicycle tyres such as the Grand Prix 5000, Competition tubular (single layer) and Grand Prix 4 season (two layers). Vectran does not increase rolling resistance or downgrade casing performance.

==Production==
Kuraray Co., Ltd. began manufacturing Vectran in 1990. , Kuraray has owned 100% of the worldwide Vectran production since 2005 when they acquired the Vectran business from Celanese Advanced Materials Inc. (CAMI), based in South Carolina, U.S.

The total capacity of Vectran expanded from about 600 tons/yr in 2007 to 1000 tons/yr in 2008.

<doc id="420888" wikidata="Q2711210" url="?curid=420888" title="USS Tautog (SS-199)">
<text>USS &quot;Tautog&quot; (SS-199), the second , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tautog, a small edible sport fish, which is also called a blackfish. She was one of the most successful submarines of World War II. &quot;Tautog&quot; was credited with sinking 26 Japanese ships, for a total of 72,606 tons, scoring second by number of ships and eleventh by tonnage earning her the nickname &quot;The Terrible T.&quot; Of the twelve &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines, she was one of only five to survive the war.

&quot;Tautog&quot;″s first patrol, into the Marshall Islands in late 1941 and early 1942, produced reconnaissance information but no enemy vessels sunk. However, on her second visit to that area, in the spring of 1942, she torpedoed the Japanese submarines and , plus a freighter. Operating out of Australia between July 1942 and May 1943, &quot;Tautog&quot; went into the waters of the East Indies and Indochina on five patrols during which &quot;Tautog&quot; sank the and seven merchant ships. She also laid mines off Haiphong and endured a depth charge attack in November 1942.

Following an overhaul at San Francisco, California, &quot;Tautog&quot; resumed operations from Pearl Harbor in October 1943, sinking the and damaging a tanker and three freighters during this cruise, her eighth of the war. Her next four patrols, from December 1943 to August 1944, took her to the Japanese home islands, including the frigid northern Pacific. This period was a very productive one, with the destroyer and eleven Japanese merchant ships falling victim to &quot;Tautog&quot;. A stateside overhaul followed, with the submarine&#x27;s thirteenth war patrol, into the East China Sea, beginning in December 1944. The next month she sank a landing ship and a motor torpedo boat tender to conclude the submarine&#x27;s combat career.

Assigned to training duty in February 1945, &quot;Tautog&quot; spent the rest of World War II in that role and supporting developmental work off Hawaii and the West Coast. She transferred to the Atlantic in November 1945, a few months after Japan&#x27;s surrender, and was decommissioned in December. In 1947 &quot;Tautog&quot; went to the Great Lakes, where she was employed as a stationary Naval Reserve training submarine at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for nearly twelve years. &quot;Tautog&quot; was removed from service in September 1959. Sold some months later, she was scrapped at Manistee, Michigan, during the early 1960s.

==Construction and commissioning==
The submarine&#x27;s keel was laid down on 1 March 1939 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company. She was launched on 27 January 1940 and was sponsored by Mrs. Hallie N Edwards, wife of Captain Richard S. Edwards, Commander Submarine Squadron Two. The boat was commissioned on 3 July 1940.

==1940–1941==
Following a short training period in Long Island Sound, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed for the Caribbean Sea on her shakedown cruise which lasted from 6 September 1940 to 11 November 1940. She returned to New London, Connecticut and operated from that base until early February 1941 when she was ordered to the Virgin Islands.

Late in April, she returned to New London, Connecticut, loaded supplies, and sailed with two other submarines for Hawaii on 1 May. After calls at Coco Solo, in the Panama Canal Zone, and San Diego, California, they arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 June 1941. &quot;Tautog&quot; operated in the Hawaiian area until mid-October. On 21 October, she and stood out to sea, under sealed orders, to begin a 45-day, full-time, simulated war patrol in the area around Midway Island. For 38 consecutive days, the two submarines operated submerged for 16 to 18 hours each day. &quot;Tautog&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1941.

Two days later, on Sunday, 7 December, &quot;Tautog&quot; was at the submarine base when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Shortly after the attack began on Ford Island, &quot;Tautog&quot;″s gun crews, with the help of and a destroyer, shot down a Japanese torpedo bomber as it came over Merry Point.

=== First patrol ===
&quot;Tautog&quot;″s first war patrol began on 26 December 1941 and took her to the Marshall Islands for reconnaissance work. After 26 days in the area gathering information, particularly of Kwajalein, she reported no enemy activity at Rongelop, Bat, Wotho, or Bikini. On 13 January 1942, she launched three torpedoes at a small minelayer, receiving a depth charging in return. Plagued by a fogging periscope, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 4 February and was routed to Mare Island for upkeep.

=== Second patrol ===
On 9 April 1942, &quot;Tautog&quot; headed westward toward Hawaii and started her next war patrol upon leaving Pearl Harbor 15 days later. Her assigned area was again in the Marshall Islands. Around 10:00 on 26 April near Johnston Island, while &quot;en route&quot; to her station, &quot;Tautog&quot; sighted the periscope of an enemy submarine, apparently maneuvering to reach a favorable firing position. &quot;Tautog&quot; made a sharp turn and fired one stern torpedo, evidently exploding &quot;above&quot; the target, and was officially credited as sinking &quot;Ro-30&quot; (1,047 tons). However, &quot;Ro-30&quot; had been in 4th Reserve since December 1938 and was converted into a training hulk on 1 April 1942. She survived the war at the Ōtake submarine school and was subsequently scrapped. Fitzsimons does not confirm sinking &quot;Ro-30&quot;, the Japanese report no submarines going missing around April 1942 in any theater, and as of 2024 the only confirmed occasion of one submarine sinking another in wartime while both were submerged is HMS &quot;Venturer&quot; sinking &quot;U-864&quot;.

Shortly after her arrival in the Marshalls, &quot;Tautog&quot; was ordered to Truk to intercept ships returning from the Battle of the Coral Sea, especially the Japanese aircraft carriers &quot;Zuikauku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; (the latter codenamed &quot;Wounded Bear&quot;); because Pearl Harbor underestimated &quot;Shōkaku&quot;&#x27;s speed, &quot;Tautog&quot; and two compatriots arrived too late and did not see &quot;Shōkaku&quot; depart, on 11 or 12 May. South of the harbor, &quot;Tautog&quot; launched two torpedoes at &quot;Goyo Maru&quot;, scoring one hit and suffering a circular run (typical of the erratic Mark XIV torpedo), forcing &quot;Tautog&quot; deep. (&quot;Goyo Maru&quot; beached herself.) Two days later, &quot;Tautog&quot; was alerted by ULTRA of four Japanese submarines in the vicinity, also returning from battle. She was caught by surprise by the first, and failed to attack. She detected and fired two torpeodes at the second. Although the Japanese boat was not in sight when &quot;Tautog&quot; surfaced, she was not officially credited with a sinking. Later in the morning, &quot;Tautog&quot; sighted another submarine with the designation &quot;I-28&quot; clearly discernible on its conning tower. Just as &quot;I-28&quot; fired at &quot;Tautog&quot;, the American boat launched two torpedoes, then went to to avoid. One torpedo missed, the second sent the Japanese boat to the bottom, making her the third sunk by Pacific Fleet submarines.

&quot;Tautog&quot; sighted two ships departing Truk on 22 May and made a submerged sound attack on the larger. The American submarine&#x27;s crew thought they had sunk the target, but the 5,461-ton cargo ship &quot;Sanko Maru&quot; had been only damaged. Three days later, &quot;Tautog&quot; made an attack from periscope depth against a cargo ship. Her spread of torpedoes sent &quot;Shoka Maru&quot; to the bottom. The patrol ended at Fremantle on 11 June. She was credited with six ships sunk for 19,500 tons; postwar, this was reduced to three for 7,500 tons.

=== Third patrol ===
Her third war patrol, conducted from 17 July to 10 September 1942, took &quot;Tautog&quot; to the coast of Indochina, where (in part due to torpedo shortages) she laid mines. The hunting was poor, and she sank only one ship, &quot;Ohio Maru&quot; (5,900 tons), on 6 August.

=== Fourth patrol ===
&quot;Tautog&quot; was refitted by at Albany, south of Fremantle. Again loaded with mines, the submarine put to sea 8 October 1942. On 20 October, her lookouts spotted the dim outline of a ship through a rain squall. Quickly submerging, the submarine determined that the ship was a 75-ton fishing schooner. &quot;Tautog&quot; prepared for battle, surfaced, closed the range, and fired a shot from her deck gun across the schooner&#x27;s bow; the target hove to. The stranger broke the Japanese colors and hoisted a signal flag. Investigation revealed a Japanese crew and four Filipinos on board. The Filipinos swam over to the submarine and later enlisted in the United States Navy. The Japanese were ordered to take to their boats but refused to do so. Three shells fired in the schooner&#x27;s stern disabled her rudder and propeller. The Japanese then launched a boat, were given water, and directed to the nearest land. When &quot;Tautog&quot; opened fire to sink the ship, several more Japanese emerged and scrambled into the boat. Ten more rounds left the schooner a burning hulk.

On 27 October, &quot;Tautog&quot; tracked a passenger-cargo ship until dark and launched two torpedoes into her. A fire started in the target aft, her bow rose into the air, and the unidentified ship sank within a few minutes (tentatively identified as the &quot;Hokuango Maru&quot; formerly Chinese vessel &quot;Pei An&quot; ) The next day, a spread of torpedoes fired at another merchantman turned out to be duds; their impacts on the target which could be heard in the sub. However, escort ships had seen their tracks, and the submarine received a thorough depth charging which caused no serious damage. During the night of 2 November, &quot;Tautog&quot; laid mines off Haiphong, Indochina, with several exploding as they were emplaced. On 11 November, she launched a torpedo at another passenger/cargo ship. It missed and alerted an escort which gave &quot;Tautog&quot; a severe depth charge attack. Five explosions close aboard caused extensive minor damage. The submarine returned to Fremantle ten days later for repair and refit. She was credited with one ship of 5,100 tons; postwar, it was reduced to 4,000 tons.

===Fifth patrol===
Her fifth war patrol, from 15 December 1942 to 30 January 1943, took &quot;Tautog&quot; to the Java Sea, near Ambon Island, Timor Island, and Celebes Island. She contacted a freighter in Ombai Strait on 24 December and tracked her until 03:06 the next morning when she fired three stern tubes. Two hits sent &quot;Banshu Maru Number 2&quot; to the bottom. &quot;Tautog&quot; went deep and began retiring westward; enemy patrol boats kept her down for ten hours before they withdrew.

That night, &quot;Tautog&quot; was headed for Alors Strait when she sighted a ship (thought to be a freighter) coming west, accompanied by an escort. The targets suddenly turned toward &quot;Tautog&quot; and were recognized as an antisubmarine warfare team. The submarine went deep but still received a severe pounding. On 5 January 1943, &quot;Tautog&quot; sighted a sail off her port bow and promptly closed the ship. It turned out to be a native craft with a dozen Muslim sailors, four women, several babies, some chickens, and a goat on board. After he had examined the ship&#x27;s papers, &quot;Tautog&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer, William B. Sieglaff, allowed the vessel to resume its voyage. On 9 January at 08:38, &quot;Tautog&quot; (relying on ) sighted &quot;Natori&quot;, a Nagara-class cruiser off Ambon Island, at a range of about . Three minutes later, the submarine fired her first torpedo. At 09:43, her crew heard a loud explosion, and sonar reported the cruiser&#x27;s screws had stopped. In the next few minutes, as the cruiser got underway at reduced speed, &quot;Tautog&quot; scored two more hits, while the cruiser opened fire on her periscope with guns, preventing her from tracking the target for another attack; the cruiser limped into Ambon.

Later in the patrol, in the Salajar Strait, &quot;Tautog&quot; spotted a second cruiser (again thanks to ), and launched four torpedoes in heavy seas; all missed. She sighted a freighter on 22 January in the Banda Sea, and three of the submarine&#x27;s torpedoes sent her to the bottom. The victim was later identified as &quot;Hasshu Maru&quot;, a former Dutch passenger-cargo ship which had been taken over by the Japanese. &quot;Tautog&quot; then headed for Fremantle, where she was greeted warmly for her &quot;extreme aggressiveness.&quot; She was credited with two ships sunk for 6,900 tons; postwar, this was limited to two of 2,900.

===Sixth patrol===

&quot;Tautog&quot;&#x27;s next patrol was conducted in Makassar Strait and around Balikpapan (where she again laid mines) from 24 February 1943 to 19 April. On 17 March, she sighted a grounded tanker with topside damage from an air attack. One torpedo, well placed near the stern, produced a secondary explosion, and the ship settled by the stern. &quot;Tautog&quot; expended three additional torpedoes on a freighter, but missed. On 9 April in the Celebes Sea off Boston Island, &quot;Tautog&quot; contacted a convoy of five ships. She sank the 5,214-ton freighter &quot;Penang Maru&quot; with three torpedoes, then the destroyer &quot;Isonami&quot; (1,750 tons) as it rescued crew from the &quot;Penang Maru&quot; with three more and missed with three. During this patrol, in four battle surfaces to test her new gun (only the third 5&quot;/25 cal pirated from an old V-boat,) &quot;Tautog&quot; also sank a schooner, a sailboat, and a motor sampan. Despite five torpedo and four gun attacks, however, she only sank two confirmed ships for 7,000 tons (wartime, 6,800).

===Seventh patrol===
&quot;Tautog&quot; stood out of Fremantle on 11 May 1943 and headed for a patrol area that included the Flores Sea, the Gulf of Boni, the Molucca Sea, the Celebes Sea, and the Moru Gulf. On 20 May, she sank a sampan with her deck guns. On 6 June, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a cargo ship off the entrance to Basalin Strait. The first torpedo scored a hit 20 seconds after being fired and a yellowish-green flash went up amidships of &quot;Shinei Maru&quot; as she went down. &quot;Tautog&quot; sank the 4,474-ton cargo ship &quot;Meiten Maru&quot; on 20 June, prior to ending her 53-day patrol at Pearl Harbor. This patrol was no more successful; despite six torpedo and three gun attacks, she only sank two confirmed ships for 14,300 tons (reduced to 5,300 tons postwar). The submarine was then routed back to the United States for an overhaul at Hunter&#x27;s Point Navy Yard. She held refresher training when the yard work was completed and got underway for Hawaii.

===Eighth patrol===
On 7 October 1943, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed Pearl Harbor to patrol in waters near the Palau Islands. On 22 October, she surfaced near Fais Island to shell a phosphate plant. She sank &quot;Submarine Chaser Number 30&quot; on 4 November. and subsequently damaged a tanker and three cargo ships. With all torpedoes expended, &quot;Tautog&quot; tracked a convoy for two days while radioing its position back to Pearl Harbor before she returned to Midway Island on 18 November.

===Ninth patrol===
&quot;Tautog&quot;&#x27;s ninth war patrol began on 12 December 1943 and took her to Japanese home waters, southeast of Shikoku Island and along the southern coast of Honshū. On 27 December, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a freighter and made a similar attack on a passenger ship. However, she never learned the results of these attacks since enemy escorts forced her to go deep and kept her down for four hours while they rained 99 depth charges on her. On 3 January 1944, &quot;Tautog&quot; tracked a cargo ship off the mouth of the Kumano Kawa River, approximately one-half mile from the seawall. She fired a spread of three torpedoes, turned, and headed for deep water. The submarine ran up her periscope, but an explosion filled the air with debris and obscured &quot;Saishu Maru&quot; from view as the freighter sank. The sound of approaching high-speed propellers and a closing patrol plane convinced the submarine that it was time to depart.

The next day, &quot;Tautog&quot; made radar contact with a ship and tracked the target while working toward a good firing position. A profligate spread of six torpedoes produced four hits which broke &quot;Usa Maru&quot; in half. When last seen, the cargoman&#x27;s bow and stern were both in the air. On 11 January, &quot;Tautog&quot; intercepted two freighters and launched three torpedoes at the first and larger, and one at the second. Escorts forced the submarine deep, but timed explosions indicated a hit on each ship. &quot;Tautog&quot; was later credited with inflicting medium damage to &quot;Kogyo Maru&quot;. She returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit by on 30 January, credited with two ships for 9,700 tons (postwar, 6,000).

===Tenth patrol===
&quot;Tautog&quot;&#x27;s assignment for her tenth war patrol took her to the cold waters of the northern Pacific near the Kuril Islands, from Paramushiro south to the main islands of Japan and the northeast coast of Hokkaidō. The submarine topped off with fuel at Midway and entered her patrol area on 5 March 1944. Her only casualty of the war occurred that day. While several members of her crew were doing emergency work on deck, a giant wave knocked them all off their feet and swept one man, newly assigned Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate R. A. Laramee, overboard; a search for him proved fruitless.

On 13 March, &quot;Tautog&quot; tracked a freighter until she reached a good position for an attack and then launched three torpedoes from , of which two hit and stopped &quot;Ryua Maru&quot;. The target refused to sink, even after &quot;Tautog&quot; fired four more torpedoes into &quot;the rubber ship&quot;. To avoid wasting more precious torpedoes, the submarine surfaced and finished the job with her 5&quot; gun. While she was attempting this, another ship came over the horizon to rescue survivors. Leaving the bait sitting, &quot;Tautog&quot; dived and began a submerged approach, firing a spread of three torpedoes; cargo ship &quot;Shojen Maru&quot; sank, more quickly than her inexplicably durable sister. As the sub headed homeward on the night of 16 March, &quot;Tautog&quot; made radar contact on a convoy of seven ships off Hokkaidō. She maneuvered into position off the enemy&#x27;s starboard flank so that two ships were almost overlapping and launched four torpedoes. After watching the first one explode against the nearer ship, &quot;Tautog&quot; was forced deep by an escort, but heard two timed explosions and breaking-up noises accompanied by more explosions. The American submarine pursued the remaining ships and attacked again from their starboard flank, firing three torpedoes at a medium-sized freighter and four at another ship. A Japanese destroyer closed the submarine, forced her deep, and subjected her to a depth charge attack for one and one-half hours. &quot;Tautog&quot; was officially credited with sinking &quot;Shirakumo&quot; (1,750 tons) and the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Nichiren Maru&quot;, bringing her total for the patrol to five ships for 17,700 tons (reduced postwar to four for 11,300), one of the most aggressive, and successful, of the war. She returned to Midway on 23 March.

===Eleventh patrol===
During her next patrol, from 17 April to 21 May 1944, &quot;Tautog&quot; returned to the Kuril Islands. On 2 May, she sighted a cargo ship in a small harbor between Banjo To and Matsuwa To. The submarine launched four torpedoes from a range of . One hit obscured the target. An hour later, &quot;Tautog&quot; fired two more and scored another hit. The 5,973-ton Army cargo ship &quot;Ryoyo Maru&quot; settled in of water, decks awash. The next morning, &quot;Tautog&quot; made radar contact in a heavy fog, closing the enemy ship and firing four torpedoes; two hit the target. The submarine circled for a follow-up shot, but this was difficult as the water was covered with gasoline drums, debris, and life rafts. When &quot;Tautog&quot; last saw &quot;Fushimi Maru&quot; (5,000 tons) through the fog, her bow was in the air. On 8 May, amid &quot;swarms of ships&quot; the submarine contacted a convoy bound for Esan Saki. She fired torpedoes at the largest ship. One hit slowed the target, and two more torpedoes left &quot;Miyazaki Maru&quot; (4,000 tons) sinking by the stern. Escorts forced &quot;Tautog&quot; deep and depth charged her for seven hours without doing any damage. At dawn on 9 May, she fired on another freighter, missing. Three days later, the submarine fired her last three torpedoes at &quot;Banei Maru Number 2&quot; (1,100 tons) and watched her disappear in a cloud of smoke. When &quot;Tautog&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, she was credited with four ships sunk for 20,500 tons (postwar reduced to 16,100).

===Twelfth patrol===
On 23 June 1944, &quot;Tautog&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Japanese waters to patrol the east coasts of Honshū and Hokkaidō. On 8 July, she stopped a small freighter dead in the water with one spread of torpedoes and followed with another spread that sank the ship. A lone survivor, taken on board the submarine, identified the ship as &quot;Matsu Maru&quot; which was transporting a load of lumber from Tokyo to Muroran. The next day, &quot;Tautog&quot; was patrolling on the surface near Simusu Shima, when she sighted a ship coming over the horizon. She submerged, closed the range, identified the ship as a coastal steamer. Surfacing, the sub fired 21 5&quot; shells into the target, starting a fire and causing an explosion that blew off the target&#x27;s stern. She then rescued six survivors from a swamped lifeboat who identified their ship as the &quot;Hokoriu Maru&quot;, en route from the Bonin Islands to Tokyo laden with coconut oil.

On 2 August, &quot;Tautog&quot; sighted several ships off Miki Saki. She launched three torpedoes at a freighter from a range of . The first hit caused a secondary explosion which obscured the target, and the second raised a column of black smoke. When the air cleared, the cargo ship &quot;Konei Maru&quot; had sunk. The submarine was briefly attacked by escorts but evaded them and set her course for Midway. &quot;Tautog&quot; arrived there on 10 August, credited with a disappointing two ships for 4,300 tons (postwar reduced to 2,800); she was routed to the United States for overhaul.

===Thirteenth patrol===
&quot;Tautog&quot; was back in Pearl Harbor in early December and, on 17 December 1944, began her 13th and last war patrol. She called at Midway and Saipan before taking her patrol station (in company with ) in the East China Sea. On 17 January 1945, &quot;Tautog&quot; sighted a ship heading toward her. She attained a position and fired a spread of three torpedoes. One hit blew off the enemy&#x27;s bow. She fired another torpedo from a range of ; and the loaded troopship, &quot;Transport Number 15&quot;, disintegrated. The bright moonlight of 20 January disclosed an enemy ship at a range of . &quot;Tautog&quot; maneuvered to silhouette the target against the moon and attacked with two torpedoes and then watched the ship sink. The submarine approached the wreckage and rescued one survivor who identified the ship as the motor torpedo boat tender &quot;Shuri Maru&quot; (1,800 tons), &quot;en route&quot; from Tsingtao to Sasebo. The next day, &quot;Tautog&quot; damaged a tanker but could not evaluate the damage as she had to evade enemy escorts that were approaching. On her way back to Midway Island, the submarine sank a wooden trawler with her deck guns. Her score for the patrol was three ships for 8,500 tons (postwar, two for 3,300).

&quot;Tautog&quot; completed her patrol at Midway on 1 February 1945 and was assigned to training duty. On 2 March, the submarine shifted her operations to Pearl Harbor to assist aircraft in anti-submarine warfare for one month before heading for the United States. She reached San Diego on 9 April and operated in conjunction with the University of California&#x27;s Department of War Research in experimenting with new equipment which it had developed to improve submarine safety. On 7 September, she headed for San Francisco to join the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her orders were subsequently modified, and she got underway on 31 October for the East Coast. &quot;Tautog&quot; arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 18 November and was decommissioned on 8 December 1945.

==Fate==
Plans to use &quot;Tautog&quot; as a target during atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946 were cancelled, and she was assigned to the Ninth Naval District on 9 May 1947 as a reserve training ship. The submarine was towed to Wisconsin and arrived at Milwaukee on 26 December 1947. She provided immobile service at the Great Lakes Naval Reserve Training Center for the next decade.

&quot;Tautog&quot; was placed out of service and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 September 1959. On 15 November 1959, she was sold to the Bultema Dock and Dredge Company of Manistee, Michigan, for scrap.

<doc id="420890" wikidata="Q2220035" url="?curid=420890" title="2004 Georgian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Georgia on January 4, 2004. The election followed the resignation of former President Eduard Shevardnadze. As expected, the main opposition leader, Mikhail Saakashvili, was soon shown by exit polls to be heading for an overwhelming victory. According to preliminary results issued on January 6 by the Central Election Commission, Saakashvili won over 97% of the votes cast.

The other candidates received less than 2% each. They were former presidential envoy to the Imereti region Temur Shashiashvili, leader of the Lawyers of Georgia Party Kartlos Garibashvili, one of the leaders of the political organization &quot;Mdzleveli&quot;, Zurab Kelekhsashvili, the President of the Coalition of Non-Government Organisations of the Disabled Zaza Sikharulidze, and leader of the &quot;David Agmashenebeli Party&quot; Roin Liparteliani.

==Results==
Early on 5 January Saakashvili claimed victory, although no official figures had been released at that time. He thanked his supporters, who were gathered in the Philharmonic Hall in Tbilisi, and also thanked the voters. &quot;The whole of Georgia has won,&quot; he said.

&quot;The primary tasks to be implemented from the first days of my presidency include introduction of a Prime Minister&#x27;s post, appointment of a date for parliamentary elections and implementation of anti-corruption measures in the country,&quot; Saakashvili said.

==Aftermath==
Saakashvili was inaugurated as President in Tbilisi on January 25.

<text>The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art is a museum devoted to the art of the picture book and especially the children&#x27;s book. It is a member of Museums10 and is adjacent to the campus of Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. The Carle was founded in 2002 by Eric and Barbara Carle, and designed by Juster Pope Frazier Architects.

==History==
Together with his wife Barbara, Eric Carle, the author and illustrator of more than 70 books, including the 1969 classic &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot;, founded the museum. It was the first full-scale museum in the United States devoted to national and international picture book art. The Museum&#x27;s stated goal is to foster connections between visual and verbal literacy and to provide visitors of all ages and backgrounds with the opportunity to explore their own creativity and the confidence to appreciate and enjoy art of every kind.

==Exhibitions==
The museum includes three rotating galleries, each housing picture book art. The West Gallery is devoted to the work of Eric Carle, while the East and Central galleries present the work of numerous picture book artists.

==Public Art Program==
The Art Studio at the Museum is open to visitors of all ages during regular Museum hours and supports the aims of the Museum by encouraging making, appreciating, and thinking about art. Activities and materials change regularly and are inspired by the Museum&#x27;s exhibitions. The Public Art Program is Free with Museum Admission.

==Programs &amp; events==
Designed for classroom teachers, librarians, art teachers, and others interested in engaging students in the visual arts and the art of the book, the Museum&#x27;s professional development programs emphasize teaching through the arts and encourage critical and creative thinking.

The Carle Honors is an annual awards and fundraising event hosted by the museum. Each year the event honors artists and authors who have made an impact in the genre of picture books. Works of art are also auctioned to benefit the museum.

==Benefit publications==
In 2009, Putnam/Philomel published &quot;Artist To Artist: 23 Major Illustrators Talk to Children about Their Art&quot;, with contributors including Mitsumasa Anno, Quentin Blake, Carle, Tomie dePaola, Leo Lionni, Barry Moser, Robert Sabuda, Maurice Sendak and Rosemary Wells. All profits from the book went to benefit the museum.

<text>The sedia gestatoria (, literally &#x27;chair for carrying&#x27;) or gestatorial chair is a ceremonial throne on which popes were carried on shoulders until 1978, which was later replaced outdoors in part with the popemobile. It consists of a richly adorned, silk-covered armchair, fastened on a &quot;&quot;, on each side of which are two gilded rings; through these rings pass the long rods with which twelve footmen (&quot;palafrenieri&quot;), in red uniforms, carry the throne on their shoulders. On prior occasions, as in the case of Pope Stephen III, popes were carried on the shoulders of men.
The &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; is an elaborate variation on the sedan chair. Two large fans (&quot;flabella&quot;) made of white ostrich feathers—a relic of the ancient liturgical use of the &quot;flabellum&quot;, mentioned in the &quot;Constitutiones Apostolicae&quot;—were carried at either side of the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot;.

==History==

It was used in the solemn ceremonies of the coronation of a new pope until the enthronement ceremony was abandoned altogether. It also was used for solemn entries of the pope to St. Peter&#x27;s or to public consistories. In the first case, three bundles of tow were burnt before the newly elected pontiff, who sits on the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot;, while a master of ceremonies says: &quot;Pater Sancte, sic transit gloria mundi&quot; (Holy Father, so passes the glory of the world). The custom of carrying the newly elected pope, and formerly in some countries, a newly elected bishop to his church, can be traced back centuries and is comparable with the Roman use of the &quot;sella curulis&quot;, on which newly elected consuls were carried through the city.

Magnus Felix Ennodius, Bishop of Pavia, records in his &quot;Apologia pro Synodo&quot;, &quot;Gestatoriam sellam apostolicae confessionis&quot;, alluding to the Cathedra S. Petri, still preserved in the choir of St. Peter&#x27;s at Rome. This is a portable wooden armchair, inlaid with ivory, with two iron rings on each side.

Besides the use of the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; at the coronation of the pope (which seems to date from the beginning of the sixteenth century) it served in the past on different other occasions, for instance when the pope received the yearly tribute of the Kingdom of Naples and of the other fiefs, and also, at least since the fifteenth century, when he carried the Blessed Sacrament publicly, in which case the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; took a different form, a table being fixed in front of the throne. Pius X made use of this on the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress at Rome in 1905.

== Discontinuance ==
Pope John Paul I initially declined to use the ceremonial throne carried on shoulders, along with several other symbols of papal authority, but was eventually convinced that it was necessary to make him visible to the crowds in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square. He was the last pope to use the portable throne.

Pope John Paul II discontinued the use of a throne carried on shoulders in 1978. Neither of his successors, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, has revived it.

<text>A 4-8-8-4 in the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, is a locomotive with a four-wheel leading truck, two sets of eight driving wheels, and a four-wheel trailing truck. Only one model of locomotives has ever used this wheel configuration, and that is commonly known as &quot;Union Pacific Big Boys&quot; after the railroad that operated them.

Other equivalent classifications are:
* UIC classification: &#x27;2DD2&#x27; (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
* French locomotive classification: &#x27;240+042&#x27;
* Turkish locomotive classification: &#x27;46+46&#x27;
* Swiss classification: &#x27;4/6+4/6&#x27;

The equivalent UIC classification is refined to (2′D)D2′ for simple articulated locomotives.

A similar wheel arrangement exists for Garratt locomotives, but is referred to as since both engine units swivel.

4-8-8-4 Big Boys were only produced for the Union Pacific Railroad. Twenty-five such engines were built between 1941 and 1944, numbered 4000 to 4024. Eight of these locomotives survive, seven of which are on static public display at various sites in the United States. Union Pacific announced plans in August 2013 to restore No. 4014 to operation for use in mainline excursion service. No. 4014 underwent restoration between 2016 and 2019, and completed its first post-restoration test run on May 2, 2019.

The UP Big Boys were an expansion of the &quot;Challenger&quot; type articulated locomotive. Adding four driving wheels increased the pulling power of the locomotive and reduced the need for helper locomotives over steep grades. Although their wheels were an inch (25.4 mm) smaller than those of the Challengers, they were still able to sustain similar high speeds.

Other American railroads considered buying 4-8-8-4s, including the Western Pacific Railroad, which already rostered large 2-8-8-2s and 4-6-6-4s, but diesel locomotives were gaining popularity and soon were able to displace these Big Boy locomotives.

<text>Gholamhossein Mosahab (October 13, 1910 – 1979) was an Iranian mathematician and logician whose works have been praised by other scholars such as Iraj Afshar and Najaf Daryabandari. Being fluent in Persian, Arabic, French and English, he studied in Iran, France and England; and received his PhD from Cambridge University. He was the founder of Mosahab Institute of Mathematics, Teacher Training University and was the director of the Institute of Mathematics of Kharazmi University from 1972-1974.

During the 1950s, when Persian scientific typography was flourishing, Mosahab invented a left slanted right-to-left font style that he named the &quot;Iranic&quot; &quot;font&quot;. This term is still commonly used by typographers in Iran, often as a general term for any left slanted font.

In 1955, Mosahab&#x27;s &quot;Madkhale Manteghe Soorat&quot; (Introduction to Formal Logic) was the first scholarly writing in mathematical logic to be published in Iran. This work was given a positive review in 1957 by L. A. Zadeh in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;. Mosahab&#x27;s most famous work in non-mathematical society is as the author of &quot;The Persian Encyclopedia&quot;, written in the Persian language and consisting of 3 volumes. His methods of organizing and categorizing are still in use. The 1996 publication of &quot;The Persian Encyclopedia&quot; gave credited authorship to himself, Ahmad Aram and Mahmoud Mosahab.

On June 28, 2009 it was announced that the 100th book released from the Society for the Appreciation of Cultural Works and Dignitaries had been allocated to the life, scientific and cultural works of the late Gholamhossien Mosahab. This tribute is written by Pegah Hajjan. In it are many of Mosahab&#x27;s published works including an article entitled &quot;The First Trigonometry Book&quot;, as well as appraisals from other scholars.

He is the founder of the Institute of Mathematical Research (IMR) which is still known as one of the most important Iranian mathematical centers. The Institute of Mathematical Research started its work in October 1965 under the direction of Mosahab, as a semi-independent institute affiliated with Tarbiat Moaalem University. His sister Shams ol-Moluk was one of the first two women appointed to the Senate.

<doc id="420908" wikidata="Q1963059" url="?curid=420908" title="Ileana Cosânzeana">
<text>Ileana Cosânzeana is a figure in Romanian mythology. She is represented as a beautiful and good-natured princess or daughter of an Emperor, or described as a fairy with immense powers.

==Names==
According to professor Nina Cuciuc, her name can also be translated or written as the following: Cosînzeana, Cosenzeana, Sânziana, Sînziana, Ileana Kossinzana, Hélène Cossinzana and Ileana Cosînzeana Sora Soarelui (&quot;Sister of the Sun&quot;). She can also be described as &quot;Queen of Flowers&quot;.

According to Adela Ileana Draucean, the name Ileana derives from Elena, and &quot;cosânzeana&quot; is linked to &quot;sânziană&quot;, a Romanian holiday and another term to designate fairies in Romanian mythology.

Folklorist Lazar Saineanu translated her name into French as &quot;Hélène aux cheveux d&#x27;or&quot; (sic) (&quot;Helen with Golden Hair&quot;).

Romanian linguist Sorin Paliga also lists several alternate names for the character: &quot;Ileana Simziana&quot;, &quot;Floarea Florilor&quot; (&quot;the Flower of Flowers&quot;); &quot;Frumoasa lumii&quot; (&quot;The Beauty of the World&quot;); &quot;Zâna dobrozâna&quot; (&quot;zână&quot;, from Latin &quot;Diana&quot;, meaning &#x27;fairy&#x27;, and, according to him, the Slavic word &quot;dobr&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;). She is sometimes called &quot;Rora&quot; and &quot;Rozuna&quot;, which, according to Paliga, contains the word for &quot;dew&quot;, which - he argues - connects her to a dawn and vegetation deity. Another theory proposes partial origin from a Late Latin &quot;Constantiana&quot;, perhaps influenced by the Greek pronunciation &quot;*Cosandiana&quot;. This may be due to an association with Saint Helena, the mother of the emperor Constantine the Great, later influenced by &quot;sânziană&quot; and associated with fairies.

==In folklore==
In Romanian folklore, Ileana is the original concept of feminine beauty, the most beautiful amongst the fairies: her eyes look like the sun, her body is like the sea, and her garments are made of flowers. Pearls and gold flow out of her mouth when she sings. She is also said to use her power of white magic to heal or revive. Ileana Cosânzeana signifies the most poetic imagination of Romanian genius. She personifies the beauty, the youth, and the angelic soul, in one word, the perfection of humanity. She is a mythical character with supernatural powers and with symbolic features. Ileana Cosânzeana succeeds in defeating the evil forces because she is brave, smart, modest and diligent.

===Ileana as the moon===
Ileana Cosanzeana is &quot;the girl with golden hair and azure eyes&quot; and, argues professor Adela Ileana, represents the &quot;female counterpart&quot; to &quot;the solar male archetype&quot;: Prince Făt-Frumos. On the other hand, several scholars argue for a lunar aspect of Ileana Cosanzeana, also due to her possible etymology that connects her to the Roman goddess Diana.

The moon is also said to have been worshipped as Ileana Sanziana. Romanian folklorist Marcu Beza stated that the moon appears as the &quot;Sister of the Sun&quot; in &quot;a popular&quot; Romanian Christmas carol (colinda), and also in a ballad of Transylvania.

In a legend collected by Tereza Stratilesco, the sun wants to marry, but cannot find a suitable wife. He sights a group of nine maidens, including Ileana Simziana, &quot;the sister of the sun&quot;. She tries to dissuade him to marry his own sister by setting difficult tasks for him. Meanwhile, Ileana blesses herself with the sign of the cross and dives into the sea, becoming a barbel. The sun orders fishermen to get her, but they only find the fish. Saints take pity on her, take her off the sea and to see Adam and Eve, who &quot;polish her&quot; and name her &quot;Luna&quot;. God sets her as the counterpart of the sun.

Beza also reported a version of the story collected by fellow folklorist G. Dem. Teodorescu, where the moon tries to stall the wedding by asking the Sun to create an iron bridge over the Black Sea and a ladder to the sky.

===Similar characters===
Romanian folklorist Lazar Saineanu compared Romanian Ileana Cosanzeana to Albanian Bukura e dheut (&quot;Beauty of the Earth&quot;) and the Hungarian Tündér Ilona (&quot;Fairy Elena&quot;).

==In tales==
In some tales &quot;Ileana Cosânzeana&quot; is the fairy of the Spring flowers, who gives each flower its perfume, although she also has the power to take it back. The elves love her, as do the flowers; even the wind loves Ileana, but he can never catch her. In the myth, she is a beautiful princess kidnapped by the &quot;Zmeu&quot; (a Dragon equivalent), who locks her in his castle and waits for her to give in to his marriage proposal. She is saved by Făt-Frumos, who is analogous to Prince Charming. Făt-Frumos is tested by many trials as he makes his way to Ileana Cosânzeana. Finally, he fights the &quot;Zmeu&quot;, beats him, and frees Ileana Cosânzeana. They both live happily ever after.

Ileana Cosânzeana is, in some tales, described to have an elder brother – Verea Viteazul.

In the tale &quot;Ileana Cosânzana, din cosita floarea-i canta, noua imparatii asculta&quot; (&quot;Ileana Cosanzeana, the Flower that she Has in Her Braided Hair is Singing, Nine Kingdoms are Listening&quot;), princess Ileana Cosanzeana is associated with music by the way of a magical flower that produces heavenly songs.

==Related characters==
Another similarly named fairy maiden exists in Romanian folklore: &quot;Iana Sanziana&quot; (ro). According to Adela Ileana, they cannot be confused for each other, despite some similarities: both are indeed fairies, but Iana is a celestial or astral character, while Ileana Cosanzeana is &quot;a human, chthonic one&quot;. Iana also shows features of a solar character, being the sister of the sun.

<text>Major-General Dr. Walter Robert Dornberger (6 September 1895 – 26 June 1980) was a German Army artillery officer whose career spanned World War I and World War II. He was a leader of Nazi Germany&#x27;s V-2 rocket programme and other projects at the Peenemünde Army Research Centre. After the war, the US Nazi scientist recruitment programme Operation Paperclip saw him move to the US, largely avoiding punishment for involvement in war crimes, to work for some decades in high positions in aerospace, including for Bell Aircraft and Boeing.

==Early life==

Dornberger was born in Gießen in 1895. In 1914 he enlisted in the German army during World War 1. In October 1918, as an artillery lieutenant, Dornberger was captured by United States Marines and spent two years in a French prisoner of war camp, mostly in solitary confinement because of repeated escape attempts. In the late 1920s, Dornberger completed an engineering course with distinction at the Berlin Technical Institute, and in the spring of 1930, Dornberger graduated after five years with an MS degree in mechanical engineering from the &quot;Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg&quot; in Berlin. In 1935, Dornberger received an honorary doctorate, which Col. Karl Emil Becker arranged as Dean of the new Faculty of Military Technology at the TH Berlin.

==Rocket development==
In April 1930, Dornberger was appointed to the Ballistics Council of the German Army (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;) Weapons Department as Assistant Examiner to secretly develop a military liquid-fuel rocket suitable for mass-production that would surpass the range of artillery. In the spring of 1932, Dornberger, his commander (Captain Ritter von Horstig), and Col. Karl Emil Becker visited the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR)&#x27;s leased &quot;Raketenflugplatz&quot; (English: &quot;Rocket Flight Field&quot;) and subsequently issued a contract for a demonstration launch. On 21 December 1932, Captain Dornberger watched a rocket motor explode at Kummersdorf while Wernher von Braun tried to light it with a flaming gasoline can at the end of a pole.

In 1933, &quot;Waffenamt Prüfwesen&quot; (&quot;Wa Prüf&quot;, English: &quot;Weapons Testing&quot;) 1/1, under the &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (Army Weapons Department), commenced work under the direction of Colonel Ing. h. c. Dornberger. Dornberger also took over his last &quot;military&quot; command on 1 October 1934, a powder-rocket training battery at Königsbrück. In May 1937, Dornberger and his ninety-man organization were transferred from Kummersdorf to Peenemünde. In September 1942, Dornberger was given two posts: coordinating the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket development programs and directing active operations. The first successful test launch of a V-2 was the third test launch on 3 October 1942. The launch sites for V2 rockets in the Netherlands were built by Dutch slave labour, with Dornberger having the workers killed once each project was completed. He also organised a brothel for the German launch crews, with 20 Dutch women at a time forced into prostitution; each group was executed after two weeks in order to maintain security.
In June 1943, in a speech to nearly 6,500 German employees and soldiers in Peenemünde, Dornberger blended traditional German patriotism with Nazi ideological motifs while also highlighting and reinforcing many of the unique factors that made missile development so successful at Peenemünde in the first place. By emphasizing the path-breaking nature of their work as well as its singular importance to the war effort, all while playing on the popular fear of the Soviet Union and the disdain for the Western Allies for bombing their cities into rubble, Dornberger composed a powerful message that would certainly appeal to many Peenemünders.

In the early morning of 7 July 1943, Ernst Steinhoff flew von Braun and Major-General Dornberger in his Heinkel He 111 to Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Führerhauptquartier&quot; &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; headquarters and the next day Hitler viewed the film of the successful V-2 test launch (narrated by von Braun) and the scale models of the Watten bunker and launching-troop vehicles:


In January 1944, Dornberger was named Senior Artillery Commander 191 and was headquartered at Maisons-Lafitte near Saint Germain, and in December 1944, Dornberger was given complete authority for anti-aircraft rocket development (&quot;Flak E Flugabwehrkanonenentwicklung&quot;). On 12 January 1945 on Dornberger&#x27;s proposal, Albert Speer replaced the Long-Range Weapons Commission with &quot;Working Staff Dornberger&quot;. In February 1945, Dornberger and staff relocated his headquarters from Schwedt-an-der-Oder to Bad Sachsa, then on 6 April 1945, from Bad Sachsa to &quot;Haus Ingeborg&quot; in Oberjoch near Hindelang in the Allgäu mountains of Bavaria.
Before going to the Alps, General Dornberger hid comprehensive V-2 documentation in a mine near Goslar, which were recovered by the US 332nd Engineer Regiment on 16 May 1945 by a secret action when Goslar was already occupied by the British Army.

On 2 May 1945, Dornberger, von Braun, and five other men departed from Haus Ingeborg and travelled through Gaicht Pass and towards the little Austrian village of Schattwald. They met American soldiers who convoyed the group to the Tyrolean town of Reutte for the night. 
At an internment camp after the war, known as &quot;CSDIC Camp 11&quot;, the British bugged Dornberger, who in conversation with &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Gerhard Bassenge (GOC Air Defences, Tunis &amp; Biserta) said that he and Wernher von Braun had realized in late 1944 that things were going wrong and had consequently communicated with the General Electric Corporation through the German Embassy in Portugal, with the intent of coming to some arrangement.

==Postwar==
In mid-August 1945, after taking part in Operation Backfire, Dornberger was escorted from Cuxhaven to London for interrogation by the British War Crimes Investigation Unit in connection with the use of slave labour in the production of V-2 rockets; he was subsequently transferred and detained for two years at Bridgend in South Wales.

Along with some other German rocket scientists, Dornberger was released and brought to the United States under the auspices of Operation Paperclip and worked for the United States Air Force for three years, developing guided missiles. From 1950 to 1965, he worked for the Bell Aircraft Corporation, where he worked on several projects, rising to the post of Vice-President. He played a major role in the creation of the North American X-15 aircraft and was a key consultant for the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar project. He also had a role in the creation of ideas and projects which, in the end, led to the creation of the Space Shuttle. Dornberger also developed Bell&#x27;s ASM-A-2, the world&#x27;s first guided nuclear air-to-surface missile developed for the Strategic Air Command. Dornberger advised West Germany on a European space program. During the 1950s he had some differences with von Braun and was instrumental in recruiting several engineers out of the Huntsville&#x27;s team for US Air Force projects. These included Krafft Ehricke, who later created the Centaur rocket stage and participated in several more defence projects.

Following retirement, Dornberger went to Mexico and later returned to West Germany, where he died in 1980 in Baden-Württemberg.

<doc id="420910" wikidata="Q1925894" url="?curid=420910" title="Delaware Valley">
<text>The Delaware Valley, sometimes referred to as Greater Philadelphia, the Philadelphia metropolitan area, or the Philadelphia tri-state area and locally and colloquially referred to as Philly–Jersey–Delaware, is a major metropolitan area in the Northeastern United States that centers on Philadelphia, the sixth-most populous city in the United States, and spans parts of four states: southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, northern Delaware, and the northern Eastern Shore of Maryland, though it is sometimes considered a tri-state region if northeastern Maryland is excluded. With a core of metropolitan statistical area population of 6.288 million residents and a combined statistical area population of 7.366 million as of the 2020 census, the Delaware Valley is the eighth-largest metropolitan region in the United States and the 68th-largest metropolitan region in the world.

In addition to Philadelphia, other major population centers in the Delaware Valley include Reading, Upper Darby Township, and Chester in Pennsylvania; Atlantic City, Camden, Vineland, and Cherry Hill in South Jersey; and Wilmington and Dover in Delaware. As of 2022, the Philadelphia metropolitan area&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) exceeds US$518 billion, making it the tenth-largest metropolitan economy in the nation.

The Delaware Valley has been influential in the nation&#x27;s history and economy and home to many people and sites significant to American culture, history, and politics. Philadelphia is sometimes known as &quot;The Birthplace of America&quot; in reference to its role as the revolutionary capital during the colonial era in which the Second Continental Congress gathered at Independence Hall and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, authorized the formation of the Continental Army, and appointed George Washington its commander to resist the British. After the Continental Army&#x27;s victory, Philadelphia served as the nation&#x27;s first capital for most of the 18th century until 1800, when construction of Washington, D.C. was completed. The U.S. Constitution, the world&#x27;s longest-standing body of federal law, was ratified at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1789.

The Delaware Valley is one of the nation&#x27;s leading regions for academia and academic research with a considerable number of globally-known and highly ranked universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, one of the nation&#x27;s eight Ivy League universities. Other major universities and colleges in the region include Drexel University, Thomas Jefferson University, Rowan University, Villanova University, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, Temple University, Rutgers University–Camden, La Salle University, the University of Delaware, Stockton University, and others. 

Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley are a biotechnology hub. As of 2024, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks as one of the Big Five U.S. venture capital hubs, facilitated by its proximity to both New York City&#x27;s entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems and to the federal regulatory environment of Washington, D.C. Elsewhere in the Delaware Valley, South Jersey has emerged as an East Coast epicenter for logistics and major warehouses. 

Culturally, the region is home to the dialect known as Philadelphia English, shares a unique cuisine known as Philadelphia cuisine, has played a formidable role in popular music, and is known for having one of the nation&#x27;s most passionate and devoted sports cultures centered around its five professional sports teams.

==Geography and population==
The Delaware Valley is geographically associated and proximate to the Delaware River and its three primary tributaries, the Schuylkill River, Lehigh River, and Brandywine Creek.

U.S. government agencies have reached various definitions of the Delaware Valley and metropolitan Philadelphia. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines metropolitan statistical area (MSAs), which are regions with relatively high population densities at their cores and close economic ties throughout their respective areas. MSAs are further combined into combined statistical areas (CSAs), reflecting commuting patterns. Neither is a formal administrative division.

===Metropolitan statistical area (MSA)===
As of the 2020 U.S. census, the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area is the seventh-largest MSA in the nation with 6,245,051 people. The MSA includes:
* Camden, NJ Metropolitan Division

===Combined statistical area (CSA)===
As of 2020, the Philadelphia–Reading–Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD CSA is the nation&#x27;s ninth-largest combined statistical area with a population of 7,379,700. Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area includes:
* Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington MSA (11 counties, as defined above)
* Berks County, Pennsylvania, comprising the Reading, PA MSA
* Atlantic County, New Jersey, comprising the Atlantic City-Hammonton, NJ MSA
* Cape May County, New Jersey, comprising the Ocean City, NJ MSA
* Cumberland County, New Jersey, comprising the Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ MSA
* Kent County, Delaware, comprising the Dover, DE MSA

===Statistical history===
When metropolitan areas were originally defined in 1950, most of the area now in the Delaware Valley was split between four metropolitan areas, or standard metropolitan areas, as they were then called. The Philadelphia SMA included Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania, and Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties in South Jersey. The Wilmington SMA included New Castle County in Delaware and Salem County in South Jersey. Berks County was designated as the Reading SMA and Atlantic County, New Jersey was the Atlantic City SMA.

In 1960, Cecil County, Maryland was added to what was now the Wilmington Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). In 1980, Cumberland County, New Jersey was defined as the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton SMSA.

In 1990, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton SMSAs were merged with the Trenton SMSA to form the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the same time, Cape May County, New Jersey was added to the Atlantic City SMSA. The &quot;Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton&quot; became obsolete one census later when Trenton, New Jersey was moved to the New York-Newark-Bridgeport CSA. The Philadelphia-Wilmington-Vineland CSA included the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Camden MSA and the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton MSA.

In 2000, Kent County, Delaware was designated the Dover MSA, and Kent County and Atlantic City were added to the Philadelphia CSA in 2010. As a result of new 2010 definitions, based on a threshold of 15% labor interchange between MSAs, two additional MSAs were added, Ocean City, New Jersey and Reading, Pennsylvania. The CSA to which they belong is known as Philadelphia-Reading-Camden.

=== Climate Types ===
All of it is Humid Subtropical

==Subregions==
The Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area includes sixteen counties in four states. The five Pennsylvania counties in the metropolitan statistical area are collectively known as Southeastern Pennsylvania. In addition to Philadelphia, major municipalities in Southeastern Pennsylvania include the inner suburbs of Upper Darby Township and Bensalem Township. Berks County, which forms its own MSA and contains the CSA&#x27;s second largest city, Reading, is occasionally not considered to be part of Southeastern Pennsylvania and is sometimes assigned to South Central Pennsylvania.

The seven New Jersey counties in the CSA are in South Jersey. Atlantic County, Cape May County, and Cumberland County each form their own respective metropolitan statistical areas. Atlantic City, Cape May County, New Jersey, and the southern Jersey Shore, including Margate City, Ventnor City, the Wildwoods, and Sea Isle City, are major tourist destinations for people from inside and outside of the Delaware Valley. Other major municipalities in South Jersey include Cherry Hill and Camden, which is across the Delaware River, east of Philadelphia. Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem Counties comprise the Delware River Region, one of seven officially recognized tourism regions by the New Jersey Department of Tourism.

The two counties of Delaware in the CSA constitute a majority of Delaware&#x27;s land mass and population. Wilmington is the most populous city in Delaware and the fifth-most populous municipality in the Delaware Valley. The lone Maryland county in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area is part of the region known as the Eastern Shore of Maryland.

Ethnically, Indians make up the largest foreign-born population in the greater Delaware Valley.

==Largest municipalities==

The following municipalities are all within the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and part of the Delaware Valley:

==Climate==
The Delaware Valley has four distinct seasons with ample precipitation and is divided by the 0 °C (32 °F) January isotherm. Philadelphia and the New Jersey portion of the area, almost all of the Delaware and Maryland portions, most of Delaware County and lower Bucks County, lowland southern Chester County, and some southern and lowland areas of Montgomery County have a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;.) PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University

Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and normally do vary widely within the Delaware Valley. The region has two ski resorts, Bear Creek Mountain Resort in Longswamp Township, Berks County and Spring Mountain Adventures in central Montgomery County.

Using the -3 °C January isotherm as a boundary, all of the Delaware Valley is humid subtropical. The hardiness zone in the region ranges from 6b in higher areas of Berks and northern Bucks Counties to 8a in Atlantic City and Cape May. 

Using the Trewartha climate classification system, which requires eight months to average at least 50 °F for the climate to be considered subtropical, the region only has seven such months, so the area considered &quot;Cfa&quot; by Köppen is oceanic (&quot;Do&quot;) in the Trewartha system.



==Economy==
As of 2021, the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area has a gross domestic product of $477.58 billion, the tenth-largest among the nation&#x27;s MSAs. The MSA&#x27;s nominal gross domestic product of $431 billion is comparable to countries, such as Belgium, Iran, and Thailand. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to the New York metropolitan area and its financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.

At least two educational institutions, Delaware Valley Regional High School in Alexandria Township, New Jersey, and Delaware Valley College in Doylestown Township, Pennsylvania, and a now defunct local newspaper, &quot;The Delaware Valley News&quot; in 
Frenchtown, New Jersey, are named for the region.

===Delaware Regional Planning Commission===
The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) serves all of the counties of the Delaware Valley MSA except for the counties in the Wilmington, DE-MD-NJ Metropolitan Division. However, in addition to the Delaware Valley, DVRPC&#x27;s jurisdiction includes Mercer County, New Jersey, which OMB classifies as the Trenton-Princeton, NJ MSA and part of the larger New York-Newark CSA.
==Colonial history==

The valley was the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape, who are recalled in place names throughout the region. The region became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland after the exploration of Delaware Bay in 1609. The Dutch called the Delaware River the &quot;Zuyd Rivier&quot;, or South River, and considered the lands along it banks and those of its bay to be the southern flank of its province of New Netherland. In 1638, it began to be settled by Swedes, Forest Finns, Dutch, and Walloons and became the colony of New Sweden, though this was not officially recognized by the Dutch Empire which re-asserted control in 1655. The area was taken by the English in 1664.
The name Delaware comes from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who had arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1610, just as original settlers were about to abandon it, and thus maintaining the English foothold on the North American continent. In the early 1700s, Huguenot refugees from France by way of Germany and then England began settling in the Delaware River Valley. Specifically, they left their mark in Hunterdon County, New Jersey (Frenchtown) and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

===Characteristics===

Philadelphia&#x27;s suburbs contain a high concentration of malls, the two largest of which have at least of office space, and at least of retail. These are the King of Prussia mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is the largest in the U.S. (leasable sq. feet of retail space), and the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was the first enclosed mall on the East Coast. In addition, the Christiana Mall in Newark, Delaware, is a popular destination due to its proximity to Interstate 95 and because of the availability of tax-free shopping in Delaware. Malls, office complexes, strip shopping plazas, expressways, and tract housing are common sights, and more and more continue to replace rolling countryside, farms, woods, and wetlands. However, due to strong opposition by residents and political officials, many acres of land have been preserved throughout the Delaware Valley. Older townships and large boroughs, such as Cheltenham, Norristown, Jenkintown, Upper Darby, and West Chester retain distinct community identities while engulfed in suburbia.

Mid-Atlantic American English and its subset, Philadelphia English, are two common dialects of American English in Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley.

==Politics==

Philadelphia is heavily Democratic, having voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1936. The surrounding suburban counties are key political areas in Pennsylvania, which itself is an important swing state in federal politics. South Jersey has consistently voted Democratic at the presidential level in recent years, although the region is slightly more Republican-leaning than North Jersey and has voted for Republicans at the state and local level. New Castle County&#x27;s Democratic lean and large share of Delaware&#x27;s population has tended to make Delaware as a whole vote for Democrats, while the less populous Kent County is more competitive. Recent well-known political figures from the Greater Philadelphia area include former U.S. President Joe Biden, former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and late former U.S. Senator Arlen Specter.

===Congressional districts===
The following congressional districts of the United States House of Representatives are located partly or entirely in the Delaware Valley CSA. &quot;Italicized&quot; counties are not part of the CSA.

Additionally, the Delaware Valley is represented in the United States Senate by the eight Senators from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

<text>The advanced multi-mission operations system (AMMOS) is a common set of services and tools created by the Interplanetary Network Directorate, a division of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, for use in JPL&#x27;s operation of spacecraft. These tools include a means by which mission planning and analysis can be undertaken, as well as developing pre-planned command sequences for the spacecraft. AMMOS also provides a means by which downlinked data can be displayed and manipulated, including key mission telemetry such as readings of temperature, pressure, power, and other critical indicators. This common toolset allows space missions to minimize the cost of developing operations infrastructure, which is very important in light of recent restricted spending by space agencies.

<text>In mathematics, an incidence matrix is a logical matrix that shows the relationship between two classes of objects, usually called an incidence relation. If the first class is &quot;X&quot; and the second is &quot;Y&quot;, the matrix has one row for each element of &quot;X&quot; and one column for each mapping from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. The entry in row &quot;x&quot; and column &quot;y&quot; is 1 if the vertex &quot;x&quot; is part of (called &quot;incident&quot; in this context) the mapping that corresponds to &quot;y&quot;, and 0 if it is not. There are variations; see below.

==Graph theory==
Incidence matrix is a common graph representation in graph theory. It is different to an adjacency matrix, which encodes the relation of vertex-vertex pairs.

===Undirected and directed graphs===

In graph theory an undirected graph has two kinds of incidence matrices: unoriented and oriented.

The &quot;unoriented incidence matrix&quot; (or simply &quot;incidence matrix&quot;) of an undirected graph is a formula_1 matrix &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are the numbers of vertices and edges respectively, such that
:formula_2

For example, the incidence matrix of the undirected graph shown on the right is a matrix consisting of 4 rows (corresponding to the four vertices, 1–4) and 4 columns (corresponding to the four edges, formula_3):
If we look at the incidence matrix, we see that the sum of each column is equal to 2. This is because each edge has a vertex connected to each end.

The &quot;incidence matrix&quot; of a directed graph is a formula_1 matrix &quot;B&quot; where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are the number of vertices and edges respectively, such that
:formula_5
(Many authors use the opposite sign convention.)

The &quot;oriented incidence matrix&quot; of an undirected graph is the incidence matrix, in the sense of directed graphs, of any orientation of the graph. That is, in the column of edge &quot;e&quot;, there is one 1 in the row corresponding to one vertex of &quot;e&quot; and one −1 in the row corresponding to the other vertex of &quot;e&quot;, and all other rows have 0. The oriented incidence matrix is unique up to negation of any of the columns, since negating the entries of a column corresponds to reversing the orientation of an edge.

The unoriented incidence matrix of a graph &quot;G&quot; is related to the adjacency matrix of its line graph &quot;L&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) by the following theorem:
: formula_6

where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;L&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)) is the adjacency matrix of the line graph of &quot;G&quot;, &quot;B&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the incidence matrix, and &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot; is the identity matrix of dimension &quot;m&quot;.

The discrete Laplacian (or Kirchhoff matrix) is obtained from the oriented incidence matrix &quot;B&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) by the formula
: formula_7

The integral cycle space of a graph is equal to the null space of its oriented incidence matrix, viewed as a matrix over the integers or real or complex numbers. The binary cycle space is the null space of its oriented or unoriented incidence matrix, viewed as a matrix over the two-element field.

===Signed and bidirected graphs===
The incidence matrix of a signed graph is a generalization of the oriented incidence matrix. It is the incidence matrix of any bidirected graph that orients the given signed graph. The column of a positive edge has a 1 in the row corresponding to one endpoint and a −1 in the row corresponding to the other endpoint, just like an edge in an ordinary (unsigned) graph. The column of a negative edge has either a 1 or a −1 in both rows. The line graph and Kirchhoff matrix properties generalize to signed graphs.

===Multigraphs===
The definitions of incidence matrix apply to graphs with loops and multiple edges. The column of an oriented incidence matrix that corresponds to a loop is all zero, unless the graph is signed and the loop is negative; then the column is all zero except for ±2 in the row of its incident vertex.

===Weighted graphs===

A weighted graph can be represented using the weight of the edge in place of a 1. For example, the incidence matrix of the graph to the right is:
===Hypergraphs===
Because the edges of ordinary graphs can only have two vertices (one at each end), the column of an incidence matrix for graphs can only have two non-zero entries. By contrast, a hypergraph can have multiple vertices assigned to one edge; thus, a general matrix of non-negative integers describes a hypergraph.

==Incidence structures==
The &quot;incidence matrix&quot; of an incidence structure &quot;C&quot; is a matrix &quot;B&quot; (or its transpose), where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are the number of &quot;points&quot; and &quot;lines&quot; respectively, such that if the point &quot;p&quot;i and line &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot; are incident and 0 otherwise. In this case, the incidence matrix is also a biadjacency matrix of the Levi graph of the structure. As there is a hypergraph for every Levi graph, and &quot;vice versa&quot;, the incidence matrix of an incidence structure describes a hypergraph.

===Finite geometries===
An important example is a finite geometry. For instance, in a finite plane, &quot;X&quot; is the set of points and &quot;Y&quot; is the set of lines. In a finite geometry of higher dimension, &quot;X&quot; could be the set of points and &quot;Y&quot; could be the set of subspaces of dimension one less than the dimension of the entire space (hyperplanes); or, more generally, &quot;X&quot; could be the set of all subspaces of one dimension &quot;d&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; the set of all subspaces of another dimension &quot;e&quot;, with incidence defined as containment.

===Polytopes===
In a similar manner, the relationship between cells whose dimensions differ by one in a polytope, can be represented by an incidence matrix.

===Block designs===
Another example is a block design. Here &quot;X&quot; is a finite set of &quot;points&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is a class of subsets of &quot;X&quot;, called &quot;blocks&quot;, subject to rules that depend on the type of design. The incidence matrix is an important tool in the theory of block designs. For instance, it can be used to prove Fisher&#x27;s inequality, a fundamental theorem of balanced incomplete 2-designs (BIBDs), that the number of blocks is at least the number of points. Considering the blocks as a system of sets, the permanent of the incidence matrix is the number of systems of distinct representatives (SDRs).

<doc id="420922" wikidata="Q312364" url="?curid=420922" title="Haing S. Ngor">
<text>Haing Somnang Ngor (Khmer: ហាំង សំណាង ង៉ោ; March 22, 1940 – February 25, 1996) was a Cambodian-born American actor. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Cambodian-American journalist Dith Pran in the biographical drama film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984). He was murdered in Los Angeles in 1996.

==Early life==
Haing Somnang Ngor was born on March 22, 1940, in Samrong Yong, a village in Cambodia, then part of French Indochina. His mother was Khmer, and his father was of Chinese descent.

Ngor trained as a gynecologist and obstetrician, practicing in Phnom Penh before the capture of the city by Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge in 1975. He had to conceal his education, medical skills, and even the fact that he wore glasses to avoid the new regime&#x27;s intense hostility to intellectuals and professionals. Ngor was expelled from Phnom Penh with the bulk of its two million inhabitants as part of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s idea Year Zero and sent to farm rice imprisoned with his wife, Chang My-Huoy, who required a cesarean section and died with the couple&#x27;s unborn child during labor in 1978 because it was impossible to perform the surgery without risking the whole family&#x27;s life. He survived three terms in prison, using his medical knowledge to keep himself alive by eating beetles, termites, and scorpions.

After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Ngor and his niece crawled to safety in a Red Cross refugee camp in Thailand, where he subsequently worked as a physician. The next year, they moved to the United States, where they settled in Los Angeles. Later in his life, Ngor was unable to resume his medical practice and did not remarry.

==Career==
Despite having no previous acting experience, Ngor was cast as Cambodian-American journalist Dith Pran in the biographical drama film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984)—for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, becoming the first actor of Asian descent to win the award and one of the only two amateur actors to win an Academy Award, following Harold Russell. Ngor was not initially interested in the role, but interviews with the filmmakers changed his mind, as he recalled that he promised his wife to tell Cambodia&#x27;s story to the world. After appearing in the film, he told &quot;People&quot;, &quot;I wanted to show the world how deep starvation is in Cambodia, how many people die under communist regime. My heart is satisfied. I have done something perfect.&quot;

In 1987, he published his autobiography, &quot;Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey&quot;, in which he described his life under the Khmer Rouge.

Ngor went on to appear in various other onscreen projects, most memorably in &quot;Vanishing Son&quot; (1994–1995) and the biographical war drama film &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; (1993). He also appeared in the Hong Kong action film &quot;Eastern Condors&quot; (1987).

Ngor appeared in a supporting role in the 1989 Vietnam War drama &quot;The Iron Triangle and&quot; guest-starred in a two-episode storyline on the acclaimed series &quot;China Beach&quot; (episodes &quot;How to Stay Alive in Vietnam 1 &amp; 2&quot;) as a wounded Cambodian prisoner of war who befriends Colleen McMurphy while under her care. Ngor guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; called &quot;The Savage / Duty and Honor&quot;.

In &quot;My Life&quot; (1993), Ngor portrayed Mr. Ho, a spiritual healer who provides guidance for Bob Jones (Michael Keaton) and his wife Gail (Nicole Kidman) after Bob is diagnosed with terminal cancer, months before the birth of the couple&#x27;s first child.

==Humanitarian work==
Ngor and his close friend Jack Ong established the Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation to assist in raising funds for Cambodian aid. As part of his humanitarian efforts, Ngor built an elementary school and operated a small sawmill that provided jobs and an income for local families.

==Personal life==
Ngor became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1986. He was a Buddhist.

== Death and legacy ==
On February 25, 1996, Ngor was shot and killed outside his home in Chinatown, Los Angeles. Three alleged members of the &quot;Oriental Lazy Boyz&quot; street gang, who had prior arrests for snatching purses and jewelry, were charged with the murder. They were tried together in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, though their cases were heard by three separate juries. Prosecutors argued that they killed Ngor because, after handing over his gold Rolex watch willingly, he refused to give them a locket that contained a photo of his late wife, My-Huoy. Defense attorneys suggested the murder was a politically motivated killing carried out by sympathizers of the Khmer Rouge. Kang Kek Iew, a former Khmer Rouge official on trial in Cambodia, claimed in November 2009 that Ngor was murdered on Pol Pot&#x27;s orders, but U.S. investigators did not find him credible.

Some criticized the theory that Ngor was killed in a bungled robbery, pointing to $2,900 in cash that had been left behind and that the thieves had not rifled his pockets. Why the thieves would have demanded his locket is not known; Ngor typically wore the locket next to his skin under his clothing, so it would not have been easily visible. , the locket had not been recovered.

All of the defendants were found guilty on April 16, 1998, the same day Pol Pot&#x27;s death was confirmed in Cambodia. Tak Sun Tan was sentenced to 56 years to life; Indra Lim to 26 years to life; and Jason Chan to life sentence without parole. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted Tak Sun Tan&#x27;s &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, finding that prosecutors had manipulated the jury&#x27;s sympathy by presenting false evidence. This decision was reversed, and the conviction was ultimately upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in July 2005.

Many Cambodians claimed they had a stake in his estate, with one woman claiming he had married her after coming to the United States. Most of Ngor&#x27;s Cambodian assets went to his younger brother, Chan Sarun, while his American assets were used up in legal fees staving off claims to his estate. He was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park, Whittier, California.

After the release of &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, Ngor had told a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, &quot;If I die from now on, OK! This film will go on for a hundred years.&quot;

Dith Pran, whom Ngor portrayed in &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, said of Ngor&#x27;s death, &quot;He is like a twin with me. He is like a co-messenger and right now I am alone.&quot;

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Georgia on 2 November 2003 alongside a constitutional referendum. According to statistics released by the Georgian Election Commission, the elections were won by a combination of parties supporting President Eduard Shevardnadze.

However, the results were annulled by the Georgia Supreme Court after the Rose Revolution on 25 November, following allegations of widespread electoral fraud and large public protests which led to the resignation of Shevardnadze. Fresh elections were held on 28 March 2004.

==Parties==
&quot;For a New Georgia&quot; was the electoral bloc that supported President Eduard Shevardnadze. The Revival Party was an ally of Shevardnadze. The National Movement (NM) was the party of opposition leader Mikhail Saakashvili.

==Conduct==
Reports of violence, voter intimidation and ballot box stuffing began coming in shortly after the polling stations opened. The biggest problem, however, was the voter lists prepared by the Georgian government. 
Mikhail Saakashvili was among tens of thousands who were denied the right to vote. His name, along with names of many thousands across the country, was missing from the voter list prepared by the Georgian government. Entire neighborhoods were mysteriously removed from the voter list in the areas where opposition was likely to do well.

Georgian analysts described the vote as &quot;the messiest and most chaotic election&quot; the country has ever had. 
&quot;The government did everything to make this election chaotic. I think there were also (those in) government (who) did not want this election to be orderly because they knew they would lose it,&quot; said Ghia Nodia of the Caucasus Institute for Democracy and Development.

An international mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) declared that the election fell short of international standards. 
&quot;These elections have, regrettably, been insufficient to enhance the credibility of either the electoral or the democratic process,&quot; said Bruce George, special co-ordinator of the OSCE chairman-in-office. Some 450 international observers from 43 countries monitored the polls in one of the largest and longest election observation missions in the OSCE&#x27;s history.

Supporting the allegations of electoral fraud were also exit polls conducted by an American company, Global Strategy, which showed that the opposition had won by a large margin, with the National Movement coming first with 20% and the government block polling only 14% of the vote.

<doc id="420927" wikidata="Q472054" url="?curid=420927" title="Amir Kabir">
<text>Mirza Taghi Khan-e Farahani (), better known as Amir Kabir (Persian: ‎; 9 January 1807 – 10 January 1852), was chief minister to Naser al-Din Shah Qajar for the first three years of his reign. He is widely considered to be &quot;Iran&#x27;s first reformer&quot;, a moderniser who was &quot;unjustly struck down&quot; as he attempted to bring &quot;gradual reform&quot; to Iran. Amir Kabir founded the first centre for higher education in Iran and the second Persian-language newspaper in the country. He prohibited bribery, torture of defendants and prisoners, and structured Iranian tax and financial system. As the prime minister, he also ordered suppression of Babism and the execution of the founder of the movement, the Báb. In the last years of his life he was exiled to Fin Garden in Kashan and was murdered by the command of Naser al-Din Shah on 10 January 1852.

==Background and achievements==
===Early career===

Amir Kabir was born in Hazaveh in the Arak district, in what is now Markazi Province of Iran. His father, Karbalaʾi Mohammad Qorban, entered the service of Mirza Bozorg Qa&#x27;em-Maqam of Farahan as cook, and when Mirza Bozorg was appointed chief minister to ʿAbbas Mirza, the crown prince, in Tabriz, Karbalaʾi Qorban accompanied him there, taking his son with him. Amir Kabir first assisted his father in performing domestic duties in the household of Mirza Bozorg, who saw signs of unusual talent in the boy and had him study with his own children. Mirza Bozorg died in 1237/1822 and was succeeded in the post of minister to the crown prince by his son, Mirza Bozorg. Under the son&#x27;s aegis, Amir Kabir entered government service, being appointed first to the post of &quot;lashkarnevis&quot; [military registrar] for the army of Azerbaijan. In 1251/1835, he was promoted to the position of &quot;mostofi-ye nezam&quot;, becoming responsible for supervising the finances of the army of Azerbaijan; several years later he was put in charge of the same army’s provisions, financing, and organization with the title of &quot;vazir-e nezam&quot;.

During his tenure, Amir Kabir participated in many missions abroad. He spent almost four years in Erzurum, part of a commission to delineate the Ottoman-Iranian frontier. He resisted attempts to exclude Mohammareh (present-day Khorramshahr) from Iranian sovereignty and to make Iran pay compensation for its military incursions into the area of Solaymaniyeh. In this, he acted independently of the central government in Tehran, which not only failed to formulate a consistent policy vis-à-vis the Ottomans but also opposed most of Amir Kabir’s initiatives. Although a form of treaty was concluded between Iran and the Ottoman state, the borders had still not been delineated when the Crimean War erupted and the British and Russian mediators, now at war with one another, withdrew. Amir Kabir nonetheless acquired first-hand knowledge of the procedures of international diplomacy and of the aims and policies of Britain and Russia with respect to Iran. This helped him in the elaboration of his own distinct policies toward the two powers when he became chief minister.

Moreover, his years in Erzurum fell during the Ottoman military and administrative reforms known as the Tanzimat. Some awareness of these reached Amir Kabir in Erzurum and inspired in him at least one aspect of his policy as chief minister: the elimination of clerical influence upon affairs of state. When explaining to the British consul at Tabriz in 1265/1849 his own determination to make the authority of the state paramount, he said, “The Ottoman government was able to begin reviving its power only after breaking the power of the mullahs”.

===Reforms of the army===
Amir Kabir returned to Tabriz in 1263/1847. A year later, while retaining the post and title of &quot;vazir-e nezam&quot;, he was appointed lala-bashi or chief tutor to the crown prince Naser-al-din, who was still only fifteen years of age. Soon after, in Shawwal, 1264/September, 1848, Mohammad Shah died, and Naser al-din had to proceed to Tehran and assume the throne. But his minister, Mirza Fathallah Nasir-al-molk ʿAliabadi, was unable to procure the necessary funds, so Naser-al-din had recourse to Amir Kabir, who made the necessary arrangements. Naser-al-din’s confidence in Amir Kabir increased, and shortly after leaving Tabriz, he awarded him the rank of &quot;amir-e nezam&quot;, with full responsibility for the whole Iranian army. After arriving in Tehran, he also appointed him chief minister (shakhs-e avval-e Iran), with the supplementary titles of &quot;amir-e kabir&quot; and &quot;atabak&quot; (Ḏu’l-qaʿda, 1264/October, 1848). The former title came to be his common designation; the latter, used for the first time since the Saljuq period, referred to the tutorial relationship between the minister and his young master.

His appointment as the chief minister aroused resentment, particularly the Queen Mother, Malek Jahan Khanom, and other princes, who resented Amir Kabir’s reduction of their spending and allowances. The intrigues of his opponents resulted in a mutiny of a company of Azerbaijani troops garrisoned in Tehran; but with the cooperation of Mirza Abu’l-Qasem Imam of Friday Prayer in Tehran, who ordered the merchants of Tehran to close the bazaar and arm themselves, the mutiny was soon quelled, and Amir Kabir resumed his duties.

More severe disorder prevailed in a number of provincial cities, especially Mashhad. Toward the end of the reign of Mohammad Shah, Hamza Mirza Heshmat-al-doleh was appointed governor of Khorasan, but he found his authority disputed by Hasan Khan Salar, who, with the help of some local chieftains, had rebelled against the central government (1262/1846). Hamza Mirza abandoned Mashad to Hasan Khan and fled to Herat. Amir Kabir sent two armies against Hasan Khan, the second of which, commanded by Soltan Morad Mirza, defeated his forces and captured him. Amir Kabir had him executed (1266/1850), together with one of his sons and one of his brothers, a punishment of unprecedented severity for such provincial resistance to central authority, and a clear sign of Amir Kabir’s intention to assert the prerogatives of the state.

===Administrative reforms===
With order reestablished in the provinces, Amir Kabir turned to a wide variety of administrative, cultural, and economic reforms that were the major achievement of his brief ministry. His most immediate success was the vaccination of Iranians against smallpox, saving the lives of many thousands if not millions. Faced with an empty treasury on his arrival in Tehran, he first set about balancing the state budget by attempting to increase the sources of revenue and to decrease state expenditure. To aid him in the task, he set up a budgetary committee headed by Mirza Yusof Mostofi-al-mamalek that estimated the deficiency in the budget at one million Iranian toman. Amir Kabir thereupon decided to reduce drastically the salaries of the civil service, often by half, and to eliminate a large number of stipends paid to pensioners who did little or no governmental work. This measure increased his unpopularity with many influential figures and thus contributed to his ultimate disgrace and death.

At the same time he strove to collect overdue taxes from provincial governors and tribal chieftains by dispatching assessors and collectors to every province of the country. The collection of customs duties, previously farmed out to individuals, was now made the direct responsibility of the central government, and the Caspian fisheries, an important source of revenue, were recovered from a Russian monopoly and contracted out to Iranians.

The administration of the royal lands (&quot;khalesajat&quot;) came under review, and the income derived from them was more closely supervised than before. Yield and productivity, not area, were established as the basis of tax assessment for other lands, and previously dead lands were brought under cultivation. These various measures for the encouragement of agriculture and industry also benefited the treasury by raising the level of national prosperity and hence taxability.

Of particular interest is the care shown by Amir Kabir for the economic development of Khuzestan (then known as ʿArabestan), identified by him as an area of strategic importance, given its location at the head of the Persian Gulf, and also of potential prosperity. He introduced the planting of sugarcane to the province, built the Naseri dam on the river Karkheh and a bridge at Shushtar, and laid plans for the development of Mohammara. He also took steps to promote the planting of American cotton near Tehran and Urmia.

===Dar al-Fanun and cultural achievements===

Among the various measures enacted by Amir Kabir, the foundation of the Darolfonun, in Tehran was possibly the most lasting in its effects. Decades later, many parts of this establishment were turned into the University of Tehran, with the remaining becoming Darolfonun Secondary School. The initial purpose of the institution was to train officers and civil servants to pursue the regeneration of the state that Amir Kabir had begun, but as the first educational institution giving instruction in modern learning, it had far wider impact. Among the subjects taught were medicine, surgery, pharmacology, natural history, mathematics, geology, and natural science. The instructors were for the most part Austrians, recruited in Vienna by Daʾud Khan, an Assyrian who had become acquainted with Amir Kabir during the work of the Ottoman–Iranian border commission. By the time the instructors arrived in Tehran in Moharram, 1268/November, 1851, Amir Kabir had already been dismissed, and it fell to Daʾud Khan to receive them. The Austrian instructors initially knew no Persian, so interpreters had to be employed to assist in the teaching; but some among them soon learned Persian well enough to compose textbooks in the language on various natural sciences. These were to influence the evolution of a more simple and effective prose style in Persian than had previously existed. Dar ul-Funun had large fluctuations in its enrollment, primarily due to the Shah&#x27;s fluctuating commitment in funding put into the institution. A clear decline in investment was apparent when a visitor reported in 1870 that seventy students and only a single European instructor were enrolled at the institution. Mirza Aqa Khan Nuri, Amir Kabir&#x27;s successor, sought to persuade Naser-al-din Shah to abrogate the whole project, but the Darolfonun, soon became a posthumous monument to its founder.

Amir Kabir made a second indirect contribution to the elaboration of Persian as a modern medium with his foundation of the newspaper &quot;Vaqayeʿ-ye Ettefaqiyeh&quot;, which survived under different titles until the reign of Mozaffar-al-din Shah. A minimum circulation was ensured by requiring every official earning more than 2,000 rials a year to subscribe. In founding the journal Amir Kabir hoped to give greater effect to government decrees by bringing them to the attention of the public; thus the text of the decree forbidding the levying of &quot;soyursat&quot; was published in the third tissue of the paper. He also wished to educate its readers in the world’s political and scientific developments; among the items reported in the first year of publication were the struggles of Mazzini against the Habsburg Empire, the drawing up of the Suez Canal project, the invention of the balloon, a census of England, and the doings of cannibals in Borneo.

All of the measures enumerated so far had as their purpose the creation of a well-ordered and prosperous country, with undisputed authority exercised by the central government. This purpose was in part frustrated by the Ulema, who throughout the Qajar period disputed the legitimacy of the state and often sought to exercise an independent and rival authority. Amir Kabir took a variety of steps designed to curb their influence, above all in the sphere of law. He sought initially to supersede the sharʿ courts in the capital by sitting in judgment himself on cases brought before him; he abandoned the attempt when he realized that the inadequacy of his juridical knowledge had caused him to pronounce incorrect verdicts. Then he established indirect control over the sharʿ courts by giving prominence to one of them that enjoyed his special favor and by assigning the divan-khana, the highest instance of ʿorf jurisdiction, a more prominent role. All cases were to be referred to it before being passed on to a sharʿ court of the state’s choosing, and any verdict the sharʿ court then reached was valid only if endorsed by the &quot;divan-khaneh&quot;. In addition, any case involving a member of the non- Muslim minorities belonged exclusively to the jurisdiction of the divan-khana. Not content with thus circumscribing the prerogatives of the sharʿ courts, Amir Kabir took stringent measures against sharʿ judges found guilty of bribery or dishonesty; thus Molla ʿAbd-al-Rahim Borujerdi was expelled from Tehran when he offered to settle a case involving one of Amir Kabir&#x27;s servants to the liking of the minister.

Amir Kabir also sought to reduce clerical power by restricting the ability of the ulema to grant refuge (bast), in their residences and mosques. In 1266/1850, bast was abolished, for example, at the Masjed-e Shah in Tehran, although it was restored after the downfall of Amir Kabir. In Tabriz, prolonged efforts were made to preserve bast at various mosques in the city, and recourse was even had to the alleged miracle of a cow that twice escaped the slaughterhouse by running into the shrine known as Boqʿa-ye Saheb-al-amr. The immediate instigators of the &quot;miracle&quot; were brought to Tehran, and soon after the &quot;emam-e jomʿa&quot; and &quot;shaykh-al-eslam&quot; of Tabriz, who had reduced civil government in the city to virtual impotence, were expelled. Less capable of fulfillment was Amir Kabir&#x27;s desire to prohibit the taziyeh, the Shia &quot;passion play&quot; enacted in Moharram, as well as the public self-flagellation that took place during the mourning season. He obtained the support of several ulema in his attempt to prohibit these rites, but was obliged to relent in the face of strong opposition, particularly from Isfahan and Azerbaijan.

===Minorities===
Amir Kabir took a largely benevolent interest in the non-Muslim minorities of Iran, though in order to further his desire of strengthening the state. In Erzurum he had learned how European powers intervened in Ottoman affairs on the pretext of &quot;protecting&quot; the Christian minorities, and there were indications that Britain, Russia, and France hoped for similar benefits from the Assyrians and Armenians of Iran. He moved therefore to remove any possible grievances and hence any need for a foreign &quot;protector.&quot; He exempted the priests of all denominations from taxation, and gave material support to Christian schools in Azerbaijan and Isfahan. In addition, he established a close relationship with the Zoroastrians of Yazd, and gave strict orders to the governor of the city that they not be molested or subjected to arbitrary taxes. He also forbade attempts made in Shushtar to convert forcibly the Mandaean community to Islam.

===Foreign policy===
The foreign policy of Amir Kabir was as innovative as his internal policies. He has been credited with pioneering the policy of &quot;negative equilibrium,&quot; (giving concessions to neither Britain nor Russia) that was to later prove influential in Iranian foreign affairs. He thus abrogated the agreement whereby the Russians were to operate a trade center and hospital in Astarabad, and attempted to put an end to the Russian occupation of Ashuradeh, an island in the southeastern corner of the Caspian Sea, as well as the anchorage rights enjoyed by Russian ships in the lagoon of Anzali.

In the south of Iran he made similar efforts to restrict British influence in the Persian Gulf, and denied Britain the right to stop Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf on the pretext of looking for slaves. It is not surprising that he frequently clashed with Dolgorukiy and Sheil, the representatives of Russia and Britain in Tehran. In order to counteract British and Russian influence, he sought to establish relations with powers without direct interests in Iran, notably Austria and the United States. It may finally be noted that he set up a counter-espionage organization that had agents in the Russian and British embassies.
==Suppression of Bábís and execution of the Báb==
Amir Kabir regarded the followers of Bábism, the predecessor of the Baháʼí Faith, as a threat and repressed them. He suppressed the Babi upheavals of 1848-51 and personally ordered the execution of the Seven Martyrs of Tehran and the execution of The Báb, the movement&#x27;s founder. `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá referred to Amir Kabir as the greatest of the religion&#x27;s oppressors but also acknowledged his significant government reforms.

The challenging and heterodox nature of the Báb&#x27;s claims provoked opposition on the part of the Shiʿite establishment, which then led the civil authorities of Qajar Iran to intervene on the side of the clerics. Although no Bábis are known to have been put to death for their faith during the first three-and-a-half years of the movement and during the reign of Mohammad Shah (May 1844-late 1847), several leading Bábi were persecuted for their activities; e.g. Mullá ʻAlíy-i-Bastámí, one of the early disciples of the Bab was arrested and put on trial in Ottoman Iraq in January 1845, and condemned to work in the naval dockyards in Istanbul where he soon died.

In 1848, however, after the death of Mohammad Shah, and enthronement of the new teenage king, Naser al-Din Shah and premiership of Amir Kabir, circumstances changed and a number of confrontations occurred between the Bábís and government and clerical establishment which lead to the massacre of several thousand Bábís. 

The first major killings of Bábís recorded in history took place in Qazvin. Since then, attacks against the Bábís by prominent clerics and their followers became more common and some Bábís started to carry arms. In remote and isolated places the scattered Bábís were readily attacked and killed while in places where large numbers of them resided they acted in self-defense. One of these attacks occurred in Babol of Mazandaran, where a group of Bábís under the leadership of Mullá Husayn Bushrui were passing through. A mob led by a local cleric attacked them and a fighting broke out between the two groups. The Bábís took refuge in the nearby shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi. Accused of rebellion by their opponents, they were subsequently attacked by various local and national forces. After seven months of siege and severely weakened by starvation and their own loss of men, they responded to sworn promises of a truce and were for the most part massacred. After that, two other big clashes between the Bábís and their opponents took place in the cities of Zanjan and Neyriz in the north and south of Iran, respectively, as well as a smaller conflict in Yazd. A total of several thousand Bábís were killed in these conflicts. In the three main conflicts in Ṭabarsí, Zanjan and Neyriz, Bábís were accused by their enemies of revolting against the government. However, in all three cases, the battles that took place were of a defensive nature, and not considered an offensive jihad, as the Báb did not allow it and in the case of two urban conflicts (Neyriz and Zanjan), they were related to pre-existing social and political tensions within the towns. 

After the Ṭabarsi conflict, mere adherence to the Báb could be sufficient to lead to a death sentence. One famous example of that is when Amir Kabir personally ordered the public beheading of seven prominent Babis of high social rank, (three merchants, two clerics, a leading dervish and a government official) in February 1850 . The seven could easily have saved their lives by recanting their faith, but they refused.

In mid-1850, Amir Kabir ordered the execution of the Báb which was followed by the killings of many other Bábís. The Báb stood his ground despite great pressure to recant, and gain his freedom. Consequently he was executed by a firing squad in public in Tabriz, the first exection of its kind in Iran, to crush the Babi movement and to display the restored power of the Qajar government under the new minister, Amir Kabir.

The confrontation between Amir Kabir and the Bábís was between two visions of modernity. Amir Kabir envisaged state-enforced reforms that were authoritarian and secular while the Bábís advocated an all-embracing religious renewal, proposed by the Báb that emphasized, among other teachings, on progressive revelation, abolishing priesthood, independent investigation of religious matters without the need for the clergy, and improving the status of women. 

The Babis were advocating a grass-roots revolution to reform religious doctrine and remedy the ills of the clerical class and those of the community as a whole. Amir Kabir, on the other, sought to eliminate all expressions of religious dissent while trying unsuccessfully to subordinate the clerical class to the authority of the state. The European-inspired secularism of Amir Kabir was antithetical to serious reconsideration of religious tenets; especially if they could disturb security and order. By denying the Babis a chance to survive as a viable alternative, the Qajar state reaffirmed the unrivaled status of the clergy as the sole arbiter of religious norms. With the suppression of the Bábi movement chances for an indigenous movement of change ceased to exist for decades to come, and Amir Kabir inadvertently cleared the way for the consolidation of the power of the clergy for the rest of the century and beyond.

==Dismissal and execution==

From the start, Amir Kabir&#x27;s policies incited animosity within the influential circles of Iranian elite – most notably the inner circle of the monarchy whose pensions and income were slashed by his financial reforms. He was also later opposed by those who envied him his numerous posts; they were backed strongly by foreign powers, whose influence had greatly diminished under his leadership. A coalition was thus formed among this opposition whose prominent members consisted of the Queen Mother, Mirza Aqa Khan-e Nuri (Amir Kabir’s lieutenant, reputedly Anglophile), and Mirza Yusuf Khan Ashtiyani (the Court&#x27;s chief accountant, reputedly Russophile).

As the adolescent Nasir al-Din Shah began to exert his own independence in government, he was strongly influenced by the Queen Mother. Through her influence, Amir Kabir was demoted solely to the chief of the army and replaced by Nuri as the premier. This transition marked a rejection &quot;of … reformist measures in favor of the traditional practices of government.&quot; The power struggle in government finally resulted in his arrest and expulsion from the capital under continued Russian and British interference. Amir Kabir was sent to Kashan under duress and kept in isolation by the Shah&#x27;s decree. His execution was ordered six weeks later after the Queen Mother and his executioner, Ali Khan Farash-bashi, had convinced the King that Amir Kabir would soon be granted protection by the Russians – possibly allowing him to make an attempt to regain control of the government by force. The young Shah may have been inclined to believe these accusations because of the arrogance and disdain for protocol that Amir Kabir had shown since the beginning of his government career in Tabriz. Amir Kabir was murdered in Kashan on 10 January 1852. With him, many believe, died the prospect of an independent Iran led by meritocracy rather than nepotism.

==Legacy==
Among his Iranian contemporaries Amir Kabir received praise from several poets of the age, notably Sorush and Qaʾani, but his services to Iran remained generally unappreciated in the Qajar period. Modern Iranian historiography has done him more justice, depicting him as one of the few capable and honest statesmen to emerge during the Qajar era and the progenitor of various political and social changes that came about half a century later:

* Amir Kabir Dam, inaugurated in 1961, is named after him.
* Tehran Polytechnic, established in 1958, was renamed Amirkabir University of Technology after him in 1979.
* Amirkabir, a well-known publisher founded in 1949.

==Fictional portrayal==
* Amir Kabir Farahani is portrayed by actor Dariush Arjmand in Mohsen Makhmalbaf&#x27;s movie &quot;Nasereddin Shah, Actor-e Cinema&quot;.
* He is also portrayed by Saeed Nikpour in the Iranian television series &quot;Amir Kabir&quot;.
* He is also portrayed by Naser Malek Motiee in Iranian television series &quot;Soltan-e Sahebgharan&quot;.

<doc id="420938" wikidata="Q8023632" url="?curid=420938" title="Win Ben Stein's Money">
<text>Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money is an American television game show created by Al Burton and Donnie Brainard that aired first-run episodes from July 28, 1997, to January 31, 2003, on Comedy Central. The show features three contestants who compete to answer general knowledge questions to win the grand prize of $5,000 from the show&#x27;s host, Ben Stein. In the second half of each episode, Stein participates as a &quot;common&quot; contestant in order to defend his money from being taken by his competitors. The show won six Daytime Emmy awards, with Stein and Jimmy Kimmel, the show&#x27;s original co-host, sharing the Outstanding Game Show Host award in 1999. The show was produced by Valleycrest Productions, Ltd. and distributed by Buena Vista Television, both subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company.

As noted in the disclaimer during the closing credits, prize money won by contestants is paid from a prize budget furnished by the producers of the show. Any money left over in that budget at the end of a season is given to Stein. If the total amount paid out during a season exceeds that budget, the production company pays the excess. In this way, Stein is never in any danger of losing money from his own pocket.

Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the series for the first three years. Kimmel left in September 2000 to focus on &quot;The Man Show&quot; and was replaced by &quot;South Park&quot;&#x27;s then head writer Nancy Pimental, who co-hosted the program through March 2002. Kimmel&#x27;s cousin Sal Iacono took over the role in April 2002 and stayed until the series ended in 2003. Kimmel made guest appearances and hosted College Week in 2001 and the final week of shows in March 2002.

==Game format==
===Round 1===
The game begins with three contestants and $5,000 in Stein&#x27;s bank. Five categories are available for contestants to choose from, with pun-laden titles hinting at the questions&#x27; content. After a contestant chooses a category, its value is revealed ($50, $100, or $150) and Stein asks a toss-up question open to all three contestants. Higher-valued categories are more difficult. If a contestant rings in and answers correctly, the question value is added to their score and deducted from Stein&#x27;s bank. An incorrect response carries no penalty but allows the other two contestants a chance to ring in. The contestant who answers the toss-up is then asked a follow-up question worth $50. If they cannot answer correctly, either of the other two can ring in and attempt to score. If no one rings in and answers the toss-up question correctly, the $50 follow-up question is asked as a toss-up as well. Once both questions have been asked, the category is removed from play and a new one substituted in its place, and the contestant who gave the last correct answer to that point chooses the next category.

The co-host warns the contestants when there are two minutes left in the round. Once time runs out, the lowest-scoring contestant is eliminated and their total is returned to Stein&#x27;s bank. If there is a tie for low score, one last toss-up is asked; an incorrect response allows the opponent to advance by default.

As a running gag, Stein often pokes fun at rival quiz show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, given the similarities of formats between both shows. As such, any contestant who accidentally responds in the form of a question is made to wear a dunce cap for the rest of the round.

===Round 2===
Stein replaces the eliminated contestant and turns over question-asking duties to the co-host, who always states that Stein has no advance knowledge of any questions that are used from that point forward. This round is played similarly to the first, with some rule changes. Stein chooses the first category to start the round, and the values are increased to $200–$500, in increments of $100. Each category consists of a single toss-up question, with no follow-up. If Stein answers correctly, his bank total remains unchanged; his podium (which is always on the far right) always displays a dollar sign instead of his total. The co-host announces a one-minute warning before the round ends. When time runs out, the lower-scoring contestant is eliminated, forfeiting all money won, which is returned to Stein&#x27;s bank; in the event of a tie, a toss-up tiebreaker is asked, with Stein not participating. The higher-scoring contestant keeps all money won and advances to the bonus round for a chance to win the entire $5,000.

===Bonus Round: Best of 10 Test of Knowledge===
In the bonus round, the &quot;Best of 10 Test of Knowledge&quot;, both Stein and the winner of the second round are placed in isolation booths so that neither can hear the other&#x27;s answers. The contestant has the choice of playing first or second. The person playing first is given 60 seconds to answer a total of 10 questions and can pass if he or she chooses to do so; however, questions which are passed or answered incorrectly cannot be returned to during the round. After the first person plays the round, the answers to the missed or passed questions are reviewed, and the other is given 60 seconds to answer the same 10 questions.

If the contestant answers more questions correctly than Stein, the contestant wins the entire $5,000 grand prize that Stein put into the bank at the beginning of the show. If Stein answers more questions correctly, the contestant keeps only the money won in the first two rounds. If the round ends in a tie, the contestant wins an additional $1,000; however, in the earliest episodes of the first season, the contestant wins the full $5,000 jackpot in the event of a tie.

The isolation booth for the contestant is plain, with a hardwood stool and a bare hanging light bulb. From season 3 to the end of the series, the contestant&#x27;s booth has a large crack running down the wall. Stein&#x27;s booth is more luxurious, with a leather wing-back chair and other lavish furnishings.

===&quot;Ben Stein&#x27;s Cup&quot; episodes===
Near the end of the fourth season, six of the best contestants who previously won $5,000 return for a special &quot;Ben Stein&#x27;s Cup&quot; episode, for a chance to win $25,000. In the first round, question values were $200, $400, and $600, with follow-up questions worth $200. In the second round, questions are worth $800–$2,000 in increments of $400. In both episodes, the winners attempt to defeat Stein for the entire $25,000. The first &quot;Ben Stein&#x27;s Cup&quot; is co-hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, with the second co-hosted by Nancy Pimental.

==Music==
Various pieces of classical music are used as the themes. The opening theme is the fourth movement of &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony&quot;, &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, which is repeated to begin the second round, and again if the champion wins the $5,000. The closing theme is &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Valkyrie&quot;. Other classical music pieces used on the show include:
* &quot;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach (at the beginning of the show when Stein introduces himself)
* &quot;Water Music&quot; by Georg Friedrich Händel (leading to first commercial break)
* Spring from &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; by Antonio Vivaldi (Coming out of the first commercial break)
* &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (leading into the second commercial break)
* &quot;Trepak (a/k/a &quot;The Russian Dance&quot;)&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (used to segue to the final commercial break)
* &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky (coming out of the final commercial break and cuing to the final round)

<text>Electronic stability control (ESC), also referred to as electronic stability program (ESP) or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle&#x27;s stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help steer the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer, or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle&#x27;s cornering performance; instead, it helps reduce the chance of the driver losing control of the vehicle on a slippery road.

According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2004 and 200, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by the use of this technology. In Europe the electronic stability program has saved an estimated 15,000 lives. ESC has been mandatory in new cars in Canada, the US, and the European Union since 2011, 2012, and 2014, respectively. Worldwide, 82 percent of all new passenger cars feature the anti-skid system.

== History ==

In 1983, a four-wheel electronic &quot;Anti-Skid Control&quot; system was introduced on the Toyota Crown. In 1987, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Toyota introduced their first traction control systems. Traction control works by applying individual wheel braking and throttle to maintain traction under acceleration, but unlike ESC, it is not designed to aid in steering.

In 1990, Mitsubishi released the Diamante in Japan. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle had been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking were automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi&#x27;s TCL system had an active safety function, which improved course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called &quot;trace control&quot;), thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds, although there is no yaw input. The TCL system&#x27;s standard wheel slip control function enabled better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the system&#x27;s individual effect, it also worked together with the Diamante&#x27;s electronically controlled suspension and four-wheel steering to improve total handling and performance.

BMW, working with Bosch and Continental, developed a system to reduce engine torque to prevent loss of control and applied it to most of the BMW model line for 1992, excluding the E30 and E36. This system could be ordered with the winter package, which came with a limited-slip differential, heated seats, and heated mirrors. From 1987 to 1992, Mercedes-Benz and Bosch co-developed a system called &quot;Elektronisches Stabilitätsprogramm&quot; (&quot;Electronic Stability Program&quot;, trademarked as ESP) to control lateral slippage.

=== Introduction, second generation ===
In 1995, three automobile manufacturers introduced ESC systems. Mercedes-Benz, supplied by Bosch, was the first to implement ESP with their Mercedes-Benz S 600 Coupé. Toyota&#x27;s Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system appeared on the Toyota Crown Majesta in 1995.

General Motors worked with Delphi Automotive and introduced its version of ESC, called &quot;StabiliTrak&quot;, in 1996 for the 1997 model year on select Cadillac models. StabiliTrak was made standard equipment on all GM SUVs and vans sold in the U.S. and Canada by 2007, except for certain commercial and fleet vehicles. While the StabiliTrak name is used on most General Motors vehicles for the U.S. market, &quot;Electronic Stability Control&quot; is used for GM&#x27;s overseas brands, such as Opel, Holden and Saab, except in the cases of Saab&#x27;s 9-7X and 9-4X (which also use the StabiliTrak name).

The same year, Cadillac introduced an integrated vehicle handling and software control system called the Integrated Chassis Control System (ICCS), on the Cadillac Eldorado. It involves an omnibus computer integration of engine, traction control, Stabilitrak electronic stability control, steering, and adaptive continuously variable road sensing suspension (CVRSS), with the intent of improving responsiveness to driver input, performance, and overall safety, similar to Toyota/Lexus Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management.

In 1997, Audi introduced the first series production ESP for all-wheel drive vehicles (Audi A8 and Audi A6 with quattro (four-wheel drive system)). In 1998, Volvo Cars began to offer their version of ESC called Dynamic Stability and Traction Control (DSTC) on the new Volvo S80. Meanwhile, others investigated and developed their own systems.

During a moose test, Swedish journalist Robert Collin of &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot; rolled a Mercedes A-Class (without ESC) at 78 km/h in October 1997. Because Mercedes Benz promoted a reputation for safety, they recalled and retrofitted 130,000 A-Class cars with firmer suspension and sportier tyres; all newly produced A- class featured ESC as standard along with the upgraded suspension and wheels. This produced a significant reduction in crashes, and the number of vehicles with ESC rose. The availability of ESC in small cars like the A-Class ignited a market trend; thus, ESC became available for all models (whether standard or as an option).

Ford&#x27;s version of ESC, called AdvanceTrac, was launched in the year 2000. Ford later added Roll Stability Control to AdvanceTrac which was first introduced in the Volvo XC90 in 2003. It has been implemented in many Ford vehicles since.

Ford and Toyota announced that all their North American vehicles would be equipped with ESC standard by the end of 2009 (it was standard on Toyota SUVs as of 2004, and after the 2011 model year, all Lexus, Toyota, and Scion vehicles had ESC; the last one to get it was the 2011 model-year Scion tC). However, as of November 2010, Ford still sold models in North America without ESC. General Motors had made a similar announcement for the end of 2010.

=== Third generation and after ===
In 2003 in Sweden the purchase rate on new cars with ESC was 15%. The Swedish road safety administration issued a strong ESC recommendation and in September 2004, 16 months later, the purchase rate was 58%. A stronger ESC recommendation was then given and in December 2004, the purchase rate on new cars had reached 69% and by 2008 it had grown to 96%. ESC advocates around the world are promoting increased ESC use through legislation and public awareness campaigns and by 2012, most new vehicles should be equipped with ESC. 

=== Legislation ===
In 2009, the European Union decided to make ESC mandatory. Since November 1, 2011, EU type approval is only granted to models equipped with ESC. Since November 1, 2014, ESC has been required on all newly registered cars in the EU.

The NHTSA required all new passenger vehicles sold in the US to be equipped with ESC as of the 2012 model year, and estimated it will prevent 5,300–9,600 annual fatalities. 

== Concept and operation ==

During normal driving, ESC continuously monitors steering and vehicle direction. It compares the driver&#x27;s intended direction (determined by the measured steering wheel angle) to the vehicle&#x27;s actual direction (determined through measured lateral acceleration, vehicle rotation, and individual road wheel speeds).

===Normal operation===
ESC intervenes only when it detects a probable loss of steering control, such as when the vehicle is not going where the driver is steering. This may happen, for example, when skidding during emergency evasive swerves, understeer or oversteer during poorly judged turns on slippery roads, or hydroplaning. During high-performance driving, ESC can intervene when unwanted, because steering input may not always be indicative of the intended direction of travel (such as during controlled drifting). ESC estimates the direction of the skid, and then applies the brakes to individual wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle&#x27;s vertical axis, opposing the skid and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver&#x27;s commanded direction. Additionally, the system may reduce engine power or operate the transmission to slow the vehicle down.

ESC can function on any surface, from dry pavement to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even aware of any imminent loss of control. This has led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their vehicle&#x27;s handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically alert the driver when they intervene, so that the driver is aware that the vehicle&#x27;s handling limits have been reached. Most activate a dashboard indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle&#x27;s corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, even if it is possible to more precisely match it.

All ESC manufacturers emphasize that the system is not a performance enhancement nor a replacement for safe driving practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within the limits of the vehicle&#x27;s handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, during hydroplaning, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may lose contact with the road surface, reducing its effectiveness.

Due to the fact that stability control can be incompatible with high-performance driving, many vehicles have an override control which allows the system to be partially or fully deactivated. In simple systems, a single button may disable all features, while more complicated setups may have a multi-position switch or may never be fully disengaged.

=== Off-road use ===
ESC systems—due to their ability to enhance vehicle stability and braking—often work to improve traction in off-road situations, in addition to their on-road duties. The effectiveness of traction control systems can vary significantly, due to the significant number of external and internal factors involved at any given time, as well as the programming and testing performed by the manufacturer.

At a rudimentary level, off-road traction varies from typical operational characteristics of on-road traction, depending on the terrain encountered. In an open differential setup, power transfer takes the path of least resistance. In slippery conditions, this means when one wheel loses traction, power will counter-productively be fed to that axle instead of the one with higher grip. ESCs focus on braking wheels that are spinning at a rate drastically different from the opposing axle. While on-road application often supplements rapidly intermittent wheel braking with a reduction of power in loss-of-traction situations, off-road use will typically require consistent (or even increased) power delivery to retain vehicle momentum while the vehicle&#x27;s braking system applies intermittent braking force over a longer duration to the slipping wheel until excessive wheel-spin is no longer detected.

In intermediate level ESC systems, ABS will be disabled, or the computer will actively lock the wheels when brakes are applied. In these systems, or in vehicles without ABS, the performance in emergency braking in slippery conditions is greatly improved as grip state can change extremely rapidly and unpredictably off-road when coupled with inertia. When the brakes are applied and wheels are locked, the tyres do not have to contend with the wheel rolling (providing no braking force) and braking repeatedly. Grip provided by the tyres is constant and as such can make full use of traction wherever it is available. This effect is enhanced where more aggressive tread patterns are present as the large tread lugs dig into the imperfections on the surface or below the substrate, as well as dragging dirt in front of the tyre to increase the rolling resistance even further.

Many newer vehicles designed for off-road duties from the factory, are equipped with Hill Descent Control systems to minimise the risk of such runaway events occurring with novice drivers and provide a more consistent and safe descent than either no ABS, or on-road orientated ABS. These systems aim to keep a fixed speed (or user selected speed) while descending, applying strategic braking or acceleration at the correct moments to ensure wheels all rotate at the same rate while applying full locking braking when required.

In some vehicles, ESC systems automatically detect whether to operate in off- or on-road mode, depending on the engagement of the 4WD system. Mitsubishi&#x27;s unique Super-Select 4WD system (found in Pajero, Triton and Pajero Sport models), operates in on-road mode in 2WD as well as 4WD High-range with the centre differential unlocked. However, it automatically activates off-road traction control and disables ABS braking when shifted into 4WD High-range with centre differential locked, or 4WD Low-range with centre differential locked. Most modern vehicles with fully electronically controlled 4WD systems such as various Land Rovers and Range Rovers, also automatically switch to an off-road-orientated mode of stability and traction control once low range, or certain terrain modes are manually selected.

== Effectiveness ==
Numerous studies around the world have confirmed that ESC is highly effective in helping the driver maintain control of the car, thereby saving lives and reducing the probability of occurrence and severity of crashes. In the fall of 2004, the American National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed international studies, releasing results of a field study of ESC effectiveness in the USA. The NHTSA concluded that ESC reduces crashes by 35%. Additionally, SUVs with stability control are involved in 67% fewer accidents than SUVs without the system. The United States Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) issued its own study in June 2006 showing that up to 10,000 fatal US crashes could be avoided annually if all vehicles were equipped with ESC. The IIHS study concluded that ESC reduces the likelihood of all fatal crashes by 43%, fatal single-vehicle crashes by 56%, and fatal single-vehicle rollovers by 77–80%.

ESC is described as the most important advance in auto safety by many experts, including Nicole Nason, administrator of the NHTSA, Jim Guest and David Champion of Consumers Union of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), E-Safety Aware, Csaba Csere, former editor of Car and Driver, and Jim Gill, long time ESC proponent of Continental Automotive Systems.

The European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) &quot;strongly recommends&quot; that people buy cars fitted with stability control. The IIHS requires that a vehicle must have ESC as an available option in order for it to qualify for their &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award for occupant protection and accident avoidance.

== Components and design ==
ESC incorporates yaw rate control into the anti-lock braking system (ABS). Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to slow down individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a traction control system (TCS or ASR), which senses drive-wheel slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or traction control.

The ESC system uses several sensors to determine where the driver intends to travel. Other sensors indicate the actual state of the vehicle. The control algorithm compares driver input to vehicle response and decides, when necessary, to apply brakes and/or reduce throttle by the amounts calculated through the state space (set of equations used to model the dynamics of the vehicle). The ESC controller can also receive data from and issue commands to other controllers on the vehicle such as an all-wheel drive system or an active suspension system to improve vehicle stability and controllability.

The sensors in an ESC system have to send data at all times in order to detect a loss of traction as soon as possible. They have to be resistant to possible forms of interference, such as precipitation or potholes. The most important sensors are as follows:
*A steering wheel angle sensor that determines where the driver wants to steer. This kind of sensor often uses AMR elements.
*A yaw rate sensor that measures the rotation rate of the car. The data from the yaw sensor is compared with the data from the steering wheel angle sensor to determine regulating action.
*A lateral acceleration sensor that measures the vehicle&#x27;s lateral acceleration. This is often called an accelerometer.
*Wheel speed sensors that measure wheel speed.

Other sensors can include:
*A longitudinal acceleration sensor that is similar to the lateral acceleration sensor in design, but provides additional information about road pitch, as well as being another sensor for vehicle acceleration and speed.
*A roll rate sensor that is similar to the yaw rate sensor in design, but improves the fidelity of the controller&#x27;s vehicle model and provides more accurate data in combination with the other sensors.

ESC uses a hydraulic modulator to assure that each wheel receives the correct brake force. A similar modulator is used in ABS. Whereas ABS reduces hydraulic pressure during braking, ESC may increase pressure in certain situations, and an active vacuum brake booster unit may be utilised in addition to the hydraulic pump to meet these demanding pressure gradients.

At the centre of the ESC system is the electronic control unit (ECU), which contains various control techniques. Often, the same ECU is used for different systems at the same time (such as ABS, traction control, or climate control). The input signals are sent through an input circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient, and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the vehicle&#x27;s actual yaw rate. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs the valves of the hydraulic modulator. The ECU is connected with other systems via a Controller Area Network interface in order to avoid conflicting with them.

Many ESC systems have an override switch so the driver can disable ESC, which may be used on loose surfaces such as mud or sand, or if using a small spare tire, which could interfere with the sensors. Some systems also offer an additional mode with raised thresholds, so that a driver can utilize the limits of their vehicle&#x27;s grip with less electronic intervention. However, the ESC reactivates when the ignition is restarted. Some ESC systems that lack an off switch, such as on many recent Toyota and Lexus vehicles, can be temporarily disabled through an undocumented series of brake pedal and handbrake operations. Furthermore, unplugging a wheel speed sensor is another method of disabling most ESC systems. The ESC implementation on newer Ford vehicles cannot be completely disabled, even through the use of the &quot;off switch&quot;. The ESC will automatically reactivate at highway speeds, and below such speeds if it detects a skid with the brake pedal depressed.

== Regulation ==
===Public awareness and law===
While Sweden used public awareness campaigns to promote ESC use, others implemented or proposed legislation.

The Canadian province of Quebec was the first jurisdiction to implement an ESC law, making it compulsory for carriers of dangerous goods (without data recorders) in 2005.

The United States followed, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration implementing FMVSS 126, which requires ESC for all passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4536 kg). The regulation phased in starting with 55% of 2009 models (effective 1 September 2008), 75% of 2010 models, 95% of 2011 models, and all 2012 and later models. The standard endorses the use of the Sine with Dwell test. In 2015 NHTSA finalized updated regulations requiring ESC for truck tractors and certain buses.

Canada required all new passenger vehicles to have ESC from 1 September 2011.

The Australian government announced on 23 June 2009 that ESC would be compulsory from 1 November 2011 for all new passenger vehicles sold in Australia, and for all new vehicles from November 2013, however the State Government of Victoria preceded this unilaterally on Jan 1 2011, much as they had done seatbelts 40 years before. The New Zealand government followed suit in February 2014 making it compulsory on all new vehicles from 1 July 2015 with a staggered roll-out to all used-import passenger vehicles by 1 January 2020.

The European Parliament has also called for the accelerated introduction of ESC. The European Commission has confirmed a proposal for the mandatory introduction of ESC on all new cars and commercial vehicle models sold in the EU from 2012, with all new cars being equipped by 2014.

Argentina requires all new normal cars to have ESC since 1 January 2022, for all new normal vehicles from January 2024.

Chile requires all new cars to have ESC from August 2022.

Brazil has required all new cars to have ESC from 1 January 2024.

=== International vehicle regulations ===

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has passed a Global Technical Regulation to harmonize ESC standards. Global Technical Regulation No. 8 ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEMS was sponsored by the United States of America, and is based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard FMVSS 126.

In Unece countries, approval is based on UN Regulation 140: Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Systems.

== Availability and cost ==
===Cost===
ESC is built on top of an anti-lock brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, federal regulations have required that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to NHTSA research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as US$250. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and may pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.

===Availability===
Availability of ESC in passenger vehicles has varied between manufacturers and countries. In 2007, ESC was available in roughly 50% of new North American models compared to about 75% in Sweden. However, consumer awareness affects buying patterns, so that roughly 45% of vehicles sold in North America and the UK were purchased with ESC, contrasting with 78–96% in other European countries such as Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. While few vehicles had ESC prior to 2004, increased awareness has increased the number of vehicles with ESC on the used car market.

ESC is available on cars, SUVs and pickup trucks from all major automakers. Luxury cars, sports cars, SUVs, and crossovers are usually equipped with ESC. Midsize cars have also been gradually catching on, though the 2008 model years of the Nissan Altima and Ford Fusion only offered ESC on their V6 engine-equipped cars; however, some midsize cars, such as the Honda Accord, had it as standard by then. While traction control is usually included with ESC, there were vehicles such as the 2008 Chevrolet Malibu LS, 2008 Mazda6, and 2007 Lincoln MKZ that had traction control but not ESC. ESC was rare among subcompact cars in 2008. The 2009 Toyota Corolla in the United States (but not Canada) had stability control as a $250 option on all trims below that of the XRS, which had it as standard. In Canada, for the 2010 Mazda3, ESC was an option on the midrange GS trim as part of its sunroof package, and is standard on the top-of-the-line GT version. The 2009 Ford Focus had ESC as an option for the S and SE models, and it was standard on the SEL and SES models

In the UK, even mass-market superminis such as the Ford Fiesta Mk.6 and VW Polo Mk.5 came with ESC as standard.

Elaborate ESC and ESP systems (including Roll Stability Control) are available for many commercial vehicles, including transport trucks, trailers, and buses from manufacturers such as Daimler, Scania, and Prevost. In heavy trucks the ESC and ESP functions must be realized as part of the pneumatic brake system. Typical component and system suppliers are e.g. Bendix, and WABCO.

ESC is also available on some motor homes.

The &quot;ChooseESC!&quot; campaign, run by the EU&#x27;s &quot;eSafetyAware!&quot; project, provides a global perspective on ESC. One &quot;ChooseESC!&quot; publication shows the availability of ESC in EU member countries.

In the US, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website shows availability of ESC in individual US models and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website lists US models with ESC.

In Australia, the NRMA shows the availability of ESC in Australian models.

== Future ==

Just as ESC is founded on the anti-lock braking system (ABS), ESC is the foundation for new advances such as Roll Stability Control or active rollover protection that works in the vertical plane much like ESC works in the horizontal plane. When RSC detects impending rollover (usually on transport trucks or SUVs), RSC applies brakes, reduces throttle, induces understeer, and/or slows down the vehicle.

The computing power of ESC facilitates the networking of active and passive safety systems, addressing other causes of crashes. For example, sensors may detect when a vehicle is following too closely and slow down the vehicle, straighten up seat backs, and tighten seat belts, avoiding and/or preparing for a crash.

Moreover, current research on electronic stability control focuses on the integration of information: i) from systems from multiple domains within the same vehicle, for example radars, cameras, lidars and navigation system; and ii) from other vehicles, road users and infrastructure. Consistently with the trend towards the implementation of forms of model-based and predictive control, such ongoing progress is likely to bring a new generation of vehicle stability controllers in the next few years, capable of pre-emptive interventions, e.g., as a function of the expected path and road curvature ahead.

<text>The vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis, lit. &#x27;vampire squid from hell&#x27;) is a small cephalopod found throughout temperate and tropical oceans in extreme deep sea conditions. The vampire squid uses its bioluminescent organs and its unique oxygen metabolism to thrive in the parts of the ocean with the lowest concentrations of oxygen. It has two long retractile filaments, located between the first two pairs of arms on its dorsal side, which distinguish it from both octopuses and squids, and places it in its own order, Vampyromorphida, although its closest relatives are octopods. As a phylogenetic relict, it is the only known surviving member of its order.

The first specimens were collected on the Valdivia Expedition and were originally described as an octopus in 1903 by German teuthologist Carl Chun, but later assigned to a new order together with several extinct taxa.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot; comes from &quot;vampyro&quot;, meaning vampire, and the Ancient Greek word &#x27;τευθῐ́ς&#x27; (teuthis), meaning &quot;squid&quot;. The species name &quot;infernalis&quot; means &quot;of hell&quot; in Latin.

==Discovery==
The vampire squid was discovered during the Valdivia Expedition (1898–1899), led by Carl Chun. Chun was a zoologist who was inspired by the Challenger Expedition, and wanted to verify that life does indeed exist below 300 fathoms (550 meters). Chun later classified the vampire squid into its family, Vampyroteuthidae. This expedition was funded by the German society &quot;Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte&quot;, a group of German scientists who believed there was life at depths greater than 550 meters, contrary to the Abyssus theory. was fitted with equipment for the collection of deep-sea organisms, as well as laboratories and specimen jars, in order to analyze and preserve what was caught. The voyage began in Hamburg, Germany, followed by Edinburgh, and then traced around the west coast of Africa. After navigating around the southern point of Africa, the expedition studied deep areas of the Indian and Antarctic Ocean. Researchers had not before discovered any species from this family that could be traced back to the Cenozoic. This suggests two ideas which are: a notable preservation bias called the Lazarus effect may exist; or an inaccurate determination of when vampire squids originally settled in the deep oceans. The Lazarus effect may result from the scarcity of post-Cretaceous research regions or from the reduced abundance and distribution of vampire squids. In any case, even while the search regions remain the same, it is more difficult to locate and analyze them.

==Description==
The vampire squid can reach a maximum total length around . Its gelatinous body varies in colour from velvety jet-black to pale reddish, depending on location and lighting conditions. A webbing of skin connects its eight arms, each lined with rows of fleshy spines or cirri; the inner side of this &quot;cloak&quot; is black. Only the distal halves (farthest from the body) of the arms have suckers. The name of the animal was inspired by its dark colour and cloaklike webbing, rather than its habits — it feeds on detritus, not blood.

Its , globular eyes, which appear red or blue, depending on lighting, are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom, with a squid possessing eyes in diameter. Their large eyes are accompanied by the similarly expanded optic lobes of their brain.

Mature adults have a pair of small fins projecting from the lateral sides of the mantle. These earlike fins serve as the adult&#x27;s primary means of propulsion: vampire squid move through the water by flapping their fins. Their beaklike jaws are white. Within the webbing are two pouches wherein the tactile velar filaments are concealed. The filaments are analogous to a true squid&#x27;s tentacles, extending well past the arms; but differ in origin, and represent the pair that was lost by the ancestral octopus.

The vampire squid is almost entirely covered in light-producing organs called photophores, capable of producing disorienting flashes of light ranging in duration from fractions of a second to several minutes. The intensity and size of the photophores can also be modulated. Appearing as small, white discs, the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins, but are absent from the undersides of the caped arms. Two larger, white areas on top of the head were initially believed to also be photophores, but are now identified as photoreceptors.

The chromatophores (pigment organs) common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in the vampire squid. The animal is, therefore, incapable of changing its skin colour in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods, as such an ability would not be useful at the lightless depths where it lives.

===Systematics===
The Vampyromorphida is the extant sister taxon to all octopuses. Phylogenetic studies of cephalopods using multiple genes and mitochondrial genomes have shown that the Vampyromorphida are the first group of Octopodiformes to evolutionarily diverge from all others. The Vampyromorphida is characterized by derived characters such as the possession of photophores and of two velar filaments which are most probably modified arms. It also shares the inclusion of an internal gladius with other coleoids, including squid, and eight webbed arms with cirrate octopods.

&quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot; shares its eight cirrate arms with the Cirrata, in which lateral cirri, or filaments, alternate with the suckers. &quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot; differs in that suckers are present only on the distal half of the arms while cirri run the entire length. In cirrate octopods suckers and cirri run and alternate on the entire length. Also, a close relationship between &quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot; and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Loligosepiina is indicated by the similarity of their gladii, the internal stiffening structure. &quot;Vampyronassa rhodanica&quot; from the middle Jurassic La Voulte-sur-Rhône of France is considered as one of a vampyroteuthid that shares some characters with &quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot;.

The supposed vampyromorphids from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian (156–146 mya) of Solnhofen, &quot;Plesioteuthis prisca&quot;, &quot;Leptotheuthis gigas&quot;, and &quot;Trachyteuthis hastiformis&quot;, cannot be positively assigned to this group; they are large species (from 35 cm in &quot;P. prisca&quot; to &gt; 1 m in &quot;L. gigas&quot;) and show features not found in vampyromorphids, being somewhat similar to the true squids, Teuthida.

==Biology==
The vampire squid&#x27;s worldwide range is confined to the tropics and subtropics. This species is an extreme example of a deep sea cephalopod, thought to reside at aphotic (lightless) depths from or more. Within this region of the world&#x27;s oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Within an OMZ, the saturation of oxygen is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most complex organisms. The vampire squid is the only cephalopod able to live its entire life cycle in the minimum zone, at oxygen saturations as low as 3%.
What behavioral data is known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV). Vampire squid are frequently injured during capture, and can survive up to two months in aquaria. It has been hypothesized that they can live for over eight years.

To cope with life in the suffocating depths, vampire squids have developed several adaptations: Of all deep-sea cephalopods, their mass-specific metabolic rate is the lowest. Their blue blood&#x27;s hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen more efficiently than in other cephalopods, aided by gills possessing an especially large surface area. The animals have weak musculature and a greatly reduced shell, but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort because of sophisticated statocysts (balancing organs akin to a human&#x27;s inner ear) and ammonium-rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater. The vampire squid&#x27;s ability to thrive in OMZs also keeps it safe from apex predators that require a large amount of oxygen to live.

The vampire squid&#x27;s large eyes and optic lobes (of their brain) may be an adaptation for greater sensitivity to distant bioluminescence; signs of animals, such as prey aggregations or potential mates. This sensitivity is useful when monitoring a vast area of the water column, which is largely featureless at these depths.

===Antipredator behavior===
Like many deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid lacks ink sacs. This, along with their low metabolic rate, lead to it adapting various alternate methods of defence. If disturbed, it will curl its arms up outwards and wrap them around its body, turning itself inside-out in a way, making itself seem larger and exposing the spiny projections on its tentacles (the cirri). The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented, concealing most of the body&#x27;s photophores. The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal&#x27;s head, diverting attack away from critical areas. This anti-predator behavior is dubbed the &quot;pumpkin&quot; or &quot;pineapple&quot; posture. The armtips regenerate, so if they are bitten off, they can serve as a diversion allowing the animal to escape while its predator is distracted.

If highly agitated, it may eject a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light from its arm tips. 

This luminous barrage, which may last nearly 10 minutes, would presumably serve to dazzle would-be predators and allow the vampire squid to disappear into the dark without the need to swim far. The glowing &quot;ink&quot; is also able to stick to the predator, creating what is called the &quot;burglar alarm effect&quot; (making the vampire squid&#x27;s would-be predator more visible to secondary predators, similar to the &quot;Atolla&quot; jellyfish&#x27;s light display). The display is made only if the animal is very agitated, due to the metabolic cost of mucus regeneration.

Their aforementioned bioluminescent &quot;fireworks&quot; are combined with the writhing of glowing arms, along with erratic movements and escape trajectories, making it difficult for a predator to identify the squid itself among multiple sudden targets. The vampire squid&#x27;s retractile filaments have been suggested to play a larger role in predator avoidance via both detection and escape mechanisms.

Despite these defence mechanisms, vampire squids have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish, including giant grenadiers, and deep-diving mammals, such as whales and sea lions.

===Feeding===
Vampire squid have eight arms but lack feeding tentacles (like octopods), and instead use two retractile filaments in order to capture food. These filaments have small hairs on them, made up of many sensory cells, that help them detect and secure their prey. They combine waste with mucus secreted from the suckers to form balls of food. As sedentary generalist feeders, they feed on detritus, including the remains of gelatinous zooplankton (such as salps, larvaceans, and medusae jellies) and complete crustaceans, such as copepods, ostracods, amphipods, and isopods, as well as faecal pellets of other aquatic organisms that live above. Vampire squids also use a unique luring method where they purposefully agitate bioluminescent protists in the water as a way to attract larger prey for them to consume.

The mature vampire squid is also thought to be an opportunistic hunter of larger prey as fish bones and scales, along with gelatinous plankton, has been recorded in mature vampire squid stomachs.

===Life cycle===

If hypotheses may be drawn from knowledge of other deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs, or a K-selected strategy. Ovulation is irregular and there is minimal energy devotion into the development of the gonad. Growth is slow, as nutrients are not abundant at depths frequented by the animals. The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make reproductive encounters a fortuitous event. With iteroparity often seen in organisms with high adult survival rates, such as the vampire squid, many low-cost reproductive cycles would be expected for the species.

Reproduction of the vampire squid is unlike any other coleoid cephalopod; the males pass a &quot;packet&quot; of sperm to a female and the female accepts it and stores it in a special pouch inside her mantle. The female may store a male&#x27;s hydraulically implanted spermatophore for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs. Once she does, she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch. Their reproductive strategy appears to be iteroparous, which is an exception amongst the otherwise semelparous Coleoidea. During their life, coleoid cephalopods are thought to go through only one reproductive cycle whereas vampire squid have shown evidence of multiple reproductive cycles. After releasing their eggs, new batches of eggs are formed after the female vampire squid returns to resting. This process may repeat up to, and sometimes more than, twenty times in their lifespan. These spawning events happen quite far apart due to the vampire squid&#x27;s low metabolic rate.

Few specifics are known regarding the ontogeny of the vampire squid. Hatchlings are about 8 mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults, with some differences: they are transparent, their arms lack webbing, their eyes are smaller proportionally, and their velar filaments are not fully formed. Their development progresses through three morphologic forms: the very young animals have a single pair of fins, an intermediate form has two pairs, and the mature form again has one pair of fins. At their earliest and intermediate phases of development, a pair of fins is located near the eyes; as the animal develops, this pair gradually disappears as the other pair develops. As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops, the fins are resized and repositioned to maximize gait efficiency. Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion, mature adults prefer the more efficient means of flapping their fins. This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past, with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families.

The hatchlings survive on a generous internal yolk supply for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed. The younger animals frequent much deeper waters, feeding on marine snow and zooplankton.

==Relationship with humans==
===Conservation status===
The vampire squid is currently not on any endangered or threatened species list and they have no known impact on humans. Vampire squids are at increased risk for micro plastic pollution because their diet is mostly marine snow. Micro plastics can cause death by decreasing feeding activity as they take up space in the digestive tract causing the animal&#x27;s stomach to feel full without providing nutrients.

===Popular culture===

Following an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine by Matt Taibbi after the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, the term &quot;vampire squid&quot; has been regularly used in popular culture to refer to Goldman Sachs, the American investment bank.

Live vampire squids are shown in the &quot;Ocean Deep&quot; episode of &quot;Planet Earth&quot;.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium (California, United States) became the first facility to put this species on display, in May 2014.

Vampire Squids are a species that can be caught and cooked in the 2023 video game &quot;Dave the Diver&quot;.

<text>The Rothko Chapel is a chapel in Houston, Texas, founded by John and Dominique de Menil. The interior serves not only as a chapel, but also as a major work of modern art: on its walls are fourteen paintings by Mark Rothko in varying hues of black. The shape of the building—an octagon inscribed in a Greek cross—and the design of the chapel were largely influenced by the artist. The chapel sits southwest of downtown in the Montrose neighborhood, situated between the building housing the Menil Collection and the Chapel of Saint Basil on the campus of the University of Saint Thomas. About 110,000 people visit the chapel each year.

Susan J. Barnes states &quot;The Rothko Chapel ... became the world&#x27;s first broadly ecumenical center, a holy place open to all religions and belonging to none. It became a center for international cultural, religious, and philosophical exchanges, for colloquia and performances. And it became a place of private prayer for individuals of all faiths&quot;.

On September 16, 2000, the Rothko Chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
In 1964 Rothko was commissioned by John and Dominique de Menil (also founders of the nearby Menil Collection) to create a meditative space filled with his paintings. The works are site-specific, one of the requirements of the program. As Rothko was given creative license on the design of the structure, he clashed with the project&#x27;s original architect, Philip Johnson over the plans for the chapel. The plans went through several revisions and architects. Rothko continued to work first with Howard Barnstone and then with Eugene Aubry, but ultimately he did not live to see the chapel&#x27;s completion in 1971. After a long struggle with depression, Rothko died by suicide in his New York studio on February 25, 1970.

From 1973 onward, the Rothko Chapel doubled as a center for colloquiums aimed at fostering mutual understanding on issues affecting justice and freedom throughout the world. The first colloquium drew scholars from Lebanon, Iran, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Japan, Italy, the United States and Canada. In 1981, it initiated “The Rothko Chapel Awards to Commitment to Truth and Freedom.&quot; In 1986, a second award was established to honor and emulate the spirit of Óscar Romero, Archbishop of San Salvador, who was murdered on March 24, 1980. These Rothko Chapel Awards have recognized individuals and organizations who, at great risk, denounce violations of human rights. In 1991 the Rothko Chapel marked its 20th anniversary with a joint award with the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation, founded in 1986 with former President Jimmy Carter. Nelson Mandela was the keynote speaker and received the special Rothko Chapel award.

In early 1999, the Rothko Chapel closed for a major renovation. The paintings had been exhibiting premature signs of age, and the largest could not be removed for treatment. In 2000, the chapel reopened after an 18-month, $1.8million renovation, with the artist&#x27;s paintings newly restored.

In May 2018, museum staff discovered the Chapel had been vandalized. White paint was spilled near the Chapel&#x27;s entrance and in the reflecting pool surrounding the &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot; sculpture. Handbills had been strewn around the grounds and pool that read &quot;It&#x27;s okay to be white&quot;, an alt-right slogan.

For its fiftieth anniversary in 2021, the Rothko Chapel underwent $30million in restoration to hew nearer the original plan. The 2019-2021 work removed the baffled skylight in favor of a new louvered skylight designed by George Sexton Associates; re-landscaped nearby lawns and fencing; removed glass doors; and added a new visitor&#x27;s center designed by Architecture Research Office.

In July 2024, the Rothko Chapel suffered extensive damage from stormwater during Hurricane Beryl. Three of Rothko&#x27;s murals were damaged, along with the chapel&#x27;s ceiling and walls. The chapel was closed in August 2024 for renovations and restoration. The building reopened in December 2024 after reparative work was completed.

==Architecture==
The chapel is an irregular octagonal brick building with gray or rose stucco walls and a skylight. It serves as a place of meditation as well as a meeting hall and is furnished with eight simple, moveable benches for meditative seating; more are provided to accommodate the audience for special events. Holy books from several religions are available.

As renovated in 2020 by Architecture Research Office and George Sexton Associates, the louvered skylight diffuser consists of 280 reflective aluminum blades that are individually angled and spaced to ensure an even distribution of light onto the paintings along the perimeter walls.

==Works of art==
The chapel is associated with several works of art other than the building itself, in the fields of painting, sculpture, and music.

===Paintings===

Fourteen of Rothko&#x27;s paintings are displayed in the chapel. Three walls display triptychs, while the other five walls display single paintings. Beginning in 1964, Rothko began painting a series of black paintings, which incorporated other dark hues and texture effects.

The de Menils offered Rothko a commission for the chapel in 1964. From the fall of 1964 through the spring of 1967, he painted the fourteen large paintings and four alternates, which incorporated many of the characteristics of the earlier 1964 black paintings.

===Sculpture===

A distinctive sculpture by Barnett Newman, &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot;, was installed in 1970 in front of the chapel. The sculpture sits in a reflecting pool designed by Philip Johnson and it is dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968. The sculpture originally stood in Washington, D.C., and was offered in 1969 by the de Menils as a memorial to King to stand in front of Houston City Hall. Houston turned down the gift and the de Menils then donated the sculpture and the Rothko paintings to start the Rothko Chapel.

===Music===
One of Morton Feldman&#x27;s best known pieces of music was inspired by and written to be performed in the chapel—it too is called &quot;Rothko Chapel&quot; (1971). The musician Peter Gabriel wrote a 1992 song called &quot;Fourteen Black Paintings&quot; which was inspired by a visit to the chapel. David Dondero composed a song entitled &quot;Rothko Chapel&quot; that appears on his 2007 album &quot;Simple Love&quot;. Visiting Tibetan Gyuto Tantric monks performed harmonic chanting in April 1986. Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s HGOco commissioned and premiered an opera in 2017 about the chapel called &quot;Some Light Emerges&quot;, with music by Laura Kaminsky, concept by Mark Campbell and libretto by Campbell and Kimberly Reed.

In 2019, Solange Knowles filmed scenes for the visual album &quot;When I Get Home&quot; in the chapel. Dessa&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Bury the Lede&quot; includes a song called &quot;Rothko&quot;, which is set in the chapel and references the paintings.

==Recognition==

<doc id="420956" wikidata="Q3350835" url="?curid=420956" title="Origins of the Cold War">
<text>The Cold War emerged from the breakdown of relations between two of the primary victors of World War II: the United States and Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc. This ideological and political rivalry, which solidified between 1945-49, would shape the global order for the next four decades.

The roots of the Cold War can be traced back to diplomatic and military tensions preceding World War II. The 1917 Russian Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, where Soviet Russia ceded vast territories to Germany, deepened distrust among the Western Allies. Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War further complicated relations, and although the Soviet Union later allied with Western powers to defeat Nazi Germany, this cooperation was strained by mutual suspicions.

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, disagreements about the future of Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, became central. The Soviet Union&#x27;s establishment of communist regimes in the countries it had liberated from Nazi control—enforced by the presence of the Red Army—alarmed the US and UK. Western leaders saw this as a clear instance of Soviet expansionism, clashing with their vision of a democratic Europe. Economically, the divide was sharpened with the introduction of the Marshall Plan in 1947, a US initiative to provide financial aid to rebuild Europe and prevent the spread of communism by stabilizing capitalist economies. The Soviet Union rejected the Marshall Plan, seeing it as an effort by the US to impose its influence on Europe. In response, the Soviet Union established Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) to foster economic cooperation among communist states.

The first major military confrontation of the Cold War came with the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49, when the Soviets attempted to cut off Western access to Berlin. The US and its allies responded with the Berlin Airlift, supplying West Berlin by air. This marked a turning point, shifting the Cold War from diplomatic tensions to the brink of direct military conflict, further entrenching the division of Europe. By 1949, the Cold War was firmly in place. The creation of NATO in 1949 formalized military alliances within the Western Bloc, signaling the start of a long period of geopolitical confrontation.

==Russian Revolution==
In World War I, Britain, France and Russia, who had formed a Triple Entente, comprised the major Allied Powers from the start. The US joined them as a self-styled Associated Power in March 1917. The Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November 1917 but the Imperial German Army advanced rapidly across the borderlands. The Allies responded with an economic blockade against all of Russia. In early March 1918, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic followed through on the wave of popular disgust against the war and accepted harsh German peace terms with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In the eyes of the Allies, Russia now was helping Germany win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front and by &quot;relinquishing much of Russia&#x27;s food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe&quot;. According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt that &quot;The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention&quot;, and proceeded to step up their economic warfare against the Bolsheviks. Some Bolsheviks saw Russia as only the first step, planning to incite revolutions against capitalism in every western country, but the need for peace with Germany led the first Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin away from this position.

In 1918, Britain sent in money and some troops to support the anti-Bolshevik &quot;White&quot; counter-revolutionaries. This policy was spearheaded by Minister of War Winston Churchill. France, Japan and the United States also sent forces to help decide the Russian Civil War in the Whites’ favor. Lenin made peace overtures to Wilson, and the American leader responded by sending diplomat William Bullitt to Moscow. The Allies ultimately rejected the ceasefire terms which Bullitt negotiated, believing that a White victory was imminent. 

However, the Bolsheviks, operating a unified command from a central location, defeated all the opposition one by one and took full control of Russia, as well as breakaway provinces such as Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Bainbridge Colby, the American Secretary of State, in 1920 announced an American policy of refusing to deal with the new regime. 

Soviet Russia found itself isolated in international diplomacy. Lenin stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a &quot;hostile capitalist encirclement&quot; and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided. Lenin set up the Comintern, which called for revolutionary upheavals in capitalist countries. Nevertheless, Communist revolutions failed in Germany, Bavaria, and Hungary and by the mid-1920s Moscow was no longer fomenting revolution.

==Interwar diplomacy (1918–1939)==
Differences in the political and economic systems of Western democracies and the Soviet Union—dictatorship by one party versus pluralistic competition among parties, mass arrests and execution of dissidents versus free press and independent courts, state ownership of all farms and businesses versus capitalism, became simplified and refined in ideologies to represent two ways of life. 

In 1933, the United States under President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially recognized the Soviet Union. The long delay was caused by Moscow&#x27;s repudiation of Tsarist-era debts, the undemocratic nature of the Soviet government, and its threats to overthrow capitalism using local Communist Parties. By 1933 these issues had faded and the opportunity for greater trade appealed to Washington.

==Start of World War II (1939–1941)==
Moscow was angry with Western appeasement of Adolf Hitler after the signing of the Munich Agreement in 1938 which gave Nazi Germany partial control of Czechoslovakia after conference in which the Soviet Union was not invited.

In 1939, after conducting negotiations with both the British and French group and Germany regarding potential military and political agreements, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a Commercial Agreement providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, commonly named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries (Molotov–Ribbentrop), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.

==Wartime alliance (1941–1945)==

On June 22, 1941, Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union through the territories that the two countries had previously divided. Stalin switched his cooperation from Hitler to Winston Churchill. Britain and the Soviets signed a formal alliance, but the US did not join until after the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Immediately, there was disagreement between Britain&#x27;s ally Poland and the Soviet Union. The British and Poles strongly suspected that when Stalin was cooperating with Hitler, he ordered the execution of about 22,000 Polish officer POWs, at what was later to become known as the Katyn massacre. Still, the Soviets and the Western Allies were forced to cooperate, despite their tensions. The US shipped vast quantities of Lend-Lease material to the Soviets. Britain agreed a broader military and political alliance in 1942.

During the war, both sides disagreed on military strategy, especially the question of the opening of a second front against Germany in Western Europe. As early as July 1941, Stalin asked Britain to invade northern France, but Britain was in no position to carry out such a request. Stalin had also requested that the Western Allies open a second front from the early months of the war—which finally occurred on D-Day, June 6, 1944. The US and Britain initially indicated that they would open the second front in 1942, and then in 1943, but it was postponed both times.

Throughout World War II, the Soviet NKVD&#x27;s mole Kim Philby had access to high-importance British MI6 intelligence, and passed it to the Soviets. He was able to alert the NKVD about all British intelligence on the Soviets—including what the American OSS had shared with the British about the Soviets. 

The Soviets believed at the time, and charged throughout the Cold War, that the Americans intentionally delayed the opening of a second front against Germany in order to intervene only at the last minute so as to influence the peace settlement and dominate Europe. Historians such as John Lewis Gaddis dispute this claim, citing other military and strategic calculations for the timing of the Normandy invasion. In the meantime, the Russians suffered heavy casualties, with as many as twenty million dead. Nevertheless, Soviet perceptions (or misconceptions) of the West and &quot;vice versa&quot; left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.

In turn, in 1944, the Soviets appeared to the Allies to have deliberately delayed the relief of the Polish underground&#x27;s Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi occupation. The Soviets did not supply the Uprising from the air, and for a significant time also refused to allow American air drops. On at least one occasion, a Soviet Air Force fighter shot down a British Royal Air Force plane supplying the Polish insurgents in Warsaw. George Orwell was moved to make a public warning about Soviet postwar intentions. A &#x27;secret war&#x27; also took place between the British SOE-backed AK and Soviet NKVD-backed partisans. British-trained Polish Cichociemni agent Maciej Kalenkiewicz was killed by the Soviets at this time. The British and Soviets sponsored competing factions of resistance fighters in Yugoslavia and Greece, although both ceased after Churchill and Stalin made the Percentages Agreement.

Both sides, moreover, held very dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security. The Americans tended to understand security in situational terms, assuming that, if US-style governments and markets were established as widely as possible, countries could resolve their differences peacefully, through international organizations. The key to the US vision of security was a post-war world shaped according to the principles laid out in the 1941 Atlantic Charter—in other words, a liberal international system based on free trade and open markets. This vision would require a rebuilt capitalist Europe, with a healthy Germany at its center, to serve once more as a hub in global affairs.

This would also require US economic and political leadership of the postwar world. Europe needed the US&#x27;s assistance if it was to rebuild its domestic production and finance its international trade. The US was the only world power not economically devastated by the fighting. By the end of the war, it was producing around fifty percent of the world&#x27;s industrial goods.

Soviet leaders, however, tended to understand security in terms of space. This reasoning was conditioned by Russia&#x27;s historical experiences, given the frequency with which the country had been invaded over the preceding 150 years. The Second World War experience was particularly dramatic for the Russians: the Soviet Union suffered unprecedented devastation as a result of the Nazi onslaught, and over 20 million Soviet citizens died during the war; tens of thousands of Soviet cities, towns, and villages were leveled; and 30,100 Soviet factories were destroyed. In order to prevent a similar assault in the future, Stalin was determined to use the Red Army to gain control of Poland, to dominate the Balkans and to destroy utterly Germany&#x27;s capacity to engage in another war. The problem was that Stalin&#x27;s strategy risked confrontation with the equally powerful United States, who viewed Stalin&#x27;s actions as a flagrant violation of the Yalta agreement.

At the end of the war in Europe, in May 1945, the Soviets insisted on occupying the Danish island of Bornholm, due to its strategic position at the entrance to the Baltic. When the local German commander insisted on surrendering to the Western Allies, as did German forces in the rest of Denmark, the Soviets bombed the island, causing heavy casualties and damage among a civilian population which was only lightly touched throughout the war, and then invaded the island and occupied it until mid-1946—all of which can be considered as initial moves in the Cold War.

Even before the war came to an end, it seemed highly likely that cooperation between the Western powers and the USSR would give way to intense rivalry or conflict. This was due primarily to the starkly contrasting economic ideologies of the two superpowers, now quite easily the strongest in the world. Whereas the US was a liberal, two-party democracy with an advanced capitalist economy, based on free enterprise and profit-making, the USSR was a one-party Marxist–Leninist State with a state-controlled economy where private wealth was all but outlawed. Nevertheless, the origins of the Cold War should also be seen as a historical episode that demarcated the spheres of interests of the United States and the Soviet Union. 

===Wartime conferences===
Several postwar disagreements between western and Soviet leaders were related to their differing interpretations of wartime and immediate post-war conferences.

In late 1943, the Tehran Conference was the first Allied conference in which Stalin was present. At the conference the Soviets expressed frustration that the Western Allies had not yet opened a second front against Germany in Western Europe. In Tehran, the Allies also considered the political status of Iran. At the time, the British had occupied southern Iran, while the Soviets had occupied an area of northern Iran bordering the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, at the end of the war, tensions emerged over the timing of the pull out of both sides from the oil-rich region.

The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the &quot;percentages agreement&quot; to divide the Balkans into respective spheres of influence, including giving Stalin predominance over Romania and Bulgaria and Churchill &quot;carte blanche&quot; over Greece. At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations. Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement, but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe.

At the Second Quebec Conference, a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12–16 September 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany based on Henry Morgenthau Jr.&#x27;s original proposal. The memorandum drafted by Churchill provided for &quot;eliminating the warmaking industries in the Ruhr and the Saar ... looking forward to converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character&quot;. However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states. On 10 May 1945, President Truman signed the US occupation directive JCS 1067, which was in effect for over two years, and was enthusiastically supported by Stalin. It directed the US forces of occupation to &quot;... take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany&quot;.

Some historians have argued that the Cold War began when the US negotiated a separate peace with Nazi SS General Karl Wolff in northern Italy. The Soviet Union was initially not allowed to participate and the dispute led to heated correspondence between Franklin Roosevelt and Stalin. General Wolff, a war criminal, appears to have been guaranteed immunity at the Nuremberg trials by Office of Strategic Services (OSS) commander (and later CIA director) Allen Dulles when they met in March 1945. Wolff and his forces were being considered to help implement Operation Unthinkable, a secret plan to invade the Soviet Union which Winston Churchill advocated during this period.

At the February 1945 Yalta Conference, the Allies attempted to define the framework for a postwar settlement in Europe. The Allies could not reach firm agreements on the crucial questions: the occupation of Germany, postwar reparations from Germany, and the fate of Poland. No final consensus was reached on Germany, other than to agree to a Soviet request for reparations totaling $10 billion &quot;as a basis for negotiations&quot;. Debates over the composition of Poland&#x27;s postwar government were also acrimonious. The Yalta Conference ended with &quot;a declaration on liberated Europe pledging respect for democratic forms and providing a diplomatic mechanism for constituting a generally acceptable Polish government&quot;.

Following the Allied victory in May, the Soviets effectively occupied Eastern Europe, while the US had much of Western Europe. In occupied Germany, the US and the Soviet Union established zones of occupation and a loose framework for four-power control with the ailing French and British.

===Potsdam and the atomic bomb===

At the Potsdam Conference starting in late July 1945, the Allies met to decide how to administer the defeated Nazi Germany, which had agreed to unconditional surrender nine weeks earlier on May 7 and May 8, 1945, VE day. Serious differences emerged over the future development of Germany and Eastern Europe. At Potsdam, the US was represented by a new president, Harry S. Truman, who on April 12 succeeded to the office upon Roosevelt&#x27;s death. Truman was unaware of Roosevelt&#x27;s plans for post-war engagement with the Soviet Union, and more generally uninformed about foreign policy and military matters. The new president, therefore, was initially reliant on a set of advisers (including Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman and Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal). This group tended to take a harder line towards Moscow than Roosevelt had done. Administration officials favoring cooperation with the Soviet Union and the incorporation of socialist economies into a world trade system were marginalized. The UK was represented by a new prime minister, Clement Attlee, who had replaced Churchill after the Labour Party&#x27;s defeat of the Conservatives in the 1945 general election.

The US had invited Britain into its atomic bomb project but kept it secret from the Soviet Union. Stalin became aware that the Americans were working on the atomic bomb through his spy network, however. One week after the end of the Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan. Stalin was also outraged by the actual dropping of the bombs, calling them a “superbarbarity” and claiming that “the balance has been destroyed ... That cannot be”. The Truman administration intended to use its ongoing nuclear weapons program to pressure the Soviet Union in international relations.

The immediate end of war material shipments from America to the USSR after the surrender of Germany also upset some politicians in Moscow, who believed this showed the US had no intentions to support the USSR any more than they had to. Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, good and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. After six weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.

==Creation of the Eastern Bloc==
A number of Eastern European countries (notably without Poland) were covered by Stalin&#x27;s secret agreement with Winston Churchill concluded at the 4th Moscow Conference in 1944 and called the Percentages Agreement. This only became known about in 1953 when Churchill published his memoirs. Resis&#x27; research illustrates that Roosevelt was well aware of this agreement but only gave conditional support to Churchill after receiving updated information regarding the talks; however, prior to the meeting Roosevelt had informed Stalin that &quot;in this global war, there is no question, political or military, that the United States is not interested&quot; and as such, the 4th October 1944 is arguably the day the Cold War started.

The immediate post-1945 period may have been the historical high point for the popularity of communist ideology. The burdens the Red Army and the Soviet Union endured had earned it massive respect which, had it been fully exploited by Joseph Stalin, had a good chance of resulting in a communist Europe. Communist parties achieved a significant popularity in Greece, France and Italy, as well as in some nations outside of Europe such as China, Iran or the Republic of Mahabad. Communist parties had already come to power in Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia. The United Kingdom and the United States were concerned that electoral victories by communist parties in any of these countries could lead to sweeping economic and political change in Western Europe.

After the war, Stalin sought to secure the Soviet Union&#x27;s western border by installing communist-dominated regimes under Soviet influence in bordering countries. During and in the years immediately after the war, the Soviet Union annexed several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Many of these were originally countries effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, before Germany invaded the Soviet Union. These later annexed territories include Eastern Poland (incorporated into two different SSRs), Latvia (became Latvia SSR), Estonia (became Estonian SSR), Lithuania (became Lithuania SSR), part of eastern Finland (Karelo-Finnish SSR and annexed into the Russian SFSR) and northern Romania (became the Moldavian SSR).

In Hungary, when the Soviets installed a communist government, Mátyás Rákosi was appointed General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, which began one of the harshest dictatorships in Europe under the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary. In Bulgaria, toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union crossed the border and created the conditions for a communist coup d&#x27;état on the following night. The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the communists whom he instructed, including Kimon Georgiev (who was not a communist himself, but a member of the elitarian political organization &quot;Zveno&quot;, working together with the communists), took full control of domestic politics in the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria. In the Romanian general election of 1946, the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) employed widespread intimidation tactics and electoral fraud to obtain 80 percent of the vote and, thereafter, eliminated the role of the centrist parties and forced mergers, the result of which was that, by 1948, most non-Communist politicians were either executed, in exile or in prison. In the December 1945 Albanian election, the only effective ballot choices were those of the communist Democratic Front (Albania), led by Enver Hoxha. In 1946, Albania was declared the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania.

The defining characteristic of the Stalinist communism implemented in Eastern Bloc states was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres. Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of market economies, democratic governance (dubbed &quot;bourgeois democracy&quot; in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state. They were economically communist and depended upon the Soviet Union for significant amounts of materials. While in the first five years following World War II, massive emigration from these states to the West occurred, restrictions implemented thereafter stopped most East-West migration, except that under limited bilateral and other agreements.

===Yugoslavia===
On 29 November 1945, the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed. It was under Soviet influence in the final months of the war and the first few post-war years, Stalin declared it outside the Soviet sphere of interest on several occasions, treating it like a satellite state. The contrast with the rest of Eastern Europe was underscored ahead of a Soviet offensive in October 1944. Tito&#x27;s Partisans supported the offensive, which ultimately pushed the Wehrmacht and its allies out of northern Serbia and captured Belgrade. Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin&#x27;s Third Ukrainian Front had to request formal permission from Tito&#x27;s provisional government to enter Yugoslavia and had to accept Yugoslav civil authority in any liberated territory. which maintained its claims against Italy and Austria. The territorial dispute in the northwest part of Istria peninsula and around the city of Trieste caused the Treaty of Peace with Italy to be delayed until 1947, and establishment of the independent Free Territory of Trieste. This did not satisfy Tito as he sought revisions of the borders around Trieste and in Carinthia prompting the Western Allies to keep a garrison in Trieste to prevent Yugoslav takeover. Tito&#x27;s continued insistence on acquisition of Trieste was also seen by Stalin as an embarrassment to the Italian Communist Party. On 10 January 1945, Stalin called Yugoslavia&#x27;s foreign policy unreasonable because of its territorial claims against most of its neighbours, The USSR and Yugoslavia signed a friendship treaty when Tito met with Stalin in Moscow in April 1945.

==Origins of containment==

===&quot;Long Telegram&quot; and &quot;Mr. X&quot;===

Key State Department personnel grew increasingly frustrated with and suspicious of the Soviets as the war drew to a close. Averell Harriman, US Ambassador in Moscow, once a &quot;confirmed optimist&quot; regarding US–Soviet relations, was disillusioned by what he saw as the Soviet betrayal of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as well as by violations of the February 1945 Yalta Agreement concerning Poland. Harriman would later have a significant influence in forming Truman&#x27;s views on the Soviet Union.

In February 1946, the US State Department asked George F. Kennan, then at the US Embassy in Moscow, why the Russians opposed the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He responded with a wide-ranging analysis of Russian policy now called the &quot;Long Telegram&quot;:

Kennan&#x27;s cable was hailed in the State Department as &quot;the appreciation of the situation that had long been needed.&quot; Kennan himself attributed the enthusiastic reception to timing: &quot;Six months earlier the message would probably have been received in the State Department with raised eyebrows and lips pursed in disapproval. Six months later, it would probably have sounded redundant.&quot; Clark Clifford and George Elsey produced a report elaborating on the &quot;Long Telegram&quot; and proposing concrete policy recommendations based on its analysis. This report, which recommended &quot;restraining and confining&quot; Soviet influence, was presented to Truman on September 24, 1946.

===&quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech===

On March 5, 1946, Winston Churchill, while at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, gave his speech &quot;The Sinews of Peace&quot;, declaring that an &quot;iron curtain&quot; had descended across Europe. From the standpoint of the Soviets, the speech was an incitement for the West to begin a war with the USSR, as it called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets.

===Morgenthau and Marshall Plans===

Having lost 20 million people in the war, suffered German invasion twice in 30 years, and suffered tens of millions of casualties from onslaughts from the West three times in the preceding 150 years, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany&#x27;s capacity for another war. This was in alignment with the Allied policy which had foreseen returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry (the Morgenthau Plan). On September 6, 1946, US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes made a speech in Germany, repudiating the Morgenthau Plan and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. (&quot;see&quot; Restatement of Policy on Germany) As Byrnes admitted one month later, &quot;The nub of our program was to win the German people [...] it was a battle between us and Russia over minds ...&quot;. Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the US government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes&#x27;s speech Restatement of Policy on Germany. In January 1947, Truman appointed General George Marshall as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067, which embodied the Morgenthau Plan and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany&quot;.

===Greece and Italy===

In Greece, during a civil war involving the communist-led partisan movement ELAS-EAM, British Special Forces terminated arms supplies to the ELA-ELAM, pro-monarchist armed forces were strengthened. On the political front, Americans, with British encouragement, attempted to dismantle ELAS-EAM socialist structures in the countryside, and an anti-communist swing gradually occurred.

Western Allies conducted meetings in Italy in March 1945 with German representatives to forestall a takeover by Italian communist resistance forces in northern Italy and to hinder the potential there for post-war influence of the civilian Italian Communist Party. The affair caused a major rift between Stalin and Churchill, and in a letter to Roosevelt on 3 April Stalin complained that the secret negotiations did not serve to &quot;preserve and promote trust between our countries&quot;.

===Soviet military perspective===
The Soviet military was focused on its main mission, the defense of the Soviet Union. From that perspective, the formation of NATO in 1949 was the decisive threat, and became its starting point for the Cold War. Historian David Glantz argues that:
:Militarily, the Soviets considered themselves threatened by, first, the United States&#x27;s atomic monopoly (broken in 1949) and, second, by the emergence of United States dominated military alliances, the most menacing of which was NATO. The Soviet Union responded strategically by preserving a large, expandable peacetime military establishment, keeping large military forces in conquered regions of Eastern Europe, and cloaking these forces within the political guise of an alliance (the Warsaw Pact), Which could contend with NATO on a multilateral basis. The major thrust of Soviet military strategy was to possess a conventional military force whose offensive capabilities could check Western nuclear and conventional military power.

==Other regions==
The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a somewhat different timing and trajectory outside Europe. In Africa, decolonization took place first; it was largely accomplished in the 1950s. The main rivals then sought bases of support in the new national political alignments.

===Latin America===
During World War II, the United States military operations had widespread support across Latin America, except for Argentina. After 1947, with the Cold War emerging in Europe, Washington made repeated efforts to encourage all the Latin American countries to take a Cold War anti-Communist position. They were reluctant to do so—for example, only Colombia sent soldiers to the United Nations Command in the Korean War. The Soviet Union was quite weak across Latin America. Not until the late 1950s did Moscow achieve diplomatic or commercial relationships with most Latin American countries., Before then it had only two trade agreements (with Argentina and Mexico). The communist movements that had existed in Brazil and elsewhere in the 1930s had been disbanded or outlawed. Washington exaggerated the dangers, and decided on a preemptive attack against a possible communist threat. It sought anti-communist resolutions at the annual meetings of the Pan American Union (renamed the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1948) and paid special attention to the growth of left-wing forces in Guatemala. A compromise was reached whereby the Latin American states agreed on vague statements of support for the American Cold War position, and the United States provided expanded financial grants and loans to stimulate economic growth. In 1954, at the 10th Inter-American Conference in Caracas, Washington demanded a resolution that the establishment of a communist government in any American state was a threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere. Guatemala cast the only negative vote. The Guatemalan Armed Forces, with CIA encouragement, overthrew its left-wing government later that year. Fidel Castro engineered his revolutionary takeover of Cuba in 1957–58 with very little Soviet support. The United States and the smaller Latin countries, outvoted the larger powers by the required two-thirds majority in 1962 to identify Cuba as a communist regime and suspend it from the OAS.

===Far East and Pacific===

After the war ended, British Malaya was plunged into a state of emergency as British and Commonwealth forces fought a protracted counter-insurgency war against their former communist-led Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army ally, who had fought the Japanese occupation and now demanded independence from the British Empire. In British Hong Kong, which had surrendered to Japan in December 1941, civil unrest occurred after Britain rapidly re-established rule at the end of the war.

Australia&#x27;s entry into the Cold War came in 1950, when it rushed combat air and sea forces into the Korean War, two days after the Americans did. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies received a hero&#x27;s welcome in Washington. The ANZUS military alliance with New Zealand and the United States was signed in July 1951; it was a plan for consultation and did not involve military planning like NATO. Public opinion in Australia was intensely hostile to Japan after its wartime atrocities, but Japan was now an ally in the Cold War, so Australia&#x27;s accepted the very generous soft peace treaty with Japan in 1951. Instead of worrying about a resurgent Japan, Australia now worried more about a possible Chinese threat.

===Asia===
Following decades of struggle, in 1949 the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong defeated Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army and took control of Mainland China. The Nationalist government leaders and much of the Republic of China&#x27;s upper class fled to Taiwan where they had American protection. Stalin had long supported Chiang Kai-shek, while also giving some help to the Communists. The United States had tried in 1945–1948 to bring the Nationalists and Communists together in a coalition, but had no success. The conflict was not therefore part of the Cold War until 1949–1959. By the late 1950s, however, China and the USSR were at sword&#x27;s point, and became bitter enemies over ideological control of the Marxist–Leninist orthodoxy. The two set up rival communist organizations in countries across the world. The Cold War then became a three-way conflict.

France for many years had been dealing with a nationalist insurgency in Vietnam in which communists, led by Ho Chi Minh, played a prominent leadership role. In 1949, Mao&#x27;s Communists took control of the north side of the China-Vietnam border, and began supporting the Viet Minh insurgents, especially by providing sanctuary from French attacks. Mark Lawrence and Frederik Logevall point out that &quot;resurgent French colonialism became inextricably intertwined with Cold War tensions, especially in the years after 1949&quot;. American pressure on France after 1949 tried to force France to give priority to helping the State of Vietnam and fighting communism, rather than fighting Vietnamese nationalism.

====Middle East====

The political situation in Iran was a flashpoint between the major players in 1945–1946, with the Soviet Union sponsoring two breakaway provinces in northern Iran, adjacent to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Soviet troops were stationed in northwestern Iran as part of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran during the war. They not only refused to withdraw in 1945 but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states called the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government and the Republic of Kurdistan. The issue was debated at the United Nations, and in 1946 Moscow abandoned its position, and the conflict was permanently resolved peacefully, with a pro-western government resuming control. Iran did not become a major battlefield of the Cold War, but it had its own history of confrontation with Britain and the United States.

The long-standing conflict between Arabs and Jews in Mandatory Palestine continued after 1945, with Britain and in an increasingly impossible situation as the mandate holder. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 calling for a homeland for the Jews was supported in 1947 by both the Soviet Union and the United States. Both countries promptly Recognize the independent state of Israel in 1948. The Soviet Union later broke with Israel to support its Arab enemies. The region was more of an independent trouble zone rather than a playing field of the Cold War, and was not a precipitating factor in the Cold War.

By 1953, Arab nationalism based in Egypt was a neutralizing force. The Soviet Union leaned increasingly toward Egypt. The United States based its Cold War coalition primarily on the Baghdad Pact of 1955 which formed Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), that included Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

==Historians on the causes of the Cold War==

While most historians trace its origins to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began with the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 when the Bolsheviks took power. In 1919 Lenin stated that his new state was surrounded by a &quot;hostile capitalist encirclement&quot;, and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon that should be used in order to keep the Soviet Union&#x27;s enemies divided. He began with a new Communist International (&quot;Comintern&quot;), based in Moscow, which was designed to plan for revolutionary upheavals abroad. It was ineffective—Communist uprisings all failed in Germany, Hungary and elsewhere. Historian Max Beloff argues that the Soviets saw &quot;no prospect of permanent peace&quot;, with the 1922 Soviet Constitution proclaiming:
:Since the time of the formation of the soviet republics, the states of the world have divided into two camps: the camp of capitalism and the camp of socialism. There—in the camp of capitalism—national enmity and inequality, colonial slavery, and chauvinism, national oppression and pogroms, imperialist brutalities and wars. Here —in the camp of socialism —mutual confidence and peace, national freedom and equality, a dwelling together in peace and the brotherly collaboration of peoples.

According to British historian Christopher Sutton:
:In what some have called the First Cold War, from Britain&#x27;s intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918 to its uneasy alliance with the Soviet Union against the Axis powers in 1941, British distrust of the revolutionary and regicidal Bolsheviks resulted in domestic, foreign, and colonial policies aimed at resisting the spread of communism. This conflict after 1945 took on new battlefields, new weapons, new players, and a greater intensity, but it was still fundamentally a conflict against Soviet imperialism (real and imagined).

The idea of long-term continuity is a minority scholarly view that has been challenged. Frank Ninkovich writes:
:As for the two cold wars thesis, the chief problem is that the two periods are incommensurable. To be sure, they were joined together by enduring ideological hostility, but in the post-World War I years Bolshevism was not a geopolitical menace. After World War II, in contrast, the Soviet Union was a superpower that combined ideological antagonism with the kind of geopolitical threat posed by Germany and Japan in the Second World War. Even with more amicable relations in the 1920s, it is conceivable that post-1945 relations would have turned out much the same.

The usage of the term &quot;Cold War&quot; to describe the postwar tensions between the US- and Soviet-led blocs was popularized by Bernard Baruch, a US financier and an adviser to Harry Truman, who used the term during a speech before the South Carolina state legislature on April 16, 1947.

Since the term &quot;Cold War&quot; was popularized in 1947, there has been extensive disagreement in many political and scholarly discourses on what exactly were the sources of postwar tensions. In the American historiography, there has been disagreement as to who was responsible for the quick unraveling of the wartime alliance between 1945 and 1947, and on whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable or could have been avoided. Discussion of these questions has centered in large part on the works of William Appleman Williams, Walter LaFeber, Gabriel Kolko and John Lewis Gaddis.

Officials in the Truman administration placed responsibility for postwar tensions on the Soviets, claiming that Stalin had violated promises made at Yalta, pursued a policy of expansionism in Eastern Europe, and conspired to spread communism throughout the world. Historians associated with the &quot;Wisconsin School&quot; of diplomatic history such as Williams, however, placed responsibility for the breakdown of postwar peace mostly on the US, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II. According to Williams and later writers influenced by his work—such as LaFeber, author of the popular survey text &quot;America, Russia, and the Cold War&quot; (published in ten editions between 1967 and 2006)—US policymakers shared an overarching concern with maintaining capitalism domestically. In order to ensure this goal, they pursued a policy of ensuring an &quot;Open Door&quot; to foreign markets for US business and agriculture across the world. From this perspective, a growing economy domestically went hand-in-hand with the consolidation of US power internationally.

Williams and LaFeber also dismissed the assumption that Soviet leaders were committed to postwar &quot;expansionism&quot;. They cited evidence that Soviet Union&#x27;s occupation of Eastern Europe had a defensive rationale, and Soviet leaders saw themselves as attempting to avoid encirclement by the United States and its allies. From this view, the Soviet Union was so weak and devastated after the end of the Second World War as to be unable to pose any serious threat to the US, which emerged after 1945 as the sole world power not economically devastated by the war, and also as the sole possessor of the atomic bomb until 1949.

Gaddis, however, argues that the conflict was less the lone fault of one side or the other and more the result of a plethora of conflicting interests and misperceptions between the two superpowers, propelled by domestic politics and bureaucratic inertia. While Gaddis does not hold either side as entirely responsible for the onset of the conflict, he argues that the Soviets should be held at least slightly more accountable for the problems. According to Gaddis, Stalin was in a much better position to compromise than his Western counterparts, given his much broader power within his own regime than Truman, who had to contend with Congress and was often undermined by vociferous political opposition at home. Asking if it were possible to predict if the wartime alliance would fall apart within a matter of months, leaving in its place nearly a half century of cold war, Gaddis wrote in a 1997 essay, &quot;Geography, demography, and tradition contributed to this outcome but did not determine it. It took men, responding unpredictably to circumstances, to forge the chain of causation; and it took [Stalin] in particular, responding predictably to his own authoritarian, paranoid, and narcissistic predisposition, to lock it into place&quot;.

Global historian Prasenjit Duara has placed the issue in a global context: 
:The Cold War is increasingly treated as a global historical period beginning customarily in 1947 when the Truman Doctrine sought to contain communism and the expansion of Soviet influence, and ending with the decline and fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s.

<text>The &quot;Gawain Poet&quot; ( ; late 14th century), or less commonly the &quot;Pearl Poet&quot;, is the name given to the author of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, an alliterative poem written in 14th-century Middle English. Its author appears also to have written the poems &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Cleanness&quot;; some scholars suggest the author may also have composed &quot;Saint Erkenwald&quot;. Save for the last (found in BL-MS &quot;Harley 2250&quot;), all these works are known from a single surviving manuscript, the British Library holding &#x27;Cotton MS&#x27; &quot;Nero A.x.&quot; This body of work includes some of the most highly-regarded poetry written in Middle English.

The Gawain Poet is unidentified. Various scholars have suggested that the poem is attributable to a member of the landed Massey family of Cheshire, and in particular John Massey of Cotton. This is not widely accepted, however, and the labels &quot;Pearl Poet&quot; or &quot;Gawain Poet&quot; are still preferred.

==Conjectured biography==
The language of the poems shows that the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, and William Langland, who are sometimes (following the suggestion of academic John Burrow) collectively called the Ricardian Poets in reference to the reign of Richard II of England. All four poems of the Cotton MS Nero A X manuscript are in the same Middle English dialect, localised to the area of north-western Staffordshire, north east Shropshire and south-eastern Cheshire, in the English Midlands. This may merely indicate the dialect of the scribe responsible for copying the poems, but there is good evidence that the dialect of poet and scribe were very similar. It is, therefore, thought most likely that the poet was a native of north Shropshire, east Cheshire or west Staffordshire and was writing in the latter part of the 14th century: based particularly on the narrative voice of &quot;Pearl&quot;, the poet is thought to have been male. Internal evidence indicates that all four works were probably written by the same author, though their similar dialect and presence in the same manuscript have usually been taken as the strongest evidence of common authorship.

Any other information must be deduced from the poems&#x27; themes, as there is neither a definite authorial attribution within them nor any &#x27;tradition&#x27; as to the author&#x27;s identity (as with Langland and &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;). The poet seems to have been well-educated; shows a deep knowledge of the technical vocabulary of hunting, as in the description of the horn signals in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;; also shows some knowledge of royal courts; vividly describes the landscape of the region; and has an interest in poverty as a Christian virtue. However, the writer of the Cotton MS Nero A X poems never refers to contemporary scholarship, as, for example, Chaucer does. The poems show a tendency to refer to materials from the past (the Arthurian legends, stories from the Bible) rather than any new learning, so it is perhaps less possible to associate the poet with universities, monasteries or the court in London. Even so, the Gawain Poet must have been educated and was probably of a certain social standing, perhaps a member of a family of landed gentry. J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the allusions, style, and themes of &quot;Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, concluded in 1925:
The poet began writing during a time of rapid change and development in English literature. His language was arguably also influenced by 14th-century social developments, particularly the movement toward a more anglicised ruling class and political identity, and by changes in the English language, primarily driven by exposure to dialects of French. The sophistication of the poet&#x27;s literary style, and his references to pursuits such as heraldry and hunting, suggest a writer aiming at a cultured audience.

In their use of Latin, &quot;Purity&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;Pearl&quot; show the poet&#x27;s knowledge of the Vulgate Bible. In &quot;Pearl&quot; the poet shows knowledge not only of the Book of Revelation, but also of many other parts of the Bible. It is possible that the poet consulted Latin commentaries on Revelation and Genesis. The work makes use of well-established Christian interpretations of elements in the Old Testament, such as treating Jonah&#x27;s descent into the whale as a form of Christ&#x27;s descent into Hell, or using Abraham&#x27;s three angels as a type of the Trinity. What most interested the poet, however, seems to have been the literal sense of Biblical sources as opposed to their typological or allegorical significance.

&quot;Pearl&quot; also shows the poet&#x27;s understanding of mystical theology. It is pointed out that the Dreamer&#x27;s definition of his vision as a &#x27;gostly drem&#x27; (Line 790) indicates the poet&#x27;s familiarity with the classification of visions used by mystical theologians and the mystics themselves. There is no need to suggest any extraordinary learning on the poet&#x27;s part; most of the devotional writings were widely and easily understood.

It is difficult to find evidence that the poet shared knowledge of classical poets, such as Virgil and Ovid, with the likes of Chaucer. However, there have been claims that certain small debts can be detected in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; to Virgil and to Seneca the Younger, and it is highly likely that the poet was familiar with a wide range of Latin literature that was current among the educated class in the Middle Ages.

The chronology of the &quot;Alliterative Revival&quot; of which these works are a significant part, cannot be established with any precision. It is assumed that the revival began in the south-west midlands and fully flowered in the late fourteenth century. While Cheshire monasteries were not as well endowed as those in the south-west midlands, they would have included the main Latin works used as sources by the alliterative poets. Dating the works written by the Gawain-poet is most problematic because the works could have been written as early as the 1360s or as late as the manuscript itself, which dates around 1400. It is assumed that the poet was alive during the mid-1370s to mid-1380s. The British Library Cotton MS Nero A X is the only surviving Middle English manuscript collection consisting solely of alliterative poems. There is firm consensus that the dialect of the scribe and the author localises the poem to the north-west Midlands, centring on Cheshire. To present the historical background of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and associated poems is ultimately a quest to find the anonymous poet. The notion that the Gawain-poet was attached to a provincial noble household, perhaps like that of Sir Bertilak, remains attractive to a number of critics. The quest for the Green Chapel brings Sir Gawain into Cheshire from Wales. Sir Robert Grosvenor, Sheriff of Chester was born at Hulme, Cheshire, England and is an appropriate reference-point in the investigation for the world of the poet. Grosvenor&#x27;s manor house at Hulme is only a few miles north of the area pin-pointed by dialectologists, on the uplands associated with the Green Chapel mentioned in the poem.

==Theories as to possible identity==

===John Prat, John Donne===
A number of scholars have proposed that &quot;Pearl&quot; was written to commemorate the daughter of John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, and two of his clerks, John Prat and John Donne, have been advanced as possible candidates for authorship.

===&quot;Huchoun&quot;===

A theory current in the early part of the 20th century held that a man called Huchoun (&quot;little Hugh&quot;) may have authored the poems, having been credited with several works, including at least one known to be in the alliterative form, in the Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun. As Cotton MS Nero A X contains the words &quot;Hugo de&quot; added in a later hand, its contents were identified with some of the works mentioned by Wyntoun.

This argument, made in greatest detail by a Scottish antiquarian, George Neilson (who claimed that Hugh was a Scottish knight, Hugh of Eglington), is nowadays disregarded, mainly because the poems attributed to Hugh seem to have been composed in widely varying dialects.

===John (or Hugh) Massey===
The surname of Massey, that of a prominent Cheshire family, is associated with &quot;St Erkenwald&quot;, a poem occasionally claimed to be another of the Pearl poet&#x27;s works; the names of Thomas Massey and Elizabeth Booth (a member of the Booth family of Dunham Massey) are written in &quot;St Erkenwald&quot;″s manuscript.

In 1956, Ormerod Greenwood, working on a translation of &quot;Gawain&quot;, made the suggestion that the author of &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Gawain&quot; was one of the Masseys of Sale. He suggested Hugh Massey, based on a number of puns he found incorporated in &quot;Pearl&quot; (in addition to the &quot;Hugo de&quot; inscription in Cotton MS Nero A X) Given the obvious link through the name &quot;Hugh&quot;, Hugh Massey has been conflated with Huchoun by some academics.

A later suggestion is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire; this was first put forward by Nolan and Farley-Hills in 1971. John Massey&#x27;s authorship is further supported, according to Nolan, by one of Thomas Hoccleve&#x27;s poems, in which Hoccleve mentions &quot;my maister Massy&quot;, indicating him to be a fearsome critic of poetic metre. The attribution to John Massey is not, however, widely supported by modern critics of the poem.

===John Stanley===
Andrew Breeze has suggested Sir John Stanley (c. 1350–1414) as a possible identity for the poet. He was a Knight of the Garter, and the presence at the end of &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; of the Garter motto, there rendered &quot;Honi soit qui mal pense&quot; is put forward in support. He was also familiar with hunting and armoury, as described in &quot;Gawain&quot;, and came from the appropriate part of England. This theory follows on from Gervase Mathews proposal of Stanley as the poet&#x27;s patron.

===Richard Newton===
Bennett (1979) suggested that &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; was written by an ancestor of the north-western landowner Humphrey Newton, who appears to have been familiar with the poem in the 16th century. Richard Newton, some of whose occasional verse in the late fourteenth century has survived, was suggested as a candidate, based on perceived stylistic similarities of his work to parts of &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;. The theory was not widely accepted.

<text>A traction control system (TCS), is typically (but not necessarily) a secondary function of the electronic stability control (ESC) on production motor vehicles, designed to prevent loss of traction (i.e., wheelspin) of the driven road wheels. TCS is activated when throttle input and engine power and torque transfer are mismatched to the road surface conditions. 

The intervention consists of one or more of the following:
*Brake force applied to one or more wheels
*Reduction or suppression of spark sequence to one or more cylinders
*Reduction of fuel supply to one or more cylinders
*Closing the throttle, if the vehicle is fitted with drive by wire throttle
*In turbocharged vehicles, a boost control solenoid is actuated to reduce boost and therefore engine power.

Typically, traction control systems share the electrohydraulic brake actuator (which does not use the conventional master cylinder and servo) and wheel-speed sensors with ABS.

The basic idea behind the need for a traction control system is the loss of road grip can compromise steering control and stability of vehicles. This is the result of the difference in traction of the drive wheels. The difference in slip may occur due to the turning of a vehicle or varying road conditions for different wheels. When a car turns, its outer and inner wheels rotate at different speeds; this is conventionally controlled by using a differential. A further enhancement of the differential is to employ an active differential that can vary the amount of power being delivered to outer and inner wheels as needed. For example, if outward slip is sensed while turning, the active differential may deliver more power to the outer wheel in order to minimize the yaw (essentially the degree to which the front and rear wheels of a car are out of line.)
Active differential, in turn, is controlled by an assembly of electromechanical sensors collaborating with a traction control unit.

==History==
The predecessor of modern electronic traction control systems can be found in high-torque, high-power rear-wheel-drive cars as a limited slip differential. A limited-slip differential is a purely mechanical system that transfers a relatively small amount of power to the non-slipping wheel, while still allowing some wheel spin to occur.

In 1971, Buick introduced &quot;MaxTrac&quot;, which used an early computer system to detect rear wheel spin and modulate engine power to those wheels to provide the most traction. A Buick exclusive item at the time, it was an option on all full-size models, including the Riviera, Estate Wagon, Electra 225, Centurion, and LeSabre.

Cadillac introduced the &quot;Traction Monitoring System&quot; (TMS) in 1979 on the redesigned Eldorado.

==Operation==
When the traction control computer (often incorporated into another control unit, such as the ABS module) detects one or more driven wheels spinning significantly faster than another, it invokes the ABS electronic control unit to apply brake friction to wheels spinning with lessened traction. Braking action on slipping wheel(s) will cause power transfer to wheel axle(s) with traction due to the mechanical action within the differential. All-wheel-drive (AWD) vehicles often have an electronically controlled coupling system in the transfer case or transaxle engaged (active part-time AWD), or locked-up tighter (in a true full-time set up driving all wheels with some power all the time) to supply non-slipping wheels with torque.

This often occurs in conjunction with the powertrain computer reducing available engine torque by electronically limiting throttle application and/or fuel delivery, retarding ignition spark, completely shutting down engine cylinders, and a number of other methods, depending on the vehicle and how much technology is used to control the engine and transmission. There are instances when traction control is undesirable, such as trying to get a vehicle unstuck in snow or mud. Allowing one wheel to spin can propel a vehicle forward enough to get it unstuck, whereas both wheels applying a limited amount of power will not produce the same effect. Many vehicles have a traction control shut-off switch for such circumstances.

==Components of traction control==
Generally, the main hardware for traction control and ABS are mostly the same. In many vehicles, traction control is provided as an additional option for ABS.

* Each wheel is equipped with a sensor that senses changes in its speed due to loss of traction.
* The sensed speed from the individual wheels is passed on to an electronic control unit (ECU).
* The ECU processes the information from the wheels and initiates braking to the affected wheels via a cable connected to an automatic traction control (ATC) valve.

In all vehicles, traction control is automatically started when the sensors detect loss of traction at any of the wheels.

==Use of traction control==
*In road cars: Traction control has traditionally been a safety feature in premium high-performance cars, which otherwise need sensitive throttle input to prevent spinning driven wheels when accelerating, especially in wet, icy, or snowy conditions. In recent years, traction control systems have become widely available in non-performance cars, minivans, and light trucks and in some small hatchbacks. 
*In race cars: Traction control is used as a performance enhancement, allowing maximum traction under acceleration without wheel spin. When accelerating out of a turn, it keeps the tires at optimal slip ratio.
*In heavy trucks: Traction control is available as well. Here the pneumatic brake system needs some additional valves and control logic to realize a TCS (or sometimes called ASR) system.
*In motorcycles: Traction control for production motorcycles was first available with the BMW K1 in 1988. Honda offered Traction Control as an option, along with ABS, on their ST1100 beginning about 1992. By 2009, traction control was an option for several models offered by BMW and Ducati, the model year 2010 Kawasaki Concours 14 (1400GTR) and Honda CBR 650R in the year 2019, and Triumph &quot;Modern Classic&quot; line of motorcycles.
*In off-road vehicles: Traction control is used instead of or in addition to, the mechanical limited-slip or locking differential. It is often implemented with an electronic limited-slip differential, as well as other computerized controls of the engine and transmission. The spinning wheel is slowed with short applications of brakes, diverting more torque to the non-spinning wheel; this is the system adopted by Range Rover in 1993, for example. ABS brake-traction control has several advantages over limited-slip and locking differentials, such as steering control of a vehicle is easier, so the system can be continuously enabled. It also creates less stress on powertrain and driveline components, and increases durability as there are fewer moving parts to fail.

When programmed or calibrated for off-road use, traction control systems like Ford’s four-wheel electronic traction control (ETC) which is included with &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot;, and Porsche’s four-wheel automatic brake differential (ABD), can send 100 percent of torque to any one wheel or wheels, via an aggressive brake strategy or &quot;brake locking&quot;, allowing vehicles like the Expedition and Cayenne to keep moving, even with two wheels (one front, one rear) completely off the ground.

===Use in motorsports===
Very effective yet small units are available that allow the driver to remove the traction control system after an event if desired. In Formula One, an effort to ban traction control led to a change of rules for 2008: every car must have a standard (but custom mappable) ECU, issued by the FIA, which is relatively basic and does not have traction control capabilities. In 2003, Paul Tracy admitted that CART teams used traction control in the nineties, a device that was not formally legal until 2002 (although the switch to single engine supplier for 2003 reverted the legalization). In 2008, NASCAR suspended a Whelen Modified Tour driver, crew chief, and car owner for one race and disqualified the team after finding questionable wiring in the ignition system, which could have been used to implement traction control.

==Traction control in cornering==
Traction control is not just used for improving acceleration under slippery conditions. It can also help a driver to corner more safely. If too much throttle is applied during cornering, the driven wheels will lose traction and slide sideways. This occurs as understeer in front-wheel-drive vehicles and oversteer in rear-wheel-drive vehicles. Traction control can mitigate and possibly even correct understeer or oversteer from happening by limiting power to the overdriven wheel or wheels. However, it cannot increase the limits of frictional grip available and is used only to decrease the effect of driver error or compensate for a driver&#x27;s inability to react quickly enough to wheel slip.

Automobile manufacturers state in vehicle manuals that traction control systems should not encourage dangerous driving or encourage driving in conditions beyond the driver&#x27;s control.

<doc id="420967" wikidata="Q3848233" url="?curid=420967" title="Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>The Church of Christ was the original name of the Latter Day Saint church founded by Joseph Smith. Organized informally in 1829 in upstate New York and then formally on April 6, 1830, it was the first organization to implement the principles found in Smith&#x27;s newly published Book of Mormon, and thus its establishment represents the formal beginning of the Latter Day Saint movement. Later names for this organization included the Church of the Latter Day Saints (by 1834 resolution), the Church of Jesus Christ, the Church of God, the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (by an 1838 revelation).

Smith and his associates asserted that the Church of Christ was a restoration of the 1st-century early Christian church, which Smith claimed had fallen from God&#x27;s favor and authority because of what he called a &quot;Great Apostasy&quot;. After Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, there was a crisis of authority, with the majority of the members following Brigham Young to the Salt Lake Valley, but with several smaller denominations remaining in Illinois or settling in Missouri and in other states. Each of the churches that resulted from this schism considers itself to be the rightful continuation of Smith&#x27;s original &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, regardless of the name they may currently bear (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Community of Christ, The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), Church of Christ (Temple Lot), etc.).

This church is unrelated to other bodies bearing the same name, including the United Church of Christ, a Reformed church body, and the Churches of Christ, who have roots in the Restoration movement. Today, there are several Latter Day Saint denominations called &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, largely within the Hedrickite branch of the movement.

==Doctrinal development prior to 1830==
The first Latter Day Saint references to the &quot;church of Christ&quot; are found in passages of the Book of Mormon that Smith dictated from April to June 1829. During the course of this dictation, the outlines for a community of believers or church structure gradually became apparent. Such a structure would have authority from God, ordinances such as baptism, and ordained clergy. Some time in April 1829, Smith dictated a story of Alma the Elder, the former priest of a wicked king, who baptized his followers by immersion, &quot;having authority from the Almighty God&quot;, and called his community of believers the &quot;church of God, or the church of Christ&quot;. The book described the clergy in Alma&#x27;s church as consisting of priests, who were unpaid and were to &quot;preach nothing save it were repentance and faith in the Lord&quot;. Alma later established many churches (or congregations), which were considered &quot;one church&quot; because &quot;there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.&quot; In addition to priests, the book mentions that the clergy of these churches also included teachers.

Nevertheless, in May 1829, a revelation by Smith described the &quot;church&quot; in informal terms: &quot;Behold, this is my doctrine: whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church: whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me: therefore, he is not of my church.&quot; Smith&#x27;s further dictation of the Book of Mormon also stated that there were &quot;two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil&quot;.

Also in May 1829, Smith and Oliver Cowdery said they were visited by John the Baptist in angelic form, who conferred the Aaronic priesthood on them, which included the authority to baptize in Jesus Christ&#x27;s name. Smith and Cowdery then baptized each other by immersion. They also baptized dozens of people, as early as June 1829. These converts, however, did not belong to a formal church organization. Nevertheless, this community of believers referred to themselves as &quot;the Church of Christ&quot;, and included converts in three New York towns: Fayette, Manchester, and Colesville.

In June 1829, Smith dictated a revelation stating that &quot;in [the Book of Mormon] are all things written, concerning my church, my gospel, and my rock. Wherefore if you shall build up my church, and my gospel, and my rock, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.&quot; Some time between June and December 1829, Cowdery said he received a revelation about &quot;how he should build up his church &amp; the manner thereof&quot;. This revelation was called the &quot;Articles of the Church of Christ&quot;, and it indicated that the church should ordain priests and teachers &quot;according to the gifts &amp; callings of God unto men&quot;. The church was to meet regularly to partake of bread and wine. Cowdery was described as &quot;an Apostle of Jesus Christ&quot;. According to David Whitmer, by April 1830, this informal &quot;Church of Christ&quot; had about six elders and 70 members.

==Organization of the church==
On April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and a group of approximately 30 believers met with the intention of formally organizing the Church of Christ into a legal institution. It is uncertain whether this occurred in the home of Peter Whitmer Sr. in Fayette, New York, or whether it occurred in the log home of Joseph Smith Sr. near their property in Manchester, New York. Soon after this formal organization, small branches were formally established in Manchester, Fayette, and Colesville. Although the purpose was to effect a legal organization, it may have had no legal effect since no records of incorporation have been found in either the Manchester–Palmyra area, the Fayette area, or in several other counties around this time period, as required by state law at the time: the church evidently did not follow the required legal formalities.

===Location of the organization===
Prior to 1834, all church publications and documents stated that the church was organized in the Smith log home in Manchester, New York. The first Smith log home was located on the Samuel Jennings property in Palmyra, just north of the town&#x27;s southern border and subsequent the Smith Manchester property. The Smiths may have constructed a second log home on their own property. Beginning in 1834, several church publications began to give the location of the organizational meeting as Fayette, at the home of Peter Whitmer Sr. The Whitmer home had been the site of many other meetings near the same time period. After 1834, several official church accounts said the meeting was in Manchester and several eyewitnesses said the event took place in Manchester.

Independent researcher H. Michael Marquardt argues that the evidence suggests the organization occurred in Manchester, and that the confusion was likely due to the effect of memory tending to conflate memories of several meetings in Manchester and Fayette years earlier. Critics suggest that the location of the organization was intentionally changed in 1834 around the same time the church&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot;, in order to make it seem like the new church organization was different from the &quot;Church of Christ&quot;, as a tactic to frustrate the church&#x27;s creditors and avoid payment of debts.

There is also evidence pointing to Fayette as the place of organization. For example, a headnote to the earliest known version of chapter XXII of the Book of Commandments says that the revelation was dictated in Fayette on April 6, 1830, after the church was organized. This was changed to &quot;Manchester&quot; when the book was published in 1833. Officially, the major denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement claim Fayette as the birthplace of the religion, and Smith&#x27;s official history, begun in 1838, listed Fayette as the founding place. In 1887, one other eye-witness, David Whitmer, recollected that the event occurred in his father&#x27;s home in Fayette; however, years earlier, in 1875, Whitmer had already told a reporter that the event occurred in Manchester. Marquardt argues that the event described by Whitmer in 1887 bears more resemblance to Fayette meetings such as the founding of the church&#x27;s Fayette branch five days later on April 11, 1830.

The largest successor organization to the Church of Christ, the LDS Church, accepts Fayette as the official location of the organizing meeting.

===Events at the organization===

By later accounts, the April 6 organizational meeting was a charismatic event, in which members of the congregation had visions, prophesied, spoke in tongues, ecstatically shouted praises to the Lord, and fainted. At this meeting, the church formally ordained a lay ministry, with the priesthood offices of deacon, teacher, priest, and elder. Smith and Cowdery, according to their 1831 account, were each ordained as &quot;an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church&quot;. This account was edited in 1835 to state that Smith was ordained the &quot;First Elder&quot;, and Oliver Cowdery was ordained the &quot;Second Elder&quot;.

===First members of the church===

According to the LDS Church, the first six members of the Church of Christ were:

* Oliver Cowdery
* Joseph Smith
* Hyrum Smith
* Peter Whitmer Jr.
* Samuel H. Smith
* David Whitmer

Early membership also included the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon and members of the extended Whitmer and Smith families. Other early members included friends and acquaintances of the Smith and Whitmer families, such as Porter Rockwell.

==The name of the church==

===Historical background===

Smith&#x27;s revelations authorized and commanded the organization of the &quot;Church of Christ&quot; in 1830, and in several of the revelations Smith said he received, God referred to the church by that name. Smith taught that this church was a restoration of the primitive Christian church established by Jesus in the 1st century AD. Smith also taught that this restoration occurred in the &quot;Latter Days&quot; of the world, that is, the time immediately prior to the Second Coming of Jesus.

===Early changes===
The fact that a number of the churches of the Restoration Movement were also named the &quot;Church of Christ&quot; caused a considerable degree of confusion in the first years of the Latter Day Saint movement. Because of the distinct belief in the Book of Mormon among Smith&#x27;s followers, people outside the church began to refer them as &quot;Mormonites&quot; or &quot;Mormons.&quot; Smith and other church elders considered the name &quot;Mormon&quot; derogatory. In May 1834, the church adopted a resolution that the church would be known thereafter as &quot;The Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot;. At various times the church was also referred to as &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ&quot;, &quot;The Church of God&quot;, and &quot;The Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;.

In the late 1830s, Smith and those loyal to him founded a new headquarters in Far West, Missouri. At Far West in 1838, Smith announced a revelation renaming the organization the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;.

===Later variations===
Up to the time of Smith&#x27;s death, the church was known alternatively as the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; or the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints&quot;, that is, with or without a hyphen. After Smith&#x27;s death, competing Latter Day Saint denominations organized under the leadership of a number of successors. The largest of these, led by Brigham Young and now based in Salt Lake City, Utah, continued using &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; until incorporating in 1851, when the church standardized the spelling of its name as &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot; (LDS Church). Followers of James J. Strang use the spelling of the public domain name, &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot;, as the name of their church.

The name &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; was also used by members who recognized Smith&#x27;s son, Joseph Smith III, as his father&#x27;s successor. The younger Smith became prophet-president of this group on April 6, 1860. However, the church incorporated in 1872 as the &quot;Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; (RLDS Church), to distinguish it from the larger Utah church, at the time in the midst of federal issues related to polygamy. In 2001, the RLDS Church changed its name again to &quot;Community of Christ&quot;—consciously echoing the original &quot;Church of Christ&quot; name.

The Sidney Rigdon group dwindled until one of its elders, William Bickerton, reorganized in 1862 under the name &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ&quot;. Other Latter Day Saint denominations returned to the original name or a variation of the name, including the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), and the now-extinct Church of Christ (Whitmerite).

==Succession claims==

Virtually every Latter Day Saint denomination claims to be the rightful successor to the original Church of Christ and claims Joseph Smith as its founding prophet or first president. For example, the LDS Church, Community of Christ, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), Church of Christ (Temple Lot), and Church of Christ with the Elijah Message all claim to have been organized by Smith on April 6, 1830, the date on which the Church of Christ was organized. Other denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), acknowledge that their organizations were created after this date, but nevertheless claim to be a re-establishment of the original church.

In an 1880 lawsuit, an Ohio court held that the RLDS Church was the lawful successor to Smith&#x27;s original Church of Christ. The court also explicitly held that the LDS Church was not the lawful successor because it &quot;has materially and largely departed from the faith, doctrines, law, ordinances and usages of the said original Church&quot;. These holdings were preliminary findings of fact based on the RLDS Church&#x27;s unopposed legal submissions; the court issued no final judgment on the matter because the case was dismissed.

In 1894, a federal United States court in Missouri held again that the RLDS Church was the lawful successor to the original church. However, on appeal the entire case was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit without any discussion by the court of the issue of legal succession.

<text>N.E.R.D. (a backronym of No-one Ever Really Dies) was an American rock and hip-hop band, formed in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 1994. Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo were signed by Teddy Riley to Virgin. After producing songs for several artists throughout the late 1990s, Williams and Hugo formed the band with Shay Haley as a side project band of the Neptunes in 1994. N.E.R.D.&#x27;s debut album, &quot;In Search of...&quot;, sold 603,000 copies in the United States and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also awarded the second annual Shortlist Music Prize. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Fly or Die&quot;, sold 412,000 copies in the United States, but shipped at least 500,000 units, certifying it Gold.

In 2005, N.E.R.D. ended their contract with Virgin and disbanded. Three years later, the band reunited under Star Trak Entertainment, a subsidiary of Interscope Records established by Williams and Hugo. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Seeing Sounds&quot;, released in 2008, sold just under 80,000 copies in its first week. The album was followed by &quot;Nothing&quot;, which was released in 2010.

==History==
===Formation and early career===
Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo met at the age of 12 at a band class in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Hugo was the drum major for the Kempsville High School Marching Chiefs, under the direction of current University of Virginia Band Director, William Pease, while Williams was a drumline member of the Fabulous Marching Cavaliers (FMC) of Princess Anne High School, both of Virginia Beach. They spent their free time making beats and performing in groups with fellow childhood friends Missy Elliott, Clipse, and Timbaland &amp; Magoo. Williams and Hugo met Shay Haley in high school and began performing together. The trio often met in Hugo&#x27;s garage, where he beatboxed through a speaker system while Haley danced. After watching the duo perform at a high school talent show, producer Teddy Riley signed Williams and Hugo in 1991. After producing songs for several artists throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the production duo formed N.E.R.D. in 1994 as a side project known for their appearance on &quot;Ghetto Children&quot; off Kelis&#x27; debut album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;.

===2001–2002: &quot;In Search of...&quot;===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;In Search of...&quot;, was released in Europe in September 2001. Williams and Hugo used similar digital production techniques as they did for other artists. However, the band decided that they wanted to sound different from their previous work. This led them to rerecording the album using live instruments with rock band Spymob for a worldwide release in 2002. The album debuted at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaked at number 56. It failed to replicate the success of the Neptunes&#x27; previous productions. The album won the second annual Shortlist Music Prize, an accolade awarded to albums released in the United States that have not achieved mainstream success and have sales of 500,000 copies or less at the time of nomination. The album sold 603,000 copies in the United States and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Lapdance&quot;, peaked at number 36 of the Hot Rap Tracks chart and number 85 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The second single, &quot;Rock Star&quot;, peaked at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. A 6.1 surround mix of this album was released by DTS Entertainment on a DVD-Audio disc in 2005. The original version of the album is a collectors&#x27; item.

===2003–2004: &quot;Fly or Die&quot;===
The band recorded its second album, &quot;Fly or Die&quot;, in 2003. They learned to play the songs live, as Chad Hugo told MTV News on December 9, 2003: &quot;We&#x27;re the ones playing the instruments live this time. I just started playing guitar last year so I&#x27;m learning as we go. Pharrell&#x27;s playing drums. [Last time] we didn&#x27;t have time to learn certain instruments so we got Spymob to help us out.&quot;

&quot;Fly or Die&quot; was released in March 2004. The album debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 119,000 copies in its first week. The album sold 412,000 copies in the United States and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The first single, &quot;She Wants to Move&quot;, has gone top 5 in the United Kingdom, top 20 in Norway, Ireland, and Denmark, and top 40 in Australia and the Netherlands. The music videos for &quot;She Wants to Move&quot; and its follow-up single, &quot;Maybe&quot;, have received strong support from the digital cable network VH1 Soul in America.

===2005–2008: Hiatus and &quot;Seeing Sounds&quot;===
In 2005, N.E.R.D. ended their contract with Virgin Records over a label dispute and the band disbanded. While touring, the band became &quot;hooked&quot; on the energy from their fans, which led them to begin recording their third studio album, spending their own money while still unsigned. Williams and Hugo later established Star Trak Entertainment, a subsidiary of Interscope Records. In March 2008, the band performed at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. While there they filmed a PSA for Rock the Vote saying why they thought voting was important and the issues they cared about that election year.

From April to June 2008, the band toured with Kanye West as an opening act along with Rihanna and Lupe Fiasco as part of the Glow in the Dark Tour. On June 13, they gave an energetic performance at the Isle of Wight festival, however they almost missed their scheduled show because they didn&#x27;t know where the island was. On June 25, they performed in front of 40,000 people at the Isle of MTV 2008 at the Floriana granaries, Malta with free admission.
On August 9, 2008, the band played at the Way Out West music festival held in the city park of Gothenburg, Sweden. In September 2008, N.E.R.D. performed to a sold-out crowd at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois, and brought special guest Bad Brains onstage. N.E.R.D. released their third studio album, &quot;Seeing Sounds&quot; in June 2008. The first single off the album, titled &quot;Everyone Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)&quot;, was first mentioned on their Billionaire Boys Club blog in January 2008. The second single off the album, titled &quot;Spaz&quot;, was used in a television commercial for the Microsoft Zune. The group toured with American rock band, Linkin Park on the European leg of their Projekt Revolution tour in 2008 with artists like HIM, the Used and Jay-Z. The group also played at the National Bowl, Milton Keynes before the recording of Road to Revolution by Linkin Park.

===2009–present: &quot;Nothing&quot; and &quot;No One Ever Really Dies&quot;===
In 2009, a song entitled &quot;Soldier&quot; featuring Santigold and Lil Wayne was featured on the soundtrack of the teen drama series &quot;90210&quot;. In 2010, N.E.R.D. announced the release of their fourth studio album entitled &quot;Nothing&quot;, which had a scheduled release date for September 7, 2010, but was pushed back to November 2, 2010. The first single from the album, &quot;Hot-n-Fun&quot; (featuring Nelly Furtado), was released on May 18, 2010, on iTunes. It was released in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2010. On August 20, 2010, a track titled &quot;Party People&quot; leaked onto the internet. It was rumored to be the second single from the album. On September 28, 2010, they premiered another track from the album titled &quot;Hypnotize U&quot;, produced by electronic music duo Daft Punk, on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. On September 30, 2010, in an interview with Mark Hoppus on &quot;A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus&quot;, Williams explained the album cover as &quot;a mix of so many things. The feathers represent the peace, and the helmet represents the war. It&#x27;s like where we are right now. There&#x27;s a lot of war, that people can&#x27;t necessarily explain. The economy sucks, girls are still beautiful. We wanted to make music that reflected that. So people can look back twenty years from now, and say &#x27;this is what was going on&#x27;&quot;. They then announced in the interview that the next two singles would be &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen the Light&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize U&quot;. Williams described &quot;Hypnotize U&quot; as being &quot;so different from the rest of the album&quot;, stating he was &quot;very pleased because it serves a different purpose&quot; in the album. On October 17, 2010, the standard edition and the deluxe edition of the album became available for pre-order on iTunes. It was later announced that they would support Gorillaz on the North American leg of their 2010 Escape to Plastic Beach Tour. In 2013, Williams confirmed an N.E.R.D. album was in progress, but also mentioned that the album would not be released that year due to the projects he was working on with other artists. He has also said the album will be &quot;nature-based&quot;. The group reunited on December 26, 2014, to release the songs &quot;Squeeze Me&quot;, &quot;Patrick Star&quot;, and &quot;Sandy Squirrel&quot; for the film &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;.

N.E.R.D.&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;No One Ever Really Dies&quot;, was released on December 15, 2017, through I Am Other and Columbia Records. It features guest appearances from André 3000, M.I.A., Gucci Mane, Wale, and Ed Sheeran among others. It was preceded by three singles; &quot;Lemon&quot; with Rihanna (on November 1), &quot;1000&quot; with Future (on November 29), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Do It!&quot; with Kendrick Lamar (on December 13).

The group did shows throughout 2018 such as the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They also released a popular remix to &quot;Lemon&quot; with Drake.

In 2024, Hugo filed a legal action against Williams.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s sound generally contains elements of rock, funk and hip-hop, while also encompassing R&amp;B and pop. Their sound has also been described as featuring funk rock, alternative hip-hop, rap rock, experimental hip-hop, avant-funk, and progressive pop. They have been praised for their heavy use of electronic, bass and funk beats, while others have suggested that the Neptunes are unable to blend R&amp;B and rock.

N.E.R.D.&#x27;s lyrics have been criticized. Ian Cohen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the band&#x27;s lyrical writing ability &quot;far down the list of what N.E.R.D is actually good at&quot;, where Williams is often criticized for being excessively sexual. With the release of &quot;Fly or Die&quot;, the album was advertised in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, which made Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; feel that N.E.R.D.&#x27;s lyrics tried to &quot;empathize with the alienated teenagers who make up &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s readership&quot;.

<doc id="420974" wikidata="Q1509765" url="?curid=420974" title="Kentucky Colonels">
<text>The Kentucky Colonels were a member of the American Basketball Association (ABA) for all of the league&#x27;s nine years. The name is derived from the historic Kentucky Colonels. The Colonels won the most games and had the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the league&#x27;s history, but the team did not join the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the 1976 ABA–NBA merger. The downtown Louisville Convention Center (now known as The Gardens) was the Colonels&#x27; venue for their first three seasons before moving to Freedom Hall for the remaining seasons, beginning with the 1970–71 schedule.

The Kentucky Colonels were only one of two ABA teams, along with the Indiana Pacers, to play for the entire duration of the league without relocating, changing its team name, or folding. The Colonels were also the only major league franchise in Kentucky since the Louisville Breckenridges left the National Football League in 1923.

==Overview and background==
The Louisville-based Colonels started their time in the ABA as a colorful franchise, and not just because of their bright chartreuse green uniforms. Among the things they were known for was their &quot;mascot&quot; Ziggy, a prize-winning Brussels Griffon dog that was owned by original team owners Joe and Mamie Gregory.

They were equally famous for publicity stunts, their most famous coming in 1968 when Penny Ann Early, the first licensed female horse racing jockey, was signed to appear in an ABA game (albeit for a few seconds).

The early color of their franchise began to wane during the 1970–71 season, when they signed another Wildcat star in All-American Dan Issel. They also dropped the chartreuse green uniforms in favor of a blue and white scheme similar to that of the Wildcats. Another abnormality to the Colonels uniform change was that the players&#x27; last names on the back had only the first letter capitalized, as opposed to all capital letters, which are almost universally featured on the back of nearly every professional or collegiate basketball uniform where names are featured on the back. Issel&#x27;s signing helped the Colonels become well known as a legitimate basketball team. Despite an average record in the regular season, they made a serious run at the 1971 ABA championship. They fell just short, however, and lost to the Utah Stars in seven games.

They proved to be even better in 1971, with the signing of Artis Gilmore. Gilmore&#x27;s signing would help make the Colonels a legitimate powerhouse for years to come. The Colonels won 68 games in his rookie campaign under coach Joe Mullaney; their record turned out to be best in the league&#x27;s entire history. Yet, in the playoffs, they were upset by the New York Nets in the first round. Kentucky recovered and made another championship run during the 1972–73 playoffs, but lost a physical series to the Indiana Pacers in 7 games, 4 games to 3.

After the season, the franchise was nearly moved out-of-state to Cincinnati, but was purchased by John Y. Brown, Jr., a future Kentucky governor who owned Kentucky Fried Chicken for years. Brown helped increase interest in the team, and looked to improve its on-court performance by hiring popular ABA coach Babe McCarthy. But after they were swept in the second round of the playoffs by the Nets, Brown gave McCarthy his walking papers.

For the 1974–75 season, Brown hired Hubie Brown (no relation), a former NBA assistant coach, to give them that championship. Unlike the past year, the Colonels would not be denied. After a torrid finish to the regular season, which saw them win 23 of 26 games, they ripped through the playoffs, and beat their nemesis, the Indiana Pacers, in a dominant 4 games to 1 victory to win the 1975 ABA championship. Gilmore scored 28 points and grabbed an amazing 31 rebounds in the final game. That same season the Golden State Warriors won the NBA Title. Colonels owner, John Y. Brown, offered the NBA Champs a million dollars to play a one-game world championship. The Warriors and the NBA refused.

The celebration of the 1975 season ended when John Y. Brown, Jr. dealt Dan Issel to the ABA&#x27;s new Baltimore Claws franchise (which folded after a few preseason exhibition games, never taking the floor in the regular season) for financial reasons. They acquired all-star Caldwell Jones to replace him, but he never gelled with the team. Jones was dealt mid-season for young Maurice Lucas. Hubie managed to make the team competitive, but they lost in the postseason to the Denver Nuggets in 7 games.

Kentucky was one of the league&#x27;s strongest teams both on and off the court. It boasted a talented roster and had one of its best fan bases. However, during merger talks with the NBA, the older league&#x27;s Chicago Bulls objected to the Colonels being part of the merger. They owned the NBA rights to Artis Gilmore, and desperately wanted him on their roster, even at the expense of accepting the geographically much closer Pacers in their place. As a result, John Y. Brown, Jr. was forced to fold the Colonels. Brown would indeed get an NBA franchise: he purchased the Buffalo Braves in 1976, then traded it for the Boston Celtics two years later.

Colonels players were distributed to other teams in a dispersal draft, with Gilmore going to Chicago. Maurice Lucas went on to be an all-star for the Portland Trail Blazers and Louie Dampier, who ended up being the all-time leader in points and assists, ended his career as a sixth man for the San Antonio Spurs. Coach Hubie Brown went on to coach the Atlanta Hawks for five seasons after the merger before being fired.

The Colonels won 448 games in the ABA, more than any other team or franchise. The Colonels&#x27; overall regular season record was 448–296; their .602 winning percentage is better than that of any ABA franchise except for the Minnesota Muskies who only played one season. (If the Utah Stars&#x27; statistics are counted on their own, excluding their seasons as the Anaheim Amigos and the Los Angeles Stars, that team&#x27;s winning percentage, .608, is slightly better than the Colonels&#x27;.The Colonels&#x27; winning percentage during the Utah Stars ABA existence was 65%.)

The Colonels&#x27; playoff record was 55–46 (.545). Only the Indiana Pacers won more ABA playoff games (69).

===1967–1968===
On March 6, 1967, the American Basketball Association awarded the franchise that became the Kentucky Colonels to Don Regan for $30,000. Later that year the franchise was bought by Joseph Gregory, Mamie Gregory and William C. Boone.

John Givens was named as the first coach of the Colonels.

The Colonels draft picks were used on UK standout Louie Dampier, who signed with the Colonels; Western Kentucky University standout Clem Haskins, who signed with the NBA&#x27;s Chicago Bulls; Bob Verga, who signed with Dallas, and Randy Mahaffey, who signed with the Colonels. The team also signed Darel Carrier (WKU) and Jim &quot;Goose&quot; Ligon (from Kokomo, Indiana). The Colonels&#x27; 1967–68 roster was rounded out with Kendall Rhine (Rice University), Stew Johnson (Murray State), Rubin Russell, Bill Bradley (Tennessee Tech), Cotton Nash (UK), Bobby Rascoe (WKU), Howard Bayne (Tennessee), Orbie Bowling (Tennessee) and Tommy Woods.

The Colonels played their home games at the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center (Freedom Hall) and at the Louisville Convention Center (now Louisville Gardens). The team only won 5 of their first 17 games, leading to Givens being fired as coach. He was replaced by Gene Rhodes. In November, Stew Johnson was traded to the New Jersey Americans for Jim Caldwell. Darel Carrier, Randy Mahaffey and Louie Dampier played in the ABA All Star game but the team finished with a record of 36 wins and 42 losses, tying New Jersey for fourth place in the Eastern Division. For the season the Colonels averaged 3,225 fans per game.

The Colonels and Americans scheduled a one-game playoff game to determine who would get the playoff bid slated for the Eastern Division&#x27;s fourth place team. The game was scheduled at the Long Island Arena, as New Jersey&#x27;s Teaneck Armory was unavailable, but the facility was in such poor condition that the game could not be played, and the Colonels won by forfeit. The Colonels then advanced to the Eastern Division semifinals where they lost to the Minnesota Muskies 3 games to 2.

===1968–1969===
Among the Colonels&#x27; draft picks was University of Louisville star Wes Unseld, who opted to take a higher paying deal with the NBA&#x27;s Baltimore franchise. The Colonels also drafted Manny Leaks and Gene Moore, who signed with the team. Sam Smith was acquired from Minnesota and then Randy Mahaffey and Manny Leaks were traded to the New York Nets for Oliver Darden and Andy Anderson.

The Colonels hosted the 1969 ABA All-Star Game in Louisville. Kentucky coach Gene Rhodes was the head coach for the East team, which lost to the West 133–127. Darel Carrier and Louie Dampier repeated as ABA All Stars and were joined by Kentucky&#x27;s Jim &quot;Goose&quot; Ligon.

During this season the Colonels fielded the first ever female professional basketball player when jockey Penny Ann Early joined the team for pregame warmups and appeared briefly during a game.

The Colonels finished in third place in the Eastern Division with a 42–36 record. Their average home attendance was 4,157.

In the Eastern Division semifinals the Colonels lost a tight series to their rival the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 3.

===1969–1970===
The Colonels used their draft picks to select Bob Dandridge, who joined the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA and Herm Gilliam, who signed with the NBA&#x27;s Cincinnati franchise. Bud Olsen, former Kentucky Wesleyan College star George Tinsley, future Kentucky Wesleyan coach Wayne Chapman and former University of Kentucky star Tommy Kron were added to the roster.

In April 1969 the Colonels were bought by a group of Louisville investors that included H. Wendell Cherry, Bill DeWitt, J. David Grissom, Stuart P. Jay, David A. Jones, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Mike Storen. Storen had previously been the president and general manager of the Indiana Pacers. The group then hired former University of Kentucky star Alex Groza as the team&#x27;s business manager.

Darel Carrier and Louie Dampier again appeared in the ABA All Star Game and were joined by Gene Moore.

The Colonels finished the season with a record of 45–39 which was good for second place in the Eastern Division.

The Colonels defeated the New York Nets 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division semifinals but lost in the Eastern Division finals to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 1.

===1970–1971===

In July the Colonels traded Jim &quot;Goose&quot; Ligon, Gene Moore and Bud Olsen to Dallas for Cincy Powell. They also signed University of Kentucky star Dan Issel. Issel was given a 10-year contract worth $1.4 million. The Colonels also traded a draft pick to the New York Nets for Walt Simon. Mike Pratt joined the Colonels&#x27; roster for the season.

The Colonels began the regular season with a 10–5 record, resulting in coach Gene Rhodes being fired. Rhodes was briefly replaced by Alex Groza, who won both games he coached. Groza was quickly replaced as coach by Frank Ramsey, the former star for the University of Kentucky and the Boston Celtics.

Kentucky&#x27;s Dan Issel and Cincy Powell played in the ABA All-Star Game. Issel was named Co-Rookie of the Year, along with Charlie Scott of the Virginia Squires.

The Colonels finished the regular season with a record of 44–40 and in second place in the Eastern Division. Their average home attendance for the season was 7,375. Beginning with this season the Colonels moved their home games from the Louisville Convention Center (now Louisville Gardens) to Freedom Hall.

The Colonels defeated The Floridians 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division semifinals and defeated the Virginia Squires 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division finals. Facing the Utah Stars in the ABA championship, the Colonels and Stars each won three games before Utah pulled out Game 7 at home in front of an ABA record crowd. The Colonels finished as the league&#x27;s runner up.

===1971–1972===
The Colonels&#x27; draft picks included Artis Gilmore, John Roche and Mike Gale, who all signed with Kentucky, and Fred Brown and Larry Steele, who signed with the Seattle SuperSonics and Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA, respectively. The Colonels then sold Roche to the New York Nets. Gilmore, like Issel, signed a contract for 10 years and $1.5 million. Joe Mullaney was named coach of the Colonels.

On September 22, 1971, the Colonels played in the second ever ABA vs. NBA preseason exhibition game. 13,821 fans watched the Colonels defeat the Baltimore Bullets 111–85 in Freedom Hall. It was the ABA&#x27;s first win against the NBA, as the ABA&#x27;s Dallas Chaparrals had lost to the NBA&#x27;s Milwaukee Bucks 106–103 the night before in the first ever matchup between the two leagues.

On October 8, 1971, the Colonels hosted the Milwaukee Bucks and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at Freedom Hall in front of over 18,000 fans. Dan Issel scored 34 points and Artis Gilmore posted 18 points, 16 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. However, Abdul-Jabbar had 30 points, 20 rebounds and 3 blocked shots and the Bucks edged the Colonels, 99–93. The very next night the Colonels hosted the New York Knicks in Freedom Hall. The Knicks won, 112–100, before 12,238 fans.

The Colonels had a terrific regular season. Mullaney coached in the ABA All Star Game, heading up the East team which won 142–115. Dan Issel, Louie Dampier and Artis Gilmore each played in the All Star Game for the East team; Issel was the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Gilmore ended up as the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player at the end of the season and was also the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. Gilmore&#x27;s impressive statistics included leading the league with 3,666 minutes in play, a field goal percentage of 59.8% and an average of 17.8 rebounds per game. Gilmore and Issel were both on the All-ABA First Team.

Kentucky finished the season with the best record ever posted in ABA play, with 68 wins and 16 losses, a winning percentage of .810. This secured the Colonels&#x27; first ever first-place finish in the Eastern Division. The Colonels&#x27; average home attendance was 8,811.

Kentucky&#x27;s remarkable season came to a surprising end when the Colonels lost in the Eastern Division semifinals to the New York Nets, 4 games to 2.

===1972–1973===
Prior to the season the Colonels traded Cincy Powell to the Utah Stars for a draft pick and cash, and bought Rick Mount from the Indiana Pacers for $250,000. Wendell Ladner joined the Colonels&#x27; roster for the season.

In preseason play, on September 23, 1972, the Colonels hosted the NBA&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks for an exhibition game in Frankfort. Julius Erving played for the Hawks, posting 28 points and 18 rebounds in 42 minutes. The Hawks prevailed, 112–99. On September 30, 1972, the Colonels traveled to Phoenix, Arizona for an exhibition game against the Phoenix Suns. The Colonels won, 120–118. On October 1, 1972, the Milwaukee Bucks returned to Freedom Hall. Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar each scored 20 points as the Bucks beat the Colonels 131–100. On October 6, 1972, the Phoenix Suns played the Colonels at Freedom Hall. The Suns won, 103–91. The next night the Colonels lost a close game to the Baltimore Bullets, 95–93.

Louie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore returned to the ABA All-Star Game. Gilmore was again First Team All-ABA and posted a 55.9% field goal percentage and averaged 17.6 rebounds per game. Issel led the league in minutes played with 3,531.

The Colonels finished in second place in the Eastern Division with a record of 56 wins and 28 losses. Their average home attendance was 7,113.

The Colonels beat the Virginia Squires 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division Semifinals and beat the Carolina Cougars 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division finals. The Colonels then lost a very close ABA Championship Series to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 3.

===1973–1974===
Prior to the Colonels&#x27; 1973–74 season the Colonels drafted M. L. Carr and Ron Behagen; Carr stayed in college and Behagen signed with the NBA&#x27;s Kansas City-Omaha Kings. The Colonels also selected Ernie DiGregorio in a special circumstance draft but he signed with the NBA&#x27;s Buffalo Braves.

In July 1973 the franchise was bought by a group headed by John Y. Brown, Jr. and his wife Ellie Brown. Ellie Brown was later named Chairman of the Board of the team; the board itself was made up of ten women. Legendary former University of Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp was named as Vice President of the Board. Mike Storen left the team; he later surfaced with the ABA&#x27;s Memphis franchise. Former head coach Gene Rhodes became general manager of the team.

Head coach Joe Mullaney departed to become head coach of the Utah Stars. Mullaney was succeeded by Babe McCarthy.

In preseason play against the NBA the Colonels defeated the Houston Rockets 110–102 at Freedom Hall on September 21, 1973, and defeated the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 110–99 the following night.

In January 1974 the Colonels traded Jim O&#x27;Brien and a first round draft pick to the San Diego Conquistadors for Red Robbins and Chuck Williams. That same month Kentucky dealt Rick Mount to the Utah Stars for a draft pick and cash, and then sent Mike Gale and Wendell Ladner to the New York Nets for former Colonel John Roche.

Louie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore again played in the ABA All-Star Game, and Babe McCarthy coached the East team. Gilmore was again named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Gilmore again posted remarkable statistics including 3,502 minutes played (tops in the league) and 18.3 rebounds per game (Gilmore grabbed 40 rebounds in one game against the New York Nets that season). Louie Dampier posted a league high 38.7% percentage in three-point shots. Babe McCarthy and his Colonels predecessor Joe Mullaney were named ABA Co-Coaches of the Year.

The Colonels posted a regular season record of 53 wins and 31 losses, clinching second place in the Eastern Division. Kentucky&#x27;s average home attendance for the season was 8,201.

In the playoffs Kentucky defeated the Carolina Cougars 4 games to none in the Eastern Division semifinals but then lost the Eastern Division finals to the New York Nets 4 games to none. Despite being named ABA Coach of the Year, Babe McCarthy was fired at the end of the season.

===1974–1975===
The Colonels took Jim Price, Greg Smith, Rowland Garrett, Herm Gilliam and Larry Steele in a draft of NBA players, bought Ted McClain from the Carolina Cougars, signed Wil Jones, and traded a draft pick and cash to the San Antonio Spurs for Bird Averitt. The Colonels also sent Al Eberhard to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Marv Roberts and sent Red Robbins to the Virginia Squires for cash. John Roche was sold to the Utah Stars in the midst of the season. Gene Littles was added to the Colonels roster for the season.

Hubie Brown was named the new head coach of the Colonels.

In preseason play against the NBA the Colonels lost a game in Lincoln, Nebraska to the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 102–91 on September 29, 1974; beat the Washington Bullets 118–95 at Freedom Hall on October 1, 1974; lost by one point on the road to the Houston Rockets on October 5, 1974, 96–95; beat the Detroit Pistons 109–100 at Freedom Hall on October 8, 1974, and on October 12, 1974, defeated the Chicago Bulls at Freedom Hall 93–75.

Louie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore again played in the ABA All Star Game. Gilmore again was First Team All ABA and led the league with 3,493 minutes played.

The Colonels claimed first place in the Eastern Division with a record of 58 wins and 26 losses, but tied with the New York Nets for the division crown. The Colonels&#x27; average home attendance was 8,727.

The Colonels began the playoffs with a one-game matchup against the New York Nets to determine who would be first place in the Eastern Division. The Colonels won that game in Louisville 108–99. The Colonels then defeated the Memphis Sounds 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division semifinals and defeated the Spirits of St. Louis 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division finals. The Colonels met their rivals the Indiana Pacers for the ABA Championship and the Colonels prevailed, 4 games to 1, winning their first ABA Championship.

Colonels owner John Y. Brown offered $1 million to the NBA Champion Golden State Warriors to play a world title game. The NBA and Golden State refused. Many believe the Colonels were the better team. Hubie Brown went on to coach many teams in the NBA but has always maintained (including in his Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame induction) that the 1974–75 Colonels were the best team he coached.

===1975–1976===
Prior to the season the Colonels and the ABA&#x27;s commissioner, Dave DeBusschere, challenged the NBA to have its champion, the Golden State Warriors, face the Colonels in a championship series, the winner of which would get $1 million. The NBA declined. Interest in ABA vs. NBA play extended beyond the two leagues&#x27; management. In 1976, CBS sought to establish a postseason playoff between the ABA and NBA, and to win the rights to broadcast those games.

To the dismay of Colonels fans and players, owner John Y. Brown, Jr. dealt star Dan Issel to the Baltimore Claws prior to the season for $500,000; the cash was not forthcoming from the struggling Baltimore franchise and Issel ended up with the Denver Nuggets shortly before the Claws were shut down by the league.

Gene Rhodes was named vice president of operations and David Vance was named general manager for the team.

In preseason play the Colonels defeated the Chicago Bulls, 95–86, at Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati on October 1, 1975; lost to the New York Knicks in Landover, Maryland at the Capital Centre, 107–102, on October 4, 1975; defeated the Detroit Pistons 114–113 on October 5, 1975, in Cincinnati; defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 96–91 in Freedom Hall on October 10, 1975; lost an overtime game to the Detroit Pistons in Detroit on October 12, 1975, 115–107; defeated the Buffalo Braves, 120–116, in Freedom Hall on October 14, 1975; defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 112–110 in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 17, 1975; and won another ABA vs. NBA exhibition on October 19, 1975, with a 121–111 victory over the Washington Bullets in Lexington, Kentucky. The game against the Bullets was the penultimate ABA vs. NBA contest; two nights later in the final ABA vs. NBA matchup the Utah Stars defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 106–101.

The prior year, the NBA declined the ABA champion Colonels&#x27; challenge against the NBA champion Golden State Warriors for a $1 million payout. However, the two teams met on October 8, 1975, at Freedom Hall. The Colonels won the matchup of the league champions, 93–90.

The Colonels finished the 1975–76 preseason with a record of 7–2 against NBA teams. The Colonels, like the ABA as a whole, had a winning overall record against the NBA over the course of their existence.

Shortly after the regular season began the San Diego Sails folded and the Colonels picked up Caldwell Jones from their roster. Kentucky then traded Jones to the Spirits of St. Louis for Maurice Lucas. The Colonels also traded Marv Roberts to the Virginia Squires during the season in exchange for Johnny Neumann and Jan van Breda Kolff. Another move in the middle of the season sent Ted McClain to the New York Nets in exchange for $150,000. Allen Murphy, Jimmy Dan Connor, Johnny Neumann, Jimmy Baker, Kevin Joyce and Jim McDaniels joined the Colonels&#x27; roster for the 1975–76 season.

Artis Gilmore returned to the ABA All-Star Game and once again was named First Team All ABA. Dampier, after seven appearances in that game, was not chosen.

The Colonels finished in fourth place in the regular season with a record of 46–38. Their average home attendance was 6,935.

The Colonels defeated their rivals, the Indiana Pacers, 2 games to 1 in the first round of the playoffs. In the league semifinals, the Colonels and the Denver Nuggets each won three games apiece before Denver claimed Game 7 133–110 at Denver on April 28, 1976. It was the Kentucky Colonels&#x27; final game.

===Aftermath===
The ABA had entered the 1975–1976 preseason with ten teams. After three preseason games, the Baltimore Claws were shut down by the league due to financial problems and unpaid bills. The San Diego Sails and the Utah Stars each folded shortly after the season began, the Sails after 11 games and the Stars after 16. The ABA was reduced to seven teams for the remainder of the season. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Virginia Squires were forced to fold because they could not meet a league-mandated financial assessment. The six remaining ABA teams began negotiations for the eventual ABA–NBA merger. According to Jim Bukata of the ABA, the NBA opposed Kentucky joining the league, and Bill Wirtz of the Chicago Bulls opposed Kentucky joining because Chicago wanted to acquire Kentucky&#x27;s Artis Gilmore in a dispersal draft. In the end, the Colonels were not among the four teams the NBA agreed to take in.

On July 17, 1976, the Kentucky Colonels ceased to exist as John Y. Brown, Jr. agreed to fold the Colonels in exchange for $3 million. Brown used the money to purchase the Buffalo Braves of the NBA, bringing Colonels head coach Joe Mullaney and point guard Bird Averitt with him to Buffalo. The Braves are now known as the Los Angeles Clippers.

The Colonels players were put into a dispersal draft. The Chicago Bulls took Artis Gilmore for $1.1 million as they had wished. The Portland Trail Blazers took Maurice Lucas for $300,000. The Buffalo Braves took Bird Averitt for $125,000. The Indiana Pacers took Wil Jones for $50,000. The New York Nets took Jan Van Breda Kolff for $60,000. The San Antonio Spurs took Louie Dampier for $20,000.

In contrast to Brown receiving $3 million in cash for the Colonels, the Spirits of St. Louis&#x27; owners received $2.2 million in cash along with a 1/7 share of each of the four remaining teams&#x27; television income in perpetuity. That deal netted the Spirits ownership about $300 million until 2014, then the league decided to buy out most of the deal for $500 million.

==Broadcast media==
Colonels games were broadcast throughout their history on WHAS Radio, the Louisville market&#x27;s top-rated station at the time and a 50,000-watt clear-channel station, which meant that Colonels broadcasts could be heard over much of the continental United States at night. Van Vance was the play-by-play announcer for nearly all of the games in the franchise&#x27;s history, with Cawood Ledford (better known as the longtime voice of the University of Kentucky Wildcats) behind the microphone as well, sometimes as color analyst beside Vance.

The Colonels had some games broadcast on various local television stations, but were usually only seen on TV during the ABA network games.

==New ABA, New Kentucky Colonels==
In 2004, the ABA 2000 brought Louisville a new team with the same name, the Kentucky Colonels.

<text>Hans Kammler (26 August 1901 – after October 1945) was an SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; responsible for Nazi civil engineering projects and its top secret V-weapons program. He oversaw the construction of various Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz, before being put in charge of the V-2 rocket and Emergency Fighter Programs towards the end of World War II. Kammler disappeared in May 1945 during the final days of the war, although conjecture about his capture or death remain a subject of debate.

==Early life==
Kammler was born in Stettin, German Empire (now Szczecin, Poland). In 1919, after volunteering for army service, he served in the Rossbach &quot;Freikorps&quot;. From 1919 to 1923, he studied civil engineering at the Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig and Munich and was awarded his doctorate of engineering (Dr. Ing.) in November 1932, following some years of practical work in local building administration.

==Nazi activist==
In 1931, Kammler joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP), where he held a variety of administrative positions after the Nazi government came to national power in 1933. Initially he was head of the Aviation Ministry&#x27;s building department. He joined the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) on 20 May 1933. In 1934, he was serving the Reich&#x27;s Ministry as the leader of the &quot;Reichsbund der Kleingärtner und Kleinsiedler&quot; (Reich&#x27;s federation of allotment gardeners and small home owners). 

Committed to the Nazi cause, engineers like Kammler &quot;saw no contradiction between notions of blood and soil and the methods of modern organization and technology.&quot; Historian Michael Thad Allen argues that Kammler wanted to place &quot;the best means of modern organization&quot; at the Nazis&#x27; disposal since he believed that National Socialism was a &quot;necessary catalyst&quot; for modern construction. For Kammler, the concepts of &quot;modern technology, organization, and ideologies of German supremacy&quot; were all interwoven.

==Concentration camps and the Holocaust==
Before joining Oswald Pohl&#x27;s organization at the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (WVHA), Kammler had already been advising the SS Race and Settlement Main Office as a consultant. In June 1941, he joined the Waffen-SS. Due to Himmler&#x27;s desire to increase the pace and scale of SS construction activities, Kammler was released as an adviser to the Reichskommissariat for the Reinforcement of Germandom, so his technical and managerial competencies could be exploited. In the person of Kammler, Allen writes, &quot;technological competence and extreme Nazi fanaticism coexisted in the same man.&quot; Even Albert Speer—Adolf Hitler&#x27;s chief architect—came to fear Kammler and placed him among &quot;Himmler&#x27;s most brutal and most ruthless henchmen.&quot; Kammler was known to scrutinize the education of his subordinates as well as their ideological commitment to National Socialism, which he factored into their duty assignments and promotions.

Immediately after being assigned to the WVHA, Kammler became Pohl&#x27;s deputy, where he worked with SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Richard Glücks of Office D (Concentration Camps Inspectorate), and was also named Chief of Office C, which designed and constructed all the concentration and extermination camps. On 26 September 1941—just days after the announcement of the plan for Majdanek—Kammler ordered the construction of the largest of the camps at Auschwitz. On 19 December 1941, Kammler updated Himmler about the slow progress at both Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek, remarking that construction was delayed due to the freezing weather, lack of materials, and insufficient manpower. By late March 1942, the systematic mass deportation of Jews to Auschwitz had begun.

Historian Nikolaus Wachsmann states that Kammler &quot;was intimately involved in all the major building projects in Auschwitz.&quot; For instance, in his capacity within the WVHA, Kammler oversaw the installation of more efficient cremation facilities at Auschwitz-Birkenau, when the Nazis converted it into an extermination camp. Under Kammler&#x27;s supervision, new crematoria were planned during August 1942 at Birkenau to facilitate burning up to one-hundred twenty thousand corpses per month.

Kammler&#x27;s construction unit &quot;Amtsgruppe&quot; C was involved in the razing of the Warsaw Ghetto from April 1943 onwards.

==Secret weapons projects==

After the RAF successfully bombed the rocket production facilities at Peenemünde during August 1943, Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer recommended transferring the V-2 rocket production underground. Hitler immediately agreed with Speer, and the two decided that the SS, with its massive supply of slave labor, was best suited for this task. As the SS construction chief, Kammler was selected to oversee the project—along with representatives Gerhard Degenkolb and Karl Maria Hettlage from Speer&#x27;s ministry—which began at a huge fuel storage facility in Thuringia as Mittelwerk GmbH.

By the end of August 1943, Kammler had a sizable detachment of concentration camp inmates from Buchenwald working at the new underground installation, and before the year was out there were so many slave laborers that another facility (Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp) had to be established. The secret weapons projects for which Kammler was given responsibility included manufacturing both the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the V-2, which Kammler—in a construction effort of ruthless brutality and speed—had in production before the end of 1943. The tunnels and weapons were built in horrendous conditions by the slave laborers from Mittelbau-Dora. Research has found that of the 60,000 people that passed through Mittelbau-Dora camp, an estimated 10,000 died producing the V2 alone, which is double the estimated 5,000 killed by the weapon system in Britain and Belgium combined. More than 20,000 died at Mittelbau-Dora in total throughout the camp&#x27;s existence. Kammler&#x27;s attitude towards the prisoners was utter indifference, having once exclaimed, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about the victims. The work must proceed ahead in the shortest time possible&quot;.
Due to the combination of his building experts, access to slave labor, and connections to SS facilities, Kammler became an &quot;indispensable figure&quot; in the armaments efforts of the SS, so much so, that he was only answerable to Himmler. Speer made Kammler his representative for &quot;special construction tasks&quot;, expecting that Kammler would commit himself to working in harmony with the ministry&#x27;s main construction committee. But in March 1944 Kammler had Göring appoint him as his delegate for &quot;special buildings&quot; under the fighter aircraft program, which made him one of the war economy&#x27;s most important managers. In April 1944, Hitler gave Kammler full control over jet-aircraft production.

In March 1944, Himmler convinced Hitler to put the V-2 project directly under SS control. On 8 August Kammler replaced Walter Dornberger as its director taking command and control of V-2 operations. The first rockets were launched from a site near The Hague against London on 8 September 1944. Kammler was also involved in an attempt to finish the Blockhaus d&#x27;Éperlecques near Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais in Northern France. The fortified bunker was to be used as a V-2 launch base but it was abandoned in September 1944 before it could be finished. On 31 January 1945, Hitler named Kammler head of all missile projects, but by this time the lack of explosives was critical and the program was winding down. By this time, Kammler answered only to Hitler. 

In March 1945, Hitler stripped Göring of his powers over aircraft support, maintenance and supply, and transferred these duties to Kammler. This culminated, in the beginning of April, with Kammler being raised to &quot;Fuehrer&#x27;s general plenipotentiary for jet aircraft&quot;. 

===Arnsberg Forest Massacre===
In late March 1945, Kammler, ordered the ZV division (in German) (units that operated the V-2 rockets) to execute forced laborers and their families (200 men, women, and children) after his car was held up on a crowded road in the Sauerland. Kammler allegedly felt he was under some &quot;vague threat&quot; from them, so he had them murdered. The killings coincided with the evacuation of V2 units due to the Allied advance into Germany.

==Disappearance and fate==
On 1 April 1945, Kammler ordered the evacuation of 500 missile technicians to the Nazis&#x27; Alpine Fortress. Since the last V-2 on the western front had been launched in late March, on 5 April Kammler was charged by the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; to command the defense of the Nordhausen area, where Mittelwerk was located. However, rather than defend the missile construction works, he immediately ordered the destruction of all the &quot;special V-1 equipment&quot; at the Syke storage site.

In the final weeks of the war in Europe, Kammler&#x27;s movements became sketchy and contradictory. Further evidence of Kammler&#x27;s activities consists of a telegram sent from Kammler to Speer, Himmler, and Göring on 16 April, informing them of the creation of a &quot;message centre&quot; at Munich and the appointment of an operations chief for the construction of the Messerschmitt Me 262. On 20 April, he reportedly arrived with a group of technicians at Himmler’s &quot;Kommandostelle&quot; near Salzburg. 

On 22 April he caught up with Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger, both of whom were reported to have made contact with the Allies, in Oberammergau, Bavaria. He failed to agree on a joint course of action with them. 
A wartime diary, relating to the surrender of the mountain resort town Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Allied troops, reports the arrival of Kammler and some 600 staff in a motorised column carrying &quot;high-quality research material&quot; in Oberammergau on 22 April 1945. According to this source, he came into conflict with the local commander, lieutenant Burger, over failing to seek permission to establish his quarters in the area. In Oberammergau, Kammler initially stayed in the hotel of Alois Lang, which he had commandeered for indefinite use on 9 February 1945, and then moved quarters to the Linderhof Palace in nearby Ettal. On 23 April, Kammler sent a radio message to his office manager at Berlin, ordering him to organize the immediate destruction of the &quot;V-1 equipment near Berlin&quot; and then to go to Munich. On 27 April, American tanks were reported in Schongau, 35 km to the northwest of Oberammergau. On the morning of 28 April, anticipating their entry into Oberammergau that day, Kammler left the town with his staff. 

His next stop, in late April/early May, was at the &quot;Villa Mendelssohn&quot;, the headquarters of SS Special Inspection IV, in Ebensee, some 270 km to the east of Oberammergau. Ebensee was the site of a concentration camp and arms factory overseen by him and part of the half-mythical Alpine Fortress complex. On the early morning of 4 May, he ordered the immediate transfer of the Ebensee office to Prague, apparently denounced by his subordinates as a suicide mission.

He drove in the direction of Linz (100 km from Ebensee), captured by the American troops on 5 May, and became separated from others in his convoy, including Karl Saur. On 6 May, he was alleged by Gottlob Berger, head of the SS Main Office, to have met with him in Kirchdorf in Tirol, almost 200 km west of Ebensee. On 7 May, British intelligence intercepted a message signed by Kammler asking the SS unit at the Leitmeritz concentration camp, a suspected V-3 production site, to report the arrival of his staff there. It is unclear whether he might have sent it after his capture. 

Kammler then went missing. On 2 November 1945, however, Brigadier General George Clement McDonald (1892-1969), the director of intelligence of the US Air Forces in Europe, acting under the authority of the Air Force Intelligence Service chief in Washington, DC, commissioned the interrogation of Kammler to chief investigator Ernst Englander, indicating particular interest in German underground installations. This is understood as evidence that Kammler was by then still alive and in US custody.

=== Testimonies by other Nazis ===
In a sworn statement on 16 October 1959, Kammler&#x27;s driver, Kurt Preuk, stated that Kammler&#x27;s date of death was &quot;about 10 May 1945&quot;, but that he did not know the cause of death. On 7 September 1965, Heinz Zeuner (a wartime aide of Kammler&#x27;s), stated that Kammler had died on 7 May 1945 and that his corpse had been observed by Zeuner, Preuk and others. All the eyewitnesses consulted were certain that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. In their accounts of Kammler&#x27;s movements, Preuk and Zeuner claimed that he left Linderhof near Oberammergau on 28 April 1945 for a tank conference at Salzburg and then went to Ebensee (where tank tracks were manufactured). According to Preuk and Zeuner, he then traveled back from Ebensee to visit his wife in the Tyrol region, when he gave her two cyanide capsules. The next day, 5 May, at around 4 am, he is said to have departed Tyrol for Prague. Both Preuk&#x27;s and Zeuner&#x27;s accounts are judged to be &quot;fictitious narratives that ... only served the purpose of obscuring the actual events and supporting the pension claims of Jutta Kammler for which her husband had to be officially declared deceased&quot;.

In a 1969 book, &quot;Wernher von Braun: Mein Leben für die Raumfahrt&quot;, journalist claimed Kammler arrived in Prague by aircraft on 4 May 1945, following which, he and 21 SS men defended a bunker against an attack by more than 500 Czech resistance fighters on 9 May. During the attack, one of Kammler&#x27;s aides-de-camp shot Kammler to prevent his capture. This version can reportedly be traced to Walter Dornberger, who claimed to have heard it from eyewitnesses.

===Official verdict===
On 9 July 1945, Kammler&#x27;s wife petitioned to have him declared dead as of 9 May 1945. She provided a statement by Kammler&#x27;s driver, Kurt Preuk, according to which Preuk had personally seen &quot;the corpse of Kammler and been present at his burial&quot; on 9 May 1945. The District Court of Berlin-Charlottenburg ruled on 7 September 1948 that his death was officially established as 9 May 1945.

Both Preuk and Zeuner maintained their version of events when interviewed in the 1990s. Some support for this version of events came from letters written by Ingeborg Alix Prinzessin zu Schaumburg-Lippe, a female member of the &quot;SS-Helferinnenkorps&quot;, to Kammler’s wife in 1951 and 1955. In these, she affirmed that Kammler had said goodbye to her on 7 May 1945 in Prague, stating that the Americans were after him, had made him offers but that he had refused and that they would not &quot;get him alive&quot;.

== Post-war searches ==
US occupation forces conducted various inquiries into Kammler’s whereabouts, beginning with the headquarters of 12th Army ordering a complete inventory of all personnel involved in missile production on 21 May 1945. This resulted in the creation of a file for Kammler, stating that he was possibly in Munich. The CIC noted that he had been seen shortly prior to the arrival of US troops in Oberjoch.

The Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee (CIOS) in London ordered a search for him in early July 1945. Members of the 12th Army replied that he was last seen on 8 or 9 April in the Harz region. In August, Kammler&#x27;s name made &quot;List 13&quot; of the UN for Nazi war criminals. Only in 1948 did the CIOS receive the information that Kammler reportedly fled to Prague and had committed suicide. Original blueprints of Kammler’s major projects were later found in the personal property of Samuel Goudsmit, the scientific leader of the Alsos Mission.

A CIC report from April 1946 listed Kammler among SS officers known to be outside Germany and considered to be of special interest to the CIC. In mid-July 1945, the head of the Gmunden CIC office, Major Morrisson, interviewed an unnamed German on the issue of a numbered account associated with construction sites for plane and missile production formerly run by the SS. A report published years later, in late 1947 or early 1948, stated that only Kammler and two other persons had access to the account. The report also said that &quot;shortly after the occupation, Hans Kammler appeared at CIC Gmunden and gave a statement on operations at Ebensee&quot;. The CIC notes on the interview give no name, but the interviewee must have been one of the three people with access to the account. Aside from Kammler, one was known to have left Austria in May 1945; the other was in a POW camp during July.

In 1949 a report written by one Oskar Packe on Kammler was filed by the US Denazification office in Hesse. The report stated that Kammler had been arrested by US troops on 9 May 1945 at the Messerschmitt works at Oberammergau. However, Kammler and some other senior SS personnel had managed to escape in the direction of Austria or Italy. Packe did not believe the reports about a suicide, as these were contradicted &quot;by the detailed information from the CIC&quot; about arrest and escape. 

Donald W. Richardson (1917–1997), a former OSS special agent involved in the Alsos Mission, claimed to be &quot;the man who brought Kammler to the US&quot;. Shortly before he died, Richardson reportedly told his sons about his experience during and after the war, including Operation Paperclip. According to them, Richardson claimed to have supervised Kammler until 1947. Kammler was supposedly &quot;interned at a place of maximum security, with no hope, no mercy and without seeing the light of day until he hanged himself&quot;. In 2019, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars published evidence that Kammler was indeed captured and interviewed by Americans during May 1945 in Germany; however, none of the evidence substantiated his stay and later suicide in the U.S., as Richardson claimed.

<text>The Subtle Knife is a young-adult fantasy novel published in 1997 and the second book in Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy. The novel continues the adventures of Lyra Belacqua (now known as Lyra Silvertongue) recounted in the first novel, &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, as she investigates the mysterious phenomenon of Dust. Will Parry is introduced as a companion to Lyra, and together they explore new worlds in the search for Will&#x27;s father.

From 2019 to 2020, the novel was adapted as the first and second series of the joint BBC-HBO television series &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, the former series additionally adapting &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.

==Setting==
The main setting is a universe dominated by the Magisterium, an international theocracy which actively suppresses heresy. In Lyra&#x27;s world, humans&#x27; souls naturally exist outside of their bodies in the form of sentient &quot;dæmons&quot; in animal form which accompany, aid, and comfort their humans. An important plot device is the alethiometer, a truth-telling symbol reader. By setting the alethiometer&#x27;s hands to point to symbols around a dial a skilled practitioner can pose questions, which are answered by the movement round the dial of a further hand. The Subtle Knife of the book&#x27;s title is a knife called Æsahættr, which can cut windows between worlds.

==Plot==
Twelve-year-old Will Parry lives in Oxford, where he cares for his mother who has mental health problems. After accidentally killing an intruder, Will flees and stumbles on a window to another world. Seeking refuge from his pursuers, he enters and finds himself in the city of Cittàgazze where he meets Lyra and her dæmon Pantalaimon, who have arrived from her world via the opening in the sky created by her father, Lord Asriel (in &quot;Northern Lights&quot;).

Mrs Coulter, Lyra&#x27;s mother, tortures a witch for a prophecy said to concern her daughter. Before the victim can reveal the details she is killed by the witch Serafina Pekkala. Realising Lyra&#x27;s importance, Serafina Pekkala sets off in search of her. Meanwhile the aeronaut Lee Scoresby searches for Stanislaus Grumman, previously believed dead, who is rumoured to have knowledge of a powerful object that could protect Lyra.

Will returns to his world to seek information about his father, who went missing years earlier on an expedition. Lyra, who has come with him, wants to learn about Dust—mysterious particles connected to consciousness. On the advice of her alethiometer Lyra visits the physicist Dr Mary Malone, who has a computer that can communicate with dark matter. Lyra realises that dark matter seems to correspond with what she knows as Dust.

After accepting a lift from an elderly man introducing himself as Sir Charles Latrom, Lyra realises he has stolen her alethiometer. Sir Charles promises to return the instrument in return for a powerful knife that he covets, now in Cittàgazze. Will defeats a youth who has taken the knife from its holder, Giacomo Paradisi, but loses two fingers in the fight. Paradisi explains that this is a sign that Will is the knife&#x27;s new bearer, and he explains its power: the ability to cut through any material, even the fabric between worlds. Will and Lyra learn that Cittàgazze is haunted by soul-eating spectres, which prey on adolescents and adults but ignore children.

Will uses the knife to cut a window into Sir Charles&#x27;s home where he overhears a conversation with Mrs Coulter. Lyra realises that Sir Charles is Lord Boreal, originally from her own world, and Will hears news of his father, who had disappeared after discovering a window between the worlds. Will and Lyra escape back to Cittàgazze with the alethiometer and are rescued from marauding children by Serafina Pekkala. She attempts unsuccessfully to heal Will&#x27;s injured hand.

Sir Charles visits Dr Malone and offers to fund her research if she will follow his directions. She refuses. At Lyra&#x27;s suggestion, she uses her computer to communicate with the consciousness of dark matter. It instructs her to destroy the computer and to travel through the same window between worlds used by Will and Lyra, explaining that her role is to &quot;play the serpent&quot;.

Lee Scoresby finds Grumman living as a shaman known to the people of that world as Jopari (a modified form of his English name John Parry): Will&#x27;s father. Grumman has summoned Scoresby to take him to the bearer of the knife and to assist Lord Asriel, who is assembling an army to rebel against an ancient angel called the Authority. They set off in Scoresby&#x27;s hot air balloon but are forced to land by soldiers of the Church. The soldiers attack, and Scoresby calls Serafina for help. She leaves Lyra to follow his call, but arrives too late. Scoresby has died holding off the soldiers so that Grumman can complete his task.

Mrs Coulter tricks Sir Charles into revealing the secret of the knife, and poisons him. She uses the spectres, which she has learned to control, to torture a witch into revealing the prophecy: that Lyra is the second Eve. Mrs Coulter plans to destroy her daughter rather than risk a second Fall.

Leaving Lyra asleep at their overnight camp, Will walks on alone and finds his father, who staunches his bleeding and tells him to join Lord Asriel&#x27;s forces. Grumman is killed by a vengeful witch whose love he had once spurned. Will returns to find a pair of angels waiting to guide him to Asriel. He goes to awaken Lyra, but finds that she is missing and that her guardian witches&#x27; souls have been drained by spectres.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; won Parents&#x27; Choice Gold Book Award; American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults; Booklist Editors&#x27; Choice; Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year; &quot;Horn Book&quot; Fanfare Honor Book; &quot;Bulletin&quot; Blue Ribbon Book; &quot;Book Links&quot; Best Book of the Year; and &quot;American Bookseller&quot; Pick of the Lists.

==Adaptations==
Before the release of &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, a film adaptation of the first book in the series, on 7 December 2007, New Line Cinema said that an adaptation of &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; would go into production only if the first film was a success. &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; made over twice its budget worldwide but was a disappointment in the United States, leaving the fate of its sequel unclear. The international rights were also originally sold to provide financing for the first film, thus amounting to a significant disappointment for New Line Cinema. Producer Deborah Forte, however, was adamant that she would finish the trilogy, saying, &quot;I believe there are enough people who see what a viable and successful franchise we have.&quot; However, Philip Pullman later remarked at the British Humanist Association annual conference in 2011 that due to the first film&#x27;s disappointing sales in the United States, there would not be any sequels made.

An audiobook adaptation, featuring a full cast and narration by the author, was released in 2000.

As the second novel of the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy, the book has also formed part of a radio drama on BBC Radio 4, starring Terence Stamp as Lord Asriel and Lulu Popplewell as Lyra, and as a two-part, six-hour performance for London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre in December 2003, running until March 2004, and starring Anna Maxwell Martin as Lyra, Dominic Cooper as Will, Timothy Dalton as Lord Asriel and Patricia Hodge as Mrs Coulter, and a second run between November 2004 and April 2005.

The second series of the joint BBC-HBO television adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, approved in September 2018, covers &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;, with introductions to the book&#x27;s central characters beginning in the first season.

<text>Wayne Lyman Morse (October 20, 1900 – July 22, 1974) was an American attorney and United States Senator from Oregon. Morse is well known for opposing the Democratic Party’s leadership and for his opposition to the Vietnam War on constitutional grounds.

Born in Madison, Wisconsin, and educated at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Minnesota Law School, Morse moved to Oregon in 1930 and began teaching at the University of Oregon School of Law. During World War II, he was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Republican; he became an Independent after Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1952. While an independent, he set a record for performing the third-longest one-person filibuster in the history of the Senate. Morse joined the Democratic Party in February 1955, and was reelected twice while a member of that party.

Morse made a brief run for the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1960. In 1964, Morse was one of two senators to oppose the later-to-become-controversial Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. It authorized the president to take military action in Vietnam without a declaration of war. He continued to speak out against the war in the ensuing years, and lost his 1968 bid for reelection to Bob Packwood, who criticized his strong opposition to the war. Morse made two more bids for reelection to the Senate before his death in 1974.

==Early life and career==
Morse was born on October 20, 1900, in Madison, Wisconsin, home of his maternal grandparents, Myron and Flora White. Morse&#x27;s parents, Wilbur F. Morse and Jessie Elnora Morse, farmed a plot near Verona, a small community west-southwest of Madison. Morse grew up on this farm, where the family raised Devon cattle for beef, Percheron and Hackney horses, dairy cows, hogs, sheep, poultry, and feed crops for the animals. The family eventually included five children: Mabel, seven years older than Morse; twin brothers Harry and Grant, four years older; Morse; and Caryl, fourteen years younger.

Encouraged by Jessie, the Morse family held relatively formal nightly discussions about crops, animals, education, religion, and most frequently about politics. Like many of their neighbors, the family was progressive and discussed ideas championed by Robert M. La Follette, Sr., a leader of the progressive movement who served as Wisconsin&#x27;s governor from 1900 to 1906 and thereafter as a member of the U.S. Senate. During these family discussions, Morse developed debating skills and strong opinions about political corruption, corporate domination, labor rights, women&#x27;s suffrage, education, and, on a personal level, hard work and sobriety.

Morse and his siblings began their education in a one-room school near Verona. However, the Morse parents, particularly Jessie, shared the Progressive belief that improvement of self and society came through good education, and they admired the schools in Madison. After Morse finished second grade, his parents enrolled him in Longfellow School in Madison, to which Morse commuted round-trip daily by riding relay on three of the family&#x27;s smaller horses. After eighth grade, Morse attended Madison High School, where he became class president and debating club president, and placed academically among the top 10 in his graduating class. In high school, he developed his relationship with Mildred &quot;Midge&quot; Downie, whom he had known since third grade, and who was class valedictorian and class vice-president the same year Morse was president.

Morse received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1923 and his master&#x27;s, in speech, from Wisconsin the next year. He married Downie in the same year. For several years, he taught speech at the University of Minnesota Law School, and earned his LLB degree there in 1928. He held a reserve commission as second lieutenant, Field Artillery, U.S. Army, from 1923 to 1929, and was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Morse became an assistant professor of law at the University of Oregon School of Law in 1929. Within nine months, he was promoted to associate professor and then dean of the law school. At age 31, this made him the youngest dean of any law school accredited by the American Bar Association.
After becoming a full professor of law in 1931, he completed his SJD (a research doctorate in law equivalent to the PhD) at Columbia Law School in 1932. He served on many government commissions and boards, including: member, Oregon Crime Commission; administrative director, United States Attorney General&#x27;s Survey of Release Procedures (1936–1939); Pacific Coast arbitrator for the United States Department of Labor (maritime industry) (1938–1942); chairman, Railway Emergency Board (1941); alternate public member of the National Defense Mediation Board (1941); and public member of the National War Labor Board (1942–1944).

==United States Senator==

=== 1944 election and first term ===
In 1944, Morse won the Republican primary election for senator, unseating incumbent Rufus C. Holman, and then the general election that November. To secure the support of the ultra-conservative wing of the Oregon Republicans in 1944, Morse had presented himself as being more right-wing than he really was, criticizing the New Deal in vitriolic terms though he also praised the wartime foreign policy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Once in Washington, D.C., he revealed his progressive roots, to the consternation of his more conservative Republican peers. Morse had intended to pull the Republican Party leftwards on the issue of union rights, a stance that put him at odds with many of the more right-wing Republicans. Morse&#x27;s political heroes were other progressive Republicans such as Theodore Roosevelt and Robert La Follette, and despite being a Republican admitted that he had voted in the 1944 presidential election for Franklin D. Roosevelt against the Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey. He was greatly influenced by the &quot;one world&quot; philosophy of Wendell Willkie, making it clear from the onset he was an internationalist, which caused much tension with the Republican Senate Minority Leader, Robert A. Taft who favored a quasi-isolationist foreign policy.

Morse believed that World War II had been partly caused by American isolationism and in one of his first speeches before the Senate, in February 1945, called on the United States to join the planned organization that would replace the League of Nations, namely the United Nations (UN). As a former law professor, Morse believed very strongly in international law, and in the same speech called upon the United Nations to be an &quot;international police organization&quot; with such powers as to enforce via military means international law against any nation that might break it and to be given the power to prevent rich nations from economically exploiting poor nations. In another speech in March 1945, he called upon the two militarily strongest members of the &quot;Big Three&quot; alliance, namely the Soviet Union and the United States to work together after the war to preserve the peace and end poverty all over the world. In a speech in November 1945, he declared his concern as he &quot;watched some of the nations of the world taking a toboggan ride down the slopes of national aggrandizement and into the abyss of blind nationalism.&quot; In the same speech, he deplored the &quot;rattling of swords and manufacturing of atomic bombs&quot; as he called the nations of the world to stop dividing themselves into &quot;power blocs&quot;, to take their disputes to the World Court and for the UN to have control of nuclear weapons, which he maintained were too dangerous to be entrusted to any nation.

In January 1946, after President Truman delivered an address criticizing Congress and defending his proposals, Morse referred to President Truman&#x27;s speech as a &quot;sad confession of the Democratic majority in Congress under the President&#x27;s leadership&quot; and called for the election of liberal Republicans in the midterm elections that year. Also in January 1946, Morse called on Congress to vote on President Truman&#x27;s pending legislation, citing continued delay would produce &quot;a great economic uncertainty&quot; and add to &quot;reconversion slow-up&quot;. He asserted that Americans were entitled to Congress being held accountable for the passage of bills. In 1946, Morse cosponsored legislation proposing a full Senate investigation into labor dispute causes, saying in March, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve got to find out whether certain segments of industry are out to wreck unions.&quot; He was outspoken in his opposition to the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, which concerned labor relations.

In April 1946, Morse in a speech denounced &quot;blind national isolationism&quot; and the tendency of many Americans to forget about their responsibilities to the &quot;one-world community&quot; in which they lived. He charged that too many Americans had a &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude towards other nations and the assumption &quot;that if any bad faith is ever practiced within the world of nations, it is always practiced by nations other than the United States.&quot; Morse concluded that America had not always practiced &quot;simon-pure&quot; behavior and had economically exploited poor nations. In a speech in February 1947, Morse called Wendell Willkie his principal inspiration in foreign policy, saying that &quot;human rights cannot be nationalized or become the monopoly of any nation&quot; and the nations of the world must work towards &quot;a one-world philosophy of permanent peace.&quot; Morse argued that a system of international law was needed to protect the weak nations from being dominated and exploited by strong nations. Morse strongly criticized imperialism, saying neither the Netherlands or Great Britain was a suitable ally for the United States, criticizing the Dutch for attempting to reconquer their lost colony of the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) and the British for staying in the Palestine Mandate (modern Israel) against the wishes of the majority of people in Palestine, both Jewish and Arab. Morse urged both the Dutch and the British to leave the Dutch East Indies and Palestine, saying they did not have the right to rule places where they were not wanted. He supported Zionism, arguing that after the Holocaust the Jews needed their own state, and urged Britain to leave Palestine so that a Jewish state to be called Israel could be created.

Though Morse had early on called for the United States to work with the Soviet Union, as the Cold War began he supported the foreign policy of President Harry S. Truman as necessary to stop Soviet expansionism. Morse voted for the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, for the National Security Act and for the United States to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

In March 1948, Morse said he would support a tax reduction on the premise of world conditions worsening and Congress thereby being forced to recall the tax cut and admitted both his personal fear of large reductions and belief that Americans wanted tax cuts.

In February 1949, during a Senate Labor committee session, Morse stated the Truman administration labor bill was not going to pass in the Senate based on how it was presently written and that &quot;a lot of compromises must be made&quot;. That year, Morse also put forward legislation that would impose national emergency strikes be handled on a case-by-case basis, the plan being turned down by the Senate on June 30 in a vote of 77 to 9. The vote was seen as a victory for supporters of the Taft–Hartley Act&#x27;s provision allowing the government to get injunctions against critical strikes, though opposition was noted to have arisen from senators that did not favor this provision.

In 1950, when Truman used United Nations Security Council Resolution 84 as the legal basis for committing U.S. forces to action in the Korean War, Morse supported his decision. At the time, Morse argued that Article 2 of the American constitution gave the president &quot;very broad powers in times of emergency and national crisis&quot; and that the resolution from the UN Security Council was binding. At the same time, Morse also warned Truman to &quot;not get sucked&quot; into a war in Asia and condemned him for agreeing to support France in its efforts to hold onto Vietnam. Taft was opposed to using Resolution 84 as the basis for going to war in Korea, and in subsequently brought Morse around to his viewpoint that Truman acted illegally by not asking Congress for a declaration of war.

In November 1950, Morse stated his belief that the incoming 82nd United States Congress would attempt revamping the Taft–Hartley Act and while admitting his continued opposition to the law, acknowledged portions of the Act that he believed could be incorporated into subsequent legislation.

=== Re-election and independence from the Republican Party ===
Morse was reelected in 1950. Earlier in that year, he was one of the six Senators who supported Margaret Chase Smith&#x27;s Declaration of Conscience, which criticized the tactics of McCarthyism.

Morse was kicked in the head by a horse in 1951. He sustained major injuries: the kick &quot;tore his lips nearly off, fractured his jaw in four places, knocked out most of his upper teeth, and loosened several others.&quot;

In protest of Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s selection of Richard Nixon as his running mate, Morse left the Republican Party in 1952. Morse criticized the 1952 Republican platform with its call to repeal much of the New Deal and further felt that Eisenhower had shown cowardice by his refusal to publicly criticize Senator Joseph McCarthy, whom Morse felt was a menace to American democracy. The 1952 election produced an almost evenly divided Senate; Morse brought a folding chair when the session convened, intending to position himself in the aisle between the Democrats and Republicans to underscore his lack of party affiliation. Morse expected to retain certain committee memberships but was denied membership on the Labor Committee and others. He used a parliamentary procedure to force a vote of the entire Senate but lost his bid. New York&#x27;s Senator Herbert Lehman offered Morse his seat on the Labor Committee, which Morse ultimately accepted.

As a result of Morse&#x27;s becoming an Independent, Republican control was reduced to a 48–47 majority. The deaths of nine senators, and the resignation of another, caused many reversals in control of the Senate during that session.

In January 1953, after Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Charles E. Wilson as United States Secretary of State, Morse told reporters a possible objection to the nomination could stem from the more than 10,000 General Motors shares owned by the nominee&#x27;s wife. In February, Morse stated that Eisenhower was partly to blame for a waste of both American manpower and money as it pertained to overseas military bases, reasoning that this had occurred while he was commander of NATO forces in Europe under the Democratic administration of President Truman. In July, Morse joined nine Democrats in sponsoring a bill proposing a revision of present law to add 13,000 people to Social Security and aid benefits increases. Later that month, after the death of Senate Majority Leader Robert A. Taft and questions arose of continued Republican control of the Senate, Morse confirmed his &quot;ethical obligation&quot; to vote with members of the party on Senate organizational issues and preserve the GOP Senate majority, citing his belief that he was acting on behalf of the American people given the Republicans gaining a majority in the 1952 elections.

In 1953, Morse conducted a filibuster for 22 hours and 26 minutes protesting the Submerged Lands Act, which at the time was the longest one-person filibuster in U.S. Senate history (a record surpassed four years later by Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 24-hour-18-minute filibuster in opposition of the Civil Rights Act of 1957). In 1954, with France on the verge of defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, Eisenhower tentatively put forward a plan code-named Operation Vulture for American intervention. Morse spoke against U.S. intervention, saying &quot;The American people are in no mood to contemplate the killing of thousands of American boys in Indochina&quot; on the basis of &quot;generalities&quot;. Morse also demanded that Congress be allowed to vote on Operation Vulture first, stating &quot;if we get into another war, this country will be in it before Congress ever has time to declare war&quot;. After the French defeat, Morse accused Eisenhower of making the same mistakes as France did by assuming that a military solution was the best solution to Vietnamese revolutionary nationalism. Morse argued that the United States should work through the United Nations for a diplomatic solution of the Vietnam issue and to promote economic growth that would lift Vietnam out of its Third World poverty. He argued that such a policy would give the Soviet Union &quot;clear notice&quot; that the world community intended to protect the nations of Indochina their &quot;right to self-government until such time as free elections can be held&quot;. After the Geneva Accords which ended the Indochina War, Morse accused the Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, of having led America into &quot;a diplomatic defeat of major significance.&quot; In September 1954, Morse voted for the United States to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization because it conformed to the UN Charter.

In late 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began and Morse led the fight in the Senate against what became the Formosa Resolution. Morse argued that the &quot;predated authorization&quot; of military force that the resolution allowed violated the constitution as he noted the constitution explicitly stated that Congress had the power to declare war, and at most the president can do is merely ask Congress to declare war if he feels the situation warrants such a step. Morse proposed three amendments to the Formosa Resolution, all of which were defeated.

Ruth Shipley headed the Passport Division of the United States Department of State from 1928 to 1955. She received criticism for denying passports for political reasons in the absence of due process rights but also got support as her actions were seen as opposing Communism. Linus Pauling, who had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, had his 1953 passport application that would have allowed him to accept the Prize in Sweden refused by Shipley. In rejecting his application, she cited the standard language of her office, that issuance &quot;would not be in the best interests of the United States.&quot; but that decision was overruled. Morse characterized her decisions as &quot;tyrannical and capricious&quot; due to her failures to disclose her actual reasons for the denial of such passport applications. Her supporters included President Truman&#x27;s Secretary of State Dean Acheson and U.S. Senator Pat McCarran of Nevada, the author of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, Section 6 of which made it a crime for any member of a communist organization to use or obtain a passport. In 1964, that provision was declared unconstitutional by the &quot;United States Supreme Court.

In 1955, Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson persuaded Morse to join the Democratic caucus.

=== Joining the Democratic Party ===
After a term as an independent, during which he campaigned heavily for Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Richard Neuberger in 1954, Morse switched to the Democratic Party in February 1955. His switch meant that the Democrats won control of the Senate and had been facilitated through giving Morse his desired places on the Foreign Affairs and Banking Committees. The New York Times&#x27; Saturday, February 19, 1955, issue featured a front-page photograph of Morse with the caption, &quot;Democrats Welcome Morse to the Fold.&quot; The New York Times noted that Morse had made the switch and registered as a Democrat that Friday in his hometown of Eugene, Oregon.

In his book, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, Sen. John F. Kennedy makes reference to Morse&#x27;s time in the Republican and then later in the Democratic Party during Kennedy&#x27;s tenure in the Senate.

When the Formosa resolution came to a vote in January 1955, Morse was one of the three senators who voted against the resolution. In February 1955, during his first public appearance as a Democrat, Morse stated that the vote on the Formosa resolution would have been different if senators were not under the belief that a resolution for a ceasefire was going to be introduced the following week and that Americans did not want war with the Chinese.

Despite his changes in party allegiance, for which he was branded a maverick, Morse won re-election to the United States Senate in 1956. He defeated U.S. Secretary of the Interior and former governor Douglas McKay in a hotly contested race; campaign expenditures totaled over $600,000 between the primary and general elections, a very high amount by then-contemporary standards. One of the major issues of the campaign were proposals for the Hells Canyon Dam which Morse wanted to be publicly built and run and McKay wanted to be privately run.

In March 1957 when King Saud of Saudi Arabia visited Washington and was hailed by Eisenhower as America&#x27;s number one ally in the Middle East, Morse was not impressed. In a speech before the Senate, Morse stated: &quot;Here we are, pouring by the way of gifts to that completely totalitarian state, Saudi Arabia, millions of dollars of the taxpayers&#x27; money to maintain the military forces of a dictatorship. We ought to have our heads examined!&quot; Morse charged that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s abysmal record on human rights made it an unacceptable ally.

In 1957, Morse voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He was the only Senator opposed to the bill who was not from the South.

In 1959, Morse opposed Eisenhower&#x27;s appointment of Clare Boothe Luce as ambassador to Brazil. Morse, who had known Luce for many years, chastised Luce for her criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although the Senate confirmed Luce&#x27;s appointment in a 79–11 vote, Luce retaliated against him. In a conversation with a reporter at a party before she departed for Brazil, Luce commented that her troubles with Senator Morse were attributable to the injuries he sustained from being kicked by a horse in 1951. She also remarked that riots in Bolivia might be dealt with by dividing the country up among its neighbors. An immediate backlash against these remarks from Morse and other senators, and Luce&#x27;s refusal to retract the remark about the horse, led to her resignation just three days after her appointment.

On September 4, 1959, Morse charged Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson with having attempted to form a dictatorship over other Senate Democrats and with failing to defend individual senators&#x27; rights.

=== Feud with Richard Neuberger ===
Toward the end of the 1950s, Morse&#x27;s relationship with Richard Neuberger, the junior senator from Oregon, deteriorated and led to much public feuding. The two had known each other since 1931, when Morse was dean of the University of Oregon law school, and Neuberger was a 19-year-old freshman. Morse befriended Neuberger and often gave him advice, and he used his rhetorical skill to successfully defend Neuberger against charges of academic cheating. After the charges against him were dropped, Neuberger rejected Morse&#x27;s advice to leave the university and start afresh elsewhere but instead enrolled in Morse&#x27;s class in criminal law. Morse gave him a &quot;D&quot; in the course and, when Neuberger complained, changed the grade to an &quot;F&quot;.

According to Mason Drukman, one of Morse&#x27;s biographers, even after the two men had become senators, neither could get past what had happened in 1931. &quot;Whatever his accomplishments,&quot; Drukman writes, &quot;Neuberger was to Morse a man flawed in character&quot; while Neuberger &quot;could not forgive Morse either for propelling him out of law school ... or for having had to protect him in the honor proceedings.&quot; Morse later helped Neuberger, who won his Senate seat in 1954 by only 2,462 votes out of more than a half-million cast, but he also continued to give Neuberger advice that was not always appreciated. &quot;I don&#x27;t think you should scold me so much,&quot; said Neuberger, as quoted by Drukman, in a letter to Morse during the 1954 campaign.

By 1957, the relationship had deteriorated to the point where, rather than talking face-to-face, the senators exchanged angry letters delivered almost daily by messenger between offices in close proximity. Although the letters were private, the feud quickly became public through letters leaked to the press and comments made to colleagues and other third parties, who often had trouble deciding what the fight was about. Drukman describes the feud as a &quot;classic struggle ... of dominating father and rebellious son locked in the age-old fight for supremacy.&quot; The feud ended only with Neuberger&#x27;s death from a stroke in 1960.

=== 1960 presidential campaign ===
Morse was a late entry in the race for the Democratic nomination for president in 1960. It began unofficially at a 1959 press conference held at the state capitol in Salem by local resident Gary Neal and other Morse supporters. They declared they would put Senator Morse on the ballot by petition. As early as April 1959, Morse told a meeting of the state&#x27;s Young Democrats that he had no intention of running. The group still voted to advance Senator Morse, after Congresswoman Edith Green introduced him as a favorite son.

Gary Neal was persistent and by winter of 1959 was nearing completion of his signature petition to place Morse on the May ballot. Morse soon found himself at a meeting with Neal where they discussed his efforts. Neal said to Morse, &quot;if we [supporters] don&#x27;t put your name on the ballot, your enemies will.&quot; It was clear the elephant in the room with Gary Neal and Wayne Morse was the Oregon Republican Party. Morse shot back about the Oregon Republicans, &quot;I say to the Republican Party, trot out your governor. I&#x27;m ready to take him on.&quot;

On December 22, 1959, Wayne Morse announced his candidacy for president. He said at his announcement, &quot;Although I would have preferred not to have entered the Oregon race, I shall not run away from a good political fight if it is inevitable.&quot; The Morse for President Oregon Headquarters was located at 353 S.W. Morrison St. Portland, Oregon 97204. The Morse entry into the presidential race did not sit well with many who had anticipated significant campaigning in Oregon from a large field of candidates. Morse was accused of flip-flopping on whether or not he would run.

Morse filed to run in May primaries in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Oregon, in that order. He had solid connections in all three areas. Oregon was his home and where his wife and family lived. He owned a small farm in Poolesville, Maryland, and had spent fifteen years fighting for D.C. home rule, sponsoring legislation for that cause. Kennedy did not enter the D.C. primary. Senator Hubert Humphrey was Morse&#x27;s main opponent in the D.C. contest, which Humphrey won 7,831 to 5,866.

Morse had known when he entered the Maryland contest that he was climbing an extremely steep hill, and had hoped to offset a potential loss there with a win in the District. John F. Kennedy was a Catholic and Maryland was the birthplace of the American Catholic church. Morse attempted to generate as much media coverage as possible. The New York Times caught wind of the Morse campaign and did their best to follow Morse around. Morse made his liberalism a key issue at every campaign stop. His remarks in Cumberland, Maryland, suggest that Kennedy was anything but a liberal:

When the Eisenhower Administration took office one of its first objectives was to riddle the tax code with favors for big business and it did so with the help of the Senator from Massachusetts. We need a candidate who will reverse the big money and big business domination of government. We need a courageous candidate who will stand up and fight the necessary political battle for the welfare of the average American. Kennedy has never been willing to do that.

As Morse had predicted, he lost to Kennedy in Maryland. Morse continued to pursue his liberalism strategy as the campaign moved to his home turf. Oregon Democrats prepared for a showdown between Morse and Kennedy, although five candidates would appear on the Oregon ballot. Humphrey, to this point Kennedy&#x27;s main challenger in the primaries, had lost badly to Kennedy in West Virginia and had dropped out of the race.

The Kennedy campaign began to focus on Oregon. Its workers repeatedly denied that Morse was a serious candidate, but to make sure of a win, the campaign sent Rose Kennedy and Ted Kennedy to speak in Oregon and outspent Morse $54,000 to $9,000. Morse often found himself responding to Kennedy&#x27;s claim that he was not a &quot;serious candidate&quot;, by proclaiming: &quot;I&#x27;m a dead serious candidate.&quot; Quietly, Oregon Democrats began to worry about what a loss for Morse would mean in 1962 against possible Republican challenger Governor Mark Hatfield. Morse would use this to his advantage to help sway undecided Democrats, claiming that if he lost in the primary, it would certainly help Republicans defeat him in 1962. Kennedy brushed off this argument by claiming that regardless of the outcome of the presidential primary, the people of Oregon had a tremendous respect for Wayne Morse and would send him back to the Senate, and that he would even come back to Oregon in 1962 to campaign for him. On Election Day, Morse came up roughly 50,000 votes short of defeating Kennedy. Morse abandoned his presidential race that same week.

Morse largely sat out the rest of the 1960 campaign. He even opted out of going to the 1960 Democratic National Convention. Instead he sat at home and watched it on television from Eugene.

=== Final Senate term ===
In September 1960, after Democrats James Eastland and Thomas Dodd asserted that lower-ranking officials in the State Department had cleared the way for the regime of Fidel Castro to reign in Cuba, Morse denied the charge and stated that he knew of no basis for the claim.

In February 1961, during a press release, Morse announced his intent to request $12 million for civil works in Oregon from Congress, furthering that the request would be based around information gathered by the Corps of Engineers and that the state of Oregon was facing &quot;serious economic conditions&quot;. In March 1961, after President Kennedy nominated Charles M. Meriwether for Director of the Export-Import Bank, Morse labeled Meriwether as racist and antisemitic. Morse added that President Kennedy owed an apology to every Jewish and black person in the United States as a result of the appointment.

In April 1961, Morse was outraged by the Bay of Pigs invasion, and in a letter to the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, accused the Kennedy administration of acting unconstitutionally as he expressed his &quot;deep regret&quot; that Congress was not informed by the administration &quot;prior to making its decision to intervene in the Cuban invasion through granting logistic and other support to the Cuban exiles.&quot; In May 1961, Morse announced that the Senate Latin Affairs Committee would investigate reports that the United States was holding survivors of the Bay of Pigs Invasion incommunicado on U.S. submarine base in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Morse said the investigation had primarily been handled by White House staff instead of State Department officials.

In January 1962, at the nomination hearing of John A. McCone whom Kennedy had nominated as CIA director, Morse accused the CIA having &quot;an unchecked executive power that ought to be brought to an end&quot;. Speaking of the Bay of Pigs invasion, he accused the CIA of engaging in reckless actions that could easily cause a war and stated: &quot;We are in a situation in which we shall probably never again see Congress pass a declaration of war prior to the beginning of a war.&quot;
In February 1963, Morse stated that the United States was providing France with more foreign aid &quot;than any other country in the world&quot; and that France was concurrently not fulfilling responsibilities as they pertained to NATO, adding that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would investigate how much aid France should receive from the US amid its continued defiance and France should be allowed to be independent foreign policy outside of the Atlantic alliance if President of France Charles De Gaulle wanted to.

In February 1963, after President Kennedy contended that American air cover for the Cuban invasion was never promised, Morse stated that the comments were supported by the testimony of members of the Kennedy administration following the invasion and that the document containing the testimony should be made public as a result of &quot;subsequent developments&quot;. Morse contended that the Kennedy administration-created Alliance for Progress was &quot;a belated program&quot; that should have been created during the previous decade at a time with lessened &quot;critical and social pressures&quot; and furthered that &quot;a great mistake&quot; would be made in believing the program would be successful in completing its goal within 10 years.

In the spring of 1964, Morse began to call the Vietnam War &quot;McNamara&#x27;s War&quot; after the hawkish Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. In a speech on 17 April 1964, Morse stated &quot;Not one voice has yet answered my contention that the United States, under the leadership of Defense Secretary McNamara, is fighting an illegal and unwise war in Vietnam.&quot;. A month later on May 20, 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Congress to vote for a request of additional $125 million in aid to South Vietnam, Morse voted against the request, accusing Johnson of &quot;trying by indirection to obtain
congressional approval of our illegal, unilateral military action in South Vietnam without coming forward with a request for a declaration of war.&quot;

By 1964, Morse had the reputation of being the &quot;Typhoid Mary&quot; of the Senate, an eccentric whose humorlessness and teetotalism made him widely disliked and shunned by the other senators. Morse&#x27;s refusal to drink alcohol under any circumstances together with a lack of humor that was legendary within the Senate excluded him from the &quot;Club&quot; of the Senate, where important informal meetings were held in private in a convivial atmosphere where much alcohol was consumed. When Morse spoke before the Senate, he usually allowed only five to ten minutes to speak before the other senators voted to cut him off. However, Morse was also known as a stubborn and cantankerous character who was determined to uphold Congress&#x27;s powers against the presidency, and in a memo to President Johnson in March 1964, William Bundy predicted that Morse was the senator most likely to oppose a congressional resolution giving Johnson the power to wage war in Vietnam.  

On August 7, 1964, Morse, who had won re-election in 1962, was one of only two United States senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (Alaska&#x27;s Ernest Gruening was the other). Ten other senators voted &quot;present&quot; or missed the vote. It authorized an expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. His central contention was that the resolution violated Article One of the United States Constitution, granting the president the ability to take military action in the absence of a formal declaration of war. In a speech before the Senate, Morse stated &quot;I rise to speak in opposition to the joint resolution [S.J. Res. 189]. I do so with a sad heart. But I consider the resolution, as I considered the resolution of 1955, known as the Formosa resolution, and the subsequent resolution, known as the Middle East resolution, to be naught but a resolution which embodies a predated declaration of war.&quot;

In a speech on 18 February 1965, Morse in a speech “completely” repudiated Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam policy, accusing the president of leading the United States into a war unconstitutionally. When Johnson announced the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam code-named Operation Rolling Thunder, Morse stated the president &quot;has not the slightest legal right under the Constitution of the United States to be bombing North Vietnam, short of a declaration of war.&quot; On 24 March 1965, the first campus protest against the Vietnam War took place with a &quot;teach-in&quot; at the University of Michigan. In a letter to John Donoughue, the organizer of the protest at the University of Michigan, Morse praised the &quot;Teach-in Protest&quot; and stated: &quot;It is urgent that the American people insist that their country return to a respect for law before we create a holocaust in Asia.&quot; In April 1965, Morse took part in an anti-war protest for the first time when he spoke at a &quot;teach-in&quot; at the University of Oregon where he offered lavish praise for the student protesters, saying that as an old man it gladdened him to see so many young people willing to take a stand.  On 8 June 1965, Morse was the lead speaker at an anti-war rally attended by 17, 000 people at Madison Square Garden in New York.
During the following years Morse remained one of the country&#x27;s most outspoken critics of the war. It was later revealed that the FBI investigated Morse based on his opposition to the war, allegedly at the request of President Johnson in an attempt to find information that could be used politically against Morse. In June 1965, Morse joined Benjamin Spock, Coretta Scott King and others in leading a large anti-war march in New York City. After that, Morse &quot;readily joined such protests when he could, and eagerly called upon others to participate.&quot;

In February 1966, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, J. William Fulbright, held televised hearings about the Vietnam war, which Morse took part in as a member of the committee. Johnson sent General Maxwell Taylor before the committee as a rebuttal witness. In response to Taylor&#x27;s testimony, Morse said: &quot;I happen to hold to the point of view that it isn&#x27;t going to be long before the American people, as a people, will repudiate our war in Southeast Asia&quot;. In response, Taylor stated &quot;That of course, is good news to Hanoi, Senator&quot;.  An infuriated Morse snapped back: &quot;I know that is the smear that you militarists give to those of us who have honest differences of opinion with you, but I don&#x27;t intend to get down in the gutter with you and engage in that kind of debate, General!&quot;

In the 1966 U.S. Senate election, he angered many in his own party for supporting Oregon&#x27;s Republican Governor, Mark Hatfield, over the Democratic nominee, Congressman Robert Duncan, in that year&#x27;s Senate election, due to Duncan&#x27;s support of the Vietnam War. Hatfield won that race, and Duncan then challenged Morse in the 1968 Democratic senatorial primary. Morse won renomination, but only by a narrow margin. Morse lost his seat in the 1968 general election to State Representative Bob Packwood, who criticized Morse&#x27;s opposition to continued funding of the war as being reckless, and as distracting him from other issues of importance to the state. Packwood won by a mere 3,500 votes, less than one half of one percent of the total votes cast.

== Post-Senate career ==

Morse spent most of the remaining years of his life attempting to regain his membership in the U.S. Senate. His first attempt since being defeated in 1968 was in 1972. He won the Democratic primary against his old foe, Robert Duncan. In the general election, he lost to the incumbent Mark Hatfield, the Republican incumbent whom he had endorsed in 1966 over fellow Democrat Duncan because of Hatfield&#x27;s shared opposition to the war in Vietnam but which had become for Morse, according to his principal biographer, a &quot;dismissible virtue&quot; in 1972.

In that same year, following the withdrawal of Thomas Eagleton from the national Democratic ticket, a &quot;mini convention&quot; was called to confirm Sargent Shriver as George McGovern&#x27;s vice presidential running mate. Although most of the delegates voted for Shriver, Oregon cast 4 of its 34 votes for Morse.

On March 19, 1974, Morse, at age 73, filed the paperwork to seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat he had lost six years before. Three other Oregon Democrats filed to run against Morse in the 1974 Democratic primary election on May 28 and made Morse&#x27;s age a key campaign issue. His most prominent opponent was Oregon Senate President Jason Boe. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in an editorial that Morse would serve the state with &quot;fierce integrity if elected&quot;. Morse managed to defeat Boe in the primary and began preparing for the general election.

On July 21, 1974, while trying to keep up a busy campaign schedule, Morse was hospitalized at Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland due to kidney failure and was listed in critical condition. He died the next day. An editorial ran in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating that death &quot;has deprived the United States Senate of a superb public servant&quot;.

The Oregon Democratic Central Committee met in August and nominated state Senator Betty Roberts to replace Morse as the Democratic nominee in the Senate race. Roberts lost to the incumbent Bob Packwood in the fall.

==Legacy==

A dozen years after joining the Democratic Party, Morse&#x27;s lack of lifelong commitment to a single political party was viewed as his contribution to a longstanding tradition in the politics of the Western United States.

Wayne Morse was given a state funeral on July 26, 1974, in the Oregon House of Representatives. His body lay in state in the Capitol rotunda before the funeral. More than 600 people attended the funeral service. Former Senator Eugene McCarthy, Governor Tom McCall, Senator Mark Hatfield and Oregon House Speaker Richard Eymann were all in attendance. Pallbearers included Oregon Congressman Al Ullman and three candidates for Congress, Democrats Les AuCoin, Jim Weaver, and Morse&#x27;s old rival, Robert B. Duncan, who was running for a seat vacated by Congresswoman Edith Green.

When Congressman AuCoin sought to unseat Senator Packwood 18 years later, he adopted Morse&#x27;s slogan, &quot;principle above politics&quot;. Since 1996, the U.S. Senate seat Morse filled has been held by Ron Wyden who as a 19-year-old, drove Morse in the senator&#x27;s last campaign. Elected in a special election after Packwood&#x27;s resignation, Wyden won a full term in 1998 and re-election in 2004, 2010, 2016 and 2022.

In 2006, the Wayne L. Morse U.S. Courthouse opened in downtown Eugene. In addition, he was recognized in the Wayne Morse Commons of the University of Oregon&#x27;s William W. Knight Law Center. Also housed in the University of Oregon Law Center is the Wayne Morse Center for Law and Politics. The Lane County Courthouse in Eugene renovated and rededicated its adjacent Wayne L. Morse Free Speech Plaza in the spring of 2005, complete with a life-size statue and pavers imprinted with quotations.

The Morse family&#x27;s Eugene property and home, Edgewood Farm, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wayne Morse Farm. The City of Eugene, assisted by a nonprofit corporation, operates the historical park formerly known as Morse Ranch. The City of Eugene officially renamed the park Wayne Morse Family Farm in 2008, following a recommendation by the Wayne Morse Historical Park Corporation Board and Morse family members. The new name is more historically accurate. Wayne L. Morse is interred at Rest Haven Memorial Park in Eugene.
