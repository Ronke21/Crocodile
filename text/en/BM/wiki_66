* Early January – The president of the Indian Science Congress, R.S. Paroda, warns a conference of 3,000 Indian scientists that the country could face a severe food shortage in 2020 as the population size outstrips the country&#x27;s level of supplies.

Fears of a major epidemic are increased as the thousands of corpses still trapped beneath fallen buildings begin to decompose.
* Early February – The government grants refugee status to Ogyen Trinley Dorje, a controversial claimant to the 17th Karmapa title. The Karmapa was in India since escaping Tibet in early 2000.
* 2 February – An unprecedented telephone conversation between Prime Minister Vajpayee and Pakistani military leader General Pervez Musharraf is hailed as a major step in relations between the two countries.

* 1 March - As per 2001 Census of India, India becomes the second nation in the world to register one billion people in its population. The first was China in 1979.
* 13 March - Tehelka broke its sting operation story of Operation West End.
* 15 March – Defense Minister George Fernandes resigns in a bribery scandal which threatens to bring down the government. The leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Bangaru Laxman, has already left his position, but the departures fail to calm opposition parties, who continue to stall the workings of parliament for a third day on 16 March. Journalists released secretly filmed footage on the Internet, showing government members from the defense ministry and other senior figures accepting bribes from bogus arms dealers.
* 23 March - Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank - Ketan Parekh scam. 
* 28 March – A counter-insurgency Special Operations Group (SOG) patrol claims to have killed Salaudin Ayubi, the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Toiba&#x27;s leader in the Kashmir valley, in a shootout near Srinagar. There has been a spate of attacks by militants in Srinagar in recent months, although the ceasefire announced by the Indian government in November remains nominally in place.

* 2 April-4 April – A conference in Delhi, organized under the UN Environment Programme&#x27;s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), brings together for the first time the members of a new task force on the future of tigers in the wild – thought to number 5,000–7,000 in total.
* Early April – In a bold attempt to hasten an end to violence in separatist Kashmir, the government offers unconditional peace talks to Kashmiri militants. However, with no invitation to the Pakistani authorities it is not likely to attract much response from the separatists.
* Early April – The Tibetan spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, welcomes news that tens of thousands of Dalits (lower-caste Hindus) are to convert to Buddhism on 14 October.
* Early April – Tea production in the northeastern region of Darjeeling is adversely affected by an indefinite general strike called by the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) over the government&#x27;s failure to identify the perpetrators of an attack on their leader, Subhas Ghising.
* Mid-April – Extra troops are dispatched to the Bangladeshi border after 18 soldiers are killed in escalating shooting incidents. Tension in the region has mounted over a disputed section of the border south of Assam.
* Mid-April – Opposition parties recommence the disruption of parliament in an attempt to force the government to launch an investigation into an allegedly corrupt arms deal.
* 18 April – The country&#x27;s space program is brought into a new era with the successful test launch of its geostationary satellite launch vehicle, the GSLV-D1, at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. The program had caused embarrassment for the country&#x27;s space agency in late March when the first test launch, broadcast live on television, was aborted as flames burst from the craft on ignition. Communications satellites launched in India have hitherto been propelled by Arianespace or Russian rockets, and the GSLV-D1 is planned as a less costly alternative.
* 22 April – The U.S.-based current affairs magazine &quot;TIME&quot; apologizes emphatically for the offense caused by the printing of a depiction of Muhammad – considered a blasphemy in Islam – which had sparked large riots in Kashmir the previous day.
* 22 April – The government is outraged when medical reports suggest that many of the 16 soldiers killed by Bangladeshi forces in border skirmishes were mutilated and tortured before being murdered.

* Early May – Ten people are killed in pre-electoral clashes in the northeastern state of Assam as the outlawed separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) clashes with soldiers. State elections are to be held on 10 May.
* Early May – Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan announces that the government will open up the country&#x27;s arms production industry to private investors, including up to 26% to foreign capital.
* Mid-May – The ruling BJP suffers defeat in five key state elections, losing ground to the opposition Congress (I) party in Assam, Kerala, and Pondicherry. In Tamil Nadu a coalition allied to Congress (I) sweeps to power making Jayaram Jayalalitha, a former film star with a conviction for bribery, chief minister there. In West Bengal the communist Left Front is returned to power continuing its record as the world&#x27;s longest serving elected communist government.
* Mid-May – Prime Minister Vajpayee announces that India will honour the ASEAN treaty keeping Southeast Asia a nuclear weapons-free zone.

No smugglers are caught.
* 10 June – The Kashmiri separatist All Party Hurriyat Conference announces the suspension of all strikes and rallies in the province pending a summit between Indian and Pakistani leaders scheduled for July.
* 15 June – A plot to bomb the United States embassy in New Delhi, allegedly masterminded by the notorious Osama bin Laden, is foiled by police.
* 17 June – Thousands of demonstrators clash with police and set fire to the Manipur state legislature in Imphal. The protests are over an agreement between the government and separatist rebels from the neighbouring state of Nagaland to extend their three-year ceasefire for another year, and to widen the deal to areas beyond the state. The protestors claim that the extension will undermine regional security.
* 18 June – The government announces that Pakistani military ruler General Pervez Musharraf is expected in India on 14 July for a landmark summit with Indian leaders.
* 21 June – A deal is signed by which the world-famous Taj Mahal monument is to receive private sponsorship from the Taj Hotel Group.

=== July ===
* Early July – Police in the southern state of Tamil Nadu are ordered to shoot violent protestors on sight following unrest in the region prompted by the brief detention of the state&#x27;s former chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi.

The All-Party Hurriyat Conference of Muslim separatists and the Pakistani government both immediately condemn the attack but the Indian government accuses the Pakistani authorities of collusion.

* Mid-December – Tension between India and Pakistan escalates rapidly after the Indian government accuses its Pakistani counterpart of supporting a terrorist attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi. The threat of all-out war between India and Pakistan looms large across the New Year with both sides massing forces along their common border. There is an exchange of mortar fire across the &quot;line of control&quot;, the de facto border in Kashmir, on 2 January. However, the leaders of both countries express hope that conflict could be avoided amid a massive international diplomatic effort, including a regional visit from UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

<text>Maeve Hillery (; 14 August 1924 – 10 January 2015) was an Irish anaesthetist who was the wife of the 6th President of Ireland, Patrick Hillery.

== Life and family ==
Mary Beatrice Finnegan was born on 14 August 1924 in Sheffield, Yorkshire. Her father was a builder from Galway, and her mother was half-Irish. Hillery would holiday in Ireland as a child, and, during World War II, she attended a boarding school in Galway for a year. She entered University College Galway (UCG), and qualified as a doctor. She then attended University College Dublin (UCD), where she studied to become an anaesthetist. It was here that she met her future husband, Patrick Hillery, who was also studying medicine. She worked in Jervis Street Hospital, St James&#x27; Hospital, and in Sheffield. The couple married on 27 October 1955. The Hillerys practised medicine together in Milltown Malbay while her husband was a TD. Together they had a son, John, and an adopted daughter, Vivienne. Vivienne died in 1987 from leukemia.

Hillery died in Dublin, on 10 January 2015. She was buried in St Fintan&#x27;s Cemetery, Sutton.

== Career ==
Hillery&#x27;s husband served in a number of political roles, including foreign minister and European Commissioner. After the completion of his term as a European Commissioner in 1976, he contemplated leaving politics and returning to medicine. Instead, Hillery was asked to become the sixth President of Ireland. The woollen cloak she worn to her husband&#x27;s inauguration as president is now held in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks. She used a number of Irish designers during her 13 years in Áras an Uachtaráin, highlighting Irish design and materials.

During the few rare interviews Hillery gave she spoke about the enormous upkeep and maintenance the presidential residence required, its unsuitability as a family home, and undertook the restoration of parts of the house. Due to her husband&#x27;s career, Hillery did give up practising medicine, but she undertook a course in public health at University of Louvain, and a diploma in child care. She maintained a particular interest in children&#x27;s mental health, was part of a research committee at St Michael&#x27;s House, and worked with Dr Victoria Coffey on her study of Down Syndrome. She also learnt Irish Sign Language.

Hillery served as the patron and president of a number of charities and voluntary groups including the Ana Liffey Drug Project, Care Alliance Ireland, Femscan, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped, and the Association for Deaf Children. She was among a number of prominent Irish women who contributed recipes to a book, &quot;Welcome To Our Kitchen&quot;, which was produced by Femscan to raise money towards Ireland&#x27;s first mobile breast cancer screening unit.

<doc id="420360" wikidata="Q173441" url="?curid=420360" title="Muhammad al-Idrisi">
<text>Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Idrisi al-Qurtubi al-Hasani as-Sabti, or simply al-Idrisi (; ; 1100–1165), was a Muslim geographer and cartographer who served in the court of King Roger II at Palermo, Sicily. Muhammad al-Idrisi was born in Ceuta, then belonging to the Almoravid dynasty. He created the , one of the most advanced medieval world maps.

==Early life==
Al-Idrisi hailed from the Hammudid dynasty of North Africa and Al-Andalus, which was descended from Muhammad through the powerful Idrisid dynasty. Al-Idrisi was believed to be born the city of Ceuta in 1100, at the time controlled by the Almoravids, where his great-grandfather had been forced to settle after the fall of Hammudid Málaga to the Zirids of Granada. He spent much of his early life travelling through North Africa and Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain and Portugal of the times) and seems to have acquired detailed information on both regions. He visited Anatolia when he was barely 16. He studied in the university in Córdoba.
His travels took him to many parts of Europe including Portugal, the Pyrenees, the French Atlantic coast, Hungary, and Jórvík (now known as York).

==Tabula Rogeriana==

Because of conflict and instability in Al-Andalus al-Idrisi joined contemporaries such as Abu al-Salt in Sicily, where the Normans had overthrown Arabs formerly loyal to the Fatimids.

Al-Idrisi incorporated the knowledge of Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Far East gathered by Islamic merchants and explorers and recorded on Islamic maps with the information brought by the Norman voyagers to create the most accurate map of the world in pre-modern times, which served as a concrete illustration of his &quot;Kitab nuzhat al-mushtaq&quot;, (Latin: &quot;Opus Geographicum&quot;), which may be translated &quot;A Diversion for the Man Longing to Travel to Far-Off Places&quot;.

The was drawn by al-Idrisi in 1154 for the Norman King Roger II of Sicily, after a stay of eighteen years at his court, where he worked on the commentaries and illustrations of the map. The map, with legends written in Arabic, while showing the Eurasian continent in its entirety, only shows the northern part of the African continent and lacks details of the Horn of Africa and Southeast Asia.

For Roger it was inscribed on a massive disc of solid silver, two metres in diameter.

On the geographical work of al-Idrisi, S.P. Scott wrote in 1904:

Al-Idrisi&#x27;s work influenced a number of Islamic scholars including Ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Maghribi, Hafiz-i Abru, and Ibn Khaldun but his work was unknown in Western Europe and had little influence on the development of Renaissance cartography.

===Description of islands in the North Sea===
Al-Idrisi in his famous mentioned &quot;Irlandah-al-Kabirah&quot; (Great Ireland). According to him, &quot;from the extremity of Iceland to that of Great Ireland,&quot; the sailing time was &quot;one day.&quot; Although historians note that both al-Idrisi and the Norse tend to understate distances, the only location this reference is thought to have possibly pointed to, must likely have been in Greenland.

===Description of Chinese trade===

Al-Idrisi mentioned that Chinese junks carried leather, swords, iron and silk. He mentions the glassware of the city of Hangzhou and labels Quanzhou&#x27;s silk as the best.
In his records of Chinese trade, al-Idrisi also wrote about the Silla Dynasty (one of Korea&#x27;s historical Dynasties, and a major trade partner to China at the time), and was one of the first Arabs to do so. Al-Idrisi&#x27;s References to Silla led other Arab merchants to seek Silla and its trade, and contribute to many Arab&#x27;s perception of Silla as the ideal East-Asian country.

==Nuzhat al-Mushtaq==
As well as the maps, al-Idrisi produced a compendium of geographical information with the title &quot;Kitab nuzhat al-mushtaq fi&#x27;khtiraq al-&#x27;afaq&quot;. The title has been translated as &quot;The book of pleasant journeys into faraway lands&quot; or &quot;The pleasure of him who longs to cross the horizons&quot;. It has been preserved in nine manuscripts, seven of which contain maps.

The translated title of this work (in the &quot;pleasure of him ...&quot; form) attracted favourable comment from the team selecting lists of names for features expected to be discovered by the New Horizons probe reconnoitring the Pluto system. The Al-Idrisi Montes is a geographical feature in that system named after him.

In the introduction, al-Idrisi mentions two sources for geographical coordinates: Claudius Ptolemy and &quot;an astronomer&quot; that must be Ishaq ibn al-Hasan al-Zayyat; and states that he has cross-checked oral reports from different informers to see if geographical coordinates were consistent.

===Publication and translation===

An abridged version of the Arabic text was published in Rome in 1592 with title: &quot;De geographia universali or Kitāb Nuzhat al-mushtāq fī dhikr al-amṣār wa-al-aqṭār wa-al-buldān wa-al-juzur wa-al-madā&#x27; in wa-al-āfāq&quot; which in English would be &quot;Recreation of the desirer in the account of cities, regions, countries, islands, towns, and distant lands&quot;. This was one of the first Arabic books ever printed. The first translation from the original Arabic was into Latin. The Maronites Gabriel Sionita and Joannes Hesronita translated an abridged version of the text which was published in Paris in 1619 with the title of &quot;Geographia nubiensis&quot;. Not until the middle of the 19th century was a complete translation of the Arabic text published. This was a translation into French by Pierre Amédée Jaubert. More recently sections of the text have been translated for particular regions. Beginning in 1970 a critical edition of the complete Arabic text was published.

===Andalusian-American contact===

Al-Idrisi&#x27;s geographical text, &quot;Nuzhat al-Mushtaq&quot;, is often cited by proponents of pre-Columbian Andalusian-Americas contact theories. In this text, al-Idrisi wrote the following on the Atlantic Ocean:

This translation by Professor Muhammad Hamidullah is however questionable, since it reports, after having reached an area of &quot;sticky and stinking waters&quot;, the &quot;Mugharrarin&quot; (also translated as &quot;the adventurers&quot;) moved back and first reached an uninhabited island where they found &quot;a huge quantity of sheep the meat of which was bitter and uneatable&quot; and, then, &quot;continued southward&quot; and reached the above reported island where they were soon surrounded by barques and brought to &quot;a village whose inhabitants were often fair-haired with long and flaxen hair and the women of a rare beauty&quot;. Among the villagers, one spoke Arabic and asked them where they came from. Then the king of the village ordered them to bring them back to the continent where they were surprised to be welcomed by Berbers.

Apart from the marvellous and fanciful reports of this history, the most probable interpretation is that the &quot;Mugharrarin&quot; reached the Sargasso Sea, a part of the ocean covered by seaweed, which is very close to Bermuda yet one thousand miles away from the American mainland. Then while coming back, they may have landed either on the Azores, or on Madeira or even on the westernmost Canary Island, El Hierro (because of the sheep). Last, the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on Tenerife or on Gran Canaria, where the &quot;Mugharrarin&quot; presumably met members of the Guanche tribe. This would explain why some of them could speak Arabic (some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the Canary Islands and Morocco) and why they were quickly deported to Morocco where they were welcomed by Berbers. Yet, the story reported by Idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean by Andalusians and Moroccans.

Furthermore, al-Idrisi writes an account of eight &quot;Mugharrarin&quot; all from the same family who set sail from Lisbon (&quot;Lashbuna&quot;) in the first half of that century and navigated in the seaweed rich seas beyond the Azores.

Idrisi describes an island of cormorants with which has been tentatively identified as Corvo, Azores but on weak grounds.

==Medical dictionary==
Among the lesser known works of al-Idrisi is a medical dictionary that he compiled in which he brings down a list of drugs and plants and their curative effects, used by physicians, apothecaries and merchants in his day. The list is unique, as it includes the names of drugs in as many as 12 languages (among which are Spanish, Berber, Latin, Greek and Sanskrit), including some sixty Hebrew terms transliterated into Arabic and which are thought to have been passed down to him by Andalusian Jewish informants. At the end of the section on medicinal herbs which are described under each letter of the alphabet, he gives an index of their entries. One of the books of herbal medicine frequently cited by al-Idrisi is Marwan ibn Ganah&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Talḫīṣ&quot;, who in turn had been influenced by the Andalusian physician Ibn Juljul.

==In popular culture==

<text>A radioactive tracer, radiotracer, or radioactive label is a synthetic derivative of a natural compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radionuclide (a radioactive atom). By virtue of its radioactive decay, it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. Radiolabeling or radiotracing is thus the radioactive form of isotopic labeling. In biological contexts, experiments that use radioisotope tracers are sometimes called radioisotope feeding experiments.

Radioisotopes of hydrogen, carbon, phosphorus, sulfur, and iodine have been used extensively to trace the path of biochemical reactions. A radioactive tracer can also be used to track the distribution of a substance within a natural system such as a cell or tissue, or as a flow tracer to track fluid flow. Radioactive tracers are also used to determine the location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing in natural gas production. Radioactive tracers form the basis of a variety of imaging systems, such as, PET scans, SPECT scans and technetium scans. Radiocarbon dating uses the naturally occurring carbon-14 isotope as an isotopic label.

==Methodology==
Isotopes of a chemical element differ only in the mass number. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen can be written as 1H, 2H and 3H, with the mass number superscripted to the left. When the atomic nucleus of an isotope is unstable, compounds containing this isotope are radioactive. Tritium is an example of a radioactive isotope.

The principle behind the use of radioactive tracers is that an atom in a chemical compound is replaced by another atom, of the same chemical element. The substituting atom, however, is a radioactive isotope. This process is often called radioactive labeling. The power of the technique is due to the fact that radioactive decay is much more energetic than chemical reactions. Therefore, the radioactive isotope can be present in low concentration and its presence detected by sensitive radiation detectors such as Geiger counters and scintillation counters. George de Hevesy won the 1943 Nobel Prize for Chemistry &quot;for his work on the use of isotopes as tracers in the study of chemical processes&quot;.

There are two main ways in which radioactive tracers are used
# When a labeled chemical compound undergoes chemical reactions one or more of the products will contain the radioactive label. Analysis of what happens to the radioactive isotope provides detailed information on the mechanism of the chemical reaction.
# A radioactive compound is introduced into a living organism and the radio-isotope provides a means to construct an image showing the way in which that compound and its reaction products are distributed around the organism.

== Production ==
The commonly used radioisotopes have short half lives and so do not occur in nature in large amounts. They are produced by nuclear reactions. One of the most important processes is absorption of a neutron by an atomic nucleus, in which the mass number of the element concerned increases by 1 for each neutron absorbed. For example,
:13C + n → 14C
In this case the atomic mass increases, but the element is unchanged. In other cases the product nucleus is unstable and decays, typically emitting protons, electrons (beta particle) or alpha particles. When a nucleus loses a proton the atomic number decreases by 1. For example,
:32S + n → 32P + p
Neutron irradiation is performed in a nuclear reactor. The other main method used to synthesize radioisotopes is proton bombardment. The proton are accelerated to high energy either in a cyclotron or a linear accelerator.

==Tracer isotopes==

===Hydrogen===
Tritium (hydrogen-3) is produced by neutron irradiation of 6Li:
:6Li + n → 4He + 3H
Tritium has a half-life days (approximately 12.32 years) and it decays by beta decay. The electrons produced have an average energy of 5.7 keV. Because the emitted electrons have relatively low energy, the detection efficiency by scintillation counting is rather low. However, hydrogen atoms are present in all organic compounds, so tritium is frequently used as a tracer in biochemical studies.

===Carbon===
11C decays by positron emission with a half-life of ca. 20 min. 11C is one of the isotopes often used in positron emission tomography.

14C decays by beta decay, with a half-life of 5730 years. It is continuously produced in the upper atmosphere of the earth, so it occurs at a trace level in the environment. However, it is not practical to use naturally-occurring 14C for tracer studies. Instead it is made by neutron irradiation of the isotope 13C which occurs naturally in carbon at about the 1.1% level. 14C has been used extensively to trace the progress of organic molecules through metabolic pathways.

=== Nitrogen ===
13N decays by positron emission with a half-life of 9.97 min. It is produced by the nuclear reaction
:1H + 16O → 13N + 4He
13N is used in positron emission tomography (PET scan).

=== Oxygen ===
15O decays by positron emission with a half-life of 122 seconds. It is used in positron emission tomography.

=== Fluorine ===
18F decays predominantly by β emission, with a half-life of 109.8 min. It is made by proton bombardment of 18O in a cyclotron or linear particle accelerator. It is an important isotope in the radiopharmaceutical industry. For example, it is used to make labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for application in PET scans.

===Phosphorus===
32P is made by neutron bombardment of 32S
:32S + n → 32P + p
It decays by beta decay with a half-life of 14.29 days. It is commonly used to study protein phosphorylation by kinases in biochemistry.

33P is made in relatively low yield by neutron bombardment of 31P. It is also a beta-emitter, with a half-life of 25.4 days. Though more expensive than 32P, the emitted electrons are less energetic, permitting better resolution in, for example, DNA sequencing.

Both isotopes are useful for labeling nucleotides and other species that contain a phosphate group.

===Sulfur===
35S is made by neutron bombardment of 35Cl 
:35Cl + n → 35S + p
It decays by beta-decay with a half-life of 87.51 days. It is used to label the sulfur-containing amino-acids methionine and cysteine. When a sulfur atom replaces an oxygen atom in a phosphate group on a nucleotide a thiophosphate is produced, so 35S can also be used to trace a phosphate group.

===Technetium===

99mTc is a very versatile radioisotope, and is the most commonly used radioisotope tracer in medicine. It is easy to produce in a technetium-99m generator, by decay of 99Mo.
:99Mo → 99mTc + + 
The molybdenum isotope has a half-life of approximately 66 hours (2.75 days), so the generator has a useful life of about two weeks. Most commercial 99mTc generators use column chromatography, in which 99Mo in the form of molybdate, MoO42− is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3). When the 99Mo decays it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which because of its single charge is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99Mo elutes the soluble 99mTc, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate. The pertechnetate is treated with a reducing agent such as Sn2+ and a ligand. Different ligands form coordination complexes which give the technetium enhanced affinity for particular sites in the human body.

99mTc decays by gamma emission, with a half-life: 6.01 hours. The short half-life ensures that the body-concentration of the radioisotope falls effectively to zero in a few days.

===Iodine===

123I is produced by proton irradiation of 124Xe. The caesium isotope produced is unstable and decays to 123I. The isotope is usually supplied as the iodide and hypoiodate in dilute sodium hydroxide solution, at high isotopic purity. 123I has also been produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratories by proton bombardment of 123Te.

123I decays by electron capture with a half-life of 13.22 hours. The emitted 159 keV gamma ray is used in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A 127 keV gamma ray is also emitted.

125I is frequently used in radioimmunoassays because of its relatively long half-life (59 days) and ability to be detected with high sensitivity by gamma counters.

129I is present in the environment as a result of the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. It was also produced in the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. 129I decays with a half-life of 15.7 million years, with low-energy beta and gamma emissions. It is not used as a tracer, though its presence in living organisms, including human beings, can be characterized by measurement of the gamma rays.

=== Other isotopes ===

Many other isotopes have been used in specialized radiopharmacological studies. The most widely used is 67Ga for gallium scans. 67Ga is used because, like 99mTc, it is a gamma-ray emitter and various ligands can be attached to the Ga3+ ion, forming a coordination complex which may have selective affinity for particular sites in the human body.

An extensive list of radioactive tracers used in hydraulic fracturing can be found below.

==Applications==

In metabolism research, tritium and 14C-labeled glucose are commonly used in glucose clamps to measure rates of glucose uptake, fatty acid synthesis, and other metabolic processes. While radioactive tracers are sometimes still used in human studies, stable isotope tracers such as 13C are more commonly used in current human clamp studies. Radioactive tracers are also used to study lipoprotein metabolism in humans and experimental animals.

In medicine, tracers are applied in a number of tests, such as 99mTc in autoradiography and nuclear medicine, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and scintigraphy. The urea breath test for helicobacter pylori commonly used a dose of 14C labeled urea to detect h. pylori infection. If the labeled urea was metabolized by h. pylori in the stomach, the patient&#x27;s breath would contain labeled carbon dioxide. In recent years, the use of substances enriched in the non-radioactive isotope 13C has become the preferred method, avoiding patient exposure to radioactivity.

In hydraulic fracturing, radioactive tracer isotopes are injected with hydraulic fracturing fluid to determine the injection profile and location of created fractures. Tracers with different half-lives are used for each stage of hydraulic fracturing. In the United States amounts per injection of radionuclide are listed in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidelines. According to the NRC, some of the most commonly used tracers include antimony-124, bromine-82, iodine-125, iodine-131, iridium-192, and scandium-46. A 2003 publication by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirms the frequent use of most of the tracers above, and says that manganese-56, sodium-24, technetium-99m, silver-110m, argon-41, and xenon-133 are also used extensively because they are easily identified and measured.

<text>Littleover is a village and suburb in the city of Derby, in Derbyshire, England, between Rose Hill, Normanton, Sunny Hill and Mickleover, about southwest of Derby city centre.

==History==

The history of Littleover&#x27;s name is simple. It is derived from &quot;Little Ufre&quot; (Domesday book) and in Old English &quot;ofer&quot; meant a slope or little hill, whilst neighbouring Mickleover is known to be from &quot;Mickle Ufre&quot; meaning large hill. Littleover was also formerly known as Parver Over.

The village, like many settlements in England, is partially of Saxon and partially of Roman origin; the Burton Road is a Roman road linking the A38 to the city centre. Its Roman origin is easily confirmed due to its direct route. Burton Road, the A5250, leaves the A38 as Rykneld Road and becomes Pastures Hill just past Heatherton Village. At the top of Pastures Hill it crosses a junction with Hillsway and Chain Lane, whereupon it becomes Burton Road and remains so up to its junction with Babington Lane in Derby city centre. Despite the attraction of the Burton Road–Babington Lane route, it is possible that the course of the original Rykneld Way did not deviate but continued in a straight line through the rear of what was the Crest Motel.

Littleover was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Mickleover, in 1866 Littleover became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished and merged with Derby and Findern. In 1961 the parish had a population of 11,867. It is now in the unparished area of Derby, in the Derby district.

Littleover&#x27;s main shopping area is situated around Burton Road as the village is entered from the ring road.
The village&#x27;s main public house is called the Half Moon and is notable as being one of two inns in the village in 1577; it still serves as a community hub where residents gather and socialise. The older part of the village around St Peter&#x27;s Church was built in the 14th century. The village has another public house, the White Swan which can be found on Shepherd Street also near the older part of Littleover. Directly opposite the White Swan is Church Street which takes its name from the aforementioned St Peter&#x27;s Church and links up with the Hollow which is believed to be of medieval origin. The age of the Hollow and Church Street are evidenced by the buildings that can be found there; even today the former contains the beautiful thatched roofed Littleover Cottage (very rare in Derbyshire), whilst on Church Street can be found a detached white house, which in its time has been called the White House and would probably have been there before most of the buildings around it. Residential properties in Littleover are generally attractive, well-maintained and spacious properties which are highly desired within the Derby area. The White House, it is believed, may date in part from the 16th century, whereupon it probably would have stood alone with the thatched cottage and church. In earlier times this area was the centre of activity in the village where the square was used for markets, proclamations and general celebrations on public holidays.

The Crest Hotel, built around the late 19th century on a site previously occupied by a windmill, burnt down in 2002. Today a housing development stands where the hotel used to be.

<text>was a Japanese singer, actress and cultural icon. She received a Medal of Honor for her contributions to music and for improving the welfare of the public, and was the first woman to receive the People&#x27;s Honour Award, which was conferred posthumously for giving the public hope and encouragement after World War II.

Misora recorded a total of 1,200 songs and sold 68 million records. After she died, consumer demand for her recordings grew significantly, and, by 2001, she had sold more than 80 million records. By 2019, record sales surpassed 100 million. Her swan-song is often performed by numerous artists and orchestras as a tribute to her, including notable renditions by The Three Tenors (Spanish/Italian), Teresa Teng (Taiwanese) and Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan (Mexican).

Each year there is a special on Japanese television and radio featuring her songs. A memorial concert for Misora was held at the Tokyo Dome on November 11, 2012. It featured numerous musicians such as Ai, Koda Kumi, Ken Hirai, Kiyoshi Hikawa, Exile, AKB48 and Nobuyasu Okabayashi amongst others, paying tribute by singing her most famous songs.

== Biography ==
=== Life and career ===
Misora was born on May 29, 1937 in Isogo-ku, Yokohama, Japan. Her father, , was a fishmonger and her mother, , a housewife. Katō displayed musical talent from an early age after singing for her father at a World War II send-off party in 1943 at the age of six. Masukichi invested a small fortune from the family&#x27;s savings to begin a musical career for his daughter. In 1945, at the age of eight, Kazue made her debut at a concert hall in Yokohama. At that time, she changed her surname from Katō to , at the suggestion of her mother. 

In 1946, at the age of nine, entered the NHK Nodo Jiman singing competition. Judges did not pass her because they felt her voice was too mature and that it was inappropriate for a child to sing an adult song. Later that year, she appeared on another NHK broadcast, and this time impressed Japanese composer Masao Koga with her singing ability. He considered her to be a child prodigy with the courage, understanding, and emotional maturity of an adult. Over the next few years, Misora became an accomplished singer and toured notable concert halls to sold-out crowds. While the general public loved her, she was criticized by the social and cultural elites for sounding too much like a grown woman and for singing boogie woogies and love songs rather than children&#x27;s songs.

Kazue began her recording career in 1949 at the age of 12, now with the name , which means &quot;lark in the beautiful sky,&quot; and starred in the film . The film gained her nationwide recognition. That same year, she recorded her first single for Nippon Columbia. It became a commercial hit, selling more than 450,000 copies. She subsequently recorded &quot;Kanashiki kuchibue&quot;, which was featured on a radio program and was a national hit. 

As an actress, Misora starred in more than 150 movies between 1949 and 1971, and won numerous awards. Her performance in &quot;Tokyo Kid&quot; (1950), in which she played a street orphan, made her symbolic of both the hardship and the national optimism of post-World War II Japan.

In June 1950, Misora was one of the first entertainers from Japan to visit the United States after the war. She performed in Hawaii and California.

In 1956, Misora was briefly engaged to musician Mitsuru Ono. Their engagement was called off when Misora was told she would have to give up her career in order to marry.

On January 13, 1957, Misora was attacked and injured with hydrochloric acid at Asakusa International Theater. The suspect was identified as a fanatical admirer of hers.

In 1962, Misora married actor Akira Kobayashi. They divorced in 1964, and she never remarried. Her mother, who had been opposed to the marriage, later stated that the unhappiest moment in her life was when her daughter married Kobayashi and the happiest moment was when they divorced.

Between 1949 and 1971, Misora appeared in 8 to 12 films per year, usually with top billing. These films ranged from light contemporary romances to period films with sword-fighting action. In many of her period films, she was cast either in male roles or in female roles disguised as men. After she ended her film career, Misora sometimes sang in male drag in her many television performances.

In 1973, Misora&#x27;s younger brother, Tetsuya Katō, was prosecuted for gang-related activity. Although NHK did not acknowledge any connection, Misora was excluded from &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; for the first time in 18 years. Offended, she refused to appear on any NHK programs for years afterwards. Nevertheless, Misora eventually did make peace with NHK and appeared in the 1979 Kōhaku as a special guest. This was her final appearance on the program. Misora appeared occasionally on other NHK programs, but felt she no longer had a reason to perform on Kōhaku.

In 1978, Misora adopted her seven-year-old nephew, Tetsuya&#x27;s son Kazuya Katō.

In 1980, on the 35th year anniversary of her debut, Misora performed a recital at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo.

=== Illness and death ===
The 1980s were incredibly difficult years for Misora. Her mother passed away in 1981 and a year later her best friend, fellow singer and actress Chiemi Eri, died. Misora’s brothers both died in 1983 and 1986, respectively. Misora and her mother had been extremely close; not only had Kimie been her daughter&#x27;s number one fan, but also she had worked as Misora&#x27;s producer/manager throughout her career. To cope with her sorrow, Misora, having already been known as a hard drinker, increased her drinking and smoking even further.

In April 1987, Misora suddenly collapsed on stage at a concert performance in Fukuoka. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she was diagnosed with avascular necrosis brought on by chronic hepatitis. Doctors did not reveal to the press that she was also suffering from cirrhosis so as to not cause worry to her fans and associates. She was immediately admitted, but eventually showed signs of recovery in August. She commenced recording a new song in October, and in April 1988 performed at her comeback concert at Tokyo Dome. At the time, the audience was unaware that she had still not fully recovered and spent her backstage time lying in a bed with an oxygen tank. Despite overwhelming pain in her legs, Misora performed a total of 40 songs. Once off the stage after the last song, she collapsed and was taken away by an ambulance that was on standby.

Misora&#x27;s health improvement was to be temporary, as her liver weakened from decades of heavy drinking and her condition worsened. Yet, she continued to perform live while hiding the true nature of her health from her fans. On February 7, 1989 (less than a month after the Heisei period began), Misora held her final concert in Kokura. It was the start of a nationwide tour which had to be cancelled due to her failing health. On March 21, she wrapped up her nearly four-and-a-half-decade career with a 10-hour live radio show for Nippon Broadcasting System. She was later hospitalized at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo with interstitial pneumonitis.

On the morning of June 24, 1989, Misora died at Juntendo. She was 52. Her death was widely mourned throughout Japan and many felt the Shōwa period had truly come to an end. The major television networks had to cancel their regular programming that evening to bring the news of her death and instead aired various tributes.

=== Legacy ===
In 1993, a monument depicting Misora&#x27;s portrait with an inscribed poem was erected in her memory near Sugi no Osugi in Ōtoyo, Kōchi. In 1947, a 10-year old Misora had been involved in a serious bus collision in Ōtoyo. While recovering from her injuries, she remained in the town and reportedly visited Sugi no Osugi and wished to become the top singer in Japan. Misora’s father was so upset, he demanded that she stopped singing. The young Misora responded “If I can’t sing, then I will die.” She eventually returned to Tokyo, where she began her recording career in 1949 at the age of 12.

In 1994, the &quot;Hibari Misora Museum&quot; opened in Arashiyama, Kyoto. This multi-story museum complex traced the history of Misora&#x27;s life and career in various multimedia exhibits, and displayed various memorabilia. It attracted more than 5 million visitors, until it closed down November 30, 2006 as to allow a scheduled renovation of the building. The main exhibits were relocated to the Shōwa period section of the Edo-Tokyo Museum, until a renovation was completed. The brand new &quot;Hibari Misora Theater&quot; opened in its place on April 26, 2008, and includes a CD for sale of a previously unreleased song. A bronze statue of her debut was built as a memorial in Yokohama in 2002 and attracts around 300,000 visitors per year.

Beginning in 1990, television and radio stations play Misora&#x27;s song annually on her birth date to show respect. In a national poll by NHK in 1997, the song was voted the greatest Japanese song of all time by more than 10 million people. The song is still prominently performed by numerous artists and orchestras as a tribute to Misora, including notable renditions by The Three Tenors (Spanish/Italian), Teresa Teng (Taiwanese), Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan (Mexican) and Twelve Girls Band (Chinese).

On November 11, 2012, a memorial concert for Misora was held at the Tokyo Dome. It featured numerous musicians such as Ai, Koda Kumi, Ken Hirai, Kiyoshi Hikawa, Exile, AKB48 and Nobuyasu Okabayashi amongst others, paying tribute to Misora by covering her most famous songs.

In September 2019, Misora&#x27;s voice became focused on after was used for a version of the Vocaloid engine known as &quot;VOCALOID:AI&quot;, which tried to recreate her singing vocals. The Vocaloid performance also used a full 3D rendering of the singer.

After Misora&#x27;s death in 1989, a TBS television drama special aired later that same year under the title &quot;The Hibari Misora Story&quot; (), starring Kayoko Kishimoto as Misora. In 2005, also on TBS, Aya Ueto portrayed Misora in &quot;The Hibari Misora Birth Story&quot; ().

<text>The calculus of communicating systems (CCS) is a process calculus introduced by Robin Milner around 1980 and the title of a book describing the calculus. Its actions model indivisible communications between exactly two participants. The formal language includes primitives for describing parallel composition, summation between actions and scope restriction. CCS is useful for evaluating the qualitative correctness of properties of a system such as deadlock or livelock.

According to Milner, &quot;There is nothing canonical about the choice of the basic combinators, even though they were chosen with great attention to economy. What characterises our calculus is not the exact choice of combinators, but rather the choice of interpretation and of mathematical framework&quot;.

The expressions of the language are interpreted as a labelled transition system. Between these models, bisimilarity is used as a semantic equivalence.

==Syntax==

Given a set of action names, the set of CCS processes is defined by the following BNF grammar:

:formula_1

The parts of the syntax are, in the order given above

; inactive process : the inactive process formula_2 is a valid CCS process
; action : the process formula_3 can perform an action formula_4 and continue as the process formula_5
; process identifier : write formula_6 to use the identifier formula_7 to refer to the process formula_5 (which may contain the identifier formula_7 itself, i.e., recursive definitions are allowed)
; summation : the process formula_10 can proceed either as the process formula_5 or the process formula_12
; parallel composition : formula_13 tells that processes formula_5 and formula_12 exist simultaneously
; renaming : formula_16 is the process formula_5 with all actions named formula_4 renamed as formula_19
; restriction : formula_20 is the process formula_5 without action formula_4

==Related calculi, models, and languages==
* Communicating sequential processes (CSP), developed by Tony Hoare, is a formal language that arose at a similar time to CCS.
* The Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP) was developed by Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop in 1982, and uses an axiomatic approach (in the style of Universal algebra) to reason about a similar class of processes as CCS.
* The pi-calculus, developed by Robin Milner, Joachim Parrow, and David Walker in the late 80&#x27;s extends CCS with mobility of communication links, by allowing processes to communicate the names of communication channels themselves.
* PEPA, developed by Jane Hillston introduces activity timing in terms of exponentially distributed rates and probabilistic choice, allowing performance metrics to be evaluated.
* Reversible Communicating Concurrent Systems (RCCS) introduced by Vincent Danos, Jean Krivine, and others, introduces (partial) reversibility in the execution of CCS processes.

Some other languages based on CCS:
* Calculus of broadcasting systems
* Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification (LOTOS)
* Process Calculus for Spatially-Explicit Ecological Models (PALPS) is an extension of CCS with probabilistic choice, locations and attributes for locations
*Java Orchestration Language Interpreter Engine (Jolie)

Models that have been used in the study of CCS-like systems:
* History monoid
* Actor model

<text>In theoretical computer science, the -calculus (or pi-calculus) is a process calculus. The -calculus allows channel names to be communicated along the channels themselves, and in this way it is able to describe concurrent computations whose network configuration may change during the computation.

The -calculus has few terms and is a small, yet expressive language (see ). Functional programs can be encoded into the -calculus, and the encoding emphasises the dialogue nature of computation, drawing connections with game semantics. Extensions of the -calculus, such as the spi calculus and applied , have been successful in reasoning about cryptographic protocols. Beside the original use in describing concurrent systems, the -calculus has also been used to reason about business processes and molecular biology.

== Informal definition ==
The -calculus belongs to the family of process calculi, mathematical formalisms for describing and analyzing properties of concurrent computation. In fact, the -calculus, like the λ-calculus, is so minimal that it does not contain primitives such as numbers, booleans, data structures, variables, functions, or even the usual control flow statements (such as codice_1, codice_2).

=== Process constructs ===

Central to the -calculus is the notion of &quot;name&quot;. The simplicity of the calculus lies in the dual role that names play as &quot;communication channels&quot; and &quot;variables&quot;.

The process constructs available in the calculus are the following (a precise definition is given in the following section):

* &quot;concurrency&quot;, written formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 are two processes or threads executed concurrently.
* &quot;communication&quot;, where
** &quot;input prefixing&quot; formula_4 is a process waiting for a message that was sent on a communication channel named formula_5 before proceeding as binding the name received to the name Typically, this models either a process expecting a communication from the network or a label codice_3 usable only once by a codice_4 operation.
** &quot;output prefixing&quot; formula_6 describes that the name formula_7 is emitted on channel formula_5 before proceeding as Typically, this models either sending a message on the network or a codice_4 operation.
* &quot;replication&quot;, written formula_9, which may be seen as a process which can always create a new copy of Typically, this models either a network service or a label codice_3 waiting for any number of codice_4 operations.
* &quot;creation of a new name&quot;, written formula_10, which may be seen as a process allocating a new constant within The constants of are defined by their names only and are always communication channels. Creation of a new name in a process is also called &quot;restriction&quot;.
* the nil process, written formula_11, is a process whose execution is complete and has stopped.

Although the minimalism of the -calculus prevents us from writing programs in the normal sense, it is easy to extend the calculus. In particular, it is easy to define both control structures such as recursion, loops and sequential composition and datatypes such as first-order functions, truth values, lists and integers. Moreover, extensions of the have been proposed which take into account distribution or public-key cryptography. The &quot;applied &quot; due to Abadi and Fournet put these various extensions on a formal footing by extending the with arbitrary datatypes.

=== A small example ===

Below is a tiny example of a process which consists of three parallel components. The channel name is only known by the first two components.

:formula_12

The first two components are able to communicate on the channel , and the name becomes bound to . The next step in the process is therefore

:formula_13

Note that the remaining is not affected because it is defined in an inner scope.
The second and third parallel components can now communicate on the channel name , and the name becomes bound to . The next step in the process is now

:formula_14

Note that since the local name has been output, the scope of is extended to cover the third component as well. Finally, the channel can be used for sending the name . After that all concurrently executing processes have stopped

:formula_15

== Formal definition ==

=== Syntax ===

Let Χ be a set of objects called &quot;names&quot;. The abstract syntax for the -calculus is built from the following BNF grammar (where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are any names from Χ):

:formula_16
In the concrete syntax below, the prefixes bind more tightly than the parallel composition (|), and parentheses are used to disambiguate.

Names are bound by the restriction and input prefix constructs. Formally, the set of free names of a process in –calculus are defined inductively by the table below. The set of bound names of a process are defined as the names of a process that are not in the set of free names.
=== Structural congruence ===

Central to both the reduction semantics and the labelled transition semantics is the notion of structural congruence. Two processes are structurally congruent, if they are identical up to structure. In particular, parallel composition is commutative and associative.

More precisely, structural congruence is defined as the least equivalence relation preserved by the process constructs and satisfying:

&quot;Alpha-conversion&quot;:

:* formula_17 if formula_3 can be obtained from formula_2 by renaming one or more bound names in formula_2.

&quot;Axioms for parallel composition&quot;:

:* formula_21
:* formula_22
:*formula_23

&quot;Axioms for restriction&quot;:

:* formula_24
:* formula_25

&quot;Axiom for replication&quot;:

:* formula_26

&quot;Axiom relating restriction and parallel&quot;:

:* formula_27 if is not a free name of formula_3.

This last axiom is known as the &quot;scope extension&quot; axiom. This axiom is central, since it describes how a bound name may be extruded by an output action, causing the scope of to be extended. In cases where is a free name of formula_3, alpha-conversion may be used to allow extension to proceed.

=== Reduction semantics ===

We write formula_30 if formula_2 can perform a computation step, following which it is now formula_32.
This &quot;reduction relation&quot; formula_33 is defined as the least relation closed under a set of reduction rules.

The main reduction rule which captures the ability of processes to communicate through channels is the following:
* formula_34
: where formula_35 denotes the process formula_3 in which the free name formula_37 has been &quot;substituted&quot; for the free occurrences of formula_7. If a free occurrence of formula_7 occurs in a location where formula_37 would not be free, alpha-conversion may be required.

There are three additional rules:
* If formula_41 then also formula_42.
: This rule says that parallel composition does not inhibit computation.
* If formula_41, then also formula_44.
: This rule ensures that computation can proceed underneath a restriction.
* If formula_45 and formula_46 and formula_47, then also formula_41.

The latter rule states that processes that are structurally congruent have the same reductions.

=== The example revisited ===

Consider again the process

:formula_49

Applying the definition of the reduction semantics, we get the reduction

:formula_50

Note how, applying the reduction substitution axiom, free occurrences of formula_7 are now labeled as formula_37.

Next, we get the reduction

:formula_53

Note that since the local name has been output, the scope of is extended to cover the third component as well. This was captured using the scope extension axiom.

Next, using the reduction substitution axiom, we get

:formula_54

Finally, using the axioms for parallel composition and restriction, we get

:formula_55

=== Labelled semantics ===

Alternatively, one may give the pi-calculus a labelled transition semantics (as has been done with the Calculus of Communicating Systems). 
In this semantics, a transition from a state formula_2 to some other state formula_32 after an action formula_58 is notated as: 
*formula_59
Where states formula_2 and formula_32 represent processes and formula_58 is either an &quot;input action&quot; formula_63, an &quot;output action&quot; &quot;formula_64&quot;, or a &quot;silent action&quot; .

A standard result about the labelled semantics is that it agrees with the reduction semantics up to structural congruence, in the sense that 
formula_30 if and only if 
formula_66 

== Extensions and variants ==

The syntax given above is a minimal one. However, the syntax may be modified in various ways.

A &quot;nondeterministic choice operator&quot; formula_67 can be added to the syntax.

A test for &quot;name equality&quot; formula_68 can be added to the syntax. This &quot;match operator&quot; can proceed as formula_2 if and only if and formula_7 are the same name.
Similarly, one may add a &quot;mismatch operator&quot; for name inequality. Practical programs which can pass names (URLs or pointers) often use such functionality: for directly modeling such functionality inside the calculus, this and related extensions are often useful.

The &quot;asynchronous -calculus&quot;
allows only outputs with no continuation, i.e. output atoms of the form formula_71, yielding a smaller calculus. However, any process in the original calculus can be represented by the smaller asynchronous -calculus using an extra channel to simulate explicit acknowledgement from the receiving process. Since a continuation-free output can model a message-in-transit, this fragment shows that the original -calculus, which is intuitively based on synchronous communication, has an expressive asynchronous communication model inside its syntax. However, the nondeterministic choice operator defined above cannot be expressed in this way, as an unguarded choice would be converted into a guarded one; this fact has been used to demonstrate that the asynchronous calculus is strictly less expressive than the synchronous one (with the choice operator).

The &quot;polyadic -calculus&quot; allows communicating more than one name in a single action: formula_72 &quot;(polyadic output)&quot; and formula_73 &quot;(polyadic input)&quot;. This polyadic extension, which is useful especially when studying types for name passing processes, can be encoded in the monadic calculus by passing the name of a private channel through which the multiple arguments are then passed in sequence. The encoding is defined recursively by the clauses

formula_74 is encoded as formula_75

formula_76 is encoded as formula_77

All other process constructs are left unchanged by the encoding.

In the above, formula_78 denotes the encoding of all prefixes in the continuation formula_2 in the same way.

The full power of replication formula_80 is not needed. Often, one only considers &quot;replicated input&quot; formula_81, whose structural congruence axiom is formula_82.

Replicated input process such as formula_83 can be understood as servers, waiting on channel
 to be invoked by clients. Invocation of a server spawns a new copy of
the process formula_84, where a is the name passed by the client to the
server, during the latter&#x27;s invocation.

A &quot;higher order -calculus&quot; can be defined where not only names but processes are sent through channels.
The key reduction rule for the higher order case is

formula_85

Here, formula_86 denotes a &quot;process variable&quot; which can be instantiated by a process term. Sangiorgi
established that the ability to pass processes does not
increase the expressivity of the -calculus: passing a process &quot;P&quot; can be
simulated by just passing a name that points to &quot;P&quot; instead.

== Properties ==

=== Turing completeness ===

The -calculus is a universal model of computation. This was first observed by Milner in his paper &quot;Functions as Processes&quot;, in which he presents two encodings of the lambda-calculus in the -calculus. One encoding simulates the eager (call-by-value) evaluation strategy, the other encoding simulates the normal-order (call-by-name) strategy. In both of these, the crucial insight is the modeling of environment bindings – for instance, &quot; is bound to term formula_87&quot; – as replicating agents that respond to requests for their bindings by sending back a connection to the term formula_88.

The features of the -calculus that make these encodings possible are name-passing and replication (or, equivalently, recursively defined agents). In the absence of replication/recursion, the -calculus ceases to be Turing-complete. This can be seen by the fact that bisimulation equivalence becomes decidable for the recursion-free calculus and even for the finite-control -calculus where the number of parallel components in any process is bounded by a constant.

== Bisimulations in the -calculus ==

As for process calculi, the -calculus allows for a definition of bisimulation equivalence. In the -calculus, the definition of bisimulation equivalence (also known as bisimilarity) may be based on either the reduction semantics or on the labelled transition semantics.

There are (at least) three different ways of defining &quot;labelled bisimulation equivalence&quot; in the -calculus: Early, late and open bisimilarity. This stems from the fact that the -calculus is a value-passing process calculus.

In the remainder of this section, we let formula_89 and formula_90 denote processes and formula_91 denote binary relations over processes.

=== Early and late bisimilarity ===

Early and late bisimilarity were both formulated by Milner, Parrow and Walker in their original paper on the -calculus.

A binary relation formula_91 over processes is an &quot;early bisimulation&quot; if for every pair of processes formula_93,
* whenever formula_94 then for every name formula_7 there exists some formula_96 such that formula_97 and formula_98;
* for any non-input action formula_58, if formula_100 then there exists some formula_96 such that formula_102 and formula_103;
* and symmetric requirements with formula_89 and formula_90 interchanged.

Processes formula_89 and formula_90 are said to be early bisimilar, written formula_108 if the pair formula_109 for some early bisimulation formula_91.

In late bisimilarity, the transition match must be independent of the name being transmitted.
A binary relation formula_91 over processes is a &quot;late bisimulation&quot; if for every pair of processes formula_93,
* whenever formula_113 then for some formula_96 it holds that formula_115 and formula_98 &quot;for every name y&quot;;
*for any non-input action formula_58, if formula_118 implies that there exists some formula_96 such that formula_102and formula_103;
* and symmetric requirements with formula_89 and formula_90 interchanged.
Processes formula_89 and formula_90 are said to be late bisimilar, written formula_126 if the pair formula_109 for some late bisimulation formula_91.

Both formula_129 and formula_130 suffer from the problem that they are not &quot;congruence relations&quot; in the sense that they are not preserved by all process constructs. More precisely, there exist processes formula_89 and formula_90 such that formula_108 but formula_134. One may remedy this problem by considering the maximal congruence relations included in formula_129 and formula_130, known as &quot;early congruence&quot; and &quot;late congruence&quot;, respectively.

=== Open bisimilarity ===

Fortunately, a third definition is possible, which avoids this problem, namely that of &quot;open bisimilarity&quot;, due to Sangiorgi.

A binary relation formula_91 over processes is an &quot;open bisimulation&quot; if for every pair of elements formula_93 and for every name substitution formula_139 and every action formula_58, whenever formula_141 then there exists some formula_96 such that formula_143 and formula_103.

Processes formula_89 and formula_90 are said to be open bisimilar, written formula_147 if the pair formula_109 for some open bisimulation formula_91.

==== Early, late and open bisimilarity are distinct ====

Early, late and open bisimilarity are distinct. The containments are proper, so formula_150.

In certain subcalculi such as the asynchronous pi-calculus, late, early and open bisimilarity are known to coincide. However, in this setting a more appropriate notion is that of &quot;asynchronous bisimilarity&quot;.
In the literature, the term &quot;open bisimulation&quot; usually refers to a more sophisticated notion, where processes and relations are indexed by distinction relations; details are in Sangiorgi&#x27;s paper cited above.

=== Barbed equivalence ===

Alternatively, one may define bisimulation equivalence directly from the reduction semantics. We write formula_151 if process formula_89 immediately allows an input or an output on name formula_153.

A binary relation formula_91 over processes is a &quot;barbed bisimulation&quot; if it is a symmetric relation which satisfies that for every pair of elements formula_93 we have that

:(1) formula_151 if and only if formula_157 for every name formula_153

and

:(2) for every reduction formula_159 there exists a reduction formula_160

such that formula_103.

We say that formula_89 and formula_90 are &quot;barbed bisimilar&quot; if there exists a barbed bisimulation formula_91 where formula_109.

Defining a context as a term with a hole [] we say that two processes P and Q are &quot;barbed congruent&quot;, written formula_166, if for every context formula_167 we have that formula_168 and formula_169 are barbed bisimilar. It turns out that barbed congruence coincides with the congruence induced by early bisimilarity.

== Applications ==

The -calculus has been used to describe many different kinds of concurrent systems. In fact, some of the most recent applications lie outside the realm of traditional computer science.

In 1997, Martin Abadi and Andrew Gordon proposed an extension of the -calculus, the Spi-calculus, as a formal notation for describing and reasoning about cryptographic protocols. The spi-calculus extends the -calculus with primitives for encryption and decryption. In 2001, Martin Abadi and Cedric Fournet generalised the handling of cryptographic protocols to produce the applied calculus. There is now a large body of work devoted to variants of the applied calculus, including a number of experimental verification tools. One example is the tool ProVerif due to Bruno Blanchet, based on a translation of the applied -calculus into Blanchet&#x27;s logic programming framework. Another example is Cryptyc , due to Andrew Gordon and Alan Jeffrey, which uses Woo and Lam&#x27;s method of correspondence assertions as the basis for type systems that can check for authentication properties of cryptographic protocols.

Around 2002, Howard Smith and Peter Fingar became interested that -calculus would become a description tool for modeling business processes. By July 2006, there is discussion in the community about how useful this would be. Most recently, the -calculus has formed the theoretical basis of Business Process Modeling Language (BPML), and of Microsoft&#x27;s XLANG.

The -calculus has also attracted interest in molecular biology. In 1999, Aviv Regev and Ehud Shapiro showed that one can describe a cellular signaling pathway (the so-called RTK/MAPK cascade) and in particular the molecular &quot;lego&quot; which implements these tasks of communication in an extension of the -calculus. Following this seminal paper, other authors described the whole metabolic network of a minimal cell. In 2009, Anthony Nash and Sara Kalvala proposed a -calculus framework to model the signal transduction that directs &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; aggregation.

== History ==
The -calculus was originally developed by Robin Milner, Joachim Parrow and David Walker in 1992, based on ideas by Uffe Engberg and Mogens Nielsen. It can be seen as a continuation of Milner&#x27;s work on the process calculus CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems). In his Turing lecture, Milner describes the development of the -calculus as an attempt to capture the uniformity of values and processes in actors.

== Implementations ==

The following programming languages implement the -calculus or one of its variants:

* Business Process Modeling Language (BPML)
* occam-π
* Pict
* JoCaml (based on the Join-calculus)
* RhoLang

<text>Calculus of broadcasting systems (CBS) is a CCS-like calculus where processes speak one at a time and each is heard instantaneously by all others. Speech is autonomous, contention between speakers being resolved nondeterministically, but hearing only happens when someone else speaks. Observationally meaningful laws differ from those of CCS. The handshake communication of CCS is changed to broadcast communication in CBS. This allows several additional features:

# Priority, which attaches only to autonomous actions, is simply added to CBS in contrast to CCS, where such actions are the result of communication.
# A CBS simulator runs a process by returning a list of values it broadcasts. This permits a powerful combination, CBS with the host language. It yields several elegant algorithms. Only processes with a unique response to each input are needed in practice, so weak bi simulation is a congruence.
# CBS subsystems are interfaced by translators; by mapping messages to silence, these can restrict hearing and hide speech. Reversing a translator turns its scope inside out. This permits a new specification for a communication link – the environment of each user should behave like the other user.

<doc id="420376" wikidata="Q313081" url="?curid=420376" title="Kyu Sakamoto">
<text>, legally registered as since 1956, was a Japanese singer and actor.

He was best known outside Japan for his international hit song &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; (known as &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; in English-speaking markets), which was sung in Japanese and sold over 13 million copies. It reached number one in the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1963, making Sakamoto the first Asian recording artist to have a number one song on the chart. He was also the first Japanese artist to have a number one single on the Australian singles chart.

Sakamoto died on 12 August 1985 in the crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123, along with 519 others on board the flight, making him a casualty of the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history. Only four people on board survived the crash.

==Life and career==

===Early years: 1941–1949===

==== Childhood in Kawasaki and Kasama ====
Sakamoto was born on 10 December 1941, in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, to Hiroshi Sakamoto, a cargo tender officer, and his second wife, Iku. The youngest of his father&#x27;s nine children, he was nicknamed , meaning &quot;Lil Nine&quot;, with &quot;Kyū&quot; also being an alternative reading of the &quot;kanji&quot; of his given name, .

In the summer of 1944, during the air raids over the greater Tokyo area, Kyu&#x27;s mother took her three children to live with their maternal grandparents in rural Kasama, Ibaraki Prefecture. They moved back to Kawasaki in 1949. Their father&#x27;s company had been closed by the American occupation forces and he opened a restaurant.

===1956–1958===

====Teenage life====
In 1956, Kyu&#x27;s parents divorced. His mother was given custody over her three minor children including Kyu, and they adopted the mother&#x27;s maiden name, Ōshima. His older half-siblings kept their father&#x27;s surname, Sakamoto. Kyu started playing guitar in high school, but he soon began singing.
===First recordings (1959–1960)===
====JVC and Toshiba Records====
In May 1958, when Sakamoto was 16 years old, he joined the Japanese pop-band The Drifters that had been formed three years earlier. Sakamoto was unhappy about his position in the band as second vocalist, and this often led to fights with the other members. His big breakthrough as a band member came 26 August 1958, when he sang at the annual music festival Western Carnival at the Nichigeki Hall. After a quarrel that ended in a fight with two of the other members, Sakamoto left the band in November 1958.

For a short period of time, Sakamoto returned to his studies and focused on entering university. By December 1958, he joined his classmate&#x27;s Hisahiko Iida&#x27;s band called Danny Iida and Paradise King. He replaced Hiroshi Mizuhara as singer. Sakamoto&#x27;s career began to rise to expectations, where he ended his studies and left school. In June 1959, the band got a record deal at the JVC record company. The Paradise King and Sakamoto released their song &quot;Kanashiki Rokujissai&quot; in August 1960, which became a great hit. In the time after they released a number of songs that became very popular. This led to Sakamoto obtaining a record deal at the Toshiba Records company and left the Paradise King aiming at a solo career.

===Solo career (1961–1985)===
====Debut album and international success (1961–1964)====

Sakamoto&#x27;s solo career was inaugurated with the song &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; written by Rokusuke Ei and Hachidai Nakamura. The song was first heard on the NHK entertainment program &quot;Yume de Aimashō&quot; on 16 August 1961. It became a smash hit and was released on red vinyl on October 15. It remained the highest selling record until January 1962, three months after its release.

His international breakthrough came in 1963 during a visit to Japan by Louis Benjamin, an executive of British record company Pye Records. Hearing the song several times, Benjamin decided to bring it back to England. Due to concerns that the title would be too hard for English-speakers to pronounce or remember, the song was renamed &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, after the Japanese cooked beef dish familiar to the English. The new title was intended to sound both catchy and distinctive in Japanese, but other than the language, it had no actual connection to the song.

Initially, Pye Records released an instrumental version of the song recorded by Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen. After that became a hit in England, His Master&#x27;s Voice released the original, which also sold well, reaching sixth place in the label&#x27;s most sold records. In 1963, Capitol Records released the song in the US with the alternate title, eventually selling over one million copies, and remaining number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one single for three weeks in June 1963.

After the international success of &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot;, Sakamoto went on a world tour that lasted from summer of 1963 to the beginning of 1964. Among the countries he visited were the United States (including Hawaii), Germany, and Sweden. During his time in the U.S., he was invited to appear in several television shows. On 13 August 1963, he landed at Los Angeles International Airport and that evening, was a guest of television program &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. Sakamoto was also expected to appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; but his appearance was canceled owing to a scheduling conflict with the production of his upcoming movie, &quot;Kyu-chan Katana o Nuite&quot;.

Sakamoto had only one other song reach the U.S. charts, &quot;China Nights (Shina no Yoru)&quot; (Capitol 5016), which peaked at number 58 in 1963. His only American album, &quot;Sukiyaki and Other Japanese Hits&quot; (Capitol 10349), peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart (now known as the Billboard 200) in 1963 and remained on the Pop Albums chart for 17 weeks.

He received his sole foreign Gold Record of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) by Capitol Records on 15 May 1964 in Hotel Okura, Tokyo.

====Later appearances====
During the 1964 Summer Olympics, he was featured on the Swedish TV-program &quot;Hylands hörna&quot; broadcast live from Tokyo.

In 1968, Sakamoto and Hachidai Nakamura participated in the Festival Internacional da Canção in Rio de Janeiro with the song &quot;Sayonara, Sayonara&quot; and finished in 7th place.

===Marriage and family===
In 1971, Sakamoto married Japanese actress Yukiko Kashiwagi. The couple had two daughters, Hanako and .

===Death===

On August 12, 1985, Sakamoto was aboard Japan Air Lines Flight 123 (departing from Tokyo), heading to Osaka for an event. The plane suffered a severe structural failure and decompression before crashing into two ridges of Mount Takamagahara in Ueno, Gunma, a disaster that remains the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history with 520 people killed, including Sakamoto. He was interred at Chōkoku-ji Temple in the central Minato-ku area in Tokyo.

==Legacy==
His most popular song, &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; (&quot;I look up when I walk&quot;) is the only Japanese song to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts in the United States, a position it maintained for three weeks in 1963. It was also the first-ever Japanese language song to enter the Australian charts, where it reached #2. In addition, it made the UK charts, though it only climbed to number 6 with no further chart entries.

&quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; has been covered multiple times over the years, beginning with the instrumental by Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen. &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; was also covered as an instrumental, by English pianist Johnny Pearson, during 1982. Well-known English-language cover versions include a 1981 cover by A Taste of Honey and a 1995 cover by 4 P.M., both of which made the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. In 1989, Selena&#x27;s &quot;self-titled album&quot; contained a Spanish translation of the Taste of Honey cover which was released as a single in 1990. The English lyrics have also appeared in whole or in part in songs by performers including Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh (1985&#x27;s &quot;La Di Da Di&quot;), Salt-N-Pepa (1985&#x27;s &quot;The Show Stopper&quot;), Snoop Dogg (1993&#x27;s &quot;Lodi Dodi&quot;, a &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; cover), Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (1995&#x27;s &quot;Bless Da 40 Oz.&quot;), Raphael Saadiq (1995&#x27;s &quot;Ask of You&quot;, another to make the Hot 100), Mary J. Blige (1997&#x27;s &quot;Everything&quot;) and Will Smith (1999&#x27;s &quot;So Fresh&quot;, featuring Slick Rick).

An American version by Jewel Akens with different English lyrics was written for it. Titled &quot;My First Lonely Night (Sukiyaki)&quot; in 1966, the song reached number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

On 16 March 1999, Japan Post issued a stamp commemorating Sakamoto and &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot;. The stamp is listed in the Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue as Japan number 2666 with a face value of 50 yen.
On 15 October 2020, Google celebrated his song &quot;Ue o Muite Aruko&quot; and Sakamoto with a Google Doodle.

<text>Stavanger Cathedral () is Norway&#x27;s oldest cathedral and the seat of the Bishop of Stavanger who leads the Diocese of Stavanger in the Church of Norway. It is located in the centre of the city of Stavanger which lies in the southwestern part of the large Stavanger Municipality in central Rogaland county, Norway. The church is situated in the centre of the city, in the borough of Storhaug between Breiavatnet in the south, the square with Vågen in the north west, the cathedral square in the north, and Kongsgård in the southwest.

It is one of the two churches for the Domkirken og St. Petri parish which is part of the Stavanger domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The gray, stone church was built in a long church style around the year 1125 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 800 people.

==History==
Bishop Reinald, who may have come from Winchester in England, is said to have started construction of the cathedral around 1100. It was finished around 1150: the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its year of foundation. The cathedral was dedicated to Saint Swithun, an early Bishop of Winchester and subsequently patron saint of Winchester Cathedral. The church was initially the seat of the Diocese of Stavanger within the Roman Catholic Church until the Protestant Reformation.

The church building originally had a wooden, rectangular nave with a narrower, rectangular, straight-ended and probably lower chancel. To the west it had a tall tower. The city of Stavanger was ravaged by fire in 1272, and the cathedral suffered heavy damage. It was rebuilt under Bishop Arne (1276–1303) at which time the Romanesque cathedral was enlarged in the Gothic style. The west tower was replaced after the fire with a vestibule with a somewhat larger base. The choir was newly built and extended, but the original width was maintained. Its east façade was erected with two corner towers and a large window. The Romanesque choir had crypts beneath it.

In 1682, King Christian V decided to move Stavanger&#x27;s episcopal seat to the town of Kristiansand at the Kristiansand Cathedral. However, on Stavanger&#x27;s 800th anniversary in 1925, King Haakon VII re-created the Diocese of Stavanger and appointed Jacob Christian Petersen (1870-1964) to serve as Stavanger&#x27;s first bishop in nearly 250 years.

During a renovation of the building in the 1860s, the cathedral&#x27;s exterior and interior were considerably altered. The stone walls were plastered, and the building lost much of its medieval appearance. A major restoration led by architect Gerhard Fischer in 1939–1964 partly reversed those changes. The latest major restoration of the cathedral was conducted in 1999. Scottish craftsman Andrew Lawrenceson Smith (ca. 1620-1694) is well-known for his works in Stavanger Cathedral.

At the entrance to the sacristy there are sculptures of King Magnus VI, King Eric II and King Haakon V. The baptismal font is estimated to be from around the year 1300. The Bishop&#x27;s chair is from 1925.

===Election church===
In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway&#x27;s first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called &quot;electors&quot; who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.

== Architecture ==
The Stavanger Cathedral basilica has three aisles with diaphragm arches and an elevated central nave of Romanesque design. At one end of the nave is a square chancel surrounding the altar. The central nave is an arcade with round pillars along its length. The capitals on the pillars contains many figures depicting scenes of Ragnarok (). Further masonry decorations include palmettes and arcatures on cornices.

The east exterior of the building has two towers that contain lancet windows. There are a variety of sculptures between the towers and central building.

Around the year 1660, the parapet of the gallery was decorated with motifs copied from the &quot;Cor Iesu Amanti Sacrum&quot; series, otherwise known as Emblems from the Heart. Of the original six motifs, three are on display in Stavanger Museum.

<text>Mickleover is a village in the unitary authority of Derby, in Derbyshire, England. It is west of Derby, northeast of Burton upon Trent, southeast of Ashbourne and northeast of Uttoxeter.

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of Mickleover (and its close neighbour, Littleover) comes in 1011, when an early charter has King Aethelred granting Morcar, a high-ranking Mercian Thegn, land along the Trent and in Eastern Derbyshire, including land in the Mickleover and Littleover areas, consolidating estates he had inherited in North-East Derbyshire from his kinsman through marriage, Wulfric Spot, who founded Burton Abbey on the Staffs-Derbys border.

Mickleover appears in Domesday Book when it was still owned by the abbey. At the time of the Domesday Survey, 1086, Mickleover was known as Magna (the Old English version of this is Micel) Oufra. Magna, in early Latin means Great; oufra coming from Anglo Saxon ofer, flat-topped ridge. The oldest parts of the village now are located along Uttoxeter Road (B5020). In 1961 the civil parish had a population of 9709. On 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished and merged with Derby, Burnaston, Findern and Radbourne and was transferred to the County Borough of Derby from Repton Rural District. The resident population of Mickleover ward in 2003 was 13,528. The current population is estimated to be in excess of 18,000. Mickleover also has a mention in the earliest beginnings of the industrial revolution. The first industrial scale textile factory, a silk mill, was built in 1717 by John Lombe in Derby. Lombe had gained his experience processing silk in the smaller factory built and run by Thomas Cotchett of Mickleover. Cotchett&#x27;s factory was perhaps the first germ of industrial manufacture. Cotchett was born in Mickleover the son of Robert Cotchett, an officer in Cromwell&#x27;s army during the English civil war. Thomas Cotchett lived in Orchard Street in Mickleover in what is now known as &quot;The Old Hall&quot; which was built by Robert Cotchett between 1640 and 1650. The house represents a fine example of a timber-frame building and is one of a few still remaining in the area and is the oldest house in Mickleover.

==Geography==
Mickleover is directly south of the city of Derby and has seen multiple developments take place over the decades changing the town from a historic village to a suburb. Construction of the £5.2m Mickleover bypass (A516/A38) began in April 1972 and it was opened on 19 February 1975. Mickleover also benefits from its close connections to the cities of Derby, Nottingham, Lichfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Birmingham, Manchester and Sheffield among other towns and cities. Mickleover also sits directly close to the Staffordshire border near the town of Burton on Trent.
==Army Cadet Force==
Mickleover is home to the Mickleover Army Cadet Force Detachment.

== Railway history ==
The railway line which passed through Mickleover originally formed part of the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s Derbyshire Extension route from Grantham to Stafford and was opened in April 1878. It ran from Grantham on the East Coast Main Line via Nottingham Victoria, over Bennerley Viaduct (which still stands today) to Derby Friargate Station. This section of the Great Northern Railway, also known as the Friargate Line, (for further history about this now closed railway see GNR Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension), was built as a rival to the already established Midland Railway which at the time had a monopoly over Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding areas.

At Egginton Junction. it joined the Derby to Crewe line of the North Staffordshire Railway which it left at Bromshall Junction near Uttoxeter to journey on to Stafford. There was also a line from Egginton Junction via Dove Junction to Burton-on-Trent. Mickleover station (also called Mickleover for Radbourne) lay on the Derby – Egginton section, and was located about from the centre of the town.

Although most of the line was closed to passenger traffic in December 1939, Mickleover station remained open until 3 February 1964. The final passenger train left Friargate on 5 September 1964 and the line then closed throughout to passenger traffic on 7 September 1964. The section between Egginton Jcn. and Friargate was acquired by the Train Control Group of the BR Research Division, as a test track. It was singled between Friargate and Mickleover, but in 1973 the line was cut back to Mickleover since the eastern end of the track bed had been earmarked for the new A38 trunk road. Thereafter the line was used as a test track until 1990 when the A516 feeder road to the A50 by-pass was built over the trackbed and the line was closed and lifted.

The station building at Mickleover survives as a private residence. The route of the line is now a cycle track to Egginton and nature path with little to indicate its former status.

==University campus==
Mickleover from May 1964 until June 2007, housed a small campus of the University of Derby which in 2007-8 made way for nearly 700 new homes. The campus was formerly the Bishop Lonsdale College of Education, run by the Church of England (Derby Diocese), and housed the Education and Health departments as well as some social science courses. In late 2007 a new scout hut for the 166th Mickleover Scouts was also built on the site of the University Campus (Derby Campus).

== Schools ==
Mickleover has a number of primary schools: Wren Park Primary, Mickleover Primary, Brookfield Primary, Silverhill Primary and Ravensdale Infants and Ravensdale Junior school. There is also a secondary school, Murray Park School, which also borders the edge of Mackworth. Many residents of Mickleover, however, attend John Port Spencer Academy, or Littleover Community School at both of which it can be difficult to obtain a place because of high demand.

The town has two C of E churches – the 1960s St John the Evangelist and the older All Saints. There is also a Methodist chapel and a Roman Catholic church on Uttoxeter Road called Our Lady of Lourdes. All Saints once contained an infant school, as did the Old Tea Rooms, now known as the Mickleover Community Centre.

==Sports==
Mickleover F.C. is a semi-professional football team. They are based at the Mickleover Sports Club on Station Road and are members of the . The suburb also had another non-league team, Mickleover Royal British Legion F.C. who last played in the Central Midlands Football League.

Along with the above-mentioned Mickleover football teams, the town is also home to many junior sports teams. A notable example being the Mickleover Lightning Sox football team who are listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; 2005 for being involved in the longest penalty shootout.

Mickleover Golf Club, founded in 1923, is located off Uttoxeter Road.

Mickleover Running Club is an England Athletics affiliated running club.

==Hospitals and health centres==
The former Derby County Mental Hospital, later known as Pastures Hospital, was opened in 1851 on Merlin Way, south west of the centre of Mickleover. The hospital closed in 1994 and was converted to housing, named Duesbury Court after the hospital&#x27;s architect, Henry Duesbury.

Mickleover Medical Centre is an NHS health centre located on Vicarage Road.

==Notable people==
*Ben Warren (1879–1917), England international and Derby County footballer, was inmate at the Pastures Hospital from 1912 to his death.
*David Hampshire (1917–1990), racing driver.
*Patrick Allitt (born 1956), historian and academic.

<text>No 1 Poultry is a building in the City of London, allocated to office and commercial use. It occupies the apex where the eastern ends of Poultry and Queen Victoria Street meet at Mansion House Street, the western approach to Bank junction.

The design, by James Stirling, was constructed after the architect&#x27;s death. It replaced the Mappin &amp; Webb building, a neogothic, conical-turreted, grade II listed retail building, owned by developer Rudolph Palumbo and subsequently by his son, developer Peter Palumbo. Another option was a modernist minor skyscraper designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the manner of the Seagram Building in New York City – but dropped having failed in an influential architectural and planning show-down in the 1970s. The tall but less towering design, in a postmodernist style with an outer shell of even bands of rose-pink and muted yellow stone, prevailed. The point of the apex, as before, has a clock face but higher, as above a large pointed apex set of 30 window panes.

In 2016, the landowner proposed exterior alteration. Building users, experts and neighbours persuaded the experts at the designated UK body to protect and recognise the building and did so in the notable grade II* listed building category, making it, within England, the youngest at the time.

==Overview==

The present building was completed in 1997, five years after architect Stirling&#x27;s death and three years after construction began. It is a postmodern structure, with use of bold, perhaps unsubtle, forms and colours in a compact assembly. It is clad in pink and yellow limestone in even stripes (and apex arch stones, that is voussoirs) whilst the courtyard, an atrium, displays some of Stirling&#x27;s characteristic acidulous colour play.

Like many notable postmodern buildings, the imagery is rich in references. For example, from the sharp apex of the site a keyhole-shaped opening leads to a little-seen Scala Regia with a ramped floor, gold-leafed terminus and ancient Egyptian aura takes visitors into the heart of the building. Intended as site owner Palumbo&#x27;s private entrance, this space is now little used: Palumbo sold the development before its completion. The turret above is sometimes likened to a submarine conning tower while the glazed thus two-sided clock is in concept and detail that of the Art Deco era Palazzo delle Poste, Naples.

Completed nearly two decades after the first designs were published, the building saw a range of muted and divided views from leading critics as the heyday of postmodernism was over. Amongst the readers of &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, it was voted fifth-worst in London.

Following application generally supported by neighbours, users and experts, the building was protected and recognised by law as Grade II*-listed on 29 November 2016. The chief proponent was the Twentieth Century Society to block a planned redesign of the structure; thus the main opponent was the landowner.

==Construction==
As to the apex facing Mansion House, a Conservation Area, to rebuild drew much opposition particularly as standing there, in repairable condition, was a 19th-century neo-Gothic listed building occupied by crown jewellers Mappin and Webb. It had been designed by John Belcher in 1870.

An office building and public plaza by Mies van der Rohe was pencilled for the site in 1969, to be &quot;Mansion House Square&quot;. The successful counter-argument was retold by Prince Charles in his 1984 &quot;carbuncle&quot; speech to RIBA, viewing such a plan as &quot;yet another giant glass stump, better suited to downtown Chicago than the City of London&quot; and the plans were eventually scrapped.

A major archaeological dig was undertaken by the Museum of London Archaeology Service, directed by Peter Rowsome. This excavation made significant discoveries, including a wooden drain along the main Roman road. Using dendrochronology, this was dated to 47 CE, proving Roman Londinium had developed in this part of the city by that date.

Construction was completed in 1997. The building took in other smaller buildings to the east.

==Use==
No 1 Poultry comprises a mixed space of retail and offices.

A restaurant occupies the rooftop, and has a terrace and formal garden with far-reaching City views for drinkers and diners. It featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in the segment &#x27;Happy and Glorious&#x27; which saw Daniel Craig (as James Bond) escort Queen Elizabeth II to the Olympic Stadium by helicopter.

The terrace, below which is a fall of around 80 feet, has drawn notoriety in the City for having seen six cases of suicide by jumping off it: in 2007, 2009, twice in 2012, in 2015, and in 2016.

==Owners==
For four years the building was owned by a Heinrich Feldman company – selling it to Perella Weinberg Partners for £110 million, a 4.8% gain, in 2014. It sold again in 2018 to Hana Alternative Asset Management for £185m.

<doc id="420387" wikidata="Q18173" url="?curid=420387" title="Japan Air Lines Flight 123">
<text>Japan Air Lines Flight 123 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Tokyo to Osaka, Japan. On August12, 1985, the Boeing 747 flying the route suffered a severe structural failure and decompression 12minutes into the flight. After flying under minimal control for a further 32minutes, it crashed in the area of Mount Takamagahara, 100kilometres () from Tokyo.

The aircraft, featuring a high-density seating configuration, was carrying 524people. The crash killed all 15crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers on board, leaving four survivors. An estimated 20 to 50 passengers survived the initial crash but died from their injuries while awaiting rescue. The crash is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history and remains the deadliest aviation incident in Japan.

Japan&#x27;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission (AAIC), assisted by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, concluded that the structural failure was caused by a faulty repair by Boeing technicians following a tailstrike seven years earlier. When the faulty repair eventually failed, it resulted in a rapid decompression that ripped off a large portion of the tail and caused the loss of all hydraulic systems and flight controls.

==Background==

===Aircraft===
The Boeing 747SR-46 with registration JA8119 was built and delivered to Japan Air Lines in 1974. It had accumulated slightly more than 25,000 flight hours and 18,800 cycles (one cycle consisting of takeoff, cabin pressurization, depressurization, and landing).

===1978 tailstrike incident===
On June 2, 1978, while operating Japan Air Lines Flight 115 along the same route, JA8119 bounced heavily on landing while carrying out an instrument approach to runway 32L at Itami Airport. The pilot then excessively flared the aircraft, causing a severe tail strike on the second touchdown. Of the 394 people on board, 25 sustained injuries, 23 minor and 2 serious. The tailstrike cracked open the aft pressure bulkhead. The damage was repaired by Boeing technicians, and the aircraft was returned to service. The aircraft had flown for 8,830 hours at the time.

==Crew==
At the time of the accident, the aircraft was on the fifth of its six planned flights of the day. The flight had 15 crew members, consisting of 3 cockpit crew and 12 cabin crew.

The cockpit crew consisted of:
* Captain , aged 49, served as a training instructor for First Officer Yutaka Sasaki on the flight, supervising him while handling the radio communications, and also acting as first officer. Takahama was a veteran pilot, having logged about 12,423 flight hours, including about 4,842 hours in 747s.
* First Officer , age 39, was undergoing training for promotion to captain, and flew Flight 123 as one of his final training/evaluation flights, acting as captain. He had logged about 3,963 flight hours, including about 2,665 hours in 747s.
* Flight Engineer , age 46, was a veteran flight engineer having logged about 9,831 flight hours, including about 3,846 hours in 747s.

==Passengers==
The flight was during the Obon holiday period when many Japanese people make trips to their hometowns or to resorts. Twenty-two non-Japanese were on board the flight, including four residents of Hong Kong, two from Italy and six from United States, and one each from West Germany and the United Kingdom. Some ostensible foreigners had dual nationality, and some of them were residents of Japan.

The four survivors, all female, were seated on the left side and toward the middle of seat rows 54–60, in the rear of the aircraft. They were Yumi Ochiai, an off-duty flight attendant; Hiroko and Mikiko Yoshizaki, a mother and her 8-year-old daughter; and Keiko Kawakami, a 12-year-old girl who lost her parents and sister in the crash. Among the victims were Japanese singer and actor Kyu Sakamoto, and banker Akihisa Yukawa, the father of violinist and composer Diana Yukawa.

The flight connected two of the largest cities of Japan, and a number of other celebrities initially booked the flight but ultimately had either switched to another flight or used the Tokaido Shinkansen instead. These include Sanma Akashiya, Masataka Itsumi and his family, Johnny Kitagawa, and the then cast of &quot;Shōten&quot;. Some members of the Shonentai were also scheduled to travel with Kitagawa but had stayed in Tokyo.

The aircraft landed as JL366 at Haneda Airport in Ōta, Tokyo, Japan, from Fukuoka Airport at 5:12p.m. After almost an hour on the ground, Flight 123 pushed back from gate 18 at 6:04p.m. and took off from Runway 15L at 6:12p.m., 12 minutes behind schedule. Twelve minutes after takeoff, at 6:24p.m., at near cruising altitude over Sagami Bay east of Higashiizu, Shizuoka, the aircraft underwent rapid decompression,  bringing down the ceiling around the rear lavatories, damaging the unpressurised fuselage aft of the plane, unseating the vertical stabilizer, and severing all four hydraulic lines. A photograph taken from the ground shows the vertical stabilizer missing.

The pilots set their transponder to broadcast a distress signal. Captain Takahama contacted Tokyo Area Control Center to declare an emergency, and request a return to Haneda Airport, descending and following emergency landing vectors to Oshima. Tokyo Control approved a right-hand turn to a heading of 090° east back toward Oshima, and the aircraft entered an initial right-hand bank of 40°, several degrees greater than observed previously. Captain Takahama ordered First Officer Sasaki to reduce the bank angle,  and expressed confusion when the aircraft did not respond to the control wheel being turned left. The flight engineer reported that hydraulic pressure was dropping. The captain repeated the order to reduce the bank angle, as the autopilot had disengaged. He ordered the first officer to bank it back, then ordered him to pull up. None of these attempted maneuvers produced a response. The pilots realised the aircraft had become virtually uncontrollable, and Captain Takahama ordered the copilot to descend.

===6:27–6:34 p.m.===
Heading over the Izu Peninsula at 6:26p.m., the aircraft turned away from the Pacific Ocean and back toward the shore,  but only turned right far enough to fly a north-westerly course. Seeing that the aircraft was still flying west away from Haneda, Tokyo Control contacted the aircraft again. After confirming that the pilots were declaring an emergency, the controller asked the nature of the emergency. At this point, hypoxia appeared to have begun setting in, as the pilots did not respond. Also, the captain and co-pilot asked the flight engineer repeatedly if hydraulic pressure had been lost, seemingly unable to comprehend it.  Tokyo Control contacted the aircraft again and repeated the direction to descend and turn to a 90° heading to Oshima. Only then did the captain report that the aircraft had become uncontrollable. (Tokyo: &quot;Japan Air 124 [sic] fly heading 090 radar vector to Oshima.&quot; JAL123: &quot;But now uncontrol.&quot; Tokyo: &quot;Uncontrol, roger understood.&quot;) 

The aircraft traversed Suruga Bay and passed over Yaizu, Shizuoka,  at 6:31:02p.m. Tokyo Control asked if they could descend, and Captain Takahama replied that they were now descending, stating that their altitude was . Captain Takahama declined Tokyo Control&#x27;s suggestion to divert to Nagoya Airport away, instead preferring to land at Haneda,  which had the facilities to handle the 747. The flight data recorder shows that the flight did not descend, but was rising and falling uncontrollably.  With the total loss of hydraulic control and non-functional control surfaces, the aircraft entered phugoid oscillations lasting about 90 seconds, in which airspeed decreased as it climbed and increased as it fell. The rise in airspeed increased the lift over the wings, resulting in the aircraft climbing and slowing down, then descending and gaining speed again. Almost immediately after the separation of the stabiliser and rudder removed the only means of damping yaw, the aircraft began to exhibit Dutch roll, simultaneously yawing right and banking left, before yawing back left and banking right. At some points the banking motion became very profound, with large arcs of around 50° in cycles of 12 seconds.

Despite the complete loss of control, the pilots continued to turn the control wheel, pull on the control column, and move the rudder pedals up until the moment of the crash. The pilots also began efforts to establish control using differential engine thrust, as the aircraft slowly wandered back toward Haneda. Their efforts had limited success. The unpressurised aircraft rose and fell in an altitude range of for 18 minutes, from the moment of decompression until around 6:40p.m., with the pilots seemingly unable to figure out how to descend without flight controls. This was possibly due to the effects of hypoxia at such altitudes, as the pilots seemed to have difficulty comprehending their situation as the aircraft pitched and rolled uncontrollably. The pilots possibly were focused, instead, on the cause of the explosion they had heard, and the subsequent difficulty in controlling the jet. The flight engineer did say they should put on their oxygen masks when word reached the cockpit that the rear-most passenger masks had stopped working. None of the pilots put on their oxygen masks, however, though the captain simply replied &quot;yes&quot; to both suggestions by the flight engineer to do so. The accident report indicates that the captain&#x27;s disregard of the suggestion is one of several features &quot;regarded as hypoxia-related in [the] CVR record[ing].&quot; Their voices can be heard relatively clearly on the cockpit area microphone for the entire duration, until the crash, indicating that they did not put on their oxygen masks at any point in the flight.

===6:34–6:48 p.m.: Limited control===
At 6:35p.m. the flight engineer responded to multiple (hitherto unanswered) calls from Japan Air Tokyo via the SELCAL (selective-calling) system. Having just been informed about the inoperative oxygen masks, the flight engineer voiced the (erroneous) assumption that the R-5 door was broken and informed the company that they were making an emergency descent. Japan Air Tokyo asked if they intended to return to Haneda, to which the flight engineer responded that they were making an emergency descent, and to continue to monitor them.

Eventually, the pilots regained limited control of the aircraft by adjusting engine thrust. In doing so, they dampened the phugoid cycle and somewhat stabilised their altitude. However, given jet engines&#x27; inertia and the resulting response time (to changes in throttle), of Dutch roll mode by use of the differential thrust between the right and left engines is estimated practically impossible for a pilot.&quot; Shortly after 6:40p.m., they lowered the landing gear using the emergency extension system in an attempt to dampen the phugoid cycles and Dutch rolls further. This was somewhat successful, as the phugoid cycles were dampened almost completely, and the Dutch roll was damped significantly, but lowering the gear also decreased the directional control the pilots were getting by applying power to one side of the aircraft, and the aircrew&#x27;s ability to control the aircraft deteriorated.

Shortly after lowering the gear, the flight engineer asked if the speed brakes should be used, but the pilots did not acknowledge the request. The aircraft then began a right-hand descending 420° turn from a heading of 040° at 6:40p.m. to a heading of 100° at 6:45p.m., flying in a loop over Otsuki, due to a thrust imbalance created from having the power setting on Engine 1 (the left-most engine) higher than the other three engines. The aircraft also began descending from to , as the pilots had reduced engine thrust to near idle from 6:43 to 6:48p.m. Upon descending to at 6:45:46p.m., the pilots again reported an uncontrollable aircraft. At this time, the aircraft began to turn slowly to the left, while continuing to descend. The thicker air allowed the pilots more oxygen, and their hypoxia appeared to have subsided somewhat, as they were communicating more frequently. The pilots also appeared to be understanding how grave their situation had become, with Captain Takahama exclaiming, &quot;This may be hopeless&quot; at 6:46:33p.m. At 6:47p.m., the pilots recognised that they were beginning to turn toward the mountains. Despite efforts by the crew to get the aircraft to continue to turn right, it instead turned left, flying directly toward the mountainous terrain on a westerly heading.

Around 6:50p.m., a photographer on the ground captured a photograph of the aircraft, which showed that the vertical stabiliser was missing.

===6:48–6:55 p.m.: Final loss of control===
As the aircraft continued west, it descended below and was getting dangerously close to the mountains. Because of the thicker air at lower altitude, the cabin altitude alert momentarily turned off at this time, before resuming for the rest of the flight. The captain briefly ordered maximum engine power to attempt to get the aircraft to climb to avoid the mountains, and engine power was added abruptly at 6:48p.m., before being reduced back to near idle; then at 6:49p.m., it was ordered raised again. This greatly excited the phugoid motion, and the aircraft pitched up, before pitching back down after power was reduced. When power was added again, the aircraft rapidly pitched up to 40°, and the airspeed dropped down to at 6:49:30p.m., briefly stalling at . The captain immediately ordered maximum power at 6:49:40p.m. as the stick shaker sounded. The aircraft&#x27;s airspeed increased as it was brought into an unsteady climb. Possibly in order to prevent another stall, at 6:51p.m., the captain lowered the flaps to 5 units—due to the lack of hydraulics, using an alternate electrical system—in an additional attempt to exert control over the stricken jet. It took 3 minutes and 10 seconds for the trailing edge flaps to reach 5 units. The leading edge flaps except for the left and right outer groups were also extended and the extension was completed at 6:52:39p.m. From 6:49:03 to 6:52:11p.m., Japan Air Tokyo attempted to call the aircraft again via the SELCAL radio system. During the entire period, the SELCAL alarm continued to ring, to which the pilots did not react.

The aircraft reached at 6:53p.m., when the captain reported an uncontrollable aircraft for the third time. Shortly afterward, the controller asked the crew to switch the radio frequency to 119.7 for Tokyo Approach. Although the pilots did not acknowledge the request over the radio, they switched frequencies as instructed. Tokyo Approach then contacted the flight via the SELCAL system, briefly activating the corresponding alarm again until the flight engineer responded. At this point, the flight crew requested to be given their position, which, at 6:54p.m., was reported to the flight as northwest of Haneda, and west of Kumagaya. At 6:55p.m., the captain requested flap extension, and the co-pilot called out a flap extension to 10 units, but the flaps had already extended past 5 units at 6:54:30p.m. and had reached 20 units 1 minute and 2 seconds later. Meanwhile, the aircraft had started banking abnormally toward the right; this might have been most likely due to an imbalance in the lift generated by the left and right flaps. Power was increased at the same time. While the flaps continued to extend, a differential thrust setting caused engine power on the left side to be slightly higher than on the right side, adding to the roll to the right.

One minute later, the flaps were extended to about 25 units, the bank angle exceeded 60°, and the nose began to drop. Captain Takahama immediately ordered the flaps to be retracted and power was added abruptly, but still with higher power settings on the left engines than on the right. The asymmetric thrust settings continued to increase as the bank angle continued and exceeded 80°. The captain was heard on the CVR desperately requesting for the flaps to be retracted and for more power to be applied in a last-ditch effort to raise the nose. The aircraft continued an unrecoverable right-hand descent toward the mountains as the bank angle recovered to about 70° and engines were pushed to full power, during which the ground proximity warning system sounded.

In the final moments, as the airspeed exceeded , the pitch attitude leveled out and the aircraft ceased descending, with the aircraft and passengers/crew being subjected to 3 g of upward vertical acceleration.

===6:56 p.m.: Impact===

The aircraft was still in a 40° right-hand bank when the right-most (#4) engine struck the trees on top of a ridge located north-northwest of Mount Mikuni at an elevation of , which can be heard on the CVR recording. The backward shock of the impact, measuring 0.14 g, in addition to causing the loss of the thrust of the 4th engine, caused the aircraft to roll sharply to the right and the nose to drop again. The aircraft continued on this trajectory for 3 seconds until the right wing clipped another ridge containing a &quot;U-shaped ditch&quot; west-northwest of the previous ridge at an elevation of . It is speculated that this impact separated the remainder of the weakened tail from the airframe, along with the outer third of the right wing, and the remaining three engines, which were &quot;dispersed ahead&quot;. After this impact, the aircraft flipped on its back, struck another ridge northwest from the second ridge, near Mount Takamagahara, and exploded.

The impact registered on a seismometer located in the Shin-Etsu Earthquake Observatory at Tokyo University from 6:56:27p.m. as a small shock, to 6:56:32p.m. as a larger shock, believed to have been caused by the final crash. The shockwaves took an estimated 2.0–2.3 seconds to reach the seismometer, making the estimated time of the final crash 6:56:30p.m. Thus, 32 minutes had elapsed from the bulkhead failure to the crash.

===Crash site===
The aircraft crashed at an elevation of in Sector 76, State Forest, 3577 Aza Hontani, Ouaza Narahara, Ueno Village, Tano District, Gunma Prefecture. The east-west ridge is about north-northwest of Mount Mikuni. Ed Magnuson of &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that the area where the aircraft crashed was referred to as the &quot;Tibet&quot; of Gunma Prefecture.

==Delayed rescue operation==
A United States Air Force navigator stationed at Yokota Air Base published an account in 1995, stating that the U.S. military had monitored the distress calls and prepared a search-and-rescue operation that was aborted at the call of Japanese authorities. A U.S. Air Force C-130 crew was the first to spot the crash site 20 minutes after impact, while it was still daylight, and radioed the location to the Japanese and Yokota Air Base, where an Iroquois helicopter was dispatched. An article in the &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot; from 1985 stated that personnel at Yokota were on standby to help with rescue operations, but were never called by the Japanese government.

A JSDF helicopter later spotted the wreck after nightfall. Poor visibility and the difficult mountainous terrain prevented it from landing at the site. The pilot reported from the air no signs of survivors. Based on this report, JSDF personnel on the ground did not set out to the site on the night of the crash. Instead, they were dispatched to spend the night at a makeshift village erecting tents, constructing helicopter landing ramps, and engaging in other preparations, from the crash site. Rescue teams set out for the site the following morning. Medical staff later found bodies with injuries suggesting that people had survived the crash only to die from shock, exposure to low temperatures overnight in the mountains, or injuries that, if tended to earlier, would not have been fatal. One doctor said, &quot;If the discovery had come 10 hours earlier, we could have found more survivors.&quot;

One of the four survivors, off-duty Japan Air Lines flight purser recounted from her hospital bed that she recalled bright lights and the sound of helicopter rotors shortly after she awoke amid the wreckage, and while she could hear screaming and moaning from other survivors, these sounds gradually died away during the night.

==Investigation==
The official cause of the crash according to the report published by Japan&#x27;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission is:

# The aircraft was involved in a tailstrike incident at Osaka International Airport seven years earlier as JAL Flight 115, which damaged the aircraft&#x27;s aft pressure bulkhead.
# The subsequent repair of the bulkhead did not conform to Boeing&#x27;s approved repair methods. For reinforcing a damaged bulkhead, Boeing&#x27;s repair procedure calls for one continuous splice plate with three rows of rivets. The Boeing repair technicians, however, had used two splice plates parallel to the stress crack. Cutting the plate in this manner negated the effectiveness of the row of rivets, reducing the part&#x27;s resistance to fatigue cracking to about 70% of that for a correct repair. The post-repair inspection by JAL did not discover the defect, as it was covered by overlapping plates. During the investigation, the Accident Investigation Commission calculated that this incorrect installation would fail after about 11,000 pressurization cycles; the aircraft accomplished 12,318 successful flights from the time that the faulty repair was made to when the crash happened.
# Consequently, after repeated pressurization cycles during normal flight, the bulkhead gradually started to crack near the row of rivets holding it together. When it finally failed, the resulting rapid decompression ruptured the lines of all four hydraulic systems and ejected the vertical stabiliser. With many of the aircraft&#x27;s flight controls disabled, the aircraft became uncontrollable.

In an unrelated incident on 19 August 1982, while under the control of the first officer, JA8119 suffered a runway strike of the No. 4 engine on landing at Chitose Air Base in poor visibility. This was repaired successfully and the aircraft again returned to service. This incident did not contribute to the Flight 123 accident.

==Aftermath and legacy==

The Japanese public&#x27;s confidence in Japan Air Lines took a dramatic downturn in the wake of the disaster, with passenger numbers on domestic routes dropping by one-third. Rumors persisted that Boeing had admitted fault to cover up shortcomings in the airline&#x27;s inspection procedures, thereby protecting the reputation of a major customer. In the months after the crash, domestic air traffic decreased by as much as 25%. In 1986, for the first time in a decade, fewer passengers boarded JAL&#x27;s overseas flights during the New Year period than the previous year. Some of them considered switching to All Nippon Airways, JAL&#x27;s main competitor, as a safer alternative.

JAL paid ¥780 million (US$7.6 million) to the victims&#x27; relatives in the form of &quot;condolence money&quot; without admitting liability. JAL president Yasumoto Takagi resigned. In the aftermath of the incident, Hiroo Tominaga, a JAL maintenance manager, died from suicide intended to atone for the incident, as did Susumu Tajima, an engineer who had inspected and cleared the aircraft as flightworthy, whose suicide note cited &quot;work problems&quot;. In the end, JAL, Boeing, and the Japanese government paid substantial compensation to the victims&#x27; families.

In compliance with standard procedures, JAL retired flight number 123 for their Haneda-Itami routes, changing it to Flight 121 and Flight 127 on September 1, 1985. While Boeing 747s were still used on the same route operating with the new flight numbers in the years following the crash, they were replaced by the Boeing 767 or Boeing 777 in the mid-1990s. Boeing 747-100SRs continued to serve JAL on domestic routes until their retirement in 2006, having been replaced by newer widebody aircraft, such as the Boeing 747-400D and Boeing 777, introduced during the 1990s and early 2000s. Boeing 747 operations at JAL ended in 2011 when the last 747-400 was returned to the lessor as part of the airline&#x27;s efforts to cut costs, with twin-engined widebodies such as the Boeing 767, Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and Airbus A350 operating these routes today.

This would not be the only time that a 747 crashed due to faulty repair work following a tailstrike. In May 2002, 17 years after Flight 123&#x27;s crash and 22 years after the accident aircraft&#x27;s repair, China Airlines Flight 611 from Taipei to Hong Kong with 225 people on board crashed with no survivors when it broke up while cruising at around 35,000 feet. Like Flight 123, a doubler plate was not installed based upon Boeing standards.

In 2009, stairs with a handrail were installed to facilitate visitors&#x27; access to the crash site. On August 12, 2010, for the 25th anniversary of the accident, Japan Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism Minister Seiji Maehara visited the site to remember the victims. Families of the victims, together with local volunteer groups, hold an annual memorial gathering every August 12 near the crash site in Gunma Prefecture.
The crash led to the 2006 opening of the Safety Promotion Center, which is located on the grounds of Haneda Airport. This center was created for training purposes to alert employees to the importance of airline safety and their responsibility to ensure safety. The center has displays regarding aviation safety, the history of the crash, and selected pieces of the aircraft and passenger effects (including handwritten farewell notes). It is open to the public by appointment made between one day and two months before the visit.

The captain&#x27;s daughter, Yoko Takahama, who was a high-school student at the time of the crash, went on to become a JAL flight attendant.

On June 24, 2022, an oxygen mask belonging to Flight 123 was found near the crash site during road repair work. The discovery came nearly a year after engine parts were also found in the same area.

In 2024, the 39th anniversary day climb was joined by JALs President and CEO Mitsuko Tottori, who began her career with the airline as a flight attendant in 1985, the year of the Flight 123 accident. Speaking with reporters at the event, Tottori said, &quot;I renewed my awareness that there should be no compromise in safety.&quot;
==In popular culture==
* The events of Flight 123 were featured in &quot;Out of Control&quot;, a season-three (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday,&quot; which is entitled &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the U.S., and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere around the world. The dramatization was broadcast with the title &quot;&quot;(translation: Osutaka Ridge) in Japan. The flight was also included in a &quot;Mayday&quot; season-six (2007) &quot;Science of Disaster&quot; special, entitled &quot;Fatal Flaw&quot;, which was broadcast with the title &quot;Fatal Fix&quot; in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia. The crash was covered again in season 23 of &quot;Mayday&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;Pressure Point&quot;&quot;.&quot;
* It is featured in season 1, episode 2, of the TV show &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Breaking Point&quot;.
* The documentary series &quot;Aircrash Confidential&quot; featured the crash in a second-season episode titled &quot;Poor Maintenance&quot;, which first aired on March 15, 2012, on the Discovery Channel in the United Kingdom.
* The National Geographic Channel&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; featured the accident in season six, episode six, titled &quot;Terrified over Tokyo&quot;, released December 3, 2012.
* &quot;Seventeen&quot; (titled in Japanese as &quot;Climber&#x27;s High&quot;) the best-selling novel by Hideo Yokoyama, revolves around the reporting of the crash at the fictional newspaper &quot;Kita-Kanto Shimbun.&quot; Yokoyama was a journalist at the &quot;Jōmō Shimbun&quot; at the time of the crash. A film released in 2008, and also titled &quot;Climber&#x27;s High&quot;, is based on the novel.
* In 2009, the film &quot;Shizumanu Taiyō,&quot; starring Ken Watanabe, was released for national distribution in Japan. The film gives a semifictional account of the internal airline corporate disputes and politics surrounding the crash. The film does not mention Japanese Air Lines by name, using the name &quot;National Airlines&quot;, instead. JAL not only refused to co-operate with the making of the film, but also bitterly criticised the film, saying that it &quot;not only damages public trust in the company but [also] could lead to a loss of customers.&quot; The movie features music by Diana Yukawa, whose father was one of the victims of this disaster.
* The cockpit voice recording of the incident was incorporated into the script of a 1999 play called &quot;Charlie Victor Romeo&quot;.
* The 2004 album &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; by German band Rammstein is loosely inspired by the crash. The final moments of the cockpit voice recording are hidden in the pregap of the first track on some CD pressings of the album.

<doc id="420388" wikidata="Q126925" url="?curid=420388" title="Tennessee warbler">
<text>The Tennessee warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina) is a New World warbler that breeds in eastern North America and winters in southern Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. The specific name &quot;peregrina&quot; is from Latin &quot; peregrinus&quot; &quot;wanderer&quot;.

== Description ==

The Tennessee warbler is long, has a wingspan, and weighs roughly . The breeding male has olive back, shoulders, rump and vent. The flight feathers are brownish-black. It has a slate gray neck, crown and eyeline. The underside is a gray-white. The female is similar to the male, but is much duller and is tinged with yellow and olive overall, especially on the underside. The Tennessee warbler has long wings, short tail and a thin, pointy bill. Juveniles and first-year birds are quite similar to the female. In winter and fall, adult male resembles juvenile and spring adult female but shows more yellow below: the grey neck and crown turn into an olive green while the underside takes a yellow hue. On the face the yellow supraocular line stands out. Both sexes have white undertail coverts all year long. 

Tennessee warblers resemble female black-throated blue warblers. The only difference is that the black-throated blue has a darker cheek and two white wing spots.

This bird can be confused with the red-eyed vireo, which is larger, moves more deliberately and sings almost constantly. The orange-crowned warbler can also look similar, but lacks the white eyebrow, is greyer-brown above and has yellow undertail coverts.

== Distribution ==
The Tennessee warbler breeds from the Adirondack Mountains in New York through northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine north and west throughout much of Canada. It is also found breeding in northeast Minnesota and northern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is migratory, wintering in southern Central America, the Caribbean, and northern Colombia and Venezuela, with a few stragglers going as far south as Ecuador. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. This bird was named from a specimen collected in Tennessee, where it may appear during migration.

== Ecology and behavior ==
The Tennessee warbler feeds mainly on insects and prefers the spruce budworm. This species fluctuates in population with the quantity of the budworm. It also likes flower nectar, fruit and some seeds.

This warbler, like most others, is nervous and quick while foraging. It creeps along branches and is found at all levels. It is solitary while nesting, but forms mixed flocks after breeding.

The Tennessee warbler prefers coniferous forests, mixed conifer-deciduous forests, early successional woodlands and boreal bogs. It makes a cup-shaped nest of dried grasses and moss lined with finer grasses, stems and hair. The nest can be placed on the ground or above a bog in moss or in the base of a shrub. The nest is built by the female, and she lays 4–7 white eggs with brown splotches on them.

==Migration==
In the eastern United States, Tennessee warblers can be very common during migration. They are vagrants to the western United States, especially the Pacific coast.

<text>:&quot;See Kogaionon ungureanui for the mammal from the Upper Cretaceous.&quot;

Kogaionon was the holy mountain of the Geto-Dacians, the place where Zalmoxis stayed in a cave for three years. After his disappearance into Kogaionon, he was considered dead by the Getae but after three years he resurrected and showed himself to the people, who became convinced by his holy preaching when he emerged from Kogaionon.

Strabo claims that a river with the same name flowed in the vicinity.

One modern translation of Kogaionon is &quot;sacred mountain&quot;, which would be connected to a probable Dacian word &quot;kaga&quot; meaning &quot;sacred&quot;, attested in two early 2nd century inscriptions from Tomis.

Kogaionon&#x27;s location is still under debate, but it may be in the area around the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa Regia (there is a 2291m summit there called Gugu and there are speculations that it could be the holy mountain).

<text>Micropower radio is a subset of pirate radio concerned with low-power radio broadcasting, usually less than about 100 watts radiated power and sometimes less than 0.1 watt. Micropower radio transmits to a number of recipients (&quot;listeners&quot; or &quot;viewers&quot;) that belong to a small local group. Beginning in the early 1990s, there has been an increase in micropower radio because of the desire for such a service in local communities. Micropower radio gives an avenue for small groups and individuals to provide local neighborhood or community broadcasts of information, diverse programming, and entertainment. Micropower radio is &quot;usually&quot; a non-commercial service.

The Micro Radio Movement in the United States aims to change radio licensing laws. While never his intent to found a movement, Mbanna Kantako, founder of the Human Rights Radio Network, is often referred to as the founder or grandfather of the Micro Radio Movement.

In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires AM/FM radio and TV stations without a Low Power FM (LPFM) license to transmit with at least 6,000 watts of power. The FCC is not currently offering any LPFM licenses. This makes the cost of setting up a radio station prohibitive for individuals and small communities.

<doc id="420401" wikidata="Q1544627" url="?curid=420401" title="Strigoi">
<text>Strigoi in Romanian mythology are troubled spirits that are said to have risen from the grave. They are attributed with the abilities to transform into a beast, become invisible, and to gain vitality from the blood of their victims. Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; may be a modern interpretation of the Strigoi through their historic links with vampirism.

==Etymology==
Strigòi is a Romanian word that originated from a root related to the Latin terms &quot;strix&quot; or &quot;&quot; with the addition of the augmentative suffix (feminine &quot;-oaică&quot;). Otila Hedeşan notes that the same augmentative suffix appears in the related terms &quot;moroi&quot; and &quot;bosorcoi (&quot;borrowed from Hungarian &quot;boszorka&quot;) and considers this parallel derivation to indicate membership in the same &quot;mythological micro-system.&quot; The &quot;-oi&quot; suffix notably converts feminine terms to the masculine gender as well as often investing it with a complex mixture of augmentation and pejoration. The root has been related particularly to owls. Cognates are found throughout the Romance languages, such as the Italian words &quot;strega&quot; or the Venetian word &quot;strìga&quot; which mean &quot;witch&quot;. The Italian &quot;&quot; even has the parallel cognate augmentative suffix and means &quot;sorcerer.&quot; In French, &quot;stryge&quot; means a bird-woman who sucks the blood of children. Jules Verne used the term &quot;stryges&quot; in Chapter II of his novel &quot;The Carpathian Castle&quot;, published in 1892. The Greek word &quot;Strix&quot;, Polish &quot;strzyga&quot;, Hungarian &quot;sztriga&quot;, and the Albanian word &quot;shtriga&quot; are also cognate.

In the late Roman period the word became associated with witches or a type of ill-omened nocturnal flying creature. A &quot;strix&quot; (Late Latin &quot;striga&quot;, Greek στρίγξ), referred to night-time entities that craved human flesh and blood, particularly infants&#x27;.

It is related to the Romanian verb &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;to scream&quot;.

==Historiography==
=== Early reports===
One of the earliest mentions of a historical strigoi is the story of Jure Grando Alilović (1579–1656) from the region of Istria. The villager is believed to have been the first real person described as a vampire because he was referred to as a &quot;strigoi&quot;, &quot;štrigon&quot; or &quot;štrigun&quot; in contemporary local records. Grando is supposed to have terrorized his former village sixteen years after his death. Eventually he was decapitated by the local priest and villagers. The Carniolan scientist Johann Weikhard von Valvasor wrote about Jure Grando Alilović&#x27;s life and afterlife in his extensive work &quot;The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot; when he visited Kringa during his travels. This was the first written document on vampires. Grando was also mentioned in writings by Erasmus Francisci and Johann Joseph von Goerres (&quot;La mystique divine, naturelle, et diabolique&quot;, Paris 1855), whose story was much more elaborate, full of fantastic details to make the story more interesting and sensational. In modern times, the Croatian writer Boris Perić has researched the legend and written a book (&quot;The Vampire&quot;) on the story.

&quot;Striga&quot; are mentioned by the Moldavian statesman and soldier Dimitrie Cantemir in his work &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot; (1714–1716). He thought that the striga were mostly Moldavian and Transylvanian beliefs. However, he associated them with witches or warlocks rather than blood-drinking undead vampires. The book mentions dunking – a traditional test for witchcraft – as a method of identifying a striga.

===Modern writings===

An 1865 article on Transylvanian folklore by Wilhelm Schmidt describes the &quot;strigoi&quot; as nocturnal creatures that preyed on infants. He reports a tradition in which, upon the birth of a child, one tosses a stone behind oneself and exclaims &quot;This into the mouth of the &quot;strigoi&quot;!&quot;

In 1909, Franz Hartmann mentioned in his book &quot;An Authenticated Vampire Story&quot; that peasant children from a village in the Carpathian Mountains started to die mysteriously. The villagers began to suspect a recently deceased count was a vampire, dwelling in his old fortress. Frightened villagers burned the castle to stop the deaths.

===Communist era===
In his book &quot;In Search of Dracula, The History of Dracula and Vampires&quot;, Radu Florescu mentions an event in 1969 in the city of Căpățâneni, where after the death of an old man, several family members began to die in suspicious circumstances. Unearthed, the corpse did not show signs of decomposition, his eyes were wide open, and his face was red and twisted. The corpse was burned to save his soul.

During the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the corpse of Nicolae Ceaușescu did not receive a proper burial. This made the ghost of the former dictator a threat in the minds of superstitious Romanians. A revolutionary activist, Gelu Voican, carpeted the apartment of the Conducător with braids of garlic. This is a traditional remedy against the strigoi.

===Post-communist era===
In February 2004, a woman from the village of Marotinu de Sus in Dolj County, claimed that she had been visited by her late uncle, a 76-year-old Romanian man named Petre Toma who had died in December the previous year. Fearing the deceased might have become a &quot;strigoi&quot;, the woman&#x27;s brother-in-law, Gheorghe Marinescu, organized a vampire hunting group made up of several family members. After drinking some alcohol, they dug up the coffin of Petre Toma, made an incision in his chest, and tore the heart out. After removal of the heart, the body was burned and the ashes were mixed in water and drunk by Toma&#x27;s niece, believing that this would put an end to the haunting. Dolj County police later arrested six of the family members who participated in the ritual, charging them with &quot;disturbing the peace of the dead&quot;. They were sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment and ordered to pay damages to the family of the deceased. Since then, in the nearby village of Amărăştii de Sus, people drive a fire-hardened stake through the heart or belly of the dead as a &quot;preventive measure&quot;.

== Mythology ==
===Creation===
The encyclopedist Dimitrie Cantemir and the folklorist Teodor Burada in his book &quot;Datinile Poporului român la înmormântări&quot; published in 1882 refer to cases of strigoism. The strigoi can be a living man, born under certain conditions:

* Be the seventh child of the same sex in a family
* Lead a life of sin
* Die without being married
* Die by execution for perjury
* Die by suicide
* Die from a witch&#x27;s curse

The strigoi are said to be bald on top of the head, do not eat garlic and onions, avoid incense, and towards the feast of Saint Andrew they sleep outdoors. Their spine is elongated in the shape of a tail, covered with hair.

If there is a drought in a village, it means that there is a strigoi that prevents the rains. If it rains with stones (hail), God punishes the strigoi who does not let &quot;clean rain fall&quot;, and if it rains with sun, it is believed that one of the strigoi has been killed.

The strigoi take the milk from the cows, take the manna of the wheat, the strength of the people, stop the rains, bring hail and bring death among men and cattle. On Saint George&#x27;s day (April 23), the boys water the girls so that they don&#x27;t suffer from strigoi, but also so that they don&#x27;t turn into these creatures.

To kill them, the grave of the supposed strigoi is searched and the order is read to him by the priests and an oak, yew or ash branch is struck in his heart, it is pierced with a nail or a knife, to remain bound of the coffin and not being able to go out to do mischief.

===Types===
Tudor Pamfile in his book &quot;Mitologie românească&quot; compiles all appellations of strigoi in Romania &quot;strâgoi&quot;, &quot;Moroi&quot; in western Transylvania, Wallachia and Oltenia, &quot;vidmă&quot; in Bucovina, &quot;vârcolacul&quot;, &quot;Cel-rau&quot;, or vampire. The types described are: 
* Strigoaică: a witch.
* Strigoi viu: a living strigoi or sorcerer. 
* Strigoi mort: a dead strigoi, the most dangerous. They emerge from their graves in order to torment their families until their relatives die.

=== Prevention and protection ===

A common way used to identify a vampire was to place a 7-year-old boy of &#x27;purity&#x27; dressed in white on a white horse near the graveyard at midday. It was believed that the horse would stop at the grave of the suspected vampire.

In 1887, French geographer Élisée Reclus details burials in Romania: &quot;If the deceased has red hair, he is very concerned that he was back in the form of dog, frog, flea or bedbug, and that it enters into houses at night to suck the blood of beautiful young girls. So it is prudent to nail the coffin heavily, or, better yet, a stake through the chest of the corpse.&quot;

Simeon Florea Marian in &quot;Înmormântarea la români&quot; (1892) describes another preventive method, unearthing and beheading, then re-interring the corpse and head face-down.

&quot;The Dracula Scrapbook&quot; by Peter Haining, published by New English Library editions in 1976, reported that the meat of a pig killed on the 17 October, the feast day of Saint Ignatius, was a good way to guard against vampires, according to Romanian legend.

==Other uses==
&quot;Strigoiulu&quot; (the Strigoi) was the name of a Romanian-language satirical magazine published briefly in 1862 in Pest.

<doc id="420402" wikidata="Q1819273" url="?curid=420402" title="Ben Klassen">
<text>Bernhardt &quot;Ben&quot; Klassen ( () – ) was an American white supremacist politician and religious leader. He founded the Church of the Creator with the publication of his book &quot;Nature&#x27;s Eternal Religion&quot; in 1973. Klassen was openly racist, antisemitic and anti-Christian and first popularized the term &quot;Racial Holy War&quot; within the White Power movement.

Klassen was a Republican Florida state legislator for several months, as well as a supporter of George Wallace&#x27;s presidential campaign. In addition to his religious and political work, Klassen was an electrical engineer and he was also the inventor of a wall-mounted electric can-opener. Klassen held unorthodox views about dieting and health. He was a natural hygienist who opposed the germ theory of disease as well as conventional medicine and promoted a fruitarian, raw food diet.

== Early life ==

Klassen was born on February 20, 1918, in Rudnerweide (now &quot;Rozivka&quot; in Chernihivka Raion in Zaporizhzhia Oblast), Ukraine, to Bernhard and Susanna Klassen (née Friesen) a Russian Mennonite Christian couple. He had two sisters and two brothers. When Klassen was nine months old, he caught typhoid fever and nearly died. Due to the Russian Civil War, circumstances during his early childhood were quite difficult. When he was five, the family moved to Mexico, where they lived for one year. In 1925, at age six, he moved with his family to Herschel, Saskatchewan, Canada. He attended the German-English Academy (now Rosthern Junior College).

==Entrepreneurship==
Klassen established a real estate firm in Los Angeles in partnership with Ben Burke. Believing that his partner was prone to drinking and gambling, Klassen eventually bought him out and became sole proprietor. He hired several salesmen, including Merle Peek, who convinced him to buy large land development projects in Nevada. Klassen and Peek started a partnership called the Silver Springs Land Company, through which they founded the town of Silver Springs, Nevada. In 1952, Klassen sold his share of the company to Phillip Hess for $150,000 and retired.

On March 26, 1956, Klassen filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office to patent a wall-mounted, electric can opener which he marketed as Canolectric. In partnership with the marketing firm Robbins &amp; Myers, Klassen created Klassen Enterprises, Inc. In the face of competition from larger manufacturers that could provide similar products more cheaply, Klassen and his partners dissolved the company in 1962.

==Political career==
Klassen served Broward County in the Florida House of Representatives from November 1966 – March 1967, running on an anti-busing, anti-government platform. He campaigned for election to the Florida Senate in 1967, but was defeated. That same year, he was vice chairman of an organization in Florida which supported George Wallace&#x27;s presidential bid.

Klassen was a member of the John Birch Society, at one point operating an American Opinion bookstore, but became disillusioned with the Society because of what he viewed as its tolerant position towards Jews. In November 1970, Klassen, along with Austin Davis, created the Nationalist White Party. The party&#x27;s platform was directed at White Christians and it was explicitly religious and racial in nature; the first sentence of the party&#x27;s fourteen-point program is &quot;We believe that the White Race was created in the Image of the Lord.&quot; The logo of the Nationalist White Party was a &quot;W&quot; with a crown and a halo over it, and it would be used three years later as the logo of the Church of the Creator.

Less than a year after he created the Nationalist White Party, Klassen began expressing apprehension about Christianity to his connections through letters. These letters were not well received, and they effectively ended the influence of the Nationalist White Party.

==Church of the Creator==

In 1973, Klassen founded the Church of the Creator (COTC) with the publication of &quot;Nature&#x27;s Eternal Religion&quot;. Individual church members are called Creators, and the religion they practice is called Creativity.

In 1982, Klassen established the headquarters of his church in Otto, North Carolina. Klassen wrote that he established a school for boys. The original curriculum was a two-week summer program that included activities such as &quot;hiking, camping, training in handling of firearms, archery, tennis, white water rafting and other healthy outdoor activities&quot;, as well as instruction on &quot;the goals and doctrines of Creativity and how they could best serve their own race in various capacities of leadership.&quot;

In July 1992, George Loeb, a minister in the church, was convicted of murdering a black sailor in Jacksonville, Florida. Fearing that a conviction might mean the loss of 20 acres of land worth about $400,000 in Otto, North Carolina, belonging to the church, Klassen sold it to another white supremacist, William Luther Pierce, author of the &quot;Turner Diaries&quot;, for $100,000.

Klassen appointed himself Pontifex Maximus of the church until January 25, 1993, when he transferred the title to Dr. Rick McCarty.

===Racial holy war===
Ben Klassen first popularized the term &quot;Racial Holy War&quot; (RaHoWa) within the white nationalist movement. He also consistently called black people &quot;niggers&quot; in public discourse as well as in the literature of the COTC, as opposed to many white nationalist leaders who use relatively more polite terms in public. Klassen wrote, &quot;Furthermore, in looking up the word in Webster&#x27;s dictionary I found the term &#x27;nigger&#x27; very descriptive: &#x27;a vulgar, offensive term of hostility and contempt for the black man&#x27;. I can&#x27;t think of anything that defines better and more accurately what our position... should be... If we are going to be for racial integrity and racial purity... we must take a hostile position toward the nigger. We must give him nothing but contempt.&quot;

In his 1987 book &quot;Rahowa – This Planet Is All Ours&quot; he claims that Jews created Christianity in order to make white people weaker, and he said that the first priority should be to &quot;smash the Jewish Behemoth&quot;.

==Personal beliefs==

Klassen was a natural hygienist who promoted a back to nature philosophy that espoused fresh air, clean water, sunshine and outdoor exercise. He recommended a raw food diet which consisted of fruits and vegetables and believed that medicine and processed foods create cancer inside the body. Klassen wrote that food must be &quot;uncooked, unprocessed, unpreserved and not tampered with in any other way. This further means it must be organically grown without the use of chemicals.&quot;

Klassen promoted &quot;racial health&quot; and natural hygiene principles, and he was influenced by the works of Herbert M. Shelton. Klassen believed that fasting would cleanse the body of toxins, and he also believed that a fruitarian raw food diet would cure disease. Klassen rejected the germ theory of disease and believed that modern medicine was a Jewish multi-billion-dollar fraud. Klassen contributed an introduction and a chapter on eugenics to Arnold DeVries&#x27; book &quot;Salubrious Living&quot; (1982). The book endorsed fasting, sunbathing, fruitarian and raw food dieting. Historian George Michael has written that &quot;despite his advocacy of healthy nutrition, some of his associates claimed that in practice Klassen did not actually follow the &quot;salubrious living&quot; regimen, because he often ate red meat and ice cream.&quot;

Klassen firmly opposed religion because he believed it was superstitious, and he described Christianity as a &quot;Jewish creation&quot; which was designed to unhinge white people by promoting a &quot;completely perverted attitude&quot; about life and nature. He rejected the afterlife as &quot;nonsense&quot;. He argued that man&#x27;s morality and sense of purpose is based on the laws of nature and racial loyalty. Klassen believed that the white race was the sole builder of civilization and all of the advanced civilizations which existed in antiquity were created by white people but they were destroyed because they practiced miscegenation.

== Death ==
Possibly depressed after the death of his wife, the failure of his church and a diagnosis of cancer and considering suicide a suitable way to end his life, Klassen took an overdose of sleeping pills either late on August 6 or early on August 7, 1993. Klassen was buried on his North Carolina property in an area which he had previously designated &quot;Ben Klassen Memorial Park&quot;.

<text>Princes Street () is one of the major thoroughfares in central Edinburgh, Scotland and the main shopping street in the capital. It is the southernmost street of Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, stretching around 1.2 km (three quarters of a mile) from Lothian Road in the west, to Leith Street in the east. The street has few buildings on the south side and looks over Princes Street Gardens allowing panoramic views of the Old Town, Edinburgh Castle, as well as the valley between. Most of the street is limited to trams, buses and taxis with only the east end open to all traffic.
==History==
===18th century===


The street lies on the line of a medieval country lane known as the Lang Dykes and under the first plan for the New Town was to have been called St Giles Street after the patron saint of Edinburgh. However, when King George III was shown a print or drawing of the proposed New Town by Sir John Pringle, he objected to the name as he associated it with the notorious slum area of St Giles, London. At Pringle&#x27;s suggestion, the street was instead named Prince&#x27;s Street after King George&#x27;s eldest son, Prince George, Duke of Rothesay (later King George IV) as recounted in his 1767 letter to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh. By the late 1830s the apostrophe in the name (which had also sometimes been written as Princes&#x27; Street) had largely fallen out of use, giving the street its present day name of Princes Street. The apparent plurality in the name has given rise to various erroneous explanations of the name.

It was laid out according to formal plans for Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, now known as the First New Town. These were devised by the architect James Craig and building began around 1770. Princes Street represented a critical part of the plan, being the outer edge, facing Edinburgh Castle and the original city, Edinburgh Old Town. Originally all buildings had the same format: set back from the street with stairs down to a basement and stairs up to the ground floor with two storeys and an attic above. Of this original format only one such property, no.95, remains in its original form.

===19th century===
Through the 19th century most buildings were redeveloped at a larger scale and the street evolved from residential to mainly retail uses.

From the 1880s the street, with its commanding views in combination with great ease of access, became a popular street upon which to locate hotels. The railway companies created huge anchor hotels at either end: the Caledonian Hotel to the west, and North British Hotel to the east. In between were the Royal British Hotel, Old Waverley Hotel, and Mount Royal Hotel, all of which survive. Princes Street was also home to two leading department stores, Jenners founded in 1838 and rebuilt in 1893–1895, and Forsyth&#x27;s built in 1906–1907, both technically advanced and architecturally ornate buildings for their time.

===20th century===
By the 1930s the architecture of Princes Street had a very mixed character. The Abercrombie Plan of 1949 proposed tighter control of design to create a more coherent appearance. This theme was taken up by the Princes Street Panel, whose 1967 report proposed comprehensive redevelopment with Modernist buildings to incorporate a first-floor level walkway, theoretically doubling the shopping frontage. The plan was partially put into operation, resulting in the demolition of seven old buildings, and the erection of seven new, before the approach was dropped in the 1970s. Two of the new buildings, British Home Stores at number 64, and the New Club at numbers 84–87, are now listed buildings.

There has been controversy over buildings from the latter half of the 20th century on Princes Street. This has prompted plans to demolish the BHS and the Marks &amp; Spencer buildings, in an effort to improve the status of the street. Another problem has been that upper floors are often used for storage, rather than as office, retail or living space. At an early stage in post-World War II designs for the street, a &quot;high level walkway&quot; was planned, as a further shopping frontage for the first floor level, in lieu of the other side of the street. However the walkway as built was never more than a number of isolated balconies and in practice the Royal Bank of Scotland was the only business to maintain a frontage at this level for any length of time; that branch of the bank closed early in the 21st century, leaving the upper walkway largely forgotten.

Princes Street was the scene of rioting in 2005 related to the 31st G8 summit referred to in the press as &quot;The Battle of Princes Street&quot;.

===21st century===
Several UK well-known high street brands such as Boots, H&amp;M, and Marks &amp; Spencer, are located on Princes Street. A couple of new hotels are destined to open on Princes Street in 2022, including the Red Carnation Hotel at 100 Princes Street.

On 25 January 2021, it was announced that Jenners department store, which has been located on Princes Street since Victorian times, was to close on May 3, 2021, in preparation for a three-year-long redevelopment. Also on 25 January, it was announced that Debenhams&#x27;s department store on Princes Street would also close in May 2021. It was also announced on 25 January, that the administrator for troubled Arcadia group that own Topman and Topshop (also located on Princes Street) were in talks with online shopping brand ASOS with a view to selling the brands online, leaving the historic Edinburgh street losing recognisable brands, with many now migrating to the newly opened St James Quarter.

==Princes Street Gardens and south side==


During the construction of the New Town, the polluted waters of the Nor Loch were drained, and the area was converted into private gardens called Princes Street Gardens. This was taken over by the Edinburgh Council in the late-nineteenth century, by which time most of the street was commercial and there was no great need for private residential gardens. The width of Princes Street was greatly increased soon after, onto what was the northern edge of the gardens. Due to the much lower position of the gardens this led to the creation of the steep embankment on the north side, still visible today. The gardens are one of the many green spaces in the heart of Edinburgh.

The Gardens contain the Ross Bandstand (an open-air theatre), a war memorial to US soldiers of Scottish descent and a floral clock, together with other attractions. Two of the main Scottish art galleries, the Royal Scottish Academy and the National Gallery of Scotland, are located at the foot of The Mound and are served by Princes Street tram stop. Further along is the Scott Monument, a huge intricate Gothic monument dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, the author of the Waverley Novels, after which is named Waverley station, which lies at the east end of the Gardens, its westward lines dividing them. Next to the station on its north side is the former railway hotel, previously known as the &quot;North British Hotel&quot;, latterly renamed the Balmoral Hotel, and the North Bridge which sails at high level over the station. The hotel has a counterpart at the extreme west end of Princes Street. The Caledonian Hotel, now the Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian, sits at the north end of Lothian Road. This was built by the Caledonian Railway for their Princes Street Station which closed in the 1960s along with the lines it served.

At the west end of Princes Street, St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church at the corner of Lothian Road is built at street level above a basement crypt and a small churchyard. In addition, there are several fair trade outlets in this space as part of the church, whilst St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church stands just to the south of it, in a far larger and older churchyard, west of the gardens.
The floral clock dates from 1903 when it was first planted by the Park Superintendent, John McHattie. It displays a different theme every summer.

Princes Street remains popular, although it has now fallen from its status as the most expensive place to rent shop space in the UK outside of London. Princes Street may be one of the few streets in the UK to have an order of Parliament placed on it to prevent any further building on the south side, so as to preserve its open vista.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===

Only the eastern third of Princes Street is open to general traffic. The main length is restricted to trams, buses, taxis and cyclists only.

=== Rail ===

Edinburgh Waverley railway station lies at the eastern end of Princes Street.

=== Tram ===
The Princes Street tram stop is an in-road island, situated just west of the Royal Scottish Academy near the foot of the Mound.



=== Buses ===

Princes Street is the focus of the majority of bus routes served by Lothian Buses.

Edinburgh Bus Station is around north of the east end of Princes Street, in the north-east corner of St Andrew Square.

<text>Nūr ad-Dīn &#x27;Abd ar-Rahmān Jāmī (; 7 November 1414 – 9 November 1492), also known as Mawlanā Nūr al-Dīn &#x27;Abd al-Rahmān or Abd-Al-Rahmān Nur-Al-Din Muhammad Dashti, or simply as Jami or Djāmī and in Turkey as Molla Cami, was a Persian Sunni poet who is known for his achievements as a prolific scholar and writer of mystical Sufi literature. He was primarily a prominent poet-theologian of the school of Ibn Arabi and a Khwājagānī Sũfī, recognized for his eloquence and for his analysis of the metaphysics of mercy. His most famous poetic works are &quot;Haft Awrang&quot;, &quot;Tuhfat al-Ahrar&quot;, &quot;Layla wa Majnun&quot;, &quot;Fatihat al-Shabab&quot;, &quot;Lawa&#x27;ih&quot;, &quot;Al-Durrah al-Fakhirah&quot;. Jami belonged to the Naqshbandi Sufi order.

==Biography==
Jami was born in Kharjerd, in Khorasan to a Persian family. Previously his father Nizām al-Dīn Ahmad b. Shams al-Dīn Muhammad had come from Dasht, a small town in the district of Isfahan. A few years after his birth, his family migrated to Herat, where he was able to study Peripateticism, mathematics, Persian literature, natural sciences, Arabic language, logic, rhetoric, and Islamic philosophy at the Nizamiyyah University. His father, also a Sufi, became his first teacher and mentor. While in Herat, Jami held an important position at the Timurid court, involved in the era&#x27;s politics, economics, philosophy and religious life. Jami was a Sunni Muslim.

Because his father was from Dasht, Jami&#x27;s early pen name was &quot;Dashti,&quot; but later, he chose to use &quot;Jami&quot; because of two reasons he later mentioned in a poem:

Jami was a mentor and friend of the famous Turkic poet Alisher Navoi, as evidenced by his poems:
Afterward, he went to Samarkand, the most important center of scientific studies in the Muslim world and completed his studies there. He embarked on a pilgrimage that greatly enhanced his reputation and further solidified his importance through the Persian world. Jami had a brother called Molana Mohammad, who was, apparently a learned man and a master in music, and Jami has a poem lamenting his death. Jami fathered four sons, but three of them died before reaching their first year. The surviving son was called Zia-ol-din Yusef and Jami wrote his Baharestan for this son.
At the end of his life he was living in Herat. His epitaph reads &quot;When your face is hidden from me, like the moon hidden on a dark night, I shed stars of tears and yet my night remains dark in spite of all those shining stars.&quot; There is a variety of dates regarding his death, but consistently most state it was in November 1492. Although, the actual date of his death is somewhat unknown the year of his death marks an end of both his greater poetry and contribution, but also a pivotal year of political change where Spain was no longer inhabited by the Arabs after 781 years. His funeral was conducted by the prince of Herat and attended by great numbers of people demonstrating his profound impact.

==Teachings and Sufism==
In his role as Sufi shaykh, which began in 1453, Jami expounded a number of teachings regarding following the Sufi path. He created a distinction between two types of Sufi&#x27;s, now referred to as the &quot;prophetic&quot; and the &quot;mystic&quot; spirit. Jami is known for both his extreme piety and mysticism. He remained a staunch Sunni on his path toward Sufism and developed images of earthly love and its employment to depict the spiritual passion of the seeker of God. He began to take an interest in Sufism at an earlier age when he received a blessing by a principal associate Khwaja Mohammad Parsa who came through town. From there he sought guidance from Sa&#x27;d-alDin Kasgari based on a dream where he was told to take God and become his companion. Jami followed Kasagari and the two became tied together upon Jami&#x27;s marriage to Kasgari&#x27;s granddaughter. He was known for his commitment to God and his desire for separation from the world to become closer to God often causing him to forget social normalities.

After his re-emergence into the social world he became involved in a broad range of social, intellectual and political actives in the cultural center of Herat. He was engaged in the school of Ibn Arabi, greatly enriching, analyzing, and also changing the school or Ibn Arabi. Jami continued to grow in further understanding of God through miraculous visions and feats, hoping to achieve a great awareness of God in the company of one blessed by Him. He believed there were three goals to achieve &quot;permanent presence with God&quot; through ceaselessness and silence, being unaware of one&#x27;s earthly state, and a constant state of a spiritual guide. Jami wrote about his feeling that God was everywhere and inherently in everything. He also defined key terms related to Sufism including the meaning of sainthood, the saint, the difference between the Sufi and the one still striving on the path, the seekers of blame, various levels of tawhid, and the charismatic feats of the saints. Oftentimes Jami&#x27;s methodology did not follow the school of Ibn Arabi, like in the issue of mutual dependence between God and his creatures Jami stated &quot;We and Thou are not separate from each other, but we need Thee, whereas Thou dost not need us.&quot;

Jami created an all-embracing unity emphasized in a unity with the lover, beloved, and the love one, removing the belief that they are separated. Jami was in many ways influenced by various predecessors and current Sufi&#x27;s, incorporating their ideas into his own and developing them further, creating an entirely new concept. In his view, love for Muhammad was the fundamental stepping stone for starting on the spiritual journey. Jami served as a master to several followers and to one student who asked to be his pupil who claimed never to have loved anyone, he said, &quot;Go and love first, then come to me and I will show you the way.&quot; For several generations, Jami had a group of followers representing his knowledge and impact. Jami continues to be known for not only his poetry, but his learned and spiritual traditions of the Persian speaking world. In analyzing Jami&#x27;s work greatest contribution may have been his analysis and discussion of God&#x27;s mercy towards man, redefining the way previous texts were interpreted.

==Works==

Jami wrote approximately eighty-seven(87) books and letters, some of which have been translated into English. His works range from prose to poetry, and from the mundane to the religious. He has also written works of history and science. As well, he often comments on the work of previous and current theologians, philosophers and Sufi&#x27;s. 

In Herat, his manual of irrigation design included advanced drawings and calculations and is still a key reference for the irrigation department. His poetry has been inspired by the ghazals of Hafiz, and his famous divan &quot;Haft Awrang&quot; (Seven Thrones) is, by his own admission, influenced by the works of Nizami. The Haft Awrang also known as the long masnavis or mathnawis are a collection of seven poems. Each poem discusses a different story such as the Salaman va Absal that tells the story of a carnal attraction of a prince for his wet-nurse. Jami uses allegorical symbolism within the tale to depict the key stages of the Sufi path such as repentance and expose philosophical, religious, or ethical questions. Each of the allegorical symbols has a meaning highlighting knowledge and intellect, particularly of God. This story reflects Jamī&#x27;s idea of the Sufi-king as the ideal medieval Islamic ruler to repent and embark upon the Sufi path to realize his rank as God&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; vicegerent and become closer to God. 

Another composition of Jami is that of the &quot;Kherad-name&quot;, which he composed in the tradition of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, especially in that of the Persian version of Nizami Ganjavi&#x27;s &quot;Iskandarnameh&quot;. He completed this work perhaps around 1485, and in it he moves the emphasis from stories about Alexander&#x27;s journey and conquest to short anecdotes that display notions of wisdom and philosophy.

As well, Jami is known for his three collections of lyric poems that range from his youth towards the end of his life called the Fatihat al-shabab (The Beginning of Youth), Wasitat al-&#x27;ikd (The Central Pearl in the Necklace), and Khatimat al-hayat (The conclusion of Life). Throughout Jami&#x27;s work references to Sufism and the Sufi emerge as being key topics. One of his most profound ideas was the mystical and philosophical explanations of the nature of divine mercy, which was a result of his commentary on other works.

==Artwork==
Jami is also known for his poetry influencing and being included with Persian paintings that depict Persian history through manuscript paintings. Most of his own literature included illustrations that were not yet common for literature. The deep poetry Jami provides is usually accompanied with enriched paintings reflecting the complexity of Jami&#x27;s work and Persian culture.

==Impact of Jami&#x27;s works==
Jami worked within the Tīmūrid court of Herat helping to serve as an interpreter and communicator. His poetry reflected Persian culture and was popular through Islamic East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Jami&#x27;s poetry addressed popular ideas that led to Sufi&#x27;s and non-Sufi&#x27;s interest in his work. He was known not only for his poetry, but his theological works and commentary on culture. His work was used in several schools from Samarqand to Istanbul to Khayrābād in Persia as well as in the Mughal Empire. For centuries Jami was known for his poetry and profound knowledge. In the last half-century, Jami has begun to be neglected and his works forgotten, which reflects an overarching issue in the lack of research of Islamic and Persian studies. His poetry reached the Ottoman Empire, due to the poet Basiri emigrating to Istanbul.

==Divan of Jami==

* &quot;Baharestan (Abode of Spring)&quot; Modeled upon the &quot;Gulestan&quot; of Saadi

Along with his works are his contributions to previous works and works that have been created in response to his new ideas.
== Legacy ==
Shortly after Jami&#x27;s death, and with the reconfiguration of borders, the emergence of the &#x27;Persianate world&#x27; with empires such as Safavid, Uzbek, Ottoman, and Mughal: his works were disseminated as far as to regions such as the Deccan. The term &quot;Persianate world&quot;, a relatively contemporary expression, would indicate regions such as Afghanistan, Iran, and a few regions in Central Asia. However, contemporary scholars perceive the usage of this word in a more transnational fashion, i.e., also take into account all the regions wherein Persian as a language, culture, and tradition flourished and developed. For instance, the Indian subcontinent is one such region where Persian (ever since the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries) evolved and played a significant role. Not only was Persian the court language of the Mughal Empire, but it was also the language of official discourses led by intellectuals and civil society. Although the native Persian speakers of Iran always distinguished themselves from their counterparts in South Asia. The former considered themselves as superior to the latter. Despite the politics of language and geo-cultural identity, Jami was well recognised in the Indian subcontinent, during his lifetime prior to the consolidation of the Mughal Empire. This was because of Mahmud Gavan ʿImad al-Din (d. 886/1481), a Gilani migrant who was in service of the Bahman Shahs of the Deccan. Gavan invited Jami to migrate to India, but the latter politely refused citing the health issues of his mother. However, when one acquaintance was tempted to migrate, Jami asserted to not quit “the Khorasanian homeland for the black land of India”. Through both these instances, one can see Jami’s strong affinity with the Persianate land.

In the context of the Indian subcontinent, Jami&#x27;s legacy and influence in the post-Timurid period can significantly be perceived in various instances. The first Mughal emperor Zahir al-Din Babur, in his memoir Baburnama, referred to Jami as the &quot;foremost authority of the age in all of the sciences and as a poet of such renown that the mere mention of his name is a source of blessing&quot;. According to British-American professor of Persian Studies Hamid Algar, it was not Jami&#x27;s ghazals or qasidas, but masnavis such as Yusuf and Zulaykha that were thought of so eminent insofar subsequent Mughal emperors post-Babur like Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shahjahan produced their own versions of the narrative as late as the nineteenth century. Jami&#x27;s influence on the Persianized Urdu in the Indian subcontinent and many Urdu poets such as Ghalib has also been well documented in South Asia. For instance, one of Ghalib&#x27;s contemporary biographers Mehr Afshan Farooqi, while discussing the so-called Indian style or Mughal-Safavid style in the context of the history of Persian poetry, traces the Persian influence on Urdu to Baba Fighani, a pupil of Jami.

<text>A Cheveret desk is an antique desk of very small size which features a single drawer under the writing surface. In some occasions small drawers and pigeonholes are built on top, at the back, as in a smaller form of a bureau à gradin. It is also written with an &quot;S&quot;, Sheveret.

Other variants of the Cheveret are much taller and have one or two shelves built between the legs, under the main drawer. They are meant to be used standing up, being then a form of standing desk.

Cheverets were popular in the United Kingdom in the 18th century.

<doc id="420418" wikidata="Q2705385" url="?curid=420418" title="Ockham, Surrey">
<text>Ockham ( ) is a rural and semi-rural village in the borough of Guildford in Surrey, England. The village starts immediately east of the A3 but the lands extend to the River Wey in the west where it has a large mill-house. Ockham is between Cobham (near Leatherhead) and East Horsley (near Guildford).

==History==
Ockham has been occupied since at least the middle bronze age (c.1500-1100 BC), evidenced by the so-called &#x27;Ockham Hoard&#x27;. a collection of bronze-age objects discovered in 2013 during building works at the former &quot;Hautboy Inn&quot;, as well as the existence of a, relatively uncommon, bell barrow on Cockcrow Hill.

Ockham appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bocheham&quot;. Held by Richard Fitz Gilbert, its domesday assets were: 1½ hides, 1 church, 2 fisheries worth 10d, 3 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 60 hogs. It rendered £10 per year to its overlords.

Through the Middle Ages in the many records nationally (such as Assize Rolls and feet of fines), Ockham features no high nobles among its owners. However it is the birthplace of William of Ockham, the famous medieval philosopher and the proponent of Occam&#x27;s razor.

Byron&#x27;s daughter, Ada Lovelace, lived briefly at Ockham Park before settling at Horsley Towers, which her husband the 1st Earl of Lovelace built in the village of East Horsley. His forefather Sir Peter King bought the manor using an Act of Parliament to cement the deal from the long-standing lords of the manor the Weston family of Albury, Send in Surrey, and of Sussex, who had acquired the manor from distant cousins who since their late Tudor period forebear, Francis Weston, owned it along with Sutton Place, Surrey in the extreme south of the parish of Woking.

An act of charity in the village assisted one family in the &#x27;Underground Railroad&#x27; in the US that resulted from the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. After reaching Liverpool in 1850, following an arduous journey starting with a flight to freedom from Macon, Georgia, African-American slaves Ellen and William Craft were given a home by a parishioner in Ockham in 1851. They attended the Ockham School, and paid for their education by working as teachers: William giving instruction in carpentry, and Ellen in sewing. In 1852 their first child, Charles Estlin Phillips Craft, was born in Ockham. One year later, they left Ockham and returned to London. In 1871, after returning to Georgia, they started the Woodville Co-Operative Farm School, modelled after the Ockham School.

==Geology==

The soil of Ockham Common varies between fertile light clay and humus topsoil to highly acidic, sandy heath. In the north is the high, uneroded Bagshot Sand. The southern part of the parish is on the London Clay. Part of the Wey Valley in the west of the parish and the banks of a stream which joins it from the east are particularly formed from alluvium.

==Landmarks==
===Chatley Heath and its semaphore tower===

The tall, narrow Octagonal, inhabitable tower dates to the early 19th century when the Napoleonic Wars were raging.

===Ockham mill===

One of the largest formerly industrial millhouses on the Wey, comparable to the converted mills in Old Woking and that of Stoke Mill, Guildford, Ockham mill is dated 1862 and is a Grade II listed building. It is of four storeys red stock brick with decorative brick and tile bands over each floor. Providing unusual quirkiness, it has brick-dentilled eaves over its third 3 first floor and one of its windows is considered &quot;Lovelace style&quot;, i.e. with deeply inlaid recess as in the East Horsley walls of the memorials to the Earl of Lovelace.

===Wisley Airfield on Ockham Common===
Ockham Common, to the north-east of the village, is the site of the disused Wisley Airfield, which has a paved runway (RWY 10/28). As late as 1972, this airfield was in service as a satellite fit-out and flight test centre for Vickers and latterly the British Aircraft Corporation, linked to their main factory and airfield at nearby Brooklands, Weybridge, capable of taking aircraft as large as the VC10.

Although the airfield is disused, the aviation connection remains: it is the location of OCK, a VOR navigational beacon which is the holding facility for south westerly arrivals into London Heathrow Airport.

===All Saints&#x27; Church===

Ockham has a small church, All Saints&#x27;. It is a Grade I listed building. The foundations were laid in the 12th century, and part of the nave was built then. The chancel and north aisle date from the 13th century, the south nave wall from the 14th century, and the tower and north aisle wall from the 15th century. In 1735, the King Chapel was added to the church as north wing. Intended as a chapel over the family vault of the Lords King and their descendants, the Earls of Lovelace, it features several church monuments. All Saints&#x27; Church building was restored and enlarged in 1874-75 by Thomas Graham Jackson. There is also a memorial to those who gave their lives in the Great War and World War II.

===Martyrs Green===

This small linear settlement is a hamlet to the east of the village, near Downside and Cobham. It has the village&#x27;s only pub; &quot;The Black Swan&quot;.

==Sports==
Ockham has cricket and football clubs that play at weekends at Hautboy Meadows on Ockham Lane. The cricket club has two teams in the Surrey Downs League and a Sunday friendly (matches) only side. The football club are in the Guildford &amp; Woking Alliance.

Ockham was also the headquarters for the Tyrrell Formula One racing team, until its sale to British American Racing in 1997 and subsequent move to Brackley, Northamptonshire.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Namesakes==
The village gave its name to HMS &quot;Ockham&quot;, a Ham class minesweeper.

<text>The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India&#x27;s highest award in the field of cinema, given by the Government of India and presented annually at the National Film Awards. The recipient is honoured for their &quot;outstanding contribution to the growth and development of Indian cinema&quot; and is selected by a committee consisting of eminent personalities from the Indian film industry. The award comprises a &quot;Swarna Kamal&quot; (Golden Lotus) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of .

Presented first in 1969, the award was introduced by the Government of India to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke&#x27;s contribution to Indian cinema. Phalke (1870–1944), who is popularly known as and often regarded as &quot;the father of Indian cinema&quot;, was an Indian filmmaker who directed India&#x27;s first full-length feature film, &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; (1913).

The first recipient of the award was actress Devika Rani, who was honoured at the 17th National Film Awards. As of 2024, there have been 54 awardees. Among those, actors Prithviraj Kapoor (1971) and Vinod Khanna (2017) are the only posthumous recipients. Kapoor&#x27;s actor-filmmaker son, Raj Kapoor, accepted the award on his behalf at the 19th National Film Awards in 1971 and was also himself a recipient in 1987 at the 35th National Film Awards ceremony.

Recipients include several pairs of siblings received this award in different years, for example: B. N. Reddy (1974) and B. Nagi Reddy (1986); Raj Kapoor (1987) and Shashi Kapoor (2014); Lata Mangeshkar (1989) and Asha Bhosle (2000); B. R. Chopra (1998) and Yash Chopra (2001). The most recent recipient of the award is veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty who was honoured at the 70th National Film Awards ceremony.

==Recipients==

==Similarly named awards==
Several other awards and film festivals have been named after Dadasaheb Phalke, sometimes leading to confusion. Such awards include the &quot;Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival&quot;, &quot;Dadasaheb Phalke Film Foundation Awards&quot;, &quot;Dadasaheb Phalke Excellence Awards&quot;..etc. which are unrelated to the award conferred by the Directorate of Film Festivals. Some prominent filmmakers, such as Shyam Benegal, have proposed that the Government of India step in to prevent such use of the Dadasaheb Phalke name but the Information and Broadcasting ministry has said that it could not do so since the names of the new awards are not an exact copy.

<doc id="420427" wikidata="Q3544081" url="?curid=420427" title="USS Carbonero">
<text>USS &quot;Carbonero&quot; (SS/AGSS-337) was a , the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the carbonero, a salt-water fish found in the West Indies.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Carbonero&quot;′s keel was laid down on 16 December 1943 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 19 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. S.S. Murray, and commissioned on 7 February 1945.

== World War II ==

Sailing from New London, Connecticut, on 21 March 1945, &quot;Carbonero&quot; served with the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida, and conducted torpedo exercises at Balboa, Canal Zone, before arriving at Pearl Harbor on 9 May. Her first war patrol, conducted off Formosa from 26 May to 8 July, was devoted to lifeguard duty, standing by for possible rescue of aviators downed in aircraft carrier strikes. After refitting at Subic Bay, &quot;Carbonero&quot; cleared for the Gulf of Siam on 4 August, and cruising off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, sank four schooners, two sampans, and two junks, some of the small remnants of the Japanese merchant fleet. This second war patrol ended with the cease fire order on 15 August, and &quot;Carbonero&quot; put back to Subic Bay.

== 1945–1962 ==

&quot;Carbonero&quot; reported at Seattle on 22 September 1945 for operations on the West Coast. After a simulated war patrol to the Far East early in 1947, she was assigned to the Submarine Guided Missile Program, joining her sister ship as a control vessel operating out of San Diego, and Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California. Assigned to the Regulus missile program, &quot;Carbonero&quot; was re-designated an auxiliary submarine (AGSS-337) in 1949.

Fitted with the Fleet Snorkel modification package in 1951, &quot;Carbonero&quot; operated off Southern California, and occasionally in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1953 &quot;Carbonero&quot; was fitted with control equipment which enabled her to guide a missile once it passed beyond the range of the firing ship. She performed in various phases of this program including the launching of Loon missiles and the evaluation of Regulus missile guidance equipment.

On 13 May 1957, her home port shifted to Pearl Harbor. In July 1959, &quot;Carbonero&quot; became the flagship of Submarine Division 12. From that time forward &quot;Carbonero&quot; took part in local operations in Hawaiian waters plus deployments to the Western Pacific, trips to the South Pacific and mainland United States. She made an Arctic familiarization cruise in 1957, and in 1958 and 1959–1960, cruised to the Far East. She assisted in the training of forces of the Republic of Korea and of Japan, and called at ports of Japan and the Philippines during these deployments.

Early in 1962 the Regulus missile guidance equipment was removed. &quot;Carbonero&quot; returned to the standard &quot;Fleet Snorkel&quot; configuration, and was re-designated an attack submarine (SS-337).

==1962–1970==
&quot;Carbonero&quot; participated in the 1962 nuclear tests in the Central Pacific off Christmas Island and Johnston Island entitled Operation Dominic. She was on hand for the detonation of a warhead from a Polaris missile fired from in the &quot;Frigate Bird&quot; nuclear weapon test. &quot;Carbonero&quot; and were about from the detonation.

During the Vietnam War &quot;Carbonero&quot; again performed aviator lifeguard duties during trips to the Far East. During the mid 1960s while operating off Kaena Point, Oahu, &quot;Carbonero&quot; ran aground at a depth of , requiring drydock repair at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.

&quot;Carbonero&quot; also participated in the Project SHAD biological tests 65-6 Big Tom, 66-13 Half Note, and 68-71 Folded Arrow. During these tests, Bacillus globigii was released from &quot;Carbonero&quot; using a submarine-biological-disseminator. Aerosol sampling was done at various land-based stations near Oahu, Hawaii and Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station.

&quot;Carbonero&quot; was decommissioned on 1 December 1970. On 27 April 1975, she was taken to sea for one last time and used as a test target for a Mark 48 torpedo fired by the submarine off Hawaii.

== Honors and awards ==

* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service
* World War II Victory Medal
* National Defense Service Medal
* China Service Medal
* Vietnam Service Medal with two service stars for Vietnam War service
* Vietnam Cross of Gallantry (Republic of Vietnam)
* Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal (Republic of Vietnam)

One of &quot;Carbonero&quot;′s two war patrols was designated as &quot;successful.&quot;

<doc id="420428" wikidata="Q3748980" url="?curid=420428" title="Foshay Tower">
<text>The Foshay Tower, now the W Minneapolis – The Foshay hotel, is a skyscraper in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Modeled after the Washington Monument, the building was completed in 1929, months before the stock market crash in October of that year. It has 32 floors and stands high, which made it one of the tallest buildings in the Midwest for 48 years. The antenna mast extends the total height of the structure to . The building, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, is an example of Art Deco architecture. Its address is 821 Marquette Avenue, although it is set well back from the street and is actually closer to 9th Street than Marquette.

==Early skyscraper==
The Foshay Tower marked a significant landmark locally in the push skyward, as the tower was the first in the city to surpass the height of Minneapolis City Hall, completed in 1906. It remained the tallest building in Minneapolis until the IDS Center surpassed it in 1972.

Elevators served the 32-floor tower and the observation deck. The elevators were converted to automatic in 1957. The fee to ride the elevator was 50 cents from its opening in 1929 until the late 1960s. The current fee is $15.00

==Structure and interior==
As the building was designed to echo the Washington Monument, the sides of the building slope slightly inward, and each floor of the Foshay Tower is slightly smaller than the one below it. It is also unusual in that the tower is set back from the street, with a two-story structure surrounding it on the Marquette Avenue and 9th Street sides. The other two sides of the building, facing 8th Street and 2nd Avenue, are now surrounded by 121 South Eighth, which rises to 17 stories on the 2nd Avenue side and entirely obscures the views from the windows of the first seven stories of the Foshay Tower on the 2nd Avenue and 8th Street sides. Internally the building uses steel and reinforced concrete. The exterior is faced with Indiana limestone, while the interior features African mahogany, Italian marble, terrazzo, gold-plated doorknobs, a silver and gold plated ceiling, beautiful ornamental bronze entrances and work throughout the building (made by Crown Iron Works Company of Minneapolis), hand wrought iron and three commissioned busts of George Washington. It cost US$3.75 million to build. From the Marquette Avenue side of the structure, the name, &quot;Foshay,&quot; is visible in concrete four times on the exterior of the building (once on the top and three times on the street level).

==Dedication==
Foshay Tower was the lifelong dream and namesake of Wilbur Foshay, an art student turned businessman who amassed his fortune by building up three utility company empires (operating as the W. B. Foshay Company). Foshay had built it as homage to the Washington Monument. At the time the tower was being built, he had sold his previous two empires in turn and was building up his third (which was eventually to stretch from Alaska to Nicaragua). He planned to locate his business and residence on the 27th and 28th floors where a three-bedroom, three-bath suite was built, with a fireplace and library, Italian Siena marble walls and glass-paneled ceilings.

Foshay invited 25,000 guests to the dedication ceremony and provided all-expenses paid trips to many including cabinet members, senators, and congressmen. Half-nude dancers entertained. Each guest received a gold pocket watch. The military gave 19-gun salutes. John Philip Sousa conducted music, including the &quot;Foshay Tower–Washington Memorial March,&quot; a march he wrote for the occasion. Foshay presented Sousa with a check for US$20,000.

The march was only played once during Foshay&#x27;s lifetime. Six weeks after the building&#x27;s opening on November 2, 1929, Foshay&#x27;s corporate empire was thrown into receivership at the onset of the Great Depression. Ignominiously, Foshay&#x27;s check to Sousa bounced, and in retaliation, Sousa prohibited the playing of the march so long as Foshay&#x27;s debt to him remained outstanding. Foshay never lived in his new home, which also went into receivership. It wasn&#x27;t until 1988 when a group of Minnesota investors repaid Foshay&#x27;s debt to Sousa&#x27;s estate that the march was permitted to be played in public again.

==Magney &amp; Tusler==
The Foshay was designed by Léon Eugène Arnal (1881–1963), chief designer for the architects Magney &amp; Tusler, later known as Setter, Leach &amp; Lindstrom, which was acquired by Leo A. Daly in 2003.

The building has the name &quot;FOSHAY&quot; in 10 foot (3 m) lighted letters on all four sides just below the top. A U.S. patent for this display technique was filed in 1929 by Gottlieb R. Magney, Wilbur Tusler and Arnal and granted in 1931, assigned to the W. B. Foshay Co.

==Later use==
The tower was headquarters for Citizens Utilities, the successor to Foshay&#x27;s company.
In January 1981, the building was wrapped in a huge yellow ribbon during the final days of the Iran hostage crisis. Once the hostages returned to the United States, the ribbon was moved to the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul so that people could sign it. The ribbon is now in the Minnesota Historical Society.

The antenna on the roof has been used by various broadcasters, including television stations WTCN (now KARE), WCCO and KMSP. Radio station KFAI has been broadcasting from the tower since 1984, but moved their transmission tower to the IDS Center in March 2007, due to the W Hotel renovation. Around 1980, when the Foshay was still one of the tallest buildings in Minneapolis, the pyramidal top was covered with numerous pieces of radio transmitting equipment.

The structure&#x27;s street level establishments once included Cafe Un Deux Trois, notable for having Andrew Zimmern as Executive Chef for its first 4-years, and Peter&#x27;s Grill, Minneapolis&#x27;s oldest restaurant, was located across the street.

The Norwegian consulate was located in the tower until 2007, when it moved to the AT&amp;T Tower across the street.

==Conversion to W Hotel==
On September 4, 2006, it was reported that developers Ralph W. Burnet and Minneapolis-based Ryan Companies would spend as much as $90 million to convert the 32-story office tower into a 230-room W Hotel. All tenants with the exception of Keys Café on the first floor moved out.

A unique finding occurred at the tower when workers were replacing the ceiling in the hotel&#x27;s lobby. When the lobby ceiling was removed, they discovered the room&#x27;s original ceiling, complete with intricate engravings and embossed with various logos. However, due to past renovation work and age, the ceiling had deteriorated and was badly damaged. It has been reported that workers are currently in the process of restoring the original ceiling at the behest of the National Register of Historic Places, a process which will take a total of four months alone.

The renovated W Minneapolis – The Foshay opened on August 13, 2008. The hotel retains the 30th floor observation deck and converted Wilbur Foshay&#x27;s former boardroom on the 27th floor into the Prohibition Sky Bar.

<doc id="420431" wikidata="Q4114630" url="?curid=420431" title="Dead letter mail">
<text>Dead letter mail or undeliverable mail is mail that cannot be delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender. This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and return address, or the inability to forward the mail when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.

The term &quot;dead mail&quot; is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term &quot;undeliverable mail&quot; as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.

Classification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate secrecy of correspondence, ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter&#x27;s origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value. Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by Marc Chagall which turned up in a United States Postal Service sorting center in Topeka, Kansas in January 2002.

Many countries, including Canada and the United States, have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office. Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.

==Dead letter office==

A dead letter office (DLO) is a facility within a postal system where undeliverable mail is processed. Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no return address so it cannot be returned to the sender.

At a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the envelope is usually sealed using tape or postal seals, or enclosed in plastic bags and delivered. If the letter or parcel is still undeliverable, valuable items are then auctioned off while the correspondence is usually destroyed. Despite this practice, in the past some undeliverable envelopes were acquired by philatelists.

Dead letter offices go by different names in different countries. In many English-speaking countries they are called returned letter offices.

===Canada===
Canada Post sends mail which is not deliverable to the Undeliverable Mail Office (NUMO) at Mississauga, Ontario, or North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Domestic mail which is still undeliverable after passing through NUMO is then destroyed, while incoming international undeliverable mail is returned to the country of origin.

===Malta===
In Malta, undeliverable mail was sorted in the General Post Office in Valletta. The facility was initially known as the Returned Letter Branch, but later on it was also referred to as the Returned Letter Office or Dead Letter Office. Various postal markings were used at the facility from 1889 onward.

===United Kingdom===
A Dead Letter Office was first established in 1784 for dead and missent letters that had reached London. The bye-letter offices dealt with and those that did not go to London. No postage was charged for returns, which were made after six months, where an addressee was found. From 1790, a charge was made for returned letters but the time was reduced to two months by John Palmer. Upon hearing of the return charge William Pitt rescinded the charge.

In the UK, undeliverable mail is processed in the National Returns Centre in Belfast which holds 20 million undeliverable items, or in a smaller office in Portsmouth.

===United States===

The U.S. Post Office, as it was known then, started a dead letter office in 1825 to deal with undeliverable mail. By 1893, it handled about 20,000 items every day. Patti Lyle Collins was a long-time employee of the office, responsible for the redirection of an estimated 1,000 letters a day. In 2006, approximately 90 million undeliverable-as-addressed (UAA) items ended up in the dead-letter office of the U.S. Postal Service; when the rightful owners cannot be identified, the correspondence is destroyed to protect customer privacy, and enclosed items of value are removed.

These facilities are now known as mail recovery centers (MRC). Other former names include the dead letter branch and the dead parcel branch. The USPS mail recovery center is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Since April 2013, the postal auctions have been held online and include not only material lost in the U.S. but also material from other national postal authorities who consign them to the USPS for auction.

===In popular culture===

<doc id="420433" wikidata="Q5589390" url="?curid=420433" title="Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos">
<text>Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (20 March 1776 – 17 January 1839), styled Earl Temple from 1784 to 1813 and known as the Marquess of Buckingham from 1813 to 1822, was a British landowner and politician.

==Background==
Born Richard Temple-Nugent-Grenville, he was the eldest son of George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham, son of George Grenville, Prime Minister of Great Britain. His mother was Lady Mary Nugent, daughter of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent. Thomas Grenville and Lord Grenville were his uncles.

He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1791.

==Political career==
Earl Temple, as he was known in his father&#x27;s lifetime, was elected Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire in 1797. In 1806, he was made a Privy Counsellor and appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Joint Paymaster of the Forces in the Ministry of All the Talents headed by his uncle, Lord Grenville. He retained these posts until the fall of the Grenville administration in 1807. He left the House of Commons in 1813 when he succeeded his father in the marquessate. In 1820, he was appointed a Knight of the Garter. In 1822, he was further honoured when he was made Earl Temple of Stowe, with remainder to his granddaughter Anne Eliza Mary, and Marquess of Chandos and Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, with normal remainder to heirs male. He returned to ministerial office in July 1830 when he was made Lord Steward of the Household, but only held the post for a short while. Apart from his political career, he was also Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire from 1813 to 1839.

Buckingham also owned a plantation in Jamaica and in Britain, including thirty-eight properties in the Old Nichol. Nicknames such as &quot;Lord Grenville&#x27;s fat nephew&quot;, Ph D (&quot;Phat Duke&quot;), and the &quot;gros Marquis&quot;, attested to his size and unpopularity.

==Family==
In April 1796, aged 20, the then Earl Temple married the Lady Anne Brydges, daughter and sole heir of the late James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos. Accordingly, Nugent-Temple-Grenville added Brydges and Chandos to their family names (and those of their children) by royal licence of 15 November 1799; their full family name became the remarkable &quot;quintuple&quot;-barrelled Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville. His wife died in 1836 and he died in January 1839, aged 62, and he was succeeded by his son, Richard.

<doc id="420438" wikidata="Q194045" url="?curid=420438" title="Steven Tyler">
<text>Steven Victor Tallarico (born March 26, 1948), known professionally as Steven Tyler, is an American singer and songwriter, best known as the lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith, in which he also plays the keyboards, harmonica and percussion. He has been called the &quot;Demon of Screamin&#x27;&quot; due to his high screams and his powerful wide vocal range. He is also known for his on-stage acrobatics. During his performances, Tyler usually dresses in colorful, sometimes androgynous outfits and makeup with his trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand.

In the 1970s, Tyler rose to prominence as the lead singer of Aerosmith, which released such hard rock albums as &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot;, along with a string of hit singles, including &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyler had a heavy drug and alcohol addiction and the band&#x27;s popularity waned. In 1986, Tyler completed drug rehabilitation and Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Joe Perry joined Run-DMC for a re-make of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, which became a Top 5 hit. Aerosmith subsequently launched a comeback with the multi-platinum albums &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot;, &quot;Get a Grip&quot; and &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, which produced a combined thirteen Top 40 singles and won the band numerous awards. During this time, the band embarked on their longest concert tours, promoted their singles with conceptual music videos, and made appearances in television, film and video games.

Since the late 1980s, Tyler has embarked on several solo endeavors, including guest appearances with musicians including Alice Cooper, Mötley Crüe, Santana, Pink and Keith Anderson, film and TV work, authoring a book, and solo music, including the Top 40 single &quot;(It) Feels So Good&quot; in 2011. Tension with his Aerosmith bandmates arose in 2009 and 2010 after he fell off the stage at a concert, and had a relapse with prescription drugs, receiving treatment in 2009. He also signed on to &quot;American Idol&quot; without telling the other members of the band. Nonetheless, Tyler has continued to record music and perform with Aerosmith, after more than 50 years as a member of the group. In 2016, he released his debut solo album, &quot;We&#x27;re All Somebody from Somewhere&quot;, a country rock album that included the single &quot;Love Is Your Name&quot;. Tyler supported the album with the &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; tour. Tyler continues to perform both solo, with backing from the Loving Mary Band, and with Aerosmith.

Tyler is included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of 100 greatest singers. He was ranked third on &quot;Hit Parader&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Aerosmith and in 2013, Tyler and his songwriting partner Joe Perry received the ASCAP Founders Award and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Steven Victor Tallarico was born on March 26, 1948, at the Stuyvesant Polyclinic in Manhattan, New York, and moved to the Bronx when he was three years old. The family relocated to 100 Pembrook Drive in Northeast Yonkers in 1957 when he was about nine years old. Tallarico is the son of Susan Ray (; June 2, 1925July 4, 2008), a secretary, and Victor A. Tallarico (May 14, 1916September 10, 2011), a classical musician and pianist who taught music at Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.

Tyler&#x27;s father was of Italian and German descent, while his mother was of Polish, English and African-American ancestry. He has claimed on a number of occasions that his maternal grandfather was Ukrainian, and changed his surname from &quot;Czarnyszewicz&quot; (from ) to &quot;Blancha&quot; (possibly from ). Genealogist Megan Smolenyak established that Steven Tyler&#x27;s grandfather was Polish, born Felix Czarnyszewicz in 1892 in Klichaw, in today&#x27;s Belarus. In 1914 he emigrated to the US and changed his surname to Blancha. There he married Bessie Elliott, with whom he had four children, including Steven&#x27;s mother Susan. Felix&#x27;s brother was Florian Czarnyszewicz, a well-known Polish writer who emigrated to Argentina. Florian Czarnyszewicz is best known for his novel &quot;Nadberezeńcy&quot; which describes the fate of Poles living in the lands between the Berezina and Dnieper rivers between 1911 and 1920.

His paternal grandfather, Giovanni Tallarico, was from Cotronei, Calabria, Italy. Tyler learned on the genealogy show &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; that his maternal great-great-great-grandfather Robert Elliot was part African-American and part European-American. Steven has one older sister named Lynda.

Tyler attended Roosevelt High School on Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers, New York which was about a mile from his house, but was expelled from the school just before graduation due to marijuana use. He later graduated from Quintano School for Young Professionals.

At 17, Tyler spent time in Greenwich Village, New York, the highlight of which was seeing a Rolling Stones concert. Tyler states that he and his friends &quot;hung around for a while, buzzing like crazy just because we got to touch them.&quot; He added, &quot;Everybody told me that I looked just like Mick Jagger with my big lips and Keith Richards basically was the music I used to love more than anything.&quot; A photo in the band&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Walk This Way&quot; shows Tyler standing behind Mick Jagger outside a hotel.

During this period, Tyler sang backing vocals on &quot;The Left Banke Too&quot;, the second album by baroque pop group the Left Banke.

== Career ==

=== Formation and success of Aerosmith (1970–1978) ===

Before Aerosmith, Tyler wrote what would become one of Aerosmith&#x27;s signature songs, &quot;Dream On&quot;. In 1969, Tyler attended a local rock show in Sunapee, New Hampshire, where he first saw future bandmates Joe Perry (guitars) and Tom Hamilton (bass), who at the time were playing in a band called the Jam Band. Tyler later stated he was struck by their raw power and attitude.

Around 1970, Tyler, Perry and Hamilton decided to form a band. Tyler, who had played drums in many of his previous bands while in school, insisted that he would be the frontman and lead singer. Joey Kramer, an old acquaintance of Tyler&#x27;s from New York, was recruited to play the drums. Tyler invited his boyhood friend, Ray Tabano, to play rhythm guitar. Driven by a collective ambition to launch their careers as full-time musicians and hopeful recording artists, the band moved to the Boston area, and shared a small apartment at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Allston in the fall of 1970.

Shortly after relocating to Boston, Tyler&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Tabano&#x27;s lack of passion and dedication prompted the band to replace Tabano with Brad Whitford. Although Tyler was never billed as the &quot;leader&quot; of Aerosmith, he co-managed, with drummer Joey Kramer, the assets of the band and directed its activities during this formative period.

After spending time on the Boston club circuit under the tutelage of their first manager, Frank Connelly, the band began working with New York managers Steve Leber and David Krebs. Leber describes the band as &quot;the closest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen to the Rolling Stones&quot;. In early 1972, the managers arranged the gig at the legendary nightclub Max&#x27;s Kansas City to showcase the group to record company executives. They subsequently signed a record deal with Columbia Records in 1972 and released their eponymous debut album in 1973. This was followed by their second album, &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; in 1974.

Around this time, Aerosmith continued to tour wherever they could and opened for bands like Mott the Hoople. The band had a minor hit in &quot;Dream On&quot;, which peaked at number 59 in 1973, but Aerosmith did not break into the mainstream until the back-to-back releases of their next sets of albums, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rocks&quot; (1976). In 1975, they achieved their first top-40 hit in &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;. Soon after, &quot;Dream On&quot; was re-released and hit number six in 1976, followed by another top-10 hit &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Rocks&quot; produced the hit singles &quot;Last Child&quot;, &quot;Back in the Saddle&quot; and &quot;Home Tonight&quot;.

By 1976, Aerosmith found themselves headlining huge stadiums and major rock music festivals. That year, Tyler emerged as a prominent rock star and sex symbol in his own right, gracing the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, catapulted them to international fame and recognition, launching tours in Europe and Japan. A series of Hot 100 hits continued throughout the remainder of the decade, including &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; and &quot;Chip Away the Stone&quot;. Aerosmith&#x27;s first five albums have 
all since gone multiplatinum and all five are considered to be among the greatest hard rock albums of all time.

Aerosmith toured heavily throughout the mid- to late 1970s, and their live shows during this time period were captured through 1978&#x27;s live album &quot;Live! Bootleg&quot; and the 1989 VHS release &quot;Live Texxas Jam &#x27;78&quot;. Also in 1978, Tyler made his acting debut as the leader of the Future Villain Band in the film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, alongside his Aerosmith bandmates. The film also spawned Aerosmith&#x27;s cover of the Beatles hit &quot;Come Together&quot;, which was Aerosmith&#x27;s last top-40 single for nine years.

=== Decline of Aerosmith (1979–1983) ===
As the decade wore on, the fast-paced life of touring, recording, living together and using drugs began to take its toll on the band. Tyler and Perry often were called the Toxic Twins for their legendary intake of stimulants and heroin. Their relationship is well documented in many of Aerosmith&#x27;s video releases, as well as in the Aerosmith &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. On July 28, 1979, after a huge quarrel at a World Series of Rock concert in Cleveland, Perry left Aerosmith to begin his own band, the Joe Perry Project. &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot; was released that fall, and Aerosmith forged on with new guitarist Jimmy Crespo.

In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a motorcycle crash that left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record for much of 1981. When the band reconvened in the studio, Tyler formed a writing partnership with Crespo, co-writing and producing the album &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; (1982). Brad Whitford had left in 1981, shortly after recording the guitar parts for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;. Whitford was replaced by Rick Dufay, and the band continued to tour into 1983.

As the decade wore on, Tyler&#x27;s drug abuse increased. His heroin addiction was at its worst between 1979 and 1982, when he would roam the streets of New York City looking for dealers. &quot;I made like $4 or $5 million by 1979,&quot; he recalled, &quot;and by &#x27;83… I lost it all. I remember in the early days looking at another fucked-up rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star and thinking, &#x27;I will never end up like that, man.&#x27; They had all these riches and blew it all. That would never happen to me… I forgot about reality and just loved shooting dope and coke. Stupid.&quot;

=== Reuniting and getting clean (1984–1986) ===
On February 14, 1984, Perry and Whitford, who left the band in 1979 and 1981, respectively, attended an Aerosmith show. According to the band&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; special on VH1, Tyler alleged that he made the first phone call to Perry, encouraging them to meet up again. Backstage, they all met and Perry and Whitford agreed to join the band once again. With the new reunion, the band also fired their managers Leber and Krebs, hired new manager Tim Collins (who was managing Joe Perry), and signed a new record contract with Geffen Records. Aerosmith embarked on a reunion tour, the Back in the Saddle Tour, and recorded once again, releasing &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; in 1985. However, the band was still using drugs, especially Tyler, who collapsed while performing in Springfield, Illinois, on the 1984 tour. In 1986, the band held a meeting in which the band members staged an intervention on Tyler, and persuaded him to enter a drug rehabilitation program. After he completed rehabilitation, his bandmates did likewise; all had completed treatment by the mid-1980s.

=== Comeback and superstardom (1986–1999) ===
Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Perry appeared on Run–D.M.C.&#x27;s cover of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Walk This Way&quot; in 1986, a track that combined elements of hip-hop and rock, that broke down the barriers between the two genres, broke rap into the mainstream, and introduced Aerosmith to a new generation. The track hit number four on the charts and launched a famous music video that had heavy rotation. This paved the way for Aerosmith to mount a significant comeback. Tyler and Perry renewed their songwriting partnership, but were also working with outside songwriting collaborators brought in by the record company, such as Desmond Child and Jim Vallance. To give Aerosmith a slick sound accessible to mainstream audiences, they received help from producer Bruce Fairbairn. Aerosmith released &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; in 1987, which became a huge multiplatinum success and launched three top-20 hits (&quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Rag Doll&quot;). The band launched a tour with the emerging Guns N&#x27; Roses, opening many shows. &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; was followed by 1989&#x27;s &quot;Pump&quot;, which was even more successful, selling 7 million copies and producing three top-10 hits (&quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; and &quot;What it Takes&quot;) and one top-40 hit (&quot;The Other Side&quot;). &quot;Pump&quot; in particular had Tyler expand his musical horizons, co-writing the innovative hit &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, which won the first Grammy award for the band. The band toured with many emerging acts and performed in locations such as Australia for the first time. In the late 1980s, Tyler also guested on albums by comedian Sam Kinison, Alice Cooper (a fellow &#x27;70s rocker also launching a successful comeback) and popular contemporaries Mötley Crüe. Around that time, Tyler and Perry appeared at a Bon Jovi concert in Milton Keynes and performed &quot;Walk This Way&quot;.

With the twin successes of &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; and &quot;Pump&quot;, the band became an MTV sensation and Tyler became a household name. The band was featured on a &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1990, which was listed by E! in 2004 as &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s most unforgettable moment. That same year, Aerosmith recorded one of the first episodes of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. In 1991, Aerosmith was one of the first bands to be featured on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. That year, the band also signed a $30 million record deal with their old label Columbia, for which they would begin recording the following year. The box set &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was released by Columbia in late 1991, and the band filmed a music video for &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; to promote the release. Earlier in the year, the band also performed &quot;Dream On&quot; with an orchestra at MTV&#x27;s 10th Anniversary celebration; their filmed performance was used as the official video for the song. After a brief break, the band returned to the studio in 1992 to record their next album. The band&#x27;s A&amp;R man John Kalodner criticized some of the early material being considered for this album, targeting Tyler&#x27;s sexually profane lyrics in particular.

However, the band eventually began recording again and released &quot;Get a Grip&quot; in 1993, which became their most successful album worldwide, selling over 15 million copies and producing a series of hit singles (&quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;). While the album had mixed reviews and received some criticism for over-using outside collaborators, Aerosmith won more awards during this time than any other, winning two Grammy Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, two American Music Awards, a People&#x27;s Choice award and a &quot;Billboard&quot; Award. The band became well known for their videos at this time, which featured film-like storylines and up-and-coming actors and actresses such as Edward Furlong, Stephen Dorff, Jason London, Josh Holloway and most notably Alicia Silverstone. Tyler&#x27;s daughter Liv made her acting debut in the band&#x27;s video for &quot;Crazy&quot; in 1994. The band also launched their biggest and most extensive tour yet, performing over 240 shows in nearly 30 countries, including touring Latin America for the first time and performing in many European countries for the first time.

After the 18-month Get a Grip Tour ended in December 1994, the band took a break in 1995 to spend time with their families. They needed to rest due to the grueling lifestyle of the previous 10 years under the helm of manager Tim Collins, who helped orchestrate much of the band&#x27;s comeback and sustained success. Tyler and Perry also began writing for a new album, and the band performed a couple of one-off shows in Boston to try out the new material. They also vacationed together with their families in Florida. Aerosmith, however, almost broke up after Tim Collins spread rumors that band members were deriding each other and that Tyler was being unfaithful to his wife and using drugs again during recording sessions in Miami. The band subsequently fired Collins in 1996 in the middle of recording for their next album. In 1997, they released &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, which went double platinum, launched three hits (&quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot;, &quot;Hole in My Soul&quot; and &quot;Pink&quot;), and won the band their fourth Grammy for &quot;Pink&quot;. They toured for over two years in support of the album. In 1997, Tyler and Perry were featured in a commercial for the GAP. That fall, the band&#x27;s tell-all autobiography was released.

In 1998, while on tour in support of &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, Tyler suffered a ligament injury when a microphone stand fell hard onto his knee. Tyler and the band finished the show, but they had to cancel several dates, and Tyler had to wear a leg cast while filming the video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;. The song was the band&#x27;s first number-one hit and the only song to date by a rock band to debut at number one on the Hot 100. It has since become a slow-dance staple, and at the time introduced Aerosmith and Steven Tyler to yet another new generation. The song was written for the film &quot;Armageddon&quot;, which featured Tyler&#x27;s daughter Liv. In 1999, Tyler and Perry joined Kid Rock and Run–D.M.C. to perform &quot;Walk This Way&quot; at the MTV Video Music Awards. Earlier that year, the band had the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith open at Walt Disney World.

=== Continued success and touring (2000–2008) ===

In 2001, Aerosmith played at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band released the album &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, which featured the top-10 hit &quot;Jaded&quot;. At the 2001 Indianapolis 500, Tyler sang the National Anthem in traditional Aerosmith style – complete with a raspy voice, bluesy swagger and a hard rocker yell. When Tyler sang the National Anthem, he changed the words which caused a public outcry. Instead of singing &quot;Land of the free and the home of the brave&quot;, he changed the words to &quot;Land of the free and the home of the Indianapolis 500.&quot; This received negative reactions from veterans and fans, leading Tyler to issue a public apology.
In 2002, Aerosmith&#x27;s two-hour-long &quot;Behind the Music&quot; was released, chronicling the band&#x27;s tumultuous history and current activities and touring. They were also honored as MTV Icons. In the summer, they released the compilation &quot;O, Yeah! The Ultimate Aerosmith Hits&quot;, which went double platinum and included the new track &quot;Girls of Summer&quot;.

In 2003, Tyler received an honorary degree from Berklee College of Music, and in 2005, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Massachusetts Boston. In 2003, he inducted AC/DC into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Later in the year, he went on tour with Aerosmith for the Rocksimus Maximus Tour with KISS. In 2004, Aerosmith released the blues cover album &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; and launched a brief tour with Cheap Trick, focused on smaller markets. Tyler sang the National Anthem to kick off the 2004 World Series at Fenway Park. The 2004 film &quot;The Polar Express&quot; featured Tyler singing &quot;Rockin&#x27; on Top of the World&quot; alongside a group of animated elves resembling Aerosmith.

In 2005, Tyler sang lead vocals on Santana&#x27;s hit single &quot;Just Feel Better&quot; and made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Be Cool&quot;. In 2006, after recovering from throat surgery and the grueling Rockin&#x27; the Joint Tour, Tyler performed with Joe Perry and the Boston Pops Orchestra for the orchestra&#x27;s annual Fourth of July concert, his first major public appearance since the surgery. That year, Tyler recorded a duet with country music artist Keith Anderson, titled &quot;Three Chord Country and American Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

Later that year, the Aerosmith compilation &quot;Devil&#x27;s Got a New Disguise&quot; was released, which included two new tracks. Tyler hit the road with Aerosmith again for the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe and also made several more public appearances. He made a cameo appearance on the sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, playing himself. On October 14, 2006, Tyler sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch at game three of the National League Championship Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Mets at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. On November 24, he volunteered by serving Thanksgiving dinner to the needy at a restaurant in West Palm Beach, Florida, before an Aerosmith show there. In 2007, Tyler kept active in Aerosmith with the band&#x27;s world tour which had them perform in 19 countries. That same year, Steven and Liv Tyler were profiled on &quot;E! True Hollywood Story.&quot;

On May 21, 2008, Tyler checked into Las Encinas Hospital rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, California, to recover from multiple leg surgeries. He made a public statement saying, &quot;The &#x27;foot repair&#x27; pain was intense, greater than I&#x27;d anticipated. The months of rehabilitative care and the painful strain of physical therapy were traumatic. I really needed a safe environment to recuperate where I could shut off my phone and get back on my feet.&quot; In June 2008, &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot; was released, the franchise&#x27;s first video game based solely around one band and the most successful game based around a band. On July 14, 2008, Tyler&#x27;s mother, Susan Tallarico, died at age 84.

On July 18, 2008, Tyler appeared with Billy Joel at the last concert to be played at Shea Stadium. Backed by Joel&#x27;s band, he sang lead vocals on &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. In August 2008, HarperCollins won an auction to publish Tyler&#x27;s autobiography. That same month, Tyler performed with trumpeter Chris Botti in Boston. The concert was released as a CD/DVD, &quot;Chris Botti In Boston&quot; in March 2009. In December 2008, Tyler made a surprise appearance at the Trans-Siberian Orchestra concerts at Nassau Coliseum (December 12, 2008) and the Izod Center (December 13, 2008). At the Izod Center, he collaborated with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra on &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;.

=== Touring, &quot;American Idol&quot; and albums (2009–2014) ===

On August 5, 2009, while on the Guitar Hero Aerosmith Tour, Tyler fell off a stage near Sturgis, South Dakota, injuring his head and neck and breaking his shoulder. He was airlifted to Rapid City Regional Hospital. Aerosmith was forced to cancel the rest of their 2009 tour, except for two shows in Hawaii in October.

On November 9, 2009, the media reported that Tyler had no contact with the other members of Aerosmith and that they were unsure if he was still in the band. On November 10, 2009, Joe Perry confirmed Tyler had quit Aerosmith to pursue a solo career and was unsure whether the move was indefinite. No replacement was announced. Despite rumors of leaving the band, and notwithstanding Perry&#x27;s comment as reported earlier the same day, Tyler joined the Joe Perry Project onstage November 10, 2009, at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza and performed &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. According to sources at the event, Tyler assured the crowd that despite rumors to the contrary, he is &quot;not quitting Aerosmith.&quot;

On December 22, 2009, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Tyler had checked into rehab for pain management. In 2010, he embarked on the Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock Tour with Aerosmith, which had them perform over 40 concerts in 18 countries. On September 16, 2010, it was reported he would have his first solo project. He wrote &quot;Love Lives&quot;, a theme song for the Japanese sci-fi movie &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;. The song was based on the English translated script, as well as on some clips of the film itself. The single was released on November 24, a week before the movie was released.

On September 22, 2010, Fox confirmed that Tyler would replace Simon Cowell as a judge for the tenth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; alongside Randy Jackson and fellow new judge Jennifer Lopez (who replaced Kara DioGuardi and Ellen DeGeneres). In December 2010, Tyler performed at the Kennedy Center Honors, honoring Paul McCartney by performing several tracks from &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

On January 19, 2011, Tyler made his debut appearance as a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot; during the premiere of the show&#x27;s 10th season, which aired through the end of May. On April 2, 2011, Tyler presented an award at the 2011 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. The following day, he performed with Carrie Underwood at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Underwood and Tyler performed Underwood&#x27;s song &quot;Undo It&quot; and completed their segment with an energetic version of the Aerosmith classic &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. On May 3, 2011, he released his autobiography &quot;Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?&quot;, which reached number two on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List in the category Hardcover Non-fiction. The book was accompanied by the new single &quot;(It) Feels So Good&quot;, released May 10. The single reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In addition, during breaks in between &quot;Idol&quot;, Tyler worked on new material for Aerosmith&#x27;s next studio album. Tyler performed the Aerosmith song &quot;Dream On&quot; on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; on May 25. In September 2011, he starred as the inspiration for Andy Hilfiger&#x27;s fashion line, &quot;Andrew Charles&quot;. Tyler developed a signature scarf collection called &quot;Rock Scarf&quot; for Andrew Charles.

On October 22, 2011, Tyler set off for an 18-date Aerosmith tour across Latin America and Japan. On October 25, it was reported by TMZ that Tyler slipped in his hotel shower in Paraguay and injured his face, including losing several teeth. Tyler was rushed to the hospital, and the scheduled show was postponed for the following night. When he did finally perform after the opening song, he proudly displayed his broken tooth which he had on a string around his neck. He then removed his sunglasses to reveal a nasty black eye.
On January 22, 2012, Tyler sang the National Anthem at the AFC Championship Game. On March 11, 2012, a special about Aerosmith aired on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, where some of the comments made by the band members highlighted the still-contentious relationships in the band. On March 22, Perry surprised Tyler with a performance of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on &quot;American Idol&quot; in advance of Tyler&#x27;s 64th birthday. On March 26, 2012, Aerosmith announced their &quot;Global Warming Tour&quot; with dates in many major North American cities from June 16 to August 8, preceded by a performance on May 30 for Walmart shareholders. In April, a Burger King television commercial featuring Tyler debuted. Aerosmith&#x27;s new album, &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot; was set for release on November 6, 2012 and the band debuted their new single &quot;Legendary Child&quot; with a performance of the song on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; on May 23.

On July 12, 2012, Tyler announced that he would be leaving &quot;American Idol&quot; after two seasons, with a statement saying, &quot;After some long ... hard ... thoughts ... I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time for me to let go of my mistress &#x27;American Idol&#x27; before she boils my rabbit. I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I&#x27;m back — but instead of begging on my hands and knees, I got two fists in the air and I&#x27;m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass — the ultimate in auditory takeover ...&quot; However, the reports suggest that Tyler was dumped by the &quot;American Idol&quot; bosses. Tyler has since indicated that his troubles with his bandmates were the primary reason he signed up to do &quot;American Idol&quot;. He was replaced by Keith Urban.
On August 12, Aerosmith wrapped up the first leg of their Global Warming Tour with a rescheduled performance in Bristow, Virginia, and on August 28, the band released two singles simultaneously, the rocker &quot;Lover Alot&quot; and the ballad &quot;What Could Have Been Love&quot;, both of which were coproduced and cowritten by Tyler. On September 22, Aerosmith performed at the iHeartRadio music festival in Las Vegas. On November 6, the new Aerosmith album &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot; was released, and on November 8, the band began the second leg of their Global Warming Tour, which took the band to 14 North American cities through December 13. On January 21, 2013, Aerosmith released &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Lovin&#x27; You&quot; (featuring Carrie Underwood) as the fourth single from &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;. He briefly returned to &quot;American Idol&quot; in season 12, auditioning dressed up as a woman named &quot;Pepper&quot; in front of the judges (Randy Jackson, Nicki Minaj, Keith Urban and Mariah Carey).

On February 20, it was announced that Tyler and his songwriting partner Joe Perry would be recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award at the society&#x27;s 30th Annual Pop Music Awards on April 17. Two days later, it was announced that the duo would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame at a ceremony to be held on June 13.

In late April and early May 2013, Aerosmith extended their Global Warming Tour to Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Singapore. This marked the band&#x27;s first performances in Australia in 23 years, and the band&#x27;s first-ever performances in the latter three countries. While down-under in April 2013, Tyler told New Zealand media of his &quot;dear Maori friends&quot; and why the band had opted only to play Dunedin for their first New Zealand concert date. He also confessed to having the hots for J-Lo (Jennifer Lopez) while working on &quot;American Idol&quot; and told of how it turned out to be one of the best things he ever did. Tyler also appeared in Moscow, Russia, on November 9 for the Miss Universe 2013 pageant as one of the judges and performed &quot;Dream On&quot;. On May 30, Aerosmith performed as part of the &quot;Boston Strong&quot; charity concert for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. The band also performed at a handful of shows in the U.S. and Japan in July and August In the fall of 2013, Aerosmith extended their tour to Central and South America, including their first-ever performances in Guatemala, El Salvador and Uruguay.

From May 17 to June 28, 2014, Tyler performed 15 shows with Aerosmith on the European leg of the Global Warming Tour. This was followed by the Let Rock Rule Tour (featuring Slash with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators as the opening act), which sent Aerosmith to 19 locations across North America from July 10 to September 12.

=== Solo album and touring with Aerosmith (2015–present) ===

On March 31, 2015, Tyler stated that he was working on his first solo country album. On April 6, it was announced that he signed a record deal with Scott Borchetta&#x27;s Dot Records (a division of the Big Machine Label Group). On May 13, Tyler released the lead single, &quot;Love Is Your Name&quot;, from his forthcoming debut album. He promoted the song on &quot;the Bobby Bones Show&quot;, iHeartMedia, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and the &quot;American Idol&quot; season-14 finale. To increase his exposure to the country audience, Tyler appeared as himself in an episode of the musical drama series &quot;Nashville&quot;, performing a cover of &quot;Crazy&quot; with Juliette Barnes (portrayed by Hayden Panettiere).

On June 13, Tyler rejoined his Aerosmith bandmates for the Blue Army Tour, which sent the band to 17 North American locations through August 7; this was followed by a one-off performance in Moscow on September 5. From the fall of 2015 through the spring of 2016, Tyler completed work on his solo album, &quot;We&#x27;re All Somebody from Somewhere&quot;, which was released on July 15, 2016. A second single, &quot;Red, White &amp; You&quot;, was released in January 2016, followed by the third single (the title track) in June 2016. From July through September 2016, Tyler will be performing with his backing band Loving Mary on the 19-date Out on a Limb Tour; this was preceded by a pair of performances in Niagara Falls in March 2016 and a benefit show for his charity Janie&#x27;s Fund in New York City in May 2016.

Since December 2015, in various interviews, Tyler and fellow Aerosmith bandmates Brad Whitford and Joe Perry all discussed the possibility of an Aerosmith farewell tour or &quot;wind-down tour&quot; slated to start in 2017. Perry has suggested the tour could last for two years and Tyler said it could potentially last &quot;forever&quot;; Tyler and Whitford also discussed the potential of doing one last studio album.
From September through October 2016, Tyler rejoined Aerosmith for a nine-date tour of Latin America, called the Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Rumble Tour, preceded by a performance at the Kaaboo Festival in San Diego.

In April 2017, Tyler performed with Aerosmith in Phoenix, Arizona for the NCAA Final Four men&#x27;s basketball tournament and also performed two solo shows with Loving Mary in Japan. Tyler rejoined Aerosmith for a &quot;farewell&quot; tour of Europe in the spring and summer of 2017, titled the Aero-Vederci Baby! Tour. After the European leg concluded in July, the band played in South America in September and October 2017 The last few dates of the tour had to be canceled, however, due to health issues. Tyler also performed a handful of solo shows in 2017 with the Loving Mary Band.

In January 2018, Tyler hosted an inaugural red carpet gala for his charity &quot;Janie&#x27;s Fund&quot; during the 60th Grammy Awards. In February, he starred in a commercial for Kia Motors that aired during Super Bowl LII; the ad featured Tyler as a race car driver that went back in time, set to the soundtrack of the Aerosmith classic &quot;Dream On&quot;. In the spring and summer of 2018, Tyler played approximately two dozen concerts across North America and Europe with the Loving Mary Band as his backing band.

On August 15, Tyler appeared with Aerosmith on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show to announce a residency in Las Vegas called &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot;, a reference to both Las Vegas casino gambling and their 1994 single of the same name. The band was booked to play 50 shows from April 2019 thru June 2020 at the Park Theater. In July and August 2019, it performed at a festival in Minnesota and played nine shows at three MGM venues in Maryland, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

In March 2022, Aerosmith announced the return of the Deuces Are Wild residency, which was set to begin in June. On May 24, 2022, the band announced that the June and July dates would be canceled due to Tyler checking himself into a rehab facility. The band shared that Tyler relapsed after having foot surgery to prepare for the upcoming shows.

In August 2024, Aerosmith announced the band&#x27;s retirement from touring due to Tyler being unable to fully recover from a fractured larynx.

== Dirico Motorcycles (Red Wing Motorcycles) ==
On September 15, 2007, at New Hampshire International Speedway, Tyler announced the launch of Dirico Motorcycles, which are designed by Tyler, engineered by Mark Dirico, and built by AC Custom Motorcycles in Manchester, New Hampshire. Tyler has been a long-time motorcycle fan and riding enthusiast,
Steven Tyler also participates in a variety of charity auctions involving motorcycles, including the Ride for Children charity.

== Politics ==
In the early months of 2013, an act was forwarded into the Hawaii legislature entitled the Steven Tyler Act (Hawaii Senate Bill 465). The act would give more privacy to public figures such as government officials and celebrities on vacation. Tyler and numerous other celebrities all lobbied for it. The legislation would give public figures the right to sue paparazzi for taking unwanted photographs. The bill&#x27;s sponsor is Maui state legislator J. Kalani English. The bill was cleared through the Judiciary Committee on Friday, February 8, 2013.

In August 2015, Aerosmith attended the first Republican Party presidential debate held in Cleveland, as the band was in town for a Pro Bowl concert appearance. Tyler was reportedly a guest of candidate Donald Trump, rather than sitting with the band. Tyler&#x27;s agent told reporters that he was there to promote his copyright reform ideas.

== Personal life ==

=== Persona ===
Tyler has been known to have an androgynous persona both on and offstage such as flamboyant clothes and makeup. In his 2011 memoir &quot;Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?&quot;, Tyler wrote:

=== Family and relationships ===
Tyler had a brief relationship with fashion model Bebe Buell, during which he fathered actress Liv Tyler, born in 1977. Buell initially claimed that the father was Todd Rundgren to protect her daughter from Tyler&#x27;s drug addiction. Through Liv&#x27;s marriage to British musician Royston Langdon and relationship with entertainment manager David Gardner, Tyler has three grandchildren.

In 1978, he married Cyrinda Foxe, an ex-Warhol model and the former wife of New York Dolls&#x27; lead singer David Johansen, and fathered model Mia Tyler (born on December 22, 1978). He and Foxe divorced in 1987; in 1997, she published &quot;Dream On: Livin&#x27; on the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith&quot;, a memoir of her life with Tyler. Foxe died from a brain tumor in 2002.

On May 28, 1988, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tyler married clothing designer Teresa Barrick. With Barrick, he fathered a daughter, Chelsea, in 1989 and a son, Taj, in 1991. In February 2005, the couple announced that they were separating due to personal problems.
The divorce was finalized in January 2006. Tyler began a relationship with Erin Brady in 2006. They got engaged in December 2011 but called it off in January 2013.

==== Julia Holcomb ====
In 1973, Tyler obtained guardianship of 16-year-old Julia Holcomb so that she could live with him in Boston. They dated and took drugs together for three years. Holcomb was referred to by the pseudonym &quot;Diana Hall&quot; by the editor of the Aerosmith autobiography &quot;Walk This Way&quot; in an attempt to conceal her identity, but other sources have confirmed her identity. Pressures leading to their split included their age difference (Tyler was 25 when they first met), a withdrawn marriage proposal, a house fire, and a planned pregnancy that resulted in an abortion when Tyler was worried that the smoke from the fire, as well as drugs, might lead to birth defects. &quot;Look Away&quot;, a documentary about sexual abuse in the rock music industry, features Holcomb&#x27;s story.

Band member Ray Tabano wrote in &quot;Walk This Way&quot; that the abortion &quot;really messed Steven up,&quot; because the fetus was male. Tyler wrote, &quot;It was a big crisis. It&#x27;s a major thing when you&#x27;re growing something with a woman, but they convinced us that it would never work out and would ruin our lives. You go to the doctor and they put the needle in her belly and they squeeze the stuff in and you watch. And it comes out dead. I was pretty devastated. In my mind, I&#x27;m going, Jesus, what have I done?&quot; Holcomb stated in 2011 that after the operation, Tyler had informed her that the child &quot;had been born alive and allowed to die&quot;.

Holcomb, who later took the name &quot;Julia Misley,&quot; filed suit in December 2022, alleging that Tyler sexually assaulted her and forced her to undergo the abortion, plying her with drugs and alcohol after promising to care for her in the guardianship agreement. In February 2023, Tyler was officially named a defendant in the lawsuit, which also claimed he used his fame and status to &quot;groom, manipulate, exploit, [and] sexually assault&quot; Misley over the course of three years, beginning when she was 16 and he was in his mid-20s. In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit that was filed in March 2023, Tyler claimed their relationship was consensual and that he had immunity because he was her legal guardian at the time. The motion further stated that Tyler&#x27;s actions with regards to the abortion decision were legitimate, justified, and in good faith. Tyler&#x27;s 2023 denial of sexual assault and claim of immunity has drawn scrutiny and has perplexed several attorneys who were experts in the field of sexual assault. On reviewing Tyler&#x27;s answer to the suit launched against him that same year, the victim&#x27;s lawyer claimed that Tyler was &quot;gaslighting&quot;.

After the release of the documentary &quot;Look Away&quot;, it was discussed on Instagram by Courtney Love, where she supported some of the claims made, commenting that Tyler also &quot;adopted&quot; another 13-year-old girl in a similar fashion.

=== Health ===
In 2006, immediately after a two-hour performance in Florida, Tyler got into an argument during which he yelled. He awoke the next morning to find that he had a hoarse voice. On March 22, 2006, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Tyler would undergo surgery for an &quot;undisclosed medical condition&quot;. A statement from Tyler&#x27;s publicist read in part, &quot;Despite Aerosmith&#x27;s desire to keep the tour going as long as possible, [Tyler&#x27;s] doctors advised him not to continue performing to give his voice time to recover.&quot; Aerosmith&#x27;s remaining North American tour dates in 2006 on the Rockin&#x27; the Joint Tour were subsequently canceled.

The cause was diagnosed as a ruptured blood vessel in his throat, which was successfully sealed off using a laser by Dr. Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation. In the words of Tyler: &quot;He just took a laser and zapped the blood vessel.&quot; After a few weeks of rest, Tyler and the rest of Aerosmith entered the studio on May 20, 2006, to begin work on their new album.

Tyler&#x27;s first public performance after the surgery was July 3–4, 2006, with Joe Perry at the Hatch Shell in Boston, with the Boston Pops Orchestra. The duo sang &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; as part of the Boston Pops July 4 Fireworks Spectacular. Tyler&#x27;s throat surgery was featured in 2007 on an episode of the National Geographic Channel series, &quot;Incredible Human Machine&quot;.

In a September 2006 interview with &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, Tyler revealed that he had been suffering from hepatitis C for the past 11 years. He was diagnosed with the disease in 2003 and had undergone extensive treatment from 2003 to 2006, including 11 months of interferon therapy, which he said was &quot;agony&quot;. The disease is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact, or by sharing used needles.

Tyler has publicly acknowledged his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. In a 2019 interview, Tyler recalled: &quot;There was a moment in &#x27;88 where management and the band pulled an intervention on me. They thought, &#x27;Get the lead singer sober, and all our problems would be over&#x27;...I am grateful and owe a thanks to them for my sobriety&quot;. Tyler added: &quot;I have had many times in my life where I just couldn&#x27;t handle — whether it was a marriage or my addiction had reared its ugly head — and the rest of the guys in the band are not unlike that. But we have all seen each other through it, and we are here today&quot;.

In September 2023, Tyler suffered a vocal injury during a concert from Aerosmith&#x27;s farewell tour. In August 2024, the group was forced to cancel the tour and retire from touring after it was determined that Tyler could not sufficiently recover from the injury.

<doc id="420442" wikidata="Q957248" url="?curid=420442" title="Peril at End House">
<text>Peril at End House is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the US by the Dodd, Mead and Company in February 1932 and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in March of the same year. The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).

The book features Christie&#x27;s private detective Hercule Poirot, as well as Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp, and is the sixth novel featuring Poirot. Poirot and Hastings vacation in Cornwall, meeting young Magdala &quot;Nick&quot; Buckley and her friends. He is persuaded that someone is out to kill her. They meet all of her friends at her home called End House. Though he aims to protect Nick, a murder happens that provokes Poirot to mount a serious investigation.

The novel was well received when first published, with the plot remarked as unusually ingenious and diabolically clever by reviewers. Writing in 1990, Robert Barnard found it cunning, but not one of Christie&#x27;s very best. It has been adapted to stage, radio, film, television, graphic novel, and a computer game, and translated to many other languages as a book.

==Plot summary==
Poirot and Hastings are staying at a Cornish resort. Conversing with Magdala &quot;Nick&quot; Buckley, Poirot believes that someone is out to kill her, confirmed when he finds a bullet that Nick had thought to be a wasp shooting past her head. Poirot explains his concern to Nick. Poirot suspects someone in Nick&#x27;s inner circle. Nick&#x27;s nearest living relative is a lawyer cousin, Charles Vyse, who arranged the re-mortgaging on End House for her to supply desperately needed funds. Her housekeeper is Ellen, and the lodge near End House is leased by Australians Mr and Mrs Croft. George Challenger has a soft spot for Nick. Nick&#x27;s two closest friends are Freddie Rice, an abused wife, and Jim Lazarus, an art dealer in love with Freddie. When Nick had surgery six months earlier, the Crofts suggested she make a will.

It is not clear who wants Nick dead. Charles would inherit End House and Freddie would get the rest of the estate – none of which is worth killing for. At Poirot&#x27;s advice, Nick calls her cousin Maggie to stay with her for a few weeks. When Maggie arrives, Nick hosts a party with everyone present but George. A renowned pilot named Michael Seton has gone missing, sparking debate about his fate. Nick receives a call while the guests are enjoying the party. Maggie is found dead, wearing Nick&#x27;s shawl. Nick and Maggie had gone to freshen up, after which Maggie wore Nick&#x27;s shawl. George is relieved to see Nick alive. Realizing that Maggie was killed by mistake under his nose, Poirot becomes furious, launching an investigation.

To protect Nick, Poirot tells everyone that she is going to a hospital. He asks her not to eat anything from an unknown source. The next day, the newspapers report that Michael Seton is dead and Poirot correctly deduces that Nick received that information through the call. Nick confesses to Poirot that she and Michael were secretly engaged. Michael was the sole heir of vast wealth, and that wealth will go to his fiancée. Poirot is wary of the Crofts: he asks Inspector Japp to inquire about them. Poirot and Hastings find the love letters written by Michael, but do not find Nick&#x27;s original will. Nick recalls sending it to Charles, who denies receiving it. Mr Croft tells Poirot that he sent the will to Charles; one of the men is lying. Nick receives a box of chocolates laced with cocaine, allegedly sent by Poirot. Nick is safe as she ate only one. The chocolates were delivered by Freddie, who claims that Nick phoned her to bring them. Poirot suspects Freddie, who is a cocaine addict.

Poirot sets up a ruse with Nick&#x27;s participation, telling the others that Nick is dead. Charles tells Poirot that he received Nick&#x27;s will, which is read in End House, awarding her money to the Crofts for helping her father in Australia. This startles all except the Crofts. Poirot announces to the stunned guests that a seance will be conducted and Nick&#x27;s &quot;ghost&quot; appears, exposing the Crofts. They replaced her will with a forged one and sent it to Charles after they heard news of her death. Japp reveals that the Crofts are known forgers. He arrests the duo. But Poirot announces that they had no hand in the murder. Just then, someone outside shoots at Freddie and misses, then shoots himself. Poirot captures the man, Freddie&#x27;s sick and dying husband, who wrote many notes begging her for money.

Poirot reveals that the real murderer is Nick. Michael was engaged to Maggie, not Nick: the cousins have the same name, Magdala Buckley. After learning of Michael&#x27;s wealth and disappearance, Nick plotted to present herself as Michael&#x27;s fiancée to usurp his wealth, a plot which required Maggie&#x27;s death. The attempts on her life were her own work. George used to supply cocaine to both Freddie and Nick concealed in wristwatches; Nick used her supply to poison the chocolates. Nick is arrested, taking Freddie&#x27;s wristwatch as a &quot;souvenir&quot;; the full box contains enough for Nick to take an overdose and escape the gallows. Poirot tells George either to surrender himself or go away, allowing Freddie to recover from her addiction. In the end, Jim and Freddie decide to marry, and Jim, who is an art dealer, reveals to Poirot that one of Nick&#x27;s paintings on the wall is actually of considerable value, though Nick herself did not realize it.

==Literary significance and reception==
The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; on 14 April 1932, stated that the &quot;actual solution is quite unusually ingenious, and well up to the standard of Mrs. Christie&#x27;s best stories. Everything is perfectly fair, and it is possible to guess the solution of the puzzle fairly early in the book, though it is certainly not easy.&quot; The review further opined that, &quot;This is certainly one of those detective stories which is pure puzzle, without any ornament or irrelevant interest in character. Poirot and his faithful Captain Hastings are characters whom one is glad to meet again, and they are the most lively in the book, but even they are little more than pawns in this problem. But the plot is arranged with almost mathematical neatness, and that is all that one wants.&quot;

Isaac Anderson began his review in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; on 6 March 1932, by writing &quot;With Agatha Christie as the author and Hercule Poirot as the central figure, one is always assured of an entertaining story with a real mystery to it ... [T]he person who is responsible for the dirty work at End House is diabolically clever, but not quite clever enough to fool the little Belgian detective all the time. A good story with a most surprising finish.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;A cunning use of simple tricks used over and over in Christie&#x27;s career (be careful, for example, about names – diminutives and ambiguous male-female Christian names are always possibilities as readers discover). Some creaking in the machinery, and rather a lot of melodrama and improbabilities, prevent this from being one of the very best of the classic specimens.&quot;

==References to other works==
* Two references (in chapters 1 and 5) are made to the events told in &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot; and it is clearly stated in chapter 1 that &quot;Peril at End House&quot; takes place the August following Poirot&#x27;s trip to the French Riviera described in that book.
* In chapter 9, there is a remark in passing, on the cleverest type of crime, which later became the theme of &quot;Curtain: Poirot&#x27;s Last Case&quot;, which ends with his death.
* At the beginning of chapter 14, Hastings describes how Poirot&#x27;s obsession for tidiness helped him solve a case when he straightened ornaments on a mantelpiece. This is an indirect reference to &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;.
* In chapter 15, Poirot mentions the case &quot;The Chocolate Box&quot; included in the book &quot;Poirot&#x27;s Early Cases&quot;, when he tells Commander Challenger that he indeed had failures in the past.
* In chapter 16, Inspector Japp asks Poirot if he had not retired to grow marrows. This is an indirect reference to the failed attempt at retirement depicted in &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, when Poirot settled in the small village of King&#x27;s Abbot, only to be prompted to investigate a murder in the village.

==Allusions to actual history, geography and current science==
*Transposed from Devon to Cornwall, the Majestic Hotel of the book is based on the Imperial Hotel in Torquay.
*In chapter seven, reference is made by the characters to a female aviator who went to Australia. This is an allusion to Amy Johnson who made the first solo flight from England to Australia by a woman from 5 May 1930 to 24 May 1930.
*The attempt by Michael Seton to fly solo around the world is a key element in the novel, which was released in 1932. At the time, the feat had never been achieved; in 1933, Wiley Post became the first aviator to circumnavigate the globe.

The first true publication of the book was the US serialisation in the weekly &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine in eleven instalments from 13 June (Volume 8, Number 24) to 22 August 1931, (Volume 8, Number 34). There were slight abridgements to the text, no chapter divisions, and the reference in Chapter III to the character of Jim Lazarus as, &quot;a Jew, of course, but a frightfully decent one&quot; was deleted. The serialisation carried illustrations by W.D. Stevens. In the UK, the novel was serialised in the weekly &quot;Women&#x27;s Pictorial&quot; magazine in eleven instalments from 10 October (Volume 22, Number 561) to 19 December 1931, (Volume 22, Number 571) under the slightly different title of &quot;The Peril at End House&quot;. There were slight abridgements and no chapter divisions. All of the instalments carried illustrations by Fred W. Purvis.

===Book dedication===
The dedication of the book reads:
To Eden Phillpotts. To whom I shall always be grateful for his friendship and the encouragement he gave me many years ago.

In 1908, Christie was recovering from influenza and bored, and she started to write a story at the suggestion of her mother, Clara Miller (see the dedication to &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;). This suggestion sparked Christie&#x27;s interest in writing and several pieces were composed, some of which are now lost or remain unpublished (one exception to this is &quot;The Call of Wings&quot; which later appeared in &quot;The Hound of Death&quot; in 1933). These early efforts were mostly short stories, but at some point late in the year Christie attempted her first novel, &quot;Snow Upon the Desert&quot;. She sent it to several publishers but they all rejected the work. At Clara&#x27;s suggestion she then asked Phillpotts to read and critique both the book and other examples of her writing. He was a neighbour and friend of the Miller family in Torquay. He sent an undated reply back which included the praise that, &quot;some of your work is capital. You have a great feeling for dialogue&quot;. In view of her later success in allowing readers to judge characters&#x27; feelings and motivations for themselves (and in doing so, thereby deceiving themselves as to the identity of the culprits), Phillpotts offered valuable suggestions to, &quot;leave your characters alone, so that they can speak for themselves, instead of always rushing in to tell them what they ought to say, or to explain to the reader what they mean by what they are saying&quot;. He gave her further advice in the letter regarding a number of suggestions for further reading to help improve her work.

Phillpotts gave Christie an introduction to his own literary agents, Hughes Massie, who rejected her work (although in the early 1920s, they did start to represent her). Undaunted, Christie attempted another story, now lost, called &quot;Being So Very Wilful&quot;, and again asked Phillpotts for his views. He replied on 9 February 1909 with a great deal more advice and tips for reading. In her autobiography, published posthumously in 1977, Christie wrote, &quot;I can hardly express the gratitude I feel to him. He could so easily have uttered a few careless words of well-justified criticism and possibly discouraged me for life. As it was, he set out to help&quot;.

===Dustjacket blurb===
The blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the UK first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads:Three near escapes from death in three days! Is it accident or design? And then a fourth mysterious incident happens, leaving no doubt that some sinister hand is striking at Miss Buckley, the charming young owner of the mysterious End House. The fourth attempt, unfortunately for the would-be murderer, is made in the garden of a Cornish Riviera hotel where Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective, is staying. Poirot immediately investigates the case and relentlessly unravels a murder mystery that must rank as one of the most brilliant that Agatha Christie has yet written. 

==Adaptations==

===Stage===
The story was adapted into a play by Arnold Ridley in 1940 and opened in the West End of London at the Vaudeville Theatre on 1 May. Poirot was played by Francis L. Sullivan.

===Television and film===
A Soviet film version, entitled &quot;Zagadka Endkhauza&quot;, was made in 1989 by Vadim Derbenyov, with Anatoly Ravikovich as Poirot.

The novel was adapted for television in 1990, as part of the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; second series; it was the first full-length novel to be adapted. Poirot was portrayed by David Suchet and Nick Buckley by Polly Walker. Overall, the film was faithful to the novel; however, Freddie&#x27;s husband does not appear in the film nor does he shoot at Nick during the denouement, Challenger is arrested rather than being allowed to flee, and the fates of Freddie and Jim remain unresolved.
Colonel Weston had been omitted from the adaptation and Miss Lemon added. This episode was filmed in Salcombe, Devon near Agatha Christie&#x27;s home town of Torquay, rather than on the Cornish Coast where the story is set. 
The novel was adapted as an episode of the Japanese animated series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Great Detectives Poirot and Marple&quot;, under the title &quot;The Mystery of End House&quot;. It aired in 2004.

The novel was again adapted as the fourth episode of the first season of the French television series &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot;, airing in 2009.

===Radio===
&quot;Peril at End House&quot; was adapted for radio by Michael Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 featuring John Moffatt as Poirot and Simon Williams as Captain Hastings.

===Computer game===
On 22 November 2007, &quot;Peril at End House&quot;, like &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, was adapted into a PC game by Floodlight Games, and published as a joint venture between Oberon Games and Big Fish Games, with the player once again taking the role of Poirot as he searches End House and other areas in Cornwall Coast for clues, and questions suspects based on information he finds, this time through the clue cards he gains on the way. Two other titles developed by Floodlight Games were later released based on Christie&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; and &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot; respectively.

===Graphic novel===
&quot;Peril at End House&quot; was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation in 2008, adapted by Thierry Jollet and illustrated by Didier Quella-Guyot ().

<doc id="420449" wikidata="Q5622332" url="?curid=420449" title="Guy Hever">
<text>Guy Hever (; born 30 May 1977) is an Israeli MIA. Hever, a soldier in the Israeli Army, has been missing since 17 August 1997. He was last seen on his army base at 9:30 AM on the Golan Heights, dressed in his army fatigues, carrying his weapon, a Galil AR, his military disk and his international military identification papers (Geneva Convention Card). The area was searched thoroughly, but to this day his whereabouts are unknown.

==Biography==
Guy Hever was born in Nahariya, Israel to Rina and Eitan Hever.

==Disappearance==
Hever had previously been sentenced to 21 days confinement for falling asleep during guard duty. On Saturday night, Hever was tasked with placing stickers on crates of supplies, an order he refused to carry out, and accordingly received a court martial summoning for insubordination. On Sunday morning, he finished his guard duty at 9:15 AM and was last seen at 9:30 AM buying a can of Coca-Cola, still in his uniform and with rifle in hand, then leaving the base without permission. He was never seen again after this.

The original IDF investigation surmised that he had gone AWOL and had subsequently committed suicide, citing his upcoming courtmartial and a history of previous clashes with commanding officers. Both the military and the police searched for him, including with divers, dogs, robots and aircraft, but no trace of his body or weapon was ever found. They refused to classify Hever as a missing soldier for three years. His mother however was convinced from the beginning that her son was kidnapped by Syrian forces, although the Syrian government consistently ignored overtures from former US president Jimmy Carter, former Israeli and Syrian US ambassador Edward Djerejian and agents from the German Federal Intelligence Service.

On the day of his disappearance, a birdwatcher reported seeing a figure in military fatigues on the border, although this report is considered unreliable. Several months later, a woman living near the army base said that she saw someone matching his description walking towards the Syrian border, and a German woman wrote to Hever&#x27;s mother in 2005 claiming to have seen Hever being interrogated in Damascus. She had previously alerted the IDF of this, but had been ignored.

On 13 February 2007, a Syrian organization calling itself &quot;The Resistance Committees for the Release of the Golan Heights&quot; claimed to be holding Hever. The credibility of the statement is in doubt, since it came ten years after Hever&#x27;s disappearance. Army officials said at the time that the IDF was investigating the claim, although it stated that this was not the first time that an organization claimed to have Hever in captivity.

In July 2009, Rina Hever said that she met with Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The premier pledged that a special point-man would be named to oversee the activity undertaken by the various defense agencies in the state in finding her missing son.

In August 2009, Rina Hever also met with Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry director general Yossi Gal. The mother, who in the past sought the ministry&#x27;s aid in finding her son yet was only accorded limited cooperation, requested that the government seriously broach the matter with the Syrians via an intermediary.

In the end of July 2009, Israel launched a quiet diplomatic campaign in an attempt to ascertain the whereabouts of Hever. Israel passed a message along to Syria via Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in which Jerusalem communicated its desire to obtain any information that Syria may possess on Hever. While it is not clear if the soldier is in Syria, the move represents a significant change in Israel&#x27;s official policy in the case. The goal of the campaign is to determine whether Syria can provide information on Hever&#x27;s fate.

In 2011, the IDF appointed a high-ranking officer to liaise between Hever&#x27;s family and the security services.

In 2014, the IDF resumed the search for Hever, torching two minefields near the base in order to see if any of the explosions were unusual, although no discovery was made.

In 2015, the IDF searched reservoirs in case Hever had drowned, but again to no avail.

In 2016, the IDF made another search, this time on land, but found no trace of Hever. The army also followed up on a lead from a psychic medium, and found human remains and clothes of a different individual in the Golan.

In 2017, the IDF raided a home for the mentally ill in the southern city of Rahat following a report than Hever was being kept there, but subsequently determined he was not there.

==Interest in the case==
The Hever case has received significantly more attention that other missing person cases, including missing soldiers, and his name is often incorporated into the mission statements of NGOs focused on missing soldiers. According to anthropologist Dr. Danny Kaplan this is due to a number of factors: his role as a combat soldier, the social status of his family, and officials entertaining the possibility of Hever crossing over to Syria that has made it easier to add Hever to the more &quot;valued&quot; group of soldiers that are missing behind enemy lines.

<doc id="420454" wikidata="Q966332" url="?curid=420454" title="Ralph Hall">
<text>Ralph Moody Hall (May 3, 1923 – March 7, 2019) was an American politician who served as the United States representative for from 1981 to 2015. He was first elected in 1980, and was the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology from 2011 to 2013. He was also a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. In 2004, he switched to the Republican Party after having been a member of the Democratic Party for more than 50 years.

At 91, he was the oldest serving member of Congress at the end of his last term in office, the oldest person to ever serve in the House of Representatives, the oldest one ever elected to a House term, the oldest House member ever to cast a vote, and also the last member of Congress from the G.I. Generation. Michigan Congressman John Dingell and he were the last two World War II veterans serving in Congress.

On March 6, 2014, Hall was challenged in the Republican primary by five other Republicans. He received 45.42% of the vote, which was under 50%, the amount required to avoid a runoff election. In the runoff, Hall faced former U.S. Attorney John Ratcliffe, who finished second in the primary with 28.77% of the vote. On May 27, 2014, Ratcliffe defeated Hall in the runoff election, 53 to 47%.

==Early life, education, and law career==
Hall was born in Fate, Texas, and was a lifelong resident of Rockwall County, northeast of Dallas. He graduated from Rockwall High School in 1941. He joined the U.S. Navy on December 10, 1942, serving as an aircraft carrier pilot from 1942 to 1945 during World War II, attaining the rank of lieutenant.

When he was young, Hall pumped gas for a man and woman whom he later identified as the infamous gangsters Bonnie and Clyde.

He attended Texas Christian University in Fort Worth during 1943. After the war, he attended the University of Texas (1946–1947), and received a law degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1951. He was admitted to the Texas Bar in 1951 and maintained a private law practice in Rockwall for many years.

==Early political career (1950–1973)==
Hall was elected county judge of Rockwall County, Texas, in November 1950. He held that position until 1962.

In 1962, he was elected to the Texas State Senate after incumbent Ray Roberts won a special election to replace Sam Rayburn in Congress. As a state senator, he chaired a variety of committees:
* Consumer Protection (1969–1972)
* County, District, and Urban Affairs (1969–1972)
* Historical and Recreational Sites (1969–1970)
* Motion Picture Theater Industry (1969–1970)
* Counties, Cities, and Towns (1967–1968)
* Local and Uncontested Bills (1967–1968)
* Transportation (1965–1966)

In 1972, he ran for lieutenant governor of Texas and lost the Democratic primary, getting only 15% of the vote. Bill Hobby won the primary with a plurality of 33%, and won the general election.

==Business (1973–1980)==

He was the president and CEO of Texas Aluminum Corp. and general counsel of Texas Extrusion Co., Inc. He was founding member and chairman of Lakeside National Bank of Rockwall, and was chairman of the directors of Lakeside News, Inc. He was a counsel for the aircraft parts maker Howmet Corporation from 1970 to 1974.

As of 2006, he was serving as the chairman, president, or director of Crowley Holding Co., Bank of Crowley, Lakeside National Bank, Lakeside Bancshares Inc., North &amp; East Trading Co., and Linrock Inc.

==Later political career (1980–2015)==
===Elections===
In 1980, incumbent Democratic U.S. congressman Ray Roberts of Texas&#x27;s 4th congressional district decided to retire. Hall won the Democratic primary with 57% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican business manager John Wright, with 52% of the vote, the closest race in the district&#x27;s history and the lowest winning percentage in a general election in Hall&#x27;s political career. He was the fourth person to represent the 4th District since its creation in 1903. The district&#x27;s second congressman, Rayburn, the longtime Speaker of the House, represented the district for 48 years. He has never won re-election in a general election with less than 58% of the vote.

;2004

In November 2004, Hall ran for his first full term as a Republican. He got heavy White House backing, from then-President George W. Bush in the three-way GOP primary that year, defeating two opponents. Hall won the primary with 78% of the vote, and the general election with 67% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate Jim Nickerson and Libertarian Kevin D. Anderson.

;2006

Hall defeated Democratic candidate Glenn Melancon and Libertarian candidate Kurt Helm in the 2006 general election with 67% of the vote.

;2008

In the general election, Hall again faced Democratic nominee Glenn Melancon and was re-elected with 69% of the vote.

;2010

In the Republican primary, Hall won the nomination with 57% of the vote, his worst performance in a primary election since his first election in 1980. It was a six-candidate race, with his closest opponent, Steve Clark, winning 30% of the vote. In the general election, he won re-election with 73% of the vote against Democratic candidate VaLinda Hathcox and two other candidates.

;2012

Hall won the Republican primary with 58% of the vote. He won over Democratic candidate VaLinda Hathcox in the general election for the second race in a row, this time by 73 to 24%.

;2014

In May 2013, Hall announced his bid for an 18th term in the U.S. House. On December 20, 2013, he said that the 2014 campaign would be his last, regardless of the result.

In the March 4, 2014 Republican primary, Hall led a six-candidate field with 29,815 votes (45.4%). Because he did not obtain a majority of the ballots cast, Hall was forced to enter the May 27, 2014 runoff election with the runner-up, former U.S. Attorney John Lee Ratcliffe of Heath, who received 18,891 votes (28.8%).

Ratcliffe defeated Hall in a contentious and expensive March 21 runoff. With the loss, Hall became the only sitting Republican U.S. representative from Texas to unsuccessfully seek renomination to his or her seat out of 257 attempts since statehood. No Democrat even filed, meaning that the runoff was the real contest for the seat. Accordingly, Ratcliffe was elected unopposed, and assumed office on January 3, 2015.

===Tenure===
Hall described himself as &quot;an old-time conservative Democrat.&quot; For many years, he was one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. He was an early supporter of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and also favored legislation requiring a super majority on any tax increases. He frequently opposed the Clinton Administration, and voted for three of the four articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton. He endorsed George W. Bush for President in 2000, becoming one of the few Democratic politicians to do so. The two had been friends for many years.

While Hall was very conservative even by Texas Democratic standards, his conservatism can be attributed to the demographics of the 4th District. It had once been reliably Democratic, but became increasingly friendly to Republicans as Dallas&#x27; suburban growth spilled into the western portion of the district; indeed, the district included a small portion of Dallas itself. The 4th has not supported the Democratic nominee for president since 1964. Despite this district&#x27;s increasingly Republican tilt, Hall won 10 more terms as a Democrat with an average of 60% of the vote. In 1994, for instance, he was re-elected by a 19-point margin, even as other conservative Democratic congressmen lost their seats. By the turn of the century, he was the only elected Democratic official above the county level in what had become one of the most conservative districts in Texas.

Like many in the Democratic Party, he voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1999, he was one of six Democratic congressmen who supported a Republican tax cut plan. He has been an original co-sponsor of bills to repeal the estate tax and the marriage tax.

In late 2002, he voted for the resolution allowing the use of force in Iraq. In March 2003, he voted for a budget that included Bush&#x27;s 10-year, $726 billion tax cut plan. The plan passed the House 215–212.

;2004 party switch
Hall was frequently urged to switch parties, especially after the Republicans took control of the House in 1995. Even as Democrats with far less conservative voting records than Hall&#x27;s, such as Greg Laughlin, Jimmy Hayes, Billy Tauzin, and Nathan Deal, all switched parties, he insisted that he would remain a Democrat as long as it did not hurt his constituents. He said that he had an obligation to &quot;pull my party back toward the middle.&quot; He was one of the co-founders of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate and conservative Democratic congressmen.

In 2003, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay engineered a controversial mid-decade redistricting. Hall was the only White Democratic congressman not targeted by the remap, but his district was shifted slightly to the north. Tyler, the heart of the 4th for a century, was shifted to the neighboring 1st District. It did, however, pick up a portion of Collin County, which had been part of the district until the 1980s round of redistricting.

In January 2004, on the final day for candidates to file to get their names on the ballot for the March 9, 2004, primary, Hall switched parties and became a Republican. He said that Republicans refused to put money for his district into a spending bill, and when he asked why, &quot;the only reason I was given was that I was a Democrat.&quot; He also cited concerns with his Democratic criticism of President Bush; he had not attended Democratic caucus meetings for some time due to the criticism leveled at Bush, his longtime friend. He told the press, &quot;The country is at war. When the country is at war you need to support the president. Some of my fellow congressmen have not been doing that.&quot;

After the switch, which became official on January 5, 2004, the GOP allowed him to keep his seniority. He became chairman of the House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality. He also joined the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans.

;Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)
The Northern Mariana Islands are a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific with a large garment industry. Billing records of Preston Gates Ellis and Rouvelas Meeds, an international law firm employed by the CNMI, the government of the islands, show numerous contacts between the law firm and Hall&#x27;s office. He said his dealings with the law firm were with Lloyd Meeds, a partner with the firm, which at the time listed 36 attorneys on staff, not with Jack Abramoff, the firm&#x27;s representative for the CNMI contract. In 2006, he said of the Northern Marianas, &quot;They were good allies, and I believed their government should handle their affairs and not have us impose labor laws on them.&quot;

In December 1996, Hall and E.K. Slaughter, a friend, and their wives visited the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The trip was arranged by the National Security Caucus Foundation (NSCF), which told him that the trip would be paid for by that group. Greg Hilton, the director of the now-defunct NCSF, had no funding for such trips; he only arranged them with CNMI officials. Hilton said he was led to believe by officials of Preston Gates that the CNMI would pay the expenses and be reimbursed by the private sector. In fact, Preston Gates paid the expenses for such trips and billed the CNMI for reimbursement. For the trip of Hall, Slaughter and their wives, Abramoff billed the CNMI $12,800.

In September 1997, Democratic Representative Neil Abercrombie placed remarks in the Congressional Record describing a teenager described as &quot;Katrina&quot;, whose story had been widely publicized, stating that an &quot;employer had lured her to the CNMI under false pretenses&quot; and that &quot;she was also forced into service as a prostitute.&quot;

Abramoff&#x27;s staff contacted Hall&#x27;s office 15 times in the two months following Abercrombie&#x27;s remarks. In November 1997, he entered into the Congressional Record a statement saying that upon reviewing those remarks, he had &quot;felt that Congressman Abercrombie had relied on an erroneous and misleading article published by the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; some months ago.&quot; The article, according to Hall, said that the teenager &quot;was forced to perform lewd sex acts with customers before a video camera.&quot; He quoted a report by the acting attorney general of the CNMI in response: &quot;in fact...she wanted to do nude dancing...to support her family.&quot; The remarks by Abercrombie did not cite that source, and the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; June 1997 story by Henry Hurt, &quot;Shame on American Soil&quot;, does not refer to a child named Katrina.

In his remarks, he also said, &quot;I intend to seek further information on matters as reported by the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; author—and I would hope that a fair-minded person like Congressman Abercrombie would accompany me early next year if, and when, we can both work a visit into our schedule—a visit that would not involve the expenditure of any American tax dollars.

Asked in 2006 how the 1996 trip benefited the Texas 4th Congressional District he represents, he said, &quot;I think it benefits my constituents if you do anything that benefits the peace through strength people, when you&#x27;re going out to bring information to them to help win the Cold War. That&#x27;s a benefit to them, to their strategic interests.&quot; The last gasps of the Cold War ended in 1991.

He also said &quot;the whole thing was about ... them setting their own minimum wage. They had told me they would waive their foreign aid in return for setting their own minimum wage.&quot; His comments in the Congressional Record in 1997 do not mention a minimum wage and the CNMI receives no foreign aid.

;Views on climate change

On December 1, 2011, Hall gave an interview to &quot;National Journal&quot; in which he expressed disbelief in anthropogenic climate change. He accused climate scientists of concocting the evidence for anthropogenic climate change to receive federal research grants, citing the Climategate controversy and calling investigations which had largely exonerated them &quot;straw-man reviews&quot;. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m really more fearful of freezing. And I don&#x27;t have any science to prove that, but we have a lot of science that tells us they&#x27;re not basing it on real scientific facts.&quot; He responded to allegations that Republicans could be called anti-science in light of these views by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not anti-science, I&#x27;m pro-science, but we ought to have some believable science... We have to be more careful what outlays we make for something that hasn&#x27;t been proved.&quot;

;Legislation sponsored

Hall introduced into the House the North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014 (H.R. 4032; 113th Congress), a bill that would exempt the North Texas Municipal Water District from prosecution under the Lacey Act for transferring water containing invasive species from Oklahoma to Texas. The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders.

In January 2004, regarding his switch of party, Hall said &quot;I talked with some of my family. Some agreed, some did not. My wife didn&#x27;t agree. She&#x27;d rather I quit than switch parties.&quot;

Hall died of natural causes on March 7, 2019, in Rockwall, Texas, at the age of 95.

<text>Thomas Grenville (31 December 1755 – 17 December 1846) was a British politician and bibliophile.

==Background and education==
Grenville was the second son of Prime Minister George Grenville and Elizabeth Wyndham, daughter of Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet. George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham, was his elder brother and William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, his younger brother. He was educated at Eton.

==Career==
In 1778, he was commissioned ensign in the Coldstream Guards and in 1779 promoted a lieutenant in the 80th Regiment of Foot, but resigned his commission in 1780. He was, with one interval, a member of parliament from 1780 to 1810, and for a few months during 1806 and 1807 President of the Board of Control (1806) and then First Lord of the Admiralty (1806–1807). In 1798, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

On 1 February 1799 Grenville and a party were travelling on when she was wrecked near Scharhörn off the Elbe. She was trying to deliver Grenville and his party to Cuxhaven, from where they were to proceed on a diplomatic mission to meet Frederick William III of Prussia in Berlin during the War of the Second Coalition. &quot;Proserpine&quot; was stuck in ice in worsening weather. At 1:30, on 2 February, all 187 persons on &quot;Proserpine&quot; left her and started the six-mile walk to the island Neuwerk, in freezing weather and falling snow. Seven seamen, a boy, four Royal Marines, and one woman and her child died; the rest made it to safety in the tower of Neuwerk. The diplomatic party reached Cuxhaven on 6 February to continue to Berlin via Hamburg and return to London on 23 March.

==Library==

He began collecting books from at least his early twenties, and by his death had amassed 20,240 volumes containing 16,000 titles. The collection is notable for its many editions of Homer, Aesop and Ariosto, for early travel books, and for literature in the Romance languages. Rare volumes include a vellum copy of the Gutenberg Bible, which Grenville bought in France in 1817 for 6,260 francs, a Mainz Psalter and a Shakespeare First Folio. There are also 59 manuscripts. Grenville liked his books to be in excellent condition, and would often have books washed or rebound, as well as seeking out relevant pages to add to any incomplete copies he owned. He lent books widely, Barry Taylor describing his library as apparently &quot;semi-public&quot;. He bequeathed the collection to the British Museum, of which he had become a trustee in 1830, and it is now housed in the King&#x27;s Library Tower in the British Library.

==Personal life==

Grenville died at Piccadilly, London, in December 1846, aged 90. He never married.

<text>The Book of Judith is a deuterocanonical book included in the Septuagint and the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian Old Testament of the Bible but excluded from the Hebrew canon and assigned by Protestants to the apocrypha. It tells of a Jewish widow, Judith, who uses her beauty and charm to kill an Assyrian general who has besieged her city, Bethulia. With this act, she saves nearby Jerusalem from total destruction. The name Judith (), meaning &quot;praised&quot; or &quot;Jewess&quot;, is the feminine form of Judah.

The surviving manuscripts of Greek translations appear to contain several historical anachronisms, which is why some Protestant scholars now consider the book ahistorical. Instead, the book is classified as a parable, theological novel, or even the first historical novel. The Roman Catholic Church has historically maintained the book&#x27;s historicity, assigning its events to the reign of King Manasseh of Judah and that the names were changed in later centuries for an unknown reason. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; identifies Shechem (modern day Nablus) as &quot;Bethulia&quot;, and argues that the name was changed because of the feud between the Jews and Samaritans. If this is the case, it would explain why other names seem anachronistic as well.

==Historical context==
===Original language===
It is not clear whether the Book of Judith was originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek, as the oldest existing version is from the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures. However, due to the large number of Hebraisms in the text, it is generally agreed that the book was written in a Semitic language, probably Hebrew or Aramaic, rather than Koine Greek. When Jerome completed his Latin Vulgate translation, he asserted his belief that the book was written &quot;in Chaldean (Aramaic) words&quot;. Jerome&#x27;s Latin translation was based on an Aramaic manuscript and was shorter because he omitted passages that he could not read or understand in the Aramaic that otherwise existed in the Septuagint. The Aramaic manuscript used by Jerome has long since been lost. 

Carey A. Moore argued that the Greek text of Judith was a translation from a Hebrew original, and used many examples of conjectured translation errors, Hebraic idioms, and Hebraic syntax. The extant Hebrew manuscripts are very late and only date back to the Middle Ages. The two surviving Hebrew manuscripts of Judith are translated from the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. 

The Hebrew versions name important figures directly, such as the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and place the events during the Hellenistic period when the Maccabees battled the Seleucid monarchs. However, because the Hebrew manuscripts mention kingdoms that had not existed for hundreds of years by the time of the Seleucids, it is unlikely that these were the original names in the text. Jeremy Corley argued that Judith was originally composed in Greek that was carefully modeled after Hebrew and pointed out &quot;Septuagintalisms&quot; in the vocabulary and phrasing of the Greek text.

===Canonicity===
====In Judaism====
While the author was likely Jewish, there is no evidence aside from its inclusion in the Septuagint that the Book of Judith was ever considered authoritative or a candidate for canonicity by any Jewish group. The Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible does not contain it; it is not found among the Dead Sea Scrolls or any early Rabbinic literature. Speculated reasons for its exclusion include the possible lateness of its composition, possible Greek origin, apparent support of the Hasmonean dynasty (to which the early rabbinate was opposed), and perhaps the brash and seductive character of Judith herself.

After disappearing from circulation among Jews for over a millennium, however, references to the Book of Judith and the figure of Judith herself resurfaced in the religious literature of crypto-Jews who escaped Christian persecution after the capitulation of the Caliphate of Córdoba. The renewed interest took the form of &quot;tales of the heroine, liturgical poems, commentaries on the Talmud, and passages in Jewish legal codes.&quot; Although the text does not mention Hanukkah, it became customary for a Hebrew midrashic variant of the Judith story to be read on the Shabbat of Hanukkah as the story of Hanukkah takes place during the time of the Hasmonean dynasty.

That midrash, whose heroine is portrayed as gorging the antagonist on cheese and wine before cutting off his head, may have formed the basis of the minor Jewish tradition to eat dairy products during Hanukkah. In that respect, the Jewry of Europe during the Middle Ages appear to have viewed Judith as the Maccabean-Hasmonean counterpart to Queen Esther, the heroine of the holiday of Purim. The textual reliability of the Book of Judith was also taken for granted, to the extent that biblical commentator Nachmanides (Ramban) quoted several passages from a Peshitta (Syriac version) of Judith in support of his rendering of Deuteronomy 21:14.

====In Christianity====
Although early Christians, such as Clement of Rome, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria, read and used the Book of Judith, some of the oldest Christian canons, including the Bryennios List (1st/2nd century), that of Melito of Sardis (2nd century), and Origen (3rd century), do not include it. Jerome, when he produced his Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Vulgate, counted it among the apocrypha, (though he later changed his mind, quoted it as scripture, and said he merely expressed the views of the Jews), as did Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Epiphanius of Salamis.

Many influential fathers and doctors of the Church, including Augustine, Basil of Caesarea, Tertullian, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Bede the Venerable and Hilary of Poitiers, considered the book sacred scripture both before and after councils that formally declared it part of the biblical canon. In a 405 letter, Pope Innocent I declared it part of the Christian canon. In Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Prologue to Judith&quot;, he claims that the Book of Judith was &quot;found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures&quot;. No such declaration has been found in the Canons of Nicaea, and it is uncertain whether Jerome was referring to the book&#x27;s use during the council&#x27;s discussion or spurious canons attributed to that council. Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin speculates that Jerome was correct about the Council of Nicaea establishing a canon and that the documents about this have been lost to time.

Regardless of Judith&#x27;s status at Nicaea, the book was also accepted as scripture by the councils of Rome (382), Hippo (393), Carthage (397), and Florence (1442) and eventually dogmatically defined as canonical by the Roman Catholic Church in 1546 in the Council of Trent. The Eastern Orthodox Church also accepts Judith as inspired scripture; this was confirmed in the Synod of Jerusalem in 1672. The canonicity of Judith is typically rejected by Protestants, who accept as the Old Testament only those books that are found in the Jewish canon. Martin Luther viewed the book as an allegory, but listed it as the first of the eight writings in his Apocrypha, which is located between the Old Testament and New Testament of the Luther Bible. Though Lutheranism views the Book of Judith as non-canonical, it is deemed edifying for matters of morality, as well as devotional use. In Anglicanism, it has the intermediate authority of the Apocrypha of the Old Testament and is regarded as useful or edifying, but is not to be taken as a basis for establishing doctrine.

Judith is also referred to in chapter 28 of 1 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

==Contents==
===Plot summary===
The story revolves around Judith, a daring and beautiful widow, who is upset with her Judean countrymen for not trusting God to deliver them from their foreign conquerors. She goes with her loyal maid to the camp of the Assyrian general, Holofernes, with whom she slowly ingratiates herself, promising him information on the people of Israel. Gaining his trust, she is allowed access to his tent one night as he lies in a drunken stupor. She decapitates him, then takes his head back to her fearful countrymen. The Assyrians, having lost their leader, disperse, and Israel is saved. Though she is courted by many, Judith remains unmarried for the rest of her life.

===Literary structure===
The Book of Judith can be split into two parts or &quot;acts&quot; of approximately equal length. Chapters 1–7 describe the rise of the threat to Israel, led by king Nebuchadnezzar and his general Holofernes, and is concluded as Holofernes&#x27; worldwide campaign has converged at the mountain pass where Judith&#x27;s village, Bethulia, is located. Chapters 8–16 then introduce Judith and depict her heroic actions to save her people. The first part, although at times tedious in its description of the military developments, develops important themes by alternating battles with reflections and rousing action with rest. In contrast, the second half is devoted mainly to Judith&#x27;s strength of character and the beheading scene.

The New Oxford Annotated Apocrypha identifies a clear chiastic pattern in both &quot;acts&quot;, in which the order of events is reversed at a central moment in the narrative (i.e., abcc&#x27;b&#x27;a&#x27;).

Part I (1:1–7:23)

A. Campaign against disobedient nations; the people surrender (1:1–2:13)
:B. Israel is &quot;greatly terrified&quot; (2:14–3:10)
::C. Joakim prepares for war (4:1–15)
:::D. Holofernes talks with Achior (5:1–6.9)
::::E. Achior is expelled by Assyrians (6:10–13)
::::E&#x27;. Achior is received in the village of Bethulia (6:14–15)
:::D&#x27;. Achior talks with the people (6:16–21)
::C&#x27;. Holofernes prepares for war (7:1–3)
:B&#x27;. Israel is &quot;greatly terrified&quot; (7:4–5)
A&#x27;. Campaign against Bethulia; the people want to surrender (7:6–32)

Part II (8:1–16:25)

A. Introduction of Judith (8:1–8)
:B. Judith plans to save Israel (8:9–10:8), including her extended prayer (9:1–14)
::C. Judith and her maid leave Bethulia (10:9–10)
:::D. Judith beheads Holofernes (10:11–13:10a)

::C&#x27;. Judith and her maid return to Bethulia (13.10b–11)
:B&#x27;. Judith plans the destruction of Israel&#x27;s enemy (13:12–16:20)
A&#x27;. Conclusion about Judith (16.1–25)

Similarly, parallels within Part II are noted in comments within the New American Bible Revised Edition: Judith summons a town meeting in Judith 8:10 in advance of her expedition and is acclaimed by such a meeting in Judith 13:12–13; Uzziah blesses Judith in advance in Judith 8:5 and afterwards in Judith 13:18–20.

===Literary genre===
Most contemporary exegetes, such as Biblical scholar Gianfranco Ravasi, generally tend to ascribe Judith to one of several contemporaneous literary genres, reading it as an extended parable in the form of a historical fiction, or a propaganda literary work from the days of the Seleucid oppression.

It has also been called &quot;an example of the ancient Jewish novel in the Greco-Roman period&quot;. Other scholars note that Judith fits within and even incorporates the genre of &quot;salvation traditions&quot; from the Old Testament, particularly the story of Deborah and Jael (Judges 4–5), who seduced and inebriated the Canaanite commander Sisera before hammering a tent-peg into his forehead.

There are also thematic connections to the revenge of Simeon and Levi on Shechem after the rape of Dinah in Genesis 34.

In the Christian West from the patristic period on, Judith was invoked in a wide variety of texts as a multi-faceted allegorical figure. As a &quot;Mulier sancta&quot;, she personified the Church and many virtues – Humility, Justice, Fortitude, Chastity (the opposite of Holofernes&#x27; vices Pride, Tyranny, Decadence, Lust) – and she was, like the other heroic women of the Hebrew scriptural tradition, made into a typological prefiguration of the Virgin Mary. Her gender made her a natural example of the biblical paradox of &quot;strength in weakness&quot;; she is thus paired with David and her beheading of Holofernes paralleled with that of Goliath – both deeds saved the Covenant People from a militarily superior enemy.

===Main characters===
Judith, the protagonist of the book, introduced in chapter 8 as a God-fearing woman, she is the daughter of Merari, a Simeonite, and widow of a certain Manasseh or Manasses, a wealthy farmer. She sends her maid or &quot;waitingwoman&quot; to summon Uzziah so she can challenge his decision to capitulate to the Assyrians if God has not rescued the people of Bethulia within five days, and she uses her charm to become an intimate friend of Holofernes, but beheads him allowing Israel to counter-attack the Assyrians. Judith&#x27;s maid, not named in the story, remains with her throughout the narrative and is given her freedom as the story ends.
Holofernes, the antagonist of the book. He is a dedicated soldier of his king, general-in-chief of his army, whom he wants to see exalted in all lands. He is given the task of destroying the rebels who did not support the king of Nineveh in his resistance against Cheleud and the king of Media, until Israel also becomes a target of his military campaign. Judith&#x27;s courage and charm occasion his death.

Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Nineveh and Assyria. He is so proud that he wants to affirm his strength as a sort of divine power, although Holofernes, his Turtan (commanding general), goes beyond the king&#x27;s orders when he calls on the western nations to &quot;worship only Nebuchadnezzar, and ... invoke him as a god&quot;. Holofernes is ordered to take revenge on those who refused to ally themselves with Nebuchadnezzar.

Achior, an Ammonite leader at Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s court; in chapter 5 he summarises the history of Israel and warns the king of Assyria of the power of their God, the &quot;God of heaven&quot;, but is mocked. He is protected by the people of Bethulia and is Judaized , and circumcised on hearing what Judith has accomplished.

Bagoas, or Vagao (Vulgate), the eunuch who had charge over Holofernes&#x27; personal affairs. His name is Persian for a eunuch. He brought in Judith to recline with Holofernes and was the first one who discovered his beheading.

Uzziah or Oziah, governor of Bethulia; together with Cabri and Carmi, he rules over Judith&#x27;s city. When the city is besieged by the Assyrians and the water supply dries up, he agrees to the people&#x27;s call to surrender if God has not rescued them within five days, a decision challenged as &quot;rash&quot; by Judith.

===Judith&#x27;s prayer===
Chapter 9 constitutes Judith&#x27;s &quot;extended prayer&quot;, &quot;loudly proclaimed&quot; in advance of her actions in the following chapters. This runs to 14 verses in English versions, 19 verses in the Vulgate.

==Historicity of Judith==

Today, it is generally accepted that the Book of Judith&#x27;s historicity is dubious. The fictional nature &quot;is evident from its blending of history and fiction, beginning in the very first verse, and is too prevalent thereafter to be considered as the result of mere historical mistakes.&quot; The names of people are either unknown to history or appear to be anachronistic, and many of the place names are also unknown. The Catholic Church has always considered the book to be a historical document, and it is included with the other historical books in the Old Testament of Catholic Bibles. For this reason, there have been various attempts by both scholars and clergy to understand the characters and events in the Book as either an allegorical representation of actual events, or a historical document that had been altered or translated improperly. The practice of changing names has been observed in documents from the Second Temple period, such as the Damascus Document, which apparently contains references to an uncertain location referred to by the pseudonym of &quot;Damascus&quot;. The writings of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus also frequently differ from the Biblical record regarding the names of the high priests of Israel. Elsewhere in the Bible there are also names of rulers that are unknown to history, such as Darius the Mede from the Book of Daniel, or Ahasuerus from the Book of Esther. The large size of the Assyrian army and the large size of Median walls in the book have also been criticized, but both of these have been attested to elsewhere in the Bible and in secular historical records. The Assyrian army that besieged Jerusalem in 2 Kings 19 was said to have been 185,000 strong, a number several tens of thousands larger than the Assyrian army described in the book of Judith. Also, the Greek historian Herodotus described the walls of Babylon to have been similar in size and extravagance to the walls of Ecbatana in the book of Judith. Herodotus&#x27;s account was corroborated by similar accounts of the scale of the walls of Babylon by the historians Strabo, Ctesias and Cleitarchus. The identity of the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; in the book has been debated for thousands of years and various rulers have been proposed by scholars, including Ashurbanipal, Artaxerxes III, Tigranes the Great, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, Cambyses II, Xerxes and Darius the Great.

===Identification of Nebuchadnezzar with Ashurbanipal===
For hundreds of years, the most generally accepted view within the Catholic Church is that the book of Judith occurs during the reign of Ashurbanipal, a notoriously cruel and brutal Assyrian king whose reign was marked by various military campaigns and invasions. Ashurbanipal ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire from Nineveh in 668 to 627 BC. The Challoner Douay-Rheims Bible states that the events of the book begin in A.M. 3347, or Ante C. 657, which would be during the reign of Ashurbanipal. This would be the twelfth year of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign, which lines up with the book of Judith beginning in the twelfth year of &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;. If the rest of the book occurs in the seventeenth and eighteenth years of Ashurbanipal, the years would be 653 and 652 BC, years that correspond to revolts and military campaigns across Ashurbanipal&#x27;s empire. The traditional Catholic view that the book dates to the reign of Manasseh corresponds to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign, and Ashurbanipal&#x27;s records name Manasseh as one of a number of vassals who assisted his campaign against Egypt. The profanation of the temple described in &quot;Judith&quot; 4:3 might have been that under king Hezekiah (see 2 Chronicles 33:18–19), who reigned between c. 715 and 686 BC. And in that same verse, the return from the dispersion (often assumed to refer to the Babylonian captivity) might refer to the chaos that resulted in people fleeing Jerusalem after Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians. The reinforcement of the cities as described in &quot;Judith&quot; 4:5 matches up with the reinforcement that happened in response to the Assyrians under Manasseh. &quot;Judith&quot; 4:6 claims that the High Priest of Israel was in charge of the country at the time. However, it is generally assumed that the book takes place after Manasseh&#x27;s return from captivity in Assyria and his subsequent repentance. Nicolaus Serarius, Giovanni Menochio and Thomas Worthington speculated that Manasseh was busy fortifying Jerusalem at the time (which also fits with 2 Chronicles 33) and left the matters of the rest of the Israelites to the high priest. Others, such as Houbigant and Haydock, speculate that the events of the book occurred while Manasseh was still captive in Babylon. Whatever the case, it was a typical policy of the time for the Israelites to follow the high priest if the king could not or would not lead. Manasseh is thought by most scholars to have joined a widespread rebellion against Ashurbanipal that was led by his brother, Šamaš-šuma-ukin. Contemporary sources make reference to the many allies of Chaldea (governed by Šamaš-šuma-ukin), including the Kingdom of Judah, which were subjects of Assyria and are mentioned in the Book of Judith as victims of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s Western campaign. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; identified &quot;Judah&quot; as one of the vassal kingdoms in Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s rebel coalition against Ashurbanipal. The Cambridge Ancient History also confirms that &quot;several princes of Palestine&quot; supported Šamaš-šuma-ukin in the revolt against Ashurbanipal, which seemingly confirms Manasseh&#x27;s involvement in the revolt. This would explain the reinforcement of the cities described in this book and why the Israelites and other western kingdoms rejected &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s&quot; order for conscription, because many of the vassal rulers of the west supported Šamaš-šuma-ukin.

It is of further interest that Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s civil war broke out in 652 BC, the eighteenth year of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign. The book of Judith states that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; ravaged the western part of the empire in the eighteenth year of his reign. If the events of this book did occur during Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign, it is possible that Assyrians did not record it because they were preoccupied with Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s revolt, which was not crushed for years to come. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s successful crushing of Šamaš-šuma-ukin&#x27;s civil war also prevented the Assyrians from retaking Egypt, which gained independence from Assyria around 655 BC. Numerous theologians, including Antoine Augustin Calmet, suspect that the ultimate goal of the western campaign was for the Assyrians to sack Egypt, because Holofernes appeared to be heading directly towards Egypt on his campaign through the west. If Calmet and others are correct in suspecting that Holofernes was intending to sack Egypt, this would give further evidence to the theory that the book is set during the reign of Ashurbanipal, who had previously sacked Thebes in 663 BC. The view that the book of Judith was written during the reigns of Manasseh and Ashurbanipal was held by a great number of Catholic scholars, including Calmet, George Leo Haydock, Thomas Worthington, Richard Challoner, Giovanni Stefano Menochio, Sixtus of Siena, Robert Bellarmine, Charles François Houbigant, Nicolaus Serarius, Pierre Daniel Huet and Bernard de Montfaucon. Many of these theologians are cited and quoted by Calmet in his own commentary on Judith, the &quot;Commentaire littéral sur tous les livres de l&#x27;ancien et du nouveau testament&quot;. Calmet listed all of &quot;the main objections that can be made against the truth of Judith&#x27;s Story&quot; and spent the rest of his commentary on the book addressing them, stating: &quot;But all this did not bother Catholic writers. There were a large number of them who answered it expertly, and who undertook to show that there is nothing incompatible in this history, neither with Scripture, nor even with profane (secular) history&quot;. There were other Catholic writers who held this view as well, such as Fulcran Vigouroux, who went even farther, identifying the battle between &quot;Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians&quot; and &quot;Arphaxad, the king of the Medes&quot; as the battle that occurred between Ashurbanipal and Phraortes. This battle occurred during the seventeenth year of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign, and the book of Judith states that this battle occurred in the seventeenth year of &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s&quot; reign. Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet expressed a similar view regarding this. The scholars used specific examples from the text that line up with Manasseh&#x27;s reign. As argued by Vigouroux, the two battles mentioned in the Septuagint version of the Book of Judith are a reference to the clash of the two empires in 658–657 and to Phraortes&#x27; death in battle in 653, after which Ashurbanipal continued his military actions with a large campaign starting with the Battle of the Ulai River (653 BC) in the eighteenth year of his reign. The King of the &quot;Elymeans&quot; (Elamites), called &quot;Arioch&quot;, is referenced in &quot;Judith&quot; 1:6. If the twelfth year of &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; is to be identified as the twelfth year of Ashurbanipal, this Arioch would be identified as Teumman, who rebelled against Ashurbanipal on many occasions, eventually being killed at the Battle of the Ulai in 653 BC, around the time Catholic theologians place &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s&quot; western campaign.

The identification of &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; with Ashurbanipal was so widespread that it was the only identification in English Catholic Bibles for several hundred years. The 1738 Challoner revision of the Douay Rheims Bible and the Haydock Biblical Commentary specifically declare that &quot;Nabuchodonosor&quot; was &quot;known as &#x27;Saosduchin&#x27; to profane historians and succeeded &#x27;Asarhaddan&#x27; in the kingdom of the Assyrians&quot;. This could only have been Ashurbanipal, as he was the successor of Esarhaddon, his father. It is unclear where the name &quot;Saosduchin&quot; came from, although it is possible that it was derived from the Canon of Kings by the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy, who wrote in Greek that &quot;Saosdouchinos&quot; followed &quot;Asaradinos&quot; as the king of Assyria. While influential, Ptolemy&#x27;s record is not perfect, and Ptolemy likely got Ashurbanipal confused with his brother, Šamaš-šuma-ukin, who ruled over Babylon, not Assyria. This would be a plausible explanation for the origin of the Greek name &quot;Saosduchin&quot;. However, while Nebuchadnezzar and Ashurbanipal&#x27;s campaigns show clear and direct parallels, the main incident of Judith&#x27;s intervention has not been found in any record aside from this book. An additional difficulty with this theory is that the reasons for the name changes are difficult to understand, unless the text was transmitted without character names before they were by a later copyist or translator, who lived centuries later. Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin argues the possibility that the book of Judith is a roman à clef, a historical record with different names for people and places. Ashurbanipal is never referenced by name in the Bible, except perhaps for the corrupt form &quot;Asenappar&quot; in 2 Chronicles and Ezra 4:10 or the anonymous title &quot;The King of Assyria&quot; in 2 Chronicles (33:11), which means his name might have never been recorded by Jewish historians, which could explain the lack of his name in the book of Judith.

===Identification of Nebuchadnezzar with Artaxerxes III Ochus===
The identity of Nebuchadnezzar was unknown to the Church Fathers, but some of them attempted an improbable identification with Artaxerxes III Ochus (359–338 BC), not on the basis of the character of the two rulers, but due to the presence of a &quot;Holofernes&quot; and a &quot;Bagoas&quot; in Ochus&#x27; army. This view also gained currency with scholarship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, due to discrepancies between Artaxerxes&#x27;s reign and the events in the book of Judith, this theory has largely been abandoned.

===Identification of Nebuchadnezzar with Tigranes the Great===
Modern scholars argue in favor of a 2nd–1st century context for the Book of Judith, understanding it as a sort of roman à clef, i.e. a literary fiction whose characters stand for some real historical figure, generally contemporary to the author. In the case of the Book of Judith, Biblical scholar Gabriele Boccaccini, identified Nebuchadnezzar with Tigranes the Great (140–56 BC), a powerful King of Armenia who, according to Josephus and Strabo, conquered all of the lands identified by the Biblical author in Judith. Under this theory, the story, although fictional, would be set in the time of Queen Salome Alexandra, the only Jewish regnant queen, who reigned over Judea from 76 to 67 BC.

Like Judith, the Queen had to face the menace of a foreign king who had a tendency to destroy the temples of other religions. Both women were widows whose strategical and diplomatic skills helped in the defeat of the invader. Both stories seem to be set at a time when the temple had recently been rededicated, which is the case after Judas Maccabee killed Nicanor and defeated the Seleucids. The territory of Judean occupation includes the territory of Samaria, something which was possible in Maccabean times only after John Hyrcanus reconquered those territories. Thus, the presumed Sadducee author of Judith would desire to honor the great (Pharisee) Queen who tried to keep both Sadducees and Pharisees united against the common menace.

===Location of Bethulia===
Although there is no historically recorded &quot;Bethulia&quot;, the book of Judith gives an extremely precise location for where the city is located, and there are several possible candidates of ancient towns in that area that are now ruins. It has widely been speculated that, based on location descriptions in the book, that the most plausible historical site for Bethulia is Shechem. Shechem is a large city in the hill-country of Samaria, on the direct road from Jezreel to Jerusalem, lying in the path of the enemy, at the head of an important pass and is a few hours south of Geba. The Jewish Encyclopedia subscribes to the theory, suggesting that it was called by a pseudonym because of the historical animosity between the Jews and Samaritans. The Jewish Encyclopedia claims that Shechem is the only location that meets all the requirements for Bethulia&#x27;s location, further stating: &quot;The identity of Bethulia with Shechem is thus beyond all question&quot;. Charles Cutler Torrey pointed out that the description of water being brought to the city by means of an aqueduct from a spring above the city on the south side is a trait that can only belong to Shechem.

The Catholic Encyclopedia writes: &quot;The city was situated on a mountain overlooking the plain of Jezrael, or Esdrelon, and commanding narrow passes to the south (); at the foot of the mountain there was an important spring, and other springs were in the neighborhood (). Moreover, it lay within investing lines which ran through Dothain, or Dothan, now Tell Dothân, to Belthem, or Belma, no doubt the same as the Belamon of , and thence to Kyamon, or Chelmon, &quot;which lies over against Esdrelon&quot; (). These data point to a site on the heights west of Jenin (Engannim), between the plains of Esdrelon and Dothan, where Haraiq el-Mallah, Khirbet Sheikh Shibel and el-Bârid lie close together. Such a site best fulfills all requirements for the location of Bethulia.

The Madaba Map mosaic from the 6th century AD, shows a settlement named &quot;Betylion&quot; (Greek Β[ΗΤ]ΥΛΙΟΝ). Many believe this to be Bethulia, but this is unlikely because it is located much farther south. It instead is located on the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip, in modern-day Sheikh Zuweid.

==Place names specific to the Book of Judith==
Whilst a number of the places referred to are familiar biblical or modern place names, there are others which are considered fictional or whose location is not otherwise known. Theologians Antoine Augustin Calmet, Wilhelm Gesenius and Franz Karl Movers all worked to explain bizarre geographical locations in the book as copyist or translation mistakes. For instance, Movers explained χαλλαίων (&quot;challaion&quot;) as referring to χαλδαίων, or &quot;Chaldean&quot;. A few more of these disputed locations include:
* 1:5 – the territory of Ragae, possible Rages or Rhages, cf. Tobit 1:16
* 1:6 – the rivers Euphrates and Tigris are mentioned, as well as the Hydaspes (Jadason in the Vulgate). Hydaspes is also the Greek name for the Jhelum River in modern India and Pakistan. However, Calmet identified this river as the Karkheh River, called the &quot;Choaspes&quot; by the Greeks. Calmet claims that the copyists confused the Choaspes with the Hydaspes, and claims that the historian Quintus Curtius Rufus made this exact mistake.
* 2:21 – the plain of Bectileth, three days&#x27; march from Nineveh. Calmet identified this as the &quot;Bagadania plain&quot; in Cappadocia that was described by Strabo as being &quot;at the foot of the Taurus Mountains&quot;
* 4:4 – Kona. Both Calmet and the Bibles of Complute believe that it simply refers to “villages”. Mark 8:27 says that they came to “the villages (κώμας, kômas) of Caesarea Philippi.” It is possible that among those villages were the Old Testament sites of Baal-gad and Baal-Hermon. This is also how Johannes Van Der Ploeg translated the passage from the Syriac Trivandrum manuscript.
* 4:4 – Belmain. The Syriac Peshitta writes the name of this location as Abel-meholah (as well as in 7:3), and this identification was further supported by Calmet. Some have speculated that, because the two verses spell the name differently, that it is a different location, possibly Belameh.
* 4:4 – Choba. Possibly the Hobah mentioned in Genesis 14:15. If it is to be identified with Muqeible, which was referred to as &quot;Muqeibleh&quot; in antiquity, a possible etymology for &quot;Choba&quot;.
* 4:4 – Aesora. The Septuagint calls it &quot;Aisora&quot;, &quot;Arasousia&quot;, &quot;Aisoraa&quot;, or &quot;Assaron&quot;, depending on the manuscript. Possibly Tel Hazor or En-hazor, both of which are mentioned in the book of Joshua.
* 4:4 – The valley of Salem. It could be identified with &quot;Shalem, a city of Shechem&quot; mentioned in Genesis 33:18. This is the modern city of Salim, located about three miles east of Shechem, and is located at the foot of the Jordan Valley.
* 4:6 and several later references – Bethulia, a gated city (Judith 10:6). From the gates of the city, the valley below can be observed (Judith 10:10). Because of the geography described, it is theorized by many, including the Jewish Encyclopedia and Charles Cutler Torrey, to be a pseudonym for Shechem. This would explain why the city&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Beth El&quot;, or &quot;House of God&quot;: the Samaritans built their own schismatic Temple on Mount Gerizim. 
* 4:6 – Betomesthaim or Betomasthem. Some translations refer to &quot;the people of Bethulia and Betomesthaim&quot; as a unit, which &quot;faces (&quot;singular&quot;) Esdraelon opposite the plain near Dothan. The Encyclopædia Britannica refers to the &quot;Plain of Esdraelon&quot; as the plain between the Galilee hills and Samaria. As such, historian and archaeologist Charles Cutler Torrey identified Betomesthaim as a pseudonym for the city of Samaria. Torrey went further to identify the Hebrew basis for Betomesthaim as “Bayit Mizpah”, which means “house of outlook”. This is plausible, because &quot;Samaria&quot; is the Greek translation of the Hebrew name &quot;Shomron&quot;, which means &quot;watch&quot; or &quot;watchman&quot;.
* 4:6 – A plain near Dothan (Dothian in the Vulgate)
* 7:3 - Belbaim. The Syriac Peshitta writes the name of this location as Abel-meholah (as well as in 4:4), and this identification was further supported by Calmet.
* 7:3 – Cyalon or Cynamon, also facing Esdraelon. The &quot;Encyclopedia of the Bible&quot; notes that &quot;some scholars have felt that this name is a corruption for Jokneam&quot;.
* 7:18 – Egrebeh, which is near Chubi, beside the Wadi Mochmur. Both Calmet and Charles William Meredith van de Velde identified Egrebeh with Akrabeh, a ruined site in the mountains of Central Palestine, eleven miles southeast of Shechem. Chubi has been identified with Quzah, a village located near Einabus, five and-a-half miles south of Shechem and five miles west of Agrabeh. The Wady Makfuriyeh is located on the northern slopes of which Akrabeh stands. The Wadi Mochmur as the Wady Makfuriyeh. This identification is supported by the Syriac, which translated the name of the river as &quot;Nachol de-Peor&quot;.
* 8:4 – Balamon. The Septuagint states that Manasseh, Judith&#x27;s husband, was buried in a field between Dothan and Balamon. This detail is not included in the Vulgate. Calmet speculated that &quot;Balamon&quot; was &quot;the same city that they have already named several times, sometimes Belmaïm, and sometimes Belma, or Bélem, or Baalmeon&quot;. It is possible that &quot;Balamon&quot; is a different location that is to be identified with Baal-meon.
* 15:4 – Along with Betomesthaim, other places presumably in the vicinity of Bethulia are mentioned: Choba (or Chobai) and Kola. Choba is generally thought to be the &quot;Choba&quot; from 4:4, if that is the case it could be Muqeible. Kola could be identified with Golan, or possibly Cabul. In this verse, the Codex Alexandrinus also lists a place called Bebai, however this is not included in the Codex Vaticanus. Bebai could be identified with Hebron or Abel-Maim, an identification supported by the Syriac Trivandrum manuscript.

==Later artistic renditions==
The character of Judith is larger than life, and she has won a place in Jewish and Christian lore, art, poetry and drama. The etymology of her name meaning &quot;woman of Judea&quot;, suggests that she represents the heroic spirit of the Jewish people, and that same spirit, as well as her chastity, have endeared her to Christianity.

Owing to her unwavering religious devotion, she is able to step outside of her widow&#x27;s role, and dress and act in a sexually provocative manner while clearly remaining true to her ideals in the reader&#x27;s mind, and her seduction and beheading of the wicked Holofernes while playing this role has been rich fodder for artists of various genres.

===In literature===
The first extant commentary on The Book of Judith is by Hrabanus Maurus (9th century). Thenceforth her presence in Medieval literature is robust: in homilies, biblical paraphrases, histories and poetry. An Old English poetic version is found together with Beowulf (their epics appear both in the Nowell Codex). &quot;The opening of the poem is lost (scholars estimate that 100 lines were lost) but the remainder of the poem, as can be seen, the poet reshaped the biblical source and set the poem&#x27;s narrative to an Anglo–Saxon audience.&quot;

At the same time she is the subject of a homily by the Anglo-Saxon abbot Ælfric. The two conceptual poles represented by these works will inform much of Judith&#x27;s subsequent history.

In the epic, she is the brave warrior, forceful and active; in the homily she is an exemplar of pious chastity for cloistered nuns. In both cases, her narrative gained relevance from the Norse Viking invasions of the period. Within the next three centuries Judith would be treated by such major figures as Heinrich Frauenlob, Dante, and Geoffrey Chaucer.

In medieval Christian art, the predominance of church patronage assured that Judith&#x27;s patristic valences as &quot;Mulier Sancta&quot; and Virgin Mary prototype would prevail: from the 8th-century frescoes in Santa Maria Antigua in Rome through innumerable later bible miniatures. Gothic cathedrals often featured Judith, most impressively in the series of 40 stained glass panels at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris (1240s).

In Renaissance literature and visual arts, all of these trends were continued, often in updated forms, and developed. The already well established notion of Judith as an &quot;exemplum&quot; of the courage of local people against tyrannical rule from afar was given new urgency by the Assyrian nationality of Holofernes, which made him an inevitable symbol of the threatening Ottoman Turks. The Italian Renaissance poet Lucrezia Tornabuoni chose Judith as one of the five subjects of her poetry on biblical figures.

A similar dynamic was created in the 16th century by the confessional strife of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. Both Protestants and Catholics draped themselves in the protective mantle of Judith and cast their &quot;heretical&quot; enemies as Holofernes.

In 16th-century France, writers such as Guillaume Du Bartas, Gabrielle de Coignard and Anne de Marquets composed poems on Judith&#x27;s triumph over Holofernes. Croatian poet and humanist Marko Marulić also wrote an epic on Judith&#x27;s story in 1501, the &quot;Judita&quot;. Italian poet and scholar Bartolomeo Tortoletti wrote a Latin epic on the Biblical character of Judith (&quot;Bartholomaei Tortoletti Iuditha uindex e uindicata&quot;, 1628). The Catholic tract &quot;A Treatise of Schisme&quot;, written in 1578 at Douai by the English Roman Catholic scholar Gregory Martin, included a paragraph in which Martin expressed confidence that &quot;the Catholic Hope would triumph, and pious Judith would slay Holofernes&quot;. This was interpreted by the English Protestant authorities at the time as incitement to slay Queen Elizabeth I. It served as the grounds for the death sentence passed on printer William Carter who had printed Martin&#x27;s tract and who was executed in 1584.

===In painting and sculpture===
The subject is one of the most commonly shown in the Power of Women &quot;topos&quot;. The account of Judith&#x27;s beheading of Holofernes has been treated by several painters and sculptors, most notably Donatello and Caravaggio, as well as Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna, Giorgione, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Titian, Horace Vernet, Gustav Klimt, Artemisia Gentileschi, Jan Sanders van Hemessen, Trophime Bigot, Francisco Goya, Francesco Cairo and Hermann-Paul. Also, Michelangelo depicts the scene in multiple aspects in one of the Pendentives, or four spandrels on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Judy Chicago included Judith with a place setting in &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;.
===In music and theatre===
The famous 40-voice motet &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, by English composer Thomas Tallis, is a setting of a text from the Book of Judith. The story also inspired oratorios by Antonio Vivaldi, W. A. Mozart and Hubert Parry, and an operetta by Jacob Pavlovitch Adler. Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed &quot;Judith sive Bethulia liberata&quot; H.391, oratorio for soloists, chorus, 2 flutes, strings, and continuo (? mid-1670s). Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre (EJG.30) and Sébastien de Brossard composed a cantata Judith.

Alessandro Scarlatti wrote an oratorio in 1693, &quot;La Giuditta&quot;, as did the Portuguese composer Francisco António de Almeida in 1726; &quot;Juditha triumphans&quot; was written in 1716 by Antonio Vivaldi; Mozart composed in 1771 &quot;La Betulia Liberata&quot; (KV 118), to a libretto by Pietro Metastasio. Arthur Honegger composed an oratorio, &quot;Judith&quot;, in 1925 to a libretto by René Morax. Operatic treatments exist by Russian composer Alexander Serov, &quot;Judith&quot;, by Austrian composer Emil von Reznicek, &quot;Holofernes&quot;, and &quot;Judith&quot; by German composer Siegfried Matthus. The French composer Jean Guillou wrote his Judith-Symphonie for Mezzo and Orchestra in 1970, premiered in Paris in 1972 and published by Schott-Music.

In 1840, Friedrich Hebbel&#x27;s play &quot;Judith&quot; was performed in Berlin. He deliberately departs from the biblical text:

I have no use for the biblical Judith. There, Judith is a widow who lures Holofernes into her web with wiles, when she has his head in her bag she sings and jubilates with all of Israel for three months. That is mean, such a nature is not worthy of her success [...]. My Judith is paralyzed by her deed, frozen by the thought that she might give birth to Holofernes&#x27; son; she knows that she has passed her boundaries, that she has, at the very least, done the right thing for the wrong reasons.

The story of Judith has been a favourite of latter-day playwrights; it was brought alive in 1892 by Abraham Goldfaden, who worked in Eastern Europe. The American playwright Thomas Bailey Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Judith of Bethulia&quot; was first performed in New York, 1905, and was the basis for the 1914 production &quot;Judith of Bethulia&quot; by director D. W. Griffith. A full hour in length, it was one of the earliest feature films made in the United States. English writer Arnold Bennett in 1919 tried his hand at dramaturgy with &quot;Judith&quot;, a faithful reproduction in three acts; it premiered in spring 1919 at Devonshire Park Theatre, Eastbourne. In 1981, the play &quot;Judith among the Lepers&quot; by the Israeli (Hebrew) playwright Moshe Shamir was performed in Israel. Shamir examines the question why the story of Judith was excluded from the Jewish (Hebrew) Bible and thus banned from Jewish history. In putting her story on stage he tries to reintegrate Judith&#x27;s story into Jewish history. English playwright Howard Barker examined the Judith story and its aftermath, first in the scene &quot;The Unforeseen Consequences of a Patriotic Act&quot;, as part of his collection of vignettes, &quot;The Possibilities&quot;. Barker later expanded the scene into a short play &quot;Judith&quot;.

<text>3D tic-tac-toe, also known by the trade name Qubic, is an abstract strategy board game, generally for two players. It is similar in concept to traditional tic-tac-toe but is played in a cubical array of cells, usually 4×4×4. Players take turns placing their markers in blank cells in the array. The first player to achieve four of their own markers in a row wins. The winning row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal on a single board as in regular tic-tac-toe, or vertically in a column, or a diagonal line through four boards.

As with traditional tic-tac-toe, several commercial sets of apparatus have been sold for the game, and it may also be played with pencil and paper with a hand-drawn board.

The game has been analyzed mathematically and a first-player-win strategy was developed and published. However, the strategy is too complicated for most human players to memorize and apply.

== Pencil and paper ==

Like traditional 3×3 tic-tac-toe, the game may be played with pencil and paper. A game board can easily be drawn by hand, with players using the usual &quot;naughts and crosses&quot; to mark their moves.

In the 1970s, 3M Games (a division of 3M Corporation) sold a series of &quot;Paper Games&quot;, including &quot;3 Dimensional Tic Tac Toe&quot;. Buyers received a pad of 50 sheets with preprinted game boards.

== Marker sizes variation ==

Gobblets Gobbler and Otrio, use marker sizes (small, medium, large) as the replacement of the third element. Players can &#x27;steal&#x27; the opponent spot by placing larger marker at the top of the opponent smaller marker or just simply competing with overlapping spot.

== &quot;Qubic&quot; ==

&quot;Qubic&quot; is the brand name of equipment for the 4×4×4 game that was manufactured and marketed by Parker Brothers, starting in 1964. It was reissued in 1972 with a more modern design. Both versions described the game as &quot;Parker Brothers 3D Tic Tac Toe Game&quot;.

In the original issue, the bottom level board was opaque plastic, and the upper three clear, all of simple square design. The 1972 reissue used four clear plastic boards with rounded corners. Whereas pencil and paper play almost always involves just two players, Parker Brothers&#x27; rules said that up to three players could play. The circular playing pieces resembled small poker chips in red, blue, and yellow.

The game is no longer manufactured.

== Gameplay and analysis ==

=== 3×3×3, two-player ===

The 3×3×3 version of the game cannot end in a draw and is easily won by the first player unless a rule is adopted that prevents the first player from taking the center cell on his first step. In that case, the game is easily won by the second player. By banning the use of the center cell altogether, the game is easily won by the first player. By including a 3rd player, the perfect game will be played out to a draw. By including stochasticity in the choosing of the side the player must use, the game becomes fair and winnable by all players but is subject to chance. By making the choice of the player piece (× or ⚬) subject to chance, the game becomes fair and winnable by all players.

=== 4×4×4, two-player ===

On the 4×4×4 board, there are 76 winning lines. On each of the four 4×4 boards, or horizontal planes, there are four columns, four rows, and two diagonals, accounting for 40 lines. There are 16 vertical lines, each ascending from a cell on the bottom board through the corresponding cells on the other boards. There are eight vertically-oriented planes parallel to the sides of the boards, each of these adding two more diagonals (the horizontal and vertical lines of these planes have already been counted). Finally, there are two vertically-oriented planes that include the diagonal lines of the 4x4 boards, and each of these contributes two more diagonal lines—each of these including two corners and two internal cells.

The 16 cells lying on these latter four lines (that is, the eight corner cells and eight internal cells) are each included in seven different winning lines; the other 48 cells (24 face cells and 24 edge cells) are each included in four winning lines.

The corner cells and the internal cells are actually equivalent via an automorphism; likewise for face and edge cells. The group of automorphisms of the game contains 192 automorphisms. It is made up of combinations of the usual rotations and reflections that reorient or reflect the cube, plus two that scramble the order of cells on each line. If a line comprises cells A, B, C and D in that order, one of these exchanges inner cells for outer ones (such as B, A, D, C) for all lines of the cube, and the other exchanges cells of either the inner or the outer cells (A, C, B, D or equivalently D, B, C, A) for all lines of the cube. Combinations of these basic automorphisms generate the entire group of 192 as shown by R. Silver in 1967.

3D tic-tac-toe was weakly solved, meaning that the existence of a winning strategy was proven but without actually presenting such a strategy, by Eugene Mahalko in 1976. He proved that in two-person play, the first player will win if there are two optimal players.

A more complete analysis, including the announcement of a complete first-player-win strategy, was published by Oren Patashnik in 1980. Patashnik used a computer-assisted proof that consumed 1500 hours of computer time. The strategy comprised move choices for 2929 difficult &quot;strategic&quot; positions, plus assurances that all other positions that could arise could be easily won with a sequence entirely made up of forcing moves. It was further asserted that the strategy had been independently verified. As computer storage became cheaper and the internet made it possible, these positions and moves were made available online.

The game was solved again by Victor Allis using proof-number search.

== Computer implementations ==
Several computer programs that play the game against a human opponent have been written. The earliest of these used console lights and switches, text terminals, or similar interaction: the human player would enter moves numerically (for example, using &quot;4 2 3&quot; for fourth level, second row, third column) and the program would respond similarly, as graphics displays were uncommon. 

A program written for the IBM 650 used front panel switches and lights for the user interface.

William Daly Jr. wrote and described a Qubic-playing program as part of his Master&#x27;s program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The program was written in assembler language for the TX-0 computer. It included lookahead to 12 moves and kept a history of previous games with each opponent, modifying its strategy according to their past behavior.

An implementation in Fortran was written by Robert K. Louden and presented, with an extensive description of its design, in his book &quot;Programming the IBM 1130 and 1800&quot;. Its strategy involved looking for combinations of one or two free cells shared among two or three rows with particular contents.

A Qubic program in a DEC dialect of BASIC appeared in &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; by David H. Ahl. Ahl said the program &quot;showed up&quot;, author unknown, on a G.E. timesharing system in 1968.

Atari released a 4x4x4 graphical version of the game for the Atari 2600 console and Atari 8-bit computers in 1978. The program was written by Carol Shaw, who went on to greater fame as the creator of Activision&#x27;s &quot;River Raid&quot;. It uses the standard joystick controller. It can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against the program on one of eight different difficulty settings. The product code for the Atari game was CX-2618.

Three-dimensional tic-tac-toe on a 4x4x4 board (optionally 3x3x3) was included in the Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack in the 1990s under the name &quot;TicTactics&quot;. In 2010, Microsoft made the game available on its &quot;Game Room&quot; service for its Xbox 360 console.

A program library named Qubist, and front-end for the GTK 2 window library are a project on SourceForge.

<text>JCSP is an implementation of communicating sequential processes (CSP) for the programming language Java.

Although CSP is a mathematical system, JCSP does not require in-depth mathematical skill, allowing instead that programmers can achieve well-behaved software by following simple rules.

==Overview==
There are four ways in which multi-threaded programs can fail untestably:
*&quot;Race conditions&quot; – shared variables may have indeterminate state because several threads access them concurrently without sufficient locking
*&quot;Deadlock&quot; – two or more threads reach a stalemate when they try to acquire locks or other resources in a conflicting way
*&quot;Livelock&quot; – similar to deadlock but resulting in endless waste of CPU time
*&quot;Starvation&quot; – one or more threads do no work, compromising the intended outcome of the software algorithms

Generally, it is not possible to prove the absence of these four hazards merely by rigorous testing. Although rigorous testing is necessary, it is not sufficient. Instead it is necessary to have a design that can demonstrate these four hazards don&#x27;t exist. CSP allows this to be done using mathematics and JCSP allows it to be done pragmatically in Java programs.

The benefit of the basis in mathematics is that stronger guarantees of correct behaviour can be produced than would be possible with conventional &quot;ad hoc&quot; development. Fortunately, JCSP does not force its users to adopt a mathematical approach themselves, but allows them to benefit from the mathematics that underpins the library.

Note that the CSP term &quot;process&quot; is used essentially as a synonym for &quot;thread&quot; in Java parlance; a &quot;process&quot; in CSP is a lightweight unit of execution that interacts with the outside world via events and is an active component that encapsulates the data structures on which it operates.

Because the encapsulation of data is per-thread (per &quot;process&quot; in CSP parlance), there is typically no reliance on sharing data between threads. Instead, the coupling between threads happens via well-defined communication points and rendezvous. The benefit is that each thread can broadly be considered to be a &quot;single-threaded&quot; entity during its design, sparing the developer from the uncertainties of whether and where to use Java&#x27;s &quot;synchronized&quot; keyword, and at the same time guaranteeing freedom from race conditions. JCSP provides for clear principles for designing the inter-thread communication in a way that is provably free from deadlock.

There is a clear similarity between some classes in the standard Java API () and some in JCSP. JCSP&#x27;s &quot;channel&quot; classes are similar to the &quot;BlockingQueue&quot;. There is one important difference: JCSP also provides an class to allow selection between inputs; this capability is absent from the standard Java API. Alternation is one of the core concepts that CSP uses to model events in the real world.

 was proven to operate correctly by exhaustive mathematical analysis of its state space, guaranteeing it can never in itself cause a deadlock. As such, it epitomises the dependability of JCSP from its mathematical basis.

==Networking Layer==
Because Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sockets can be constructed to behave as blocking channels in the CSP sense, it is possible to distribute JCSP processes across multiple computers. This is achieved using the JCSP Net extension that provides channels with CSP semantics using TCP. Because CSP is compositional, it does not matter in behaviour terms whether processes are co-located or distributed. The only difference is in the relative performance. So it is possible, for example, to develop an application on a single server then compare multi-processor version of the same application with the aim of optimising the performance.

==Other versions ==
===Robot edition===
JCSP re is a highly reduced version of the JCSP packages developed around 2008 at the Napier University Edinburgh by Professor Jon Kerridge, Alex Panayotopoulos and Patrick Lismore. Research into JCSP for robotics environments and JCSP for mobile environments is an active area of research at Napier University Edinburgh. The working implementation of &#x27;JCSP re&#x27; allows the development of the same concurrent software for robots. Specifically, the robots targeted for this research were the Lego Mindstorms NXTs because they can run the popular LeJOS NXJ virtual machine that executes Java source code.

==Using JCSP from other languages==
JCSP is essentially a pure-Java API (although a research alternative exists that uses the C-CSP extension to the JVM). As such, it is in principle eminently suitable for concurrency in Scala and Groovy applications as well as Java ones.

JCSP can therefore provide an alternative to Scala&#x27;s actor model. JCSP uses synchronised communication and actors use buffered (asynchronous) communication, each of which have their advantages in certain circumstances. JCSP allows its channels to be buffered so can easily emulate the actor model; the converse is not true.

<doc id="420471" wikidata="Q1786131" url="?curid=420471" title="You Don't Know Jack (franchise)">
<text>You Don&#x27;t Know Jack is a series of video games developed by Jackbox Games (formerly known as Jellyvision Games) and Berkeley Systems, as well as the title of the first &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; game in the series. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;, framed as a game show &quot;where high culture and pop culture collide&quot;, combines trivia with comedy.

While it is primarily a PC and Mac-based franchise with over two dozen releases and compilations for those platforms, there have been a few entries released for consoles: two for the original PlayStation, and the 2011 release which had versions for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS and Wii. In 2012, Jackbox Games developed and published a social version of the game on Facebook with cross-platform versions subsequently released for Roku, iOS, Android and Kindle. On November 5, 2013, the majority of the franchise&#x27;s many volumes and spinoffs were reissued onto Steam by Jackbox Games.

On November 18, 2014, &quot;You Don’t Know Jack 2015&quot; was released as part of &quot;The Jackbox Party Pack&quot; on Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and later Nintendo Switch, iPad, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV, and Xfinity X1. On October 17, 2018, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack: Full Stream&quot; was released as part of &quot;The Jackbox Party Pack 5&quot; for the same platforms as &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack 2015,&quot; with the exception of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360&quot;.&quot;

== History ==
In 1991, Jellyvision&#x27;s former identity, Learn Television, released the award-winning film &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Treasure Chest&quot;, which featured lead character Jack Patterson. When Learn Television sought to use new multimedia technologies to create a more active learning experience, the company teamed up with Follett Software Company and developed &quot;That&#x27;s a Fact, Jack!&quot;, a reading motivation CD-ROM game show series covering young adult fiction, targeted to 3rd through 10th graders. The game would give a title for a child to read, and then ask questions related to that title.

The idea for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; began while &quot;That&#x27;s a Fact, Jack!&quot; was still in development. The game&#x27;s title comes from the more vulgar version of the phrase: &quot;You don&#x27;t know &quot;.

== Gameplay ==
The game can be played by up to eight players, depending on the version. All versions of the game feature the voice of an off-screen host, who reads questions aloud, provides instructions regarding special question types, and pokes fun at the players.
The game usually opens with a green room segment, in which the players are prompted to enter their names and given instructions for play. Each game lasts for a number of questions, commonly 11 in later games.

The category of the questions may be pre-determined, or selected by one of the players. Most questions are multiple choice and must be answered within a time limit. Depending on the game, players answer separately or buzz in to give an answer. Correct answers awards money while incorrect answers (or sometimes not answering) deducts money. The money value of each question vary across a game. There are occasionally other question types offered (see below).

Players are also given the opportunity to &quot;screw&quot; other players, which forces them to answer the question or make the question harder to answer. Players choosing to &quot;screw&quot; receive additional money if the &quot;screwed&quot; players answer incorrectly, but may be penalized if otherwise.

=== Question types ===
The majority of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; questions are multiple choice, with four possible choices. Some questions are fill-in-the-blank, requiring a typed response.

Special questions are also played during the game. Each version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; has its own different types of special questions. Some of the most common are the &quot;DisOrDat&quot;, in which players must determine which of two categories the given subjects fall under (such as if Jay Leno was a daytime or a nighttime talk show host, if orecchiette is a type of pasta or a parasite) and the &quot;Gibberish Question&quot;, involving a nonsensical phrase whose syllables rhyme with a more common phrase or title (for example, &quot;Pre-empt Tires, Like Crack&quot; could be the gibberish to &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;).

=== Jack Attack ===
The final round of the game, called the Jack Attack in most versions, is a word association question. A word, phrase, or name appears in the middle of the screen, to which the player must find associated words or phrases that fits the overall category. For example, &quot;Star Wars&quot; might be the associated word, and the correct answer fitting &quot;movie stars&quot; could be Harrison Ford. For each associated subject, several potential matches appear and the players win money by buzzing in when the correct match appears, or by selecting the correct matches.

In all versions of the game, the running total of each player&#x27;s score is not shown anywhere on the screen during Jack Attack, and this part of the game is usually accompanied by ominous music or ambient sounds. This creates tension between players because of the uncertainty of ranking, and the unsettling atmosphere.

=== Game show theme ===
Throughout the &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; franchise, there has been a running theme of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; taking place on a self-titled televised game show where the players are the contestants. This idea is shown by satirical fake commercials that can be heard while starting the game, and in most games, after the game has finished.

== Reception ==
The &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; series shipped 500,000 units by December 1996. Shipments in the United States alone rose to nearly 1 million by February 1998. By 2001, the &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; series had totaled sales of 3.5 million copies. &quot;YDKJ&quot; sold above 4.5 million copies and drew revenues above $100 million by 2008.

Inside Mac Games named &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack 2&quot; the best puzzle game of 1996. The editors wrote that it &quot;continues the high standards established by Berkeley&#x27;s breakaway classic&quot;. It received a score of 4 out of 5 from &quot;MacUser&quot;.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack Movies&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1997 &quot;Puzzle Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Smart Games Challenge 2&quot;. The editors called &quot;Movies&quot; a &quot;hilarious party game&quot;, and noted that it &quot;came a close second&quot;.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack XL&quot; won two 1996 Spotlight Awards, for &quot;Best Script, Story or Interactive Writing&quot; and &quot;Best Trivia or Puzzle Game&quot;.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack Vol. 3&quot; was the finalist for GameSpot&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Best Puzzles and Classics Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Chessmaster 5500&quot;. The editors wrote, &quot;[I]f it weren&#x27;t for the addition of the Threeway question format (which is a complete dud), &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack III&quot; would have reached instant-classic status.&quot;

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack Vol. 4: The Ride&quot; won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s award for the best classic game of 1998. The editors wrote, &quot;&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack Vol. 4: The Ride&quot; ranks easily as the best since the first of the series found its way into the &quot;CGW&quot; Hall of Fame. And for that we salute the folks at Berkeley Systems and Jellyvision, game designers who really do know &quot;Jack&quot;, at least where our funny bones are concerned.&quot; It also won the 1998 Spotlight Award for &quot;Best Trivia, Puzzle or Classic Game&quot; from the Game Developers Conference.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack: Huge&quot; received a score of 4.5 out of 5 from Michael Gowan of &quot;Macworld&quot;, who wrote that the game &quot;will strain your brain while amusing you with its witty banter and rapid-fire action.&quot; In 1998, The &quot;Huge&quot; collection was named the 48th-best computer game of all time by &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;, whose editors called it &quot;essential stuff.&quot;

== Other media ==
&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; appeared as two books: &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack: The Book&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack: The TV Book&quot;. Both were published in 1998 by Running Press.

There was also a Tiger Electronic tabletop game of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;, emceed by Nate Shapiro. It featured question cards with a number code on them and a grey button to open a sliding door to show the answers. It was the first game to feature 4 players instead of 3 players. There were also &quot;Sports&quot;, &quot;Movies&quot;, and &quot;TV&quot; question packs that were sold separately. A standalone handheld version was also released.

An actual television show version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; had a brief run on ABC in prime time during the summer of 2001. It starred Paul Reubens (the actor and comedian best known for his character Pee-wee Herman) as over-the-top game show host Troy Stevens, with Tom Gottlieb&#x27;s &#x27;Cookie&#x27; as the announcer. The show lasted only six episodes, as it received very little buzz and most &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; fans weren&#x27;t even aware of its existence until long after its cancellation. A previous attempt had been made by Telepictures Productions and Warner Bros. Television in 1996, produced by Ron Greenberg in Chicago; this version, intended as a weekday syndicated show, was not picked up (after initial tests and run-throughs necessitated a retooling of the show; Telepictures subsequently chose to drop the project).

After the &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; TV show ended, another show from the makers of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; called &quot;Smush&quot; aired on USA Network in late 2001. It was a game of taking two or more words and combining them into one long word. The show started late at night, but was later pushed to later and later times, even up to 3:00 A.M.; until it was eventually canceled.

In 2001, AMC released &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack about MonsterFest&quot;, an online game on their website emceed by Schmitty, and the MonsterFest movie marathon was hosted by Clive Barker and Carmen Electra, who gave clues for the game.

<doc id="420478" wikidata="Q318998" url="?curid=420478" title="Han Yu">
<text>Han Yu (; 76825 December 824), courtesy name Tuizhi (), and commonly known by his posthumous name Han Wengong (韓文公), was an essayist, Confucian scholar, poet, and government official during the Tang dynasty who significantly influenced the development of Neo-Confucianism. Described as &quot;comparable in stature to Dante, Shakespeare or Goethe&quot; for his influence on the Chinese literary tradition, Han Yu stood for strong central authority in politics and orthodoxy in cultural matters.

He is often considered to be among China&#x27;s finest prose writers. Ming dynasty scholar Mao Kun () ranked him first among the &quot;Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song&quot;.

==Biography==
Han Yu was born in 768, in Heyang (河陽, present day Mengzhou) in Henan to a family of noble lineage. His father worked as a minor official but died when Han Yu was two. He was then raised in the family of his older brother, Han Hui (). He was a student of philosophical writings and Confucian thought. His family moved to Chang&#x27;an in 774 but was banished to Southern China in 777 because of its association with disgraced minister Yuan Zai. Han Hui died in 781 while serving as a prefect in Guangdong province. In 792, after four attempts, Han Yu passed the &quot;jinshi&quot; imperial examination. In 796, after failing to secure a position in the civil service at the capital, he went into the service of the provincial military governor of Bianzhou until 799, and then of the military governor of Xuzhou. He gained his first central government position in 802 on the recommendation of the military governor. However, he was soon exiled for several possible reasons: for failing to support the heir apparent&#x27;s faction, his criticism of the misbehavior of the emperor&#x27;s servants, or his request for reduction of taxes during a famine.

From 807 to 819 he held a series of government posts, first in Luoyang and then in Chang&#x27;an. During these years, he was a strong advocate of reimposing central control over separatist northeastern provinces. This period of service came to an end when he wrote his famous Memorial on Bone-relics of the Buddha () presented to Emperor Xianzong. The memorial is a strongly worded protest against Buddhist influence on the country. The Emperor, offended by Han Yu&#x27;s criticism, ordered his execution. He was however saved by his friends at the court, and was thusly demoted and exiled to Chaozhou instead. After Han Yu offered a formal apology to the Emperor a few months later, he was transferred to a province nearer to the capital. Emperor Xianzong died within a year, and his successor Emperor Muzong brought Han Yu back to the capital where he worked in the War Office. He was then appointed to a high-ranking position after he successfully completed a mission to persuade a rebellious military commander to return to the fold.

Han Yu held a number of other distinguished government posts such as the rector of the Imperial university. At the age of fifty-six, Han Yu died in Chang&#x27;an on December 25, 824 and was buried on April 21, 825 in the ancestral cemetery at Heyang.

== Thoughts and beliefs ==
Although generally not considered a philosopher, Han Yu was an important Confucian intellectual who influenced later generations of Confucian thinkers and Confucian philosophy. He also sponsored many literary figures of the turn of the ninth century. He led a revolt against &quot;pianwen&quot; (), a formal, richly ornamented literary style, advocating a return to a classical, simple, logical, and exact style. He felt that this classical style of writing—called &quot;guwen&quot; (), literally, &quot;ancient writing&quot;—would be appropriate for the restoration of Confucianism.

Han Yu promoted Confucianism but was also deeply opposed to Buddhism, a religion that was then popular at the Tang court. In 819, he sent a letter, &quot;Memorial on Bone-relics of the Buddha&quot;, to the emperor in which he denounced &quot;the elaborate preparations being made by the state to receive the Buddha&#x27;s fingerbone, which he called &#x27;a filthy object&#x27; and which he said should be &#x27;handed over to the proper officials for destruction by water and fire to eradicate forever its origin&#x27;. Han Yu contrasted the Chinese civilization and barbarism where people were &quot;like birds and wild beast or like the barbarians&quot;. He considered Buddhism to be of barbarian () origin, therefore an unsuitable religion for the Chinese people.

Again from Han Yu&#x27;s letter, &quot;Memorial on Bone-relics of the Buddha&quot;: 

&quot;Your servant begs leave to say that Buddhism is no more than a cult of the barbarian peoples which
spread to China. It did not exist here in ancient times.
Now I hear that Your Majesty has ordered the community of monks to go to greet the finger bone of the
Buddha [a relic from India], and that Your Majesty will ascend a tower to watch the procession as this
relic is brought into the palace. [...]
The Buddha was a man of the barbarians who did not speak Chinese and who wore clothes of a different
fashion. The Buddha’s sayings contain nothing about our ancient kings and the Buddha’s manner of
dress did not conform to our laws; he understood neither the duties that bind sovereign and subject,
not the affections of father and son. If the Buddha were still alive today and came to our court, Your
Majesty might condescend to receive him, but he would then be escorted to the borders of the nation,
dismissed, and not allowed to delude the masses. How then, when he has long been dead, could the
Buddha’s rotten bones, the foul and unlucky remains of his body, be rightly admitted to the palace?
Confucius said: “Respect ghosts and spirits, but keep them at a distance!” Your servant is deeply
ashamed and begs that this bone from the Buddha be given to the proper authorities to be cast into fire
and water, that this evil be rooted out, and later generations spared this delusion.&quot;

Han Yu was also critical of Taoism, which he considered to be a harmful accretion to Chinese culture. He nevertheless made the distinction between Taoism, a homegrown religion, and Buddhism, a foreign faith. In &quot;The Origin of Dao&quot; (原道, &quot;Yuandao&quot;), he argued that the monasticism of both Buddhism and Taoism to be economically nonproductive, creating economic and social dislocation. He also criticized both of these beliefs for being unable to deal with social problems. He considered Confucianism to be distinct from these two beliefs in linking the private, moral life of the individual with the public welfare of the state. He emphasized Mencius&#x27;s method of assuring public morality and social order, and his concept of the expression of Confucian spirituality through political action would later form the intellectual basis for neo-Confucianism. Han introduced the ideas of the succession of the Way (道統, &quot;daotong&quot;), as well as the concept of the &quot;teacher&quot; (師, &quot;shi&quot;) who embodies the Way as expressed in &quot;Discourse on Teachers&quot; (師說, &quot;Shishuo&quot;). Although Han Yu attacked Buddhism and Taoism, some of his ideas have Buddhist and/or Taoist roots; for example, the succession of the Way was inspired by the Buddhist idea of transmission of the &quot;dharma&quot;, while his concept of the &quot;teacher&quot; originated from the Buddhist and Taoist idea of religious mentor.

In his &quot;Discourse on Teachers&quot; (師說, &quot;Shishuo&quot;), Han Yu discussed the necessity and principles of learning from teachers, and criticized the phenomenon of &quot;shame to learn from the teacher&quot; in the society at that time. He stated that &quot;a disciple need not be necessarily inferior to the teacher, [while] the teacher need not be necessarily more virtuous than the disciple. The only fact is that [one may] acquire &quot;Dao&quot; earlier or later [than the others], [and there may be] specific field that one specialized in.&quot;

==Literary works==

===Prose===
Han Yu is often considered the greatest master of classical prose in the Tang. He was listed first among the &quot;Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song&quot; by Ming Dynasty scholar Mao Kun. Together with Liu Zongyuan he headed the Classical Prose Movement to return to the unornamented prose of the Han Dynasty. He considered the classical &quot;old style prose&quot; (古文, &quot;guwen&quot;) to be the kind of writing more suited to argumentation and the expression of ideas. Han Yu&#x27;s &quot;guwen&quot; however was not an imitation of ancient prose, but a new style based on the ancient ideals of clarity, concision, and utility. Han Yu wrote in many modes, often with discursiveness and daring experimentation.

Among his most renowned essays are his polemics against Buddhism and Taoism and support for Confucianism, such as &quot;Buddhism Memorial on Bone-relics of the Buddha&quot; and &quot;The Origin of Dao&quot;. Other notable works include &quot;Text for the Crocodiles&quot; () in which he declares that crocodiles be formally banished from Chaozhou, and &quot;Goodbye to Penury&quot; () that describes his failed attempt to rid himself of the ghost of poverty.

===Poetry===
Han Yu also wrote poetry. However, while Han Yu&#x27;s essays are highly regarded, his poetry is not considered exceptional. According to &quot;A History of Chinese Literature&quot; by Herbert Giles, Han Yu &quot;wrote a large quantity of verse, frequently playful, on an immense variety of subjects, and under his touch the commonplace was often transmuted into wit. Among other pieces there is one on his teeth, which seemed to drop out at regular intervals, so that he could calculate roughly what span of life remained to him. Altogether, his poetry cannot be classed with that of the highest order, unlike his prose writings&quot;.

The poem where Han Yu ruminated on getting old by recounting how he lost his own teeth is &quot;Losing Teeth&quot; ().

==Significance and assessment==

Han Yu ranks among the most important personalities in the history of traditional Chinese culture. His works not only become classics in Chinese literature, but his writings redefined and changed the course of the tradition itself. He was a stylistic innovator in the many genres he wrote in, and was a major influence on the literary and intellectual life of his time as well as later dynasties. The writings of Han Yu were influential to Song Dynasty writers and poets, in particular Ouyang Xiu who popularized the use of &quot;guwen&quot; as advocated by Han Yu, a style that would stay as the model for Chinese prose until the revolution in Chinese literature of modern China. In an inscription for a shrine to Han Yu, Song Dynasty poet Su Shi praised Han Yu:

All the major accounts of Han Yu&#x27;s life agree that he had an open and forthright character, which manifested itself in his unswerving loyalty to his friends. According to Li Ao, Han Yu was a great conversationalist and an inspired teacher: &quot;His teaching and his efforts to mold his students were unrelenting, fearing they would not be perfect. Yet he amused them with jokes and with the chanting of poems, so that they were enraptured with his teaching and forgot about returning home&quot;. The sense of humor that is so obvious in his writing was also important in his life. Herbert Giles judged that it was &quot;due to his calm and dignified patriotism that the Chinese still keep his memory green&quot;.

Han Yu led a defense of Confucianism at a time when Confucian doctrine was in decline, and attacked both Buddhism and Taoism which were then the dominant belief systems. His writings would have a significant influence on Neo-Confucians of later eras, such as the Song dynasty scholars Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi. Although usually not considered a philosopher, he introduced a new intellectual direction for Confucianism as well as influential ideas to later Confucians. However, he was criticized by Song Confucians for being much more of a stylist than a moralist.

Most modern scholarship, although content to assign to Han Yu a secure place in the history of Chinese literature, has been embarrassed by the violence of his Confucian passions.

==Memorial==

In honor of Han&#x27;s contribution to Chaoshan when he was exiled to Chaozhou, the Han River flowing through Chaozhou is named after him. Han Yu Temple () in Chaozhou was established since the Song dynasty at the riverside of Mount Han, which also named after him. Due to his dealings with crocodiles in South China, the extinct gharial &quot;Hanyusuchus&quot; was named after him in 2022.

==Studies==
Erwin von Zach wrote &quot;Han Yüs poetische Werke&quot;, a German language study. &quot;The Poetry of Meng Chiao and Han Yü&quot;, a book by Stephen Owen published by the Yale University Press, was the first substantial English-language study of Han Yu. It was published 13 years after Zach&#x27;s book.

==Modern references==
In an essay on Kafka, the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, in making the argument that &quot;each writer creates his own precursors&quot;, placed Han Yu as one of the antecedents of Kafka due to some resemblance between them.

==Descendants==
Han Yu&#x27;s descendants held the title of &quot;Wujing boshi&quot; (; Wǔjīng bóshì).

<text>Aroup Chatterjee (born 23 June 1958) is a British Indian author and physician. He was born in Calcutta, and moved to the United Kingdom in 1985. He is the author of the book &quot;Mother Teresa: The Untold Story&quot; (originally published as &quot;Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict&quot;), a work which challenges the widespread regard of Mother Teresa as a symbol of philanthropy and selflessness.

Chatterjee&#x27;s criticism inspired the documentary &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel&quot; that was shown on Channel 4, a British television channel. The documentary was written by a well-known critic of Mother Teresa, Christopher Hitchens, who co-produced it with journalist and filmmaker Tariq Ali. Chatterjee and Hitchens were the two Devil&#x27;s advocates, or hostile witnesses to Catholic Church procedures for the beatification of Mother Teresa in 2003.

==Life and career==

Chatterjee was born in 1958 and raised in the city of Calcutta, West Bengal, India, before moving to the United Kingdom in 1985. In the 1970s and 1980s while studying at Calcutta Medical College he worked part-time for a left-wing political party campaigning against poverty and later worked at a hospital where he regularly treated patients from the oldest and poorest districts of the city as well as refugees from the civil war with what is now Bangladesh. Later, while living in the UK, he became concerned by the increasingly common portrayal of the widespread destitution and disease in his native Calcutta which stemmed from press reporting of the work of Mother Teresa. At that point he describes his attitude to Mother Teresa as &quot;If anything, I was positively inclined towards her&quot; although he says he never saw any of her nuns in the slums. However it was this image at odds with his own experience as a doctor in Calcutta that caused him to look more closely at her work and reputation.
From the 1990s onwards he began to uncover what he calls a &quot;cult of suffering&quot; which Mother Teresa and her followers in the Missionaries of Charity were running back in Calcutta supported by her friend Pope John Paul II.
In February 1993, Chatterjee sent a proposal for a short documentary to Vanya Del Borgo, associate producer of Bandung Productions which was owned by Tariq Ali. The proposal was passed to a Channel 4 commissioner who approved it, and Del Borgo with Chatterjee&#x27;s proposal began work, approaching journalist and author Christopher Hitchens to write and present it. The documentary became the 1994 film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel&quot;. Chatterjee found the documentary &quot;too sensationalist&quot; and Hitchens went on to write his book &quot;The Missionary Position&quot;.
Chatterjee spent the next year travelling and interviewing people who had worked closely with Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity and began to campaign against the conditions in Nirmal Hriday, also known as the Kalighat Home for the Dying in Calcutta. In particular he heard stories of lack of basic hygiene, the absence of any pain medication and the frequent reuse of hypodermic needles.
Chatterjee then began work on a book, eventually released by Meteor Books in 2002 under the original title &quot;Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict&quot;. Chatterjee says in addition to the hours of interviews, &quot;I started in pre Internet days and I spent months in libraries in London. I also travelled the world researching it. I followed slum dwellers, beggars, destitute children with a video camera. I interviewed hundreds of people. I stood with video camera outside Teresa&#x27;s home for hours.&quot;

Following the publication of his book, Chatterjee continued to speak out against what he calls the &quot;bogus and fantastic figure&quot; of Mother Teresa, acting as Devil&#x27;s advocate in the process of her sainthood. He continues to work as a physician in London where he lives with his Irish wife, who was raised as a Catholic, and their three children.

==&quot;Mother Teresa: The Untold Story&quot;==

In December 2002 independent publisher Meteor Books, owned by Bhagbat Chakraborty, published Chatterjee&#x27;s book under the title &quot;Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict&quot;. In 2016 the same book was reissued under a new title, &quot;Mother Teresa: The Untold Story&quot; by Fingerprint! publishers after being taken up by literary agent Kanishka Gupta. The book covers her life and her rise to fame following the documentary &quot;Something Beautiful for God&quot; by Malcolm Muggeridge, the Calcutta home for the dying and the practices of running it, the non-consensual death bed baptisms of Hindus and Muslims, the pathetic hygienic practices in the homes run by her, her very limited connections with Kolkata and the masses and the vast amount of financial donations given to the charity but not spent at Nirmal Hriday. He covers her Nobel Peace Prize and the speech in which she claimed to have saved tens of thousands of destitute people; Chatterjee estimates in his book the real number was 700. He also writes about the celebrities and the powerful people who had audiences with her, and the controversies surrounding the money she accepted from dictators such as Haitian president Jean-Claude Duvalier, convicted fraudster Charles Keating and disgraced publisher Robert Maxwell. The book looks at the worldwide reach of the Missionaries of Charity and examines the available evidence for her financial accounts along with her personal crusade against abortion and contraception. He blames the West, especially the United States, for creating her benevolent image as a saviour in the backdrops of a ravaged subcontinent. The final chapters address her death, funeral and beatification and Chatterjee&#x27;s own involvement as an official Devil&#x27;s advocate or hostile witness and the transcripts of the proceedings. Chatterjee sums up his view of Mother Teresa&#x27;s life&#x27;s work as: 

=== Critical reception ===
The self-published book has been praised for the content. &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; praised the book as necessary and well-documented, which could have been improved with editing. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; praised the content and advocated for its wide dissemination in light of its seriousness but noted Chatterjee&#x27;s personal agenda to have undermined its credibility. It criticized the book for suffering from glaring errors of syntax, missing words, repetitions et al. and for his often contradictory assertions. A review by Tim Challies praised the extensive documentation in the book, consisting of multitude of examples, though noting the shoddy organizing, as a result of being self-published. The far-left &quot;Socialist Review&quot; favourably received it as &quot;a valuable contribution to unmasking the real Teresa&quot;. 

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; praised the 2016 reprint as a brutally honest and relentlessly scathing read which gives readers an impartial point of view. A review in &quot;The Quint&quot; described it as a disconcerting book that had exhaustive details and consisted of laborious arguments though parts of it did appear to be inarticulate rants and failed to be objective.

==Devil&#x27;s advocate==

On the path to Mother Teresa&#x27;s sainthood, a process Chatterjee has described as &quot;a superstitious, black magic ceremony&quot;, Chatterjee acted as one of two official Devil&#x27;s advocates during the process of her beatification in 2003, the other being Christopher Hitchens. In order to begin the requirements of beatification, the first step on the way to sainthood, the Catholic Church was required to announce a first miracle ascribed to Mother Teresa, which it did on 1 December 2002, the alleged miraculous cure of Monica Besra of a cyst caused by tuberculosis. Chatterjee pointed out the cure was a result of medical treatment Besra received from superintendent of the Balurghat Hospital and not the placing of metal jewellery on her body. His position was also confirmed by her doctor Ranjan Mustafi, speaking of the nine months of drugs and treatment he provided: &quot;I&#x27;ve said several times that she was cured by the treatment.&quot; Initially both Besra and her husband called the miracle &quot;a hoax&quot;, as did Prabir Ghosh from the Kolkata Humanist Association, who runs a programme raising awareness of holy men who dupe ordinary Indians into paying for supposed miracle cures. During the process, the Catholic Church allows consultation with doubters where the miracle is contested. In his book, Chatterjee details his deposition to the committee, his correspondence with the official postulator Brian Kolodiejchuk, and the transcripts of his questions and answers.

<doc id="420483" wikidata="Q313324" url="?curid=420483" title="Bai Juyi">
<text>Bai Juyi (also Bo Juyi or Po Chü-i; ; 772–846), courtesy name Letian (樂天), was a Chinese musician, poet, and politician during the Tang dynasty. Many of his poems concern his career or observations made about everyday life, including as governor of three different provinces. He achieved fame as a writer of verse in a low-key, near vernacular style that was popular throughout medieval East Asia.

Bai was also influential in the historical development of Japanese literature, where he is better known by the on&#x27;yomi reading of his courtesy name, Haku Rakuten (shinjitai: 白楽天). His younger brother Bai Xingjian was a short story writer.

Among his most famous works are the long narrative poems &quot;Chang Hen Ge&quot; (&quot;Song of Everlasting Sorrow&quot;), which tells the story of Yang Guifei, and &quot;Pipa xing&quot; (&quot;Song of the Pipa&quot;).

==Life==
Bai Juyi lived during the Middle Tang period. This was a period of rebuilding and recovery for the Tang Empire, following the An Lushan Rebellion, and following the poetically flourishing era famous for Li Bai (701－762), Wang Wei (701－761), and Du Fu (712－770). Bai Juyi lived through the reigns of eight or nine emperors, being born in the &quot;Dali&quot; regnal era (766-779) of Emperor Daizong of Tang. He had a long and successful career both as a government official and a poet, although these two facets of his career seemed to have come in conflict with each other at certain points. Bai Juyi was also a devoted Chan Buddhist.

===Birth and childhood===
Bai Juyi was born in 772 in Taiyuan, Shanxi, which was then a few miles from location of the modern city, although he was in Zhengyang, Henan for most of his childhood. His family was poor but scholarly, his father being an Assistant Department Magistrate of the second-class. At the age of ten he was sent away from his family to avoid a war that broke out in the north of China, and went to live with relatives in the area known as Jiangnan, more specifically Xuzhou. Bai Juyi&#x27;s father died in 794, his father&#x27;s death caused his family to undergo hard times.

===Early career===
Bai Juyi&#x27;s official was delayed by seven years due to his father&#x27;s death. He passed the &quot;jinshi&quot; examinations in 800. Bai Juyi may have taken up residence in the western capital city of Chang&#x27;an, in 801. Not long after this, Bai Juyi formed a long friendship with a scholar Yuan Zhen. 806, the first full year of the reign of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, was the year when Bai Juyi was appointed to a minor post as a government official, at Zhouzhi, which was not far from Chang&#x27;an (and also in Shaanxi province). He was made a member (scholar) of the Hanlin Academy, in 807, and Reminder of the Left from 807 until 815, except when in 811 his mother died, and he spent the traditional three-year mourning period again along the Wei River, before returning to court in the winter of 814, where he held the title of Assistant Secretary to the Prince&#x27;s Tutor. It was not a high-ranking position, but nevertheless one which he was soon to lose.

===Exile===

While serving as a minor palace official in 814, Bai managed to get himself in official trouble. He made enemies at court and with certain individuals in other positions. It was partly his written works which led him into trouble. He wrote two long memorials, translated by Arthur Waley as &quot;On Stopping the War&quot;, regarding what he considered to be an overly lengthy campaign against a minor group of Tatars; and he wrote a series of poems, in which he satirized the actions of greedy officials and highlighting the sufferings of the common folk.

At this time, one of the post-An Lushan warlords (&quot;jiedushi&quot;), Wu Yuanji in Henan, had seized control of Zhangyi Circuit (centered in Zhumadian), an act for which he sought reconciliation with the imperial government, trying to get an imperial pardon as a necessary prerequisite. Despite the intercession of influential friends, Wu was denied, thus officially putting him in the position of rebellion. Still seeking a pardon, Wu turned to assassination, blaming the Prime Minister, Wu Yuanheng, and other officials: the imperial court generally began by dawn, requiring the ministers to rise early in order to attend in a timely manner; and, on July 13, 815, before dawn, the Tang Prime Minister Wu Yuanheng was set to go to the palace for a meeting with Emperor Xianzong. As he left his house, arrows were fired at his retinue. His servants all fled, and the assassins seized Wu Yuanheng and his horse, and then decapitated him, taking his head with them. The assassins also attacked another official who favored the campaign against the rebellious warlords, Pei Du, but was unable to kill him. The people at the capital were shocked and there was turmoil, with officials refusing to leave their personal residences until after dawn.
In this context, Bai Juyi overstepped his minor position by memorializing the emperor. As Assistant Secretary to the Prince&#x27;s Tutor, Bai&#x27;s memorial was a breach of protocol — he should have waited for those of censorial authority to take the lead before offering his own criticism. This was not the only charge which his opponents used against him. His mother had died, apparently caused by falling into a well while looking at some flowers, and two poems written by Bai Juyi — the titles of which Waley translates as &quot;In Praise of Flowers&quot; and &quot;The New Well&quot; — were used against him as a sign of lack of Filial Piety, one of the Confucian ideals. The result was exile. Bai Juyi was demoted to the rank of Sub-Prefect and banished from the court and the capital city to Jiujiang, then known as Xun Yang, on the southern shores of the Yangtze River in northwest Jiangxi Province. After three years, he was sent as Governor of a remote place in Sichuan. At the time, the main travel route there was up the Yangzi River. This trip allowed Bai Juyi a few days to visit his friend Yuan Zhen, who was also in exile and with whom he explored the rock caves located at Yichang. Bai Juyi was delighted by the flowers and trees for which his new location was noted. In 819, he was recalled back to the capital, ending his exile.

===Return to the capital and a new emperor===
In 819, Bai Juyi was recalled to the capital and given the position of second-class Assistant Secretary. In 821, China got a new emperor, Muzong. After succeeding to the throne, Muzong spent his time feasting and heavily drinking and neglecting his duties as emperor. Meanwhile, the temporarily subdued regional military governors, &quot;jiedushi&quot;, began to challenge the central Tang government, leading to the new de facto independence of three circuits north of the Yellow River, which had been previously subdued by Emperor Xianzong. Furthermore, Muzong&#x27;s administration was characterized by massive corruption. Again, Bai Juyi wrote a series of memorials in remonstrance.

===As Governor of Hangzhou===
Again, Bai Juyi was sent away from the court and the capital, but this time to the important position of the thriving town of Hangzhou, which was at the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and located in the scenic neighborhood of West Lake. Fortunately for their friendship, Yuan Zhen at the time was serving an assignment in nearby Ningbo, also in what is today Zhejiang, so the two could occasionally get together, at least until Bai Juyi&#x27;s term as Governor expired.

As governor of Hangzhou, Bai Juyi realized that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but, due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dike had collapsed and the lake had dried out to the point that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dike, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation, relieving the drought, and improving the livelihood of the local people over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake, visiting the lake almost every day. He ordered the construction of a causeway to allow walking on foot, instead of requiring the services of a boat. A causeway in the West Lake (Baisha Causeway, 白沙堤) was later referred to as Bai Causeway in Bai Juyi&#x27;s honor, but the original causeway built by Bai Juyi named Baigong Causeway () no longer exists.

===Life near Luoyang===
In 824, Bai Juyi&#x27;s commission as governor expired, and he received the nominal rank of Imperial Tutor, which provided more in the way of official salary than official duties, and he relocated his household to a suburb of the &quot;eastern capital,&quot; Luoyang. At the time, Luoyang was known as the eastern capital of the empire and was a major metropolis with a population of around one million and a reputation as the &quot;cultural capital,&quot; as opposed to the more politically oriented capital of Chang&#x27;an.

===Governor of Suzhou===

In 825, at age 53, Bai Juyi was given the position of Governor (Prefect) of Suzhou, situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and on the shores of Lake Tai. For the first two years, he enjoyed himself with feasts and picnic outings, but after a couple years he became ill and was forced into a period of retirement.

===Later career===
After his time as Prefect of Hangzhou (822-824) and then Suzhou (825-827), Bai Juyi returned to the capital. He then served in various official posts in the capital, and then again as prefect/governor, this time in Henan, the province in which Luoyang was located. It was in Henan that his first son was born, though only to die prematurely the next year. In 831 Yuan Zhen died. For the next thirteen years, Bai Juyi continued to hold various nominal posts but actually lived in retirement.

===Retirement===

In 832, Bai Juyi repaired an unused part of the Xiangshan Monastery, at Longmen, about 7.5 miles south of Luoyang. Bai Juyi moved to this location, and began to refer to himself as the &quot;Hermit of Xiangshan&quot;. This area, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is famous for its tens of thousands of statues of Buddha and his disciples carved out of the rock. In 839, he experienced a paralytic attack, losing the use of his left leg, and became a bedridden invalid for several months. After his partial recovery, he spent his final years arranging his Collected Works, which he presented to the main monasteries of those localities in which he had spent time.

===Death===

In 846, Bai Juyi died, leaving instructions for a simple burial in a grave at the monastery, with a plain style funeral, and to not have a posthumous title conferred upon him. He has a tomb monument in Longmen, situated on Xiangshan across the Yi River from the Longmen cave temples in the vicinity of Luoyang, Henan. It is a circular mound of earth high and in circumference, with a tall monument inscribed &quot;Bai Juyi&quot;.

==Works==
Bai Juyi has been known for his plain, direct, and easily comprehensible style of verse, as well as for his social and political criticism. Besides his surviving poems, several letters and essays are also extant.

He collected his writings in the anthology called the &quot;.

===History===
One of the most prolific of the Tang poets, Bai Juyi wrote over 2,800 poems, which he had copied and distributed to ensure their survival. They are notable for their relative accessibility: it is said that he would rewrite any part of a poem if one of his servants was unable to understand it. The accessibility of Bai Juyi&#x27;s poems made them extremely popular in his lifetime, in both China and Japan, and they continue to be read in these countries today. His writings are also popular in Korea and Vietnam.

===Famous poems===
One of Bai&#x27;s most famous poems is &quot;Chang hen ge&quot;&quot; (&quot;Song of Everlasting Sorrow&quot;), a long narrative poem that tells the story of the famous Tang dynasty concubine Yang Guifei and her relationship with Emperor Xuanzong of Tang.


Another of Bai&#x27;s famous poems is &quot;The Song of the Pipa Player&quot;. Like Du Fu, Bai had a strong sense of social responsibility and is well known for his satirical poems, such as &quot;The Elderly Charcoal Seller&quot;. Also he wrote about military conflicts during the Tang dynasty. Poems like &quot;Song of Everlasting Sorrow&quot; were examples of the peril in China during the An Lushan rebellion.

Bai Juyi also wrote intensely romantic poems to fellow officials with whom he studied and traveled. These speak of sharing wine, sleeping together, and viewing the Moon and mountains. One friend, Yu Shunzhi, sent Bai a bolt of cloth as a gift from a far-off posting, and Bai Juyi debated on how best to use the precious material:
Bai&#x27;s works were also highly renowned in Japan, and many of his poems were quoted and referenced in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; by Murasaki Shikibu. Zeami Motokiyo also quoted from Bai, in his Noh plays, and even wrote one, Haku Rakuten, about the Japanese god of poetry repelling the Chinese poet from Japan, in opposition to Bai&#x27;s (perceived) challenge to the country&#x27;s poetic autonomy.

===Poetic forms===
Bai Juyi was known for his interest in the old &quot;yuefu&quot; form of poetry, which was a typical form of Han poetry, namely folk ballad verses, collected or written by the Music Bureau. These were often a form of social protest. And, in fact, writing poetry to promote social progress was explicitly one of his objectives. He is also known for his well-written poems in the regulated verse style.

===Art criticism===
Bai was a poet of the middle Tang dynasty. It was a period after the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang Empire was in rebuilding and recovery. As a government official and a litterateur, Bai observed the court music performance that was seriously affected by Xiyu (西域, Western regions), and he made some articles with indignation to criticize that phenomenon. As an informal leader of a group of poets who rejected the courtly style of the time and emphasized the didactic function of literature, Bai believing that every literary work should contain a fitting moral and a well-defined social purpose. That makes him not satisfied with cultural performance styles of Tang court.

For instance, in his work of &quot;Faqu ge&quot; (), translated as &quot;Model Music&quot;, is a poem regard to a kind of performing art, he made the following statement: &quot;All the faqu&#x27;s now are combined with songs from the barbarians; but the barbarian music sounds evil and disordered whereas Han music sounds harmonious!&quot; ()

Faqu is a kind of performing style of Yanyue, a part of court music performance. In this poem, Bai Juyi strongly criticized Tang Daqu, which was itself heavily influenced by some nonnative musical elements absent in the Han Daqu-the original form of Daqu. Tang culture was an amalgamation of the culture of the ethnic Han majority, the culture of the &quot;Western Region&quot; (), and Buddhism. The conflict between the mainstream Han culture and minority culture exposed after the An Lushan Rebellion. The alien culture was so popular and it had seriously threatened the status of Han culture.

Musical performances at the Tang court are of two types: seated performances () and standing performances (). Seated performances were conducted in smaller halls with a limited number of dancers, and emphasized refined artistry. Standing performances involves numerous dancers, and were usually performed in courtyards or squares intended for grand presentations.

Bai&#x27;s another poem, &quot;Libuji&quot; (), translated as &quot;Standing Section Players&quot;, reflected the phenomenon of &quot;decline in imperial court music&quot;. In this poem, Bai mercilessly pointed out that music style of both seated performances and standing performances were deeply influenced by foreign culture.

Seated performances are more elegant than standing performances. Players in the Seating Section were the most qualified performers, while the performing level of the players in the Standing Section were a bit poor (). In Bai Juyi&#x27;s time, those two performances were full of foreign music, the Yayue (, literally: &quot;elegant music&quot;) was no longer be performed in those two sections. The Yayue music was only performed by the players who were eliminated from those two sections (). This poem shows the culture changing in the middle Tang dynasty and the decline of Yayue, a form of classical music and dance performed at the royal court and temples

In those two poems of Bai reflected the situation of political and culture in the middle Tang dynasty after the An Lushan Rebellion, and he was concerned that the popularity of foreign music could lead the Tang society into chaos.

The pipa in the poems of Bai Juyi represents the expression of love, the action of communicating, and especially the poet&#x27;s feelings on listening to music.

== Appraisal ==
Bai Juyi is considered one of the greatest Chinese poets, but even during the ninth century, sharp divide in critical opinions of his poetry already existed. While some poets like Pi Rixiu only had the highest praise for Bai Juyi, others were hostile, like Sikong Tu () who described Bai as &quot;overbearing in force, yet feeble in energy (&quot;qi&quot;), like domineering merchants in the market place.&quot; Bai&#x27;s poetry was immensely popular in his own lifetime, but his popularity, his use of vernacular, the sensual delicacy of some of his poetry, led to criticism of him being &quot;common&quot; or &quot;vulgar&quot;. In a tomb inscription for Li Kan (), a critic of Bai, poet Du Mu wrote, couched in the words of Li Kan: &quot;...It has bothered me that ever since the Yuanhe Reign we have had poems by Bai Juyi and Yuan Zhen whose sensual delicacy has defied the norms. Excepting gentlemen of mature strength and classical decorum, many have been ruined by them. They have circulated among the common people and been inscribed on walls; mothers and fathers teach them to sons and daughters orally, through winter&#x27;s cold and summer&#x27;s heat their lascivious phrases and overly familiar words have entered people&#x27;s flesh and bone and cannot be gotten out. I have no position and cannot use the law to bring this under control.&quot;

Bai was also criticized for his &quot;carelessness and repetitiveness&quot;, especially his later works. He was nevertheless placed by Tang poet Zhang Wei () in his Schematic of Masters and Followers Among the Poets () at the head of his first category: &quot;extensive and grand civilizing power&quot;.

=== Modern assessment ===
Burton Watson says of Bai Juyi: &quot;he worked to develop a style that was simple and easy to understand, and posterity has requited his efforts by making him one of the most well-loved and widely read of all Chinese poets, both in his native land and in the other countries of the East that participate in the appreciation of Chinese culture. He is also, thanks to the translations and biographical studies by Arthur Waley, one of the most accessible to English readers&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Bai Juyi is one of the main characters of the 2017 Chinese fantasy film &quot;Legend of the Demon Cat&quot;, where he is portrayed by Huang Xuan. It the movie, the poet is solving a murder mystery and struggles to finish his famous poem, &quot;Song of Everlasting Regret.&quot;

The American poet, Allen Ginsberg, wrote &quot;Reading Bai Juyi&quot; during his 1984 trip to China. The poem was written in Shanghai over the course of one day and the final section is a &quot;transformation&quot; (Ginsberg&#x27;s description) of a poem by Bai.

<doc id="420485" wikidata="Q4973067" url="?curid=420485" title="Brodmann area 23">
<text>Brodmann area 23 (BA23) is a region in the brain that lies inside the posterior cingulate cortex. It lies between Brodmann area 30 and Brodmann area 31 and is located on the medial wall of the cingulate gyrus between the callosal sulcus and the cingulate sulcus.

==Human==
This area is also known as ventral posterior cingulate area 23. It is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined cingulate region of cerebral cortex. In the human it occupies most of the posterior cingulate gyrus adjacent to the corpus callosum. At the caudal extreme it is bounded approximately by the parieto-occipital sulcus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded dorsally by the dorsal posterior cingulate area 31, rostrally by the ventral anterior cingulate area 24, and ventrorostrally in its caudal half by the retrosplenial region (Brodmann-1909).

==Guenon==
Brodmann area 23 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. Brodmann regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the combined ventral posterior cingulate area 23 and dorsal posterior cingulate Brodmann area 31 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive Features (Brodmann-1905): the cortex is relatively thin; smaller cells predominate; the cell density of the multiform layer (VI) is great, producing a distinct boundary with the subcortical white matter; the internal granular layer (IV) is rather well developed; the internal pyramidal layer (V) contains a dense population of round, medium-sized ganglion cells concentrated at the border with layer IV; layers V and VI are narrow with a distinct mutual boundary.

== Macaque ==
In the macaque the researchers Bonin and Bailey describe an area they term LC which is in agreement with Brodmann area 23. The LC area
: &quot;covers the posterior part of the cingulate gyrus and extends into the cingulate sulcus where, on the inferior wall, it is continuous with the frontal cortex FDL&quot;.

==Subdivisions==
The area has been subdivided further: In the macaque (Macaca fascicularis) the following subdivisions have been suggested:

* 23i (internal)
* 23e (external)
* 23v (ventral), the most caudalventral (inferior) portion and with most highly developed layer IV.

Another suggestion is for macaque (Macaca mulatta)

* 23a, adjacent to the callosal sulcus thus closest to Brodmann area 30.
* 23b
* 23c

Further division of 23b is.

* pv23b, posteroventral part for 23b, main thalamic projections from anterior nuclei.
* d23b, dorsal part of 23b, weak connections from the anterior nuclei.

<text>Watkin&#x27;s Tower was a partially completed iron lattice tower in Wembley Park, Middlesex, England. Its construction was an ambitious project to create a -high visitor attraction in Wembley Park to the north of the city, led by the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin. Marketed as the &quot;Great Tower of London&quot;, it was designed to surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and it was part of Wembley Park&#x27;s emergence as a recreational place. The tower was never completed and it was demolished in 1907. The site of the tower is now occupied by the English national football ground, Wembley Stadium.

== Names ==
Numerous names and nicknames were given to the tower during its planning, construction and legacy. These include Watkin&#x27;s Tower, Watkin&#x27;s Folly, the Wembley Park Tower, the Wembley Tower, the Metropolitan Tower, and the London Stump.

== History ==

Sir Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was a British Member of Parliament and railway entrepreneur, noted for being chairman of nine different British railway companies. He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations. He began work on the construction of a channel tunnel under the English Channel, with the aim of connecting his lines to the railway network in France, and successfully opened the Great Central Main Line. Although his channel tunnel project failed in 1881, Watkin remained a driven innovator, inspired by grand schemes which could augment his railway empire.

Among his numerous railway executive appointments, Watkin was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), an expanding London transport company which was later to become the Metropolitan line of the present-day London Underground system. Watkin was keen to attract more passengers onto his trains and was aggressively extending his railway into Buckinghamshire. He also considered transporting Londoners out into the countryside as a business opportunity and needed a major attraction to lure the crowds out of the city and onto his trains. To this end, Watkin purchased a tract of land near a rural Middlesex hamlet called Wembley, adjacent to the route of the Metropolitan Railway, with the goal of building an amusement park laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens (the park land had previously been landscaped by Humphry Repton and known as Wembley Park in the 18th century), and cricket and football pitches. The crowning glory of Watkin&#x27;s amusement park was to be a soaring metal tower which would be centrepiece of the pleasure park and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station.

The paying public was to gain access to Wembley Park and its tower by train, arriving at the new Wembley Park station which the Metropolitan Railway constructed specially for the attraction, incorporating additional platforms to handle the large crowds which Watkin confidently anticipated would flock to the park. The station opened in 1893–4.
=== Design and construction ===

Inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Watkin invited Gustave Eiffel himself to design the tower, but the Frenchman declined – replying that if he designed the tower, the French people &quot;would not think me so good a Frenchman as I hope I am.&quot;

An architectural design competition was held in 1890, and a total of 68 designs were submitted. Some of the more exotic proposals included a £1m tower inspired by the Leaning Tower of Pisa; a structure with &quot;a captive parachute to hold four persons&quot;; and a tower with a spiral railway climbing its exterior. One design included a 1/12-scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, envisioned as a &quot;colony of aerial vegetarians, who would grow their own food in hanging gardens&quot;.

The winning entry, number 37, was submitted by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn of London. They proposed an eight-legged metal tower – taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was at the time. It was to have two observation decks – each with restaurants, theatres, dancing rooms and exhibitions – winter gardens, Victorian Turkish baths and a 90-bedroom hotel. The top of the tower, reached by a system of lifts, was to provide a fresh-air sanatorium and an astronomical observatory, taking advantage of the clearer air offered by the altitude. The entire structure was to be illuminated by electric light.

Watkin formed a company to manage the project, the International Tower Construction Company and to oversee construction he appointed Benjamin Baker, a civil engineer who was involved in the design of the Forth Bridge and the Aswan Dam. After an unsuccessful appeal for public subscription, the company could only proceed with the project with its own funds; Watkin commissioned a redesign and the octagonal design was scaled back to a cheaper, four-legged design that bore much more resemblance to the Eiffel Tower. The foundations were laid in 1892 and construction work commenced in June 1893. At the same time, the surrounding park began to be laid out with a cricket pitch and a boating lake, in readiness for the first visitors.

=== Opening and demolition ===
Wembley Park officially opened to the public in May 1894, although construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately high. At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure&#x27;s foundations were unsteady — the reduction in the number of the tower&#x27;s legs, carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.

Over the next few years, the construction company experienced problems financing the project and went into voluntary liquidation in 1899. Work stopped, and the tower was never completed. Watkin died in 1901, and with halted construction, the &quot;unsafe&quot; site was closed to the public the following year. Between 1904 and 1907, the completed section of the tower was demolished using dynamite.

Despite the failure and destruction of Watkin&#x27;s star attraction, Wembley Park continued to flourish as a popular recreation venue, offering football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and, in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. By the end of World War I, over a hundred sports clubs used the Wembley facilities. In order to recoup its losses, the tower construction company turned to housebuilding and was re-incorporated as the Wembley Park Estate Company in 1906, laying out the Wembley suburb with exclusive homes and a golf course.

After the war, Wembley was selected as the site for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the park land was purchased from the Metropolitan Railway company. Among the pavilions and halls designed for the exhibition by John William Simpson, Maxwell Ayrton and Owen Williams was a grand sports arena, the 125,000-capacity British Empire Exhibition Stadium, later to be known as Wembley Stadium. It was built on the site of Watkin&#x27;s Tower, covering its foundations, and opened in 1923. It later became the home ground of the England national football team. When the original stadium was rebuilt in 2000–2003, the lowering of the level of the pitch resulted in the concrete foundations of the tower being rediscovered on the stadium site underneath the Twin Towers.

== Legacy ==

Watkin&#x27;s Folly was not the last attempt to build a notable British tower. In the north west of England, the Blackpool Tower (1894), New Brighton Tower (1896) and Morecambe Tower (1898) were also built, although only the Blackpool Tower remains standing.

Although Watkin&#x27;s tower has gone, Wembley Park continues to attract large crowds to sporting and musical events at Wembley Stadium, and it served as a venue for both the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The station built by the Metropolitan Railway remains in service to this day, providing a major transport link for Wembley crowds via the London Underground Metropolitan and Jubilee lines.

The story of Watkin&#x27;s Tower was recounted briefly in the 1973 BBC documentary by the then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, &quot;Metro-land&quot;. In the programme, Betjeman described Watkin&#x27;s vision of creating an engineering wonder in a little-known rural area north of London:
The programme also showed some of the unsuccessful designs for the tower. The script for &quot;Metro-land&quot; can be found in &quot;Betjeman&#x27;s England&quot;, a collection of writings by John Betjeman published in 2009.

The history of Watkin&#x27;s Tower is also showcased in the Brent Museum located in Willesden Green Library. The museum formerly allowed visitors to build a tower before it came tumbling down because of the vibrating floor, however, this has been removed since the renovation of the library in 2015.

<doc id="420489" wikidata="Q6036878" url="?curid=420489" title="Inquiry education">
<text>Inquiry education (sometimes known as the inquiry method) is a student-centered method of education focused on asking questions. Students are encouraged to ask questions which are meaningful to them, and which do not necessarily have easy answers; teachers are encouraged to avoid giving answers when this is possible, and in any case to avoid giving direct answers in favor of asking more questions. In this way it is similar in some respects to the Socratic method. The method was advocated by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner in their book &quot;Teaching as a Subversive Activity&quot;.

While inquiry-based education is a teaching method that has been connected with Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development and other constructivists like Jean Piaget, there is some evidence that this sort of approach was already used by the rabbis as early as antiquity (with the Passover Seder serving as an exemplar of such educational interventions).

==Overview==
The inquiry method is motivated by Postman and Weingartner&#x27;s recognition that good learners and sound reasoners center their attention and activity on the dynamic process of inquiry itself, not merely on the end product of static knowledge. They write that certain characteristics are common to all good learners (Postman and Weingartner, pp. 31–33), saying that all good learners have:
:* Self-confidence in their learning ability
:* Pleasure in problem solving
:* A keen sense of relevance
:* Reliance on their own judgment over other people&#x27;s or society&#x27;s
:* No fear of being wrong
:* No haste in answering
:* Flexibility in point of view
:* Respect for facts, and the ability to distinguish between fact and opinion
:* No need for final answers to all questions, and comfort in not knowing an answer to difficult questions rather than settling for a simplistic answer

In an attempt to instill students with these qualities and behaviors, a teacher adhering to the inquiry method in pedagogy must behave very differently from a traditional teacher. Postman and Weingartner suggest that inquiry teachers have the following characteristics (pp. 34–37):
:* They avoid telling students what they &quot;ought to know&quot;.
:* They talk to students mostly by questioning, and especially by asking divergent questions.
:* They do not accept short, simple answers to questions.
:* They encourage students to interact directly with one another, and avoid judging what is said in student interactions.
:* They do not summarize students&#x27; discussion.
:* They do not plan the exact direction of their lessons in advance, and allow it to develop in response to students&#x27; interests.
:* Their lessons pose problems to students.
:* They gauge their success by change in students&#x27; inquiry behaviors (with the above characteristics of &quot;good learners&quot; as a goal).

<text>Liu Zongyuan (; 77328 November 819) was a Chinese philosopher, poet, and politician who lived during the Tang dynasty. Liu was born in present-day Yongji, Shanxi. Along with Han Yu, he was a founder of the Classical Prose Movement. He has been traditionally classed as one of the &quot;Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song&quot;.

== Biography ==
Liu Zongyuan was born in 773. His courtesy name was Zihou ().

Liu Zongyuan&#x27;s civil service career was initially successful; however, in 805, he fell out of favour with the imperial government because of his association with a failed reformist movement. He was exiled first to Yongzhou, Hunan, and then to Liuzhou, Guangxi, where he eventually became the city Governor. A park and temple in Liuzhou is dedicated to his memory. His exile allowed his literary career to flourish: he produced poems, fables, reflective travelogues and essays synthesizing elements of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism.
He died in 819.

==Works==
Liu&#x27;s best-known travel pieces are the &quot;Eight Records of Excursions in Yongzhou&quot; (永州八記). Around 180 of his poems are extant, of which five were collected in the anthology &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;. Some of his works celebrate his freedom from office, while others mourn his banishment.

One of his most famous poems is &quot;Jiangxue&quot; (), translated into English as &quot;River Snow&quot; or &quot;Winter Snow&quot;. The poem has been an inspiration for many works of Chinese painting.

Liu Zongyuan wrote &quot;Fei Guoyu&quot; (, &quot;Argument against the Harangues of the Various States&quot;), a criticism of &quot;Guoyu&quot;. In response, Liu Zhang (劉 章, 1095–1177); Jiang Duanli (); and Yu Pan ( 1300), Yu Ji&#x27;s (虞 集, 1272–1348) younger brother, wrote texts titled &quot;Fei Fei Guoyu&quot; (; &quot;Argument against the Argument against the Harangues of the Various States&quot;) in opposition to Liu Zongyuan&#x27;s essay.

<doc id="420493" wikidata="Q311447" url="?curid=420493" title="Francisco de Miranda">
<text>Sebastián Francisco de Miranda y Rodríguez de Espinoza (28 March 1750 – 14 July 1816), commonly known as Francisco de Miranda (), was a Venezuelan military leader and revolutionary who fought in the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolution and the Spanish American wars of independence. He is regarded as a precursor of South America&#x27;s liberation from the Spanish Empire, and remains known as the &quot;First Universal Venezuelan&quot; and the &quot;Great Universal American&quot;.

Born in Caracas in the Viceroyalty of New Granada into a wealthy family, Miranda left to pursue an education in Madrid in 1771 and subsequently enlisted in the Spanish army.
In 1780, following Spain&#x27;s entry into the American Revolutionary War, he was sent to Cuba and fought the British at Pensacola. Accused of espionage and smuggling, he fled to the United States in 1783. Miranda returned to Europe in 1785 and travelled through the continent, gradually formulating his plans for Spanish American independence. From 1791 on, he took an active part in the French Revolution, serving as a general during the Battle of Valmy and the Flanders campaign. An associate of the Girondins, he became disillusioned by the Revolution and was forced to leave for Britain.

In 1806, Miranda launched an unsuccessful expedition to liberate Venezuela with volunteers from the United States. He returned to Caracas following the outbreak of the Venezuelan War of Independence in 1810 and was granted dictatorial powers after the establishment of the First Republic. In 1812, the republic collapsed and Miranda was forced to finalize an armistice with Spanish royalists. Other revolutionary leaders including Simón Bolívar considered his capitulation treasonous, and allowed his arrest by the Spanish authorities. He was taken to a prison in Cádiz, where he died four years later.

== Early life ==
Miranda was born in Caracas, Venezuela Province, in the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Granada, and baptized on 5 April 1750. His father, Sebastián de Miranda Ravelo, was a Spanish immigrant from the Canary Islands who had become a successful and wealthy merchant, and his mother, Francisca Antonia Rodríguez de Espinoza, was a wealthy Venezuelan.
Growing up, Miranda enjoyed a wealthy upbringing and attended the finest private schools. However, he was not necessarily a member of high society; his father faced some discrimination from rivals due to his Canarian roots.

== Education ==
Miranda&#x27;s father, Sebastián, always strove to improve the situation of the family, and in addition to accumulating wealth and attaining important positions, he ensured his children an advanced education. Miranda was first tutored by Jesuits, Jorge Lindo and Juan Santaella, before entering the Academy of Santa Rosa.

On 10 January 1762, Miranda began his studies at the Royal and Pontifical University of Caracas, where he studied Latin, the early grammar of Nebrija, and the Catechism of Ripalda for two years. Miranda completed this preliminary course in September 1764 and continued as a senior student. Between 1764 and 1766, Miranda studied the writings of Cicero and Virgil, grammar, history, religion, geography and arithmetic.

In June 1767, Miranda received his baccalaureate degree in the Humanities. It is unknown if Miranda received the title of Doctor, as the only evidence in favor of this title is his personal testimony stating he received it in 1767, at age 17.

===Issues of ethnic lineage===
Beginning in 1767, Miranda&#x27;s studies were disrupted in part due to his father&#x27;s rising prominence in Caracas society. In 1764, Sebastián de Miranda was appointed the captain of the local militia known as the Company of the White Canary Islanders by the governor, José Solano y Bote. Sebastián de Miranda directed his regiment for five years, but his new title and societal position bothered the white aristocracy (the Mantuanos). In retaliation, a competing faction formed a militia of its own and two local aristocrats, Don Juan Nicolas de Ponte and Don Martin Tovar Blanco, filed a complaint against Sebastián de Miranda.

Sebastián de Miranda requested and was granted honorary military discharge to avoid further antagonizing the local elite, and spent many years attempting to clear the family name and establish the &quot;purity&quot; of his family line. The need to establish the &quot;cleanliness&quot; of the family bloodline was important to maintain a place in society in Caracas, as it was what allowed the family to attend university, to marry in the church, and to attain government positions. In 1769, Sebastián produced a notarized genealogy to prove that his family had no African, Jewish or Muslim ancestors, according to the records in the National Archive of Venezuela. Miranda&#x27;s father obtained a blood cleanliness certificate, which should not be confounded with the blood nobility certificate.

In 1770, Sebastián proved his family&#x27;s rights through an official patent, signed by Charles III, which confirmed Sebastián&#x27;s title and societal standing. The court ruling, however, created an irreconcilable enmity with the aristocratic elite, who never forgot the conflict nor forgave the challenge, which inevitably influenced subsequent decisions by Miranda.

== Voyage to Spain (1771–1780) ==
After the court victory of his father, Miranda decided to pursue a new life in Spain, and, on 25 January 1771, Miranda left Caracas from the port of La Guaira for Cadiz, Spain, on a Swedish frigate, the Prince Frederick. Miranda landed at the Port of Cadiz on 1 March 1771, where he stayed for two weeks with a distant relative, Jose D&#x27;Anino, before leaving for Madrid.

=== In Madrid ===
On 28 March 1771, Miranda travelled to Madrid and took an interest in the libraries, architecture, and art that he found there. In Madrid, Miranda pursued his education, especially modern languages, as they would allow him to travel throughout Europe. He also sought to expand his knowledge of mathematics, history, and political science, as he aimed to serve the Spanish Crown as a military officer. During this time, he also pursued genealogical research of his family name to establish his ties to Europe and Christianity, which was especially important to him after his father&#x27;s struggles to legitimize their family line in Caracas.

It was in Madrid that Miranda began to build his personal library, which he added to as he traveled, collecting books, manuscripts and letters.

In January 1773, Miranda&#x27;s father transferred 85,000 reales vellon (silver coins), to help his son obtain the position of captain in the Princess&#x27; Regiment.

=== Early campaigns ===
During his first year as a captain, Miranda traveled with his regiment mainly in North Africa and the southern Spanish province of Andalusia. In December 1774, Spain declared war with Morocco, and Miranda experienced his first combat during the conflict.

While Miranda was assigned to guard the stations of an unwanted colonial presence in North Africa, he began to draw connections to the similar colonial presence in Spanish South America. His first military feat took place during the Siege of Melilla, held from 9 December 1774 to 19 March 1775, in which the Spanish forces managed to repel the Moroccan sultan, Mohammed ben Abdallah. However, despite the actions taken and danger faced, Miranda did not get an award or promotion and was assigned to the garrison of Cadiz.

Despite Miranda&#x27;s success in the military, he faced many disciplinary complaints, ranging from complaints that he spent too much time reading, to financial discrepancies, to the most serious disciplinary charges of violence and abuse of authority. One of Miranda&#x27;s well-known enemies was Colonel Juan Roca, who charged Miranda with the loss of company funds and brutalities against soldiers in Miranda&#x27;s regiment. The account of the dispute was sent to Inspector General O&#x27;Reilly and eventually reached King Charles III, who ordered Miranda to be transferred back to Cadiz.

== Missions in America (1781–1784) ==

=== The American Revolution ===
Spain became involved in the American Revolutionary War in order to expand their territories in Louisiana and Florida and to seek a recapture of Gibraltar. The Spanish Captain-General of Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez, in 1779 launched several offensives at Baton Rouge and Natchez, securing the way for the reconquest of Florida.

Spanish forces had begun mobilising to support their American allies, and Miranda was ordered to report to the Regiment of Aragon, which sailed from Cadiz in spring of 1780 under Victoriano de Navia&#x27;s command. Miranda reported to his chief, General Juan Manuel Cagigal y Monserrat, in Havana, Cuba. From their headquarters in Cuba, de Cagigal and Miranda participated in the Siege of Pensacola on 9 May 1781, and Miranda was awarded the temporary title of lieutenant colonel during this action. Miranda also contributed to the French success during the Battle of the Chesapeake when he helped the Comte de Grasse raise needed funds and supplies for the battle.

=== The Antilles ===
Miranda remained prominent while in Pensacola, and in August 1781, Cagigal secretly sent Miranda to Jamaica to arrange for the release of 900 prisoners-of-war, see to their immediate needs, and acquire auxiliary vessels for the Spanish Navy. Miranda was also asked to perform espionage work while staying with his British hosts. Miranda managed to perform a successful reconnaissance mission and also negotiated an agreement dated 18 November 1781, that regulated the exchange of Spanish prisoners. However, Miranda also entered into a deal with a local merchant, Philip Allwood. Miranda agreed to use the ships he had purchased during his stay in Jamaica to transport Allwood&#x27;s goods back to Spain to sell them. Upon his return, Miranda was charged with being a spy and smuggler of enemy goods. The order to send Miranda back to Spain pursuant to the judgment of 5 February 1782, of the Supreme Inquisition Council failed to be met due to various faults of form and substance in the administrative process that caused the order to be questioned and, in part, by Cagigal&#x27;s unconditional support of Miranda.

In 1782, Miranda participated in the Capture of the Bahamas and carried news of the island&#x27;s fall to Gálvez. Gálvez was angry that the Bahamas expedition had gone ahead without his permission, and he imprisoned Cagigal and had Miranda arrested. Miranda was later released, but this experience of Spanish officialdom may have been a factor in his subsequent conversion to the idea of independence for Spain&#x27;s American colonies. The efficiency demonstrated by Miranda in the Bahamas led Cagigal to recommend that Miranda be promoted to colonel under the command of the General Commander of the Spanish forces in Cuba, Bernardo de Gálvez, in St. Domingue, which the Spanish American authorities referred to Guarico. This should not be confused with the current Guárico State located today in central Venezuela.

At that time, the Spaniards were preparing a joint action with the French to invade Jamaica, which was a major British stronghold in the region, and Guárico was the ideal place to plan these operations, being close to the island and providing easy access for troops and commanders. Miranda was seen as the right person to plan operations because he had firsthand knowledge of the disposition of the troops and fortifications in Jamaica. However, the Royal Navy decisively defeated the French fleet at the Battle of the Saintes, so the invasion did not materialise and Miranda remained in Guarico.

=== Exile in the United States ===
With the failure of the invasion of Jamaica, priorities for the Spanish authorities changed, and the process of the Inquisition against Miranda gained momentum. The authorities sent Miranda to Havana to be arrested and sent to Spain. In February 1783, Minister of the Indies José de Gálvez sent the Captain General of Havana, Don Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga to arrest him. The information of his impending arrest reached Miranda in advance. Aware that he would not be given a fair trial in Spain, Miranda managed, with the help of Cajigal and the American James Seagrove, to slip away on a ship bound for the United States, arriving at New Bern, North Carolina on 10 July 1783. During his time in the United States, Miranda made a critical study of its military defenses, demonstrating extensive knowledge of the development of American conflict and circumstances.

While there, Miranda prepared and fixed a correspondence technique, used for the rest of his journey: he would meet people through the gift or loan of books, and examine the culture and customs of the places through which he passed in a methodical way. Passing through Charleston, Philadelphia, and Boston, he dealt with different characters in American society. In New York City he met the prominent and politically connected Livingston family. Apparently Miranda had a romantic relationship with Susan Livingston, daughter of Chancellor Livingston. Although Miranda wrote to her for years, he never saw her again after leaving New York.

During his time in the United States, Miranda met with many important people. He was personally acquainted with George Washington in Philadelphia. He also met General Henry Knox, Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. He also visited various institutions of the new nation that impressed him such as the Library of Newport and Princeton College.

==In Europe (1785–1790)==
=== Great Britain ===

On 15 December 1784, Miranda left the port of Boston in the merchant frigate &quot;Neptuno&quot; for London and arrived in England on 10 February 1785. While in London, Miranda was discreetly watched by the Spanish, who were suspicious of him. The reports highlight that Miranda had meetings with people suspected of conspiring against Spain and people considered among the eminent scholars of the time.

=== Prussia ===
The first secretary of the U.S. embassy, Colonel William Stephens Smith, whom Miranda knew from his stay in New York, came to England at around the same time. The US Ambassador was John Adams. Miranda visited them many times and continued the conversations about independence he had had with General Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Knox, among many other patriots in Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. Miranda and Smith decided to travel to Prussia to attend military exercises prepared by Prussian king, Frederick the Great. Bernardo del Campo, ambassador of Spain in the British capital since 1783, kept Miranda entertained with the idea that the king was close to resolve his situation. In fact, he was keeping Miranda under surveillance. When Miranda announced his sudden trip to continental Europe, he &quot;gladly&quot; gave Miranda a letter of introduction to the minister (ambassador) of Spain in Berlin who would be in charge of reporting frequently to Madrid. James Penman, an English businessman whom Miranda had befriended in Charleston, was responsible for keeping his papers while he traveled.

However, the Spanish ambassador had secretly intrigued to have Miranda arrested when he reached Calais, France, where he could be handed over to Spain. The plan fell apart because the Venezuelan and his friend went on 10 August 1785 to a Dutch port (Hellevoetsluis) instead.

=== Sweden ===
Between September and December 1787 Miranda travelled through Sweden, and he also visited Norway. Miranda arrived in Stockholm on 21 September 1787, from Saint Petersburg, and he stayed in the city until 24 September, returning on 3 October and then staying for almost a month until 1 November. He carried a letter of recommendation from empress Catherine the Great and was also shown support from the Russian ambassador in Stockholm Andrey Razumovsky. Through these connections he was invited to Stockholm Palace and an audience with king Gustav III on 17 October. However, the Spanish ambassador in Stockholm, Ignacio de Corral, demanded that Miranda should be extradited in December, at which time he had already left. He did not win support for his cause, but he later published excerpts from his journal about his experiences in Sweden. When visiting Gothenburg he had an affair with Christina Hall, the wife of one of the wealthiest merchants of Gothenburg John Hall. He also visited the family&#x27;s country retreat, Gunnebo House, on the outskirts of the city. 

Then Miranda made his way to Norway and arrived in Denmark in 1787. But in the Danish press he was accused of being a spy for the Empress of Russia. There is talk of extradition to Spain. But the King of Denmark assures him of his support. Francisco Miranda is bored at the Court of Denmark. He decides to go to Germany. Seeing the canal that connects the Baltic to the North Sea, he imagines the possibility of digging one in Panama that would join the Atlantic and the Pacific. He then traveled to Belgium and Switzerland and, on 24 May 1789, Francisco Miranda arrived in Paris.

=== Russia ===
Miranda then travelled throughout Europe, including present-day Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Greece and Italy, where he remained for over a year. After passing through Constantinople, Turkey, he visited the court of Catherine the Great, who was visiting Kiev and the Crimea. In Crimea, Miranda was received by the influential Prince Grigory Potemkin and later on, when the empress arrived, he was introduced to her. His sojourn in Russia took much longer because of the unexpected hospitality and attention received by the court and the empress. When she realized the dangers surrounding him, particularly the Inquisition order for his apprehension, she decided to protect him at all cost. She instructed all Russian ambassadors in Europe to assist him in any form and with great care, in order to protect him from the persecution in place. She extended him a Russian passport. He was also introduced to the king of Poland, Stanisław II August, with whom he exchanged many intellectual and political views on America and Europe. The king invited him to Poland. In Hungary, he stayed in the palace of Prince Nicholas Esterházy, who was sympathetic to his ideas, and wrote him a letter of recommendation to meet the musician Joseph Haydn.

Attempts to abduct Miranda by the diplomatic representatives of Spain failed as the Russian ambassador in London, Semyon Vorontsov, declared on 4 August 1789, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Francis Osborne, that Miranda, although a Spanish subject, was a member of the Russian diplomatic mission in London.

Miranda made use of the Spanish–British diplomatic row known as the Nootka Crisis in February 1790 to present to some British cabinet ministers his ideas about the independence of Spanish territories in America.

== Miranda and the French Revolution (1791–1798) ==


Starting in 1791, Miranda took an active part in the French Revolution as marechal de camp. In Paris, he befriended the Girondists Jacques Pierre Brissot and Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve, and he briefly served as a general in the section of the French Revolutionary Army commanded by Charles François Dumouriez, fighting in the 1792 campaign of Valmy.

The Army of the North (Armée de la Belgique) commanded by Miranda laid siege to Antwerp. When Miranda (and John Skey Eustace) failed to take Maastricht in February 1793 they were arrested on the orders of Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, Chief Prosecutor of the Revolution, and accused of conspiring against the republic with Charles François Dumouriez, the renegade general, who quickly defected to the enemy. Though indicted before the Revolutionary Tribunal – and under attack in Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot; – he and his lawyer Claude François Chauveau-Lagarde conducted his defence with such calm eloquence that he was declared innocent.

However, Marat denounced Chauveau-Lagarde as a liberator of the guilty. Even so, the campaign of Marat and the rest of the Jacobins against him did not weaken. He was arrested again in July 1793 and incarcerated in La Force prison, effectively one of the ante-chambers of death during the prevailing Reign of Terror. Appearing again before the tribunal, he accused the Committee of Public Safety of tyranny in disregarding his previous acquittal.

Miranda seems to have survived by a combination of good luck and political expediency: the revolutionary government simply could not agree on what to do with him. He remained in La Force even after the fall of Robespierre in July 1794, and was not finally released until January of the following year. The art theorist Quatremère de Quincy was among those who campaigned for his release during this time. Now convinced that the whole direction taken by the Revolution had been wrong, he started to conspire with the moderate royalists against the Directory, and was even named as the possible leader of a military coup. He was arrested and ordered out of the country, only to escape and go into hiding.

He reappeared after being given permission to remain in France, though that did not stop his involvement in yet another monarchist plot in September 1797. The police were ordered to arrest the &quot;Peruvian general&quot;, as the said general submerged himself yet again in the underground. With no more illusions about France or the Revolution, he left for England in a Danish boat, arriving in Dover in January 1798.

== Expeditions in South America (1804–1808) ==
=== Diplomatic negotiations, 1804–1805 ===
In 1804 with informal British help, Miranda presented a military plan to liberate the Captaincy General of Venezuela from Spanish rule. At the time, Britain was at war with Spain, an ally of Napoleon. Home Riggs Popham was commissioned by prime minister Pitt in 1805 to study the plans proposed by Miranda to the British Government, Popham then persuaded the authorities that, as the Spanish Colonies were discontented, it would be easier to promote a rising in Buenos Aires. Disappointed by this decision in November 1805, Miranda travelled to New York, where he rekindled his acquaintance with William S. Smith to organize an expedition to liberate Venezuela. Smith introduced him to merchant Samuel Ogden.

=== Venezuela and the Caribbean, 1806 ===
Miranda then went to Washington for private meetings with President Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison, who met with Miranda but did not involve themselves or their nation in his plans, which would have been a violation of the Neutrality Act of 1794. In New York Miranda privately began organizing a filibustering expedition to liberate Venezuela. Along with Colonel Smith he raised private funds, procured weapons, and recruited soldiers of fortune. Among the 200 volunteers who served under him in this revolt were Smith&#x27;s son William Steuben and David G. Burnet, who would later serve as interim president of the Republic of Texas after its secession from Mexico in 1836. Miranda hired a ship of 20 guns from Ogden, which he rechristened &quot;Leander&quot; in honor of his oldest son, and set sail to Venezuela on 2 February 1806.
In Jacmel, Haiti, Miranda acquired two other ships, the &quot;Bee&quot; and the &quot;Bacchus&quot;, and their crews. It was in Jacmel on 12 March that Miranda made and raised on the &quot;Leander&quot;, the first &quot;Venezuelan&quot; flag, which he had personally designed. On 28 April, a botched landing attempt in Ocumare de la Costa resulted in two Spanish &quot;guardacosta&quot;s, &quot;Argos&quot; and &quot;Celoso&quot;, capturing the &quot;Bacchus&quot; and the &quot;Bee&quot;. Sixty men were imprisoned and put on trial in Puerto Cabello accused of piracy. Ten were sentenced to death, hanged and dismembered in quarters. One of the victims was the printer Miles L. Hall, who for that reason has been considered as the first martyr of the printing press in Venezuela.

Miranda aboard of the &quot;Leander&quot; escaped, escorted by the packet ship HMS &quot;Lilly&quot; to the British islands of Grenada, Trinidad, and Barbados, where he met with Admiral Alexander Cochrane. As Spain was then at war with Britain, Cochrane and the governor of Trinidad Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet agreed to provide some support for a second attempt to invade Venezuela.

The &quot;Leander&quot; left Port of Spain on 24 July, together with HMS , HMS , HMS , and HMS &quot;Lilly&quot;, carrying General Miranda and some 220 officers and men. General Miranda decided to land in La Vela de Coro and the squadron anchored there on 1 August. The next day the frigate HMS joined them for three days. On 3 August 60 Trinidadian volunteers under the Count de Rouveray, 60 men under Colonel Dowie, and 30 seamen and marines from HMS &quot;Lilly&quot; under Lieutenant Beddingfelt landed. This force cleared the beach of Spanish forces and captured a battery of four 9- and 12-pounder guns; the attackers had four men severely wounded, all from HMS &quot;Lilly&quot;. Shortly thereafter, boats from HMS &quot;Bacchante&quot; landed American volunteers and seamen and marines. The Spanish retreated, which enabled this force to capture two forts mounting 14 guns.

General Miranda then marched on and captured Santa Ana de Coro, but found no support from the city residents. However, on 8 August a Spanish force of almost 2,000 men arrived. They captured a master of transport and 14 seamen who were getting water, unbeknownst to Lieutenant Donald Campbell. HMS &quot;Lilly&quot; landed 20 men on the morning of 10 August; this landing party killed a dozen Spaniards, but was able to rescue only one of the captive seamen. Colonel Downie and 50 men were sent, but the colonel judged the enemy force too strong and withdrew. When another 400 men came from Maracaibo, General Miranda realized that his force was too small to achieve anything further or to hold Coro for long. On 13 August, Miranda ordered his force to set sail again. HMS &quot;Lilly&quot; and her squadron then carried him and his men safely to Aruba.

In the aftermath of the failed expedition, the Marquis Casa de Irujo, Spanish minister in Washington, denounced the United States support given to General Miranda to invade Venezuela in violation of the Neutrality Act of 1794. The Municipal Council of Caracas indicted Miranda &quot;in absence&quot; charged him as pirate and traitor condemned to death penalty. The Colonel Smith and Ogden were indicted by a federal grand jury in New York for piracy and violating the Neutrality Act of 1794. Put on trial Colonel Smith claimed his orders came from President Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of State James Madison, who refused to appear in court. Both Colonel Smith and Ogden stood trial and were found not guilty.

=== Project to attack Venezuela, 1808 ===
Miranda spent the next year in Trinidad as host of governor Hyslop waiting for reinforcements that never came. On his return to London, he was met with better support for his plans from the British government after the failed invasions of Buenos Aires (1806–1807). In 1808 a large military force to attack Venezuela was assembled and placed under the command of Arthur Wellesley, but Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain suddenly transformed Spain into an ally of Britain, and the force instead went there to fight in the Peninsular War.

==The First Republic of Venezuela (1811–1812)==
=== Return to Venezuela ===
Venezuela achieved &quot;de facto&quot; independence on Maundy Thursday 19 April 1810, when the Supreme Junta of Caracas was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Junta sent a delegation to Great Britain to get British recognition and aid. This delegation, which included future Venezuelan notables Simón Bolívar and Andrés Bello, met with and persuaded Miranda to return to his native land. In 1811 a delegation from the Supreme Junta, among them Bolívar, and a crowd of common people enthusiastically received Miranda in La Guaira. In Caracas he agitated for the provisional government to declare independence from Spain under the rule of Joseph Bonaparte.

Miranda gathered around him a group of similarly minded individuals and helped establish an association, &quot;la Sociedad Patriotica&quot;, modeled on the political clubs of the French Revolution. By the end of the year, the Venezuelan provinces elected a congress to deal with the future of the country, and Miranda was chosen as the delegate from El Pao, Barcelona Province. On 5 July 1811, it formally declared Venezuelan independence and established a republic. The congress also adopted his &quot;tricolour&quot; as the Republic&#x27;s flag.

=== Decay of the First Republic of Venezuela ===

==== Crisis of the Republic ====
The following year Miranda and the young Republic&#x27;s fortunes turned. Republican forces failed to subdue areas of Venezuela (the provinces of Coro, Maracaibo and Guyana) that had remained royalist. In addition, Venezuela&#x27;s loss of the Spanish market for its main export, cocoa, caused an economic crisis, which mostly hurt the middle and lower classes, who lost enthusiasm for the Republic. Finally a powerful earthquake and its aftershocks hit the country, which caused large numbers of deaths and serious damage to buildings, mostly in republican areas.

It did not help that it hit on 26 March 1812, as services for Maundy Thursday were beginning. The Caracas Junta had been established on a Maundy Thursday, 19 April 1810 as well, so the earthquake fell on its second anniversary in the liturgical calendar. This was interpreted by many as a sign from Providence. It was explained by royalist authorities as divine punishment for the rebellion against the Spanish Crown.

The archbishop of Caracas, Narciso Coll y Prat, referred to the event as &quot;the terrifying but well-deserved earthquake&quot; that &quot;confirms in our days the prophecies revealed by God to men about the ancient impious and proud cities: Babylon, Jerusalem and the Tower of Babel&quot;. Many, including those in the Republican army and the majority of the clergy, began to secretly plot against the Republic or outright defect. Other provinces refused to send reinforcements to Caracas Province. Worse still, whole provinces began to switch sides. On 4 July, an uprising brought Barcelona over to the royalist side.

==== Miranda&#x27;s dictatorship ====
Neighboring Cumaná, now cut off from the Republican centre, refused to recognize Miranda&#x27;s dictatorial powers and his appointment of a commandant general. By the middle of the month, many of the outlying areas of Cumaná Province had also defected to the royalists. With these circumstances a Spanish marine frigate captain, Domingo Monteverde, operating out of Coro, was able to turn a small force under his command into a large army, as people joined him on his advance towards Valencia, leaving Miranda in charge of only a small area of central Venezuela. In these dire circumstances Miranda was given broad political powers by his government.

==== Defeat of the Republican army ====
Bolívar lost control of San Felipe Castle of Puerto Cabello along with its ammunition stores on 30 June 1812. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bolívar effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate in San Mateo. By mid-July Monteverde had taken Valencia and Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost. He started negotiations with royalists that finalised an armistice on 25 July 1812, signed in San Mateo. Then Colonel Bolívar and other revolutionary officers claimed his actions as treasonous.

=== Miranda&#x27;s arrest ===
Bolívar and others arrested Miranda and handed him over to the Spanish Royal Army in La Guaira port. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bolívar a passport, and Bolívar left for Curaçao on 27 August. Miranda went to the port of La Guaira intending to leave on a British ship before the royalists arrived, although under the armistice there was an amnesty for political offenses. Bolívar claimed afterwards that he wanted to shoot Miranda as a traitor but was restrained by the others; Bolívar&#x27;s reasoning was that, &quot;if Miranda believed the Spaniards would observe the treaty, he should have remained to keep them to their word; if he did not, he was a traitor to have sacrificed his army to it.&quot;

By handing over Miranda to the Spanish, Bolívar assured himself a passport from the Spanish authorities (passports which, nevertheless, had been guaranteed to all republicans who requested them by the terms of the armistice), which allowed him to leave Venezuela unmolested, and Miranda thought that the situation was hopeless.

== Last years (1813–1816) ==
Miranda never saw freedom again. His case was still being processed when he died in a prison cell at the Penal de las Cuatro Torres at the Arsenal de la Carraca, outside Cádiz, aged 66, on 14 July 1816. He was buried in a mass grave, making it impossible to identify his remains, so an empty tomb has been left for him in the National Pantheon of Venezuela.

== Miranda&#x27;s ideals ==
=== Political beliefs ===
Miranda has long been associated with the struggle of the Spanish colonies in Latin America for independence. He envisioned an independent empire consisting of all the territories that had been under Spanish and Portuguese rule, stretching from the Mississippi River to Cape Horn. This empire was to be under the leadership of a hereditary emperor called the &quot;Inca&quot;, in honor of the great Inca Empire, and would have a bicameral legislature. He conceived the name &quot;Colombia&quot; for this empire, after the explorer Christopher Columbus.

===Freemasonry===
Similarly to some others in the history of American Independence (George Washington, José de San Martín, Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins and Simón Bolívar), Miranda was a Freemason. In London he founded the lodge &quot;The Great American Reunion&quot;.

== Personal life ==
After fighting for Revolutionary France, Miranda finally made his home in London, where he had two children, Leandro (1803 – Paris, 1886) and Francisco (1806 – Cerinza, Colombia, 1831), with his housekeeper, Sarah Andrews, whom he later married. He had a friendship with the painter James Barry, the uncle of the surgeon James Barry; Miranda helped to keep the secret that the latter was biologically female. According to historian Linda de Pauw, &quot;Miranda was an ardent feminist, named women as his literary executors, and published an impassioned plea for female education a year before Mary Wollstonecraft published her famous &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women&quot;.&quot; Miranda&#x27;s library was sold at auction by R. H. Evans. The first part was sold on 22 July 1828 (and two following days) in London and a copy of the catalogue is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.132(12)).

<text>Anne de Xainctonge (21 November 1567 – 8 June 1621) was a French religious sister who founded of the Society of the Sisters of Saint Ursula of the Blessed Virgin. She was declared Venerable by the Roman Catholic Church in 1991.

==Life==
She was born in Dijon, the eldest child of Jean de Xainctonge, a politician, and his wife, Lady Marguerite Collard, both members of the nobility. Her father saw to it that she had a good education. Her upbringing was also very practical. She and her step-sister Nicole were entrusted with the care of the poultry-yard, cellar, and fruit-rooms.

At the age of seventeen, de Xainctonge made her appearance in high society with all the pomp of her position. She is described as vivacious and witty. When an acceptable suitor presented himself, she declined the proposal and her parents reluctantly let her have her way. The catechism lesson of a Jesuit, gave her the idea to assist with the instruction. She gathered those students having most difficulty and helped prepare them for the regular class. She also visited hospitals to care for and instruct the sick.

Near her house was a Jesuit school for boys which inspired her with the idea of educating girls. An uncloistered order of women, operating a free school for girls, was a new idea at that time, and de Xainctonge met with a great deal of resistance. In 1596 she left Dijon for Dole, a university town, at that time in Franche-Comté and under Spanish influence. There she found other young women interested in teaching women and girls. Rome had recently reasserted the cloister as the only approved form of religious life for women. Nonetheless, on 16 June 1606, Anne opened the first convent of what would later become the &quot;Society of the Sisters of Saint Ursula of the Blessed Virgin&quot;, in a house that had previously been a restaurant. In lieu of a religious habit, she and her companions adopted the simple black dress of the Spanish widows everywhere visible in the region of Dole, so as to render them inconspicuous in the streets on the rare occasions they had to leave the house.

The society spread rapidly in the east of France and in Switzerland. In addition to the original school, seven more were established by de Xainctonge during her lifetime. In 1619, a community was established in Porrentruy, Switzerland. Francis de Sales wrote to her expressing the wish that she make an establishment in his diocese, but she died in Dôle at the age of 53, before that could happen.

==Veneration==
Due to her work she was considered a candidate for beatification soon after her death, but the French Revolution and other wars of the period led to the destruction of many documents. Some sources add that de Xainctonge herself asked that her personal writings be burned after her death. The process of evaluating her spiritual writings, therefore, did not begin until 18 July 1998. Her cause was formally opened on 24 November 1900, and on 14 May 1991, John Paul II declared the heroic virtues of Anne de Xainctonge.

<text>A frontage road (also known as an access road, outer road, service road, feeder road, or parallel road) is a local road running parallel to a higher-speed, limited-access road. A frontage road is often used to provide access to private driveways, shops, houses, industries or farms. Where parallel high-speed roads are provided as part of a major highway, these are also known as local lanes. Sometimes a similar arrangement is used for city roads; for example, the collector portion of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts, is known as a carriage road.

== Overview ==


Frontage roads provide access to homes and businesses which would otherwise be cut off by a limited-access road and connect these locations with roads which have direct access to the main roadway. Frontage roads give indirect access to abutting property along a freeway, either preventing the commercial disruption of an urban area that the freeway traverses or allowing commercial development of abutting property. At times, they add to the cost of building an expressway due to costs of land and the costs of paving and maintenance.

However, the benefits of developing nearby real estate can more than offset the cost of building the frontage roads. Furthermore, a frontage road may be a part of an older highway, so the expense of building a frontage road may be slight. And finally, the cost to purchase access rights from adjacent property may exceed the costs to build frontage roads. Conversely, the existence of a frontage road can increase traffic on the main road and be a catalyst for development; hence there is sometimes an explicit decision made to not build a frontage road.

A frontage lane is a paved path that is used for the transportation and travel from one street to another. The difference is that typically a frontage road will follow along the side of a highway, whereas a frontage lane is a short connection between two different roads. Frontage lanes, closely related to a frontage road, are common in metropolitan areas and in small rural towns. Frontage lanes are technically not classified as roads due to their purpose as a bridge from one road to another, and due to the architectural standards that they are not as wide as a standard road, or used as commonly as a standard road, street, or avenue.

A backage road is a similar concept to a frontage road, but lies on the back side of the land parcels that abut the controlled access&#x27;s right of way. Like the frontage road, it serves mainly to provide access to those parcels as an alternative to a frontage road. Regardless of which direction the businesses face, the difference is that backage roads will sandwiched between businesses and be separated from the freeway, whereas frontage roads will be right beside a freeway.

Some make a distinction between frontage roads and parallel roads. Frontage roads may more commonly refer to the one-way roads alongside a freeway, whereas parallel roads more commonly refer to the two-way roads running alongside a freeway.

== Advantages ==

There are several advantages to using frontage roads. One advantage is to separate local traffic from through traffic. When frontage roads are lacking in an urban area, the highway is used as a local road, reducing speeds and increasing congestion.
Another advantage occurs when the highway is closed or just obstructed. This pushes traffic off the highway. Where an urban area has frontage roads, the traffic can easily bypass the obstruction or closure on the frontage road. Where an urban area has no frontage road, traffic is diverted onto and congests local roads, since there is no formal (frontage road) alternative.

== Disadvantages ==
There are also some disadvantages to using frontage roads. When frontage roads are used without controlling the access to the primary road, at every intersection where an intersecting road runs across the primary, the number of conflict points increases one fold for each frontage road, since each frontage road is itself another intersection. A highway with frontage roads can be difficult for pedestrians to cross, for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to when neither the primary road nor the crossing is elevated, or gaps in traffic are few and the intervals between those gaps is long. Such examples include:

* US 190 in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana;
* LA 1 in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana;
* Palatine Road in Cook County, Illinois;
* The northeast edge of Spur 503 in Denison, Texas;
* The Southeast edge of U.S. Route 69 in McAlester, Oklahoma.

A complex example is US 77/Commerce () in Ardmore, Oklahoma, particularly at the Grand Avenue intersection. Right turns from the central carriageways are not allowed; a slip ramp must be taken to the two-way frontage road, where the turning traffic must yield to the through traffic. Only then can a vehicle make a right turn from the signal on the frontage road.

Furthermore, frontage roads can increase urban sprawl. Land along highways is made open for development, allowing shopping centers and other buildings to sprawl.

Cost can also be a disadvantage, as building a highway with frontage roads can be more expensive than building a highway alone.

==Local–express lane system==
A different alternative to the concept of frontage roads in urban freeways is the local–express system, which is designed to handle closely spaced interchange ramps without disrupting through traffic. Unlike frontage roads, the local lanes are typically high-speed fully controlled-access lanes, conforming to freeway requirements. These local lanes will run along the outside of the inner express lanes.

The outer lanes may also be known as a collector/distributor road where slip ramps provide access to and from the inner mainline lanes. This distinction is usually made when the outer lanes are only present by an interchange and not the full length of the highway.

For even more capacity, frontage roads may feed into and from freeway local lanes although this is less common.

== Examples ==

===Argentina===
In Argentina, especially around Buenos Aires, frontage roads known as colectoras can be found next to freeways. Examples include Avenida General Paz, Ruta 8, and Ruta 9 coming into Buenos Aires.

=== Canada ===

Ontario:

A freeway with a significant remaining network of service roads is the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW). However, most of the slip ramps between St. Catharines and Mississauga were removed during major reconstruction in the 1970s and 1990s. Service roads are no longer able to directly access the QEW; they have been rerouted to intersections with other major roads which have interchanges with the QEW. Nonetheless, the service roads are positioned too close to the QEW to easily widen the freeway unless all the private properties along the service road are bought out. This would be unlikely in the current political environment.

The only remaining slip ramps connecting to service roads are on the QEW running through St. Catharines. These dangerous low-standard ramps (due to lack of acceleration/deceleration lanes) are due to be replaced in a planned extensive reconstruction of the QEW that is currently underway. Similar service roads and slip ramps exist along Highway 401 through Oshawa, but like through St. Catharines, these are also in the process of being replaced with modern ramps.

Highway 427 had its service roads replaced with a collector-express system in the 1970s. However, it has several RIRO access onramps and offramps to serve residential traffic in addition to its standard parclo interchanges with major arterials.

A short section of Highway 400 has the service roads of Davis Road (southbound) and Wist Road (northbound) from South Canal Bank Road to Canal Road in King Township and Bradford West Gwillimbury. There is a RIRO interchange to the service roads, signed as to Canal Road, to access the farms of the Holland Marsh and the town of Bradford West Gwillimbury.

Although not considered a service road, Lake Shore Boulevard in downtown Toronto has several slip ramps that weave in and out of the parallel Gardiner Expressway, in a similar fashion as a service road.

List of service roads on the QEW:

* series of broken sections from Cawthra Road in Mississauga to the Garden City Skyway in St. Catharines

List of service roads on ON-400:

* Davis Road (southbound) and Wist Road (northbound), King and Bradford West Gwillimbury

List of service roads on ON-403:

* North Service Road at QEW/407 junction to Waterdown Rd, Burlington
* Service Road at Guelph Line, Burlington

List of RIRO intersections on ON-427:

* Gibbs Road onto Northbound 427
* Eva Road onto/off Southbound 427
* Holiday Drive onto/off Southbound 427
* Eringate Drive onto/off Southbound 427
* Valhalla Inn Road onto Northbound 427

Quebec:
Many autoroutes in the Montreal area (including the A-40, A-520, A-13, A-15 and A-25) maintain networks of frontage roads along at least some of their lengths as they pass through urban/developing areas.

British Columbia:
Bi-directional frontage roads exist both on the North and South sides of the Trans-Canada highway through Abbotsford in the Fraser Valley.

=== India ===

In India, frontage roads or Service lanes (sometimes called नल्ला &quot;Nullah&quot; in Hindi) exist on most high density dual carriageway roads and dual carriageway highways. On Access controlled Expressways like the Yamuna Expressway, the frontage roads remain separate from the main carriageway throughout the road&#x27;s length. Retrofitted and previously non-access controlled roads, such as most National Highways, only have service lanes on stretches where fly-overs (overpasses) are built over junctions or through towns.

===Mexico===
In Guadalajara, the López Mateos, Vallarta and Mariano Otero avenues (the latter in the stretch between López Mateos to Niños Héroes) are two-lane avenues surrounded by two one-way frontage roads. Lázaro Cárdenas Expressway is similar, but with three lanes in both the central road and the frontage roads. Because these frontage roads are considered as part of the avenue itself, the central road is known locally as the &quot;central lanes&quot;, whereas the frontage roads are known as &quot;lateral lanes&quot;. Turns are always forbidden in the central lanes; drivers wishing to make a turn must leave the central lanes and make the turn from the lateral lanes.

===Netherlands===
Frontage roads are common in the Netherlands and detailed in the Dutch national design manual for bicycle traffic as per pages 121 and 127 where they are referred to as parallel roads. In the Netherlands, engineers have used frontage roads to benefit cyclists as well as automobiles. Because frontage roads only carry local traffic, the speed on these roads is low (their speed limit is 30 km/h), making them an ideal environment for bicyclists. Because the speed and volume is so low, no additional treatments are needed to make a service road a safe bike facility. In the Netherlands, service roads are often linked together with bike paths to help create a comprehensive bicycle route, with the bike path links serving as barriers to through motor traffic. Since service roads serve a dual purpose, they are an inexpensive way to create routes in cycling network, compared to cycletracks or stand-alone bike paths. Extensive amounts of information on frontage roads can be found on Northeastern&#x27;s webpage.

=== Mainland China ===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China mainland, roads running next to expressways, taking outgoing traffic and feeding incoming traffic, are referred to as service roads () or auxiliary roads (). Where expressways cross larger urban areas, such frontage roads may run next to the expressway itself. Much of the Beijing portion of the Jingkai Expressway, for example, has, in fact, China National Highway 106 acting as a split-direction frontage road. Many newer urban highways are entirely elevated, with parallel access roads running beneath the entire length.

=== Philippines ===
==== Expressways ====
The North Luzon Expressway maintains two-way service roads that run along both sides of the expressway within Metro Manila limits, which extend from exits and merge into local roads.

To the south, the South Luzon Expressway&#x27;s Metro Manila Skyway and Pres. Sergio Osmeña Sr. Highway segments (both are apparently local and express roads) has two two-way service roads and the PNR running alongside the road. The tracks are between the East Service Road and the highway, giving access to train stations from Pasay Road railway station to Bicutan railway station. The service roads begin at Gil Puyat Avenue up until the Filinvest City exit.

==== Other roads ====
Other major roads in the country with two-way service roads include Roxas Boulevard, with service roads catering to local establishments along the thoroughfare. The East Service Road runs from Kalaw Avenue in Ermita, Manila to C. Rivera Street in Pasay while the shorter West Service Road runs from Vicente Sotto Street to Gil Puyat Avenue within Bay City.

Ortigas Avenue in Greenhills, San Juan contains two service roads. The eastbound one-way service roads from Roosevelt Street to Wilson Street, and from Wilson Street to Connecticut Street provide access to establishments along the road while serving as bus stops for bus routes along Ortigas Avenue. A westbound one-way service road from Connecticut Street to Club Filipino Avenue is primarily a local-express road setup which distributes traffic to the Greenhills Shopping Center and pass-through traffic along Ortigas Avenue.

Quezon Avenue in Quezon City runs an eastbound one-way service road from West Avenue and East Avenue to its intersection with EDSA.

=== Hong Kong ===
Frontage roads exist both in city and along major expressways between new towns. Gloucester Road has frontage road running parallel of it from east to west. Cheung Tung Road serves as the frontage road for North Lantau Highway, Hiram&#x27;s Highway for New Hiram&#x27;s Highway, and Tai Wo Service Road West and Tai Wo Service Road East for Fanling Highway. Castle Peak Road serves the purpose as a frontage road of Tuen Mun Road to some extent.

=== United States ===
Alaska

Though Alaska has very few roads that are built to freeway standard, a couple of the highways that are do have frontage roads; notably along the Seward Highway (Alaska Route 1) with Homer Drive running south (from Tudor Road to Dimond Boulevard) and Brayton Drive running north (from DeArmoun Road to Tudor Road); and the Minnesota Drive Expressway (from West 100th Ave to Dimond Boulevard) in South Anchorage. Also, the George Parks Highway (Alaska Route 3) has two-way frontage roads running along it from the Trunk Road exit to the Seward Meridian Parkway exit (Fireweed Road on the south side and Blue Lupine Drive on the north side) in Wasilla.

====Arizona====
Frontage roads are not very common in Arizona but do exist along certain freeways.

In metropolitan Phoenix, the state&#x27;s first freeway, Interstate 17 has a frontage road (Black Canyon Highway); some sections of the frontage road was reduced to a single lane in the 1990s when I-17 was widened. Several freeways overbuilt existing arterials, which were converted to frontage roads: Price Road (Tempe), Pima Road (Scottsdale) and Beardsley Road (north Phoenix) on the Loop 101, as well as 59th Avenue on the Loop 202 Ed Pastor (South Mountain) Freeway. In Tucson, I-10 has a two-lane, one-way frontage road, and in between Casa Grande and Tucson, a two-lane, two-way frontage road.

====California====
The East Shore Freeway, a wrong-way concurrency of 80 and 580 in Berkeley and Emeryville, is served by a frontage which retains the name of the previous road that ran through the corridor: the Eastshore Highway. It is also served by another frontage on the other side of the freeway: West Frontage Road.

Interstate 210 in California near Pasadena and Arcadia has frontage roads which include Corson Street in Pasadena (parallel to I-210 West) and Maple Street (parallel to I-210 East) in Pasadena, while Central Avenue (parallel to I-210 West) and Evergreen Avenue (parallel to I-210 East) are in Arcadia.

In Orange County, frontage roads exist on sections of these four highways:
* Interstate 5 (Santa Ana Freeway) between Anaheim Boulevard and State College Boulevard in Anaheim. The northbound frontage road is Anaheim Way and the southbound frontage road is Manchester Avenue.
* California State Highway 55 (Costa Mesa Freeway) from its southern terminus north of 19th Street up to Bristol Street in Costa Mesa Both the northbound and southbound frontage roads are signed as Newport Boulevard.
* California State Highway 73 (Corona del Mar Freeway) from Red Hill Avenue to Jamboree Road in Newport Beach. Both the northbound and southbound frontage roads are signed as Bristol Street.
*The expressway section of Jamboree Road from Edinger Avenue to the start of the SR 261 Toll Road in Irvine.

====Connecticut====
A short frontage road exists on Interstate 95 in New London just west of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge and the interchange with Connecticut Route 32, serving two shopping plazas and nearby suburbs. U.S. Route 1 also connects to the Interstate via this frontage road, at the western end of the concurrency of the two routes along the bridge. Other frontage roads existing along I-95 at the New Haven/East Haven city line, and along Interstate 91 north of Hartford.

====Illinois====
Frontage roads are common in Chicago, where they usually have the name of the street in its place had before the adjacent expressway was constructed. Parts of the Edens Expressway, the Dan Ryan Expressway, the Eisenhower Expressway, and the Kennedy Expressway use frontage roads. In addition, the stretches of Interstate 290 and the Elgin–O&#x27;Hare Expressway in Schaumburg have frontage roads.

====Indiana====
Interstate 69 between Indianapolis and Bloomington was built directly over State Road 37 between the two cities. Along that segment, frontage roads were constructed to provide local access. The old State Road 37 roadway makes up some of the I-69 frontage roads between Bloomington and Martinsville.

====Massachusetts====
Service roads are relatively uncommon in much of New England, and in Boston in particular, largely due to resistance to expressway construction, which necessitated scaled-back rights of way. Still, some unique examples of the type exist in the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Surface Road, Cross street, and Atlantic Avenue in downtown Boston. As a result of the Big Dig, the carriageways of these streets were re-aligned to function as a two-way service road system through downtown Boston with the Rose Kennedy Greenway park system as their &#x27;median&#x27;, and the expressway underground. In this special case of a service road, the subterranean I-93 Central Artery expressway is not visible from the surface, but accessible through access ramps into the tunnel system. Just south of downtown, I-93 also includes a short section at-grade service road between exits 16 in South Boston and the I-90 interchange south of Chinatown, in a more typical arrangement of the concept.

Typical service roads also exist along the eight-lane freeway section of Massachusetts Route 2 through Arlington and Belmont (two near northwestern suburbs of Boston) and United States Route 1 in Lynnfield.

In Fall River, from 1965 to 2023, Davol Street served as the frontage road for Massachusetts Route 79 between &quot;Broadway Extended&quot;, Anawan and Pocasset Streets, Central Street, and Interstate 195 in the south, to Brightman Street in the north. For most of this stretch, Davol Street is split, with the Western Fall River Expressway (Route 79) running between a one-way pair of northbound North Davol Street and southbound South Davol Street. Until its closure in 2011, the Brightman Street Bridge carried U.S. Route 6 and Route 138 between Somerset and Fall River. At the eastern approach to the bridge, US 6 and MA 138 connected to MA 79, Brightman Street, and both sides of Davol Street at a complex interchange (to and from MA 79)/intersection (to and from US 6/MA 138, Brightman Street, and both sides of Davol Street). North of this interchange/intersection, both sides of Davol Street become the exit ramp from MA 79 southbound and entrance ramp to MA 79 northbound. 

After the Veterans Memorial Bridge replaced the Brightman Street Bridge in 2011, this relocated US 6 and MA 138 onto a taller, expressway-like bridge with a large modified trumpet-style interchange with MA 79 and both sides of Davol Street. A new U-turn ramp from North Davol Street to South Davol Street and MA 79 southbound was added, along with a bike path along the bridge from Somerset and then south to Brightman Street. Brightman Street itself could only be accessed from North Davol Street; traffic from Brightman Street had to use local side streets to reach North Davol Street to access either direction of MA 79, US 6, and MA 138. 

In 2015 and 2016, the Fall River Viaduct carrying MA 79 to its terminus at MA 138 and I-195 was demolished. When reconstruction was complete in 2016, Routes 79 and 138 were merged onto one boulevard-style Davol Street roadway with signaled intersections (at Central Street, Anawan and Pocasset Streets, and a new complex intersection with connections to I-195, Millikan Boulevard, and Ponta Delgada Boulevard/Water Street) from a partially-reconstructed partial interchange just south of Brownell Street. 

By spring 2023, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) had closed and started to remove some of the Route 79 expressway between the partial interchange from just south of Brownell Street at the southern end and the Veterans Memorial Bridge interchange at the northern end. All Route 79 traffic has been directed onto both sides of the Davol Street frontage road south of the Veterans Memorial Bridge interchange. Part of the 2011 Veterans Memorial Bridge interchange was closed or modified as well, most notably the ramp from US 6 eastbound/MA 138 southbound on the bridge to MA 79 southbound and the aforementioned U-turn ramp from North Davol Street to South Davol Street and Route 79 southbound (a temporary U-turn to the south has been built in its place for use during the construction period). 

During re-construction of Davol Street as a boulevard, a temporary roadway will be built at-grade on the site of the former elevated expressway, with all traffic using it until the reconstructed halves of Davol Street are finished. Afterwards, the temporary roadway will be removed, with the land being slated for redevelopment, and all Route 79/138 traffic will return to North and South Davol Streets. By the completion of the project, the removal of the expressway will eliminate the frontage road status of North and South Davol Streets.

North and South Davol Streets carry US 6 from the Veterans Memorial Bridge (and before that, the Brightman Street Bridge) to President Avenue, where it turns east to cut through the city. 

Between the mid-1960s and 2023, the status of Route 138 between &quot;Broadway Extended&quot; and either bridge to Somerset has been up for debate. Signs dating back to, and possibly prior to, the construction of the Fall River Viaduct (demolished 2015-2016) indicate that this stretch of Davol Street carries Route 138. Most signs from the mid-1960s indicate that MA 138 joins Route 79 from its southern end and leaves it at the ramps to either bridge to Somerset. However, some signs along President Avenue (US 6) and South Davol Street (and formerly also near the pre-2015 site of the split of Davol Street into the one-way pair) indicated that Route 138 still used the one-way pair of North and South Davol Streets. The elimination of the Route 79 expressway largely will end this decades-long debate, as North and South Davol Streets will carry all traffic (US 6 and Routes 79 and 138) from Central Street in the south to the Veterans Memorial Bridge in the north, where the Davol Street halves will re-join and serve as the transition to a new, permanent &quot;southern end&quot; of the truncated Western Fall River Expressway.

====Michigan====
Frontage roads are also common in Metro Detroit, where they are usually referred to as &quot;service drives.&quot; As in Texas, they typically run one-way with frequent slip ramps to and from the limited-access roadway, with Texas U-turns at or near many intersections. Unlike Texas, there is usually little commercial development situated along the frontage road itself (see example); the road serves to provide access to the freeway from existing residential streets and commercial surface thoroughfares. Also unlike in many locales in urban Texas, where an exit ramp may actually precede the entrance ramp for the previous interchange to facilitate access to businesses situated directly on the frontage road (in effect, the two interchanges overlap along the frontage road), Michigan slip ramps to and from frontage roads are generally positioned as they normally would be in the absence of the frontage road. Motorists entering and exiting the freeway are not sharing the frontage road simultaneously to as large a degree, reducing weaving. Access to the frontage road between exits is provided by turnarounds and frequent bridging, generally every 1/2 mile, between exits.

Michigan left hand turns are also quite common at surface street-frontage road intersections, with dedicated turnaround lanes (similar to the Texas U-turn) built over the freeway on separate bridges approximately 100 meters from the main intersection and bridging.

With the exceptions of Interstate 275 and the freeway portion of M-53, every Metro Detroit freeway has a frontage road along it for at least a portion of its length. Several other freeways outside Metro Detroit use these as well.

There are two other cities in Michigan where frontage roads running more than one mile in length outside of Metro Detroit can be found. There are frontage roads along Interstate 496 and U.S. Route 127 in Greater Lansing and along Interstate 475 in Downtown Flint. Outside the cities, US-23 has them from Ann Arbor to Fenton, while US-127 has them from Leslie to Mason. New freeway construction in Michigan has not included frontage roads since the completion of Interstate 696, most of which was constructed along the rights of way of major surface arteries, in 1989. Michigan does not build frontage roads in rural areas.

====Missouri====
Missouri has built frontage roads, typically named &quot;Outer Roads&quot;, along Interstate 44 (when it was designated as US 66) between Springfield and Greater St. Louis and along US 67 (not all of it up to freeway standards) between Festus and Poplar Bluff. Outer roads are also found on Interstate 64 in West St. Louis County, Interstate 270 in North St. Louis County, and Missouri Highway 367 between I-270 and Lindbergh Blvd.

====Montana====
Along Interstate 15, most rural sections of the former US 91 are still in service as frontage roads between Lima and Butte, Butte and Helena, Helena and Great Falls, and from Great Falls north to Shelby.

Some former sections of US 10 in the west (Saint Regis to Butte along Interstate 90) and east (Billings to North Dakota along Interstate 94) also serve as frontage roads.

====New Jersey====

While service roads are somewhat uncommon on most New Jersey highways, they do exist. In northern New Jersey, Route 3 has several service roads throughout much of its length, due in part to the heavy commercial development in the area. Notably, commuters will often use these service roads to get ahead of regular traffic back ups, often causing accidents which lead to the shut down of said service roads, defeating their purpose. Frontage Roads are also used on Route 24 in Short Hills where Route 124 serves as a service road for about 2 miles. The Garden State Parkway also has a service road in Irvington for a distance.

====New Mexico====
====New York====
One-way service roads on either sides of highways are relatively common in New York City and the surrounding areas. Due to the high urban density, this design allows rapid access on and off the highway while also providing a viable alternate route in the case of accidents and traffic. In the borough of Queens, the Van Wyck Expressway has this system implemented for most of its length. On Long Island, the Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495), has one-way service roads on each side of the expressway for most of its length from the Queens–Midtown Tunnel to Riverhead.

Upstate, frontage roads are less common. New York State Route 104 has frontage roads along its limited access portions in Irondequoit and Webster, and the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86) in Horseheads has two short frontage roads (Brickyard Lane and Fairport Lane) during its elevated expressway portion. These stretches of service roads have signalized intersections with main roadways, as well as RIRO-style intersections with tertiary roadways and larger commercial properties.

====North and South Carolina====
Service roads can be found alongside interstate highways in North Carolina and South Carolina. Some of these roads have houses facing the highways which they parallel. They may also have highway service, as most of them are located near interchanges. Most service roads in the Carolinas do not have ramps leading to and from their respective highways; rather, as mentioned before, most are located near interchanges, which allows people to exit the highway and go around to the frontage road if needed. Those service roads are also commonly used as roads for farms and their products.

====Texas====
As of 2007, according to the state comptroller, Texas had built over of frontage roads. This was far more than any other state. The state government&#x27;s obsession with always building frontage roads alongside major highways is credited to chief highway engineer Dewitt Greer (1940–1968). He started building frontage roads as a measure to reduce right-of-way acquisition costs by ensuring access to new highways for affected landowners; otherwise, the state would have needed to pay them a higher price for cutting off access to their land. 

Most Texas freeways have service roads on both sides. In urban and suburban areas, the traffic typically travels one-way, in the direction of the adjacent freeway. Most other areas have two-way traffic, but as an area urbanizes, the frontage road is often converted to one-way traffic (2 lanes). In cases of freeway congestion or shutdown, the frontage road provides an instant detour, subject to delays at each stop sign or stoplight at cross streets.

Where two new Texas freeways meet, especially on the edge of major metropolitan areas, the state will often first build the junctions for the one-way frontage roads—that is, four at-grade intersections—followed by an overpass where one freeway crosses over another. This requires motorists who desire to switch freeways to exit to the adjacent frontage road, turn at an at-grade intersection onto the frontage road for the other freeway, and then merge into the other freeway. As traffic increases at the at-grade intersections, the state slowly adds direct ramps between freeways for the most in-demand traffic movements, thereby reducing such inconvenience for motorists.

Over 80% of Houston freeways have service roads, which locals typically call feeders. Many service roads in urban and suburban areas of Texas have the convenience of Texas U-turns, as a left lane curving under an overpass, allowing drivers to avoid stopping for traffic lights when making a U-turn.

Service roads are often built as part of a multi-phase plan to construct new limited-access highways. They initially serve as a highway with access to local business before the freeway is constructed years later. After the completion of the freeway, frontage roads serve as a major thoroughfare for local activity, such as with the Katy Freeway project (I-10) in Greater Houston. In several cases, a long-range plan has called for a future freeway, but the design has either changed or the project was canceled before completion.

Nicknames for frontage roads vary within the state of Texas. In Houston and East Texas, they are called feeders. Dallas and Fort Worth area residents call their frontage roads &quot;service roads&quot;, and &quot;access roads&quot; is the predominant term used in San Antonio. Most signs reference &quot;Frontage Road&quot; despite local regional vernacular (there are signs in Houston that use the term &quot;feeder&quot;).

In Houston, the free sections of Beltway 8, SH 249 and FM 1093, not part of the Sam Houston Tollway, Tomball Tollway, and Fort Bend Westpark Tollway (respectively) are composed of frontage roads.

In 2002, the Texas Department of Transportation proposed to discontinue building frontage roads on new freeways, citing studies that suggest frontage roads increase congestion. However, this proposal was widely ridiculed and criticized and was dropped later the same year.

The Stemmons Freeway in Dallas illustrates the practicability of the frontage road: the real estate developer John Stemmons offered free land to the Texas Highway commission in which to build a freeway (Interstate 35E) on the condition that the state build the freeway with frontage roads that would give access to undeveloped property that he owned along the freeway corridor. The state was able to reduce its costs (largely the cost of land acquisition) of building the freeway, and didn&#x27;t need to acquire and demolish developed property; the developer profited from development along the freeway. San Antonio developer Charles Martin Wender used the same tactic for his Westover Hills development, offering free land through the middle of his property for SH 151 as well as paying half the costs for the initial frontage road construction. Following Wender&#x27;s lead, several neighboring landowners also donated right-of-way for the route.

====Washington====
Frontage roads are found in Spokane along a segment of Interstate 90 between its interchange with SR 290 and the exit for East Appleway Boulevard. West of South Havana Street, the westbound frontage road is East Second Avenue and the eastbound frontage road is East Third Avenue. East of South Havana Street, the westbound frontage road is East Third Avenue and the eastbound frontage road is East Fourth Avenue.

<doc id="420505" wikidata="Q472824" url="?curid=420505" title="Harlow Curtice">
<text>Harlow Herbert Curtice (August 15, 1893 – November 3, 1962) was an American automotive industry executive who led General Motors (GM) from 1953 to 1958. As GM&#x27;s chief, he was selected as Man of the Year for 1955 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Curtice was born in Petrieville, Michigan. He joined General Motors at age 20, and rose through its AC Spark Plug division to head it by age 36, and made the division profitable during the Depression. Selected to head the Buick division of GM, he expanded its line and made it profitable in the 1930s.

In 1948, Curtice became executive vice president of GM, and succeeded to the presidency in 1953 when GM president Charles Wilson became Secretary of Defense. With Curtice as president, GM became immensely profitable, and became the first corporation to have $1 billion in profits in one year.

In 1958, Curtice retired just after his 65th birthday. The following year, he accidentally shot and killed a friend while duck hunting. He died in 1962 at age 69.

==Early life==
Curtice was born in Petrieville, Michigan, on August 15, 1893, the son of Marion Curtice and the former Mary Ellen Eckhart, and was raised in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, attending Eaton Rapids High School. During school vacations, he kept the books for his father, a commission merchant, and also worked in a woolen mill. He graduated from the Ferris Business College in 1914. After moving to Flint, Michigan, later in 1914, Curtice began his meteoric rise at GM. He started as a bookkeeper for GM&#x27;s AC Spark Plug Division. The 20-year-old, in his job interview by the company comptroller, told him that his ambition was to become comptroller himself within a year. He did so, becoming AC Spark Plug&#x27;s comptroller at just 21. Curtice went beyond the ledger, exploring the plant to find out what the figures meant in terms of men and equipment.

After a brief period of service as an Army enlisted man, Curtice resumed his career at AC Spark Plug, becoming assistant general manager in 1923 and president in 1929. While other product lines struggled with or were destroyed by the Depression, Curtice&#x27;s AC Spark Plug Division expanded and prospered.

==Executive==
GM&#x27;s Buick division was having great difficulties during the Depression (according to Curtice, production was at only 17% of 1926 levels). Curtice was put in charge, and quickly made a new organization for Buick, and marketed a new car called the Buick Master Six and Buick Standard Six. He also created a small network of dealers that would be exclusively Buick dealers. Curtice guided Buick through the war years and, by the time he was elevated to a GM vice presidency, he had made Buick the fourth best-selling car line.

During World War II, Buick produced aircraft engines with such efficiency that the Army considered making Curtice a general, but he declined. In 1946, GM president Charles Wilson offered him the position of executive vice president — to be Wilson&#x27;s right-hand man — but Curtice declined, stating that he wished to see Buicks rolling again off the assembly line before he left the division. In 1948, Wilson offered the position again to Curtice and this time he accepted.

Curtice had greater power as executive vice president than any previous holder of that position. He was in charge of all staff matters. In 1953, Wilson left after President Dwight Eisenhower appointed him Secretary of Defense. GM&#x27;s board of directors appointed Curtice to take Wilson&#x27;s place.

==President==
Curtice kept GM&#x27;s tradition of letting division heads be effectively autonomous. However, with GM&#x27;s Allison Division (aircraft motors) lagging in 1953, he stepped in personally to help run the division and to find money for a massive investment for a new line of engines that again made the division competitive with Pratt &amp; Whitney. In 1955, Eastern Airlines&#x27; Eddie Rickenbacker placed a large order for the new engines. In his first two years as president, Curtice traveled abroad twice, spending millions each time with on-the-spot decisions.

The early months of Curtice&#x27;s GM tenure saw fears of a recession. In February 1954, with the economy still lagging, Curtice announced that GM would spend $1 billion (approximately $12 billion today) in expanding its plants and facilities in anticipation of the boom to come. This set off a spree of capital spending by other corporations, which helped ensure the recovery of the economy. Ford matched the billion with a billion of its own, while Chrysler announced plans to spend $500 million. Meanwhile, Curtice, a poker player, upped the ante by announcing plans to spend a second billion. Curtice saw that the economy would recover, and was prepared for it. In 1955, GM sold five million vehicles and became the first corporation to earn a billion dollars in a year. Curtice was given &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year&quot; recognition for 1955 because &quot;in a job that required it, he has assumed the responsibility of leadership for American business. In his words &#x27;General Motors must always lead.&#x27;&quot; During his presidency, he was only at his home in Flint at the weekends; he remained at GM headquarters during the week.

In 1956, he announced plans to devote another billion to capital investment, the largest such sum ever invested by a single firm in a single year. At the peak of his earning ability, he made $800,000 per year (over $9 million today).

He was succeeded by John F. Gordon Jr., who was president 1958–1965, and who was succeeded by Frederic G. Donner 1965–1967.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1971.

==Later life==
On reaching 65, Curtice retired on August 31, 1958. He remained a director of GM. In 1959, he accidentally shot and killed the retired GM vice president, Harry W. Anderson, while on a duck hunting trip to Canada.

Curtice resided in Flint throughout his career. He died at his home in 1962, aged 69, of an apparent heart attack, and was interred at in Glenwood Cemetery.

<doc id="420506" wikidata="Q455589" url="?curid=420506" title="Meng Haoran">
<text>Meng Haoran (; 689/691–740) was a Chinese poet and a major literary figure of the Tang dynasty. He was somewhat an older contemporary of Wang Wei, Li Bai and Du Fu. Despite his brief pursuit of an official career, Meng Haoran spent most of his life in and around his hometown Xiangyang of the Hubei Province living like a hermit, while creating poems inspired by its landscapes and milieu.

Meng Haoran was a major influence on both contemporary and subsequent poets of the Tang dynasty due to his excellency in Shanshui poetry and his composed, independent spirit. Meng was prominently featured in the Qing dynasty (and subsequently frequently republished) poetry anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems, having the fifth largest number of poems selected for a total of fifteen, exceeded only by Du Fu, Li Bai, Wang Wei, and Li Shangyin. These poems of Meng Haoran were made available in English translations by Witter Bynner and Kiang Kanghu with the publication of &quot;The Jade Mountain&quot; in 1920. In 2021, a complete translation of all Meng&#x27;s poems by Paul W. Kroll was published as &quot;The Poetry of Meng Haoran&quot;, which also contains an introduction of Meng&#x27;s life and historical contexts of his poetry.

The &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; also collected two poems by Li Bai addressed to Meng Haoran, one in his praise and one written in farewell.

==Biography==

One of the major poets during a peak era of the Tang Poetry, known as the High Tang, Meng Haoran was born in Xiangyang District, Xiangfan, south of the Han River, in the modern province of Hubei. He remained strongly attached to this area and its scenery throughout his life.

He had the desire to pursue a career in politics in his youth, but never successes in securing an official position. As recorded by the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, he was recommended by his good friend Wang Wei to Emperor Xuanzong, who granted him an audience during which he recited his poem. However, one line therein angered the emperor: &quot;The untalented the wise lord discards&quot; (), which Xuanzong interpreted as a sarcastic complaint for not employing him sooner in the imperial government. Thus, he was sent away from the palace. He received his only quasi-civil service position as an advisor to Zhang Jiuling three years before his death, but resigned after less than a year due to his aloofness and pride. He lived in the Xiangyang area almost all his life, except for a brief trip to the capital city of Chang&#x27;an where he was hosted by Wang Wei in 728. The landscape, history and legends of his hometown are the subjects of a majority of his poems. Some particularly prominent landmarks include Nanshan (or South Mountain, his family seat) and Lumen Shan, a temple site, where he briefly lived in retreat.

==Works==
Meng Haoran is often bracketed with Wang Wei, due to the friendship they shared and their prominence as landscape poets. In fact, Meng composed several poems about Wang and their parting. While Wang&#x27;s work focused on the natural world, in particular the solitude and reprieve it granted from human life along with the scale of the natural world, Meng&#x27;s poetry focuses more on foreground details and human life, such as returning villagers waiting at the ferry crossing, fishermen, or (often unseen) mountain hermits dwelling in religious seclusion.

Meng&#x27;s poetic language was as simple as everyday conversation, yet this simplicity did not diminish their careful craftsmanship. Critics have noted that Meng&#x27;s artistry resides in his adeptness at transforming ordinary daily experiences into enduring poetry.

Meng&#x27;s quatrain &quot;Spring Morning&quot; () is one of the best known Tang poems, partly due to its inclusion as the opening piece of the Qian-Jia Shi (Poems of a Thousand Masters), a beginner&#x27;s anthology of verses widely adopted in elementary curriculum since the late Song dynasty.

== Reception and Legacy ==
Meng was highly regarded by his contemporaries, notably both Li Bai and Du Fu had written poems in his praise. According to Du Fu, Meng&#x27;s poetry surpassed those of Bao Zhao and Xie Lingyun in quality. Li Bai&#x27;s tribute, on the other hand, honored Meng&#x27;s noble character and independent spirit. Song dynasty critics held that Meng&#x27;s poetry excelled in creativity but lacked depth and breadth in its topics. Su Shi likened Meng&#x27;s artistry to that of a skilled wine maker with supreme craftsmanship but a shortage of ingredients. 20th century scholar Wen Yiduo aligned with Li Bai in his assessment of Meng, praising his poetry as an genuine expression of his serene demeanor and hermit lifestyle.

The themes and styles of Meng Haoran&#x27;s Shanshui poetry helped to set a convention followed by younger poets, such as Wang Wei.

<text>Maʼadim Vallis is one of the largest outflow channels on Mars, about 700 km long and significantly larger than Earth&#x27;s Grand Canyon. It is over 20 km wide and 2 km deep in some places. It runs from a region of southern lowlands thought to have once contained a large group of lakes (see Eridania Lake) north to Gusev crater near the equator. It looks as if water may have collected in Gusev crater, forming a giant lake; the Spirit Rover was sent there to investigate that possibility, but found only volcanic rocks on the floor of Gusev. Any lake deposits were probably covered over by a later deposit of volcanic materials from Apollinaris Mons, a nearby volcano.

Maʼadim Vallis is in the Aeolis quadrangle.

Maʼadim Vallis is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in Mars&#x27; history. Some of the short narrow channels along the walls of Maʼadim are probably sapping channels. Sapping occurs when groundwater partially dissolves and undermines the rock, which collapses into debris deposits and is carried away by other erosion processes.

&quot;Maʼadim&quot; (מאדים) is the Hebrew name of the Planet Mars.

<text>This page features lists of species and organisms that have become extinct. The reasons for extinction range from natural occurrences, such as shifts in the Earth&#x27;s ecosystem or natural disasters, to human influences on nature by the overuse of natural resources, hunting and destruction of natural habitats.

In actual theoretical practice, a species not definitely located in the wild in the last 50 years of current time is textually called &quot;extinct&quot;.

<doc id="420514" wikidata="Q142609" url="?curid=420514" title="William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst">
<text>William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst (14 January 177313 March 1857) was a British diplomat and colonial administrator who served as the Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William from 1823 to 1828.

==Background and education==
Born at Bath, Somerset, Amherst was the son of William Amherst and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Paterson. He was the grand-nephew of Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, and succeeded to his title in 1797 according to a special remainder in the letters patent. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 13 October 1789, receiving a BA in 1793 and an MA in 1797.

==Ambassador extraordinary to China==
In 1816 he was sent as ambassador extraordinary to the court of China&#x27;s Qing dynasty, with a view of establishing more satisfactory commercial relations between China and Great Britain. On arriving at Pei Ho (Baihe, today&#x27;s Haihe), he was given to understand that he could only be admitted to the Jiaqing Emperor&#x27;s presence on condition of performing the kowtow. To this, Amherst, following the advice of Sir George Thomas Staunton, who accompanied him as second commissioner, refused to consent, as Macartney had done in 1793, unless the admission was made that his sovereign was entitled to the same show of reverence from a mandarin of his rank. As a consequence of this, he was refused entry into Peking (Beijing), and the object of his mission was frustrated.

His ship, the &quot;Alceste&quot;, after a cruise along the coast of Korea and to the Ryukyu Islands on proceeding homewards, was totally wrecked on a submerged rock in Gaspar Strait. Amherst and part of his shipwrecked companions escaped in the ship&#x27;s boats to Batavia, whence relief was sent to the rest. The ship in which he returned to England in 1817 touched at St Helena and, as a consequence, he had several interviews with the emperor Napoleon (see Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings of the Late Embassy to China&quot;, 1817; McLeod&#x27;s Narrative of a Voyage in H.M.S. &quot;Alceste&quot;, 1817). There is undocumented speculation that in one of the interviews, Napoleon said, &quot;China is a sleeping giant. Let her sleep. For when she wakes, she will shake the world.&quot;

==Governor-General in India==
Amherst was Governor-General of India from August 1823 to February 1828. The principal events of his government were the annexation of Assam leading to the first Burmese war of 1824, resulting in the cession of Arakan and Tenasserim to the British Empire.

Amherst&#x27;s appointment came on the heels of the removal of Governor-General Lord Hastings in 1823. Hastings had clashed with London over the issue of lowering the field pay of officers in the Bengal Army, a measure that he was able to avoid through successive wars against Nepal and the Marathan Confederacy. However, his refusal in the early 1820s during peacetime to lower field pay, resulted in the appointment of Amherst, who was expected to carry out the demands from London.

However, Amherst was an inexperienced governor who was, at least in the early days of his tenure in Calcutta, influenced heavily by senior military officers in Bengal such as Sir Edward Paget. He inherited a territorial dispute from John Adam, the acting Governor-General prior to his arrival, which involved the Anglo-Burmese border on the Naaf River and this spilled over into violence on 24 September 1823. Unwilling to lose face in a time of Burmese territorial aggression, Amherst ordered the troops in.

The war was to last two years, with a price tag of 13 million pounds, contributing to an economic crisis in India. It was only due to the efforts of powerful friends such as George Canning and the Duke of Wellington that Amherst was not recalled in disgrace at the end of the war.

The war significantly changed Amherst&#x27;s stance on Burma, and he now adamantly refused to annexe Lower Burma, but he did not succeed in repairing his reputation entirely, and he was replaced in 1828. He was created Earl Amherst, of Arracan in the East Indies, and Viscount Holmesdale, in the County of Kent, in 1826. On his return to England he lived in retirement till his death in March 1857.

==Family==
Lord Amherst married twice and, remarkably, both his wives were dowager countesses of Plymouth. His first wife was Sarah, Dowager Countess of Plymouth (1762–1838), daughter of Andrew Archer, 2nd Baron Archer and widow of Other Windsor, 5th Earl of Plymouth (died 1799). She was more than ten years older than him, and the mother of several children. They were married in 1800 and had two sons as well as a daughter Lady Sarah Elizabeth Pitt Amherst. Sarah died in May 1838, aged 76, after about 38 years of marriage. Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant was named after Sarah; it was at her instigation that the species was introduced from Asia to Bedfordshire. The genus &quot;Amherstia&quot;, a Burmese flowering tree, is also named after her.

In 1839, a year after the death of his first wife, Lord Amherst, aged 66, married the widowed daughter-in-law of his first wife. This was Mary, Dowager Countess of Plymouth (1792–1864), elder daughter and co-heiress of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, and widow of his stepson Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth (1789–1833). Although this was an unusual marriage, it was not forbidden by either Church law or civil law. His second wife had no children, from either of her marriages.

Lord Amherst died on 13 March 1857, aged 84 at Knole House in Kent, the seat of the Dukes of Dorset, a property which his second wife had inherited. He was survived by his second wife, Lady Amherst, heiress of Knole, who died on 20 July 1864, aged 71, at Bournemouth. Lord Amherst was succeeded in his titles by his second and only surviving son, William.

<text>Li Shangyin (, 813858), courtesy name Yishan (), was a Chinese poet and politician of the late Tang dynasty, born in the Henei Commandery (now Qinyang, Henan). He is noted for his imagist and &quot;no-title&quot; () poetic style. Li has been frequently anthologized, and many of his poems have been translated into various languages, including several collections in English.

==Biography==
Li Shangyin was born in 812 or 813 CE. The exact date is uncertain. His career was rough, and he never obtained a high-ranking position, because of either factional disputes or his association with Liu Fen (), a prominent opponent of the eunuchs.

==Historical background==
Li lived at a time when the Tang dynasty was rapidly declining, after 200 years of prosperity.

Culturally, politically, and economically, the Tang was one of the greatest periods in Chinese history. The cosmopolitan capital of Chang&#x27;an was filled with traders from the Middle East and other parts of Asia where many Asian vassal states sent envoys to pay tribute. The empire covered a vast territory, the largest yet in Chinese history. Under the reign of Emperors Gaozuyi through Taizong, Empress Wu, and Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang empire steadily grew to the height of its prosperity.

But after the An Lushan Rebellion, the country&#x27;s political and economic structure began to disintegrate. The rebel generals fighting against the Tang court during and after the rebellion were allowed to surrender and given military governor posts, even after the rebellion&#x27;s leaders were vanquished. Peace and stability over the entire area of Hebei was heavily bought by a compromise settlement. These provincial governors paid only lip service to the central government. The court, now weak and impotent, tolerated their growing independence, wary also of the aggression of the Tibetans toward the northwest who posed a constant threat to the capital.

During the subsequent years, military governors repeatedly challenged imperial authority with attempts to claim hereditary succession, resulting in revolts and bloodshed. Apart from this loss of control over the provincial military leaders and other problems at the frontiers, the Tang court was internally plagued by the increasingly powerful eunuchs and the fierce Niu–Li factional strife.

=== Rise of the eunuchs ===
The eunuchs first gained political influence as a group when Gao Lishi helped Emperor Xuanzong rise to power. Later, Li Fuguo also helped put Emperor Suzong on the throne. By gaining royal patronage, eunuchs gradually controlled personal access to the emperors and participated in the business of the central government. They also involved themselves with provincial appointments, at times even intervening with armed forces in disputes over imperial successions. By the time of Li Shangyin, the emperors had allowed the eunuchs to become fully entrenched both militarily and politically. After Xuanzong, all Tang emperors (except Jingzong) were put on the throne by the eunuchs.

=== Sweet Dew Incident ===
In 835 the infamous &quot;Sweet Dew Incident&quot; occurred during the reign of Emperor Wenzong. A palace coup, designed by Li Xun (the prime minister) and Zheng Zhu (the military governor of Fengxiang) in support of Wenzong&#x27;s effort to overthrow the eunuchs, failed. The eunuchs, led by Qiu Shiliang, slaughtered the clans of many high officials and chief ministers. Many other innocent people were killed in connection with this event. The eunuchs, whose power had been growing out of control, now completely dominated the Emperor and the affairs of state.

=== Niu-Li factional strife ===
The Niu-Li factional strife was another destructive internal force haunting the Tang court. The Niu and Li factions were not organized political parties, but two groups of rival politicians, hostile toward each other as a result of personal animosity. The Niu faction was represented by Niu Sengru and Li Zongmin and the Li faction by Li Deyu. In the 830s the two contending factions created much turmoil in court through the reigns of Emperors Muzong, Jingzong, Wenzong, Wuzong, and Xuanzong, a period coinciding almost exactly with Li Shangyin&#x27;s life. According to Chen Yinke, the struggle was also due to a difference in social background between the two groups, one representing the traditional ruling class of North China and the other the newly risen class of scholar-officials who reached their positions through the civil service examinations. In any case, many intellectuals and high officials were involved in this struggle. When members of one faction were in power, people associated with the other would be demoted, or out of favor. The factional strife kept court officials from uniting against the increasing power of the eunuchs.

=== Decline of the eunuchs ===
The emperors, rendered completely helpless, tried to play one force against another. It was 50 years after Li Shangyin&#x27;s death that the eunuchs were finally eradicated with the help of the military governors, precipitating the Tang dynasty&#x27;s downfall. The 45 years of Li Shangyin&#x27;s life spanned the reign of six emperors. Among them, Xianzong and Jingzong were murdered by the eunuchs. Muzong, Wuzong, and Xuanzong indulged in escapist practices; Wuzong, for example, died of an overdose of elixir drugs.

==Poetry==
Li Shangyin is well known for his poetry. In the many published editions of the poetry anthology &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;, the number of his poems ranks below only Du Fu, Li Bai, and Wang Wei. Li&#x27;s poetry is distinguished from mainstream Classical Chinese poetry by his extensive use of love as a major theme as well as the unconventional decision to leave many collected verses untitled.

Li was a typical Late Tang poet: his works were sensuous, dense and allusive. The latter quality made adequate translation extremely difficult. The political, biographical, or philosophical implications contained in some of his poems have been a subject of debate for many centuries in China.

===Poetic style===
Li&#x27;s poetry takes various Classical Chinese poetry forms. The Chinese critical tradition tends to depict Li as the Tang dynasty&#x27;s last great poet. The Tang dynasty ended in 907 CE and, after a period of disunity, was succeeded by the Song dynasty in 960 CE. The Song poetry style, although drawing on traditional forms, is especially noted for the development of the &quot;ci&quot; (Wade-Giles: &quot;t&#x27;zu&quot;) form, which was characterized by providing fresh lyrics to fixed-meter tunes. Li Shangyin&#x27;s poetry played an important transitional role as part of this developmental process. James J. Y. Liu, who shared the first comprehensive collection of English translations of Li&#x27;s poetry, described him as &quot;one of the most ambiguous if not the most ambiguous poets.&quot;

=== &quot;The Brocade Zither (Chin-se, 錦瑟)&quot; ===
Li&#x27;s most famous and cryptic poem is arguably &quot;Jin Se&quot;, or &quot;Chin-se&quot; () (&quot;The Brocade Zither&quot;, also translated as &quot;The Ornamented Zither&quot; or &quot;The Exquisite Zither&quot;) (the title is taken from the first two characters of the first verse, as this is one of Li&#x27;s &quot;no title&quot; poems) (original text and translation seen below), consisting of 56 characters and a string of images. 

James J. Y. Liu noted that there were five major interpretations of what Li intended to convey, including frustration about his career trajectory and commemoration of his deceased wife, among others.

=== &quot;Derangements of My Contemporaries (Za Zuan, 雜纂)&quot; ===
&quot;Derangements of My Contemporaries&quot; (Za Zuan, &quot;雜纂&quot;, or &quot;random compilations&quot;) was not viewed as poetry nor prose in Li&#x27;s lifetime, but some scholars considered it a precedent for &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; authored by Sei Shōnagon, and believed that it offered a peak into the Tang dynasty beyond its classic image of a cultural &quot;golden age&quot;.

Chloe Garcia Roberts translated it in 2013 with a grant from PEN America. The volume was published in 2014 with New Directions. Lucas Klein of Arizona State University, another key translator of Li&#x27;s poetry, described Roberts&#x27; work as a &quot;small rebirth of the poetic vanguard of Chinese poetry translation&quot; in a 2016 &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; essay titled &quot;Tribunals of Erudition and Taste: or, Why Translations of Premodern Chinese Poetry Are Having a Moment Right Now&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
In 1968, Roger Waters of the rock band Pink Floyd borrowed lines from Li&#x27;s poetry to create the lyrics for the song &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; from the band&#x27;s second album &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;.

More recently, Li Shangyin&#x27;s poem &quot;When Will I Be Home?&quot; is alluded to and quoted from by the protagonist of Peter Heller&#x27;s 2012 novel, &quot;The Dog Stars&quot;. The novel ends with a reprinting of the poem in full.

His name is mentioned, and one of his poems is quoted, in Episode 119 of the Korean TV series &quot;구암 허준&quot;.
