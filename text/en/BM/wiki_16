<text>Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project aimed to help scientists develop new therapeutics for a variety of diseases by the means of simulating protein dynamics. This includes the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins, and is reliant on simulations run on volunteers&#x27; personal computers. Folding@home is currently based at the University of Pennsylvania and led by Greg Bowman, a former student of Vijay Pande.

The project utilizes graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), and ARM processors like those on the Raspberry Pi for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods. As part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project&#x27;s database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers&#x27; participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.

Folding@home is one of the world&#x27;s fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.22 exaflops by late March 2020 and reached 2.43 exaflops by April 12, 2020, making it the world&#x27;s first exaflop computing system. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October 1, 2000, Folding@home has been involved in the production of 226 scientific research papers. Results from the project&#x27;s simulations agree well with experiments.

== Background ==

Proteins are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein&#x27;s chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.

Due to the complexity of proteins&#x27; conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales that they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process (i.e., random) and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.
Protein folding does not occur in one step. Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, &quot;waiting&quot; in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein&#x27;s energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov state model (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule&#x27;s conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein&#x27;s phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.

Between 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude. In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million CPU days of simulations over the span of several months, and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10 million CPU hours of computing. In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-residue NTL9 protein out to 1.52 milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein&#x27;s energy landscape. In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award from the American Chemical Society for the development of the open-source MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment. For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate Bárány Award for Young Investigators for &quot;developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and RNA folding&quot;, and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which &quot;have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Pande&#x27;s efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.&quot;

== Examples of application in biomedical research ==
Protein misfolding can result in a variety of diseases including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, cancer, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, cystic fibrosis, Huntington&#x27;s disease, sickle-cell anemia, and type II diabetes. Cellular infection by viruses such as HIV and influenza also involve folding events on cell membranes. Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells&#x27; natural ability to regulate protein folding. Such therapies include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process. The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the rational design of therapeutics, such as expediting and lowering the costs of drug discovery. The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer&#x27;s.

The simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding &quot;in vitro&quot; differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein&#x27;s refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of Protein L, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.

The large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website. The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the Blue Gene supercomputer, and they share Folding@home&#x27;s key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas. In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home&#x27;s MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large computer clusters or supercomputers. Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer&#x27;s is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.

Preventing Aβ aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, according to Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.

In December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of Aβ aggregates. In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on biological tissue. In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several mutations of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of Aβ oligomers. Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.

=== Huntington&#x27;s disease ===
Huntington&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have been applied to Huntington&#x27;s.

=== Cancer ===
More than half of all known cancers involve mutations of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53&#x27;s protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation&#x27;s results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.

Folding@home is also used to study protein chaperones, heat shock proteins which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a protein that helps T cells of the immune system attack pathogens and tumors. However, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a mutant form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta ===
Osteogenesis imperfecta, known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen&#x27;s triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer&#x27;s and Huntington&#x27;s research.

=== Viruses ===
Folding@home is assisting in research towards preventing some viruses, such as influenza and HIV, from recognizing and entering biological cells. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme RNase H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.

Following detailed simulations from Folding@home of small cells known as vesicles, in 2007, the Pande lab introduced a new computing method to measure the topology of its structural changes during fusion. In 2009, researchers used Folding@home to study mutations of influenza hemagglutinin, a protein that attaches a virus to its host cell and assists with viral entry. Mutations to hemagglutinin affect how well the protein binds to a host&#x27;s cell surface receptor molecules, which determines how infective the virus strain is to the host organism. Knowledge of the effects of hemagglutinin mutations assists in the development of antiviral drugs. As of 2012, Folding@home continues to simulate the folding and interactions of hemagglutinin, complementing experimental studies at the University of Virginia.

In March 2020, Folding@home launched a program to assist researchers around the world who are working on finding a cure and learning more about the coronavirus pandemic. The initial wave of projects simulate potentially druggable protein targets from SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the related SARS-CoV virus, about which there is significantly more data available.

=== Drug design ===
Drugs function by binding to specific locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current &quot;in silico&quot; methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home&#x27;s computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.

Chemical activity occurs along a protein&#x27;s active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein&#x27;s conformation and ultimately affect the protein&#x27;s activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.

Approximately half of all known antibiotics interfere with the workings of a bacteria&#x27;s ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome&#x27;s exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.

== Patterns of participation ==
Like other distributed computing projects, Folding@home is an online citizen science project. In these projects non-specialists contribute computer processing power or help to analyze data produced by professional scientists. Participants receive little or no obvious reward.

Research has been carried out into the motivations of citizen scientists and most of these studies have found that participants are motivated to take part because of altruistic reasons; that is, they want to help scientists and make a contribution to the advancement of their research. Many participants in citizen science have an underlying interest in the topic of the research and gravitate towards projects that are in disciplines of interest to them. Folding@home is no different in that respect. Research carried out recently on over 400 active participants revealed that they wanted to help make a contribution to research and that many had friends or relatives affected by the diseases that the Folding@home scientists investigate.

Folding@home attracts participants who are computer hardware enthusiasts. These groups bring considerable expertise to the project and are able to build computers with advanced processing power. Other distributed computing projects attract these types of participants and projects are often used to benchmark the performance of modified computers, and this aspect of the hobby is accommodated through the competitive nature of the project. Individuals and teams can compete to see who can process the most computer processing units (CPUs).

This latest research on Folding@home involving interview and ethnographic observation of online groups showed that teams of hardware enthusiasts can sometimes work together, sharing best practice with regard to maximizing processing output. Such teams can become communities of practice, with a shared language and online culture. This pattern of participation has been observed in other distributed computing projects.

Another key observation of Folding@home participants is that many are male. This has also been observed in other distributed projects. Furthermore, many participants work in computer and technology-based jobs and careers.

Not all Folding@home participants are hardware enthusiasts. Many participants run the project software on unmodified machines and do take part competitively. By January 2020, the number of users was down to 30,000. However, it is difficult to ascertain what proportion of participants are hardware enthusiasts. Although, according to the project managers, the contribution of the enthusiast community is substantially larger in terms of processing power.

=== Performance ===
Supercomputer FLOPS performance is assessed by running the legacy LINPACK benchmark. This short-term testing has difficulty in accurately reflecting sustained performance on real-world tasks because LINPACK more efficiently maps to supercomputer hardware. Computing systems vary in architecture and design, so direct comparison is difficult. Despite this, FLOPS remain the primary speed metric used in supercomputing. In contrast, Folding@home determines its FLOPS using wall-clock time by measuring how much time its work units take to complete.

On September 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so. Top500&#x27;s fastest supercomputer at the time was BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS. The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS, followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones in August 2008 and September 28, 2008 respectively. On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008&#x27;s fastest supercomputer was IBM&#x27;s Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home&#x27;s performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS. On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.

Further use grew from increased awareness and participation in the project from the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. On March 20, 2020 Folding@home announced via Twitter that it was running with over 470 native petaFLOPS, the equivalent of 958 x86 petaFLOPS. By March 25 it reached 768 petaFLOPS, or 1.5 x86 exaFLOPS, making it the first exaFLOP computing system.

, the computing power of Folding@home stands at 14.3 petaFLOPS, or 27.5 x86 petaFLOPS.

=== Points ===
Similarly to other distributed computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing contributions to the project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though through the use of a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.

Users can register their contributions under a team, which combine the points of all their members. A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an Internet forum. The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research. Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.

If a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a &quot;Default&quot; team. This &quot;Default&quot; team has a team number of &quot;0&quot;. Statistics are accumulated for this &quot;Default&quot; team as well as for specially named teams.

== Software ==
Folding@home software at the user&#x27;s end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.

=== Work units ===
A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer&#x27;s computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points. This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium 3 450 MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.

Before public release, work units go through several quality assurance steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home&#x27;s work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.

=== Cores ===

Specialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as &quot;FahCores&quot; and often abbreviated &quot;cores&quot;, perform the calculations on the work unit as a background process. A large majority of Folding@home&#x27;s cores are based on GROMACS, one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations. Although GROMACS is open-source software and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a closed-source license to help ensure data validity. Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used AMBER, CPMD, Desmond, and TINKER, but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service. Some of these cores perform explicit solvation calculations in which the surrounding solvent (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform implicit solvation methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum. The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation checkpoints so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.

=== Client ===

A Folding@home participant installs a client program on their personal computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client&#x27;s settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.

Professional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home&#x27;s code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home&#x27;s data servers (over port 8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client&#x27;s graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.

However, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it does not practically prevent the modification (also known as patching) of the executable binary files. Likewise, binary-only distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a man-in-the-middle attack while being downloaded via the internet, or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. patched), or by decompiling and recompiling them after modification. These modifications are possible unless the binary files – and the transport channel – are signed and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always. Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed, the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.

Folding@home uses the Cosm software libraries for networking. Folding@home was launched on October 1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first client was a screensaver, which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with David P. Anderson to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.

==== Graphics processing units ====
The specialized hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open-source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.

Before 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in error detection and correction in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected soft errors in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.

The first generation of Folding@home&#x27;s GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October 2, 2006, delivering a 20–30 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April 10, 2008, it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June 6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home&#x27;s GPU client (GPU3) was released on May 25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home&#x27;s most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project&#x27;s x86 FLOPS throughput.

Native support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.

==== PlayStation 3 ====

From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of PlayStation 3s. At the time of its inception, its main streaming Cell processor delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the Xbox 360. The PS3&#x27;s high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl&#x27;s law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.

The PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March 23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September 18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of Life with PlayStation on its launch. In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU&#x27;s flexibility and a GPU&#x27;s speed. However, unlike clients running on personal computers, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3&#x27;s uniform console environment made technical support easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.

On November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a &quot;game changer&quot; for the project.

==== Multi-core processing client ====
Folding@home can use the parallel computing abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot; relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.

In November 2006, first-generation symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under Windows. On January 24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.

SMP2 supports a trial of a special category of &quot;bigadv&quot; work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February 7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2&#x27;s bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.

==== V7 ====
The V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March 22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.

V7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7&#x27;s open-source GUI, named FAHControl. This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a back-end application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or &quot;slot&quot;). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3&#x27;s viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.

==== Google Chrome ====
In 2014, a client for the Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client used Google&#x27;s Native Client (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@home code at near-native speed in a sandbox on the user&#x27;s machine. Due to the phasing out of NaCL and changes at Folding@home, the web client was permanently shut down in June 2019.

==== Android ====
In July 2015, a client for Android mobile phones was released on Google Play for devices running Android 4.4 KitKat or newer.

On February 16, 2018, the Android client, which was offered in cooperation with Sony, was removed from Google Play. Plans were announced to offer an open source alternative in the future.

== Comparison to other molecular simulators ==
Rosetta@home is a distributed computing project aimed at protein structure prediction and is one of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta&#x27;s software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.

Anton is a special-purpose supercomputer built for molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-μs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton&#x27;s traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton&#x27;s. However, unlike Folding@home&#x27;s shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein&#x27;s phase space. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton&#x27;s and Folding@home&#x27;s simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.

<text>Taroko National Park () is one of the nine national parks in Taiwan and was named after the Taroko Gorge, the landmark gorge of the park carved by the Liwu River. The park spans Taichung Municipality, Nantou County, and Hualien County and is located in Xiulin Township, Hualien County, Taiwan.

==History==

This national park was originally established as the by the Governor-General of Taiwan on 12 December 1937 when Taiwan was part of the Empire of Japan. After the Empire of Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the Republic of China took over Taiwan in consequence. The ROC government subsequently abolished the park on 15 August 1945. It was not until 28 November 1986 that the park was reestablished. In 2002 it was named a potential World Heritage Site. Taroko National Park covers an area of . It is located in Hualien County, Taichung City, and Nantou County, and is home to unique geological and natural resources, including twenty-seven peaks over located in and around the Qilai and Nanhu Mountain ranges. It includes the marble gorge of Taroko, the Qingshui Cliff, the trail along the Shakadang River, and the waterfalls of the Baiyang trail.

The Central Cross-Island Highway (Provincial Highway 8) extends from Asian tropical deciduous forests to high mountain pine and cedar forests.

On November 28, 2021, Google commemorated the park on its homepage doodle to celebrate its 35th anniversary.

In 2024, a magnitude 7 earthquake struck Taiwan&#x27;s eastern coast, resulting in widespread devastation and significant loss of life. Landslides obstructed Provincial Highway No. 8 at Taroko Gorge, trapping hundreds of individuals. The landscape of Taroko Gorge, was scarred by the aftermath of the earthquake mainly due to the landslides that occurred. Due to the earthquake and floods later in 2024, much of the park remains closed as of 2025.

== Origin of the name ==
The name &quot;Taroko&quot; (太魯閣) derives from the Truku tribe, an indigenous group formally recognized by the Taiwanese government as of 2004. The Truku tribe originally resided in the upper region of the Zhuoshi river (濁水溪) before migrating eastward towards Hualien County through Mt. Qilai (Mt. Qilai: Truku language called &quot;Klbiyun&quot;) to the Liwu River. The Truku tribe continues to reside in Hualien County, including within the designated National Park area.

== Geology ==

Taiwan was created through the collision of the Philippine and the Eurasian plates in what is known as the Penglai Orogeny. This movement occurred some four million years ago and is responsible for the formation of the Central Mountain Range that runs north-south through much of Taiwan. Even today the shift in tectonic plates continues and this area continues to rise a few millimeters every year.

Marble formations only revealed themselves after millions of years of erosion and continued uplifting. Calcium Carbonate remains accumulated some 230 million years ago. These deposits through time, pressure, and the elements were gradually lithified into the limestone that in turn metamorphosed into marble. As Taiwan was uplifted from the pressures of the colliding plates, the erosive forces of weathering and water worked to carve out the gorges we see today.

Erosion by the river against the constantly elevating land combined with the heavy sub-tropical rains resulted in a rapid transformation of the landscape. Marble, which is relatively hard and resistant to erosion, nevertheless relented to these forces resulting in the unusually steep and narrow canyons.

The gorge itself was carved into the marble by the erosive power of the Liwu River.

==Transportation==
Taroko National Park is typically accessed from Hualien City where various tours, buses, and transport options are available next to the Hualien Train station. The closest train station to the park is Xincheng Station of the Taiwan Railways Administration, roughly from the park&#x27;s main headquarters. Due to Xincheng&#x27;s distance from the park itself, visitors looking to get closer to the park will typically utilize the many tour buses and taxis available.

<text>QRIO (&quot;Quest for cuRIOsity&quot;, originally named Sony Dream Robot or SDR) was a bipedal humanoid entertainment robot developed and marketed (but never sold) by Sony to follow up on the success of its AIBO entertainment robot. QRIO stood approximately 0.6 m (2 feet) tall and weighed 7.3 kg (16 pounds). QRIO&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Makes life fun, makes you happy!&quot;

On January 26, 2006, on the same day as it announced its discontinuation of AIBO and other products, Sony announced that it would stop development of QRIO. 

==Development==
The QRIO prototypes were developed and manufactured by Sony Intelligence Dynamics Laboratory, Inc. The number of these prototypes in existence is unknown. Up to ten QRIO have been seen performing a dance routine together; this was confirmed by a Sony representative at the Museum of Science in Boston, MA on January 22, 2006. Numerous videos of this can be found on the web.

Four fourth-generation QRIO prototype robots were featured dancing in the &quot;Hell Yes&quot; music video by recording artist Beck. These prototypes lacked a third camera in the center of the forehead and the improved hands and wrists which were added to later prototypes. It took programmers three weeks to program their choreography.

QRIO is capable of voice and face recognition, making it able to remember people as well as their likes and dislikes. A video on QRIO&#x27;s website shows it speaking with several children. QRIO can run at 23 cm/s, and is credited in Guinness World Records (2005 edition) as being the first bipedal robot capable of running (which it defines as moving while both legs are off the ground at the same time). The 4th generation QRIO&#x27;s internal battery lasts about 1 hour.

==In popular culture==
In 2005, four QRIO robots appeared in the music video for &quot;Hell Yes&quot; by Beck. The robots dance along to the music. 

In the 2009 series finale of the reimagined television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, the virtual Number Six and virtual Baltar appear in coda set on modern-day Earth. They comment on the cycle of violence perpetuated by humanity&#x27;s interaction with &quot;technology run amok&quot;. The final scene then shows a montage of real-life robots, starting with a Sony QRIO.

<text>The Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico (Chihuahua-Pacific Railway), also known as El Chepe from its reporting mark CHP, is a major rail line in northwest Mexico, linking the city of Chihuahua to Los Mochis and its port, Topolobampo. It crosses the Sierra Madre Occidental, part of the range that in the United States is called the Rocky Mountains. There is no road covering the trajectory.

It runs , traversing the Copper Canyon, a rugged series of canyons that have led some to call this the most scenic railroad trip on the continent. It is both an important transportation system for locals and a draw for tourists.

The tracks pass over 37 bridges and through 86 tunnels, rising as high as above sea level near Divisadero (the continental divide), a popular lookout spot over the canyons. Each one-way trip takes roughly 16 hours. The track also crosses over itself to gain elevation.

The headquarters were in turn located in Mexico City, Chihuahua and Los Mochis.

==History==
The concept of the railroad was officially recognized in 1880, when the president of Mexico, General Manuel González, granted a rail concession to Albert Kinsey Owen of the Utopia Socialist Colony of New Harmony, Indiana, United States, who was seeking to develop a socialist colony in Mexico. The railroad was actually built by Arthur Stilwell as the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway, starting about 1900.

From 1910 to 1914, Mexico North Western Railway (sp. &quot;Ferrocarril del Noroeste&quot;) completed the Temosachic-Casas-Grandes line. &quot;Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway&quot; completed the Chihuahua-Ojinaga section. Enrique Creel&#x27;s &quot;Chihuahua al Pacífico&quot; railroad completed the Chihuahua-Creel section.

In 1940, Mexico acquired the rights from &quot;Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway&quot;. In May 1952, Mexico took possession of a line operated by &quot;Mexican Northwestern Railway&quot;. In 1955, Mexico merged them as &quot;Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacifico, S.A. de C.V.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chepe.mx/story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial difficulties caused by the cost of building a railroad through rugged terrain delayed the project, and the ChP was not completed until 1961.

The private rail franchise Ferromex took over the railroad from the Mexican government in 1998.

==Schedule==
In general, two different passenger trains run daily: &quot;Chepe Regional&quot;, a slower service with more stops for locals, with 15 official stops and more than 50 flag stops at which boardings or disembarkations can be made at passenger request, and the other a luxury, &quot;Chepe Express&quot;, direct service for tourists, which is faster and more expensive. First-class trains are composed of two to three cars, each holding 64 passengers. Second-class trains have three or four cars, each holding 68 passengers.

There is also regular cargo service running between Topolobampo and Chihuahua that might be further increased and extended so as to connect with the Texas Pacifico Transportation Railroad at the Ojinaga Presidio Crossing into the United States as a part of the La Entrada al Pacifico.

On its way from Los Mochis to Chihuahua it runs through El Fuerte, Temoris, Bahuichivo, Posada Barrancas, Divisadero, and Creel, among others.

== In popular culture ==
* The American funk group Vulfpeck named a song off their 2016 album (&quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;) &quot;El Chepe&quot; which features sounds of a train on a track.

<doc id="413126" wikidata="Q334257" url="?curid=413126" title="Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville">
<text>Peter Leonard Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville (3 March 1934 – 13 May 2023), was a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, and was a member of Parliament (MP) representing London and Westminster from 1977 to 2001.

==Early life==
Brooke was born in London, the son of Henry Brooke, the onetime Home Secretary, and Barbara Mathews. His parents were one of the few married couples where both partners held noble titles in their own right. His younger brother was the judge Sir Henry Brooke. He was educated at Marlborough College and Balliol College, Oxford, (where he was President of the Oxford Union) before going on to the Harvard Business School in the United States. After leaving university he worked as a headhunter and was Chairman of Spencer Stuart.

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully challenging Neil Kinnock at the Labour stronghold of Bedwellty in October 1974, he was elected as MP for the City of London and Westminster South in a by-election in 1977. He was sworn into the Privy council in 1988. He was made Chairman of the Conservative Party in 1987, and then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in 1989. His speech, made in November 1990 in London, is largely credited with bringing Sinn Féin to the negotiating table, in which he declared that Britain had no &quot;selfish strategic or economic interest&quot; in Northern Ireland and would accept unification, if the people wished it.

In January 1992, Brooke appeared on the Irish chat show, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. After a pleasant interview, the presenter, Gay Byrne, coaxed and goaded the unwilling Brooke into singing &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;, on a day when seven Protestant construction workers had been killed by an IRA bomb. Many unionists were outraged at what seemed to be a moment clearly out of touch with grieving families, and requested the resignation of Brooke. The incident was a factor in Brooke&#x27;s being dropped from his position after the April 1992 general election, although Brooke claimed he had offered his resignation after the incident.

After leaving the Cabinet, Brooke stood unsuccessfully for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons. The House instead elected the Labour MP Betty Boothroyd to the role, with several Conservative MPs voting against Brooke on the grounds that he had too recently been in the Cabinet and was thus insufficiently close to the backbenches. Brooke then remained on the backbenches for a short time, before being brought back into the Cabinet later in the year as Secretary of State for National Heritage, a role he held until 1994. During his time as Heritage Secretary, he oversaw the restoration of Windsor Castle following the fire that had struck the State Apartments in 1992.

==Later life==
Brooke stepped down as an MP at the 2001 general election and was created a life peer as Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, of Sutton Mandeville in the County of Wiltshire, on 30 July 2001. He was Chairman of the Association of Conservative Peers. He was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, as his father had been, in 1992. He retired from the House of Lords on 18 September 2015.

==Personal life and death==
In 1964, Brooke married Joan Smith; they had four sons, one of whom died as an infant, and were married until her death in 1985, from complications of a surgical procedure. He married Lindsay Allinson in 1991.

Brooke died in Tisbury, Wiltshire, on 13 May 2023, at the age of 89.

<text>Hualien County (Mandarin Wade–Giles: Hua¹-lien² Hsien⁴; Pīnyīn: &quot;Huālián Xiàn&quot;; Hokkien POJ: &quot;Hoa-lian-koān&quot; or &quot;Hoa-liân-koān&quot;; Hakka PFS: &quot;Fâ-lièn-yen&quot;; Amis: &quot;Kalingko&quot;) is a county on the east coast of Taiwan. It is Taiwan&#x27;s largest county by area, yet due to its mountainous terrain, has one of the lowest populations in the country. The county seat and largest city is Hualien City. Hualien County is located in the eastern part of Taiwan—the Pacific Ocean lies to its east and the Central Mountain Range lies to its west. Narrow and long, Hualien is the largest county in Taiwan in terms of area.

Most of its population resides in the Huadong Valley, which runs north to south between the Central and Hai&#x27;an mountain ranges. Hualien&#x27;s natural environment attracts many visitors and some of its natural attractions include Taroko Gorge, Qingshui Cliff, and Qixingtan Beach.

Much of modern-day Hualien County was populated by the Sakizaya people before the arrival of the Spanish, Dutch, and Han Chinese under Qing annexation. The region was renamed Karenkō Prefecture in 1895 during Japanese colonial rule. In 1945, after the end of World War II, the Republic of China took control of Taiwan and renamed the former Karenkō Prefecture as Hualien County of Taiwan Province.

Qing dynasty records give the name of the region as &quot;Huilan&quot; () due to the whirling of waters in the delta.

===Empire of Japan===

During Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese colonial period (1895–1945) the island&#x27;s Japanese governors opted not to transliterate the name &quot;Kiray&quot; because the Japanese pronunciation of the word resembled the Japanese word for .

<doc id="413130" wikidata="Q3528190" url="?curid=413130" title="Geoffrey Boycott">
<text>Sir Geoffrey Boycott (born 21 October 1940) is a former Test cricketer, who played cricket for Yorkshire and England. In a prolific and sometimes controversial playing career from 1962 to 1986, Boycott established himself as one of England&#x27;s most successful opening batsmen. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.

Boycott made his international debut in a 1964 test match against Australia. He was known for his ability to occupy the crease and became a key feature of England&#x27;s Test batting line-up for many years, although he was less successful in his limited One Day International appearances. He accumulated large scores – he is the equal fifth-highest accumulator of first-class centuries in history, eighth in career runs and the first English player to average over 100 in a season (1971 and 1979) – but often encountered friction with his teammates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records/First-class matches/Batting records/Most hundreds in a career&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Never highly popular among his peers, journalist Ian Wooldridge commented of him that &quot;Boycott, in short, walks alone&quot;, while cricket writer John Arlott wrote that Boycott had a &quot;lonely&quot; career. Others have said that the extent of his introverted nature has been exaggerated, and that while he was obsessed with his own success he was not by nature a selfish player. After 108 Test match appearances for England, Boycott&#x27;s international career ended in 1982 when he was the leading Test run scorer with over 8,000 Test match runs, earning him an OBE for services to cricket. When dropped from the Yorkshire team in 1986 he was the leading run scorer in first-class cricket. In 1965, while still a young player, he had been named as one of five Cricketers of the Year by &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers&#x27; Almanack, and he was inducted into the International Cricket Council&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2009.

After his playing career ended, Boycott became an often outspoken and controversial cricket commentator on radio and television, never slow to criticise modern players&#x27; techniques. In 1998, he was convicted in France of assaulting his former girlfriend Margaret Moore; he was fined and given a suspended sentence. In 2002, after being diagnosed with throat cancer, he underwent successful radiation treatment, and went into remission. He revived his commentating career in 2003, attracting both criticism and praise. He is a former member of BBC Radio 4 &quot;Test Match Special&quot; commentary team and retired in 2020.

==Early life==
Boycott was born in the mining village of Fitzwilliam, near Wakefield and Pontefract in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the eldest of three sons of Jane (née Speight) and Thomas Wilfred Boycott, a colliery worker from Little Dawley, Shropshire.

When Boycott was eight years old, he was impaled through his chest by the handle of a mangle after falling off an iron railing near his home. Boycott nearly died, and in the efforts to save his life, his spleen was removed. In March 1950, Boycott&#x27;s father had a serious accident while working as a coalminer, suffering severe damage to his spine after he was hit by empty coal carts: he never fully recovered, and died in 1967.

Boycott began to play cricket at an early age in Fitzwilliam&#x27;s terraced streets, using a manhole for the wicket. He later claimed that it was at this time that he developed his favourite shots: the square cut, the clip to leg and the straight drive, &quot;because it you hit it straight past the bowler it went right to the bottom of the street, and you could run as many runs as you could get.&quot;

He attended Fitzwilliam Primary School, at which he won a Len Hutton batting award for scoring 45 runs and capturing six wickets for 10 runs in a school match. At age 10, he joined Ackworth Cricket Club, demonstrating &quot;outstanding ability&quot;. At the age of 11, he failed the examinations that would have taken him to grammar school, so instead went to the local Kinsley Secondary Modern School. A year later, however, he passed his late-entry exams, and transferred to Hemsworth Grammar School. His cricket prowess was such that he captained the school&#x27;s cricket First XI at the age of 15. During winters he attended an indoor cricket school, where he was coached by former county professional Johnny Lawrence.

While studying for his O-levels, he began to have difficulty reading the blackboard and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, his cricket playing suffered, encumbered by the fragile spectacles. However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned for him at the behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on to be a strong influence on Boycott&#x27;s early cricketing game while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school&#x27;s Individual Cricket Cup. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.

Boycott told the BBC in 1965 that he chose to leave school at 17 because he no longer wished to be a financial strain on his parents, and because he wanted to pursue his cricketing career. He worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Barnsley from 1958 to 1963, at the same time playing for a number of cricket clubs. Boycott captained the South Elmsall district team and achieved a batting average of 70. He also played for the Yorkshire Federation&#x27;s Under-18 team and for Barnsley, where he was noticed by Clifford Hesketh, a member of Yorkshire&#x27;s County Cricket team committee.

==County career==
Boycott began playing for his home county in 1962 after topping the averages for Leeds, Yorkshire Colts and Yorkshire Second XI. In 414 matches for Yorkshire he scored 32,570 runs at an average of 57.85, with a highest score of 260 not out against Essex, and 103 centuries in all. He scored another 8,699 runs in List A cricket, averaging 40.08. Boycott twice averaged over 100 in an English first-class season: 100.12 in 1971, and 102.53 in 1979. He is one of only two players to have achieved this, Mark Ramprakash being the other. Boycott was appointed captain of Yorkshire in 1971, but was sacked in 1978 after failing to win a trophy while in charge. He was then dismissed as a player, but reinstated after a members&#x27; revolt. During his career Boycott frequently clashed with other strong personalities at the club, including Fred Trueman, Brian Close and Ray Illingworth, but remained popular with the Yorkshire crowds.

===First years===
Before he played in first-class cricket, Boycott played for the successful Barnsley Cricket Club, making his debut in 1959 and becoming a regular team member that year alongside Dickie Bird and Michael Parkinson. In one match against Scarborough, Boycott faced a delivery from Bill Foord which he dispatched to the boundary for four. Foord turned to Parkinson and asked: &quot;Christ almighty, what&#x27;s this lad&#x27;s name?&quot; Bird remembered his &quot;application, concentration and absolute belief in himself. He had one great gift, mental strength. You can have all the coaching in the world but the most important thing is to be mentally strong.&quot; Although Bird later left Boycott out of his choice XI, he would write: &quot;of all the great players I have seen, if I had to pick a batsman to bat for my life, I would go for Geoffrey.&quot; He made his Yorkshire Second XI debut on 6 July 1959 against Cumberland at Penrith, scoring five and 15.

Boycott made his Yorkshire first-team debut on 16 June 1962 against the Pakistan touring team. He opened the batting, scoring four in both innings – the first from a boundary off of his first ball in first-class cricket – and taking one catch, but he did not bowl. He went on to play his first County Championship match the next day, on 20 June, against Northamptonshire. Batting at number four, he scored six and 21*.

Early in his career, Boycott continued to play in his spectacles, and later switched to contact lenses. He feared his career would have ended had he not used such aids as his eyesight was poor. Boycott&#x27;s initial appearances for Yorkshire failed to impress, and he was compared unfavourably to his main rival, John Hampshire. When Brian Close took over from Vic Wilson as captain of Yorkshire in 1963 he persuaded the committee to keep Boycott on, and was rewarded when, on 2 June 1963, Boycott scored 145 against Lancashire. His century was also part of a 249-run fourth-wicket partnership which became a Yorkshire record. Boycott cemented his place in the Yorkshire XI in the 1963 season with successive scores of 76, 53, 49 not out and 50, and on 29 August made a century partnership in both innings of a match against Leicestershire with Ken Taylor. Boycott handed in his notice to the Ministry of Pensions that same year. After a brief loss of form he kept his place with scores of 62, 28 and 113 in the following matches. This second century again came against Lancashire, making Boycott the first Yorkshire cricketer to score his first two centuries in a Roses match, as the hotly contested Yorkshire versus Lancashire matches were termed.

Boycott went on to hit his highest score thus far, 165 not out, against Leicestershire, and ended his first full season with 1,446 runs at an average of 46.64, placing him second in the 1963 national batting averages. He was awarded his county cap on 2 October. At the start of the 1964 season Boycott hit 151 against Middlesex, followed by another hundred against Lancashire in May, and then played for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Australian touring side at Lord&#x27;s, where he scored 63. On 16 May he completed a third consecutive century, and on 31 May he was called up for the First Test against Australia at Trent Bridge. By the end of the 1964 season, Boycott had topped the country&#x27;s domestic averages with 59.45.

Although he later became renowned for his ability to occupy the crease for hours of defensive play, he was capable of playing attacking cricket. His highest one day score, a match-winning 146, came in the 1965 Gillette Cup final against Surrey. In his previous Gillette Cup match, the quarter-final against Somerset, Boycott took 32 overs to accumulate 23 runs.

According to the captain, Close, at Lord&#x27;s after Yorkshire had slowly reached 22/1, Close promoted himself to number three in the batting order so that he could urge Boycott into action. &quot;I joined Geoffrey in the middle and said to him: &#x27;Listen, if I call, you bloody well run.&#x27; &quot; Boycott later claimed this plan had been agreed on a fortnight previously, and denied such an incident ever occurring.

Boycott subsequently hit 15 fours and three sixes, even though the modern-day fielding restrictions, which facilitate rapid scoring, did not exist in 1965. One shot, a lofted straight drive off England paceman Geoff Arnold was nearly caught by Boycott&#x27;s teammates on the players&#x27; balcony in the pavilion. Close and Boycott added 192 runs for the second wicket, as Yorkshire posted a then-record total of 317. Cricket writer John Woodcock wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;his magnificent innings contained every stroke in the book. &quot;

In the 1966 season Boycott scored two centuries in one match for the first time, against Nottinghamshire on 18 July. Against Leicestershire on 15 June 1968 he carried his bat through an entire Yorkshire innings of 297 all out, remaining unbeaten on 114*. It was the first time he had been unbeaten at the end of an innings. He ended the season top of the national averages for the first time. On 27 July 1970 he scored 260*, his highest first-class score in England, against Essex. At the end of the season, Close was sacked by the club committee in what Boycott called in 1987 &quot;one of the cruellest incidents in the history of sport.&quot; Boycott, on tour in Australia, was awarded the captaincy.

===Captaincy===
Boycott captained Yorkshire for eight seasons from 1971 to 1978, having been appointed following the sacking of Brian Close in 1970. Despite well publicised conflict between the two players, Boycott recorded in 1987 that he regretted Close&#x27;s removal from the club, and wrote him a letter in admiration for his contributions to Yorkshire. To captain Yorkshire had been one of Boycott&#x27;s aims since he started county cricket in 1962. Yorkshire&#x27;s scorer Ted Lester commented later that Boycott &quot;never got the support he deserved from the committee. After the captaincy was decided on a casting vote, the half that didn&#x27;t want him never wanted him.&quot; Some members of the committee wanted to remove him almost immediately. He also caused strife between his fellow players, including a reciprocated dislike for Richard Hutton, with many players leaving the club citing personal differences with Boycott as the reason for their departure.

After his first season as captain he spent the winter of 1971 playing in South Africa for Northern Transvaal. He played only one match, however, scoring 107 and 41.

Boycott&#x27;s eight seasons of captaincy were among Yorkshire&#x27;s least successful. The club failed to win any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The beginning of the end of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503 runs at an average of 100.12, including a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.

Boycott headed the national batting averages in 1972 with 72.35, and was second in 1973 with 63.62. In 1973, however, Yorkshire failed to win any of the 8 championship games with Boycott in charge, and &quot;Wisden&quot; called the season &quot;disturbingly unsuccessful&quot;. It led to further calls for Boycott to be stripped of the captaincy. He was also coming into increased conflict with Richard Hutton, Close, and several members of the committee and senior players. &quot;Looking back,&quot; Boycott wrote in 1987 &quot;I wish I had given up the Yorkshire captaincy at the end of that year.&quot;

In 1974 Boycott&#x27;s form dipped, when he scored only 75 runs in the first innings of the season, other than a non-championship century against Cambridge University. He did, however, score 152* against Worcestershire on 15 May to complete his tour of centuries against every first-class county. Both he and Yorkshire suffered through 1975 and 1976, as did his international career, since he refused to play for England from 1974 until 1977. During the summer of 1978 Boycott broke a finger, so John Hampshire temporarily took over as captain. Boycott returned later in the season, scoring 968 runs at 50.94, but this was second to Hampshire&#x27;s 1,463 at 54.18. A poll of the dressing room showed that 95% of the players wanted a permanent change in the captaincy. On 27 September 1978 Boycott&#x27;s mother, to whom he was very close, died of cancer, placing further pressure on him. She was buried on 2 October. On 29 September, the Yorkshire club committee met with Boycott to discuss terminating his captaincy. A statement by the club outlined Yorkshire&#x27;s intention to retain Boycott as a player while giving the captaincy to Hampshire. Boycott, in response, attacked the Yorkshire club and its decision in an appearance on the BBC&#x27;s flagship chatshow &quot;Parkinson&quot; on 7 October, prompting both strong criticism from the club and strong public support for his own position.

===Later years===
Boycott, after much thought, continued as a player at Yorkshire, scoring 1,941 runs at 61.70 in 1979, hitting six hundreds to pass Len Hutton&#x27;s record of 129 first-class centuries. In 1980 he scored his ninth Roses century, equalling Herbert Sutcliffe&#x27;s record. He also finished the season with an average of over 50.00 for a record eleventh consecutive year, surpassing the achievement of Jack Hobbs. He would experience growing friction with Hutton&#x27;s son, Yorkshire&#x27;s Richard, as well as with later Yorkshire captain John Hampshire. In the early 1980s Boycott continued his run of form, although a slow 347-ball knock of 140* incensed captain, Ray Illingworth, and created friction between Boycott and the rest of the Yorkshire Committee. In 1982 Boycott and Graham Stevenson added a record 149 runs for Yorkshire&#x27;s tenth wicket against Warwickshire, Stevenson scoring 115 of these runs.

On 3 October 1983 the friction between Boycott and the committee culminated in a unanimous decision not to offer Boycott a contract for the next season. This generated much protest from Boycott supporters, who rallied, calling for his reinstatement at a meeting on 9 October in Ossett, Yorkshire. Bill Athey left the club at this time, and while Boycott in his biography maintained that he had no reason to believe that his actions had caused Athey&#x27;s departure, Athey later stated to biographer Leo McKinstry that &quot;Boycott&#x27;s attitude and the atmosphere he created had everything to do with my decision to leave Yorkshire.&quot; The &quot;Members 84 Group&quot;, consisting of strong supporters of Boycott, met regularly to clamour for the batsman&#x27;s reinstatement. Their leader, Peter Briggs, stated &quot;Geoffrey Boycott is a giant playing among pygmies.&quot;

On 21 January 1984 the Yorkshire Club committee, in the face of this rising pressure, agreed to offer Boycott a contract for 1984. Several members of the committee, including Trueman, Billy Sutcliffe and Ronnie Burnet, resigned. Of the replacement members, 17 were from the Members 84 Group, and Boycott himself was elected, leaving him with both a position on the team and on the Yorkshire Club committee. The 1984 season was, however, not the most prolific for Boycott. McKinstry records that he scored slowly in several matches: 60 in 52 overs against Somerset; 53 in 51 overs against Hampshire; 17 in 26 overs against Leicestershire; 77 in 67 overs against Sussex. This was coupled with continued friction between himself and both players and club members. In particular, Boycott&#x27;s place on both the team and the committee led to feelings of distrust from both – though Boycott denies this – which led to the loss of support from long-term ally Sid Fielden.

His success on the field resumed in 1985, where he scored 1,657 runs at 75.31, second only to Viv Richards in the national averages. He also shared a record opening partnership of 351 with Martyn Moxon. In contrast to the poor relations between Boycott and the senior players, many junior members of the team remember 1985 and 1986 as pleasant times to be around Boycott, who often coached them on their technique. 1986 saw Boycott score 890 runs at 52.35, his season cut short by injuries which were becoming more frequent as he passed the age of 45. This season was the first since 1962 that he had not hit an overall total of 1,000 runs; he finished eight short in his final match, when he was run out for 61. He advised the then captain to enforce the follow-on, and did not bat again. Since 1984, support for Boycott had waned in light of his slow scoring, multiple injuries and the general atmosphere around him. Both Brian Close and Ray Illingworth increasingly advocated his removal to Yorkshire&#x27;s committee, and on 23 September 1986 it was confirmed that he would not be offered a contract for the following year. A few months later, captain David Bairstow, a long term ally of Boycott whose leadership had Boycott&#x27;s support, was ruled out of the running for captaincy for the following season, which was instead given to Phil Carrick, of whom Boycott disapproved. Boycott paid tribute to the Reform Group in 1987, describing them as &quot;dedicated Yorkshire members with a heartfelt stake in their club.&quot; He suggests that Close and Illingworth feared his popularity. Boycott was offered contracts by other counties, including Derbyshire and Glamorgan, but he never took these offers up, nor played professional cricket again. At the time of his retirement he had scored more first-class runs than any other active player.

==Test match career==
Over Boycott&#x27;s 18-year career he scored 8,114 runs in 108 Test matches for England. He was the first England cricketer to pass 8,000 Test runs and, as of 2023, is seventh on England&#x27;s all-time run scoring list (behind Alastair Cook, Graham Gooch, Joe Root, Alec Stewart, David Gower and Kevin Pietersen). His average of 47.72 runs over 193 innings is the highest completed career average by an England player since 1970. His Test career included 22 centuries, fourth in England&#x27;s records, held jointly with Wally Hammond, Colin Cowdrey, and Ian Bell and surpassed only by Pietersen (23), Cook (33) and Root (36). England did not lose a Test match in which he scored a century and only 20 of his 108 Tests ended in defeat. John Arlott wrote in 1979 that &quot;any expectation of an English win, except in freak bowling conditions, is based on a major innings from Boycott.&quot;

===Debut year===

Boycott began his Test career on 4 June 1964, only two years after his first-class debut, in the first Test against Australia. He top scored with 48 runs from 118 deliveries before he was bowled by Grahame Corling. The match ended as a rain-affected draw, and Boycott did not bat in the second innings as he had suffered a cracked finger. He made 58 at Old Trafford, and then hit 113 at The Oval, his maiden Test century. He finished his first Test series with 291 runs at 48.50.

In the winter of 1964, Boycott was selected for the England team to tour South Africa. After a series of low scores during the warm-up matches, he was more successful in the Test series. His innings included scores of 73 in the opening Test, 76 in the fourth, and 117 in the fifth and final match. He averaged 49.66 in all first-class cricket during the tour, and took five wickets with the ball as England won the Test series 1–0. He made a mixed impression on the other England players, who were impressed by his talent but perplexed by his introverted attitude each time he was dismissed.

===Early career===

England hosted New Zealand and South Africa in 1965. Against New Zealand, Boycott scored 23 and 44 not out in the first Test at Edgbaston and 76 in the second at Lord&#x27;s, but missed the third Test owing to injury. He returned against South Africa at Lord&#x27;s, but after scores of 31 and a slow 28 in 105 minutes, the press began to speculate that he might lose his place in the team. In the second Test, Boycott made a duck in the first innings and later took 140 minutes to score 16 runs when England needed to score quickly; &quot;Wisden&quot; described the latter innings as a &quot;dreadful effort when courage was needed&quot;. Subsequently, Boycott was dropped and replaced by Eric Russell. Boycott returned to the team at the end of the season for the tour to Australia. In the 1965-66 Ashes series, illness dogged his performance initially. He then hit a form of &quot;brighter cricket&quot; during the First and Second Tests. Uncharacteristically, he hit a four from his very first delivery at Perth, and put on 98 in 16 overs with Bob Barber in the Second Test. In the Third Test, Boycott and Barber shared an opening partnership of 234 in four hours; Boycott hit 84, his highest score of the series. But in the Fifth Test he monopolised the strike, ran out Bob Barber and took 75 minutes to make 17 runs. His form deserted him again when the MCC went on to tour New Zealand.

In 1966, England faced the West Indies. Boycott was omitted from the first Test, but in the second he shared a partnership of 115 with Tom Graveney. However, he struggled during the series and managed an average of 26.57. It was a disappointing year for Boycott both for England and Yorkshire, and his average for the former fell to 36.60. Furthermore, he had only passed 50 twice in his last 12 first-class innings. The following summer, he rediscovered his form. He made his highest Test score of 246 not out against India at Headingley in 1967. His slow scoring frustrated the selectors, who dropped from the team, partly in response to media pressure. A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, for the rest of the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.

Over the next two years, Boycott appeared only intermittently in the Test team. A back injury forced him to miss half of the 1967 season, and an average of 32.40 against the Australians during the 1968 Ashes was unspectacular. Domestically, his injury also limited his contribution; however, he did hit five centuries before he was forced to stop playing in June 1968. Health problems with his spleen and trouble adjusting to wearing contact lenses meant that Boycott missed the tour of Pakistan in 1968/69, but he returned to the team by the summer of 1969, scoring 128 against the West Indies at Old Trafford, and another century at Lord&#x27;s. However, he lost form in the rest of the season; he scored 12 and 0 in the third Test and averaged only 20.20, with two ducks, in the three Tests against New Zealand.

Boycott was left out of the first three Tests against the World XI in 1970; he played in the fourth and scored 15 and 64, and in the final Test of the summer scored 157. He won the Walter Lawrence Trophy for this century. He was selected for the 1970–71 tour of Australia, and averaged 95.93 over all first-class matches. He scored 173 in the opening first-class game, followed by 124 against Queensland. In the third Test match, having hit good partnerships in the first two, Boycott made 77 and 142 not out.

This incident was used as evidence for Boycott&#x27;s selfish attitude for many years after. His highest score was 142 not out in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Sydney, in a 299-run victory. The Fifth Test was drawn, Boycott making 12 and 76*, and in the Sixth Test he was run out for 58. Boycott initially refused to leave the ground in disbelief, and eventually walked off to jeering from the crowd. He made 119 in the second innings but injured his arm against fast bowler Garth McKenzie in a following one-day match and missed the final Test, when England retained the Ashes. He later maintained that the injury permanently affected his wrist, and that he carried a squash ball in a sock in his pocket, which he could squeeze to keep his wrist strong. He ended the series with 657 Test runs at 93.85.

In 1971, Boycott made his One Day International debut against Australia, the press by then touting him as the best batsman in the world. He was the first batsman to receive a ball in a one-day international and his was the first wicket to fall, after he had scored eight runs from 37 balls. In the summer of 1971 he enjoyed an average of over 100 in domestic cricket, and scored 121 not out against Pakistan at Lord&#x27;s.

He played only two Tests in 1972 owing to a series of injuries, but rejoined the team in the West Indies under Denness&#x27;s captaincy. Boycott was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, having earlier made a career-best first-class score of 261 not out against a West Indies Board President&#x27;s XI.

Boycott and Denness did not get on well, and at the end of the tour they clashed over Boycott&#x27;s preference for a one-day match over a three-day game against Bermuda. Boycott recalled in his autobiography that when Denness confronted him on the issue he replied &quot;Get out of here before I do something I&#x27;ll regret.&quot; Boycott had &quot;no confidence in Denness&#x27;s professional ability and no respect for him as a man and another tour like the previous one to the West Indies was the last thing I wanted.&quot;

===Exile===
Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott elected to make himself unavailable for England. He said in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott&#x27;s biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile may also have been linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness&#x27;s captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. 

Boycott has responded to these accusations by pointing out that Lillee had been out of cricket for 21 months suffering from a serious back complaint and that Thomson had not played in Tests for 23 months before the 1974–5 Ashes series, since an unsuccessful debut Test against Pakistan (Thomson&#x27;s match figures were 0–110). Furthermore, he was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best 261 not out against a West Indies Board President&#x27;s XI. All of these teams included Roberts, with a young Holding representing the Board XI.

In the meantime, &quot;When An Old Cricketer Leaves The Crease&quot; was released by Roy Harper in 1975, and again in 1978, dedicated to Boycott and John Snow.

===Comeback Tests===
When Boycott returned to the Test side against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1977 he ran out Derek Randall in front of his home crowd before going on to make a century. In this match, in which Ian Botham made his England debut, Boycott batted on each of the five days of the match: his first innings 107 started at the end of the first day, he batted throughout the second day and was dismissed on the third day; he started his second innings at the end of day four and batted throughout England&#x27;s successful run chase scoring 80 not out, scoring the winning runs in partnership with Randall. Among England batsmen, only Allan Lamb, Andrew Flintoff and Rory Burns have emulated this feat of batting on all five days, and all three subsequent to Boycott. He also had a 215-run partnership with Alan Knott. Botham later remarked that &quot;The Aussies, shell-shocked at having to bowl at Boycott for twenty-two and a half hours, capitulated without much of a fight.&quot;

On 11 and 12 August 1977, he scored 191 against Australia in the fourth Test in front of a full house at his home ground of Leeds, becoming the first cricketer to score his one hundredth first-class century in a Test match. Boycott reached the milestone from the bowling of Greg Chappell with an on drive for four. In the match, Boycott became the fourth English player to be on the field for the entire duration of a Test. Boycott ended the series with 442 runs at an average of 147.33.

Appointed vice-captain for the tour of Pakistan and New Zealand that winter, Boycott assumed the captaincy in 1978 for two Tests when Mike Brearley was injured, and brought with him his successful summer form. However, he was replaced upon Brearley&#x27;s return. While the rest of the England team took part in warm-up matches, Boycott remained in Lahore and organised a special warm-up match in which the team would play itself. However, he went on to occupy the crease for a long period of time, limiting the amount of time other players had to practise. He later stated that, as the number-one batsman, he should have the most time in the middle. In the second Test match, he scored 79 and 100 not out, bringing his Test total since his return to the England team to 684 runs at 136.80. It was between this match and the third Test that Brearley broke his arm, giving Boycott the captaincy. Boycott led England to a draw in the third match, his leadership receiving mixed reviews.

Following Pakistan, Boycott and the England team travelled to New Zealand. In the opening Test match, New Zealand defeated England for the first time in 48 years. Boycott took seven hours and 22 minutes to score 77 runs in the first innings, and in the second innings England were bowled out for 64 when chasing 137 to win. In the second match, Botham&#x27;s first Test century took England to 418, but by the end of the match England needed to score quickly to force a win. Boycott, however, told his team that he would play the way he always had, and proceeded to accumulate runs very slowly. Derek Randall was run out, and Botham went out to bat with his captain, informing the dressing room that &quot;Boycs will be back in here before the end of the over.&quot; Botham then ran Boycott out, later claiming in his autobiography that he had done it deliberately. Indeed, some have suggested that this was a team order. Boycott disputes the suggestion that the run-out was deliberate in his autobiography, referring to Botham&#x27;s account as &quot;a story that gets bigger and more fanciful with every telling&quot;. The tale does nevertheless remain a renowned story. Boycott then delayed his declaration, much to the frustration of England bowler Bob Willis. England did eventually declare, and Willis took 4/14. New Zealand were bowled out for 105 and England won by 174 runs. Boycott suffered a scratch on his cornea and missed the last two days of the final match, and by the start of the 1978 season, Brearley had taken the captaincy back from Boycott.

===Ashes series, West Indies and India===

During the 1978–79 Ashes series, Boycott unusually went in as a Number 11 in the second innings of a match against state side South Australia (not due to injury). At Perth on 15 December, he scored 77 runs without hitting a boundary – the highest total of this nature – though it did include an all-run four. England went on to win the six-Test series 5–1, with Boycott struggling overall through three of the Tests with 263 runs at 21.91. Boycott then played in the 1979 Cricket World Cup held in England, taking two wickets in the opening match against Australia, which England won. The hosts then went on to win their next two games and topped their table for the opening round. Reaching the final after a close victory against New Zealand in which Boycott scored only two, he hit 57 from 105 balls as England chased Viv Richards 138 not out-inspired 286 to win, falling 92 runs short at 194 all out. Boycott ended the competition with the sixth highest strike rate of 42.99 and an average of 23.00.

Following the World Cup, against Australia during a Test match at Perth in 1979–80, Boycott became the first man to be marooned on 99 not out in a Test when he ran out of partners. England then toured the West Indies. Here, Boycott again faced the West Indies&#x27; feared pace attack, but succeeded in scoring centuries off the likes of Holding, Roberts, Colin Croft and Joel Garner, despite having passed the age of 40 the previous year. Other batsmen, such as David Gower, found the attack difficult to cope with, and the later England captain stated that Boycott often had no sympathy. Boycott was the third most successful batsman, behind Gooch and Gower, during a tour in which England went down 2–0. He scored 70 in the opening match, the only England player to pass 50.

In the third match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later said to be Holding&#x27;s greatest over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers to be the best he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding&#x27;s over that &quot;for the first time in my life I can look at a scoreboard with a duck against my name and not feel a profound sense of failure.&quot; Boycott led an England fightback in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding&#x27;s over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers&#x27; record of 8,032.

He then played in the 1981 Ashes series, despite being aged 40. During the second Test at Lord&#x27;s Boycott was dismissed 40 short of a hundred by Dennis Lillee, and was &quot;crushed&quot; given that, as it was his hundredth Test match, he wished to score a century. Forever keen on the England captaincy, Boycott&#x27;s hopes were cut short when Botham&#x27;s 149 not out secured victory in Boycott&#x27;s 101st Test match, and Mike Brearley&#x27;s position as captain was made secure.

During the series, Boycott became concerned with his form and that he may be dropped before he could chase Sobers&#x27; record in the upcoming tour of India. He had scored only 10 and 37 in the Fifth Test; however, in the drawn Sixth Test at The Oval he scored 137, passing Colin Cowdrey&#x27;s record of 7624 runs and becoming England&#x27;s highest run-scorer. He ended the series behind only Botham, with 392 runs at 32.66.

===&#x27;Bye-bye Boycott&#x27;===
Boycott was again refused the captaincy for the next Test series against India over the winter of 1981–82. Angered by this decision, he stated that &quot;even the Yorkshire Ripper got a fair trial in the dock but I&#x27;ve not been given a single chance.&quot; He later battled Keith Fletcher over his slow scoring rate, playing Fletcher&#x27;s comments to him during a press conference using a tape recorder. The series against India was to be his last. In his final ODI match during England&#x27;s tour he scored 6 from 12 deliveries. During the following Test series he passed Sobers&#x27; career run record, hitting 60 in the first Test, 36 and 50 in the second to take him 81 runs short, and in the third Test he overtook the record with a flick off his pads for four. He became the leading Test run-scorer. In his last Test match, the fourth of the tour, taking place in January 1982, he scored 18 and six. During the tour, Boycott claimed he was too ill to field in a Test Match, but it was later discovered that he was playing golf while his teammates were still out on the field.

This led to Boycott being dropped from the side and forced to return to England, despite apologising via a note to the England dressing room. He claimed in his autobiography, however, that he went to the golf course following medical advice to get fresh air. Later in 1982 he was instrumental in organising, in defiance of a United Nations and a TCCB ban, a rebel tour of apartheid South Africa by 13 current and former England Test cricketers, who were almost all nearing the end of their careers. All the players were banned from international cricket for three years as a result. By the mid-1980s, with Boycott in good county form and physical shape, there was speculation that he might return to the England side. David Gower, England captain of the time, stated, however, that &quot;Geoffrey&#x27;s been a marvellous servant for England but we have to look to the future and, in view of his age, it wouldn&#x27;t make an awful lot of sense to pick him again.&quot; This was confirmed by the return of Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson&#x27;s 175 against Australia at Leeds, which prompted Botham, who had once remarked that Boycott was &quot;totally, almost insanely, selfish&quot;, to sing &#x27;Bye-bye Boycott&#x27; from the England balcony.

==Commentator, controversy and personal life==

===Commentating===

Cricket commentator and statistician Simon Hughes states that Boycott is fastidious in the commentary box, always immaculately dressed, and never socialises with the other staff. Bill Sinrich, of Trans World International, commented that Boycott &quot;fulfilled all our hopes. He was animated, intelligent, informed, with opinions that got the attention of most people.&quot;

Boycott laid claim to coining the phrase &quot;corridor of uncertainty&quot; as a reference to the area outside the off stump where a batsman is unsure whether he should leave or hit the ball, and was noted for using a key to measure the hardness of the pitch, until this was outlawed. He is known for stock phrases including (of dropped catches) that his mother or grandmother &quot;could have caught that in her pinny&quot; or (of an easy batting miss) that they could have &quot;hit the ball with a stick of rhubarb.&quot; These phrases inspired much affectionate spoofing of his style.

Boycott was offered a role by Talksport in 1998. He commentated for the station, and for satellite and Asian channels, until 2003. He then returned to commentating of Test matches with Channel 4. In November 2005, Boycott re-joined the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot; to provide commentary for England&#x27;s 2005 tour of Pakistan. In January 2006, Boycott joined Asian channel Ten Sports. He delivered the 2005 Colin Cowdrey Lecture, arguing for day-night Test matches.

Boycott worked on &quot;Cricket on Five&quot; with Mark Nicholas and Simon Hughes as co-commentators, and was a member of the BBC Cricket Team for the 2006/7 Ashes series. His role was to discuss the main talking points. During England&#x27;s 5–0 whitewash by Australia, Boycott stated that the team were undeserving of their MBEs, describing these as &quot;a joke&quot;.

Boycott has been credited with a high level of influence in the game; Yorkshire&#x27;s Chief Executive Stewart Regan credited Boycott for completing a deal for Younis Khan to play county cricket for Yorkshire in 2007. On a larger scale, Boycott has worked towards scrapping the rule at Yorkshire regarding the number of overseas players. He stated that he believed the selectors to be living in &quot;past times&quot;, and that he wished to encourage a growth in the number of players from Pakistan, the West Indies and India.

His on-air commentary has caused controversy. Boycott has renewed his &quot;pull-no-punches&quot; style. He is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005, he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable.

In 2014, Boycott criticised Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir during India&#x27;s tour of England when he was dismissed early on, whereas his fellow commentator Michael Vaughan suggested it was premature to pass judgment so early in the match.

Nevertheless, Boycott has enjoyed a successful commentating career, and his opinions are sought across the cricketing media. As well as newspaper columns, Boycott contributes to online blogs, podcasts and question and answer sessions, such as on the BBC News website and CricInfo. He is popular among cricket pundits and biographers, being the subject of three biographies from 1982 to 2000, while his comments are reproduced across cricketing quotes collections.
In June 2020, Boycott announced his retirement from &quot;Test Match Special&quot;, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and his heart surgery as the reasons.

===Domestic violence and conviction===

Boycott lived for forty years with Anne Wyatt.

In 1996, a former lover, Margaret Moore, accused Boycott of assault. He denied the charges. He was convicted in his absence at the first trial in January. In the second trial, in October 1998, Boycott was given a three-month suspended sentence by a French magistrates&#x27; court, and his £5,300 fine was confirmed. 

Boycott maintained his innocence and unsuccessfully appealed the conviction. In 2015, an investigation by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that Moore&#x27;s injury had been caused by a fall, while a separate incident documented in court papers revealed Moore&#x27;s barrister had demanded £1 million from Boycott in return for her silence. Moore&#x27;s lack of honesty had been documented in court cases relating to her business. After his conviction, Boycott was sacked by both BSkyB and BBC Radio, and from his columnist&#x27;s job in &quot;The Sun&quot;. 

Boycott carried on working overseas, particularly in India. He hosted &quot;The Sunny and Boycs Show&quot; with Sunil Gavaskar and the touring Indian team at his home in August 2002. Boycott married Rachael Swinglehurst on 26 February 2003. They have a daughter, Emma (born October 1988).

===Throat cancer===

Boycott commentated for Talksport, and both Indian and South African television programmes in 2002, during which he suffered a continual sore throat. Finding a lump while shaving, Boycott returned to England, and on 20 August 2002 was examined at Leeds General Infirmary. By 3 September 2002, he was informed that he had four cancerous tumours in his throat.

Initially, surgeons recommended an eight-hour procedure to remove the tumours; their size and proximity to his voice box eventually persuaded them to recommend radiotherapy, of which Boycott had 35 sessions from 22 October. By December, scans revealed that the majority of the tumours had gone; the final tumour&#x27;s disappearance was confirmed in early 2003. Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a public statement, which evoked an emotional response. On 16 August 2003, he was given a standing ovation by the crowd at Trent Bridge as he and other cricketers did a lap of the ground in vehicles to celebrate Trent Bridge&#x27;s 50th Test match. In early July 2024, Boycott revealed he had been diagnosed with throat cancer for a second time. He underwent a three hour operation later that month.

===Return to commentary===

Boycott resumed writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and commentating on Channel Four for the Cheltenham and Gloucester Championship Final and the following summer&#x27;s cricket. BBC Radio 5 Live then hired Boycott in early 2004. His illness altered his voice and led to a more pleasant personality. In September 2004, Boycott wrote a posthumous tribute to lifelong friend Brian Clough for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

In early 2008, there was speculation that Boycott would be given a role on the England coaching staff, but this came to nothing. He continued commentating for TMS, criticising the England team&#x27;s approach to the ODI matches under Pietersen in India in November 2008. Also in November, Leo McKinstry published a new biography of Boycott.

On 2 January 2009, Boycott was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. He remained an active member of the cricket community, voicing his support in late April 2009 for Pakistan player Saeed Ajmal, and calling for the legalisation of the doosra spin-bowling delivery. In July 2009 he criticised Kevin Pietersen for his captaincy difficulties, and in September he criticised Andrew Flintoff for favouring club cricket over internationals. 
On 29 November 2009, Boycott was heard swearing on air in an ODI following a catch taken by Paul Collingwood that dismissed Ryan McLaren. The BBC issued an apology for the incident.
Having long been nicknamed &quot;Sir Geoffrey&quot;, Boycott was given that title when appointed a Knight Bachelor in Theresa May&#x27;s resignation honours on 10 September 2019. In response to criticism from anti-domestic abuse campaigners about his knighthood, Boycott said that he &quot;does not give a toss&quot;.

===Politics===

Boycott supported the UK Independence Party and criticised &quot;the way governments of all colours have handed powers to Brussels&quot;. He also expressed his support for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, saying, &quot;She&#x27;ll be like Margaret Thatcher, she&#x27;ll be brilliant.&quot;

===Presidency of Yorkshire, &quot;Corridor of Certainty&quot;===

In March 2012, Boycott was elected President of Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Elected at an annual meeting, he gained 91.09% of the vote. The election came on the back of Yorkshire&#x27;s relegation from the first to the second division of the County Championship, the reversal of which Boycott targeted immediately upon taking up the post. He remarked to the media that &quot;The only thing that really matters to the membership is that Yorkshire do well in Championship cricket.&quot; His tenure also presided over the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2013. In February 2014, it was revealed that former Test umpire and Yorkshire player Dickie Bird would replace Boycott.

In March 2013, Boycott and his partner Rachael Swinglehurst purchased the Grade II listed Boston Hall in Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, citing a desire to be closer to family, friends, and Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Later in 2014 he released a book entitled &quot;Geoffrey Boycott: The Corridor of Certainty&quot; with Simon &amp; Schuster. ESPNcricinfo reviewed the piece in October, commenting on Boycott&#x27;s more amiable personality since his recovery from cancer: &quot;we have a much more rounded and nuanced book, full of self-awareness and a willingness, even eagerness, to acknowledge errors, failings and regrets... This a complex, driven man, whom we all recognise and admire for his achievements, revealing aspects of his life and survival that have hitherto been kept close to his chest.&quot;

==Playing style==

Boycott&#x27;s playing style revolved around intense concentration, solid defence and attention to detail, while avoiding heavy hitting or slogging. He was described in &quot;The Complete Encyclopaedia of Cricket&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest opening batsmen that the game has known. He dedicated his life to the art of batting, practising assiduously and eschewing any shot that might even hint at threatening the loss of his wicket.&quot; Through his Test career, he scored 15.4% of England&#x27;s runs, and England won 32.41% of the Tests in which Boycott played. This compares with England&#x27;s 34.76% victory rate over all Test cricket history. Richard Hutton, Yorkshire and England batsman and son of Len Hutton, described Boycott as a &quot;one-pace player&quot;, suggesting that he was unable to alter his playing pace as the match circumstances dictated. Nevertheless, Boycott maintained an &quot;impeccable&quot; defensive technique, and possessed a temperament ideally suited for five-day Test matches. Arlott wrote that &quot;his technique is based on a defence organised as near flawlessness as may be.&quot; Boycott himself remarked, in 1981, that: &quot;Given the choice between Raquel Welch and a hundred at Lord&#x27;s, I&#x27;d take the hundred every time.&quot; His careful batting is reflected in his 22 centuries for England, of which only two had a strike rate of over 51.00. Former England bowler Frank Tyson wrote in 1987, in &quot;The Test Within&quot;, that &quot;the greatness of Boycott the batsman and the gaffes of Boycott the man had common roots in an unceasing quest after perfection.&quot; Boycott also kept a black book which he used to record bowlers&#x27; tendencies.

While this style facilitated his solid defensive play, it inhibited him as a stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries, especially his left shoulder, elbow and forearm due to his high elbow to control the bat on defensive strokes. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required the tip of a broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. He was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was to get him out on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott&#x27;s dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.

At the start of his career, Boycott was a below average fielder, having received no coaching on this from Yorkshire and with little inclination to rectify it when concentrating on his batting. A fellow Yorkshire batsman Ken Taylor worked with Boycott, who was &quot;limited in [fielding] ability, &quot; but had &quot;tremendous determination&quot;. With further help from his two brothers Boycott&#x27;s fielding improved. He became a safe pair of hands generally at cover point, though he continued to lack power and pace in the field, never taking more than two catches in a Test innings, and averaging 0.170 dismissals per innings with 33 career catches in all.

==Written works==
Boycott has written a number of works on cricket, including his own autobiography and a joint project on the biography of umpire Dickie Bird:
* &quot;Geoff Boycott&#x27;s Book for Young Cricketers&quot;, 1976.
* &quot;Put to the Test&quot;, 1979.
* &quot;Opening up&quot;, 1980.
* &quot;In The Fast Lane&quot;, 1981
* &quot;Sir Geoffrey. 21 Years of Yorkshire Cricket&quot;, 1984.
* &quot;Boycott: The Autobiography&quot;, 1987.
* &quot;Free as a Bird: Life and Times of Harold &quot;Dickie&quot; Bird&quot; with David Hopps, 1997.
* &quot;Boycott on Cricket&quot;, 1990.
* &quot;Geoffrey Boycott on Cricket&quot;, 1999.
* &quot;The Best XI&quot;, 2008
* &quot;Geoffrey Boycott: The Corridor of Certainty&quot;, 2014

==Records==
* &quot;Wisden&quot;, a Cricketer of the Year for 1965, when he played nine Test matches, scoring 617 runs with one century and four fifties at an average of 47.46.
* Winner of the Walter Lawrence Trophy in 1970.

==Test matches==

Boycott&#x27;s abilities in the Test match theatre during his career of 17 years and 216 days have left him with a number of Test cricket records. He is the seventh most capped player for England in Tests, and has the sixth highest career runs total in Tests for an England player, 8114. He was the fourteenth quickest player to reach 8,000 runs, taking 190 innings.

He topped the national averages for six seasons, the highest of any post-World War II player, and is tied for fourth in the list of centuries for England behind only Joe Root, Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen. England were unbeaten in all 22 test matches in which he scored a century (won 10, drawn 12).

Boycott was also the first player to score 99 not out, and the first to score 99 and then a century in a Test match. The forty-eight century partnerships he was involved was a record for any England player, but has again been surpassed by Alastair Cook. In 1977 against Australia, Boycott became the first England player to bat on all five days of a Test match on his return to international cricket at Trent Bridge. He spent the 629 minutes at the crease for 191 runs in 1977.

===Opening partners===
Such was Boycott&#x27;s longevity in the game that he had 16 opening partners for England.
The reason why these figures cover only 191 of Boycott&#x27;s 193 Test innings is because he batted at No.4 in both innings of the third Test against West Indies at Bridgetown in March 1974 (after Denness, Amiss and Jameson). He opened the batting in the other four Tests in that series.

===Career performance===


==One-Day Internationals==
Boycott&#x27;s ODI career was noticeably less productive than his Test. He did, however, face the first One-Day International ball ever bowled, and was the first batsman to be dismissed in what was the first ever ODI game. The match, considered a one-off at the time due to ODI cricket being in its infancy, was hastily arranged to cover a washed out 1970-71 Ashes Test.

== In popular culture ==
Boycott is mentioned in a verse of the Roy Harper song &quot;When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease&quot;, from the album &quot;HQ&quot; (1975), though the album was renamed after the song for its release in the United States. The song uses the sport of cricket as a metaphor for death and mentions Boycott alongside another England cricketer from the time, John Snow, both by first name only in the line &quot;And it could be Geoff and it could be John&quot;. The song is dedicated to both of them.

==Honours==

* Boycott was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the Civil Division in the 1980 Birthday Honours &quot;for services to Cricket&quot;.
* He was knighted in the 2019 Resignation Honours of Theresa May.
* He was awarded honorary life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1993.
* He was president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 2012 and 2014.
* He was awarded an honorary doctorate of Sports Science by Leeds Metropolitan University on 20 July 2010.&#x27;

Ferromex operates more than of track and interconnects five major inland Mexican cities, five cities along the border with the United States, four seaports on the Pacific Ocean, and one more on the Gulf of Mexico. Grupo México owns 74% and Union Pacific Corporation owns 26% of the company. The Ferromex system operates 9,610 km of Ferromex tracks plus of Ferrosur tracks.

== Passenger services ==
Ferromex hosts the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico &quot;ChePe&quot; railroad, a tourist line that runs through the Copper Canyon. Ferromex also operates the Tequila Express, which runs from Guadalajara to a tequila distillery in Amatitán.

== Merger with Ferrosur ==
In November 2005, Grupo México, the majority owner of Ferromex, purchased Infraestructura y Transportes Ferroviarios, the parent company of Ferrosur, another of Mexico&#x27;s Class I railroads, in a stock transaction. The Mexican Federal Competition Commission (CFC) had rejected a proposed 2002 merger of Ferromex and Ferrosur amid opposition from Ferromex competitor Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM).

Following the November 2005 purchase of Ferrosur by Grupo México, Kansas City Southern de México (KCSM), successor to TFM, petitioned the Mexican government to block the merger of Ferrosur and Ferromex. The CFC rejected the merger in June 2006 and stated that the merger would have led to excessive concentration in the railway industry to the detriment of consumers and competing shippers. However, in March 2011, a tribunal ruled in Grupo México&#x27;s favor, and the merger was permitted.

== Rolling stock ==
In January 2011, Ferromex ordered 44 new SD70ACe locomotives from EMD, its first order since 2006.

== Other ==
Grupo México Transportes, with Fundación Grupo México, operates Dr. Vagón, a hospital train that offers free, complete healthcare for hard to reach communities in Mexico.

<doc id="413137" wikidata="Q1544896" url="?curid=413137" title="Greg Chappell">
<text>Gregory Stephen Chappell (born 7 August 1948) is a former cricketer who represented Australia at international level in both Tests and One-Day Internationals (ODI). The second of three brothers to play Test cricket, Chappell was the pre-eminent Australian batsman of his time who allied elegant stroke making to fierce concentration. An exceptional all round player who bowled medium pace and, at his retirement, held the world record for the most catches in Test cricket, Chappell&#x27;s career straddled two eras as the game moved toward a greater level of professionalism after the WSC schism. He was the vice captain of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1975 Cricket World Cup.

Since his retirement as a player in 1984, Chappell has pursued various business and media interests as well as maintaining connections to professional cricket; he has been a selector for national and Queensland teams, a member of the Australian Cricket Board, and a coach.

== Family and early life ==
Born in Unley, South Australia, Chappell was the second of three sons born in Adelaide to Arthur Martin and Jeanne Ellen (née Richardson), a Cornish Australian family. He was steeped in the game from a very early age: his father Martin was a noted grade cricketer in Adelaide who put a bat in his hands as soon as he could walk, while his maternal grandfather was the all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who had captained Australia in Test cricket. Elder brother Ian and younger brother Trevor also played for Australia, and Greg closely followed in Ian&#x27;s footsteps to the top. Given weekly lessons by coach Lynn Fuller, the brothers fought out fierce backyard cricket matches, with no holds barred. The fraternal relationship between Ian and Greg became legendary in Australian cricketing history for volatile verbal slanging matches, even during hard fought Test matches, which had their genesis in the family backyard.

Chappell attended St Leonards primary school, where he played his first competitive match at the age of eight; he also played a lot of baseball. Quite small for his age, Chappell developed a technique for dealing with the high bouncing ball by playing most of his shots to the leg side. Aged twelve, he hit his first centuries and was selected for the South Australian state schools team. He was then enrolled at Plympton high school for two years before following brother Ian and attending Prince Alfred College on a scholarship. Chappell recalled himself being an &quot;economical&quot; student whose mind often wandered to the cricket field during class. In the summer of 1964–65, Chappell suddenly grew ten centimetres in seven weeks and within twelve months had shot up to 189 cm. With this greater physical presence, Chappell was able to dominate schoolboy matches; in one of his matches for the school&#x27;s First XI he scored a double ton and combined with classmate (and future Test teammate) Ashley Woodcock to put on more than 300 runs for the first wicket against Scotch College. Chappell&#x27;s cricket coach at Prince Alfred, former first-class player Chester Bennett, described Chappell as &quot;possibly the finest all-round schoolboy cricketer in my experience...he could go far in the game.&quot;

==Cricket career==
=== Early first-class career ===
The Chappell brothers played grade cricket for Glenelg and they batted together for the first time in a semi final against Port Adelaide in early 1966. Later that year, Ian was chosen for the Test tour to South Africa, which opened up a place in the South Australian team. Greg seized the opportunity by scoring 101*, 102* and 88 for his club, then made his first-class debut against Victoria at Adelaide Oval, aged 18. Hampered by a throat infection, Chappell still managed 53 and 62* to earn an extended trial in the team. The remainder of the season brought another 386 runs in 14 innings, including a maiden century against Queensland.

With the return of the Test players the following summer, Chappell held his place in the South Australian side and was promoted to the number four position, following brother Ian at number three. The highlight of Chappell&#x27;s season was a brilliant 154 against Western Australia, but his continuing preference for leg side shots was seen as a weakness if he wanted to make Test cricket. During a brief dressing room encounter with the great Don Bradman, then a state and national selector, Chappell was advised to change his grip on the bat in order to improve his off-side play. Without hesitation, Chappell made the recommended change and at season&#x27;s end, wrote to the English county team Somerset, asking for a contract to play county cricket to further his development.

During two seasons with the county, Chappell scored 2493 first-class runs at a moderate average of 30. Hitherto, Chappell bowled leg spin, but after his growth spurt had found it difficult to land the ball on a consistent length. The green pitches in England encouraged him to experiment with seam-up medium pace, which produced immediate results: he finished with 71 wickets for Somerset, including 7 for 40 against Yorkshire at Leeds in 1969. In his first season, he was capped by Somerset after belting the Middlesex attack for three hours in making 148. Shortly after was hit a severe blow to the eye when hooking at a bouncer from England fast bowler John Snow in a match against Sussex. In between these stints in England, Chappell scored 707 runs (including two centuries) in the 1968–69 Australian season, which made him a favourite to break into the Australian squad for the tour of India and South Africa. His subsequent omission in favour of West Australian unknown Jock Irvine cause a sensation at the time.

=== Early test career (1970–1973) ===
Entering the 1969–70 season, Chappell hit four hundreds to earn a place on an Australian A trip to New Zealand. Scoring 519 runs at 57.70, he was the dominant batsman of the tour and with the Test team failing in South Africa, he only needed a solid start to the next season to force his way in to play against England in the 1970–71 Ashes Series. After acting as twelfth man in the first Test, he was selected to bat at number seven for the second match, the first Test played at Perth&#x27;s WACA ground. During an historic century on debut, he teamed with Ian Redpath to add 219 runs and haul Australia out of a difficult situation. Just days after the Test, he belted 102 in two hours against the English in a tour match. However, the dream start affected Chappell, who struggled for the rest of the series, apart from a score of 65 in the last Test. In the main, he was getting out by playing too many big shots early in his innings.

The inconsistent form continued the following season, when he was omitted from the Australian team for the series with a Rest of the World XI. Press criticism led to a rethink of his mental approach, and when reinstated a new Chappell emerged. He invented what became known as the Chappell &quot;vee&quot; where he played the ball exclusively in a narrow arc between mid off and mid on until he felt he had his eye in. This reorganisation brought him scores of 115* and 197* in the third and fourth unofficial Tests.

Chappell&#x27;s new-found approach continued to yield results on the 1972 Ashes tour of England. Going into the second Test at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, Australia was down 1–0, after losing the first Test at Old Trafford by 89 runs. In a match that would be remembered for Bob Massie&#x27;s remarkable 16-wicket haul, Chappell&#x27;s masterful 131 in Australia&#x27;s first innings was a key component in squaring the series. Coming in after Australia had lost its first two wickets with only seven runs on the board, Chappell combined with older brother Ian to steady the innings. The pair put on 75 runs for the third wicket, with Chappell happy to hold down one end while Ian took charge of the scoring. Chappell would not score his first boundary until three hours into his innings, but thereafter the runs flowed. He managed to bring up a well-deserved century just before the close of play on Day Two, and batted for a further hour-and-a-half the next day before he was bowled by Basil D&#x27;Oliveira. He had batted for over six hours and hit 14 boundaries. Chappell himself rated this his best innings, as did Richie Benaud, who wrote:

...I thought it close to the most flawless innings I had seen and I still believe that to be the case. It was beautifully elegant with wonderfully executed strokes, great technique and it exhibited a deep knowledge of what was needed to square the series&quot;

His game went from strength to strength. In the fifth Test at the Oval, he hit another ton, sharing a big partnership with Ian as they became the first brothers to score Test centuries in the same innings. Against Pakistan he made 116* and 62 at Melbourne and bagged 5 for 61 at Sydney. On the subsequent trip to the West Indies, he achieved the rare feat of scoring a thousand runs on a Caribbean tour, which included 106 in the Test at Bridgetown, Barbados.

In recognition of his outstanding 1972 Ashes tour, Chappell was named, along with fellow Australians Bob Massie, Dennis Lillee and Keith Stackpole, as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1973.

With the Australian team now undergoing a dramatic renaissance, Chappell was the leading batsman, giving him a huge national profile. This brought a lucrative offer to move to Brisbane and captain the Queensland side, as a precursor to taking over the Australian captaincy when Ian decided to retire. He made the move in the winter of 1973.

=== Move to Queensland (1973–1974) ===
The interest in his arrival in Queensland was enormous as he was expected to lead the state to its first Sheffield Shield title. Although Chappell gathered more than a thousand runs in the shield matches alone, Queensland was thwarted in the last match of the season by a devastating spell from young New South Wales fast bowler Jeff Thomson. Learning of the bowler&#x27;s dissatisfaction with his home state, Chappell persuaded Thomson to move to Queensland for the following season. Chappell then departed for Australia&#x27;s first Test-playing tour of New Zealand. The Chappell brothers shattered records in the Wellington Test, as Ian and Greg scored centuries in both innings, the only such instance. Greg&#x27;s effort of 380 runs in a Test match (247* and 133) remained a record until beaten by Graham Gooch in 1990.

Unfortunately for Chappell, his health was now blighted by recurring tonsillitis and he found it difficult to bat for long periods during the 1974–75 Ashes series. He was the backbone of Australia&#x27;s sometimes inconsistent batting, scoring 608 runs at 55.3. At Sydney, where Australia won to reclaim the Ashes, Chappell dominated with 84 and 144, which he followed up with a century in a losing cause in the sixth Test at Melbourne. At Perth, he broke the world record for a fielder by snaring seven catches. Ironically, his grandfather Vic Richardson was one of several players who held the old record of six. Chappell reluctantly had his tonsils removed, but he quickly lost a lot of weight which affected his performance on the tour of England that followed. He played in the World Cup (for what proved to be the only time), then made only one good score (73* at Lords) in the four Ashes Tests that followed.

=== Australian captain (1975–1977) ===
Sufficiently recovered, Chappell totally dominated the season of 1975–76, amassing a record 1547 first-class runs at an average of 85.9, with five centuries. Appointed as Australian captain, Chappell began with a century in each innings to win the first Test against the West Indies in his adopted home town of Brisbane. This performance was unique in Test cricket at the time (later replicated by Virat Kohli of India in 2014). He led the team to an overwhelming 5–1 win and the title of unofficial world champions. His personal highlight was a classic 182* in the Sydney Test.

The peak of Australia&#x27;s form proved to be brief. The team lost a number of players to early retirement, mainly because remuneration was so poor. Chappell was able to parlay his position into a reasonable income with his Queensland contract and personal endorsements, but he still needed to develop business interests in life insurance outside the game. His leadership abilities were tested in the summer of 1976–77 as a number of new players were blooded and Jeff Thomson was laid low by long-term injury. Australia received much criticism for defensive play during a drawn series with Pakistan, but Chappell&#x27;s form was faultless, and he scored 121 and 67 in the only Test victory. The tour to New Zealand that followed was similar; it was clear Australia was in a rebuilding phase. During the Test at Auckland, a streaker appeared when Chappell was at the crease. Incensed by this new craze and the disruption that it caused, Chappell grabbed the man and hit his bare backside with the bat. When play resumed, the ensuing din from the incident caused Chappell to mis-hear his partner&#x27;s call for a run, and he found himself run out. For once, the Chappell concentration had been broken. But the most significant occurrence of this match occurred off-field: Chappell was approached to sign with a proposed break away competition, later to be known as World Series Cricket (WSC).

Chappell formally signed a WSC contract the following month, during the Centenary Test, a one-off match against England commemorating one hundred years of Test cricket. He was offered the most lucrative WSC contract in line with his age and high profile as captain of Australia. Chappell led Australia to a dramatic victory. Some of his players felt that he struggled to cope with the pressure of captaincy during the tense England run chase on the final day, when Australia won a dramatic victory, due to by a marathon bowling spell from Dennis Lillee. But Lillee&#x27;s absence for the forthcoming tour of England would hamper Chappell&#x27;s campaign to retain the Ashes.

News of the WSC break away was leaked early in the tour, and Chappell quickly found himself besieged. Tour officials and administrators back home questioned his loyalty, journalists were constantly looking for comment, while non-WSC players in the squad accused him of bias in team selections. Leading an inexperienced team in often inclement weather sapped his confidence, while the English bowlers, knowing that he was the key wicket, constantly put him under pressure. After a brave 44 and 112 failed to save the second Test at Manchester, his form fell away and the team slipped to a 0–3 loss.

 Chappell, who was a tremendous player of pace bowling, is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen ever to play for Australia. Although adept in all aspects of batting, he was especially noted as a strong player on the on side (or leg side) of the wicket. The English writer and commentator John Arlott wrote of him in 1977:

=== World Series Cricket (1977–1979) ===
Chappell was happy for brother Ian to captain the WSC Australian team, which allowed him to concentrate on his batting. In the first season of WSC, he returned to type with 661 runs at an average of 60. The Australians struggled against the array of talented players assembled to represent the West Indian and World teams, and the emphasis on fast bowling destroyed the confidence of many batsmen, who took to wearing helmets for safety. Chappell eventually opted for a helmet with temple guards only – he never wore one with a grille. He never missed an opportunity to slip into a cap when facing medium pace or spin.

In the final &quot;Supertest&quot; of the first season, Chappell captained the Australian team as his brother had suffered a broken finger. After four losses in five matches, the Australians turned matters around, thanks to a magnificent 246* by Greg Chappell, the highest innings played during the existence of WSC. However, the constant diet of fast bowling got to Chappell in the next season, and he managed to pass fifty in the Supertests just once. With a WSC tour of the West Indies looming, Chappell was diagnosed with Bell&#x27;s Palsy and one side of his face was paralysed. Doctors and family advised him to miss the trip, but Chappell was determined to go and utilise a modified technique he had devised for facing the relentless fast bowling.

After a slow start, Chappell hit the richest vein of form in his career. In quick succession, he peeled off 45 and 90 in Barbados, 7 and 150 in Trinidad, 113 in Guyana and finished his WSC career with 104 and 85 in Antigua, all scored against an attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft and Joel Garner on their home wickets. Unfortunately for Chappell, WSC matches are not included in official statistics as he scored five hundreds in 14 Supertests and a total of 1415 runs at 56.6 average. In all, he missed 24 Test matches during his exile from official cricket.

=== Post-WSC years (1979–1984) ===
When WSC players rejoined official cricket for 1979–80, there was plenty of debate over the Australian captaincy. Chappell was the far from unanimous choice, but led the Test team in twin series, against England (won 3–0) and West Indies (lost 0–2), and the first triangular ODI series where Australia failed to reach the final. It was a mixed bag of results and the programming came in for some criticism. Chappell led by example in scoring 74 and 124 in the Brisbane Test against the West Indies in his comeback to Test cricket. His 98* guided Australia to victory over England at Sydney, then 114 and 40* extracted a similar result at Melbourne. While he averaged 44 with the bat and claimed seven wickets in the ODIs, a constant shuffling of positions ensured an uneven Australian performance.

Despite protesting the strenuous nature of the players&#x27; workload in this new era, Chappell found himself leading the team to Pakistan two weeks after the end of the Australian season. Pakistan narrowly won the first Test, then prepared featherbed wickets for the remaining two matches. At Faisalabad, Chappell made 235 and as a protest at the pitch, allowed all eleven Australians to have a bowl in Pakistan&#x27;s innings – the first time this had happened in a Test since 1884. Australia lost the series 0–1. Later in the year, Australia played a second Centenary Test, this time to commemorate the first Test played in England, and the match (played at Lords) ended in a draw due to poor weather. One of only four players who played both matches, Chappell scored 47 and 59, but his best remembered contribution to the match was an attempted citizen&#x27;s arrest (along with England captain Ian Botham) of an MCC member who attacked one of the umpires in a very ill-tempered scene.

The 1980–81 season brought another three-way competition, this time with New Zealand and India. In the Tests, Australia had a convincing win over the Kiwis, but was held to a drawn series against India. Chappell was in good form throughout the summer, but managed only two international centuries. The first came at Sydney in an ODI against New Zealand, when Chappell set a then record Australian score of 138*. Early in the new year, on the same ground, he played his first Test against India. Despite suffering a bad stomach upset, Chappell hit 204, an innings described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;masterly&quot;. However, this season is best remembered for the triangular ODI series, specifically the third of the best of five finals series, played in Melbourne on 1 February 1981 (See #Underarm controversy, below).

Chappell experienced his only extended run of poor form during the 1981–82 Australian season, which featured Test and One Day matches against the West Indies and Pakistan. His 201 in the second test of the season, against Pakistan, was his only score of note and he registered seven ducks in total in the international matches, including four consecutive ducks spread across two Test matches and two One Day matches. Chappell&#x27;s average in the Test matches was 30.6 (13.6 without the double century) and his average in the One Day matches was 17.7.

From 1981 onwards, Chappell did not make himself available for most overseas tours. Thus Kim Hughes was captain for the 1981 and 1982 tours of England and Pakistan respectively, before Chappell was returned the captaincy for the Australian summers of 1981–82 and 1982–83. Chappell retired as captain in 1983, playing his last test series (1983–84) under Hughes as captain.

===Summary===

Chappell was batsman of the ODI team concurrently with his Test captaincy, registering 21 wins and 25 losses from 49 matches; all but four of these matches were after the end of World Series Cricket, and Chappell never captained Australia in a Cricket World Cup tournament. His batting exploits in ODIs were not quite of the same magnitude as his Test match career, but he did hold the Australian record single-innings score (138 not against New Zealand in 1980) for more than ten years. His ODI captaincy career is most commonly remembered for the &quot;underarm&quot; incident in 1981 (see below).

Chappell played his last Test match in January 1984, making 182 in his final innings. Thus, Chappell became the first Test batsman in history to score centuries in both his first and last Test innings. Of all the Test batsmen who have retired since 1974 and scored more than 2,000 Test runs, Chappell&#x27;s Test batting average of 53.86 is the third highest, behind Kumar Sangakkara (57.41) and Jacques Kallis (55.37). And if Chappell&#x27;s batting average in Kerry Packer&#x27;s &quot;Supertests&quot; (the hardest cricket Chappell says he ever played) were added to his test record, his overall average would be 54.30

==Controversies==

===Underarm bowling incident===
Chappell instigated the underarm bowling incident in the New Zealand–Australia One Day International on 1 February 1981. With the series tied at 1–1, Australia looked to have gained the upper hand by batting first and setting New Zealand a chase of 235 runs. Undisciplined bowling and fielding by the Australians, and a great innings from Kiwi opener Bruce Edgar narrowed the target to 15 with one over to play. Chappell&#x27;s younger brother, Trevor, a batting all-rounder who specialised in bowling at the end of an innings, delivered the final over. From the first five balls, Trevor Chappell took two for 8, leaving the new batsman (Brian McKechnie) to score a six to tie the game.

At this point, Greg Chappell intervened, told his brother to deliver the ball along the ground (i.e. underarm) and he then informed the umpire to let the batsman know of the change of bowling style. Despite the protestations of wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, the ball was delivered and the batsman simply put his bat in front of the ball to stop. He then hurled his bat away. A large crowd of 50,000 – mostly Australian – loudly booed the Australian team from the field. The New Zealand Prime Minister Rob Muldoon said it was &quot;the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket&quot;, the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said it was &quot;contrary to the traditions of the game&quot;, and the Chappells&#x27; decision was universally condemned. Both brothers have expressed regret and embarrassment over the incident.

===Ganguly spat===

Chappell&#x27;s first overseas tour as the coach of the Indian team was to Zimbabwe in September 2005. Sourav Ganguly, the Indian captain, scored a century in the first Test match and later alleged that coach Chappell had asked him to step down as captain on the eve of the game. This was widely covered by the Indian media. Ganguly was later dropped from the Indian cricket team by the selectors on the grounds of poor form, but many in the media suggested his omission was influenced by the previous row with Chappell.

===Book on Rahul Dravid===

In his new book, Chappell gave rise to fresh controversy by claiming that Rahul Dravid as captain didn&#x27;t receive the kind of support he gave to other captains and his success was not enjoyed by some of his teammates.

==Post-retirement==
===Selector===
====Australian selector 1984–88====
Shortly after Chappell retired from cricket he was appointed selector for the Australian team and also became a member of the Australian Cricket Board. This was a time of rebuilding for the national side, with many players lost through retirement and the South African rebel tours. He resigned from both positions in mid-1988, before the Australian team revived but by which time many key players in that revival had been selected, including David Boon, Geoff Marsh, Merv Hughes and Steve Waugh.

Among the decisions made by the panel when Chappell was a selector included encouraging Kim Hughes to resign, not selecting Hughes for the 1985 Ashes, trying Wayne Phillips, Greg Dyer and Tim Zoehrer as wicket-keepers, and fast-tracking Craig McDermott and Ian Healy into the national side.

====Australian selector 2010–11====
Chappell was made a selector of the Australian national side on 29 October 2010, replacing Merv Hughes. The &quot;Argus Review&quot; led to Chappell, along with selector Andrew Hilditch and coach Tim Nielsen, being sacked in August 2011. It emerged at the time that Chappell was banned from the Australian dressing room at the request of the players.

===Coach===
====South Australian coach====
From the late 1990s Chappell coached South Australia for five seasons during which time the team failed to win a single trophy.

====Pakistan consultant====

In 2004, he fulfilled a consultancy role for Pakistan&#x27;s National Cricket Academy

====Indian coach====

In May 2005, he was appointed coach of the Indian national cricket team for a two-year term until the World Cup 2007. He earned about US$175,000 as salary from the BCCI every year.

This role was the subject of much negative public and media commentary, for his tinkering with the batting lineup and his coaching methods. Several senior Indian players whom Chappell coached have come out to criticise his methods, including Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, and Zaheer Khan His comments also did not go down well with the Indian public. Ultimately, his coaching and methods came into question as India crashed out of the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the first round, the first time since the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Chappell resigned after reports that none of the senior players, including Tendulkar, were happy with him and his coaching methods. His rift with India&#x27;s captain Sourav Ganguly and poor performances of the team at the 2007 World Cup made Chappell a dark figure in the history of Indian Cricket.

Despite the popular perception that Chappell&#x27;s tenure as coach was an unsuccessful one, he had a hand in laying the foundations of the team that went on to win the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2011 Cricket World Cup. He handed debuts to Sreesanth, Munaf Patel and Suresh Raina, who were all part of India&#x27;s squad in the successful 2011 World Cup campaign. R. P. Singh, who was India&#x27;s top wicket taker with 12 scalps in their successful campaign for the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, and Robin Uthappa, another member of the winning squad, were also handed their debuts by Chappell. Sreesanth and Munaf were also part of the Indian squad for the 2007 World T20.

====Other====
Chappell has served as an academy coach for the Rajasthan Royals, and was hired as the All Stars Coach for the 2008 Twenty20 match against Australia. He also serves as the executive coach for a series of Cricket Summer Camps in the United States as part of Chappell Way.

===Commentator===

Chappell has worked as a cricket commentator for both Channel 9 and ABC radio.

==Personal life==
During the early part of his career, since being a cricketer was not yet a full-time profession, Chappell worked in a variety of jobs, including at a life assurance firm, an oil company, and as a promotions officer with Coca-Cola bottlers in Adelaide. He married Judith Elizabeth Donaldson, a schoolteacher from Bexley in New South Wales, in 1971. The couple had three children: older son Stephen was born in 1975, Belinda was born in 1977 just before Chappell&#x27;s departure for the 1977 Ashes tour, and younger son Jonathan was born in 1980. From an early age, Jonathan chose to pursue baseball, which his father and uncle had also played during their childhood, and played Minor League Baseball from 2004 to 2005.

Chappell was a vegan.

==Awards and recognition==
Chappell was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1979 New Year Honours. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Australia Day Honours for &quot;distinguished service to cricket as a leading player, captain, coach and administrator at the elite level, and to a range of charitable foundations&quot;.

Chappell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986.

In 2002, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.

<text>Rùm (), a Scottish Gaelic name often anglicised to Rum ( ), is one of the Small Isles of the Inner Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland, in the district of Lochaber. For much of the 20th century the name became Rhum, a spelling invented by the former owner, Sir George Bullough, because he did not relish the idea of having the title &quot;Laird of Rum&quot;.

It is the largest of the Small Isles, and the 15th largest Scottish island, and is inhabited by 40 people, all of whom live in the hamlet of Kinloch on the east coast. The island has been inhabited since the 8th millennium BC and provides some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. The early Celtic and Norse settlers left only a few written accounts and artefacts. From the 12th to 13th centuries on, the island was held by various clans including the MacLeans of Coll. The population grew to over 400 by the late 18th century but was cleared of its indigenous population between 1826 and 1828. The island then became a sporting estate, the exotic Kinloch Castle being constructed by the Bulloughs in 1900. Rùm was purchased by the Nature Conservancy Council in 1957.

Rùm is mainly igneous in origin, and its mountains have been eroded by Pleistocene glaciation. It is now an important study site for research in ecology, especially of red deer, and is the site of a successful reintroduction programme for the white-tailed sea eagle. Its economy is entirely dependent on NatureScot, a public body that now manages the island, and there have been calls for a greater diversity of housing provision. A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry links the island with the mainland town of Mallaig.

In 2024, the island was designated an International Dark Sky Sanctuary, the first such in Scotland and the second in Europe.

==Toponyms==

Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests that &quot;Rum&quot; is &quot;probably&quot; pre-Celtic, but may be Old Norse &quot;rõm-øy&quot; for &quot;wide island&quot; or Gaelic &quot;ì-dhruim&quot; () meaning &quot;isle of the ridge&quot;. Ross (2007) notes that there is a written record of &quot;Ruim&quot; from 677 and suggests &quot;spacious island&quot; from the Gaelic &quot;rùm&quot;. Mac an Tàilleir (2003) is unequivocal that Rùm is &quot;a pre-Gaelic name and unclear&quot;. In light of this, Richard Coates has suggested that it may be worth looking for a Proto-Semitic source for the name. This is because the British Isles were likely repopulated from the Iberian Peninsula following the last Ice Age. He proposes a name based on the Proto-Semitic root &quot;*rwm&quot;, a &#x27;height-word&#x27; as seen in Ramat Gan in Israel and Ramallah, Palestine. Rum would therefore mean something like ‘(island of) height&#x27; or &#x27;high island&#x27;.

The origins are therefore speculative, but it is known for certain that George Bullough changed the spelling to &quot;Rhum&quot; to avoid the association with the alcoholic drink rum. However, the &quot;Rhum&quot; spelling is used on a Kilmory gravestone dated 1843. In 1991 the Nature Conservancy Council of Scotland (the forerunner to NatureScot) reverted to the use of &quot;Rum&quot; without the &quot;h&quot;.

In the 13th century there may be references to the island as &quot;Raun-eyja&quot; and &quot;Raun-eyjum&quot; and Dean Munro writing in 1549 calls it &quot;Ronin&quot;. Seafaring Hebrideans had numerous taboos concerning spoken references to islands. In the case of Rùm, use of the usual name was forbidden, the island being referred to as &quot;Rìoghachd na Forraiste Fiadhaich&quot;—&quot;the kingdom of the wild forest&quot;.

The island was cleared of its indigenous population prior to being mapped by the Ordnance Survey, so it is possible that many place names are speculative. Nonetheless, the significant number of Norse-derived names that exist eight centuries after Viking political control ended indicate the importance of their presence on the island. Of the nine hamlets that were mapped in 1801, seven of the names are of Norse origin.

==Geography==

Rùm is the largest of the Small Isles, with an area of .
Kinloch is at the head of Loch Scresort, the main anchorage. Kilmory Bay lies to the north. It has a fine beach and the remains of a village, and has for some years served as the base for research into red deer (see below). The area is occasionally closed to visitors during the period of the deer rut in the autumn. The western point is the A&#x27; Bhrìdeanach peninsula, and to the southwest lie Wreck Bay, the cliffs of Sgorr Réidh and Harris Bay. The last is the site of the Bullough&#x27;s mausoleum. The family decided the first version was inadequate and dynamited it. The second is in the incongruous style of a Greek temple. Papadil (Old Norse: &quot;valley of the hermit&quot;) near the southern extremity has the ruins of a lodge built and then abandoned by the Bulloughs.

An 1801 map produced by George Langlands identified nine villages: Kilmory to the north at the head of Glen Kilmory, Samhnan Insir just to the north between Kilmory and Rubha Samhnan Insir, Camas Pliasgiag in the northeast, &quot;Kinlochscresort&quot;, (the modern Kinloch), Cove (Laimhrige at Bàgh na h-Uamha in the east), Dibidil in the southeast, Papadil in the south, Harris in the southwest and Guirdil at the head of Glen Shellesder in the northwest.

The island&#x27;s relief is spectacular, a 19th-century commentator remarking that &quot;the interior is one heap of rude mountains, scarcely possessing an acre of level land&quot;. This combination of geology and topography make for less than ideal agricultural conditions, and it is doubtful that more than one tenth of the island has ever been cultivated. In the 18th century average land rental values on Rùm were a third those of neighbouring Eigg, and only a fifth of Canna&#x27;s.

Mean rainfall is high at at the coast and in the hills. Spring months are usually the driest and winter the wettest, but any month may receive the highest level of precipitation during the year.

==Geology==

The main range of hills on Rùm are the Cuillin, usually referred to as the &quot;Rùm Cuillin&quot;, in order to distinguish them from the Cuillin of Skye. They are rocky peaks of gabbro, forming the Rum layered intrusion. Geologically, Rùm is the core of a deeply eroded volcano that was active in the Paleogene period some 60 million years ago, and which developed on a pre-existing structure of Torridonian sandstone and shales resting on Lewisian gneiss. Two of the Cuillin are classified as Corbetts: Askival and Ainshval, (Old Norse for &quot;mountain of the ash trees&quot; and &quot;hill of the strongholds&quot; respectively) and Rùm is the smallest Scottish island to have a summit above . Other hills include Hallival, Trollaval (&#x27;mountain of the trolls&#x27;), Barkeval, and Sgurr nan Gillean (Gaelic: &quot;peak of the young men&quot;) in the Cuillin and Ard Nev, Orval, Sròn an t-Saighdeir and Bloodstone Hill in the west. It is likely that only the higher peaks remained above the Pleistocene ice sheets as nunataks.
Hallival and Askival are formed from an extraordinary series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated at the base of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50 centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3 metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.

==History==
===Prehistory===
A site near Kinloch known as Farm Fields provides some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized hazelnut shells found there have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this hunter-gatherer community may have been to take advantage of the local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.

Examination of peat cores and pollen records indicates that soil erosion (suggesting clearance of woodland for agricultural purposes) was taking place in 3470 BC (the early Neolithic era); much later, from 2460 BC, evidence of arable cultivation exists. As the climate became damper, peat expanded its coverage at the expense of woodland, and post-glacial sea level changes left raised beaches around the coastline 18–45 metres above the present sea-level, especially between Harris and A&#x27;Bhrideanach; Bronze Age artefacts, such as barbed-and-tanged arrowheads typical of the Beaker People, have been found in the machair which replaced it.
There are prehistoric fort sites at promontories near Kilmory, Papadil and Glen Shellesder of uncertain date. These primarily consist of a wall dividing the promontory from the rest of the island, but at Kilmory, there is also a rampart with a hollow containing the traces of an interior structure. At Shellesder, the promontory contains the remains of three round stone-walled huts, one of which integrates with the dividing wall. A small number of cairns, again of uncertain date, are also located along the coast.

===Early Medieval Period===

In the sixth and seventh centuries, Irish missionary activity led by Columba established a Christian presence in the region. Beccan of Rùm (previously a monk at Iona) may have lived on the island (at Papadil), for four decades from 632, his death being recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; in 677. He is known to have been conservative on doctrinal matters and surviving examples of his poetry suggest a passionate personality. He wrote of Columba:
:In scores of curraghs with an army of wretches he crossed the long-haired sea.
:He crossed the wave-strewn wild region,
:Foam flecked, seal-filled, savage, bounding, seething, white-tipped, pleasing, doleful. 
Simple stone pillars, over tall, have been found at Kilmory and Bàgh na h-Uamha (&quot;bay of the cave&quot;), and may date from this period. The latter pillar in particular is inscribed with a slim cross having strong similarities to a motif in the late 6th century &quot;Cathach of St. Columba&quot;. The other pillar – at Kilmory – is slimmer (being wide, rather than ), but is inscribed with a more elaborate design, resembling a globus cruciger sitting in a chalice; on the back is a simple Latin Cross.

===Scandinavian settlement===
From 833, Norse settlers established the Kingdom of the Isles throughout the Hebrides. Despite being a dependency of the Norwegian king, practical authority rested with the MacSorley, following a revolt by their ancestor, Somerled; the strip from Uist to the Rough Bounds, which contained the Small Isles, was ruled by the MacRory branch of the MacSorley. The only archaeological evidence of a Norse presence on Rùm, to date, is a piece of carved narwhal ivory, dating from the MacRory era, which served as a playing token / draughtsman.

===Scottish control===

In 1266, the Treaty of Perth transferred the Kingdom of the Isles to the Scottish king. At the turn of the century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which theoretically now extended to Garmoran; nevertheless, the treaty expressly preserved the power of local rulers, turning the MacRory lands into the &quot;Lordship of Garmoran&quot;, a quasi-independent crown dependency, rather than an intrinsic part of Scotland.

After nearly a century, the sole MacRory heir was Amy of Garmoran, who married John of Islay, leader of the MacDonalds, the most powerful branch of the MacSorley. A decade later, John put Amy, a faithful wife, aside to marry Princess Margaret, thus depriving his eldest son, Ranald, of the ability to inherit the lordship and those MacDonald lands. As compensation, John granted the Lordship of the Uists to Ranald&#x27;s younger brother Godfrey, and made Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran, including Rùm.
In 1380, shortly after it was acquired by Ranald, John of Fordun indicates that Rùm was &quot;&quot;a wooded and hilly island&quot; &quot;with excellent sport, but few inhabitants&quot;. It is possible that during the early medieval period the island was used as a hunting reserve by the nobility; in Gaelic it was referred to as &quot;Rìoghachd na Forraiste Fiadhaich&quot; — &quot;the kingdom of the wild forest&quot;&quot;.

However, on Ranald&#x27;s death, Godfrey seized Garmoran, leading to an enormous amount of violence between him and Ranald&#x27;s heirs (Clan Ranald). In 1427, frustrated with the level of violence, King James I demanded that highland leaders should attend a meeting at Inverness. On arrival, many of the leaders were seized and imprisoned; some were killed. After a quick show trial of Godfrey&#x27;s heir, and in view of Clan Ranald being no less responsible for the violence, King James killed Alexander MacGorrie and declared the Lordship of Garmoran forfeit.

===Early modern period===
Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran remained with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship of it to John of Ross, the new MacDonald leader, who passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat. Clan Ranald objected to the transfer to Hugh, and appear to have retained some level of physical possession, regardless of whether they any legal authority to do so. The status of Rùm during this period is unclear, as surviving records do not mention it as part of Hugh&#x27;s possessions.

Alexander, the previous MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander&#x27;s aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained Rùm (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh&#x27;s gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a quitclaim of Clan Ranald rights from their leader, Allan, by giving them a galley; though the galley &quot;looked&quot; in good quality, the interior (so the legend says) was rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald&#x27;s refusal to accept John Garbh&#x27;s ownership of Rùm. John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, and held him prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.
In 1493, John Garbh&#x27;s heirs (the MacLeans of Coll) became direct vassals of the king, as a result of John MacDonald&#x27;s realm becoming forfeit. This brought them into conflict with the heirs of John Garbh&#x27;s elder brother (the MacLeans of Duart), who believed themselves to be the leaders of all MacLeans. In 1549 Donald Munro, conducting a survey, noted that although the island &quot;&quot;pertained&quot; to Coll it &quot;obeys instantlie&quot;&quot; to Duart, a situation that continued for some time.

Munro also reported that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with an abundance of deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principal home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.

When Lachlan Mor became leader of the MacLeans of Duart, he pursued the feud with vigour. In 1588, he had the fortune for some remains of the Spanish Armada to arrive in his lands (Mull); Lachlan offered them refuge in return for a supply of 100 soldiers. So it was that in 1588 Lachlan Mor attacked the Small Isles with the aid of Spaniards, and slaughtered its population, sparing neither women nor children. Rùm&#x27;s character as a hunting reserve, and the low numbers of its former population, meant that there was little long-term impact, once Rùm was repopulated. A contemporary, Skene, noted that

Romb is ane Ile of small profit, except that it conteins mony deir, and for sustentation thairof the same is permittit unlabourit, except twa townis. It is... all hillis and waist glennis, and commodious only for hunting of deir... and will raise 6 or 7 men.

The king imprisoned Lachlan (in Edinburgh) for his actions, but he escaped, and faced no further punishment. A later report for the king indicated that the island was repopulated by members of Clan Ranald

===Religious changes===
The MacLeans of Rùm and of Duart were mild supporters of the Scottish reformation, remaining Episcopalian, rather than becoming Presbyterian, and consequently the Roman Catholic church thought them susceptible to re-conversion. In 1622, the Irish church sent Cornelius Ward, a Franciscan friar, to bring Roman Catholicism back into the MacLean lands. Arriving on Rùm in 1625, Cornelius reported that it only had three villages; a few decades earlier the much smaller nearby island of Muck was recorded as having twice as many able men, suggesting that Rùm&#x27;s population had been deliberately constrained.

Cornelius had no luck with the MacLean leadership, who remained Episcopalian, but the (small) population of Rùm does appear to have become Roman Catholic again. In the rest of the nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, one of the most powerful Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl&#x27;s family.
In later generations, the lairds themselves became Presbyterian, preventing the island from becoming involved in the Jacobite risings, but it did ultimately bring a minor dispute to the island. In 1726, Presbyterianism was established in Rùm, quickly taking hold of the island&#x27;s population (there were only around 150 people living on Rùm at the time). Nevertheless, Rùm had no permanent Protestant minister, and when one visited, he was obliged to conduct sermons in the open air, there being no church building.

Half a century later, when visiting the wider region, Dr. Johnson was told that the laird had hit one of the tenants across the back with a gold-tipped cane, as punishment for going to Roman Catholic mass, threatening the same treatment for any others who did so. The Roman Catholic population of Eigg, an adjacent island, facetiously called Rùm&#x27;s Protestantism &quot;The Religion of the Yellow Stick&quot;.

===Population expansion===
The introduction of the potato as a food crop, in the 18th century, led to a rapid expansion of demand for arable land, which the populace also planted with barley. The increased health and fecundity this brought, and the lack of further wars, led to a population expansion; by 1801 there were nine hamlets on the island.

In turn, the increased demand for work led to new sources of income. Black cattle were raised for export to the mainland, and (more unusually) goats were kept by the inhabitants, the hair being sent to Glasgow and made into wigs for export to America. The economy was in no small part dependent on the bounty of the sea; Edward Clarke, visiting in 1797 dined on:

...milk, oatcakes and Lisbon wine. I was surprised to find wine of that species, and of a superior quality in such a hut, but they told us it was part of the freight of some unfortunate vessel wrecked near the island.
However, local agriculture was comparatively primitive, and the lack of lime restricted the ability to tan leather, or construct sophisticated buildings; the island was no more valuable than the much much smaller island of Muck. Furthermore, the new demands on the land had reduced the great forest island into an essentially treeless landscape; by the end of the century, this had caused the extinction of the native red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;).

The increase in the price of kelp, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, was the only thing keeping Rùm&#x27;s economy afloat. Inevitably, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, the kelp price collapsed, causing severe financial hardship. The laird himself was in additional difficulties as a result of having purchased the Isle of Muck during the peak of demand for kelp. He decided to evict the tenants, and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.

===Depopulation===

In keeping with the Highland Clearances that had swept Scotland since the 1750s, in 1825 the inhabitants of Rùm (then numbering some 450 people) were given a year&#x27;s notice to quit. The inhabitants of Rùm had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the land they worked, nor the houses in which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of the inhabitants boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively became known as the Highland Clearances. Harris was the largest settlement in the 18th century, which was cleared. It had 37 buildings.

In 1827, when giving evidence to a government select committee on emigration, an agent of the laird was asked &quot;&quot;And were the people willing to go?&quot;; &quot;Some of them&quot;, came the reply, &quot;Others were not very willing, they did not like to leave the land of their ancestors&quot;. Years later an eyewitness, a local shepherd, was more florid in his description of the events: &quot;The people of the island were carried off in one mass, for ever, from the sea-girt spot where they were born and bred... The wild outcries of the men and heart-breaking wails of the women and children filled all the air between the mountainous shore of the bay&quot;&quot;.
Lachlan turned Rùm into a sheep farm, with its population replaced by some 8,000 blackface sheep. So total had been the clearance that he was forced to import families to the island to act as shepherds. However, the prosperity elsewhere in the UK led to traditional staples like mutton and wool being of less interest to consumers, and their price fell. In 1839 the price of mutton fell dramatically, bankrupting Dr Lachlan, and forcing him to leave. Ironically, in the words of one of the emigrees, Dr Lachlan, &quot;&quot;the Curse and Scourge of the Highland Crofters&quot; was now &quot;much worse off than the comfortable people he turned out of Rùm 13 years previously&quot;.

In 1844 the visiting geologist, Hugh Miller, wrote:

The single sheep farmer who had occupied the holdings of so many had been unfortunate in his speculations, and had left the island: the proprietor, his landlord seemed to have been as little fortunate as his tenant, for the island itself was in the market; and a report went current at the time that it was on the eve of being purchased by some wealthy Englishman, who purposed converting it into a deer forest. How strange a cycle!

=== Multiple island owners===
In 1845, the MacLean laird sold the island to the Marquess of Salisbury, who converted Rùm into an estate for country sports. The Marquis first built a pier at Kinloch, and adjacent limekiln, to help with this process, re-introducing deer, both Red and Fallow. He then passed the land to his son, Viscount Cranbourne, who was more interested in fishing.
The main rivers of Rùm were essentially just trickling streams, so Cranbourne came up with a plan to increase the power of the Kinloch River, by diverting the other two. In 1849, he built a dam at the end of Loch Sgathaig, allowing him to diverting the overflow into the Kilmory River (northwards), rather than the Abhainn Rhangail (southwards). In 1852, he attempted to dam the Kilmory River, half a mile north of Loch Sgathaig, the plan being to send the overflow into the Kinloch River via a short canal; unfortunately &quot;Salisbury&#x27;s Dam&quot; collapsed shortly after being built.

In 1870, the island was sold to Farquhar Campbell, from Aros, a man keen on Rùm&#x27;s potential for shooting. In 1888, he decided to sell it; the sale prospectus described Rùm as &quot;the most picturesque of the islands which lie off the west coast of Scotland&quot; and &quot;as a sporting estate it has at present few equals&quot;&quot;. According to the sale documents, the population was between 60 and 70, all either shepherds or estate workers and their families. There were no crofts on the island.

In 1888 the island was sold to John Bullough, a cotton machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, who continued to use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Rùm therefore became part of the new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on Rùm, in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, felt that this was beneath his dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple, built in 1892 and designed by William James Morley. Argyll, similarly, was not thought fitting for Rùm, and that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.
John was succeeded as owner of Rùm by his son, George (later Sir George). George built Kinloch Castle in 1900 using sandstone quarried at Annan. The interior boasted an orchestrion that could simulate the sounds of brass, drum and woodwind, an air-conditioned billiards room, and a jacuzzi. A dam was built on Coire Dubh burn for hydroelectric purposes; the house was the first private home in Scotland, outside of Glasgow, to have an electricity supply.
At this time there were about 100 people employed on the estate. Fourteen under-gardeners, who were paid extra to wear kilts, worked on the extensive grounds that included a nine-hole golf course, tennis and squash courts, heated turtle and alligator ponds and an aviary including birds of paradise and humming birds. Soil for the grounds was imported from Ayrshire and figs, peaches, grapes and nectarines were grown in greenhouses.

This opulence could not be sustained indefinitely, and the Wall Street crash badly damaged the family finances, decreasing their interest in, and visits to, Rùm. Sir George died in France, in July 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, and was interred in the family mausoleum on Rùm. His widow continued to visit Rùm as late as 1954. When in 1957 Lady Bullough sold the whole island, including the Castle and its contents, to the Nature Conservancy Council, on the understanding that it would be used as a national nature reserve, the mausoleum was the only part of Rùm not included in the sale. Lady Bullough died in London, in 1967, at the age of 98; she was buried next to her husband in the Rùm mausoleum.

==Ecology==
Rùm is an important study site for research in ecology and numerous academic papers have been produced based on work undertaken on the island. In addition to its status as a National Nature Reserve, Rùm was designated a Biosphere Reserve from 1976 to 2002, a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1987, and has seventeen sites scheduled as nationally important ancient monuments.

===Fauna===

The red deer population has been the subject of research for many years, recently under the leadership of Tim Clutton-Brock of the University of Cambridge. These efforts are based at the remote bay of Kilmory in the north of the island. It has been important in the development of sociobiology and behavioural ecology, particularly in relation to the understanding of aggression through game theory. In November 2019 it was revealed that a 45-year study indicated that climate change had affected the gene pool of the red deer population on Rùm. Warmer temperatures resulted in deer giving birth on average three days earlier for each decade of the study. The gene which selects for earlier birth has increased in the population because hinds with the gene have more calves over their lifetime.
The island has small herds of ponies, feral goats (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;) and Highland cattle. The pony herd, which now numbers about a dozen animals, was first recorded on the island in 1772, and in 1775 they were described as being &quot;very small, but a breed of eminent beauty&quot;. They are small in stature, averaging only 13 hands in height and all have a dark stripe down their backs and zebra stripes on their forelegs. These features have led to speculation that they may be related to primitive northern European breeds, although it is more likely that they originate from the western Mediterranean. It is sometimes claimed that they are descended from animals that travelled with the Spanish Armada, although it is probable that they arrived by more conventional means. The goat stocks were improved for stalking in the early 20th century and acquired a reputation for the size of their horns and the thickness of their fleeces. The flock of about 200 spends most of its time on the western sea cliffs. The native cattle were re-introduced in 1970, having been absent since the 19th century clearances. The herd of 30 grazes in the Harris area from September to June, and further north in Glen Shellesder in the summer months.

Rùm is also noted for its bird life. The population of 70,000 Manx shearwater birds is one of the largest breeding colonies in the world. These migrating birds spend their winters in the South Atlantic off Brazil, and return to Rùm every summer to breed in burrows high in the Cuillin Hills. White-tailed sea eagles were exterminated on the island by 1912 and later became extinct in Scotland. A programme of reintroduction began in 1975, and within ten years 82 young sea eagles from Norway had been released. There is now a successful breeding population in the wild.

There are brown trout, European eel and three-spined stickleback in the streams, and salmon occasionally run in the Kinloch River. The only amphibian found on Rùm is the palmate newt and the only reptile native to Rùm is the common lizard. Invertebrates are diverse and have been studied there since 1884, numerous species of damselfly, dragonfly, beetle, butterflies, moths etc. having been recorded. Several rare upland species are found on the ultrabasic slopes of Barkeval, Hallival and Askival including the ground beetles &quot;Leistus montanus&quot; and &quot;Amara quenseli&quot;. The midge (&quot;Culicoides impunctatus&quot;), a biting gnat, occurs in &quot;unbelievable numbers&quot;.

In October 2006 the popular &quot;Autumnwatch&quot; series on BBC television showed coverage of the deer rut at Kilmory Bay.

A patch of brown earth soil at the abandoned settlement of Papadil is home to a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of &quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.

===Flora===
A tree nursery was established at Kinloch in 1960 in order to support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island&#x27;s flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book &quot;A Rum Affair&quot; by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.

===Protected and specialist areas===

Rum has a number of national and international conservation designations for its spectacular natural and built heritage, including:
* Rum National Nature Reserve (NNR)
* Special Area of Conservation (SAC)
* Special Protection Area (SPA)
* Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
* 7 Geological Conservation Review (GCR) Sites
* Rum is within the Lochaber Geopark
* Falls within the Small Isles National Scenic Area (NSA)
* 19 scheduled monuments (SAMs)
* The national nature reserve is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==Economy, transport and culture==

The entire island is owned and managed as a single estate by NatureScot. There are a variety of small businesses on the island including accommodation providers as well as artists and crafters. Most of the residents live in the hamlet of Kinloch, in the east of the island, which has no church, restaurant or pub. It has a village hall, general shop and a post office, which is run as a private business. A small church has been transformed into a school, which counts 5 pupils as of 2022. A cafe opens in summer. Rùm has broadband internet access, installed by a salmon farming company.

In general the island has a transient population comprising employees of NatureScot and their families, researchers, and a teacher. Until recently NatureScot was opposed to the development of the island as a genuine community, but there has been a change in approach since the beginning of 2007. Di Alexander, development manager for the Highlands Small Communities Housing Trust has said: &quot;It has been clear for many years that the small community on Rùm needs to increase and diversify its housing supply away from exclusively SNH-tied housing. Even a couple of new rented houses could make such a difference to the community&#x27;s wellbeing.&quot;

Surprisingly perhaps, on a estate with a population less than thirty, an issue has been lack of land for building. However, a spokesman for the agency has stated &quot;Once we are clear what the trust&#x27;s priorities are, we will release the land&quot;. 

In 2008 a &quot;Rùm Task Group&quot;, chaired by Lesley Riddoch, was created to generate proposals for advancing community development opportunities. It reported to Mike Russell MSP the Minister for Environment in the Scottish Government, and in June a plan was announced to establish a locally-run trust with the aim of reintroducing crofting settlements to the area around Kinloch village. In December it was announced that £250,000 of land and buildings were likely to be placed into community ownership, subject to a ballot of the electorate in January 2009. The transfer of 65 hectares of mixed land, three crofts, 10 domestic properties and eight non-domestic properties in and around Kinloch village to the Isle of Rum Community Trust took place in two phases in 2009 and 2010.

A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, , links Rùm and the neighbouring Small Isles of Canna, Eigg and Muck, to the mainland port of Mallaig some and hours sailing time away. The Lochnevis has a landing craft-style stern ramp allowing vehicles to be driven onto and off the vessel at a new slipway constructed in 2001. However, visitors are not normally permitted to bring vehicles to the Small Isles. During the summer months the islands are also served by Arisaig Marine&#x27;s ferry &quot;MV Sheerwater&quot; from Arisaig, south of Mallaig.
The best anchorage is Loch Scresort, with other bays offering only temporary respites from poor weather. Robert Buchanan writing in the 19th century described it as:
As sweet a little nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, about a mile in breadth, and curving inland for a mile and a half, it is quite sheltered from all winds save the east, being flanked to the south and west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes. In this sunny time, the sheep are bleating from the shores, the yacht lies double, yacht and shadow, and the bay is painted richly with the clear reflection of the mountains.

In the summer of 2002 a reality TV programme titled &quot;Escape from Experiment Island&quot; was filmed on the island. This short-lived show (six episodes) was produced by the BBC in conjunction with the Discovery Channel. The show was to piggyback on the success of &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot; by having the teams build vehicles to escape from the island.

In August 2020 it was announced that four new homes would be built in the village of Kinloch in an effort to attract more people to live on the island.

In 2024, the island was designated a Dark Sky Sanctuary, only the second such place in Europe to be a sanctuary, and the 23rd such place named in the world. The local effort, “a long meticulous bid”, by the Isle of Rùm Community Trust was led by one of the newer residents of the island, Alex Mumford, with Lesley Watt, Rum’s reserve officer, and the support of Steven Gray and James Green, two astronomers who started Cosmos Planetarium, a mobile theater on Rùm. This status may attract visitors wanting to enjoy the night sky, and the best season for viewing is October to March. The people living on Rùm have “dark-sky awareness“, which entails changes from typical daily life in the well-lit 21st century, specifically “no streetlights, light-flooded sports fields, neon signs, industrial sites or anything else casting a glow against the night sky.”

The natural darkness is important also for the breeding colony of Manx shearwater birds on Rùm. The view of the night sky on clear nights is impressive, showing the stars, the Milky Way, meteors, and the Aurora Borealis or its sheen. View with a telescope to see more. An observatory is planned for the near future.

== Demographics ==

Rùm is one of the most sparsely populated of all Scottish islands. There is no indigenous population; the residents are a mixture of employees of NatureScot and their families, together with a number of researchers and a school teacher.

In the 21st century, Rùm&#x27;s inhabitants have been seeking to attract more people to the island in order to boost their population. Their appeal has been successful, with several hundred applications being sent in response to their campaign. The island has witnessed a population explosion relative to its size. In August 2020, the population was estimated to be around 32. Less than a year and a half later, the number of inhabitants was estimated to be around 40.

==Climate==
As with the rest of the British Isles, Rùm features a strongly maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters.

There is a MetOffice weather station at Kinloch providing long term climate observations.

<text>Edward Ralph Dexter, (15 May 1935 – 25 August 2021) was an England international cricketer.

An aggressive middle-order batsman of ferocious power and a right-arm medium bowler, he captained Sussex and England in the early 1960s. He captained England in 30 test matches out of his 62 test match appearances.

He was known by the nickname Lord Ted. He is credited for his instrumental role in the formation of the modern ICC Player Rankings system. In June 2021, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the special inductees to mark the inaugural ICC World Test Championship final.

== Biography ==
Dexter was born in Milan in Italy, where his father Ralph Dexter ran a successful underwriting agency. He along with his family moved to England when he was aged three just before the start of World War II.

==Early career 1953–60==
&quot;Few batsmen, or writers, announce themselves as Dexter did when batting for Sussex against Surrey at the Oval last summer. His first ball, from the pavilion end, was slightly over-pitched on middle and leg. Feet moved fractionally, head hardly at all, but the bat swung the ball for six over long leg and they fetched it back from the seats under the gasholder.&quot;
:Wisden, 1961

Dexter was educated at Norfolk House, Beaconsfield, and Radley College, where he played in the first XI from 1950 to 1953, initially as a wicket-keeper and as captain in 1953, and was nicknamed &quot;Lord Ted&quot; by his coach Ivor Gilliat for his aloof self-confidence. His cricket coach at Radley was B H Smithson, father of England cricketer Gerald Smithson. While Dexter was head boy at Radley, Peter Cook, English comedian, satirist, writer and actor, was among those younger boys upon whom &#x27;a big &amp; strong&#x27; Dexter inflicted corporal punishment. He did his national service as a second lieutenant in the 11th Hussars during the Malayan Emergency in 1953–55 and was awarded the Malaya Campaign Medal. Dexter then entered Jesus College, Cambridge in October 1955, where he played golf and rugby in addition to winning his cricket Blue and playing in the University Match in 1956, 1957 and (as captain) 1958. 

He first came to notice as a bowler taking 5/8 and 3/47 for the Gentlemen in 1957 and joined Sussex County Cricket Club in the same year. He made his Test debut in 1958 against New Zealand, made 52 and E. W. Swanton thought that he should have been picked for Peter May&#x27;s MCC tour of Australia in 1958–59. In the end he was flown from Paris (where his wife was working as a model) to reinforce May&#x27;s injury-struck team. Dexter arrived in the middle of the tour, did not have time to acclimatize and although he did well in the tour matches he failed in the Tests. Continuing on the tour to New Zealand he made 141, his maiden Test century. After an indifferent summer against India the decision to take him to the Caribbean in 1959–60 was much criticised, but &quot;Lord Ted&quot; made his name thrashing the fast bowlers Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith with his powerful drives. He hit 132 not out in the First Test, 110 in the Fourth Test, made 526 runs (65.75), topping the England batting averages, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1961.

==Rising star 1960–61==
&quot;Few hundreds have filled such a yawning gap...Dexter so dominated a stand with Barrington that more than two-thirds of the 161 runs came from his masterful bat before he was stumped trying to lift Simpson&#x27;s leg-break on to some distant fairway.&quot;
:Ray Robinson and Mike Coward

On his return Dexter was made captain of Sussex, which he held until he retired in 1965. He had a quiet home Test season against South Africa, but in the First Test at Edgbaston in the 1961 Ashes series England started their second innings needing 321 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Dexter made 180, the biggest century for England against Australia since the war and studded with 31 cracking boundaries, but typically he was stumped in the last minutes of the match trying to hit Bobby Simpson for six so he could make a double century. In the famous Fourth Test at Old Trafford he played a spectacular innings of 76 in 84 minutes to take England to 106 runs from victory with 9 wickets in hand and the Ashes in sight, but his dismissal set off an England collapse and the series was lost.

==England captain 1961–62==
&quot;Ted was a man of moods, often caught up in theories, keen when the action was hot, seemingly uninterested when the game was dull...a big-time player, one who responded to atmosphere, liked action and enjoyed the chase and gamble. Maybe this was the reason he was drawn to horse racing; a dull day stalking the covers might be enlivened for him by thoughts of how his money was faring on the 3:15 at Ascot or Goodwood.&quot; 
:John Snow

With Peter May and Colin Cowdrey declining to tour India and Pakistan in 1961–62 Dexter was chosen to lead the MCC team. With a weakened team (Fred Trueman and Brian Statham also refused to tour) Dexter beat Pakistan 1–0 but lost to India 2–0, their first series victory over England. He made 712 Test runs (71.20) on the tour, including his highest Test score of 205 at Karachi, and another 446 runs (89.20) when Pakistan toured England in 1962 and were beaten 4–0. Peter May finally declared his retirement in 1962 and the selectors had to choose who would captain the English cricket team in Australia in 1962–63. Dexter captained England in the First and Second Tests against Pakistan, winning two big victories, but Colin Cowdrey was put in charge for the Third Test. Cowdrey had been May&#x27;s affable vice-captain, had a shrewd cricket brain and was seen as his natural successor, but had inherited his cautious tactics and the Marylebone Cricket Club was crusading for &quot;brighter cricket&quot;. Cowdrey withdrew from the final Gentleman v Players match at Lord&#x27;s because of kidney stones even though he had been appointed captain, which usually indicated the selectors&#x27; intentions. Dexter was put back in charge (and drew against Fred Trueman&#x27;s Players), but found another rival in the old Sussex captain the Reverend David Sheppard, who was willing to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia. Sheppard made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Dexter was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the home series and the forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand with Cowdrey as vice-captain. The general opinion was that England had a good batting side, but their bowling was unvaried, would struggle to dismiss Australia and that the tourists would be lucky to avoid another defeat.

==Tour of Australia and New Zealand 1962–63==
&quot;After his thunderous Melbourne display Dexter was a magnet; the first thing people wanted to know about a team selection was: &quot;Is Dexter playing?&quot;...Batting against South Australia, he lifted the ball onto the high roof of the members stand – a tremendous hit. Some of his drives along the ground just could not be stopped, even when they went straight to a fieldsman.&quot;
:Tom Goodman
He made 481 runs (48.10), the most runs by an England captain in Australia, and this remains a record. The team manager was Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, GCVO, PC, Earl Marshal and Chief Butler of England, and it was joked that &quot;Lord Ted&quot; could only be controlled by a duke. In fact, the Duke was the President of Sussex County Cricket Club, had been instrumental in Dexter&#x27;s appointment as county captain, shared his interests in horse racing and golf and was very popular with the Australian public. In the tour match between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and an Australian XI Dexter hit 102 in 110 minutes, including 2 sixes and 13 fours. John Woodcock of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote &quot;I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely to forget it. Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards.&quot; At the Adelaide Oval Dexter included &quot;a six from a gigantic hit onto the roof of the stand – one of the biggest hits ever seen at the ground.&quot; He was the main draw in the England team and over a million spectators came to see the tourists, the most since 1936–37. The tour returned a record profit for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) of £24,000, beating the £17,000 of 1946–47. Dexter continued his good run of form to equal Patsy Hendren&#x27;s England record of six consecutive Test 50s (85 and 172 against Pakistan and 70, 99, 93 and 52 against Australia), which he soon shared with Ken Barrington and more recently Alastair Cook. His powerful innings enlivened the First and Second Tests and gave England a 1–0 lead in the series. Australia came back to win the Third Test at Sydney, where Dexter had preferred to keep his fast bowling attack from the Second Test even when Fred Trueman volunteered to stand down in favour of a second spinner to Fred Titmus. In the end the unsupported Titmus took 7/79 in the first innings and Australia won by 8 wickets, E. W. Swanton and others thought that if either David Allen or Ray Illingworth had been in the team England would have won the Ashes. Even so, the match might have been saved if Dexter had not conceded 27 runs off 26 balls so that the teams would not have to return the next day to finish the game. The last few overs were played in the rain and it rained for most of the fifth day, so England might have won the Ashes. Dexter&#x27;s negative field placings and lack of urgency failed to regain the Ashes and the painful draws in the Fourth and Fifth Tests particularly spoilt the atmosphere, as Richie Benaud was determined to hold onto the Ashes and Dexter was content to draw a series in Australia. In mitigation the Adelaide pitch was flat as a pancake. The Sydney ground was so saturated in the days before the match that mowing was impossible before the start. The &quot;square&quot; was like one large bunker and the outfield like a meadow. Barely a ball reached the boundary. Benaud was an advocate of &quot;go ahead&quot; captaincy and Dexter for &quot;brighting up&quot; cricket and their reputations were unfairly tarnished.

==Home series 1963–64==
&quot;Ted Dexter elected to lead from the front. We had a disastrous start, with Charlie Griffith blasting out both our openers very cheaply, and Ted unleashing one of his finest displays of controlled aggression I have ever witnessed. His 70 was electrifying. He stood up and hit the quick bowlers all over the show for an hour.&quot;
:Fred Titmus

As captain against Frank Worrell&#x27;s West Indian cricket team in England in 1963 Dexter was able to loosen up after the Ashes and they played an exciting Test series. After losing the First Test, in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s England&#x27;s first innings rested heavily on Dexter&#x27;s hard-hitting 70 off 75 balls when he took on the West Indian fast bowlers Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall in an innings that was remembered by all who saw it. In the second innings Colin Cowdrey came out to bat with a broken arm with victory, defeat or a tie still possible in the last two balls, but David Allen blocked them for a draw. England levelled the series in the Third Test thanks to Dexter (4/38 and 1/7) and Fred Trueman (5/75 and 7/44), but lost the last two Tests and the series. In 1964 Dexter was again in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Famously in the decisive Third Test at Headingley he removed the off-spinner Fred Titmus after he had taken three wickets to reduce Australia to 187/7, still 81 runs behind England. Dexter took the new ball and gave it to Fred Trueman who bowled a series of bouncers which Peter Burge hooked and pulled to 160, hoisting Australia to 389 and a 7 wicket win. Although the change made sense as the new batsman Neil Hawke was fragile against fast bowling and Trueman, the greatest wicket-taker in the world at the time, was playing on his home ground Dexter was heavily criticised for a decision which obviously lost the series. In the Fourth Test Australia made 656/8, but thanks to a stand of 246 between Ken Barrington (256) and Dexter (174) England reached 611 and avoided defeat. It was the first time that two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in a Test, and their fortunes gripped the cricketing nation, but the inevitable draw meant that Australia retained the Ashes. As some consolation Dexter led Sussex to the finals of the Gillette Cup in 1963 and 1964, and won both, the first trophies in the county&#x27;s history.

==Later career 1965–72==
&quot;Above all we had Dexter&#x27;s captaincy. One-day cricket was his kind of game: it was instant and aggressive and its atmosphere brought out the best in him. He really became involved, more so than in county games. He even made a marked difference to our one day performances when he returned for a season of Sunday League games in the early 1970s.&quot;
:John Snow

Dexter declared himself unavailable for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa as he contested Jim Callaghan&#x27;s Cardiff South East seat for the Conservative Party in the 1964 General Election. Finding himself free to tour after his defeat he was made vice-captain to M. J. K. Smith, who won the series and continued as captain. His cricket career was virtually ended by an accident in 1965. His Jaguar car ran out of petrol in west London, and he was pushing it to safety when it pinned him to a warehouse door, breaking his leg. He left Sussex and played occasional Sunday games with the International Cavaliers, and made 104 when they defeated the 1966 West Indians by 7 wickets. He returned briefly in 1968, making 203 not out in his comeback match against Kent, but failing in the 1968 Ashes series. He played Sunday League games for Sussex in 1971 and 1972.

==Administration 1989–2003==
&quot;If you are going to lose, you might as well lose good and proper and try to sneak a win.&quot;
:Ted Dexter

Dexter retired from cricket to concentrate on other interests in 1968, remaining a journalist, becoming a broadcaster and founding a PR company. In the late 1980s he joined Bob Willis to find new fast bowlers for English cricket. Sponsored by a brewery, application forms were sent to pubs to encourage young men, but most were filled in by jokers and drunks and only a few potential candidates were discovered. These were trained with javelin throwing and other exercises to strengthen their back and arm muscles, but the only bowler in the scheme who played first-class cricket had been signed up by Warwickshire before its inception. The plan therefore failed even though it generated much publicity and showed a certain amount of imagination and initiative.

In 1987, Dexter had the idea of developing a ranking system for Test cricketers. He developed the system with statisticians Gordon Vince and Rob Eastaway, and it was launched as the Deloittes Ratings. The Ratings steadily gained credibility, and were formally adopted by the International Cricket Council in 2003, and have become the official ICC Player Rankings. In an article in &quot;The Cricketer&quot; magazine in 2005, Dexter was quoted as saying: &quot;The rankings idea was my biggest contribution to cricket. Much better than being known for hitting a couple of extra-cover drives.&quot; Former cricketer and analyst Simon Hughes in his bibliography titled &quot;And God Created Cricket&quot; noted that Dexter&#x27;s ideas had shaped modern cricket.

In 1989 he succeeded Peter May as Chairman of the England Cricket Selectors, receiving a modest £18,000 pay to compensate for his lost newspaper contract, the first chairman to be paid. &quot;Dexter was soon in action, initially by way of press conferences and then, as the season developed, by lightning visits to the county grounds. These he made, despite an operation to a heel that put him for a while on crutches, by motorbike and car, a demonstration of enthusiasm and interest that was impressive.&quot; After the chaos of 1988 – the so-called Summer of Four Captains – he wanted the tough Mike Gatting as captain, but was vetoed by Ossie Wheatley and his status was immediately undermined. Instead the more relaxed David Gower was appointed for the six-Test series. Dexter tackled the role with energy and enthusiasm, but the shine soon wore off as Allan Border&#x27;s 1989 Australians beat England 4–0 to regain the Ashes, their first series victory in England since 1975. His cause was not helped by the announcement of the Mike Gatting&#x27;s rebel tour of South Africa in the middle of the series, which removed more than fifteen England players from contention. Admittedly England were already 2–0 down in the series and none of these players had shown any talent so far in the summer, but it was an indication of the division and demoralisation of English cricket. In the First Test at Headingley Dexter selected four fast bowlers and no spinners for the team, advised Gower to put Australia in to bat, only to see them make 601/7 and win by 210 runs. For the Second Test he wrote an inspirational hymn for the England cricketers to sing called &quot;Onward Gower&#x27;s Soldiers&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;) and appointed a team chaplain, but remained aloof from the players and seldom visited the dressing room. At the end of the summer he told the press that he couldn&#x27;t think of any mistakes he had made and later joked that the &quot;lines of Venus were in the wrong juxtaposition&quot;, which was incorrectly interpreted by the press as a genuine belief in New Age mysticism. The lackadaisical Gower was fired at the end of the summer and the more painstaking Graham Gooch was made captain until 1993, despite Dexter having called his previous appointment as captain as &quot;being hit in the face by a dead fish&quot;.

Dexter&#x27;s tenure as Chairman of Selectors coincided with a poor period in English cricket, but there were some successes; these included the first Test victory over the West Indies for 16 years in 1990, victories over New Zealand and India in the run-laden summer of 1990, and the 2–2 draw with the West Indies in 1991. Against this England suffered two further series defeats to Australia (3–0 in 1990–91 and 4–1 in 1993), and were heavily defeated 3–0 in India in 1992–93, after Gower was controversially dropped from the team. Dexter resigned under a cloud at the end of 1993, but his overhaul of the antiquated structure of English cricket and forward-looking reforms such as the change from three- to four-day county cricket had a significant impact. Richie Benaud commented that the structures he put in place &quot;will be of great of benefit to English cricket in years to come. Equally, I&#x27;m in no doubt that others will take the credit for it.&quot; He also became president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and was chairman of the MCC&#x27;s cricket committee until 2003, when he was replaced by Tony Lewis. He was also Chairman of the MCC&#x27;s &quot;England Committee&quot;, which was an administrative role and was awarded the CBE in the 2001 New Year Honours.

==Style==
&quot;Dexter&#x27;s power amazed everyone who had not had the joy of watching him in other innings in England and in Perth. He took chances – thank goodness for those who look on batting as a challenge! – but he made superb strokes, with his driving tremendous in power and placement. Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn&#x27;t matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas&#x27;s legs just as he got his hands there. I felt glad that the ball went between his legs and that his hands were not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.&quot;
:Johnnie Moyes
Ted Dexter was a cavalier batsman in the old amateur style and a ferocious strokemaker, but was known as being moody and mercurial. As a batsman he could leave the hands of the fielders team bruised and reddened with his powerful drives and cuts. To see &quot;Lord Ted&quot; thrashing the fast bowling was one of the most thrilling sights in cricket and he could make any run chase look possible. His great fault was that he seldom gave a bowling attack due respect and got himself out with rash strokes. Though more a batsman than a bowler he could seam and swing the ball, was a useful third paceman even at Test level and was an excellent fielder anywhere. Dexter was a natural one-day player, where his big hitting, tidy bowling, keen fielding and lively captaincy gave Sussex their first two trophies – the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963 and again in 1964. He devised innovative field placings for limited overs games and his &#x27;ideas changed the game forever. It is no exaggeration to say that Dexter was the man who shaped modern cricket&#x27;. In first-class matches he bored easily and his strokes of genius were in the end outweighed by his mistakes. As captain he had &quot;more theories than Charles Darwin&quot;, sometimes shifting fielders on a whim and was hailed as a genius if a wicket fell as a result. He was dictatorial on the field, rarely consulting with his bowlers about field placings and pulling them off by saying &quot;You&#x27;ve had enough now. Get down to third man&quot;

==Outside cricket==
Dexter married Susan Longfield on 2 May 1959 . She was the daughter of a former Kent cricketer Tom Longfield, whom he met at a party at Cambridge University while still an undergraduate and decided to marry on sight. She worked as a model and she joined her husband on the tour of Australia in 1962–63, where she generated considerable press interest and earned more than any of the cricketers. Fred Trueman recalled; &quot;Ted Dexter&#x27;s wife arrived in Australia. Ted&#x27;s wife was a looker and a model. She is a very lovely lady, but on hearing of her arrival, when Ted faced the press, the majority of questions posed were about his wife...during an England cricket team press conference!&quot;. They had a son Thomas and a daughter Genevieve.

Dexter was a talented golfer, an amateur champion, and some believe could have achieved success in that sport if he had not chosen cricket. In Australia in 1962–1963 he played a foursome with Norman Von Nida, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player (with Colin Cowdrey as his caddy) and they offered to take him to America to become a tournament golfer, but Dexter declined. He also went on to win the President&#x27;s Putter three times in his career.

Dexter owned Jaguar cars, Norton motorbikes, greyhounds, race horses and in 1970 piloted his Aztec BPA-23 &quot;Pommies Progress&quot; to Australia with his family to cover the Ashes as a journalist, covering 12,000 miles and making 24 stops. 

Dexter launched his own PR company, which ran for many years and briefly became a television cricket commentator, alongside Richie Benaud and Denis Compton. He wrote a weekly column on cricket for The Observer, and then, more lucratively, for the Sunday Mirror.

His fondness for horse racing exceeded even that of Gary Sobers and Brian Close. He carried a then rare portable television to watch races in cricket dressing rooms and once declared a Sussex innings from Brighton Racecourse.

He co-wrote with Clifford Makins the crime novel &quot;Testkill&quot; (1976) where an Australian bowler is murdered during play at a Test match against England at Lord&#x27;s.

In December 2012, on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, Dexter appeared with Paul Atterbury, a life-long fan. Dexter talked about his father&#x27;s Military Cross, which had subsequently been stolen.

== Death ==
Dexter died on 25 August 2021 at the age of 86 in Wolverhampton due to an age-related illness. He left a widow Susan (whom he married in 1959), a son, daughter and several grandchildren. In a statement following his death, Marylebone Cricket Club described him as &quot;one of England&#x27;s greatest ever cricketers&quot;. England players wore black armbands as a tribute during the second day of the third test match of the series between India and England at Headingley.

<text>New York Bay is the large tidal body of water in the New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary where the Hudson River, Raritan River, and Arthur Kill empty into the Atlantic Ocean between Sandy Hook and Rockaway Point.

==Geography==
New York Bay is usually divided into two major components, which are connected by the Narrows. They are Upper New York Bay and Lower New York Bay. 

The term New York Harbor usually refers to Upper New York Bay and the surrounding Port of New York and New Jersey, but sometimes is taken to be a synonym for New York Bay.

Upper New York Bay includes several islands. Liberty Island is the location of the Statue of Liberty. Nearby Ellis Island is known as a former immigration station. Governors Island is a former military base, now a park and historic site. Robbins Reef Light is also in the upper bay. Lower New York Bay includes Hoffman Island and nearby Swinburne Island. Both are artificial islands that are closed to the public.

==History==
Commissioned by King Francis I of France, the Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano is the first European to discover the Bay in 1524. He gave it the name of New Angoulême, in honor of the King who was also Count of Angoulême.

<doc id="413146" wikidata="Q1099153" url="?curid=413146" title="Clavinet">
<text>The Clavinet is an electric [[clavichord]] invented by Ernst Zacharias and manufactured by the Hohner company of Trossingen, West Germany, from 1964 to 1982. The instrument produces sounds with rubber pads, each matching one of the keys and responding to a keystroke by striking a given point on a tensioned string, and was designed to resemble the Renaissance-era clavichord.

Although originally intended for home use, the Clavinet became popular on stage, and could be used to create electric guitar sounds on a keyboard. It is strongly associated with the musician Stevie Wonder, who used the instrument extensively, particularly on his 1972 hit &quot;Superstition&quot;, and was regularly featured in rock, funk and reggae music throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Modern digital keyboards can emulate the Clavinet sound, but there is also a grass-roots industry of repairers who continue to maintain the instrument.

==Description==
The Clavinet is an electromechanical instrument that is usually used in conjunction with a keyboard amplifier. Most models have 60 keys ranging from F1 to E6.

The sound is produced by a harp of 60 tensioned steel strings placed diagonally below the key surface. Each key pivots on a fulcrum point at the rear, with a spring to return it. Beneath each key, a metal holder grips a small rubber pad. Pressing a key forces the pad to fret the string like a hammer on on a guitar. An electro-magnetic pickup turns the string vibration into an electric current. The feel of a clavinet comes from the impact of the pad striking its anvil point against the string. This makes the keyboard weighted which allows a different volume for each note like a piano and clavichord, along with aftertouch as the string is stretched.

The end of each string farthest from the pick-ups passes through a weave of yarn, which damps the vibrating string after a key is released. Each string is tuned by a machine-head positioned along the front of the harp. This harp mechanism is different from the other Hohner keyboard instruments, the Cembalet and Pianet, which have pads plucking metal reeds. Most clavinets have two sets of pickups encased in epoxy in a plastic case, positioned above and below the strings. These are conceptually similar to a neck and bridge pickup on a guitar. The Clavinet has pickup selector switches, and a solid state preamplifier that allows a line level output to be fed to an amplifier. The volume of the preamplifier can be set by a control to the left of the keyboard.

==Background==
The Clavinet was designed by German engineer Ernst Zacharias. He grew up listening to Bach harpsichord music, which led him to design a comparable modern instrument. He joined Hohner in 1954, at a time when it was struggling with manufacturing after the company factories had been seized by the Nazis during World War II.

Zacharias revitalised the company&#x27;s product range, introducing the Cembalet and Pianet. He was particularly interested in producing an electric clavichord, and discovered that striking a hammer tip across a string mounted on an anvil allowed the player to hit the keys more forcefully and gain greater volume. He was interested in using metal keypads and plastic keys as an alternative to wooden frames and action that had been used on electric pianos such as the Wurlitzer. The first prototype model, the Claviphon, was manufactured in 1961. It used the string harp found on later production models, with a Pianet keyboard.

==Models==
Seven different models of the Clavinet were produced from 1964 to 1982. Originally, Hohner intended the instrument for home use and for late Medieval, Baroque and early classical music. The changes reflected Hohner&#x27;s transition from marketing it as a home instrument to one that was practical to play on stage. Around 38,000 units were manufactured in total.

===1960s===

The Clavinet I was the first model to be introduced in 1964. It is housed in a heavy brown teak veneer box with a bronze front panel stating the model number, covering the tuning pegs on the front. The panel can be removed with two thumb screws in order to tune the instrument with a rectangular case profile. A lockable lid can be folded over the keyboard when the instrument is not being played. The instrument is supported by four wooden legs fitted to the main body by threaded knobs, and secured with a crossbar brace. There is a built-in battery-powered speaker and amplifier, but there also the option to use an external amplifier via a jack socket. The only controls on the Clavinet I are volume and two tablet switches that selected a relevant combination of pickups. A bent rod music stand pegs into two holes on the upper surface. This model was designed and marketed as a home model for Baroque music. Early advertisements from Hohner featured the instrument in such a setting.

The Clavinet II had the same basic features as the Clavinet I, which replaced the built-in amplifier and speaker system with a preamplifier. It was the first model to support changing the instrument&#x27;s tone via rocker switches.

The Clavinet C was introduced in 1968. It has a slimmer case than the I or II, and is finished in red vinyl, which was popular with contemporary combo organs at the time. A removable black aluminium panel below the keys provides access to the tuning machines. The upper surface of the keyboard is finished in white, and a slot holds an acrylic panel music rest, with the Hohner logo. Four black tapered tubular steel legs are threaded into mounts on the underside of the case. The legs fit into a box section under the top surface for transport. A removable transport lid fastens over the keyboard and controls. As well as mains power, the instrument could be driven off a 9V battery. A rare variant of the C, known as the Echolette Beat Spinett featured reverse-colour keys like a traditional harpsichord, and an integrated ashtray.

The clavinet L was also introduced in 1968. This was a domestic model with a trapezoid-shaped case and three wooden legs. The keyboard has reverse-colour keys, and a clear plastic music stand. It has a built-in amplifier and speaker which run off four 1.5V batteries. This model was designed to resemble a typical Renaissance-era keyboard.

===1970s===
The Clavinet D6, introduced in 1971, continued the case style of the C but is covered in black vinyl leathercloth and the upper surface of the instrument is teak veneer, which was cheaper to manufacture. The instrument came with a removable lid used for transporting, which also had space to store the music stand. The D6 allowed a more versatile sound election, which could be selected by six rocker switches to the left of the keyboard. The left four switches are concerned with tone; &quot;Brilliant&quot; and &quot;Treble&quot; activate a high-pass filter, while &quot;Medium&quot; and &quot;Soft&quot; activate a low-pass filter. The two right switches are marked &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot; and control which pickups are selected. On the right was a mechanical mute slider.

The final E7 and Clavinet Duo models reflected several engineering improvements to make the instrument more suitable for loud stage use, including improved shielding to avoid electrical noise. The E7 was introduced in 1979. It has a black vinyl leather cloth covered case with a rectangular profile with rounded corners and a removable metal lid to protect the keys and control surface for transport. The control panels at the left hand end of the instrument include those found on a D6 along with a sliding volume control. It included support brackets so it could be mounted on the rounded top of a Rhodes Piano, a popular combination of keyboards at the time. A number of D6-labeled instruments were made in the E7-style case and include D6 logos on the control panel and the removable tuning cover. These are known as D6-N models, the &quot;N&quot; denoting &quot;new&quot;.

The Clavinet Duo model was first produced in 1978. It combined a clavinet with the Hohner Pianet T in one compact, albeit heavy, instrument. A foot switch allows the player to switch between clavinet, pianet, or a mixture or the two. There is also a &quot;split keyboard&quot; mode that allows either instrument to be used in a particular range of notes. There is a stereo output jack, that allows either a mix of the two sounds or each individual sound on one half of the stereo channel. It used a black case in the style of a Clavinet E7.

By the time the E7 and Clavinet Duo were being produced, polyphonic synthesizers had become popular, and electromechanical keyboards were beginning to fall out of fashion. The final models were manufactured in 1982.

===Later models===
After Hohner stopped producing electro-mechanical clavinets, they used the brand name for electronic and digital keyboards. The &quot;Clavinet DP&quot; was applied to a range of digital pianos. Though Zacharias approved of the instrument, they were designed for the home market, and made no attempt to emulate the original.

==Effects==
The Castle Bar is an aftermarket device invented by Buddy Castle in the mid-1970s that connects the strings to a rotating bridge, which is fixed to a rod on top of the instrument. This makes it possible to bend the pitch, in a similar manner to a tremolo arm on a guitar, by pressing the rod. The Clavinet can then be used in a very different manner, and it makes it a suitable lead instrument. There are upgraded reissues of the device available which are more reliable than the original.

The Clavinet is often played through a wah wah pedal or fed through an auto wah box. This is a particularly popular setup when playing funk. Other suitable stomp boxes that can be used with a Clavinet include phaser or chorus.

==Maintenance==
The early Clavinet I and II models were not designed for stage use, and would easily cause audio feedback if plugged into a loud amplifier. Later models such as the D6 resolved this issue with better string damping. The pickups are unshielded, which increases the likelihood of picking up interference from nearby lights, switches and transformers.

Over time, the rubber hammer tips deteriorated, resulting in the key no longer functioning properly. The strings can last longer than those on a guitar, as they are sealed instruments and not prone to oil and sweat from fingers. The keys are not the same as any other Hohner instrument, and replacement is only possible by taking them from a similar model.

In the 1980s and 1990s replacement parts for clavinets became harder to find, as Hohner had ceased to support them, and the price for second-hand models dropped. In 1999, Clavinet enthusiast Aaron Kipness established the website clavinet.com, and started manufacturing replacement hammer tips with his stepfather. The website quickly became popular with worldwide orders for replacement parts. Subsequently, Hohner asked Kipness if he would be interested in buying all remaining stock. The website encouraged other people to begin to manufacture spares, and there is now a cottage industry around keeping the Clavinet in playing condition. In 2018, a Clavinet in pristine condition could sell for about $2,000.

==Clones==
Though some musicians insist on using a real Clavinet, many modern keyboards provide a suitable emulation. The Nord Stage features the various pickup switch combinations, but not the mute slider. Ticky Clav 2 is a software emulation of the instrument, providing all the features found on the original boards.
==Notable users==
===Stevie Wonder===
The Clavinet is strongly associated with Stevie Wonder, particularly his 1972 number-one hit &quot;Superstition&quot;, where it provides the main riff and accompaniment to the song. The track features multiple Clavinet C overdubs, and requires Wonder and another keyboardist to play on two Clavinets simultaneously to recreate the arrangement in live performances. Wonder began to use Clavinets in the late 1960s, when he was looking for a keyboard that could play guitar-like sounds. He first used it on &quot;Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day&quot; (1968). As well as &quot;Superstition&quot;, other tracks such as &quot;Higher Ground&quot; are led by the Clavinet played through a Mu-Tron III filter pedal, and the album &quot;Talking Book&quot; makes prominent use of the instrument. The track &quot;Sweet Little Girl&quot; (on 1972&#x27;s &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;) features the line &quot;You know your baby loves you, more than I love my Clavinet&quot;.

By the 1970s, Hohner began to use photos of Wonder in their advertising. He has continued to record and tour with the Clavinet into the 21st century, and has several models. His main stage instrument is a customised D6 with modified preamps and high-quality film capacitors. The D6 is powered by a 9V battery instead of mains power, as it avoids ground loops and associated noise.

===Others===
In 1975, keyboardist Dave MacRae played the clavinet on Bill Oddie&#x27;s song &quot;The Funky Gibbon&quot; performed by The Goodies. Oddie recalled that MacRae&#x27;s playing had a &quot;very Stevie Wonder-type feel to it ... And then I literally started whacking the top of the grand piano. So the actual rhythm-track of &#x27;The Funky Gibbon&#x27; has only got me and Dave on it.&quot;

The Clavinet was used in funk music, often played through a wah-wah pedal. It can be heard on Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Use Me&quot; and Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;A Joyful Process&quot;. Billy Preston used a Clavinet on several songs, such as his own &quot;Outa-Space&quot; (1972) and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)&quot; (1973). Herbie Hancock featured the Clavinet prominently on the albums &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (1973) and &quot;Man-Child&quot; (1975), and both he and Chick Corea regularly played the instrument.

The first reggae recording to feature the Clavinet was the Termites&#x27; &quot;Attractive Girl&quot; (1967). Bob Marley and the Wailers&#x27; &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; (1980) is driven by a Clavinet riff played by Earl Lindo, as is Wonder&#x27;s Marley-influenced track &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin&#x27;)&quot;, played by Wonder himself.

The Band&#x27;s Garth Hudson played a Clavinet fed through a wah-wah pedal on &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; (1969). Keith Emerson played the instrument on Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s cover of &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;, heard on 1971&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;. George Duke regularly used a Clavinet when playing with Frank Zappa and solo, using the Castle Bar modification. Peter Hammill used the Clavinet as his main keyboard instrument on Van der Graaf Generator&#x27;s &quot;Godbluff&quot; (1975). Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Paul Jones played a Clavinet on &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;, as did Daryl Dragon on Captain &amp; Tennille&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; (both 1975). Late seventies hit singles to feature a Clavinet include Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot; and Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;.

Lachy Doley uses the Clavinet (with the Castle Bar modification, similar to a guitar&#x27;s whammy bar) as one of his main instruments. His YouTube videos showing him use the mod&#x27;s tremolo arm have gone viral. He bought his first Clavinet second-hand aged 17 for $150; the modification had already been made at the time he bought this. The signal from the Clavinet is fed into a Dunlop Cry Baby wah-wah pedal, then into a Fender Deville amplifier.

<text>&quot;Space Seed&quot; is the 22nd episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It was first broadcast by NBC on February 16, 1967. &quot;Space Seed&quot; was written by Gene L. Coon and Carey Wilber and directed by Marc Daniels.

In this episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew encounter a sleeper ship holding genetically engineered superpeople from Earth&#x27;s past. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbán), attempts to take control of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The episode also guest stars Madlyn Rhue as Lt. Marla McGivers, who becomes romantically involved with Khan.

The 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; serves as a sequel to this episode. Plot elements of the episode and &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; were also used in the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, and references to it appear in episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; finds the SS &quot;Botany Bay&quot; adrift in space. A landing party consisting of Captain Kirk, Doctor Leonard McCoy, Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, and historian Lieutenant Marla McGivers beams over to the derelict. The landing party finds a cargo of dozens of humans still alive in suspended animation after nearly 200 years. McGivers identifies the group&#x27;s leader, who begins to revive and is taken back to &quot;Enterprise&quot; for medical examination.

Kirk has &quot;Botany Bay&quot; taken in tow by a tractor beam, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; sets course for Starbase 12. In sickbay, the group&#x27;s leader awakens and introduces himself as &quot;Khan&quot;. McGivers marvels over Khan, a living relic from the 20th century, her field of interest. First Officer Spock discovers that their guest is actually Khan Noonien Singh, who, along with his people, are products of selective breeding designed to create perfect humans. The genetic superhumans instead became tyrants and conquered more than a third of the planet during the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s.

Khan is placed under guard in quarters. McGivers is sent to brief him on current events. Taking advantage of McGivers&#x27; attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help. Reluctantly, she agrees, and Khan revives the rest of his people and takes control of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression chamber, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s command crew agree to follow him. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his people. Khan escapes the gas and goes to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but Kirk confronts him and knocks Khan unconscious in the resulting fight.

Kirk holds a hearing to decide the fate of Khan and his people. Rather than sending them to a penal colony, Kirk offers Khan and his people exile to Ceti Alpha V, a harsh world that he believes would be a perfect place for Khan to &quot;tame&quot;. Khan accepts, citing Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; that it is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven. Kirk allows McGivers to go with Khan, rather than be court-martialed. Spock notes that it would be interesting to see what Khan makes of Ceti Alpha V in 100 years.

==Production==
===Writing===
Wilber conceived the general plot for a different series, &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;, which featured humans from Ancient Greece who were preserved in cryogenic suspension and revived. The script changed numerous times during preproduction as producer Bob Justman felt that it would be too expensive to film. Eventually Gene L. Coon and series creator Gene Roddenberry also made alterations. These revisions include the marooning of the criminals at the end of the episode and the change of the primary villain from a Nordic character to a Sikh. Roddenberry attempted to claim the primary writing credit for &quot;Space Seed&quot;, a request turned down by the Writers Guild of America.
Carey Wilber was hired to write a script for an episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. His idea was based on an episode he wrote for the television series &quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot; (1949–1955). His work on that show featured Ancient Greek-era humans transported in suspended animation through space, with the people of the future finding that they have mythological powers. For &quot;Space Seed&quot;, Wilber replaced these mythological powers with abilities that were enhanced due to genetic engineering. Wilber had briefly worked with Gene Roddenberry on the television series &quot;Harbormaster&quot;. His science fiction extended beyond &quot;Star Trek&quot;: he also wrote scripts for &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; around the same time.

In Wilber&#x27;s first proposal for the story that became &quot;Space Seed&quot;, dated August 29, 1966 (shortly before the first episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; aired) the villain was Harold Erickson, an ordinary criminal exiled into space. He sought to free his gang from &quot;Botany Bay&quot;, seize &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and become a pirate. Parts of the story were inspired by the use of penal colonies in the 18th century, and characterizations were based on descriptions from the series&#x27; writer&#x27;s bible. As a result, several elements of the draft differed from how the characters behaved in the series; for example, the draft includes a scene where Spock defeats Kirk at chess by cheating. Producer Gene L. Coon told Wilber that his work was the best outline he had seen during his time on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Fellow producer Bob Justman was less enthusiastic; he compared it negatively to &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, and felt the concept would be too expensive to film. There were also concerns that an unsolicited script submitted by science fiction author Philip José Farmer resembled the proposed plot which, as Roddenberry had corresponded with Farmer, might lead to litigation.

NBC executives reviewed the plot for &quot;Space Seed&quot; and approved it, but Justman reassessed the outline, saying that it needed to be heavily revised. In September, Wilber was given a list of suggested changes including asking him to remove any mention of the setting, as the producers did not want to say how far in the future &quot;Star Trek&quot; was set, and to remove the chess scene. Wilber submitted a second draft, but Roddenberry still had problems with basic elements of the script. He did not believe common criminals would be fired into space as a solution and strongly disliked the notion of space pirates. The second draft introduced the idea that Kirk marooned Erickson and his crew on a new planet; this remained in the final version. Wilber was not asked for a third draft; Coon was tasked with the re-write; he submitted it on December 7 and updated it twice over the following five days. Wilber accepted Coon&#x27;s re-writes, and left the staff after the submission of his second draft as his contractual obligations were complete.

Coon proposed that Erickson should be a rival to Kirk, a genetic superman who had once ruled part of Earth. Roddenberry and Justman were still unhappy with the script, and Roddenberry revised it once more a week before filming was due to begin, after Montalbán had been cast. In this draft the blond Nordic character of Erickson became closer to the version seen on screen. In Roddenberry and Coon&#x27;s script, the character was renamed Sibahl Khan Noonien. The name Govin Bahadur Singh was suggested by the DeForest Research company, who checked scripts for potential errors on behalf of the production company; the Singh name was suggested in part because it was closer to actual Sikh names. Coon and Roddenberry settled on Khan Noonien Singh; Roddenberry had an old Chinese friend named Noonien Wang that he had lost touch with, and hoped that Wang would see the episode and contact him. In the final draft, Roddenberry listed himself as the primary writer, Coon as co-writer and Wilber was absent, but the Writers Guild of America turned down Roddenberry&#x27;s request to be credited; Coon received the main credit; Wilber was given co-writer and &quot;story-by&quot; credits. Wilber did not often watch his own work, and nearly thirty years later had never seen &quot;Space Seed&quot;. Coon was later credited as Lee Cronin for his part in production of the script.

===Casting===

Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán was cast as the genetic superman Khan Noonian Singh, having been the first choice for the role. He had been suggested by casting director Joseph D&#x27;Agosta, who was not looking to cast an actor of a particular ethnic background due to Roddenberry&#x27;s vision for the series; Roddenberry wanted to show his perceived 23rd century values by not requiring any specific ethnicities when casting actors in guest roles. Montalbán had previously appeared in a television movie created by Roddenberry, &quot;The Secret Weapon of 117&quot; (also referred to as &quot;The Secret Defense of 117&quot;), which was the writer&#x27;s first attempt to create science fiction on television and aired more than ten years before &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Montalbán called his role as Khan &quot;wonderful&quot;, saying that &quot;it was well-written, it had an interesting concept and I was delighted it was offered to me&quot;. The main cast were enthusiastic about working with Montalbán; DeForest Kelley later said &quot;I enjoyed working with Ricardo the best. I was privileged. He is a marvelous actor.&quot;

Madlyn Rhue, who portrayed Lt. Marla McGivers, had previously worked with Montalbán in an episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; in 1960 as his on-screen wife; she later appeared with him in a 1982 episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. Montalbán and Rhue also appeared in separate episodes of Roddenberry&#x27;s previous NBC television series, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; (1963–1964). Main cast member George Takei did not appear in &quot;Space Seed&quot;; the character of Hikaru Sulu was replaced by Blaisdell Makee as Lt. Spinelli. It was the first of two appearances in &quot;Star Trek&quot; for Makee, who returned in the episode &quot;The Changeling&quot; as Lt. Singh. John Winston appeared for the second time as Lt. Kyle, and went on to make nine further episodic appearances in that role. Following positive feedback from the producers and the network regarding James Doohan, &quot;Space Seed&quot; was the first episode to feature a more prominent role for his character, Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott.

===Filming, costumes and post production===
Filming of &quot;Space Seed&quot; began December 15, 1966, and concluded on December 22 after six days of shooting. Roddenberry, Coon and Wilber&#x27;s rewrites resulted in a shooting script of nearly 60 pages and 120 scenes. Marc Daniels was hired to direct the episode; he had previously worked on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;. The first day&#x27;s filming coincided with the airing of the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, and Daniels allowed the cast and crew to go home early to watch it. The other five days ran to schedule, to the extent that there was an early finish on the final day of filming, allowing cast and crew time to return home to watch a repeat of the episode &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; which had replaced &quot;Arena&quot; on that evening&#x27;s schedule. A scene filmed but later cut from the episode depicted a discussion between McGivers and Angela Martine (Barbara Baldavin), intended to show that McGivers was looking for a forceful man. Further scenes were trimmed after filming following input from NBC. For example, scenes shot on the &quot;Botany Bay&quot; were cut as executives felt the costumes worn by the newly awakened crew were too revealing.

The character of Khan required five costumes, more than any other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalbán&#x27;s athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff thought there had been a mistake. Costume designer William Ware Theiss found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to fit his own preferences in design. Two of Khan&#x27;s outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalbán. The production built two new sets for the episode: the decompression chamber in sickbay, and the set on board &quot;Botany Bay&quot;. A doorframe from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy&#x27;s research lab, which appeared later in the series.

Post-production on &quot;Space Seed&quot; began on December 23, 1966, and ran through February 5 the following year. The Westheimer Company produced the majority of effects in the episode, but the scenes of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Botany Bay&quot; in space were produced by Film Effects of Hollywood who were not credited on screen for their work. &quot;Botany Bay&quot; utilized a design Matt Jefferies created prior to the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. It had been previously labeled &quot;antique space freighter&quot;, and was built by Film Effects of Hollywood. The creation of the ship miniature caused the episode to go over budget by more than $12,000; &quot;Space Seed&quot; actually cost a total of $197,262 against a budget of $180,000. By this point, the series was nearly $80,000 over budget in total. The &quot;Botany Bay&quot; model was later re-purposed as a freighter for the episode &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;.

The sound effects team borrowed effects and manipulated them in order to achieve the &quot;painted sound&quot; effect sought by Roddenberry. Although a number of sources were used, they attempted to avoid most science fiction television series as they wanted an authentic sound. The sound archive of the United States Air Force was used, although the photon torpedo sound was created from the 1953 film &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. &quot;Space Seed&quot; was awarded the Golden Reel for sound editing on television by the Motion Picture Sound Editors society.

==Reception==
===Broadcast===
&quot;Space Seed&quot; was first broadcast in the United States on February 16, 1967, on NBC. A 12-city overnight Trendex report compiled by Nielsen ratings showed that during the first half-hour, it held second place in the ratings behind &quot;Bewitched&quot; on ABC with 13.12 million viewers compared to &quot;Bewitched&quot;″s 14.44 million. The episode beat &quot;My Three Sons&quot; on CBS. During the second half-hour it was pushed into third place in the ratings by the start of the Thursday Night Movie on CBS, the Western film &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; starring Marlon Brando, which received 35.5 percent of the audience share compared to 28 percent for &quot;Space Seed&quot;.

A high-definition remastering of &quot;Space Seed&quot;, which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time on November 18, 2006, in broadcast syndication. It was the eleventh remastered episode to be shown. This meant that the episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and depending on the station it was broadcast either on November 18 or 19.

===Critical reception===

In 1967, &quot;The Indiana Gazette&quot; described &quot;Space Seed&quot; as &quot;a good piece of science fiction&quot;. The &quot;Kokomo Tribune&quot; called it &quot;imaginative&quot;, and also said that the episode was &quot;particularly interesting&quot; for &quot;its commentary on the scientific know-how of the late 1990s&quot;.

Later reviewers watched the episodes several decades after broadcast. Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an &#x27;A&#x27; rating, noting its strong characters and the interplay between Kirk and Spock that emphasizes their friendship. Michelle Erica Green called the episode &quot;legendary&quot; in her review for TrekNation. She thought that Khan made the &quot;perfect foil&quot; for the trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy and said that the episode was not dulled by later episodes and films based on &quot;Space Seed&quot;. In Mark Pickavance&#x27;s review at Den of Geek, he said that it remained an &quot;obvious choice of great source material&quot; to be followed up in a film.

The review by Eugene Myers and Torrie Atkinson on &quot;Tor.com&quot; criticized the attraction between McGivers and Khan, saying that it was &quot;really uncomfortable to watch her immediate attraction to him and her easy acceptance of his abusive and controlling behavior&quot;. Both praised the episode, Myers giving it a five out of six, and Atkinson a six out of six rating. &quot;Tor.com&quot; also placed &quot;Space Seed&quot; at number three of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s most underappreciated elements, saying that, &quot;As an introductory story to what old school &quot;Star Trek&quot; was all about, &#x27;Space Seed&#x27; is perfect. It presents an original science fiction concept, grapples with notions of human technology and ingenuity creating a monster, and features Captain Kirk beating the crap out of someone with a piece of Styrofoam. What more could you want?&quot;

The episode appears in numerous publications’ lists of top &quot;Original Series&quot; episodes, including &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Collider&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Vulture&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;; IGN ranked &quot;Space Seed&quot; as the fourth best, praising the fist fight between Kirk and Khan. It appeared in the top ten episodes listed by &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; and was also included in a list of ten &quot;must see&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes on &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;. Handlen said that it &quot;features a terrific performance from guest star Montalbán, gives the franchise one of its greatest villains, and sets the stage for one of the best science-fiction adventure movies ever made&quot;.

==Home media release and other adaptations==
The first adaptation of &quot;Space Seed&quot; was as a re-working into a short story by author James Blish as part of the novelization &quot;Star Trek 2&quot;. This book contained seven short stories, each based on an episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot; and was published in 1968. The adaptation of &quot;Space Seed&quot; appeared as the final story in the book.

&quot;Space Seed&quot; was the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode to go on public sale, sold as a single-episode VHS cassette in June 1982 by Paramount Home Video. It was one of the episodes of &quot;The Original Series&quot; published on Capacitance Electronic Disc, alongside &quot;The Changeling&quot;, released on November 1, 1982. A LaserDisc of the episode, alongside &quot;Return of the Archons&quot; was released in 1985. Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on VHS and Betamax. These releases reverted to a single episode tape as in the original 1982 version.

The episode was released on DVD paired with &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; as part of the general release of the series in 2000. There were no additional extras added to that entire series of releases, except the DVD containing &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot;. &quot;Space Seed&quot; was later released within a DVD box set of the first season in 2004; all three seasons of &quot;The Original Series&quot; were released as full-season box sets that year. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009. This release featured CGI remodels of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and other space scenes, including the &quot;Botany Bay&quot;. The most recent release is as part of the &quot;Star Trek: Origins&quot; collection on Blu-ray, which was released in 2013.

==Legacy==
===Khan===

The events of &quot;Space Seed&quot; are followed up in the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Harve Bennett was hired to produce a sequel to &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; having never seen the television series; he watched every episode in preparation and latched onto Khan from &quot;Space Seed&quot; as the compelling villain he considered to be lacking from the first film.

In reprising the role of Khan, Montalbán worried that fans would see him only as Mr. Roarke from &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; but felt that he managed to recapture the character after re-watching &quot;Space Seed&quot;. The film set a record for the opening weekend gross of $14.3 million, and went on to take $78.9 million domestically within the United States, making it the sixth best-selling film of the year.

Khan recognizes Pavel Chekov&quot; with Chekov has an earlier Stardate than &quot;Space Seed&quot;, confirming that he joined &quot;Enterprise&quot; before Khan&#x27;s arrival.

Events of both &quot;Space Seed&quot; and &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; were also directly referenced in 2013&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, in which Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed Khan. The film took $70.1 million on the opening weekend, and $467.3 million internationally throughout the cinematic release.

The television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; makes several further references to the events first described in &quot;Space Seed&quot;. In &quot;Twilight&quot;, the survivors of the Xindi attack on Earth eventually resettle on Ceti Alpha V. The development of Khan and his followers were said to have been through selective breeding in &quot;Space Seed&quot;. American sociologist William Sims Bainbridge said that this method would have been unable to create genetic supermen in such a short space of time and that today the less implausible method of genetic engineering (directly changing the DNA code) would be used. In fact, subsequent references to the creation of Khan and the other supermen, such as in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Doctor Bashir, I Presume&quot;, substituted genetic engineering.

A non-canonical novelization by Greg Cox was later released in 2005 to fill in the timeframe between &quot;Space Seed&quot; and the film, titled &quot;To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh&quot;. This book expanded on Khan&#x27;s romance with McGivers, and the author wanted to &quot;give her a spine&quot; as he felt that she was not &quot;the pride of Starfleet, and even less of a feminist role-model&quot; in her appearance in &quot;Space Seed&quot;.

As part of their line of licensed &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic books, IDW Publishing launched a non-canonical five-part mini-series titled &quot;Star Trek: Khan&quot; which described the early part of Khan&#x27;s life and how the events in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; diverged from those seen in &quot;Space Seed&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s writers, Roberto Orci, was the story consultant on the comic series. This series also explained how Khan changed physically in order to be represented by Cumberbatch in the film. A retro-style film poster for &quot;Space Seed&quot; was created by Juan Ortiz in 2013, released around the same as &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;.

===Eugenics Wars===
The Eugenics Wars, first mentioned in &quot;Space Seed&quot;, are stated in the &quot;Star Trek Chronology&quot; by Michael and Denise Okuda as taking place between 1992 and 1996. They considered it fortunate that these events did not come to pass in the real world, and noted that the development of the &quot;Botany Bay&quot; in 1996 as an instance of where &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; technological predictions have missed by a significant margin&quot;. The war itself has been referenced elsewhere in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The first mention of the wars following &quot;Space Seed&quot; was in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot;, in which a cloned version of Dr. Stavos Keniclius, a scientist from that era, clones Spock. Later, during the production of &quot;Doctor Bashir, I Presume?&quot;, writer René Echevarria, seeking a secret past for Doctor Julian Bashir, noted that coverage of the issue of eugenics in &quot;Star Trek&quot; had been limited to Khan and his followers. Fellow writer Ronald D. Moore decided to link the background of Bashir to genetic engineering. &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; and &quot;Star Trek First Contact&quot; confused matters by saying World War III (otherwise known as The Eugenics Wars) had occurred in the 2050s. When Echevarria wrote that the Eugenics Wars took place 200 years before the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Doctor Bashir, I Presume?&quot;, he took the time interval directly from &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, failing to factor in the additional century between the events of the original series (and its associated films).

Novelist Gary Cox first mentioned the events of the Eugenics Wars in his non-canonical novel &quot;Assignment: Eternity&quot;, which followed up on the events of the episode &quot;&quot; and included the characters of Gary Seven and Roberta Lincoln. In it, he mentioned that Seven and Lincoln were involved in overthrowing Khan during the Eugenics Wars. He had not intended to explore this any further, but he was prompted to do so by his editor at Pocket Books. He wrote a story, split into two books, about the specific events of the Eugenics Wars, entitled &quot;Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh&quot;. As the Eugenics Wars were already meant to have taken place, he described them as a secret history that was not discovered until generations had passed. He also felt that this approach would make the books consistent with the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Future&#x27;s End&quot; in which the crewmembers travel in time to the same period of Earth&#x27;s history as the Eugenics Wars, but find no such wars taking place. A further version of the Eugenics Wars was presented in the &quot;Star Trek: Khan&quot; comic book mini-series.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; season four episodes &quot;Borderland&quot;, &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; and &quot;The Augments&quot; showed a further group of genetic superpeople produced from embryos produced in the same era as Khan and his crew. This was a deliberate link by the producers of &quot;Enterprise&quot; to both &quot;Space Seed&quot; and &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, and was one of several plots during the fourth season of the show to include elements of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; in the hope that this would boost ratings.

<text>Yona Yahav (; born 19 June 1944) is an Israeli lawyer and politician currently serving as the mayor of Haifa since 2024. Yahav previously served as Mayor from 2003 and, 2018, when he lost re-election Einat Kalisch-Rotem. In 2024, Yahav was re-elected as Mayor, defeating David Etzioni. Yahav also served as a member of the Knesset for Labor from 1996 to 1999

==Biography==
Yahav was born in Haifa during the period of the Mandate era. During his national service he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Military Police Corps of the IDF. He studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, gaining a LL.B, before continuing his legal studies at the University of London, where he served as secretary-general of the World Union of Jewish Students.

When he returned to Israel, Yahav became active in politics. He was an advisor to Minister of Transport Gad Yaacobi and the spokesman of Teddy Kollek, mayor of Jerusalem. In 1996 he was elected to the Knesset on the Labor Party list, and served as the chairman of the subcommittee for banking. However, he lost his seat in the 1999 elections.

Yahav later left Labour and joined Shinui. In 2003, he was elected mayor of Haifa on a joint Shinui-Greens ticket, having already served as deputy mayor. On 29 June 2006 he defected to Kadima, but remained mayor of the city. He is also chairman of the Haifa Economic Corporation and previously chaired the Haifa International Film Festival organisation and the city&#x27;s theatre executive. In the 2018 Haifa mayoral election, he lost to Einat Kalisch-Rotem, who garnered 56% of the votes. However, in the following elections, in 2024, he ran again and defeated David Etzioni by winning 62% of the votes.

<text>A taxicab stand (also called taxi rank, cab stand, taxi stand, cab rank, or hack stand) is a queue area on a street or on private property where taxicabs line up to wait for passengers.

==Operation==

Stands are normally located at high-traffic locations such as airports, hotel driveways, railway stations, subway stations, bus depots, ferry terminals, shopping centres, and major street intersections. Usually stands are marked by simple painted signs. 

Stands generally work as a first-come, first-served queue, so that the first taxicab to arrive on the stand (the one at the front of the line) serves the first passenger to arrive, and as the first taxicab leaves, each taxicab behind it moves ahead one spot, with the last taxicab to arrive taking the last spot.

In the Republic of Ireland an intending passenger is entitled to choose any taxicab that is available for hire at an appointed taxi stand. The Commission for Taxi Regulation has deemed that the customer has the right to choose and that the principle of first come, first served is dismissed.

==Around the world==
In some cities, such as London and New York, some older taxi stands are marked by special lamps with &quot;TAXI&quot; painted on the sides of them.

Some major stands are divided into separate queues. For example, at the Nagoya railway station in Japan, small- and large-capacity taxis line up separately; while at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport in Shanghai, short- and long-distance taxis use separate queues. In Hong Kong, different kinds of taxis line up separately, as some of their service areas overlap.

==Recharging==
Taxicab stands can be used to recharge batteries of electric taxis.

<doc id="413165" wikidata="Q3488859" url="?curid=413165" title="Errand of Mercy">
<text>&quot;Errand of Mercy&quot; is the twenty-sixth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Gene L. Coon and directed by John Newland, it was first broadcast on March 23, 1967. It was the first episode in which the Klingons appeared.

In the episode, with a war with the Klingons declared, Captain Kirk and his First Officer, Mr. Spock, attempt to sway the incomprehensibly placid population of a planet near the Klingon border to resist an invading military occupation.

The Klingon governor, Kor (played by John Colicos), would return in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Time Trap&quot; voiced by James Doohan. He would return again decades later in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episodes &quot;Blood Oath&quot;, &quot;The Sword of Kahless&quot; and &quot;Once More Unto the Breach&quot;. In &quot;The Sword of Kahless&quot;, Worf mentions Kor&#x27;s encounter with Kirk.

==Plot==
Negotiations between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire have collapsed, and the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; is sent to the world of Organia, a non-aligned planet near the Klingon border, to prevent the Klingons from taking advantage of its strategic location. As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; approaches Organia, the ship is attacked and destroys a Klingon vessel.

Upon arriving on the planet&#x27;s surface, Kirk and Spock find a peaceful but technologically primitive town. Kirk appeals to Ayelborne, the head of the local council to allow the Federation to help them resist Klingon occupation, but the Organians adamantly oppose any use of violence. When a Klingon fleet appears in orbit, Kirk orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to withdraw, which strands himself and Spock on the planet.

Ayelborne disguises Kirk and Spock to avoid suspicion and the Klingons seize control of the planet without resistance, installing the ranking Klingon officer, Kor, as the military governor. Kor has Spock questioned with a &quot;mind sifter&quot; device to confirm he is not a spy and designates Kirk as the Organian civilian liaison with the occupation force. Spock uses his mental discipline to withstand the scrutiny of the device.

That evening, in an attempt to inspire the Organians, Spock and Kirk sabotage a munitions dump outside the town. Ayelborne reveals the true identities of the Federation officers to Kor. He and the council then mysteriously free the two before the Klingons can torture information out of them. While Kirk and Spock try to comprehend the council&#x27;s contradictory actions, Kor orders the execution of two hundred Organians, yet the council seems unmoved.

As the Federation and Klingon fleets ready themselves for a confrontation in the system, Kirk and Spock raid the Klingon headquarters in hopes of rousing the population into resistance. They capture Kor and prepare to make a last stand. The Organians then reveal their true nature: they are highly advanced incorporeal beings. They instantly incapacitate both sides, forcing them to agree to a cessation of hostilities. The Organians predict that the two sides will work together in the future.

==Production==
Story editor D.C. Fontana said she thought the Romulans were much more interesting than the Klingons, but the Klingons were chosen as the regular adversaries of the series because they did not need any special make-up like the pointed ears for the Romulans.

The Klingons&#x27; dark-skinned, mustachioed look was the idea of John Colicos who played Kor. Make-up artist Fred Phillips agreed that they should have a &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; look. In Gene L. Coon&#x27;s script, the Klingons were described as simply, &quot;Oriental. Hard-faced.&quot;

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B+&#x27; rating, describing it as &quot;fun&quot; but noting &quot;logical holes throughout&quot;.

Hollywood.com said &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot; was among the best of &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes about the Klingons, noting in this episode the war-craving Klingons thought the Organians were peasants. A ranking of every episode of the original series by &quot;Hollywood&quot;, placed this episode 25th out of 79 episodes.

In a review of fictional Star Trek aliens in 2018 by &quot;CBR&quot;, the Organians were noted as a powerful species. They were particularly impressed with the Organian character Trefayne, who was one of the Organian council members that talks to Kirk.

In 2016, SyFy ranked guest star John Colicos&#x27;s performance as Kor (the Klingon leader), as the 13th best guest star on the original series. Colicos went on to reprise his role as Kor decades later on the Star Trek spin-off &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The franchise was trying to do numerous cross-overs whenever possible to enhance continuity. Directors were happy with enhancements to continuity, such as actors reprising their roles as characters the audience was already familiar with. Being consistent with continuity and bringing back old characters meant the audience would feel familiar with what was being presented.

A 2018 &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, recommended this episode as part of the &quot;foundations of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;.

==In Popular Culture==

The 1988 song &quot;What&#x27;s on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot; by American synth-pop band Information Society uses a sample of Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s voice from this episode. Nimoy&#x27;s son Adam facilitated this. The same sample was used in the 2018 song &quot;Dame Tu Cosita&quot; by El Chombo and Cutty Ranks.

<doc id="413169" wikidata="Q333410" url="?curid=413169" title="Brian Mawhinney">
<text>Brian Stanley Mawhinney, Baron Mawhinney, (26 July 1940 – 9 November 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was a member of the Cabinet from 1994 to 1997 and a member of Parliament (MP) from 1979 to 2005.

==Early life==
Mawhinney was born on 26 July 1940 in Belfast, son of Frederick Stanley Arnot Mawhinney and Coralie Anita Jean (née Wilkinson). His family was heavily involved with an Open Brethren church. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, and studied physics at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, gaining an upper second class degree in 1963.

He then began studying for a doctorate from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London. In 1963, he briefly moved to the United States for his education, settling in Ann Arbor, Michigan but travelling throughout the country, engaging with politics and becoming more involved with Christian evangelism, participating in missions led by Billy Graham. It was also during this time that he met his wife, Betty Oja, whom he married in 1964. He obtained his PhD in 1969, with thesis title &quot;Studies on the effects of radiation on mammalian bone grown in vitro&quot;. He worked as assistant professor of radiation research at the University of Iowa from 1968 to 1970 and then returned to the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine as a lecturer from 1970 to 1984. 

==Political career==
Mawhinney joined the Conservative Party shortly after his return to England. He contested Stockton-on-Tees in October 1974 but lost to Labour incumbent, Bill Rodgers. He was elected Member of Parliament for Peterborough in the 1979 election, serving until 1997. He was then MP for North West Cambridgeshire from 1997 to 2005. 

Mawhinney was a social conservative who opposed abortion and Sunday trading. He also campaigned prolifically against pornography: he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill in 1979 to ban indecent images and posters outside cinemas, sex shops and strip clubs, and in early 1980, he called for Keith Joseph to launch an inquiry into a page on the Post Office&#x27;s Prestel viewdata service, called &quot;A Buyer&#x27;s Guide to Dirty Books&quot;.

===In Government===
He was PPS to John Wakeham from 1982 to 1983, and PPS to Tom King from 1984 to 1986. He became a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office in 1986, and then became Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office in 1990. In 1992, he became Minister of State at the Department of Health until 1994.

===Cabinet===
Having been sworn of the Privy Council in the 1994 New Year Honours, he entered the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Transport that year. He served as Chairman of the Conservative Party and Minister without Portfolio for two years from 1995 until the 1997 election. He was knighted in the 1997 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours.

===In Opposition===
He served as Shadow Home Secretary and spokesman for home, constitutional and legal affairs for a year under William Hague before returning to the back benches in June 1998. He stepped down from the House of Commons in April 2005.

===House of Lords===
On 13 May 2005 it was announced that he would be created a life peer in the 2005 Dissolution Honours, and on 24 June he was created Baron Mawhinney, of Peterborough, in the County of Cambridgeshire. 

Lord Mawhinney questioned the priority David Cameron had given to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, stating that it was a distraction.

He took leave of absence from the House of Lords in October 2017 for health reasons.

==Outside politics==
In 2003, he was appointed chairman of The Football League, and in 2004 oversaw a re-organisation of the league structure, renaming the former Division One as the Football League Championship. Deeply religious, Mawhinney was a leading member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship as well as a member of the Church of England General Synod for five years. He was also president of &quot;Christians in Sport&quot;. Mawhinney was also a patron of Peterborough United until his death in November 2019.

==Personal life and death==
In 1964, Mawhinney married Betty Oja, an American citizen whom he met during his time in Michigan; the couple had three children. He listed Anglo-American relations among his interests. He wrote two autobiographies: &quot;In the Firing Line&quot; (1999) and &quot;Just a Simple Belfast Boy&quot; (2013).

Mawhinney lived in Chipping Barnet, and then Keyston, Cambridgeshire in his later years. He died at a nursing home in nearby Polebrook, Northamptonshire, on 9 November 2019, aged 79.

<text>San Luis Potosí, officially the Free and Sovereign State of San Luis Potosí, is one of the 32 states which compose the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided in 59 municipalities and is named after its capital city, San Luis Potosí.

It is located in eastern and central Mexico and is bordered by seven other Mexican states: Nuevo León to the north; Tamaulipas to the north-east; Veracruz to the east; Hidalgo, Querétaro and Guanajuato to the south; and Zacatecas to the north-west. In addition to the capital city, other major cities in the state include Ciudad Valles, Matehuala, Rioverde, and Tamazunchale.

==History==
In pre-Columbian times, the territory now occupied by the state of San Luis Potosí contained parts of the cultural areas of Mesoamerica and Aridoamerica. Its northern and western-central areas were inhabited by the Otomi and Chichimeca tribes. These indigenous groups were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Although many indigenous people died during Spanish colonization, Huasteco groups still live, along with Pame and Náhua peoples.

In 1592, gold and silver deposits were discovered, which triggered the establishment of the state. Spanish miners established the first town known as “San Luis de Mezquitique”, modern location of the capital San Luis Potosí. This led to Juan de Oñate being appointed as the first mayor.

The State was given the name &quot;San Luis Rey&quot;, &quot;King Saint Louis&quot;, in honor of Louis IX of France, and &quot;Potosí&quot; because the wealth of the state compared to the rich silver mines in Potosí, Bolivia. Settlers had hopes of rivaling the wealth of the Bolivian mine, but this was never truly accomplished. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Franciscans, Augustinians, and Jesuits arrived in the area and settled, then began to build churches and other buildings, many of which are still standing and have been turned into museums and universities.

In mid-1821, after the Independence of Mexico, General Jose Antonio Echavarri intimidated and threatened the Mayor and the City Council to surrender the city of San Luis to the Army of the Three Guarantees of Agustín de Iturbide (Ejercito de las Tres Garantias de Iturbide), who at the time was emperor of Mexico. They submitted to his demand, as there was no way to resist, and thus proclamation of Independence of San Luis Potosí was declared. The first Constitution of San Luis Potosí was then written on October 16, 1826, and was in effect until 1835 when Congress proclaimed it centralist. At this point, local legislatures disappeared and state governors were appointed by the central government. This situation lasted until the promulgation of the 1857 Constitution.

The state&#x27;s participation in the Mexican–American War in 1846–1847 gave it the name &quot;San Luis de la Patria&quot;, which translates into English, &quot;Saint Louis of the Homeland&quot;, for having contributed important leaders and ideas during the struggle with the United States. During the Reform War, state involvement was very prominent, and during the French Intervention in 1863, the city of San Luis Potosí became the capital of the country under the order of President Benito Juárez.

During the regime of Maximilian, San Luis became an important location. The city was held by the Imperialists until late 1866. In that year, the telegraph line was opened between San Luis Potosí and Mexico City, which opened up communication lines and helped begin the industrialization of the state.

==Geography==
The state lies mostly on the Mexican Plateau, with the exception of the eastern part of the state, where the tableland breaks down into the tropical valley of the Tampaon River (which continues flowing northwestward until it becomes the Pánuco River, which divides San Luis Potosí from the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas). The surface of the plateau is comparatively level, with some low mountainous wooded ridges. The Sierra Madre Oriental runs north and south through the state, and separates the Mexican Plateau from the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. The Sierra Madre Oriental is home to the Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests. The easternmost portion of the state lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain, and covered by the Veracruz moist forests. The eastern part is included in the region commonly referred to as &quot;La Huasteca&quot;.

The Tampaón river and its tributaries drain the southern and southeastern portion of the state. The northern and central portion of the state, including the capital, lie on an interior drainage basin which does not drain to the sea.

The mean elevation is about , ensuring a mostly temperate climate. The state lies partly within the arid zone of the north, while the southern half receiving more rainfall through the influence of the Nortes, which deliver significant amounts of rain. The rainfall, however, is uncertain at the western and northern regions, and much of the state does not have major rivers. The soil is fertile and in favorable seasons large crops of wheat, maize, beans and cotton are grown on the uplands. In the low tropical valleys, sugar, coffee, tobacco, peppers and fruit are staple products. Livestock is an important industry and hides, tallow and wool are exported. Fine cabinet and construction woods are also made and exported to a limited extent.

Potosí (in Bolivia) was believed to have enough gold to build a bridge between Potosí and Spain. San Luis Potosí was compared to it upon the discovery of the mines and therefore named after it.

At one time San Luis Potosí ranked among the leading mining provinces of Mexico, but the revolts following independence resulted in a great decline in that industry. The area around Real de Catorce has some of the richest silver mines in the country. Other well-known silver mining districts are Peñón Blanco, Ramos and Guadalcázar. The development of Guadalcazar dates from 1620 and its ores yield gold, copper, zinc and bismuth, as well as silver. In the Ramos district, the Cocinera lode was said to have had a total yield of over $60,000,000 in the first decade of the 20th century.

===Municipalities===

As of 2024, the state of San Luis Potosí is divided into 59 municipalities (), each headed by a municipal president (mayor). These are similar in function to counties. As of the 2020 Mexican census, the largest municipalities by population are:
* San Luis Potosí (the state capital)
* Soledad de Graciano Sánchez
* Ciudad Valles
* Villa de Pozos
* Matehuala
* Rioverde
* Tamazunchale

===Environmental issues===
====Mining====
In 1996, Minera San Xavier (MSX), a subsidiary of Canadian company New Gold, announced plans to start open pit mining at Cerro San Pedro. There was major opposition to the project, but in 2007, the mine started operating, and was still both active and disputed as of 2016.

One of the mountains within the state&#x27;s declared National Sacred Site, Wirikuta, is being purchased for silver mining by a Canadian company, First Majestic Silver. The mountain is an important site for the Huichol ceremonial migration, Peyote hunt, and deer dance. On October 27, 2000, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) claimed this site as a protected area for its importance as a cultural route and endemic flora and fauna species. Later on June 9, 2001, it was declared as a National Sacred Site under the State of San Luis Potosí&#x27;s Natural Protection Act. First Majestic Silver Corp. still decided to purchase mineral rights on November 13, 2009, with 80% of their interest within the protected land. The company&#x27;s current methods includes open pit mining and leaching through cyanide, using two kilograms of NaCN per tonne of ore. While open pit mining itself removes entire habitats and landscapes, the addition of sodium cyanide (with a mean lethal dose of only 0.2 grams) is potentially lethal. In April 2010 the company also opened a new cyanidation plant in Coahuila, Mexico, where it has started producing 3,500 tons of cyanide a day to help them expand their mining efforts. Currently the Huichol people are trying to find outside groups to help them in the conservation of their land and culture by protecting this mountain.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the state shows Louis IX of France, after whom the state was named, standing on a hill in the town of Cerro de San Pedro, where gold and silver were discovered. The state was well known for its gold and silver mines, so there are two gold bars on the left and two silver bars on the right. The blue and yellow backgrounds represent night and day, respectively.

==Governors==

The current governor, is Ricardo Gallardo Cardona of the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico.

==Economy==
The State has a unique position within the country, since it is located in between three major cities; Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, and near four major ports; Tampico, Altamira, Manzanillo, and Mazatlán. Its varied climate patterns and territory along with extensive communications networks enabled it to maintain attractive business environments.

Traditionally, the Real de Minas potosino has driven the industrial engines in the state of San Luis Potosí, and as such, nowadays basic metallurgy still has the largest contribution within the gross domestic product of the entity. The main metals and products extracted across mines are zinc, copper, lead, gold, silver, mercury, manganese, and arsenic. Other major industries following the mining lead are in the sectors of chemicals, foods, beverages, tobacco, and textiles.

The services sector, also known as tertiary, is second regarding contribution to the state&#x27;s income with a 21%, followed by commerce, hotels and restaurants with 18%.
These combined activities employ 51% of the economically active population or EAP.

Agriculture has been a traditional activity, sometimes still practiced in the Huasteca region. Currently, even if it contributes very little to the state GDP, it nevertheless employs as much as 20% of the EAP of the entity. The main agricultural products grown on Potosí soil are maize, beans, barley, sugar cane, oranges, coffee, sour lemon, prickly pear, and mango. Livestock activities are focused on raising sheep, cattle, and pigs.

The state is also a contributor to the large automotive industry of Mexico. General Motors now has a plant under construction, San Luis Potosí Assembly, to employ up to 1,800 people which will have the capacity to produce up to 160,000 vehicles per year, or about 440 cars per day.

 The new plant in San Luis Potosí is an important pillar of the BMW Group&#x27;s global production strategy who aim to achieve a balance in our production and sales in the different world regions. Its grand opening on June 7, 2019, created 1,500 jobs, eco friendly by being supplied with 100% of CO2 free electricity, and produce 150,000 (3 series model only) vehicles annually.
Cummins has also had a manufacturing presence in San Luis Potosí since 1980 and employs nearly 2,000 people there.

ABB Group multinational in Mexico moved its headquarters from Mexico City to San Luis Potosí in 2007.

Throughout the state, major industrial parks can be seen, especially in highly urbanized areas such as the capital, San Luis Potosí, and other major cities.

The minimum wage in the state is 66.45 pesos per day as of 2015.

== Demographics ==

The state of San Luis Potosí reports a population of 2,822,255 people. The population growth rate from 2010 to 2013 was about 3.6%.

The state&#x27;s population is relatively young, 60% of its residents being under 30 years of age. The state reports a life expectancy rate similar to the national average, that is, 72 years for men, and 77 years of age for women.

Regarding cultural and ethnic diversity, 15% of the state population is indigenous, and the most representative language is Nahuatl, followed by Huasteco. The native people of the state include the Huastec and Pame peoples. 

According to the 2020 Census, 44.8% of San Luis Potosí&#x27;s population identified as Indigenous, 8.2% Afro-Mexican, and 39.1% Spanish descent and 7.9% mix/other.

Concerning immigrants and people of European ancestry, 63% of the population has some form of European roots, mostly from Spain. During the colonization and establishment of Mexico, there was a constant flow of Spanish immigrants. There have also been large influxes during instabilities in Spain, such as during the Spanish Civil War. Besides Spanish people, there is also a significant population of descendants of Italian immigrants, especially in cities such as Rio Verde and Cerritos. Most of the European peoples have arrived through the state of Veracruz to the East.

Nonetheless, due to its relative isolation, the state is one of the nine states in Mexico which report high rates of migration into the United States between the years of 2000 to 2008.

==Education==
The average schooling rate for those over 15 years of age lies at 7.7 years of education, considerably lower than the 8.1 found nationally. The same portion of those older than the age of 15 yield a 28% dropout rate of primary school. Children under the age of 14 years have a 4% school dropout rate. The literacy rate is about 90.8%, most of the illiterate being the older generation. There is only one major university in the state, Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí (UASLP).

*Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus San Luis Potosí (ITESM).
*Universidad del Valle de México, Campus San Luis Potosí (UVM).
*Universidad Cuauhtémoc, Campus San Luis Potosí (UCSLP).
*Universidad Tecnológica de San Luis Potosí (UTSLP).
*Universidad Politécnica de San Luis Potosí (UPSLP).

<text>The Societas Rosicruciana (or Rosicrucian Society) is a Rosicrucian order which limits its membership to Christian Master Masons. The order was founded in Scotland, but now exists in Scotland, England, Canada, Portugal, and the United States. While a prospective member must be a Trinitarian Christian Master Mason in good standing with a Grand Lodge that is recognized by the Grand Lodge of the jurisdiction in which the Society meets, the various Societies have no other Masonic links, ties, or official recognition. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, membership is by invitation only. As the Society offers assistance to all its members in working out the great problems of nature and science, it functions in some respects as a research society.


==History==
The Societas Rosicruciana claims a link to the original Rosicrucian Brotherhood. It bases its teachings on those found in the &quot;Fama&quot; and &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot;, texts published in Germany in the early 17th century, along with other similar publications from the same time.

There are a number of Societas Rosicrucianas throughout the world:
*Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia (SRIS; Scotland)
*Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA; England)
*Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis (SRICF; United States)
*Societas Rosicruciana in Canada (SRIC; Canada)
*Societas Rosicruciana in Lusitania (SRIL; Portugal)

===Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia (SRIS)===

The first Societas Rosicruciana was that of Scotland, known as the &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia&quot; (SRIS).

As at January 2014 there are seven Colleges in Scotland, three in Australia, one in Hong Kong, and one in Finland.

The Colleges in Scotland are the Metropolitan College (Edinburgh), the East of Scotland College (Dundee), Abraxas College (Falkirk), the West of Scotland College (Glasgow), the Muse Coila College (Stewarton, Ayrshire), the Inverness College (Inverness), and the Semper Discens College (Aberdeen).

The Colleges in Australia are the Aurora Australis College (Petersham, NSW), the Hunter Valley College (New Lambton, NSW), and the Huon Pine College (Launceston, Tasmania). 

The Hong Kong College is in Hong Kong. The Aurora Borealis College is in Seinäjoki, Finland.

===Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA)===

The &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia&quot; was founded in 1867 and derived from the SRIS following the admission of William James Hughan and Robert Wentworth Little into that order. The two of them were advanced quickly in Scotland and granted a warrant to form a Society in England. The formation meeting took place on June 1, 1867 in Aldermanbury, London, with Robert Wentworth Little elected Supreme Magus.

Most Colleges in Australia belong to provinces within the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA).

===Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis (SRICF)===

The &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis&quot; is a Rosicrucian Society based in the United States. Its history begins with the formation of a Grand High Council on April 21, 1880. Its official consecration occurred on September 21, 1880, by three Colleges chartered by the Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia. High Grade senior Christian Freemasons in the United States in search of the Classical Rosicrucian Society for Masons in the United Kingdom became interested in organizing a similar body in the United States. They did so under Scotland&#x27;s authority (Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia) with the help of Most Worthy Charles Matier of the SRIS, as early as 1873. This effort died out two years later under the care of R.W. Frater George S. Blackie VIII and was then re-chartered by the SRIS in 1878. Dr. Jonathon J. French was a IX grade head of the Rosicrucian Society of the United States, and opened the Matier Royal Provincial College with a charter from Lord Inverurie, Earl of Kintore and Supreme Magus of the SRIS. The college was named after Charles Fitzgerald Matier, the first Supreme Magus of SRIS, who served in 1876. Harold Van Buren Voorhis insists that the Illinois College under Dr. French was never truly active, and it certainly was short-lived as Dr. French died an untimely death in 1879. Harold Voorhis also insisted that Frater Stodart Blackie&#x27;s early charter in New York had been nothing more than an unsubstantiated rumor. It has since been established as historical fact.

In 1878, a group of senior U.S. Masons (Daniel Sutter and Charles W. Parker) led by Charles E. Meyer (1839–1908) of Pennsylvania traveled to England and on July 25, 1878 were initiated into the grade of Zelator at Yorkshire College at Sheffield. They applied for a charter, but getting no response, turned to Scotland and received a charter from the college in Edinburgh in 1879. Scotland&#x27;s Society is actually the oldest, as Walter Spencer is recorded as having been initiated into the SRIS by Anthony O’Neal Haye in 1857, and there are documents in the SRIA archives that show that both Robert Wentworth Little and William J. Hughan were initiated in 1866 and 1867 by Anthony O’Neal Haye, Magus Max, Ros. Soc. Scot., with H.H.M. Bairnfathur signing as Secretary. The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia was formed in England in 1866 by Robert Wentworth Little. The SRIA later felt the need to charter the current SRIS on October 24, 1873.

A second charter was granted by the SRIS for a college in New York, and Fratres from Philadelphia and New York met in Philadelphia on April 21, 1880 and formed a High Council, then known as the SRRCA or the &quot;Societas Rosicrucianae Reipublica Confoedera America&quot;, later changed to the Society of Rosicrucians in the USA by Most Worthy Frater Shryock in his capacity as Supreme Magus, and then properly Latinized in 1934 by and at the suggestion of Dr. William Moseley Brown under the regime of Most Worthy Frater Hamilton. Brown composed the name (Societas Rosicruciana In Civitatibus Foederatis) himself and submitted it on January 17, 1934. The SRICF has operated continuously since its formation in the 19th Century, and is thriving today with an upsurge of young Masons being invited into its ranks with great enthusiasm and demonstrated scholarship.

Membership is by invitation only and predicated on regular mainstream Masonic affiliation as well as a profession of Christian faith. Membership was initially restricted to 36 members per College, but this was changed in 1908 by MW Thomas Shryock to 72 members per college. The See of the High Council is in Washington, D.C. The SRICF is in amity with the SRIS (Scotia) and the SRIA (Anglia) as well as the SRIC (Canada) and has helped the cause of Rosicruciana by empowering High Councils in their own sovereignty around the World. They are the SRIL in Lusitania (Portugal), SRIG in Gallia (France) and the SRIR (Romania).

The society issues an annual journal known as &quot;Ad Lucem&quot; composed of academic articles on things related to Rosicrucianism and esoteric streams of Christian Mysteries. There is also an annual report, &quot;The Rosicrucian Fama&quot;. Many of the Colleges have their own individual organs which are produced quarterly as well as annually. The governing body of the Society is known since 1911 (having dropped ‘Grand’ from its title) as the High Council, which is composed of Fratres of the Third Order (IX and VIII), plus any College Celebrant not a member of the Third Order. The head of the Society is the Supreme Magus, who was elected &quot;ad vitam&quot; up until circa 1991, when the constitution of the Society was changed to provide that the Supreme Magus is elected each triennium. Unlike the SRIA in England, a Chief Adept in the SRICF does not have regional powers, but rather is in charge of an individual College. Typically there is but one College per state, exceptions having been made for both New York and California due to their size and population.

The &quot;Societas Rosicruciana in Canadiensis&quot; was first mentioned in a declaration dated May 31, 1876, but it was not formally constituted (by a Col. McLeod Moore, through his acquaintance with John Yarker) until September 19 of that year. Most of the membership came from the town of Maitland, Ontario. The society constituted a High Council exactly one year later, but the Society went into abeyance at some point after 1889.

In 1936, Ontario College was created via a charter from SRICF. Manly Palmer Hall&#x27;s father, E.H.D. Hall, a member of Canada&#x27;s first Rosicrucian Society, was voted a charter member of the Ontario College. Due to possible jurisdictional issues, rather than procure a charter from SRIA or SRIS, a Canadian High Council was formed on June 29, 1997, and the SRIC is now an independent body.

===Societas Rosicruciana in Lusitania (S.R.I.L.)===

The Societas Rosicruciana in Lusitania (SRIL) was constituted on October 5, 2002 in Portugal. Its High Council was empowered by the Societas Rosicruciana in Civitabus Foederatis (USA) and the first Supreme Magus, Pinto Coelho, was consecrated by the M.W. Supreme Magus Thurman Pace Jr (SRICF).
Membership is by invitation only, and predicated on regular mainstream Masonic affiliation as well as a profession of Trinitarian Christian faith. Membership is restricted to 72 members per College, and they are called Fraters. The SRIL is in amity with all regular Rosicrucian Societas: Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia (SRIS), Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA) and, Societas Rosicruciana in Civitas Foederatis ,(SRICF). The various Societies have no other Masonic links, ties, or official recognition.
The Societas Rosicruciana in Lusitania has, through mutual help and fraternal encouragement, help to unravel the great problems of Life, to discover the Secrets of Nature, to study the system of Philosophy taught by the Fratres of the Rose-Cross since the year 1440, and to seek the meaning and symbolism of all the heritage of Wisdom, Arts and Literature of the ancient world.
The governing body of the Society is the High Council which is composed of Fratres of the Third Order (IX and VIII) plus any College Celebrant not a member of the Third Order. The head of the Society is titled the Supreme Magus, and was elected &quot;ad vitam&quot;, but according to the revised constitution of 2019 the SRIL Supreme Magus is now elected for 3 years, renewable while having the support of the members of the High College Fraters. 
The basic structures of Rosicrucian Societies are called Colleges. At present, there are Colleges under SRIL&#x27;s jurisdiction in the North and Central/South of Portugal Provinces and in the North, Central and South of Italy Provinces. There are currently petitions for the constitution of a new College in the Center of Portugal. The Supreme Magus has his own College, called the Metropolitan College.
Cavaleiro Grande Cruz (CGC) — Knight Grand Cross is the SRIL&#x27;s most important High Council award. It is awarded to Supreme Magi of brother jurisdictions and IX grade Magi members for outstanding services.
The SRIL bi-annual publication is called &quot;Demanda&quot;.

==Structure and governance==
The Order is subdivided into three smaller orders, each with its own governance. The various orders confer a total of nine degrees, here called &quot;grades&quot;.

===First Order===
Members of the 1st Order (Frater (singular) Fratres (plural)) meet in a College, which is equivalent to a Lodge. A College is empowered to confer the first four degrees of the Society, also called the &quot;Learning Grades&quot;.

*Grade I - Zelator
*Grade II - Theoricus
*Grade III - Practicus
*Grade IV - Philosophus

A minimum of six months must elapse between the receipt of each grade. The emphasis on the work of the society is learning; therefore every member is encouraged to deliver a paper of their own work on some topic of interest in open college.

===Second Order===
This is equivalent to a Masonic Provincial Grand Lodge, and is headed by a &quot;Chief Adept&quot; and his deputy (Suffragan) who have jurisdiction over all of the first order Colleges within the Province.

The Chief Adept is empowered to confer three further Grades at this level to deserving &quot;Fratres&quot; of Grade IV who have been members of the Society for a minimum of four years.
*Grade V - Adeptus Minor
*Grade VI - Adeptus Major
*Grade VII - Adeptus Exemptus

A minimum of one year must elapse between the receipt of grades at this level. A member can only serve as the Celebrant (Master) of a College of the First Order after receiving the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus.

===Third Order===
This is equivalent to a Grand Lodge, and is headed by a Supreme Magus, Senior Substitute Magus and Junior Substitute Magus.

Members of the second order who have given service to the society and been selected by the Supreme Magus for such advancement may be awarded two further Grades.
*Grade VIII - Magister
*Grade IX - Magus

==Influences==

===Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn===
In 1888, three members of SRIA, William Robert Woodman, William Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, formed the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which removed the restriction on membership, allowing non-Christians, non-Freemasons, and women to join. A great deal of the SRIA structure survived in the new order, which went on to greatly influence the modern Western occult revival in the 20th century.

===Societas Rosicruciana in America (SRIAm)===
Due to the fragmentary nature of Rosicrucian orders, there are a number of historical Rosicrucian societies with similar names that either no longer have a Masonic connection, or have gone dormant: The SRIA (A for &quot;America&quot;) was chartered by the SRIA (in England) in Philadelphia in 1878. It reformed in 1889 as Societas Rosicruciana in the United States (SRIUS), and reformed again as SRIA in 1912. In 1916 the order began admitting women, and its charter was revoked. It is in existence today, but has no Masonic connections whatsoever.

In 1879, a College was established in Philadelphia, Pa., under warrant from the High Council of Scotia (Scotland) by a number of Americans who visited England and received their degrees from York College of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. Colleges were established soon after 1879 in New York, Boston, and Burlington, Vt., and were recognized in full by the S.R.I. Anglia; they organized their own High Council, and the body thus constituted became known as the Societatis Rosicrucianae in the United States, admitting only 32nd degree Masons.

A member of Massachusetts College, in Boston, having received the VIII Degree constituting him a Provincial Magus, engaged in special research work. He later received his IX Degree direct from Apponyi, a leading Rosicrucian in Hungary, constituting him a Prince Chief Adept and Magus. The American organization being largely inoperative at the time, he undertook the formation and institution of a branch of the Fraternity in the Western Hemisphere that would devote itself exclusively and assiduously to the true Rosicrucian Art and Operation, open to both sexes on a basis of true equality. The transition of this member, Illustrious Frater Sylvester Clarke Gould, late of Manchester, N. H., on July 19, 1909, prevented the fulfillment of his personal ambition, and the actual work of organization and institution devolved upon the Imperator and Supreme Magus of the Society, George Winslow Plummer, who had received full initiation and authority to begin the work in New York from Frater Gould before his passing.

<text>Michael William Gatting (born 6 June 1957) is an English former cricketer, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex (1975–1998; captain 1983–1997) and for England from 1977 to 1995, captaining the national side in twenty-three Test matches between 1986 and 1988. He toured South Africa as captain of the rebel tour party in 1990. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1979 Cricket World Cup and captain of the squad which finished as runners-up at the 1987 Cricket World Cup.

He replaced John Buchanan as the county coach, serving during 1999 and 2000.

He is currently an elected member of the Middlesex C.C.C. Executive Board and the M.C.C. Committee. He has previously served as the ECB managing director of Cricket Partnerships and President of Marylebone Cricket Club

Cricket writer Colin Bateman has stated that &quot;talk of Gatting the batsman always evokes adjectives such as pugnacious, bold, brave and belligerent&quot;.

== Youth career ==
As a youngster, Gatting became first batsman to score a century on Youth ODI debut in 1976. He scored 126 runs in that innings against the West Indies U19&#x27;s.

==Career==
Before playing cricket professionally, Gatting used to play football for Watford reserves. As a fourteen-year-old goalkeeper on trial at Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers, Gatting was told that he was too short and overweight to make the grade. Gatting also went on an unfruitful trial with fellow Londoners Arsenal F.C. That being so, he turned to cricket for his sporting future and QPR signed the other trialist that day, Phil Parkes.

In domestic cricket, Gatting was one of the most prolific batsmen in England for most of his career, but it took him several years to establish himself in the England team. He initially had great difficulty converting fifties into centuries at Test match level and he did not achieve a Test century until his fifty-fourth Test innings; he went on to accumulate ten hundreds in all. His highest Test score of 207 was scored in Madras. Graeme Fowler also scored a double century in the same innings; it remains the only occasion where two English batsmen scored double centuries in the same innings of a test match. Gatting later captained England to an Ashes series victory in Australia in 1986/87.

During a one-day match in 1986, Gatting&#x27;s nose was shattered by a ferocious delivery from West Indies fast bowler Malcolm Marshall. Marshall later found shards of the nose embedded in the ball&#x27;s leather. The incident set the tone for the series as the West Indies&#x27; fearsome pace attack spearheaded England&#x27;s thrashing 5–0.

Another mishap for which Gatting will be remembered is being caught by Australian wicketkeeper Greg Dyer, after trying to play a reverse sweep off opposing captain Allan Border&#x27;s first ball during the 1987 World Cup final.

In 1987, Gatting gained notoriety in the &quot;Shakoor Rana affair&quot; when he argued with umpire Shakoor Rana in Faisalabad. He was accused of adjusting the field illegally, i.e. after the bowler had started running in, and warned. In fact, Gatting had been signalling to the long leg fielder to stop walking in, and the move was legal as it was not in the batsman&#x27;s eyeline. Rana shouted &#x27;stop, stop&#x27; and signalled dead ball, however, infuriating Gatting. Tempers were already frayed following a string of umpiring decisions that had gone against England, and the England team were unhappy that Rana was wearing a Pakistan sweater under his jacket. An on-pitch argument ensued, during the course of which Rana accused Gatting of breaking the rules and Gatting shouted &#x27;We made the rules&#x27;. He had to be dragged away by Bill Athey. Rana refused to resume the match the following morning until Gatting delivered a handwritten apology, which he did under protest – eventually, the match was drawn due to bad light. The England hierarchy supported him, flying officials out to mediate with the board and deal with press relations. The Pakistan board supported Rana, naming him umpire for the deciding Test, from which position they only backed down when it was clear the England team would not play if Rana officiated, naming two other umpires. Indeed, the TCCB subsequently paid all players in the England party a £1000 &#x27;hardship&#x27; bonus for the tour.

Martin Williamson, editor of Cricinfo, subsequently commented of the incident, &#x27;Whatever the provocation, Gatting was in the wrong.&#x27; Gatting also reflected later that &#x27;it wasn&#x27;t a very proud moment of my career.&#x27; He also admitted that, whatever the official reason given, it was the real reason why he lost the England captaincy the following summer. However, it went a long way towards establishing the principle of neutral umpires to prevent blatant bias by home country umpires, which had not always been the case previously. Rana said he did it &#x27;for umpires everywhere&#x27;.

Gatting was sacked as England captain the following summer over an alleged encounter with a barmaid, triggering the &quot;summer of four captains&quot;. He subsequently led a highly controversial rebel tour to South Africa. Gatting hit the headlines during the tour for describing a protest outside the rebel team&#x27;s hotel as &quot;a few people singing and dancing&quot;. The rebels received three-year international bans. 

In June 1993, during England&#x27;s first innings at Old Trafford, Gatting received Shane Warne&#x27;s first delivery – now known as the &quot;Ball of the Century&quot; – in an Ashes match. Warne pitched the ball a foot outside leg stump and spun the ball past Gatting&#x27;s bat to clip the off bail. Gatting&#x27;s dismissal in the second innings was also unusual, in that he was bowled off the very last ball of the fourth day&#x27;s play by Merv Hughes, meaning he was unable to help England bat out the last day. Australia went on to win during the last session on that last day.

Gatting&#x27;s last Tests were played on tour in Australia in 1994/95. Graham Gooch and he were the only two members of the original touring party to be fit for all matches, although they were the two oldest in the squad. In the first innings of the Adelaide Test he scored his final century (117), a battling effort where he spent a lot of time in the nineties. His score helped England to their only win in the series.

Gatting was a useful right arm medium pace bowler. He averaged under thirty with the ball in both first-class and List A cricket, but he did not bowl with great frequency in International cricket. Perhaps his finest bowling performance was against South Africa during the final One Day International of the 1989/90 rebel England tour to South Africa where his 6/26 helped England to a comfortable 134-run victory.

Gatting was named as one of Wisden&#x27;s five Cricketers of the Year in 1984. In 1987, he was awarded an OBE.

==Retirement==

He retired from first-class cricket in 1998 and has since worked as a coach and commentator. He is also a Past President of the Lord&#x27;s Taverners for 2005–06 and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) for 2013–14. He is currently in his second term as an elected member of the MCC committee and is also a co-opted member of the Middlesex C.C.C. Executive Board. Since October 2017 he has been the chairman of MCC&#x27;s World Cricket committee.

Mike Gatting is not the only member of his family to have been a professional sportsman; his brother, Steve Gatting, was a professional footballer for Arsenal and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Steve&#x27;s son, Joe, played for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, having progressed from their youth scheme, and later played professional cricket for Sussex and Hampshire between 2009 and 2015.

He appeared as himself on &quot;The Archers&quot; on 9 September 2007 at the centre of a misunderstanding between Sid and Jolene Perks during the npower Village Cup Final at Lord&#x27;s.

In May 2013, it was announced that he would be the President of Marylebone Cricket Club and helm it during bicentenary of Lord&#x27;s and also Middlesex will celebrate the 150th anniversary of its formation. 

Gatting Way, the road in Uxbridge that leads from Park Road to the Uxbridge Cricket Club Ground, of which Middlesex County Cricket Club are tenants, is named after Mike Gatting.

<text>Graham Alan Gooch, (born 23 July 1953) is a former English first-class cricketer who captained Essex and England. He was one of the most successful international batsmen of his generation, and through a career spanning 1973 until 1997, he was the most prolific run scorer of all time, with 67,057 runs across first-a class and limited-overs games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records / Combined First-class, List A and Twenty20 / Batting records / Most runs in career&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His List A cricket tally of 22,211 runs is also a record. In 1992, he became the first cricketer to lose 3 finals of the Cricket World Cup and is currently the only such player. He is one of only 25 players to have scored over 100 first-class centuries. He was a part of the English squads which finished as runners-up at the 1979 Cricket World Cup, as runners-up at the 1987 Cricket World Cup and as runners-up at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

Internationally, despite being banned for three years following a rebel tour to ostracized South Africa, Gooch is the third highest Test run scorer for England. His playing years spanned much of the period of domination by the West Indies, against whom his mid-forties batting average is regarded as extremely creditable. His score of 154 against them at Headingley in 1991 is regarded as one of the greatest centuries of all time by many critics and former players. His career-best score of 333 was against India at Lord&#x27;s. In that match, he also scored a century in the second innings, 123, for a match total of 456, which remains the highest aggregate in a test match. He was the first player to make 20 Test
appearances at Lord&#x27;s. As captain, Matthew Engel noted, &quot;his fanatical fitness and work-ethic gave the team more purpose than it had shown in a decade.&quot;

After 118 Tests, aged 42, he retired into coaching and as team selector, before becoming a commentator. In 2009 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He returned to coach Essex, before becoming England batting coach in 2012.

==Overview==
Gooch was born in Whipps Cross University Hospital, Leytonstone, London. He was educated at Norlington School for Boys and Leyton County High School for Boys, in Leyton.

Gooch played first-class cricket regularly between 1973 and 1997. Famous for his upright stance, a high bat-lift and heavy bat he became one of the most prolific run scorers top-class cricket has ever seen. On 8 November 2011, he received an honorary award from the University of East London.

==Test cricket==

===Early years===
Gooch made his debut in Test cricket in 1975 at 21 against the touring Australia side captained by Ian Chappell. His debut was not a great success as Gooch got a pair, and England lost the first Test by an innings and 85 runs. In the second Ashes Test in the series he scored 6 and 31 and was then dropped from the side. He was not selected for the Test team again until 1978 (although making his one-day international debut in 1976), when his scoring rate for Essex meant that he could not be ignored and he became a mainstay in the England line-up. On his return to Test cricket he immediately had more success, making a first Test half-century, and 91 not out in his fifth Test, although it was his 22nd Test and five years after his debut before he made his first Test (or any international) century. In 1980 he was awarded the Wisden Cricketer of the Year. His first three Test centuries all came against the West Indies.

Gooch had a further hiatus in his career when he went on the controversial 1982 South African rebel tour, which resulted in all of the players concerned, including Geoff Boycott, Alan Knott and Bob Woolmer, being banned from Test cricket for three years. Geoffrey Boycott was generally perceived as the key player organising the tour party but it was Graham Gooch as captain of the team who gained the most media attention and in some cases vilification. Gooch was not handed the captaincy until the team arrived in South Africa at the beginning of March. It could be argued that more attention was on Gooch however as he was reaching his peak as a Test player, others were in the twilight years of their cricket careers and so the ban was arguably felt more acutely by the captain. Gooch claimed in the film &quot;Out of the Wilderness&quot; that &#x27;others&#x27; decided he &quot;had no place in England cricket&quot;, hence his decision to join the tour.

===Later years===
Upon the expiration of the ban, Gooch was restored to the England team in 1985. Opting to miss the 1986–87 tour of Australia for personal reasons, a severe loss of form resulted in failing to win back his England place for the 1987 summer and Test series against Pakistan – indeed at one stage he was even dropped to the Second XI at Essex, but his form returned at the end of the summer, with a superb century in the MCC Bicentennial match. He returned to the England team for the Cricket World Cup in India and Pakistan, and the subsequent winter tour of Pakistan. His career blossomed later after being appointed captain, a position he held twice: first briefly, at the end of the &quot;summer of four captains&quot; in 1988, as a replacement for the injured Chris Cowdrey (who never played another Test). In his first match (the fifth and last of the series against the West Indies), England at least showed some spirit, taking a first-innings lead for the only time in the series. Gooch&#x27;s second-innings 84 stood alone as the rest of the batting collapsed, England losing the match (and with it the series 4–0). His second match, the one-off Test against Sri Lanka, was won, and all seemed set fair for Gooch to remain as captain for the tour of India that winter. But that tour was cancelled over the Indian government&#x27;s refusal to grant visas to the eight players who had sporting links with South Africa, including Gooch himself. David Gower returned as captain for the losing 1989 Ashes series – in which, for a second time, Gooch&#x27;s loss of form with the bat resulted in his being dropped, by his own request this time.

===Cricket World Cups===
Graham Gooch played in 3 different world cups in 3 decades - the 1979 Cricket World Cup, the 1987 Cricket World Cup, and the 1992 Cricket World Cup. He has the distinction of featuring in the finals of all the three World Cups that he played in. He would probably be best remembered in the competition for the stupendous century in the 1987 semi-final against India at the Wankhede Stadium when he repeatedly swept the spinners to carry England into the final. England made the finals in 1979 in their home ground to take on the mighty West Indies. Gooch top scored with 71 in 83 balls (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Cricket_World_Cup?wprov=sfla1), in the semi final win over New Zealand. The West Indies scored 286 for the loss of 9 wickets in 60 overs with Vivian Richards hammering an unbeaten 138. In reply, England had an impressive start with 129 for no loss. They lost openers Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott in quick succession but Gooch and Derek Randall held it together. They added 48 runs for the third wicket and once Gooch was castled by Joel Garner on 32, the English side collapsed like a pack of cards. From 183 for 2, England were all out for 194, losing the final by 92 runs. In 1987 Cricket World Cup Final, Powered by David Boon&#x27;s 75, Australia posted 253 for the loss of 5 wickets in 50 overs. The fateful reverse sweep by English skipper Mike Gatting at a crucial moment of the match saw his team losing the way after a good start and England fell short of Australia&#x27;s score by just 7 runs. Gooch scored 35 off 57 balls as an opener in that match. Gooch was the leading run-scorer in the 1987 Cricket World Cup. In the 1992 Cricket World Cupfinal, Pakistani skipper Imran Khan won the toss and scored a 72 to propel his team to a formidable 249 for 6 wickets in 50 overs. Gooch had an ordinary outing this time, scoring 29 off 66 balls with just one boundary. They lost to Pakistan by 22 runs. Graham Gooch is the second highest run-scorer for England in World cups, with 897 runs in 21 innings at an average of 44.85 and strike rate of 63.25. He scored one century and eight fifties. His highest score of 115 was against India in Mumbai in 1987.

===Full-time captain===
After Gower&#x27;s resignation following the 4–0 Ashes defeat of 1989, and the loss of a large number of players with Test experience to a second rebel tour of South Africa under Gatting, Gooch was re-appointed captain for the 1989–90 winter tour of the West Indies. England unexpectedly won the first Test, which was England&#x27;s first victory over the Windies since 1973 and came close to winning the third Test. However, Gooch suffered a broken hand and missed the rest of the tour – England lost the two remaining matches and the series.

Returning for the summer of 1990, Gooch had a golden summer both as batsman and captain against India and New Zealand, scoring runs seemingly at will. Gooch scored a record 456 runs in the Lord&#x27;s Test against India in 1990, 333 in the first innings and 123 in the second. Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka (in 2014) is the only other player to score a triple century in the first innings and a century in the second innings. His aggregate of 456 for the match remains a world record for a Test match, as does his aggregate of 752 for the 3-match series. Both series were won, and in 1990 Gooch was awarded the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association Player of the Year.

The winter tour of Australia did not, however, go according to plan, England losing 3–0 despite holding first-innings leads in the first two tests (both of which were lost), although Gooch scored a marvellous hundred chasing an improbable total in the drawn 4th test.

Gooch had a public falling-out with David Gower, the England batsman, particularly after Gower hired a vintage aircraft and &#x27;buzzed&#x27; the ground where England was playing during the unsuccessful tour of Australia in 1990/91. Gooch contributed to the decision to omit Gower from England&#x27;s tour of India in 1993, which proved so controversial that an extraordinary vote of no confidence in the selectors was passed at the MCC. Gower never played another Test, lending an ironic edge to Gooch&#x27;s surpassing him as England&#x27;s leading run scorer in the 1993 Ashes series. It is this relationship between the two men that perhaps highlights best the differences between their approaches to the game, as Gower himself identified in 1995 in an interview in The Independent &quot;I was never destined to be on the ball 100 per cent of the time. I don&#x27;t have the same ability that Graham Gooch has, to produce something very close to his best every time he plays.&#x27;

In 1991 at Headingley against the West Indies he scored a match-winning 154 not out, carrying his bat throughout England&#x27;s second innings against a highly rated pace attack, in overcast conditions on an unpredictable pitch, while only two of his colleagues reached double figures in a total of 252. The veteran sportswriter Frank Keating rated this as the finest Test innings he had ever seen in England. This opinion was backed up by the ICC rankings, which listed it as the highest-ranking innings of all time at any venue. In the rest of the series (drawn 2–2), Gooch was one of England&#x27;s most consistent run-scorers, although no further centuries followed.

Gooch made a habit of leading by example, his batting average as captain (58.6) being almost twice his average in the ranks (36). New Zealand were beaten in the winter tour of 1991–92, the decisive Second Test including another Gooch century (which he described as his worst ever, but his luckiest). He also led England to the World Cup final later that winter, and batted well during the 1992 series defeat by Pakistan – again, his runs contributing to England&#x27;s series-levelling victory in the fourth Test.

After the fourth Test match of the 1993 Ashes series, and with England now 3–0 down in the series, he resigned as captain: the job being given to his fellow opening batsman, Mike Atherton. He continued playing for England for a couple of years, notably scoring another double century against New Zealand in 1994, and retired from test cricket as England&#x27;s all-time highest run scorer. Over his 118 Test career, Gooch played with a record 113 different teammates.

==First-class==
Gooch made his debut for Essex in 1973 at the age of 19, and played for the county until his retirement as a player in 1997. For Essex, Gooch scored 120 in the 1979 Benson and Hedges Cup final against Surrey, a match which saw Essex win a major domestic trophy for the first time in their history. This heralded a highly successful period for the county, with Gooch a key member of a team that won the county championship six times in the years 1979–1992, and also won every other major domestic trophy at least once in the same period. Gooch holds numerous Essex batting records: in particular he scored the most first-class runs in a season (2559, scored in 1984 while banned from playing for England), and made more first-class centuries (94) for the county than any other player. The Essex record partnership for the second wicket was set by Gooch and Paul Prichard.

Gooch also bowled occasional medium pace, and took over 200 first-class wickets. He could be a prodigious swinger of the ball if conditions suited. In dead matches he could sometimes be seen doing impressions of fellow professionals&#x27; bowling styles.

Upon his retirement, Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote an article in Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack arguing that Gooch was the all-time highest run scorer in top level cricket. He scored 44,846 runs in all first-class cricket at an average of 49.01, including 128 centuries. (A number of players have scored more first-class runs.) Martin-Jenkins took into consideration Gooch&#x27;s List A matches, in which he scored a further 22,211 runs, itself a world record.

==Cricket coach==

In October 2001, Gooch returned to his beloved Essex in the capacity of head coach, taking over from Keith Fletcher. Gooch held this role until stepping down in March 2005 to Paul Prichard, his long running opening partner. Gooch remains at the club, continuing as the squad&#x27;s specialist batting coach whilst also assuming commercial duties for the county.

In November 2009 Gooch was selected as a &quot;temporary&quot; batting coach for the impending four test tour of South Africa and to support ex-Essex colleague, Head England Coach Andy Flower.

He has since remained as England&#x27;s batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch&#x27;s influence on England&#x27;s and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England&#x27;s batting (or &#x27;run-scoring&#x27;, as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.

In March 2012 Gooch took the full-time role as England Batting coach which came in the wake of the disappointing three-match Test series against Pakistan, in which England were beaten 3–0, largely down to the failure of their batsmen. &quot;I am delighted to be taking on the role of England batting coach on a full-time basis,&quot; said Gooch, &quot;I will now have the opportunity to spend a lot more time with the players and other coaches both in the build-up to series and during the series themselves.&quot;

==Outside cricket==
He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1990, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at a gathering of the England Cricket Team in the Excelsior Hotel at Heathrow Airport.

In the mid-1990s Gooch began promoting hairpieces for a London-based clinic, as well as the Australian-based Advanced Hair Studio. Two licensed computer games were made by Audiogenic, Graham Gooch&#x27;s Test Cricket in 1985 and Graham Gooch World Class Cricket in 1993.

He made a one-off return to first-class cricket in July 2000, just a few days before his 47th birthday, when he captained Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against New Zealand A at The Parks. It was not a successful comeback: Gooch made only 0 and 5 in the game.

In 2007 he announced his intention to compete in a beach cricket competition against Courtney Walsh&#x27;s Team and Allan Border&#x27;s team.

In 2011 Gooch received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of East London.

Graham Gooch is a West Ham United supporter. In 2014, he was appointed patron of The Rob George Foundation.

<doc id="413177" wikidata="Q7194927" url="?curid=413177" title="Pincherle derivative">
<text>In mathematics, the Pincherle derivative formula_1 of a linear operator formula_2 on the vector space of polynomials in the variable &quot;x&quot; over a field formula_3 is the commutator of formula_4 with the multiplication by &quot;x&quot; in the algebra of endomorphisms formula_5. That is, formula_1 is another linear operator formula_7

:formula_8

(for the origin of the formula_9 notation, see the article on the adjoint representation) so that 

:formula_10

This concept is named after the Italian mathematician Salvatore Pincherle (1853–1936).

== Properties ==
The Pincherle derivative, like any commutator, is a derivation, meaning it satisfies the sum and products rules: given two linear operators formula_11 and formula_4 belonging to formula_13

#formula_14;
#formula_15 where formula_16 is the composition of operators.

One also has formula_17 where formula_18 is the usual Lie bracket, which follows from the Jacobi identity.

The usual derivative, &quot;D&quot; = &quot;d&quot;/&quot;dx&quot;, is an operator on polynomials. By straightforward computation, its Pincherle derivative is

: formula_19

This formula generalizes to

: formula_20

by induction. This proves that the Pincherle derivative of a differential operator

: formula_21

is also a differential operator, so that the Pincherle derivative is a derivation of formula_22.

When formula_3 has characteristic zero, the shift operator

: formula_24

can be written as

: formula_25

by the Taylor formula. Its Pincherle derivative is then

: formula_26

In other words, the shift operators are eigenvectors of the Pincherle derivative, whose spectrum is the whole space of scalars formula_3.

If &quot;T&quot; is shift-equivariant, that is, if &quot;T&quot; commutes with &quot;S&quot;&quot;h&quot; or formula_28, then we also have formula_29, so that formula_1 is also shift-equivariant and for the same shift formula_31.

The &quot;discrete-time delta operator&quot;

: formula_32

is the operator

: formula_33

whose Pincherle derivative is the shift operator formula_34.

<doc id="413178" wikidata="Q1166623" url="?curid=413178" title="Darren Gough">
<text>Darren Gough (born 18 September 1970) is a retired English cricketer and former captain of Yorkshire County Cricket Club. The spearhead of England&#x27;s bowling attack through much of the 1990s, he is England&#x27;s second highest wicket-taker in one-day internationals with 235, and took 229 wickets in his 58 Test matches, making him England&#x27;s ninth-most-successful wicket-taker.

Gough was a right arm fast bowler and right-handed batsman. At 5 feet 11 inches in height and broad in beam, he achieved his pace from a good approach to the wicket and a leaping sideways-on action, achieving what was often described as &quot;skiddy&quot; fast bowling. Capable of swinging the ball late, many of his wickets were gained through lbw or bowled, often with an inswinging yorker delivery.

Gough retired at the end of the 2008 cricket season with Justin Langer as his final first-class wicket. He won the third series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2005.

==Domestic cricket==
Gough was offered a contract by Yorkshire cricket and Rotherham United but chose cricket. He made his first class debut in 1989 against Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s taking five wickets. He won his county cap in 1993 after taking 7/42 against Somerset.

Gough played county cricket for 15 years for Yorkshire and was a member of their 2001 squad that won the 2001 County Championship – its first in 33 years. In 2004 he moved to Essex and returned to Yorkshire for the 2007 season as their captain.

Gough retired in 2008.

His only First-Class century came against Warwickshire in 1996 at Headingley.

==International cricket==

===1994 England vs New Zealand===
After a breakout season in 1993, Gough went on an A tour to South Africa, following by making his Test debut for England against New Zealand at Old Trafford. Gough was England&#x27;s 568th Test cricketer. With a wicket in his first over and his highest Test score of 65 it was quite the debut.

===1994 England vs South Africa===
Gough retained his place for his first full home series against South Africa. Gough started well with a pair of four wickets in the first Test and would pick up another 3 to be leading English wicket taker in the series. He played in his first Test victory in the third Test. In the second innings he took the only wicket that Devon Malcolm didn&#x27;t take when he took 9/57. With the bat he averaged 40 for the series.

===1994–95 Australia vs England===
On the back of this, Gough was a member of his first Ashes squad. With the England team thoroughly outclassed, Gough played a solo hand taking 20 wickets at 21.25. The highlight was five wickets in an innings and scoring a 50 in Sydney where he was also man of the match.

There was a break for the limited over series – Gough injured his foot bowling his first ball in a match at the MCG and was taken to hospital. X-rays revealed a stress fracture in his foot and he missed the final two Tests of the series.

===1995 England vs West Indies===
Gough returned for this series playing in the first three of the six Test series. After six wickets in the first two tests he was wicketless in the third.

===1995–1996 South Africa vs England===
Gough was wicketless in the first two Tests of the series.

===1996–1997 Zimbabwe vs England===
Gough played in both tests of the two Test series, the first of which was the first match in the history of Test cricket to finish in a draw with the scores level. With three runs needed from the final ball, Nick Knight while batting with Gough was run out attempting the game winning third run.

===1996–1997 New Zealand vs England===
Gough played all three Tests of the series. In the second Test he took five and four wickets for his best match figures of 9/92.

===1997 England vs Australia===
Gough played in the first four Tests of the series. England started full of energy winning the First Test at Edgbaston. It was the only live Ashes Test England would win between 1987 and 2005. Gough took six wickets in the first Test and would take 10 in the next four. Once again injury prevented Gough from playing as an inflamed knee caused him to miss the final two tests.

===1998 England vs South Africa===
Gough was back for the South African series and played in the four of the five tests. England was down 1–0 with 2 to play. Only down 1–0 thanks to Gough&#x27;s heroics at Old Trafford where he batted over an hour with Robert Croft to save the game for England.

England won the Fourth Test to level the series 1–1. The series was heading for a grand finale at Headingley, Gough&#x27;s home ground. Chasing 219 for victory, South Africa were 5/27 when Gough took the wickets of Gary Kirsten, Gerhardus Liebenberg and Daryl Cullinan. Gough took his 100th career wicket when he had Jonty Rhodes caught. The final morning began with South Africa needing 34 runs with 2 wickets in hand. Gough dismissed Makhaya Ntini to seal the game. Gough finished with 6/42 his best innings figures in test cricket. It was England&#x27;s first home five-Test series win since 1985.

===1998 England vs Sri Lanka===
Following that England played Sri Lanka for a one-off test at The Oval. It was the first time in 50 years that England lost after scoring more than 440 in the first innings. England collapsed badly on the final day losing 8/127 in 87 overs. Gough batted for 133 balls and 145 minutes in resisting but was Muttiah Muralitharan&#x27;s 9th wicket of the innings.

===1998–99 Australia vs England===
It was a return down under for the Ashes. Gough played in all five Tests of the series. Gough took 10 wickets in the first three Tests but would secure cricketing immortality in the final two Tests.

In the 4th Test in Melbourne, Australia, chasing 175 for victory, were 3/130 but a collapse of 4/0 left them struggling. Steve Waugh and Matthew Nicholson took Australia to 161 before Dean Headley dismissed Nicholson. Stuart MacGill faced the final ball of that Headley over. With the first ball of the next over, Steve Waugh took a single off Gough. Gough bowled MacGill with a searing yorker that hit the base of middle stump and two balls later had Glenn McGrath lbw to give England a 12 run win. It was Gough&#x27;s only Test Victory in Australia and was remembered by his exuberant celebrations of shaking a stump over his head.

Four days later the 5th Test began in Sydney. Australia batted first and moved to 6/321. Wicketless until then, Gough had Ian Healy caught behind, next ball he ripped out MacGill&#x27;s middle stump and with his final ball of the over bowled Colin Miller. It was the first Ashes hat trick by an Englishman in almost a 100 years and the first hat trick taken in Sydney in almost 107 years.

Gough was the leading English wicket taker for the series with 21.

===1999–2000 South Africa vs England===
It was almost a year until Gough would next play Test cricket as England toured South Africa. Gough played all five Tests of the series. South Africa were leading 2–0 heading into the Fifth Test which became one of the most infamous tests in cricket history. With no play possible on Days 2, 3 and 4, Cronje and Hussain agreed to forfeit an innings to give England a final day run chase of 249. It later turned out that Cronje was bribed 50,000 rand to ensure a result. 
Gough hit the winning runs to give England the 2 wicket victory.

===2000 Zimbabwe vs England===
Gough played both Tests in the 2 match series against Zimbabwe taking 9 wickets.

===2000 England vs West Indies===
Statistically this was Gough&#x27;s finest series. He took 25 wickets – his most in any series and was named joint player of the series with Courtney Walsh. England won the series 3–1 giving them their first series victory against the West Indies in 31 years.

West Indies won the first Test at Edgbaston by an innings and 93 runs. The West Indies continued their momentum into the 2nd Test at Lords when they took a 133 run lead into the second innings. West Indies were bowled out for 54 to give England a chase of 188. From 1/95 England collapsed to 8/160. Gough joined Dominic Cork with 28 still needed for victory. Gough was still there when Cork hit the winning runs.

The Third Test was a draw before England won the Fourth Test in 2 days. Gough took 7 wickets for the match.

In the Fifth Test, England had too much momentum for a fatigued visitors who lost by 158 runs. Gough took four wickets for the match including the vital wicket of Brian Lara – the fifth time he dismissed him in the series.

===2000–01 Pakistan vs England===
England toured Pakistan for a Three Test series. After the first two matches were drawn, England won the third in fading light to record their first Test victory and first Test series victory in Pakistan in almost 40 years. Gough took 10 wickets for the series.

===2000–01 Sri Lanka vs England===
England continued on their winning ways with a 2–1 series victory in Sri Lanka. England bounced back after losing the first Test. Gough took 14 wickets for the series, the most by an English player.

===2001 England vs Pakistan===
The 2 test series was tied 1–1. Gough played in both matches and took 14 wickets. His 5/61 in his 50th test not only put him on the honours board but was also his 200th Test wicket.

===2001 England vs Australia===
Australia came for the Ashes. Gough played in all 5 Tests and took 17 wickets, the most by an Englishman. Australia won the series 4–1 with England&#x27;s win coming in the 4th Test.

===2003 England vs South Africa===
After almost 2 years out of Test cricket, Gough returned to play South Africa. The first Test was a draw and South Africa won the second by an innings and 92 runs. Gough only took one wicket.

The rigors of Test match cricket were proving too much for Gough&#x27;s body and he retired.

==One Day International Cricket==
Gough made his one-day debut for England against New Zealand taking 2/36 from 11 overs at Birmingham in 42 run win.

===1996 World Cup===
Gough played in all six of England&#x27;s matches in the 1996 World Cup. He took a collective 4/238 from 51 overs.

===1999 World Cup===
Gough played in all five of England&#x27;s matches and had 11/192 from 48.4 overs.

==T20I Cricket==
Gough only played 2 T20I matches. Against Australia in 2005 and Pakistan in 2006.

==Legacy==
England only won 18 times in the 58 times Gough played. Gough played Australia 17 times and was only on the winning side 3 times. 
This combined with his many injuries meant his exploits weren&#x27;t always associated with winning Test Matches. &quot;The few times it was, there was no better cricketer in the world. 
Just as he was hitting his peak his body betrayed him and he constantly battled knee injuries.&quot;

Gough played 146 first-class matches for Yorkshire, taking 453 wickets at 27.56.
He took 290 wickets in 212 List A games at 23.34 and 16 wickets in 17 Twenty20 appearances at 26.00.
Of his 229 dismissals, Ricky Ponting and Michael Slater featured the most – eight times each.

==Honours==
* His 234 ODI wickets is still the second most for England. 
* First England bowler to take 200 ODI wickets
* Eighth England bowler to take 200 Test Wickets
* 6th Fastest England bowler to take 200 Test Wickets
* 1999 Wisden cricketer of the year
* 2000 Cornhill England player of the year
* 2001 Vodafone England cricket of the year

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while launching a NatWest competition for junior cricketers at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

In 2006, Gough was awarded an honorary degree by Huddersfield University in Barnsley. An honorary doctorate of civil law from the University of Huddersfield.

In the same year he was awarded honorary life membership by Yorkshire Cricket Club.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to cricket and charity.

==Coaching and administrative career==
In October 2019, Gough was appointed as a fast bowling consultant for England cricket team for test matches against New Zealand.
In December 2021, Gough was appointed the director of cricket for Yorkshire. He left the role in March 2024.
In November 2024, Gough was appointed as the head coach of Lahore Qalandars for the upcoming 2024 Global Super League in Guyana.

==After cricket==
Gough was on a &quot;Question of Sport&quot;. 
Gough has been on Talk Sport since 2009.
 He co-presented the weekday afternoon drive-time show with Adrian Durham.

In 2005, Gough took part in the BBC television show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnered with British National champion Lilia Kopylova. He was the first cricketer to win the show, a feat former teammate Mark Ramprakash would emulate the following year. He went on to win both the main series and the 2005 Christmas Special.Two years later he returned to win the 2007 Christmas Special. Following this he took part in the Strictly Come Dancing live tour during January and February 2008.

In 2009, Gough became the face of UK convenience store chain Costcutter, featuring in their TV adverts until 2011.

<text>Oswald Ludwig Pohl (; 30 June 1892 – 7 June 1951) was a German SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; during the Nazi era. As the head of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office and the head administrator of the Nazi concentration camps, he was a key figure in the Final Solution, the genocide of the European Jews. After the war, Pohl went into hiding; he was apprehended in 1946. Pohl stood trial in 1947, was convicted of crimes against humanity, and sentenced to death. After repeatedly appealing his case, he was executed by hanging in 1951.

== Early life and career ==
Oswald Pohl was born in Duisburg-Ruhrort on 30 June 1892 to blacksmith, Hermann Otto Emil Pohl, and his wife Auguste Pohl (née Seifert); he was the fifth of eight children. His parents were financially secure, and he attended a &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; where he studied classical Greek and Latin texts. From what Pohl claimed, he always wanted to study science but his father did not have the means to send him straight to university. In 1912, he became a sailor in the Imperial Navy. During World War I, he served in the Baltic Sea region and the coast of Flanders. Pohl attended a navy school, and became paymaster on 1 April 1918. On 30 October of the same year, he married.

After the end of the war, Pohl attended courses at a trade school, and began studying law and state theory at the Christian-Albrechts-Universität in Kiel. He dropped out of university, and became paymaster for the Freikorps &quot;Brigade Löwenfeld&quot;, working in Berlin, Upper Silesia and the Ruhr basin. In 1920, like many others involved in the Lüttwitz-Kapp Putsch, he was accepted into the Weimar Republic&#x27;s new navy, the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;. Pohl was transferred to Swinemünde in 1924.

== SS career ==
In 1925, Pohl became a member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), then joined the re-founded Nazi Party on 22 February 1926 (membership number 30,842). Pohl proclaimed in 1932, &quot;I was a National Socialist before National Socialism came into being.&quot; Commissioned as an SA-&quot;Sturmführer&quot; in August 1932, he advanced to SA-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; in June 1933 and to SA-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; in August 1933. He met Heinrich Himmler in 1933, coming to his attention at the behest of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris who described Pohl as an &quot;energetic&quot; officer and a &quot;dedicated Nazi&quot;. Pohl quickly made himself available to the younger Himmler after their first meeting at a Kiel Biergarten. While he already presided over as many as 500 men in his role in the German Navy, as a dedicated Nazi, he jumped at the chance to be a commissioned officer in Himmler&#x27;s &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Pohl promised Himmler that he would serve him always and rose quickly due to his &quot;ruthlessness&quot; and his unwavering &quot;loyalty&quot;. He entered the SS with an effective date of 1 February 1934 (SS number 147,614) with the rank of SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;.

Pohl set to work, putting his 20-plus years of administrative experience into action; he managed to successfully standardize and professionalize the SS accounting operations, so much so that it was able to withstand a public audit, which garnered more respect from national agencies for Himmler&#x27;s SS. Pohl was quickly promoted as a result, and by 9 September 1934 was advanced to SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;. Capable administrative officers were recruited and assigned to the concentration camps due to Pohl&#x27;s efforts. Eventually Pohl was appointed chief of the administration department in the personal staff of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. His career continued to thrive when Himmler made him administrative chief over the SD Main Office and the Race and Settlement Office on 1 June 1935. He was promoted to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; the same day. Two of Pohl&#x27;s predecessors, Paul Weickert and Gerhard Schneider, were dismissed from the SS for embezzlement. Pohl founded the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Förderung und Pflege deutscher Kulturdenkmäler&quot; (&quot;Society for the preservation and fostering of German cultural monuments&quot;), which was primarily dedicated to restoring Wewelsburg, an old castle that was supposed to be turned into a cultural and scientific headquarters of the SS at Himmler&#x27;s request. The &quot;society&quot; soon became a part of Pohl&#x27;s SS administration office. Pohl left the Roman Catholic Church in 1935.

== Concentration camp administrator and WVHA chief ==

Over time, Pohl&#x27;s orbit of responsibility began to include the concentration camp system since he lived near the camp at Dachau and inspected them from time to time. He was promoted to SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; on 30 January 1937, and Himmler gave him responsibility for all SS building construction in April. During the early establishment of the concentration camps in the mid-1930s, Pohl already recognized the economic potential of forced labor. Shortly after the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; in March 1938, Pohl, who at this time was already administrative chief of the SS Main Office, accompanied Himmler to the small town of Mauthausen where it was decided that the SS-operated German Earth and Stoneworks Corporation (DEST) would begin excavating granite, using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers. Administrative and financial authority for the camps and the SS Death&#x27;s Head troops were conveyed to Pohl by 1938, which pitted him against his contemporary and peer, Theodor Eicke, particularly on matters of administration, budget, and building projects.

In June 1939 Pohl became chief of both the &quot;Verwaltung und Wirtschaft Hauptamt&quot; (VuWHA) and the &quot;Hauptamt Haushalt und Bauten&quot; (&quot;main bureau [for] budget and construction&quot;, part of the Reich&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior). He was also given an administrative government post of &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot; in the ministry. Himmler stated that: &quot;The supervision of the economic matters of these institutions (concentration camps) and their application to work is the responsibility of &quot;SS Gruppenfuehrer&quot; Pohl&quot;. The day before the Wannsee Conference, 19 January 1942, Himmler consolidated all of the offices for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (&quot;Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt&quot;; WVHA). While already a significant figure in the regime, Pohl&#x27;s appointment as chief of the WVHA strengthened his position. On 1 February 1942, Pohl was put in charge of all concentration camps, their construction, buildings, inmates and the economic benefits derived from their forced labor. On 20 April 1942, Pohl received his final promotion to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and &quot;General&quot; of the Waffen-SS. Behind Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, he eventually became the third most powerful figure in the SS. Placing Pohl&#x27;s position into perspective, historian Heinz Höhne wrote, &quot;Four potent departments placed Pohl&#x27;s hand firmly on the levers of power in the SS empire: he was in charge of the entire administration and supply of the Waffen-SS; he controlled the 20 concentration camps and 165 labor camps; he directed all SS and Police building projects; he was in charge of all SS economic enterprises.&quot;

As the head of the economics division of the SS, Pohl was appointed to run the &quot;Deutscher Wirtschaftsbetrieb&quot; (German Industrial Concern; GmbH), an organization he helped establish. It was designed to unify the massive business interests of Himmler&#x27;s SS, taking in profits from the slave labour of concentration camp prisoners. Under Pohl&#x27;s leadership, the WVHA turned its attention—once focused primarily on security and re-education—towards economic matters. To merge operations, Pohl announced the incorporation of the inspectorate of concentration camps into the WVHA on 13 March 1942. Expressing his sentiments regarding the use of prisoners for labor in a memo, Pohl wrote, &quot;SS industries [&quot;Unternehmen&quot;] have the task ... to organize a more businesslike (more productive) execution of punishment and adjust it to the overall development of the Reich.&quot; Agreeing in general terms that many of the prisoners should be worked to death, Pohl paradoxically complained about the death of some 70,610 out of 136,870 new concentration camp inmates between June and November 1942, insisting that these deaths were impeding productive output at the camp&#x27;s armament factories.

Expanding his power ever further over the economic realm, Pohl was named chairman of the board of directors for the Eastern Territories Industries Inc. (&quot;Ostindustrie GmbH&quot;) on 12 March 1943. Despite the seeming intention to use concentration camp prisoners for production in the expanding SS economics industry, Pohl&#x27;s role was also framed by the ideological mandates of exploitation and racial extermination. For example, evidence indicates that Pohl refused to allow any increases in rations for starving prisoners toiling in the Granite Works of Gross-Rosen concentration camp, when there were administrative complaints in favor of providing more food to the inmates. According to historian Michael Thad Allen, &quot;Pohl&#x27;s men prided themselves as modern administrators&quot; and often clashed with prison guards who &quot;undermined productivity&quot; by beating or killing prisoners. An irreconcilable duplicity emerged over the conflicting goals between the pragmatic economic interests of the SS under Pohl&#x27;s purview and their fanatical racialist ideological imperatives. Fulfilling a call beyond mere economic interests but one based on communal concerns prompted Pohl&#x27;s thinking when he informed the Reich&#x27;s Interior Ministry in a letter that, &quot;It is the will of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; that profits from lucrative corporations be diverted to cover the losses of others that must labor under the constraints of their non-capitalistic [&quot;nicht privatwirtschaftliche&quot;] end goals. At times these goals damn our corporations to years of future losses.&quot; In this manner, Pohl helped provide SS companies with their &quot;ideological raison d’être.&quot; Along with other SS ideologues, Pohl wanted the SS to lead the Nazi revolution through the creation of an economic base that focused on communal industrial interests versus the despised principles of western style capitalism that served individuals; in the process he intended on employing concentration camp prisoners to serve the greater interests of the Reich. For Pohl, that also meant completely &quot;exhausting forced labor.&quot;
Pohl oversaw the organization of the concentration camps, deciding on the distribution of detainees to the various camps and the &quot;rental&quot; of detainees for slave labour until 1944. The exploitation of the captives rested on the Nazi principle of &quot;extermination through labor&quot;. Human material was to be efficiently and fully exploited in the process and as former Buchenwald political prisoner and historian Eugen Kogon points out, Pohl insisted on extracting the maximum financial worth from each and every camp laborer. Kogon asserts that Pohl even created evaluative tables that calculated their value as farmed-out wage earners (minus the depreciation of food and clothing), their profit intake from valuables (watches, clothing, money) remaining after their deaths (minus crematoria expenses), and any costs recovered from selling their bones and ashes; in total, the average concentration camp inmate had a life expectancy of nine months or less and was valued at 1,630 marks. Along these lines, Pohl supervised the macabre task of collecting Jewish people&#x27;s gold fillings, hair, clothing, jewelry and other possessions. These &quot;spoils&quot;, taken from the concentration camp inmates (mostly Jews) were carefully itemized and sold at prices set by the WVHA.

In keeping with Pohl&#x27;s plan, concentration camps were to be constructed at Auschwitz, Lublin (Majdanek), and Stutthof to facilitate a &quot;vertically integrated construction and building supply enterprise.&quot; The catalyst for the expansion of SS construction initiatives stemmed from Hitler&#x27;s megalomania, namely, his plans to erect massive German cities and monuments (masterminded by architect Albert Speer) as the Reich expanded. Himmler was likewise inspired by these plans which would expand SS production and &quot;boost the status of the SS&quot;. To accomplish the job of carrying out the Führer&#x27;s vision, Pohl created the East German Building Supply Works (&quot;Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke GmbH&quot;; ODBS) along with the German Noble Furniture Corporation (&quot;Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH&quot;) with the aid of Dr. Emil Meyer, an officer in the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; and prominent figure within the Dresdner Bank.

Despite holding a &quot;nominal&quot; rank in the Waffen-SS, Pohl and the WVHA had &quot;no direct connection&quot; to the combat formations of the SS. Pohl nonetheless showed unwavering commitment to the cause and tenets of Nazism when performing his duties and stressed the importance in fulfilling the tasks outlined by Himmler. By those tasks he meant the policing duties related to the Reich&#x27;s security, those concerning the concentration camp system and industry, those duties which promoted the Nazi world-view, and any undertaking related to the &quot;Reinforcement of Germandom.&quot; Shortly before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Himmler wrote to Pohl about not needing to conceal any &quot;hidden agendas&quot; from him and emphasized the &quot;essential&quot; task of increasing &quot;good and worthy&quot; blood (Germans) through nutrition and SS settlements.
During the spring of 1942, Hitler and other Nazi elites looked to increase armaments production through the use of concentration camp inmates. This coincided with Pohl&#x27;s control over the concentration camp system. Grandiose building plans for new SS facilities in the East were laid aside in favor of arms production, which Pohl thought prudent and necessary. While Himmler and Pohl foresaw an enormous SS-operated armaments industry, they encountered opposition from the newly appointed armaments minister, Albert Speer, who undermined their initial projects. Aside from the moderately successful aircraft parts manufacturing operation at Flossenbürg concentration camp and Himmler&#x27;s boasting in October 1943 of a &quot;giant&quot; SS-run system of armament works, &quot;the SS had failed to become a serious arms manufacturer&quot;. Pohl worked in tandem with Speer for arms production, despite the latter&#x27;s lack of faith in the SS industrial complex. Satellite camps which leased out concentration camp labor spread as a result of the collaboration between the industrialists and the SS, due in part to both Pohl and Speer&#x27;s arrangements. Concentration camp inmates were not supposed to be leased-out on orders from Himmler, a directive Pohl ignored for he considered it impractical given the inability of the SS to establish production processes in short order. An enterprise overseen by Pohl and one Speer was keen on as well, was the construction works at Dora-Mittelbau, the underground complex where the V2 rockets were assembled. This enormous subterranean facility near Nordhausen in the Harz Mountains was completed in a mere two months using camp labor supplied by Pohl. Work on the prestigious wonder-weapon V1 and V2 projects remained bitterly contested between the SS and Speer&#x27;s ministry.

By the summer of 1944, control of the concentration camps was removed from Pohl&#x27;s WVHA and executive power was instead given over to local HSSPF offices, which, according to Pohl, occurred for operational reasons. Speer&#x27;s armaments ministry took over arms production without the intermediation of the WVHA in the application process for industrial firms seeking business with the Reich. Estimates provided by Pohl indicate that during the second half of 1944, there were upwards of 250,000 slaves working for private firms, another 170,000 working in underground factories and an additional 15,000 clearing rubble from the Allied bombing raids.

== Trial, conviction and execution ==

After the end of World War II in 1945, Pohl first hid in Upper Bavaria, then near Bremen. Disguised as a farmhand, he was arrested by British troops in May 1946 and sentenced to death on 3 November 1947 by an American military tribunal in the eponymous Pohl Trial. Pohl was the chief defendant for the proceedings at the fourth Nuremberg trial; he and his co-conspirators were on trial for crimes committed in the concentration camps administered by the SS-WVHA while he was in charge. Without denying his knowledge of the mass killings of Jews, Pohl presented himself as a mere executive, accusing the prosecution of being guided by feelings of hatred and revenge. Pohl appealed his death sentence several times. During the Nuremberg trials, he started to see a Roman Catholic priest and recommitted himself to the Catholic faith. Officially, Pohl had never left the Catholic Church, although he stopped attending Mass in 1935. In 1950, his re-conversion resulted in the appearance of his book &quot;Credo. Mein Weg zu Gott&quot; (&quot;Credo. My Way to God&quot;), which was published with permission of the Catholic Church. Pohl was hanged shortly after midnight on 7 June 1951 at Landsberg Prison in Landsberg am Lech. Pohl&#x27;s last words were &quot;I have spent more than 30 years as a military man. I have always carried out orders and remained true to my oath of allegiance. I am ready.&quot;

<text>Ivinghoe is a town and civil parish in east Buckinghamshire, England, close to the borders with Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. It is northwest of London, north of Tring and south of Leighton Buzzard, close to the village of Pitstone.

==Etymology==
The town name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Ifa&#x27;s hill-spur&#x27;. The same name is found in Ivington (He) and its strong form in Iveston and Ivesley (Du). The term &quot;hoh&quot; (&#x27;projecting ridge of land, a promontory&#x27; similar to German Höhe) refers probably to Ivinghoe Beacon.
Allen Mawer notes that Ivinghoe is located &quot;at the base of a considerable spur of land jutting out from the main range of the Chilterns&quot;.
In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Evinghehou&quot;.
Other forms: Iuingeho, Hythingho, Yvyngho (xii–xiii cent.); Ivanhoe (xvii cent.)

===Ivinghoe and Ivanhoe===
Ivanhoe is an alternative form of Ivinghoe. It is the inspiration for the title of Walter Scott&#x27;s most famous novel. Ivanhoe is the feudal title of Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In the novel, Richard Coeur de Lion gives Wilfred the investiture of the Lordship of the Manor (Fief) of Ivanhoe. 
Scott took the name from an old rhyme (Tring, Wing and Ivanhoe, For striking of a blow, Hampden did forego, And glad he could escape so ..”).
The form &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is recorded in the Hertfordshire county sessions records for 1665. Until the creation of the Ordnance Survey in the mid 19th century many place names remained uncertain and varied. They often depended on local use and how they might have been written in various documents over time. Prof. Paul Kerswill (a linguistics specialist) writes in a private letter to Dr. Marco Paret (Lord of the Manor of Ivinghoe), that &quot;it is very likely that older, rural people in the Ivinghoe area would have pronounced the name in the same way as Ivanhoe, also dropping the h. Something like &#x27;ivanoe&#x27;. the suffix -ing is pronounced &#x27;in&#x27; in most dialects in the English-speaking world - and has been for many centuries.&quot; 
Sir Walter Scott most likely knew Ivinghoe directly. He stayed at “Stocks&quot; in Berkhamsted for a short time. Berkhamsted is from Ivinghoe.

==Location==
Ivinghoe is situated within the Chiltern Hills, on the edge of the Chilterns&#x27; Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Ivinghoe is an important point on the Icknield Way, joining the Upper Icknield and Lower Icknield together. The Icknield Way is claimed to be the oldest road in Britain, dating back to the Celtic period, though this has been disputed. Today the village is known as a starting point on The Ridgeway, a popular route for hikers and cyclists which uses part of the Icknield Way, running for to Overton Hill in Wiltshire.

Ivinghoe Aston is a hamlet within the parish of Ivinghoe. Its name refers to a farm to the east of the town. The hamlet has four farms, several houses and a public house, &quot;The Village Swan&quot;, which was bought by local residents in 1997.

A small stream called Whistle Brook flows down through the hamlet, from the Chilterns above, to join the River Ouzel at nearby Slapton.

Other hamlets close to Ivinghoe are Ford End and Great Gap.

==Buildings==

The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Ivinghoe dates from 1220 but was set on fire in 1234 in an act of spite against the local Bishop. The church was rebuilt in 1241.

The town has some fine examples of Tudor architecture, particularly around the village green, with 28 buildings marked as listed or significant.

Ivinghoe Beacon, near the town, is an ancient beacon, or signal point, which was used in times of crisis to send messages across the country and is now popular with walkers who just want to get exercise and see the view. It is used as a site for flying model aeroplanes. The hill is the site of an early Iron Age hill fort which, during excavations in the 1960s, was identified from bronzework finds to date back to the Bronze-Iron transition period between 800 and 700 BC. Like many other similar hill forts in the Chilterns it is thought to have been occupied for only a short period, possibly less than one generation.

Nearby is Pitstone Windmill, the oldest windmill in Britain that can be dated, which is owned by the National Trust.

The population of Ivinghoe in 1841 was 740.

==Lords of the Manor==
The manor of Ivinghoe belonged before the Norman Conquest to the demesne of the church of St Peter of Winchester, and at the time of the Domesday Survey it was still held by the bishop, being assessed for 20 hides and valued at £18. It is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as “Evinghehou”.

Succeeding bishops held the manor until the reign of Henry VIII. Lords included William Giffard, Henry of Blois, Godfrey de Luci, John Gervais, Nicholas of Ely, John of Pontoise, John de Stratford, Cardinal Henry Beaufort, William Waynflete, and Richard Foxe. In 1531 William Cholmeley was appointed to be bailiff of Ivinghoe, which had come into the king&#x27;s hands by the forfeiture of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was BoBishop of Winchester. It was, however, restored to the bishopric almost at once to Bishop Stephen Gardiner, and so remained until in 1551, when John Poynet, bishop, surrendered it to the King. In the following month Edward VI made a grant in fee of the manor to Sir John Mason (diplomat), kt., and Elizabeth his wife.

After the death of Edward VI and the flight of Poynet, Ivinghoe, with other episcopal manors, was regranted to the see of Winchester, but was again taken by the Crown at the accession of Elizabeth, the grant to Mason apparently holding good, passing to his son Anthony.

The Egerton Family and Ivinghoe

Anthony Mason held the manor in 1582 and in 1586 alienated the manor to Charles Glenham who sold it in 1589 to Lady Jane Cheyne, widow of Henry Lord Cheyne. In 1603 she conveyed the manor to Ralph Crewe, Thomas Chamberlayn and Richard Cartwright, trustees for the Egertons, and Sir Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley, and Sir John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater, his son and heir, received Ivinghoe from the trustees in 1604.

Lord Ellesmere, who also bore the title of Viscount Brackley, died seised of the manor in 1617. In the same year his son was created Earl of Bridgewater and the manor descended with this title until the latter became extinct in 1829.

By the will of the seventh earl, who died in 1823, the estates were then held by his widow until her death in 1849, when they devolved upon his great-nephew John Egerton, Viscount Alford, father of the second Earl Brownlow, from whom the title and lands descended to the Barons Brownlow. The sixth Baron, notably served as a Lord-in-waiting to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), as Mayor of Grantham, as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook and as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. the titles are held by his son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 1978. Edward John Peregrine Cust (b.1936), CStJ, seventh Baron Brownlow, is the immediate past Lord of the Manor of Ivinghoe. He married Shirlie Edith Yeomans (b.1937), daughter of John Paske Yeomans and Marguerite Watkins, on 31 December 1964. The seventh Baron Brownlow is the last of the direct Egerton line to have hold the Manor of Ivinghoe. Actual Lord of the Manor is Dr. Marco Paret that succeeded to an Egerton descendent. The Lord of the Manor has still the right to hold the customary Courts Baron and Court Leet as permitted by Administration of Justice Act 1977.

==On Film==
Scenes for feature films, such as Quatermass 2, Batman Begins,
Maleficent, The Dirty Dozen, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker as well as the BBC America production Killing Eve, have been shot at Ivinghoe Beacon. Director Raymond Austin filmed the 1960s-1970&#x27;s TV shows The Avengers, The New Avengers and The Saint in and around the village, which once also served as a set for the children&#x27;s TV series ChuckleVision. The opening scene in Wicked, set in Munchkinland, was also shot there. 

== Schools ==
Brookmead School is a mixed, foundation primary school in Ivinghoe. It takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has 340 pupils.

<doc id="413184" wikidata="Q155164" url="?curid=413184" title="Imran Khan">
<text>Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician, philanthropist, and former cricketer who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. He is the founder and former chairman of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Playing until 1992, he was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1983 and International Cricketer of the Year in 1989. Under his captaincy, the team won the 1992 Cricket World Cup, Pakistan&#x27;s only victory in the competition. Considered one of cricket&#x27;s greatest all-rounders, Khan was later inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

Founding Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National Assembly from his hometown of Mianwali in the 2002 general election. PTI became the second-largest party by popular vote in the 2013 election, and five years later, running on a populist platform, PTI formed a coalition government with independents, with Khan as prime minister. Khan&#x27;s government inherited a balance of payments crisis and sought bailouts from the IMF. He presided over GDP growth after initial contraction, implemented austerity policies, and increased tax collection. His government committed to a renewable energy transition, launched the Ehsaas Programme, and the Plant for Pakistan initiative, and expanded the protected areas of Pakistan and Sehat Sahulat Program. The reforms and actions undertaken during his time in office were largely responsible for Pakistan&#x27;s removal from the FATF greylist, though the official exit occurred shortly after his tenure. He presided over the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused economic turmoil and rising inflation in the country. In April 2022, during the constitutional crisis following the Lettergate affair, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana reference case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act in the Lettergate affair, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

== Early life and family ==
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952. Though some sources state he was born on 25 November 1952, Khan has said that this mistake stemmed from that date being written erroneously on his passport. He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters. Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, his paternal family is of Pashtun descent and belongs to the Niazi tribe. One of his ancestors, Haibat Khan Niazi, in the 16th century, &quot;was one of Sher Shah Suri&#x27;s leading generals, as well as being the governor of Punjab.&quot;

Khan&#x27;s maternal family, of the Burki tribe of Pashtuns, has produced a number of cricketers, including those who have represented Pakistan, such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan. Maternally, Khan is also a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal family&#x27;s ancestral town of Kaniguram in South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For about 600 years, Khan&#x27;s maternal family was based in Basti Nau and Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar, Punjab, before migrating to Zaman Park, Lahore, after the Independence of Pakistan in 1947.

A quiet and shy boy in his youth, Khan grew up with his sisters in relatively affluent, upper-middle-class circumstances and received a privileged education. He studied at Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore. In September 1971, Khan arrived at the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England, where he excelled at cricket.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Khan took a part-time job at a store in England to support himself while studying. &quot;During those days, you could only send a certain fixed amount of money abroad. I was studying at Oxford University and my sister was studying at the London School of Economics. So, I told my father to send my sister the money, and I would fend for myself,&quot; he explained. He worked during the Christmas season, washing dishes and cutting cheese. &quot;It was my first and only job,&quot; he said, adding that it ended after ten days due to an argument with someone there.

In 1972, he enrolled in Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975. An enthusiast for college cricket at Keble, Paul Hayes, was instrumental in securing the admission of Khan, after he had been turned down by Cambridge.

During 1980s, Khan got inspired by the writings of the poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, the Iranian writer-sociologist Ali Shariati, and the British diplomat-convert Charles Le Gai Eaton. He found their works intellectually stimulating and influential in deepening his understanding of Islam, particularly its potential for creating a just society and its compatibility with Western identity.

== Personal life ==
Khan had numerous relationships during his bachelor life. He was then known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London&#x27;s nightlife, frequently visiting venues such as Tramp in St James&#x27;s. Many of his girlfriends are unknown and were called &quot;mysterious blondes&quot; by the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and the daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. They first met in 1982 and subsequently visited Pakistan. She accompanied him on various Pakistani cricket team tours, including tours in Peshawar and Australia. She made several artistic portraits of Khan during their relationship. Khan&#x27;s residence in Chelsea, near Sergeant&#x27;s studio and Tramp nightclub, became a central location for his social activities. After long separations, his relationship with Sergeant ended in 1986.

Jonathan Orders, a member of the MCC committee and a Wykehamist, facilitated Khan&#x27;s connections between Eastern and Western social spheres. Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom Khan later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. He also had a brief relationship with Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker. Their relationship lasted for about a year without leading to marriage. Additionally, Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among the women associated with Khan during this period, with their relationships receiving media attention.

Some of the other women with whom he was associated during this period include Zeenat Aman, Sarah Crawley, Stephanie Beacham, Goldie Hawn, Marie Helvin, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. Khan stated that residing in Pakistan was a requirement for a serious relationship.

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White, who later adopted the name Sita, was prepared to convert to Islam. Their relationship ended when White became pregnant. Later, she claimed that Khan was the father of her daughter, Tyrian Jade, born in June 1992. White continued to keep a framed photograph of Khan despite their breakup. Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court declared Khan the father without a DNA test. Khan denied paternity and called for a paternity test in Pakistan, stating that he would accept the decision of the courts of Pakistan. After White&#x27;s death in 2004, Jemima, Khan&#x27;s wife at the time and a friend of Sita, was designated by Sita as the legal guardian of Tyrian in her will. Khan stated that Tyrian would be welcome to join their family in London, leaving the decision entirely up to her, given her established relationship with his and Jemima&#x27;s sons.

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German-born MTV host. Their relationship lasted nearly two years, during which he introduced her to Islam. After their relationship had ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.

On 16 May 1995, Khan married Jemima Goldsmith, in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris. A month later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England. Jemima converted to Islam upon marriage. The couple have two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim. On 22 June 2004, it was announced that the couple had divorced, ending the nine-year marriage because it was &quot;difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan.&quot;

In a 2009 book, Christopher Sandford claimed that Khan and Benazir Bhutto had a close relationship when both were students in Oxford. He wrote that Bhutto at the age of 21 first became close to Khan in 1975. They remained in a relationship for about two months. His mother also tried to have an arranged marriage between them. He further claimed that they had a &quot;romantic relationship&quot;, which was refuted by Khan who said they were only friends.

In January 2015, it was announced that Khan had married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his residence in Islamabad. Reham Khan later states in her autobiography that they in fact got married in October 2014 but the announcement only came in January the year after. On 22 October 2015, they announced their intention to file for divorce.

In mid-2016, late 2017 and early 2018, reports emerged that Khan had married his spiritual mentor (&quot;murshid&quot;), Bushra Bibi. Khan himself, alongside PTI aides, as well as members of the Manika family, denied the rumour. Khan termed the media &quot;unethical&quot; for spreading the rumour, and PTI filed a complaint against the news channels that had aired it. On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat issued a statement that said Khan had proposed to Manika, but she had not yet accepted his proposal. On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan has married Manika. According to Khan, his life has been influenced by Sufism for three decades, and this is what drew him closer to his wife. The Mufti who conducted the marriage later testified to a court that Khan&#x27;s nikah had been conducted twice. The first nikah was conducted on 1 January 2018, while his to-be wife was still in her Iddat, as Khan believed he would become prime minister if he married her on that date.

Khan resided in his sprawling farmhouse at Bani Gala. As of 2018, he owned five pet dogs, who resided in his estate.

== Cricket career ==

=== Early years ===

Khan made his debut at the age of 16 in Lahore. By the start of the 1970s, he was playing for his home teams of Lahore A (1969–1970), Lahore B (1969–1970), Lahore Greens (1970–1971), and eventually Lahore (1970–1971). Khan was part of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Blues Cricket team during the 1973–1975 seasons. Khan played English county cricket from 1971 to 1976 for Worcestershire. During this decade, other teams represented by Khan included Dawood Industries (1975–1976) and Pakistan International Airlines (1975–1976, 1980–1981). From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston. Three years later, in August 1974, he debuted in the One Day International (ODI) match, once again playing against England at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy. After graduating from Oxford and finishing his tenure at Worcestershire, he returned to Pakistan in 1976 and secured a permanent place on his native national team starting from the 1976–1977 season, during which they faced New Zealand and Australia. Following the Australian series, he toured the West Indies, where he met Tony Greig, who signed him up for Kerry Packer&#x27;s World Series Cricket. His credentials as one of the fastest bowlers in the world started to become established when he finished third at 139.7 km/h in a fast bowling contest at Perth in 1978, behind Jeff Thomson and Michael Holding but ahead of Dennis Lillee, Garth Le Roux, and Andy Roberts. During the late 1970s, Khan was one of the pioneers of the reverse swing bowling technique. He imparted this trick to the bowling duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised this art in later years.

As a bowler, Khan initially bowled with a relatively chest-on action, at medium-pace; however, he worked hard to remodel his action to a more classical type, and to strengthen his body, to enable fast bowling. Khan attained his prime as a fast bowler in January 1980 till 1988 when he became out and out fast bowler. During this span Imran picked 236 test wickets at 17.77 apiece with 18 five-wicket hauls and 5 10 wicket hauls. His bowling average and strike rate were better than Richard Hadlee (19.03), Malcolm Marshall (20.20), Dennis Lillee (24.07), Joel Garner (20.62), and Michael Holding (23.68). In January 1983, playing against India, he attained a Test bowling rating of 922 points. Although calculated retrospectively, Khan&#x27;s form and performance during this period ranks third in the ICC&#x27;s All-Time Test Bowling Rankings.

Imran Khan became the first Asian cricketer to be named the International Cricketer of the Year for 1989/90, winning a Rover 827 Vitesse valued at A$72,000. At the time, Australia&#x27;s nationalistic press heavily criticized his selection, prompting Khan to remark in an interview that they made him feel as if winning the car was a crime. The following day, he arrived for the toss with Allan Border wearing a T-shirt that read, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I won the car,&quot; and announced that the proceeds would go to his Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital in Lahore.

Khan achieved the all-rounder&#x27;s triple (securing 3000 runs and 300 wickets) in 75 Tests, the second-fastest record behind Ian Botham&#x27;s 72. He also has the second-highest all-time batting average of 61.86 for a Test batsman playing at position 6 in the batting order. He played his last Test match for Pakistan in January 1992, against Sri Lanka at Faisalabad. Khan retired permanently from cricket six months after his last ODI, the historic 1992 Cricket World Cup Final against England in Melbourne, Australia. He ended his career with 88 Test matches, 126 innings and scored 3807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries and 18 fifties. His highest score was 136. As a bowler, he took 362 wickets in Test cricket, which made him the first Pakistani and world&#x27;s fourth bowler to do so. In ODIs, he played 175 matches and scored 3709 runs at an average of 33.41. His highest score was 102 not out. His best ODI bowling was 6 wickets for 14 runs, a record for the best bowling figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.

=== Captaincy ===
At the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad. As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the remaining 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie.

In the team&#x27;s second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord&#x27;s. Khan&#x27;s first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981–1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three-Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982–1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984–1985 season.

In 1987 in India, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan&#x27;s first series victory in England during the same year. During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 Cricket World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals. Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team.

He holds as a captain the world record for taking most wickets, best bowling strike rate and best bowling average in Test, and best bowling figures (8 wickets for 60 runs) in a Test innings, and also most five-wicket hauls (6) in a Test innings in wins. Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as &quot;the last time I really bowled well.&quot; He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests.

==== 1992 Cricket World Cup final ====
Khan&#x27;s career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal. By the 35th over; Khan brought in Wasim Akram who scored the two most decisive blows to England of the game. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself. The match, viewed by millions, saw Pakistan&#x27;s first and only world cup victory, beating England by 22 runs. Khan&#x27;s leadership of the triumphant Pakistan team in the final gained him publicity for his inspirational role, with the image of Khan raising world cup trophy garnering publicity. After the victory Khan proclaimed,

== Post-retirement from cricket ==

After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering when playing domestic cricket: he &quot;occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam.&quot; Khan defended his actions, arguing his conduct was commonplace at the time. In 1996, Khan successfully defended himself in a lawsuit brought forth by former English captain and all-rounder Ian Botham and batsman Allan Lamb over libellous comments. The case, which the judge labelled a &quot;complete exercise in futility&quot;, ended with a 10–2 majority decision by the jury in favour of Khan.

Khan announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003. Reflecting on his return, Imran remarked, &quot;After Pakistan&#x27;s disappointing performance in the World Cup, a lot of my friends asked me to help Pakistan cricket and despite my commitments in politics I have agreed to help with coaching,&quot; during the launch of regional cricket clinics. He added, &quot;I want to pay back what this country has given me.&quot;
Since retiring, Khan has written opinion pieces on cricket for various British and Asian newspapers, especially regarding the Pakistani national team. His contributions have been published in the Indian magazine &quot;Outlook&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Khan occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Asian and British sports networks, including BBC Urdu and the Star TV network. In 2004, when the Indian cricket team toured Pakistan after 14 years, he was a commentator on TEN Sports&#x27; special live show, &quot;Straight Drive&quot;, while he was also a Sify columnist for the 2005 India-Pakistan Test series. He has provided analysis for every cricket World Cup since 1992, which includes providing match summaries for the BBC during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed as the chancellor of University of Bradford, succeeding Betty Lockwood. On 26 February 2014, University of Bradford Union floated a motion to remove Khan from the post over Khan&#x27;s absence from every graduation ceremony since 2010. Khan announced that he would step down on 30 November 2014, citing his &quot;increasing political commitments.&quot; Brian Cantor, the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor, said Khan had been &quot;a wonderful role model for our students.&quot;

=== Philanthropy ===

During the 1990s, Khan also served as UNICEF&#x27;s Special Representative for Sports and promoted health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. While in London, he also works with the Lord&#x27;s Taverners, a cricket charity. Khan focused his efforts solely on social work. By 1991, he had founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, a charity organisation bearing the name of his mother, Mrs. Shaukat Khanum. As the Trust&#x27;s maiden endeavour, Khan established Pakistan&#x27;s first and then only cancer hospital, constructed using donations and funds exceeding $25 million, raised by Khan from all over the world.

As a result of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Pakistan faced severe flooding. In response, Imran Khan auctioned his signed cricket bat from the 1992 Cricket World Cup and the sweater he wore while playing cricket. The bat alone raised $20,000 for flood victims. Khan stated that these were the last two items he had left, as he had previously auctioned off the rest to support Shaukat Khanum Hospital.

In collaboration with Air Vice Marshal Abdul Razzaq Anjum, also a resident of Mianwali, Khan aspired to establish a cadet college in their hometown. Their vision gained momentum when Governor Khalid Maqbool announced the establishment of the cadet college during a public gathering on 24 January 2002, followed by instructions to prepare a feasibility report. Anjum, wished to return to Mianwali after retirement and aimed to contribute to the district&#x27;s development. In 2003, he was killed in an air crash along with 17 others including Chief of Air Staff Mushaf Ali Mir. The plan was ultimately abandoned and the college was never constructed.

In 2006, Imran Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, announced his vision to establish Namal College, a technical institution in his hometown, stating, &quot;I want to make young people employable by arming them with the skills they will need to get jobs.&quot; Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, the college aimed to tackle unemployment. In 2005, Khan signed an agreement with the University of Bradford, making Namal its associate college. Namal officially opened on 27 April 2008.

The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) established in February 2006, was a welfare organization that supported underprivileged communities in Pakistan, including victims of the 2010 Pakistan floods. On 22 November 2011, the IKF under the umbrella of Akhuwat Foundation, launched a project for disbursing interest-free loans to low-income families in the Nowshera District. In January 2013, IKF announced a Rs30 million emergency relief project for internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees of the war on terror, belonging to the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan who were neglected by the government. The project provided food supplies, winter essentials, and waterproof tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. IKF&#x27;s national program manager, Isfundiar Kasuri, emphasized the urgency of assisting these underserved families despite challenges in the conflict-hit region.

In March 2013, Fiza Farhan, representing the Buksh Foundation, signed an agreement with the IKF to establish solar charging stations in 4,000 off-grid villages of Dera Ghazi Khan, Mianwali, and Dera Ismail Khan in collaboration with Coca-Cola, Zong, and Engro Corporation. The initiative aimed to provide solar lanterns to villagers, offering clean energy and socio-economic benefits, while also supporting female entrepreneurs known as &quot;light ladies&quot; to manage the stations. These efforts helped combat energy poverty, improve living standards, and reduce carbon emissions. As of 15 May 2021, the IKF has ceased operations.

== Early political career ==

=== Initial years ===

Khan was offered political positions more than a few times during his cricketing career. In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a political position in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) which he politely declined. Khan was also invited by Nawaz Sharif to join his political party. In 1993, Khan was appointed as the ambassador for tourism in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi and held the portfolio for three months until the government dissolved. In 1994, Khan joined the Jamiat-e-Pasban, a breakaway faction of Jamaat-e-Islami, led by Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani. However, Khan left the party after becoming uncomfortable with the idea of being seen as a puppet of Gul.

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a potential military coup that could appoint Khan as Prime Minister, responded with marked hostility towards him. The state-run television refused to broadcast archival footage of Imran&#x27;s cricketing heyday and banned fundraising advertisements for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan, a month when Muslims traditionally give to charity. Authorities also spread rumors that Imran was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. As a result, donations to the hospital, which relied entirely on charitable contributions, were cut in half that year.

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded a political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). He ran for the seat of National Assembly of Pakistan in the 1997 Pakistani general election as a candidate of PTI from two constituencies – NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore – but was unsuccessful and lost both the seats to candidates of PML-N.

Khan supported General Musharraf&#x27;s 1999 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état, believing Musharraf would &quot;end corruption, clear out the political mafias.&quot; According to Khan, he was Musharraf&#x27;s choice for prime minister in 2002 but turned down the offer. Khan participated in the October 2002 Pakistani general election that took place across 272 constituencies and was prepared to form a coalition if his party did not get a majority of the vote. He was elected from Mianwali. In the 2002 Pakistani referendum, Khan supported military dictator General Musharraf. He also served as a part of the Standing Committees on Kashmir and Public Accounts.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq began, Khan participated in a protest held in Hyde Park, London opposing the war, alongside Tony Benn. Here, Khan stated: &quot;The fear is that this is not going to be the last war, first it was Afghanistan, now its Iraq and if the hawks in Washington have their way then its going to be some other country very soon.&quot;

On 6 May 2005, Khan was mentioned in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as being the &quot;most directly responsible&quot; for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the &quot;Newsweek&quot; story about the alleged desecration of the Qur&#x27;an in a US military prison at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. In June 2007, Khan faced political opponents in and outside the parliament.

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 other MPs to resign from Parliament in protest of the presidential election scheduled for 6 October, which general Musharraf was contesting without resigning as army chief. On 3 November 2007, Khan was put under house arrest, after president Musharraf declared a state of emergency in Pakistan. Later Khan escaped and went into hiding. He eventually came out of hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab. At the rally, Khan was captured by student activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba and roughly treated. He was arrested during the protest and was sent to the Dera Ghazi Khan jail in the Punjab province where he spent a few days before being released.
On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed more than 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging the policies of the government, and referred to his movement as &quot;not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami.&quot; A successful public gathering of thousands of supporters was held in Karachi on 25 December 2011. According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2012, Khan&#x27;s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) topped the list of popular political parties in Pakistan at the national level, with 31% of the vote. The survey, conducted between February 9 and March 8, 2012, found PTI ahead of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), which received 27%, and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which garnered 16%. The survey also highlighted PTI&#x27;s strong performance, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (49%) and Balochistan (35%), where the party secured the top spot, though it was second in Punjab with 33%.

On 6 October 2012, Khan joined a vehicle caravan of protesters from Islamabad to the village of Kotai in Pakistan&#x27;s South Waziristan region against US drone missile strikes. On 23 March 2013, Khan introduced the &quot;Naya Pakistan Resolution&quot; (New Pakistan) at the start of his election campaign. Between 2011 and 2013, Khan and Nawaz Sharif began to engage each other in a bitter feud. The rivalry between the two leaders grew in late 2011 when Khan addressed his largest crowd at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. From 26 April 2013, in the run up to the elections, both the PML-N and the PTI started to criticise each other. On 29 April, &quot;The Observer&quot; termed Khan and his PTI, as the main opposition to the PML-N.

=== 2013 elections campaign ===
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his final public relations campaign for the 2013 Pakistani general election from Lahore, where he addressed thousands of supporters at the Mall. Khan announced that he would pull Pakistan out of the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt. He addressed different public meetings in various cities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of country, where he announced that PTI will introduce a uniform education system in which the children of rich and poor would have equal opportunities. Khan ended his south Punjab campaign by addressing rallies in various Seraiki belt cities.

The last survey before the elections by &quot;The Herald&quot; showed 24.98 per cent of voters nationally planned to vote for his party, just a whisker behind former prime minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s PML-N. On 7 May, just four days before the elections, Khan was rushed to Shaukat Khanum hospital in Lahore after he tumbled from a forklift at the edge of a stage and fell headfirst to the ground. Khan ended the campaign by addressing a rally of supporters in Islamabad via video link while lying on a bed at a hospital in Lahore.

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May across the country. Nawaz Sharif and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N), secured victory in the elections, though there were allegations of vote-rigging, including claims from Khan and other political figures. Khan&#x27;s party emerged as the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan&#x27;s party became the second-largest party in terms of popular vote nationwide, securing 30 directly elected parliamentary seats, making it the third-largest party in the National Assembly of Pakistan behind the PML (N) and PPP. The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N). While Khan&#x27;s party welcomed the vote, Khan pledged to release a &quot;white paper&quot; on the alleged vote-rigging and vowed to hold protests. He praised the record voter turnout, particularly the participation of youth and women, describing it as a &quot;step forward for democracy.&quot;

While recovering in the hospital, Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to form and lead his party&#x27;s first provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

=== In opposition ===

Khan assumed the role of parliamentary leader of his party in the National Assembly of Pakistan following the 2013 elections. On 31 July 2013, Khan received a contempt of court notice for allegedly criticizing the superior judiciary and referring to it as &quot;shameful.&quot; The notice was discharged after Khan submitted before the Supreme Court that he criticised the lower judiciary for their actions during the May 2013 general election while those judicial officers were working as returning officers. Khan&#x27;s party emerged as the single largest party in the militancy-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and formed the provincial government with the support of coalition partners. Khan was criticised for his support for Sami-ul-Haq, known as the &quot;Father of the Taliban,&quot; and for providing funds to his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.

Khan believed that terrorist activities by the Pakistani Taliban could be stopped through dialogue and even offered them to open an office in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a step towards starting negotiations. He accused the United States of sabotaging peace efforts with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. As a result, he demanded the government to block NATO&#x27;s supply line. On 13 November 2013, Khan ordered Pervez Khattak to dismiss Bakht Baidar and Ibrar Hussan Kamoli of the Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) over corruption allegations and to end the PTI&#x27;s alliance with the party. Baidar, Minister for Manpower and Industry, and Kamoli, Minister for Forest and Environment, were removed, respectively.
A year after the elections, on 11 May 2014, at a rally of his supporters, Khan called for the resignation of all members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the formation of a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who &quot;stole the mandate of the masses.&quot; On 14 August 2014, Imran Khan led a rally of supporters from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s resignation and investigation into alleged electoral fraud. On its way to the capital, Khan&#x27;s vehicle was shot at and his convoy was attacked with stones from PML (N) supporters in Gujranwala. However, there were no fatalities. On 15 August, Khan-led protesters entered the capital and a few days later marched into the high-security Red Zone; on 1 September, according to Al Jazeera, protesters attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s official residence, which prompted the outbreak of violence. Three people died and more than 595 people were injured, including 115 police officers. Prior to the violence that resulted in several deaths, Khan urged his followers to attack police officers after learning that they had initiated a baton charge against his supporters.

By September 2014, Khan had entered into a &quot;de facto&quot; alliance with Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri; both aimed to mobilise their supporters for a regime change campaign against Nawaz Sharif. Following the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan called off his 126-day sit-in in the interest of national unity on 17 December, stating, &quot;The briefing by the Peshawar Corps Commander revealed that external forces were behind this attack and that there were future threats as well.&quot;

Khan entered into an agreement with the Sharif administration in March 2015 to establish a three-member high-powered judicial commission, which would be formed under a presidential ordinance. The commission would make its final report public. If the commission found a country-wide pattern of rigging proved, the prime minister would dissolve the national and provincial assemblies, and fresh elections would be held. the Establishment (the military and other influential institutions), played a behind-the-scenes role in facilitating the talks between PTI and PML-N. General Raheel Sharif, the Chief of Army Staff, was instrumental in encouraging the political parties to unite. The MoU included provisions stating that PTI lawmakers would return to the national and provincial assemblies once the commission was formed and began its investigation into the rigging allegations. The judicial commission&#x27;s findings, published in July 2015, concluded that the 2013 general elections were in large part organized and conducted fairly and in accordance with the law. It found no evidence of a systematic design to manipulate the election results. The commission stated that the elections, on an overall basis, reflected the electorate&#x27;s mandate. Khan accepted the commission&#x27;s findings but expressed reservations over not receiving a copy, stating he would comment further after reading the report. &quot;We have not seen the report yet, if we had, I would have been in a better position to comment on the report. We will comment on the report tomorrow after reading it,&quot; Khan said while addressing a press conference.

In the wake of the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif, which revealed offshore companies linked to the Sharif family. He led protests, filed petitions through his party, and called for Sharif&#x27;s resignation, citing allegations of corruption. Khan&#x27;s party petitioned the Panama Papers case in the Supreme Court to investigate allegations of corruption involving Sharif&#x27;s family. Khan described the case as a &quot;defining moment&quot; for the country.

On 7 April 2017, Khan criticised Pakistan&#x27;s decision to support the Afghan jihad in the 1980s. Khan stated, &quot;We made a big mistake in the 80s by entering into the jihad against the soviets. That left Pakistan with militants, militant groups, we had Kalashnikovs flooded and we had drugs which could be used to finance the war.&quot; Khan further added that prior to joining the war, Pakistan never had sectarian militant groups, &quot;Fast forward to another decade later 9/11 happens and we are hunting the same jihadi groups which became terrorists.&quot; Khan remarked that Pakistan took dollars to prepare militants and then later took dollars to fight against them. Khan also expressed his views regarding US president Donald Trump stating &quot;When Trump got elected and then I saw his team...I thought to myself he is not as bad as I thought he was, he is much worse.&quot;

== 2018 elections campaign ==
Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu), NA-53 (Islamabad-II), NA-95 (Mianwali-I), NA-131 (Lahore-IX), and NA-243 (Karachi East-II). According to early, official results, Khan led the poll, although his opposition, mainly PML-N, alleged large-scale vote rigging and administrative malpractices. On 27 July, election officials declared that Khan&#x27;s party had won 110 of the 269 seats, giving PTI a plurality in the National Assembly. At the conclusion of the count on 28 July, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced that the PTI had won a total of 116 of the 270 seats contested. Khan became the first person in the history of Pakistan elections who contested and won in all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who contested in four but won in three constituencies in 1970.

In May 2018, Khan&#x27;s party announced a 100-day agenda for a possible future government. The agenda included sweeping reforms in almost all areas of government including creation of a new province in Southern Punjab, fast tracking of merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, betterment of law and order situation in Karachi, and betterment of relations with Baloch political leaders.

A number of opposition parties alleged &quot;massive rigging&quot; in Khan&#x27;s favour amid allegations of military interference in the general elections. Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N party, in particular, claimed that a conspiracy between the judiciary and military had influenced the election in favour of Khan and PTI. The Election Commission rejected allegations of rigging, and Sharif and his PML-N later conceded victory to Khan, despite lingering &#x27;reservations&#x27; regarding the result. Two days after the 2018 general elections were held, the chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, Michael Gahler, confirmed that the overall situation of the general election was satisfactory.

During his victory speech, he laid out the policy outlines for his future government. Khan said his inspiration is to build Pakistan as a humanitarian state based on principles of the first Islamic state of Medina. He described that his future government will put the poor and commoners of the country first and all policies will be geared towards elevating the standards of living of the lesser fortunate. He promised an investigation into rigging allegations. He said that he wanted a united Pakistan and would refrain from victimising his political opponents. Everyone would be equal under the law. He promised a simple and less costly government, devoid of showy pompousness in which the prime minister&#x27;s house will be converted into an educational institute and governor houses will be used for public benefit. On foreign policy, he praised China and hoped to have better relations with Afghanistan, United States, and India. On the Middle East, he said his government will strive to have a balanced relationship with Saudi Arabia and Iran.

=== Nominations and appointments ===
On 6 August 2018, his party officially nominated him as the candidate for prime minister. Delivering a speech during his nomination, Khan said that he would present himself for public accountability for an hour every week in which he will answer questions. After the election, Khan made several appointments and nominations for national and provincial level public office holders. Asad Umar was designated as finance minister. Khan nominated Imran Ismail for Governor of Sindh, Mahmood Khan as Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chaudhry Sarwar as Governor of Punjab, Asad Qaiser as Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, and Shah Farman as Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In Balochistan, his party decided to support the Balochistan Awami Party which nominated Jam Kamal Khan for chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.

Khan&#x27;s party nominated Pakistan Muslim League (Q) leader and former Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan Pervaiz Elahi for the slot of Speaker of the Punjab Assembly. Abdul Razak Dawood was nominated to be the advisor to prime minister on economic affairs. Qasim Khan Suri was nominated for deputy speaker of national assembly slot. Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani and Mehmood Jan were nominated as speaker and deputy speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly respectively. Dost Muhammad Mazari was nominated as Deputy Speaker for the Provincial Assembly of Punjab. Khan nominated Sardar Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab. Announcing the nomination, Khan said that he chose Buzdar because he belongs to the most backward area of Punjab. According to sources within PTI, Buzdar was nominated as a makeshift arrangement because it would be easier to remove a lesser-known individual when Shah Mahmood Qureshi was ready to become chief minister. Some within PTI suggested that he was chosen because other potential candidates like Dareshaks, Khosas, and Hashim Jawan Bakht declined the offer to take on a temporary role.

== Prime Minister (2018–2022) ==

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election. His inauguration speech emphasised governance based on the principles of the Islamic state of Medina. Early bureaucratic reshuffles saw the appointment of Sohail Mahmood as Foreign Secretary, Rizwan Ahmed as Maritime Secretary, and Naveed Kamran Baloch as Finance Secretary. His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence. Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Khan faced criticism for resisting a nationwide lockdown. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), condemned Khan&#x27;s decision, stating that the federal government&#x27;s mixed signals weakened initial lockdown efforts, and that doctors in cities like Lahore and Karachi protested the lack of support, especially in testing capabilities. The ambiguity of the federal policy led to inconsistent enforcement across the country, exacerbated by religious clerics pressuring the government to keep mosques open during Ramadan, contributing to widespread violations of safety guidelines. The military&#x27;s growing involvement in managing the crisis also raised concerns about governance and Khan&#x27;s control.

In March 2020, Ayesha Siddiqa wrote that Khan appeared confused and indecisive in his handling of the pandemic. Siddiqa wrote that, Khan struggled with coordinating his response, and military figures took charge of key decisions. According to Siddiqa, this highlighted the civilian government&#x27;s lack of authority and underscored the increasing role of the Pakistan military in governance. Khan&#x27;s reluctance to implement a full lockdown reflected his concern for the economy, with the prime minister stating that a nationwide lockdown would exacerbate poverty, particularly in a country where 25% of the population lived in severe poverty. In April 2020, Khan&#x27;s government rolled out the largest welfare programme in Pakistan&#x27;s history, worth nearly $1 billion, to support the country&#x27;s poorest populations. This effort targeted daily wage earners, who had been hit hardest by the pandemic.

In June 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s response was criticised for the lack of a full lockdown and ongoing public health challenges, including overwhelmed hospitals. The World Health Organization warned of the rapidly escalating cases and urged more stringent measures, which the government rejected, prioritizing economic recovery. Khan&#x27;s government opted for a &quot;smart lockdown&quot; strategy, targeting COVID-19 hotspots while minimizing economic disruption, with military technology being used to track and trace virus cases. In June 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s healthcare system was struggling under the weight of the pandemic, and the country entered its first recession in years, leading to a significant rise in poverty.

COVID-19 cases decreased in June 2020 and Pakistan&#x27;s government emphasized the success of &quot;smart lockdowns&quot; in containing the virus. Health experts warned of a potential surge. The World Health Organization praised the use of Pakistan&#x27;s Polio infrastructure to combat the virus, but concerns persisted regarding SOP adherence. Economic recovery followed, with signs of improvement in business confidence and a surplus in the current account. However, exports declined by 17% YoY in July-August. The textile sector saw recovery with high export orders, while the government focused on offering utility concessions and addressing the shortfall of 700 million meters of cloth. The Asian Development Bank identified economic recovery in manufacturing and construction by December 2020. Despite export growth, food insecurity, inflation, and poor internet infrastructure continued to be significant challenges. In a 2021 Gallup Pakistan survey, 73% of Pakistanis expressed satisfaction with the government&#x27;s pandemic response. Exports grew by 9% in February 2021, but the trade deficit widened. The government&#x27;s response to the cotton shortfall included allowing duty-free imports of cotton yarn. Fitch Ratings predicted a fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio, but noted the country&#x27;s public finance challenges. Tax relief for industries such as textiles and pharmaceuticals created a revenue shortfall, placing pressure on fiscal targets. In July 2021, The Economist ranked Pakistan third for pandemic normalcy with a score of 84.4, but a rise in daily COVID-19 cases followed.

===Foreign policy===

In November 2018, after President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of failing to aid the U.S. in the War on Terror, Khan responded by highlighting Pakistan&#x27;s losses and contributions, asserting that the country was &quot;not your hired gun anymore.&quot;

Following the 2019 Pulwama attack, India accused Pakistan of involvement, prompting Khan to authorize a military response if attacked. This culminated in the 2019 Balakot airstrike by India, which Pakistan countered with Operation Swift Retort, leading to the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, whom Khan later released as a peace gesture. Khan refused to engage with India after the Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 and twice denying Narendra Modi the use of Pakistani airspace.

In September 2019, Khan stated that Trump had asked him to facilitate U.S.-Iran talks, though Trump later denied any formal mediation had been agreed upon. He later visited both Iran and Saudi Arabia to ease tensions between the two nations, though Saudi officials clarified that no mediation had been requested.

Khan also expressed support for Turkey during the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria. He also championed the Afghan peace process and facilitated trade by inaugurating a 24/7 border crossing with Afghanistan. On Israel, he reiterated that Pakistan would not recognize it until a Palestinian state was established, aligning with the stance of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

In 2019, he was named in the &quot;Time 100&quot; list of the world&#x27;s most influential people.

His government also improved relations with Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with Pakistan securing debt relief and diplomatic engagement. His visit to Saudi Arabia was seen as an effort to restore relations strained by Pakistan&#x27;s refusal to support the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war.

In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, seeking to strengthen economic ties and address Pakistan&#x27;s energy needs. His visit coincided with the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prompting international criticism, including from the United States, which urged responsible nations to oppose Vladimir Putin&#x27;s actions. Discussions with Putin focused on &quot;economic and energy cooperation,&quot; including the development of the Pakistan Stream gas pipeline.

Despite the geopolitical tensions, Khan maintained that the visit was pre-planned and aimed at fostering neutrality in global alliances. During a subsequent UN General Assembly emergency session, Pakistan abstained from condemning Russia, with Khan advocating for de-escalation and adherence to international law. He later criticised Western envoys who urged Pakistan to support the UN resolution against Russia. After his government&#x27;s ouster, Khan claimed that the visit had secured offers for discounted oil and wheat from Russia, although this was denied by the Russian Ambassador to Pakistan, who stated that no formal agreements had been signed. The ambassador further suggested that the visit may have contributed to Khan&#x27;s removal from power.

===Economic policy===

Khan&#x27;s government faced significant economic challenges after taking office in 2018, inheriting a twin balance of payments and debt crisis. His administration sought to stabilize the economy through a mix of austerity measures, structural reforms, and a $6 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These measures, which included devaluing the rupee, slashing subsidies, and targeting ambitious tax revenue goals, led to criticism from those who believed they contradicted Khan&#x27;s promises of establishing an Islamic welfare state. Among the unpopular reforms were increased gas and electricity tariffs, straining citizens&#x27; daily lives. Despite these challenges, Khan&#x27;s policies achieved some economic progress. In its 2020 report, the World Bank&#x27;s Ease of doing business index noted that Pakistan&#x27;s business environment improved significantly, moving from 136th to 108th in global rankings, driven by six key regulatory reforms. Additionally, Pakistan recorded a 17% increase in tax revenue for the first seven months of the fiscal year 2019.

The government also saw a record-high remittance inflow of $23.1 billion in FY2019-2020, helping to cushion the economy despite broader challenges such as negative GDP growth. Fiscal measures and a significant increase in non-tax revenue helped reduce the fiscal deficit to 0.9% of GDP by the beginning of FY21. However, persistent inflation, stagnant exports, and limited resource mobilization continued to undermine economic growth, with exports contracting by 16.6% in mid-2020. While tax collection showed improvement, Khan&#x27;s government faced significant economic setbacks, including high inflation and a weakening currency, leading to political criticism. Moreover, the country&#x27;s debt continued to rise due to high borrowing from previous administrations and the need to borrow an additional $24 billion to repay past loans. In parallel, economic reforms such as the second phase of the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (FTA-II) were implemented to boost exports.

By the end of 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s current account had shifted to surplus for the first time in years, largely due to increased remittances, though experts cautioned that the gains were temporary and linked to pandemic-related factors. Additionally, Khan&#x27;s government made significant strides in the IT sector, with exports rising by 47.4% in FY2020-21. Despite these advancements, Pakistan&#x27;s economic difficulties persisted under Khan&#x27;s leadership, with the nation grappling with high inflation, energy price hikes, and a volatile currency, all contributing to political and public dissatisfaction.

===Social policy===
Khan&#x27;s government supported the restoration and construction of religious sites for minorities. In Quetta, a 200-year-old Gurdwara, previously used as a school for Muslim girls, was returned to the Sikh community after a prolonged legal battle, allowing worship for the first time in 73 years. His government also supported the construction and renovation of Sikh shrines, including the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Khan formally inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor on 9 November 2019, providing visa-free access for Indian Sikh pilgrims. While the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) fully supported this initiative, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) criticised it, citing India&#x27;s negative responses and tensions over Kashmir.

Khan&#x27;s government introduced the Single National Curriculum (SNC) to standardise the education system, initially targeting classes 1 to 5. The Sehat Sahulat Program was launched to provide free medical care, with over 7 million families in Punjab reportedly receiving coverage. The government also launched the Ehsaas Programme as a comprehensive social safety net. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme reportedly disbursed Rs. 175 billion to 14.6 million beneficiaries. The programme received praise from Michael Barber, who described it as a transparent, results-driven poverty alleviation model.

Khan proposed measures regarding sexual violence, including the public hanging and chemical castration of convicted rapists. However, following objections from the Council of Islamic Ideology deeming chemical castration un-Islamic, the punishment was removed.

===Accountability===
Khan&#x27;s government launched an anti-corruption campaign aimed at addressing elite political corruption. However, the campaign faced criticism for stalling projects, allegedly targeting political opponents, and being used for political victimization, as raised by the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party and international organizations like Human Rights Watch.

Khan&#x27;s relationship with billionaire sugar baron Jahangir Tareen soured amid the 2020 sugar scandal, when Khan pushed for an investigation into the matter. The inquiry found that Tareen&#x27;s company, JWD, received a substantial share of export subsidies between 2015 and 2018, which were linked to the rise in sugar prices. The rift between the two deepened, eventually leading to Tareen&#x27;s self-imposed exile in London.

Despite claims of significant financial recoveries of Rs487 billion by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Pakistan&#x27;s ranking on the Corruption Perceptions Index worsened from 117th in 2018 to 140th in 2021, leading to criticism of the effectiveness of Khan&#x27;s anti-corruption measures. The Assets Recovery Unit (ARU), established by Khan, facilitated recoveries of Rs426.4 billion in collaboration with agencies like NAB, the Federal Investigation Agency, and the Federal Board of Revenue. However, the ARU itself did not directly recover assets. The ARU faced criticism throughout Khan&#x27;s tenure from the then-opposition, which demanded an audit of the unit.

===Environment and energy===

His government reported record hydropower generation by WAPDA in 2019–2020, marking a 20% increase from the previous year. Key hydropower projects, including Dasu Dam, Mohmand Dam, and Diamer-Bhasha Dam, were initiated, alongside the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW) signed in June 2020. His government pledged to avoid new coal-fired power stations, aiming instead for a renewable energy target of 60% by 2030. The cancellation of two planned coal projects was part of this shift. Efforts towards climate change mitigation included the launch of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami Programme, aiming to plant 10 billion trees across Pakistan. The government reported that approximately 1.5 million trees were planted on the programme&#x27;s first day. However, a special audit revealed over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities, including fake reporting and unverified plantation claims.

===FATF compliance===
In June 2018, before Khan became Prime Minister, Pakistan was placed on the FATF grey list due to deficiencies in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. His government introduced the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill 2020 in Parliament. The opposition objected to specific provisions, including those granting authorities the power to arrest without a warrant and conduct covert operations. They described these as &quot;draconian laws&quot; that violated fundamental rights and claimed they exceeded FATF requirements. Khan criticized the opposition for blocking the bills, accusing them of seeking an NRO. By June 2021, 26 out of 27 points were addressed and FATF urged swift action to complete the final item.

In June 2022, two months following Khan&#x27;s ouster, FATF decided to remove Pakistan from the grey list, recognizing the completion of both the 2018 and 2021 action plans. Khan credited his government for the achievement, particularly his former energy minister, Hammad Azhar, who led the FATF Coordination Committee. The Shehbaz Sharif government also claimed credit for the success, while &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; acknowledged that Khan&#x27;s government had &quot;done most of the work.&quot; Pakistan was officially removed from the grey list in October 2022 after a successful FATF on-site visit.

===Security and terrorism===
During Khan&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister of Pakistan, there was progress in improving security, as evidenced by a 13% reduction in terrorist attacks in 2019 compared to the previous year, although challenges remained in regions such as Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and concerns about terrorism financing persisted. In 2019, his government formally banned the Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa and its affiliate Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation under the Anti-Terrorism Act, and arrested Saeed. The following year, foreign investors expressed greater confidence in Pakistan&#x27;s improving security situation. Khan attracted international criticism in 2020 after calling Osama bin Laden a &quot;martyr&quot; and refusing to label him a terrorist.

===Austerity policy===
Khan also implemented austerity measures to reduce government spending, such as reducing the Prime Minister&#x27;s staff from 524 to just two and auctioning luxury items like bulletproof vehicles and helicopters. While some of these efforts faced criticism, particularly his use of a helicopter despite promoting austerity, a 2021 report highlighted significant savings, including a 49% reduction in the Prime Minister&#x27;s House expenses and a 29% decrease in spending on the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

===Press freedom===
Khan&#x27;s government faced criticism for suppressing dissent. The Human Rights Watch noted increased restrictions on media and civil society. Journalists were subjected to legal actions, raids, and physical threats, with Khan reportedly referring to them as &quot;mafias&quot; and &quot;blackmailers.&quot; International organizations like Reporters Without Borders condemned investigations into journalists and proposals to centralise media regulation.

===Locust infestation===

Khan&#x27;s government also responded to a severe locust infestation between 2019 and 2020, declaring a national emergency and implementing measures like aerial spraying. Despite initial delays, Pakistan managed to bring the crisis under control by October 2020, with the Food and Agriculture Organization commending the country&#x27;s efforts as exemplary.

===Stance regarding Islamophobia===
In October 2020, Khan called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to ban Islamophobic content, comparing it to the platform&#x27;s ban on Holocaust denial. He criticised French President Emmanuel Macron for supporting cartoons of Prophet Muhammad, amid protests in Pakistan. In March 2022, Khan&#x27;s government led a resolution at the United Nations, resulting in the adoption of March 15 as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.

===Public sector===
Public sector reforms included Pakistan International Airlines achieving operational breakeven after &quot;quite a long time&quot; and golden handshake schemes for employees at Pakistan Steel Mills.

===Removal from office===
In early 2022, a leaked Pakistani diplomatic cipher revealed that during a meeting on 7 March 2022, US State Department officials, including Donald Lu, expressed concerns over Khan&#x27;s stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to the leaked cipher, the US warned of potential economic and political consequences for Pakistan if Khan remained in office, though the US denied attempting to remove him and instead framed the issues as related to his policies, not internal politics.

On 8 March 2022, opposition parties submitted a no-confidence motion against Khan, citing his government&#x27;s mismanagement of the economy and rising inflation. Despite the opposition&#x27;s claims of majority support, Khan remained confident of defeating the motion. However, by 18 March, key members of his party defected, and two coalition partners joined the opposition, resulting in the loss of Khan&#x27;s majority in the National Assembly.

On 27 March, Khan presented a letter alleging foreign interference in Pakistan&#x27;s politics, suggesting US involvement in his potential removal. The National Security Council (NSC) also expressed concerns about foreign interference. On 3 April, following the Deputy Speaker&#x27;s rejection of the no-confidence motion, President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly, leading to legal challenges by the opposition. Khan&#x27;s claims of foreign interference were echoed by Russian officials, including Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who criticized the US for its alleged attempts to punish Khan over his independent foreign policy, particularly his relations with Russia. On 10 April, Khan sent the cipher to the Supreme Court, despite warnings from legal advisors about the potential violation of constitutional oaths and the Official Secrets Act.

Khan was ultimately ousted after a Supreme Court ruling on 10 April that deemed the rejection of the no-confidence motion illegal, with the vote passing in favor of his removal, making him the first Pakistani PM to be ousted by a no-confidence vote. Following his removal, Khan continued to allege US involvement in his ouster, blaming the US for opposing his independent foreign policy, which fostered closer ties with China and Russia. Subsequently, the new government held another National Security Council meeting, rejecting the claim that Khan&#x27;s government was removed through a foreign conspiracy. However, they quietly agreed with the earlier meeting, chaired by Khan&#x27;s government, that the U.S. had interfered in Pakistan&#x27;s internal affairs.

== Post-premiership ==
=== 2022 Toshakhana reference case ===

The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) filed the Toshakhana case against Imran Khan in August 2022, alleging he failed to disclose details of 108 official gifts received during his premiership and the proceeds from their sale in his annual report to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

Of these, Khan reportedly retained 58 gifts, with only 14 valued above Rs. 14,000 each. On 8 September, Khan rejected the allegations as misleading and false, requesting the ECP to dismiss the case. In a 60-page reply through his counsel, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, Khan disclosed that 329 official gifts were received during his government&#x27;s tenure, with 58 attributed to him and his wife. He maintained that all purchases were lawfully declared in his tax returns and wealth statements. The ECP launched an investigation and conducted hearings, with delays as Khan&#x27;s legal team sought extensions.

On 21 October 2022, the commission ruled to disqualify Khan from holding public office, citing false statements and inaccurate declarations of assets for the tax year 2020–21. A five-member ECP bench, led by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, heard the case. The defense argued that the ECP lacked jurisdiction under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, which reserves authority for superior courts. The CEC advised the defense to file a separate petition on this matter.

===Assassination attempt===
On 3 November 2022, Khan was shot in the leg in an assassination attempt in Wazirabad while leading a march to Islamabad to demand early elections. Footage aired on local news channels captured the sound of automatic gunfire and showed Khan being carried away and placed in a vehicle. He was rushed to a hospital in Lahore, where doctors stated that he was in stable condition. One of his supporters, Moazzam Gondal, was killed during the attack, and 10 others were also wounded. The alleged perpetrator, identified as Muhammad Naveed, was overpowered by one of Khan&#x27;s supporters, thus throwing off his aim, and was arrested at the scene. In a video released by the police, Naveed stated that he acted alone and targeted Imran Khan because he felt the former prime minister was misleading the people. Khan blamed the incumbent government for the assassination plot, primarily prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior minister Rana Sanaullah and the Director General Counter Intelligence of the Inter-Services Intelligence Faisal Naseer, although he did not present any evidence to substantiate these claims. In response to these accusations, both government and military officials strongly denied any involvement in the attack. Federal Information Minister Maryam Aurangzeb refuted Khan&#x27;s charges, questioning how he could demand the resignation of these officials before an investigation had even begun. Additionally, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of Pakistan&#x27;s military, condemned the allegations, labeling them baseless and irresponsible, and warned that no one would be allowed to defame the military or its personnel. Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah also rejected Khan&#x27;s accusations, calling them grievous.
====Second alleged attempt====
Khan alleged that a trap was set at the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC) on 18 March 2023, where he arrived for a Toshakhana case hearing. He said that his colleague signaled him to escape, understanding the situation to be a trap. In an audio message sent to journalists, Khan stated that he had been &quot;waiting outside the [judicial complex&#x27;s] door&quot; and had been &quot;fully trying to enter,&quot; but the police&#x27;s use of tear gas made it seem that &quot;they don&#x27;t want&quot; him to reach court. Meanwhile, the Islamabad police tweeted that upon Khan&#x27;s arrival at the judicial complex, his supporters began pelting the police with stones, prompting them to respond with tear gas. Khan claimed that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had taken control of the area around the Judicial Complex the night before the attack in Islamabad. He further stated that the ISI was responsible for his conditions in jail and suggested that they were involved in attempts to make his imprisonment harsher. Despite waiting five hours, he did not disembark from his vehicle. Khan said men in plain shalwar kameez were present. He further claimed that the purpose of &quot;approximately 20&quot; men was another attempt on his life, similar to the Wazirabad attack.

Khan also accused police, the Pakistan Rangers, and unidentified individuals of provoking his supporters to create chaos in order to use it as a cover to kill him. He condemned a police raid on his home in his absence, calling it unlawful and a violation of court orders, and added that the plan was orchestrated on the instructions of Maryam Nawaz.

=== Arrests and imprisonment ===

As a result of an arrest warrant issued by the district and sessions court in Islamabad, the Islamabad Police and Lahore Police started an operation to arrest Khan on 14 March 2023. On 9 May, Khan was arrested at the Islamabad High Court by paramilitary forces who stormed into the courthouse; this was over his alleged role in the 190 million pound case. The case involves allegations of corruption and abuse of authority by Khan. The case centres on a settlement made during Khan&#x27;s tenure between his administration and property tycoon Malik Riaz, which allegedly caused a £190 million loss to the national exchequer. The funds, originally seized by the UK&#x27;s National Crime Agency, were returned to Pakistan but were reportedly redirected for other purposes. Khan and his associates, including his wife Bushra Bibi, are accused of misusing their positions to secure land for the Al-Qadir Trust in exchange for legal protection for Riaz. His arrest led to widespread protests and the May 9 riots. The arrest was later declared illegal by the Supreme Court. Following the 9 May riots, many PTI members deserted Khan and founded the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party under the leadership of Jahangir Tareen. On 12 May, the Islamabad High Court declared the arrest illegal and mandated Khan&#x27;s immediate release. Khan was granted protected bail and released on the same day, meaning he could not be re-arrested on those charges for two weeks.

On 5 August 2023, Khan was arrested for the second time and sentenced to three years in prison after being found guilty of misusing his premiership from 2018 to 2022 to buy and sell gifts in state possession that were received during visits abroad and worth more than 140 million rupees. On 29 August 2023, an appeals court suspended Khan&#x27;s corruption conviction and three-year prison term, and granted bail. Despite the suspended conviction in the corruption case, a special court in Islamabad ordered that he remain incarcerated in connection with the &quot;cypher case&quot;: Khan has repeatedly alleged that he received a cypher, or diplomatic cable, which contained proof that there was a US led conspiracy with Pakistan&#x27;s military establishment to oust him from office. The Federal Investigation Agency registered a case against Khan for sharing information on the alleged cypher and leaking state secrets, and thereby violating the Official Secrets Act.

In August 2023, the government submitted a report to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, stating that Khan&#x27;s daily meals included bread, omelette, curd, and tea for breakfast, along with fresh fruits, vegetables, pulses, rice, and desi mutton cooked in ghee for lunch and dinner. His cell was cleaned daily by a designated sanitary worker, and additional security personnel were deployed for his safety. The Supreme Court had ordered the government to submit this report following Khan&#x27;s complaints about the conditions in which he was being held.

On 30 January 2024, Khan was convicted and sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment over the case. Khan reacted by urging voters to &quot;take revenge for every injustice with your vote&quot; in the 2024 Pakistani general election on 8 February. One of his lawyers called the decision illegal, and his legal team planned to appeal the decision. Many observers alleged that the sentence was part of a campaign to sideline Khan and the PTI before the 2024 elections; Khan himself described all the charges against him as &quot;politically motivated.&quot; Khan&#x27;s former foreign minister and deputy in the PTI, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, was also sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment over the case. Khan&#x27;s sister Aleema said that prosecutors had sought the death penalty for her brother. The next day, Khan was convicted and sentenced to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment for the Toshakhana case, which involved the illegal sale of state gifts given to him and his wife, Bushra Bibi, when he was prime minister. The sentence was suspended on 1 April pending an appeal. On 3 February, Khan and his wife were convicted and sentenced to an additional seven years in prison and fined 500,000 rupees ($1,800) each following a criminal complaint by Bushra Bibi&#x27;s former husband, Khawar Maneka, saying that Bushra did not complete her Iddat before marrying Khan in 2018. On 16 February, his legal team filed an appeal against the three consecutive convictions.

Since his arrest in August, Khan has been held in the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where his trial was also held. On 8 February, a PTI official said Khan had been allowed to vote in prison for the 2024 Pakistani general election using a postal ballot. On 12 March 2024, the Government of Punjab imposed a two-week ban on visits to the prison.

On 30 May 2024, told the Supreme Court that he was living in solitary confinement and the government had put restrictions on his meeting with lawyers and family members. The Pakistani government told the Supreme Court in June that the conditions of Khan&#x27;s imprisonment included a walking area adjacent to his cell, a cooler, a television, and exercise equipment. It said that Khan has access to a separate kitchen and could meet with his legal team and family. In its submission, the government provided photographs of Khan&#x27;s cell and other items and a photo of a meeting between him and his legal team in prison.

On 3 June 2024, the Islamabad High Court overturned Khan&#x27;s conviction on the cypher case. Khan remained in prison due to his conviction for a breach of the marriage laws. On 13 July, Khan&#x27;s conviction in the marriage case with Bushra Bibi was overturned following an appeal. Khan remained in prison and was then arrested on charges related to the 2023 riots. Since the 2022 no-confidence vote, Khan has been involved in over 180 court cases.

In June 2024, a United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called for Khan&#x27;s release, arguing that his detention was arbitrary and politically motivated. Khan was sentenced on corruption charges in 2023. Amnesty International raised similar concerns, particularly over the conditions of his imprisonment. In an interview with The Sunday Times in July from prison, Khan said he is being held in a small, &#x27;death cell&#x27; typically reserved for terrorists. Khan&#x27;s legal team and his sister, Aleema Khan, said that the authorities are endangering his health and attempting to weaken him by keeping him in poor conditions, while Aleema also stated that Khan was suffering from an eye infection. A regular medical examination is performed every two weeks, and no health issues have been reported during his imprisonment by authorities.

On 8 October 2024, an attempted murder charge was filed against him over the death of a police officer during protests by Khan&#x27;s supporters in Islamabad.

On 22 November 2024, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted Khan bail in the Toshakhana case, but he was not released from jail due to multiple other cases against him. On 24 November 2024, his supporters marched nationwide, demanding his release.

The Ministry of Interior, Islamabad Police, Federal Investigation Agency, and National Accountability Bureau reported to court that 186 cases were filed against Khan across Pakistan as of 6 December 2024.

On 17 January 2025, Khan was sentenced to 14 years in prison by an accountability court in the Al-Qadir Trust case, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year jail term. The case revolves around allegations that Khan and his wife secured land worth billions of rupees from property tycoon Malik Riaz in exchange for a deal that cost the national exchequer Rs 50 billion. The funds, originally recovered by the UK&#x27;s National Crime Agency, were allegedly diverted to pay fines imposed on Riaz rather than being deposited into Pakistan&#x27;s treasury. The couple, who are the sole trustees of the Al-Qadir Trust, are accused of misusing funds and acquiring 458 kanals of land for a university established under the trust.

In February 2025, after a meeting with Imran Khan in prison, his sister Aleema Khan said, &quot;[t]here is no truth in the reports [doing the rounds in the media] claiming that the PTI founder is ill,&quot; when questioned about Khan&#x27;s health and added that Bushra Bibi was being kept in solitary confinement.

====Views regarding imprisonment====
During Khan&#x27;s imprisonment, he has retained a presence in Pakistani politics, with reports suggesting a rise in his popularity, particularly among the youth. There have been a lack of public demonstrations in his favour since his arrest due to media outlets under instructions not to cover PTI&#x27;s activities, police actions against Khan&#x27;s supporters making them fearful of arrest, and a reduction in the number of PTI members. The BBC reported that &quot;silent support&quot; for Khan was still strong. Khan has said that his imprisonment has political motivations, alleging involvement by the Pakistan Armed Forces (referred to as The Establishment) and the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Both the military and the government have denied these allegations, with the military labelling them as &#x27;fabricated and malicious,&#x27; and Prime Minister Sharif rejecting them as &#x27;blatant lies.&#x27; While he was brought before the Supreme Court by the jail authorities, Khan alleged that Pakistan is under what he describes as an &quot;undeclared martial law.&quot; He argues that his detention is part of a broader attempt to suppress democratic forces and weaken opposition. He also stated that he deeply regretted trusting General Bajwa and implicated him in causing the country&#x27;s turmoil.

=== University of Oxford Chancellor candidacy ===

Despite his imprisonment, Khan remains politically active, having applied to run in the 2024 University of Oxford Chancellor Election. His candidacy has gained attention, with supporters promoting the campaign on social media.

Khan&#x27;s candidacy also attracted some concerns due to timing, coinciding with ongoing political unrest in Pakistan and his imprisonment on multiple charges, including corruption and sedition at the time. His supporters argue these charges are politically motivated, critics suggested that his legal battles and the broader political context might distract from his ability to focus on the responsibilities of the role. Some observers saw his candidacy as a way to draw international attention to his political situation and about whether his motivations are primarily political rather than academic.

On 16 October 2024, university officials excluded him from the race of chancellorship stating that his candidacy was disqualified based on established exclusion criteria, which led to the acceptance of 38 out of over 40 applicants. Key factors cited include Khan&#x27;s prior conviction and his active political role, which were seen as inconsistent with the requirements for the position. Legal analysis from King&#x27;s Counsel Hugh Southey of Matrix Chambers, as well as policy advocacy group Beltway Grid, said that Oxford&#x27;s regulations set standards of integrity and impartiality that Khan did not meet.

Khan&#x27;s sister, Rubina Khanum, claimed that Zulfi Bukhari &quot;had dragged Imran Khan into the chancellor candidacy race for self-interest,&quot; further saying &quot;Imran Khan is in jail; what interest does he have in becoming Oxford University&#x27;s chancellor?&quot;

== Wealth ==
In 2003, Khan had a house in Zaman Park, Lahore worth . He was also an investor, investing more than in various businesses. He was owner of agriculture land of 39 kanals (5 acres) at Talhar, Islamabad, and 530 kanals (66 acres) at Khanewal and had a share in 363 kanals (44 acres) of other agricultural land that he had inherited. Khan paid to buy two apartments at Shahra-e-Dastoor in Islamabad. Other assets in 2017 included furniture worth and livestock valued at . He then had no vehicle registered in his name.

In 2017, Khan owned a 300-kanal mansion in Bani Gala, Islamabad, worth , which he declared as a gift in his statement to the Election Commission of Pakistan. The mansion is located within a gated enclosure and is accessible through a private driveway.

Documents released by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in November 2019 revealed that Khan paid a total of in taxes over 37 years. According to the FBR, he was exempted from paying taxes during certain years within this period. On 3 January 2022, the FBR published its 2019 tax directory for parliamentarians, disclosing that Khan paid in taxes for that year. In 2023, Khan&#x27;s net worth soared to an estimated Rs315.95 million and in the fiscal year ending 30 June 2023, he paid in income tax.

== Political views ==

=== Domestic policies ===

Khan is described as a &quot;firebrand nationalist&quot; in the context of his political transformation and campaign speeches. He is described as employing populist rhetoric, combining promises of economic reforms, anti-elite messaging, and appeals to religious values. However, his criticism of Westernized Pakistani elites contrasts with his own privileged background and connections to the Western jet set. Khan&#x27;s proclaimed political platform and declarations include Islamic values, to which he rededicated himself in the 1990s; leftist economics, with the promise of addressing economic disparity and promoting social welfare; decreased bureaucracy and the implementation of anti-corruption laws to create and ensure a clean government; the establishment of an independent judiciary; overhaul of the country&#x27;s police system; and an anti-militant vision for a democratic Pakistan. However, Khan&#x27;s political journey has been marked by inconsistency, including his support for General Musharraf&#x27;s military regime before later opposing it.

In a 2012 interview with Barkha Dutt, Khan referred to liberals in Pakistan as the &quot;scum of the country&quot; and labeled them as fascists. Khan said that these liberals supported the bombardment and drone attacks on villages. He added that it was the liberals who backed the United States&#x27; policies including the War on Terror that had contributed to the rise of extremism in the country.

=== Foreign relations ===
In 2010, Khan said in an interview: &quot;I grew up hating India because I grew up in Lahore and there were massacres of 1947, so much bloodshed and anger. But as I started touring India, I got such love and friendship there that all this disappeared.&quot;

On Pakistan Day 2013, Imran Khan appeared on &quot;Capital Talk&quot; with Hamid Mir and called on the Pakistani government to apologize to Bangladesh for the atrocities committed in 1971 by the Pakistan Army. Just before a cricket match in Mirpur Stadium, Bangladesh, Mir asked Khan about the Bangladeshi crowd&#x27;s support for Pakistan, to which Khan replied, &quot;Bangladeshis will support the Pakistani cricket team.&quot; Mir then raised the issue of a government apology, to which Khan agreed, sharing that he had initially supported the army operation in 1971 but later learned the truth from his Bengali friends in England. Khan also recalled experiencing Bangladeshis&#x27; affection during a 1989 exhibition match in Mirpur. He stated, &quot;Army operations always created hatred in Pakistan and we must apologise to Bangladeshis,&quot; and emphasized that past mistakes should not be repeated in Balochistan and tribal areas. Imran Khan became the first Pakistani leader to demand an official apology from Pakistan to Bangladesh on live TV.
 On other occasions, he called the 1971 operation a &quot;blunder&quot; and likened it to the treatment of Pashtuns in the war on terror.

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats against Khan if he proceeded with his march to their tribal stronghold near the Afghan border to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, because he calls himself a &quot;liberal&quot; – a term they associate with a lack of religious belief. On 1 October, Hakimullah Mehsud in consultation with senior commanders of the Pakistani Taliban withdrew the death threats and offered Khan protection for the rally because of Khan&#x27;s opposition to drone attacks in Pakistan. A spokesmen said: &quot;We are ready to provide them security if they need. We endorse Imran Khan&#x27;s plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty,&quot; adding, &quot;the anti-drone rallies should have been taken out by the religious leaders long ago but Imran had taken the lead and we wouldn&#x27;t harm him or his followers.

On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 people, including some American members of the U.S.-based Code Pink antiwar group. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from the South Waziristan border. After an hour of unsuccessful negotiations, Khan announced that the rally would return to the city of Tank, about 15 kilometers away, where he was expected to address the crowd. Earlier, speaking in Tank, Khan emphasized that the rally would not force its way into South Waziristan. &quot;We want to reach Kotkai but we don&#x27;t want to fight with the administration because it is a peace march. We have already succeeded in our mission,&quot; Khan stated.
His perceived sympathy towards the Taliban, as well as his criticism of the US-led war on terror, has earned him the moniker &quot;Taliban Khan&quot; in Pakistani politics. Commenting on the moniker, Khan stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been called Taliban Khan for supporting the tribal Pashtuns and I&#x27;ve been called part of a Jewish conspiracy to take over Pakistan. I am of course neither.&quot; He believes in negotiations with the Taliban and the withdrawal of the Pakistan Army from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).

Khan describes himself as a pacifist and antiwar, notably opposing military operations, such as the War on terror, Iraq War, Siege of Lal Masjid, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the Gaza genocide, and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.

Khan views the Kashmir conflict as a humanitarian issue, as opposed to a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan. In 2013, he proposed secret talks to settle the issue as he thought the vested interests on both sides will try to subvert them. He ruled out a military solution to the conflict and denied the possibility of a fourth war between India and Pakistan over the disputed mountainous region.

In 2014, when the Pakistani Taliban announced armed struggle against Ismailis, denouncing them as non-Muslims, and the Kalash people, Khan released a statement describing &quot;forced conversions as un-Islamic.&quot; He has also condemned the incidents of forced conversion of Hindu girls in Sindh.

After parliament passed a unanimous resolution keeping Pakistan out of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in April 2015, Khan took credit and stated that his party was responsible for &quot;many critical clauses&quot; of the resolution.

On 21 November 2015, Imran Khan sent a letter to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, urging her to forgive Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, leader of the Bangladesh National Party. Khan claimed there was &quot;overwhelming&quot; evidence that Chowdhury was studying at Punjab University during the 1971 War, making it impossible for him to have committed war crimes. In the letter, Khan argued, &quot;If his execution is stopped, it will be in the larger interest not only of our region, but for the establishment of world peace and justice.&quot; Despite Khan&#x27;s plea, Chowdhury, along with Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed of the Jamaat-e-Islami, was executed in Dhaka on 22 November.

On 8 January 2016, Khan visited the embassies of Iran and Saudi Arabia in Islamabad and met their head of commissions to understand their stances about the conflict that engulfed both nations after the Execution of Nimr al-Nimr by Saudi Arabia. He urged the Government of Pakistan to play a positive role to resolve the matter between both countries.

While Khan was Prime Minister-elect following the 2018 Pakistani general election, Michael Kugelman, deputy director and senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center, remarked, &quot;One of the more striking elements of Imran Khan&#x27;s message on foreign policy is his overtly pro-Iran statements, It&#x27;s been quite some time since a top Pakistani leader has expressed such sympathies to Iran.&quot;

In 2021, Khan called on Muslim countries to pressure Western governments to make insulting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad a crime, &quot;likening this measure to laws against Holocaust denial.&quot; Khan added, &quot;We need to explain why this hurts us, when in the name of freedom of speech they insult the honour of the prophet... when 50 Muslim countries will unite and say this, and say that if something like this happens in any country, then we will launch a trade boycott on them and not buy their goods, that will have an effect.&quot;

Following the 2021 Fall of Kabul, Khan congratulated the Taliban for their victory in the 2001–2021 war, and urged the international community to support their new government. He also said that his government was negotiating a peace deal with the Pakistani Taliban with the help of the Afghan Taliban.

== Public image ==
During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Khan was a popular sex symbol. He became known as a socialite in English high society, and sported a playboy image among the British press and paparazzi due to his &quot;non-stop partying&quot; at London nightclubs such as Annabel&#x27;s and Tramp, although he said he hated English pubs and that he never drank alcohol. About his lifestyle as a bachelor, he has often said that &quot;I never claim to have led an angelic life.&quot;

Declan Walsh writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005, described Khan as a &quot;miserable politician&quot;, observing that &quot;Khan&#x27;s ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next.&quot; Khan has also been accused by some opponents and critics of hypocrisy and opportunism, including what has been called his life&#x27;s &quot;playboy to puritan U-turn.&quot; Political commentator Najam Sethi, stated in 2006: &quot;A lot of the Imran Khan story is about backtracking on a lot of things he said earlier, which is why this doesn&#x27;t inspire people.&quot;

In June 2011, a Pew Research Center poll showed Imran Khan with a 68 percent approval rating, significantly higher than Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani&#x27;s 37 percent and President Asif Ali Zardari&#x27;s 11 percent. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that same year, Richard Leiby described Khan as an underdog, stating that he &quot;often sounds like a pro-democracy liberal but is well known for his coziness with conservative Islamist parties.&quot; H. M. Naqvi similarly referred to Khan as a &quot;sort of a Ron Paul figure,&quot; noting that &quot;there is no taint of corruption and there is his anti-establishment message.&quot;

In 2012, author Fatima Bhutto criticised Khan for &quot;incredible coziness not with the military but with dictatorship&quot; as well as some of his political decisions.

Pankaj Mishra writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2012, characterised Khan as a &quot;cogent picture out of his—and Pakistan&#x27;s—clashing identities&quot; adding that &quot;his identification with the suffering masses and his attacks on his affluent, English-speaking peers have long been mocked in the living rooms of Lahore and Karachi as the hypocritical ravings of &quot;Im the Dim&quot; and &quot;Taliban Khan&quot;—the two favored monikers for him.&quot; Mishra concluded with &quot;like all populist politicians, Khan appears to offer something to everyone. Yet the great differences between his constituencies—socially liberal, upper-middle-class Pakistanis and the deeply conservative residents of Pakistan&#x27;s tribal areas—seem irreconcilable.&quot;

On 18 March 2012, Salman Rushdie criticised Khan for refusing to attend the &quot;India Today&quot; Conference because of Rushdie&#x27;s attendance. Khan cited the &quot;immeasurable hurt&quot; that Rushdie&#x27;s writings have caused Muslims around the world. Rushdie, in turn, suggested that Khan was a &quot;dictator in waiting.&quot;

After the 2013 Pakistani general election, Mohammed Hanif writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, termed Khan&#x27;s support as appealing &quot;to the educated middle classes but Pakistan&#x27;s main problem is that there aren&#x27;t enough educated urban middle-class citizens in the country.&quot;
Ayesha Siddiqa, in September 2014, writing for &quot;The Express Tribune&quot;, said that &quot;while we can all sympathise with Khan&#x27;s right to change the political tone, it would be worthwhile for him to envision how he would, if he did become the prime minister of this country, put the genie back into the bottle.&quot;

Nevertheless, Khan&#x27;s approval rating since he became Prime Minister remained comparatively robust for an officeholder in Pakistani politics, with a majority approving (51%), compared to 46% disapproval and 3% undecided. Other polls suggested his approval was as high as 57%. A survey by Gallup Pakistan published in March 2023 depicted an increase in approval ratings for Khan to 61%.

=== In popular culture ===

During his cricketing days, Khan featured in many advertisements and television commercials as a celebrity brand endorser. These included Pepsi Pakistan, Brooke Bond, Thums Up (along with Sunil Gavaskar), and the Indian soap brand Cinthol, at a time when Bollywood legend Vinod Khanna was also endorsing the same product. His popularity in India was such that it was &quot;unmatched in an era when there were no smartphones to take selfies. He was mobbed everywhere he went.&quot; The late veteran Bollywood actor Dev Anand even offered him a role in his sports action-thriller movie &quot;Awwal Number&quot; (1990), that of a cricket star in decline opposite an upcoming cricketer essayed by Aamir Khan, and as he refused, citing his lack of acting skills, the role eventually went to Aditya Pancholi.

In 2010, a Pakistani production house produced a biographical film based on Khan&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Kaptaan: The Making of a Legend&quot;. The title, which is Urdu for &quot;Captain&quot;, depicts Khan&#x27;s captaincy and career with the Pakistan cricket team, which led them to victory in the 1992 cricket world cup, as well as events which shaped his life; from being ridiculed in cricket to being labelled a playboy; from the death of his mother to his efforts and endeavours in building the first cancer hospital in Pakistan; from being the first Chancellor of the University of Bradford to the building of Namal University.

In 2014, Canadian rock band Nickelback released a music video for its politically themed single &quot;Edge of a Revolution&quot;, featuring a short clip of a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) rally among other protests. The brief clip from the rally shows red-and-green party flags along with a poster of PTI Chairman Imran Khan, who was the most popular opposition leader.

In 2015, shoemaker Haji Nooruddin Shinwari better known as Chacha Nooruddin, whose business was facing declining sales, gifted a pair of specially crafted Peshawari chappals to Imran Khan for his wedding. Although the double-soled design had been around for years, this gesture brought a surge in popularity. Nooruddin recalled, &quot;The special double-soled Peshawari chapal had been in fashion since long but when I gifted a pair of this specially designed new brand to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Imran Khan on his wedding, the shoe became an instant favourite with all and sundry.&quot;

Nooruddin, who imports pure leather from Italy, soles from Japan, and sheet soles from Germany, saw a turnaround as ministers from the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Khan&#x27;s large Pashtun following in Gulf states and beyond began placing orders. The chappal, now famously known as the &quot;Kaptaan Chappal&quot; after Khan&#x27;s nickname, quickly became a sought after item. The Kaptaan Chappal&#x27;s popularity has since extended to figures like Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman and Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.

In 2019, French designer Christian Louboutin rebranded the traditional Peshawari chappal, dubbing it the &quot;Imran Sandals.&quot; The move quickly went viral, sparking criticism for cultural appropriation. Within less than 24 hours of the backlash, Louboutin removed the product from his website and social media platforms. It remained unclear whether the sandals were named after Prime Minister Imran Khan, known for popularizing the footwear, or after painter Imran Qureshi.

==Controversies==
===Allegation of sexual harassment===
In 2017, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that she was sexually harassed by Khan, who was party chairman. Gulalai said Khan had sent her &quot;inappropriate text messages.&quot; Gulalai made the allegations and quit the PTI just prior to the election of a new prime minister, citing &quot;ill-treatment&quot; of female party members as the reason for leaving. The timing of Gulalai&#x27;s allegations was met with suspicion, as there were rumours that she had recently met with Amir Muqam, a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N). Gulalai denied these rumours, stating that she was not joining the PML-N.

Imran Khan denied the allegations and expressed support for Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi&#x27;s proposal to form a special committee to investigate the harassment claims made by Gulalai. Khan stated that he refrained from further commenting on the issue to avoid impacting Gulalai&#x27;s life but welcomed an investigation into the matter. He said, &quot;I have never sent indecent messages to her [Gulalai]. I challenge the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any.&quot; Khan also called for the commission to examine alleged messages sent by PML-N leader Amir Muqam to Gulalai&#x27;s father.

Khan called for scrutiny of a private media group&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief&#x27;s phone records, alleging that the issue was raised after four years for political reasons. He accused the PML-N of orchestrating the episode, claiming that &quot;Gulalai was used by the PML (N) and the party was also using [the media group] for its own interests.&quot; Khan demanded a comprehensive investigation, further alleging that &quot;money has changed hands&quot; in connection with the matter. He also criticised the PML-N, referencing past incidents involving figures like Nusrat Bhutto, Jemima Goldsmith, and Sita White, and accused the party of using such controversies for political gains. Khan described the PML (N)&#x27;s actions as &quot;shameless&quot; and vowed to &quot;chase them till my last breath.&quot;

===Remarks regarding killing of Osama Bin Laden===
While addressing the National Assembly of Pakistan in June 2020, Khan referred to the Killing of Osama Bin Laden, saying: &quot;The Americans came to Abbottabad and killed, martyred Osama bin Laden. What happened after that? The entire world cursed at us and spoke ill of us.&quot; Khan&#x27;s use of the term &quot;martyred&quot; (&quot;shaheed&quot;) sparked widespread criticism, with opposition leaders accusing him of sympathising with violent extremism and defending a terrorist responsible for global atrocities. Public criticism followed, with activists expressing concern about the impact on Pakistan&#x27;s international image. The speech came after the US State Department published a report stating that Pakistan was a safe heaven for terrorist groups. In response to the report, Pakistan&#x27;s Foreign Office said the report did not mention Pakistan&#x27;s role in &quot;diminishing the threat&quot; that Al Qaeda once posed to the world.

A year later, Khan&#x27;s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, stated that Khan&#x27;s comments were &quot;taken out of context&quot; and that a specific part of the media had &quot;played it up&quot;. When asked whether bin Laden was a martyr, Qureshi said &quot;I will let that pass&quot;, which Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said may have been an attempt to put the issue behind him and move forward.

===Alleged victim-blaming===
In 2021, Khan faced criticism after suggesting that women&#x27;s clothing could lead to an increase in sexual assault. During an interview with Axios journalist Jonathan Swan, Khan responded to a question about Pakistan&#x27;s rape crisis by stating, &quot;If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the man unless they are robots. It&#x27;s common sense.&quot; His comments were widely condemned. Women&#x27;s rights groups, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, demanded an apology, arguing that his remarks perpetuate harmful stereotypes by portraying men as &quot;helpless aggressors&quot; and women as &quot;knowing&quot; victims. Critics, such as politician Maryam Nawaz, labelled Khan a &quot;rape apologist,&quot; while activist Kanwal Ahmed expressed concerns about the message his words sent to perpetrators.

Then Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Raoof Hasan, argued that Khan&#x27;s comments on rape were taken out of context. Raoof stated that Khan&#x27;s government had taken &quot;groundbreaking&quot; measures to increase women&#x27;s rights and that Khan was attempting to stir a discussion through his statements. Zartaj Gul, a minister in Khan&#x27;s cabinet at the time, referred to Khan as a &quot;symbol of women empowerment&quot; and argued that his statements had been taken out of context.

Khan later clarified his comments in an interview with Judy Woodruff on PBS News Hour, stating, &quot;Anyone who commits rape, solely and solely, that person is responsible, no matter whatever – how much ever a woman is provocative or whatever she wears, the person who commits rape, he is fully responsible. Never is the victim responsible.&quot; Regarding his previous remarks on the issue, Khan said his comments were &quot;completely taken out of context.&quot; He emphasized that he would never say such &quot;a stupid thing, it&#x27;s always the rapist that is responsible.&quot;

===Comments on Pashtuns and the Taliban===
In his virtual address at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2021, Khan remarked &quot;Then all along the tribal belt (FATA) bordering Afghanistan, – Pakistan&#x27;s semi-autonomous tribal belt – where no Pakistan army had been there since our independence, they [the Pashtuns] had strong sympathies with the Afghan Taliban, not because of their religious ideology but because of Pashtun nationalism, which is very strong.&quot; His comments prompted outrage among many Pashtuns, who called on him to apologise. Khan made similar comments also on 11 October, which triggered a protest in Peshawar the next day by the leftist Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP). The Awami National Party (ANP) and the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) also condemned Khan for &quot;linking the Pashtuns with terrorists.&quot;

During his keynote address at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation&#x27;s (OIC) Extraordinary Session of Foreign Ministers on 19 December 2021, which was held in Islamabad to discuss the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Khan said that not allowing girls to study was part of Afghan culture, and that the world should respect that. His remarks were criticised by many people from Afghanistan and Pakistan, including former Afghan president Hamid Karzai. Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai also slammed Khan&#x27;s remarks, saying: &quot;I nearly lost my life fighting against the Taliban&#x27;s ban on girls&#x27; education.&quot;

===Misogynistic remarks===
In 2022, during his speech, Imran Khan referenced a clip of Maryam Nawaz&#x27;s speech, in which she mentioned his name multiple times. Khan remarked: &quot;Someone sent me a clip on social media of Maryam&#x27;s speech, somewhere. She took my name so many times and with so much passion, I want to tell her that Maryam, please be careful, your husband might get upset the way you call my name again and again.&quot; Khan&#x27;s comments followed Maryam&#x27;s repeated criticisms of him and his wife, Bushra Bibi. Perceived as inappropriate and misogynistic, the comments sparked significant criticism from both his opponents and some supporters.

===Reshuffle of the DG ISI===
In 2023, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Lt. General Asim Munir intended to investigate corruption allegations involving Khan&#x27;s wife, Bushra Bibi, during Khan&#x27;s tenure in June 2019. Shortly afterward, Munir was removed as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and replaced by Lt. General Faiz Hameed. Khan denied that Munir had presented any evidence or that this was the reason for his removal.

== Awards and honours ==


== Writing ==
Khan has published six works of non-fiction, including an autobiography co-written with Patrick Murphy. In the late 1980s, he served as editor of &quot;The Cricketer&quot;, a London-based cricket magazine. He periodically wrote editorials on cricket and Pakistani politics in several leading Pakistani and British newspapers. It was revealed in 2008 that Khan&#x27;s second book, &quot;Indus Journey: A Personal View of Pakistan&quot;, had required heavy editing from the publisher. The publisher, Jeremy Lewis, revealed in a memoir that when he asked Khan to show his writing for publication, &quot;He handed me a leather-bound notebook or diary containing a few jottings and autobiographical snippets. It took me, at most, five minutes to read them; and that, it soon became apparent, was all we had to go on.&quot; Khan&#x27;s autobiography was published in 2011, detailing his transition from cricketer to politician, as well as the challenges he faced in his philanthropic work.

Khan has also penned op-eds in various media outlets, including CNN where he advocated for conversation and restoration of damaged natural ecosystems.

In June 2024, reports emerged that Imran, while in prison, has been writing a book over the past few months and has already completed over 300 pages.

<text>Teresa Brewer (born Theresa Veronica Breuer; May 7, 1931 – October 17, 2007) was an American singer whose style incorporated pop, country, jazz, R&amp;B, musicals, and novelty songs. She was one of the most prolific and popular female singers of the 1950s, recording around 600 songs.

==Early life==
Brewer was born in Toledo, Ohio, the eldest of five siblings. Her father Ludwig Breuer, a German immigrant, was a glass inspector for the Libbey Owens Company (now part of Pilkington Glass), and her mother Helen (nee Kasap) Breuer, a housewife, was of Polish ancestry. The family were practicing Catholics, and she was a member of the Roman Catholic Church most of her life.

==Career==
Her singing career began almost as soon as she was able to walk and talk. When Brewer was 2, her mother entered her in &quot;The Uncle August Kiddie Show&quot; on Toledo&#x27;s WSPD and she was a hit with audiences. At the age of 7, Brewer entered &quot;The Major Bowles Amateur Hour&quot; and was soon touring around the country with them. When she was 12, her mother pulled her from the road to finish school. 

As she progressed through high school she was able to skip a grade. She would have graduated from grade 12 in 1948 at age 17, a year early. Around January 1948 she won a contest in Toledo that led her to the Stairway To The Stars contest show in New York. There she was a winner and the prize was a week&#x27;s performance at the Latin Quarter club.
 It was there that she met her first husband, Bill Monahan. Accompanied by her aunt Mary, she decided to stay in New York and do more performing. Being the legal age of 16 she was able to leave school, which she had disliked, and she did not receive a graduation diploma. 

An agent, Richie Lisella, heard her sing and took her career in hand, and soon she was signed to a contract with London Records. In 1949 she recorded the song &quot;Copenhagen&quot; (a jazz perennial) with the Dixieland All-Stars along with a number of other recordings. For the B side she recorded the song &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot;. Unexpectedly, it was not the A side but this B side which took off, selling over a million copies and becoming Teresa&#x27;s signature song. Another novelty song, &quot;Choo&#x27;n Gum&quot;, hit the top 20 in 1950, followed by &quot;Molasses, Molasses&quot;. Like many singers, she preferred ballads as they offered more opportunity to show off her vocal abilities, but the only ballad she recorded to make the charts was &quot;Longing for You&quot; in 1951.

In 1951 Brewer switched labels, going to Coral Records. Since she never learned to read music, she had demos sent to her to learn the melodies of the songs she would record. She had a number of hits for Coral and rerecorded &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; with the new label (and would record it a third time for a Mercury label greatest hits collection in 1962). In 1952, she recorded &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Away&quot; in a duet with Don Cornell, followed in 1953 by her best selling hit, &quot;Till I Waltz Again with You&quot;. In the mid-1950s she did a number of covers of rhythm and blues songs like &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; and &quot;Tweedle Dee&quot;. She covered some country songs including &quot;Jilted&quot;, &quot;I Gotta Go Get My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Go, Lover!&quot;. In 1956 she co-wrote &quot;I Love Mickey&quot;, about New York Yankees center fielder Mickey Mantle, who appeared on the record with Brewer. It was also reported that the two had developed a mutual attraction. Another 1956 hit was Brewer&#x27;s syncopated rendition of &quot;Mutual Admiration Society&quot;. In the same year her hit &quot;A Sweet Old Fashioned Girl&quot; demonstrated in one song her ballad and rock talents. In 1957 she recorded more covers: of the country song &quot;Teardrops in My Heart&quot; and the R&amp;B songs &quot;You Send Me&quot; and &quot;Empty Arms&quot;.

&quot;Teresa Brewer Showcase&quot; was the first LP she released; it was a collection of several of her early recordings with London Records but did not include her two hits &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; or &quot;Choo &#x27;n Gum.&quot; Most of the albums she released with Coral over the 1950s were typical LPs of the era, featuring more collections of songs and cover versions rather than thematic ideas – one exception was the Catholic-flavored Christmas album &quot;At Christmas Time&quot; (1957). The last charting hit she had was &quot;Milord&quot; in 1961. Brewer continued releasing albums throughout the 1960s, but the British Invasion in the mid-1960s quickly eliminated most interest in older singers and her record sales dwindled.

She appeared as Pat Edmonds in the 1953 film musical &quot;Those Redheads from Seattle&quot;. Paramount studio had done surveys in movie theaters asking people who their favorite singers were. She and Guy Mitchell won in their categories and were chosen for the film. In fact she won as America&#x27;s favorite female singer at least three years. 
Her song from the film, &quot;Baby Baby Baby&quot;, was successful as a single. She had natural brown hair, but had it dyed red for the role. She then kept it red for many years for her performances
===Later career===
Brewer re-emerged as a jazz vocalist on Bob Thiele&#x27;s Amsterdam label in the 1970s and 1980s, recording a number of albums including tribute albums to Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller and Irving Berlin. She also recorded with such jazz greats as Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Hines, Svend Asmussen, and Bobby Hackett. A landmark recording in her career was &quot;Softly I Swing&quot; (Red Baron Records, 1992), which was produced by Thiele and featured David Murray, Ron Carter, Kenny Barron, and Grady Tate. &quot;Memories of Louis&quot;, also recorded for Thiele&#x27;s Red Baron Records, paired her with a different well-known trumpeter on each track, including Clark Terry, Nicholas Payton, Ruby Braff, Freddie Hubbard, Wynton Marsalis, Roy Hargrove, Sweets Edison, Lew Soloff, Terence Blanchard, Yank Lawson, Red Rodney, and Dizzy Gillespie.

Her rendition of &quot;Danny&#x27;s Song&quot; for the 1972 album &quot;Singin&#x27; a Doo Dah Song&quot; would return on subsequent compilations, including &quot;Her Greatest Hits&quot; (1975), &quot;Portrait&quot; (1986), and &quot;Sixteen Most Requested Songs&quot; (1991). 
Brewer sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the 1968 MLB All Star Game.

One of her later singles, &quot;Another Useless Day&quot;, was written by Chas Hodges (later one half of &quot;rockney&quot; British duo Chas &amp; Dave) with Albert Lee featuring on guitar. Hodges&#x27;s band Oily Rags (also signed up by Bob Thiele) provided backing for Brewer&#x27;s album &quot;Teresa Brewer in London&quot; (1973), as well as many songs for &quot;Teresa Brewer&#x27;s New Album&quot; (1977).

She appeared on television as a guest star on such series as Ed Sullivan, Perry Como, Jimmy Dean, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1977, &quot;Sha Na Na&quot;, and &quot;The Statler Brothers Show&quot; in 1993.

Thiele, whom she had married, died in 1996, and Brewer never recorded after that. Altogether, she recorded around 600 song titles.

==Personal life==
Brewer married William &quot;Bill&quot; Monahan in 1949; the couple had four daughters, Kathleen, Susan, Megan and Michelle. They eventually separated, and the marriage was dissolved in 1972 shortly before she married Bob Thiele.

==Honors ==
For her contribution to the recording industry, Teresa Brewer has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street. In 2007, she was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

==Death ==
Brewer died of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neuromuscular disease, at her home in New Rochelle, New York, aged 76. Her funeral was held at New Rochelle&#x27;s Holy Name of Jesus Roman Catholic Church, where she was a member. Her ashes were given to her daughter.

==Influences ==
One of Elvis Presley&#x27;s first public singing experiences in 12th grade was performing a song of Brewer&#x27;s: &quot;Till I Waltz Again with You&quot;.

<text>Sir John Williams Benn, 1st Baronet, DL (13 November 1850 – 10 April 1922) was a British politician, particularly associated with London politics. He was the father of the politician William Benn, and the grandfather of the politician Tony Benn.

==Life and career==
Benn was born in Manchester, to a middle-class family, the eldest son of a Congregationalist minister, the Reverend Julius Benn (c. 1826–1883), and grandson of William Benn, but his parents moved the family to east London the following year, where they opened an institute for homeless boys. Benn was largely homeschooled and at the age of seventeen, he joined a furniture company. He later (1880) established a trade journal, &quot;The Cabinet Maker&quot;, which eventually became the furniture trade&#x27;s leading publication: when politics became his main interest, the family&#x27;s publishing business, Benn Brothers, was taken over by his eldest son Ernest Benn (1875–1954), who later renamed it Ernest Benn Limited. His niece was actress Margaret Rutherford; she was the daughter of Benn&#x27;s younger brother William Rutherford Benn, who was put into a lunatic asylum following his murder of their father, the Rev. Julius Benn.

When the London County Council was established in January 1889, Benn accepted an invitation to stand as a Progressive Party candidate for East Finsbury and was elected. Like his contemporary Will Crooks, Benn was active in the London Dock Strike of 1889, and, as an increasingly prominent local politician, was invited in 1891 to stand for Parliament as the Liberal Party candidate for St George Division of Tower Hamlets. He won election from the constituency the following year.

He was later narrowly defeated at the general election in 1895, but he concentrated on his continuing work as a London councillor, helping introduce electric trams to London&#x27;s streets in 1903. A year later, he returned to Parliament after winning a by-election at Devonport, a seat he retained until being defeated in 1910. In the meantime his son, 28-year-old William Wedgwood Benn, had also been elected to Parliament, winning Benn&#x27;s former seat at St. George in 1906. Benn senior was appointed a deputy lieutenant of the County of London in February 1905.

For his work as an MP, he was knighted in 1906 and created a baronet in 1914. John Benn remained a member of the London County Council until his death in 1922, leading the Progressive Party until ill-health forced him to relinquish that role in 1918. In his final election campaign he was victorious, defeating the Labour Group Leader.

<text>The New Culture Movement was a progressive sociopolitical movement in China during the 1910s and 1920s. Participants criticized many aspects of traditional Chinese society, in favor of new formulations of Chinese culture informed by modern ideals of mass political participation. Arising out of disillusionment with traditional Chinese culture following the failure of the Republic of China to address China&#x27;s problems, it featured scholars such as Chen Duxiu, Cai Yuanpei, Chen Hengzhe, Li Dazhao, Lu Xun, Zhou Zuoren, He Dong, Qian Xuantong, Liu Bannong, Bing Xin, and Hu Shih, many classically educated, who led a revolt against Confucianism. The movement was launched by the writers of &quot;New Youth&quot; magazine, where these intellectuals promoted a new society based on unconstrained individuals rather than the traditional Confucian system. In 1917, Mr. Hu Shih put forward the famous “Eight Principle”, that is, abandon the ancient traditional writing method and use vernacular.

The New Culture Movement was the progenitor of the May Fourth Movement. On 4 May 1919, students in Beijing aligned with the movement protested the transfer of German rights over Jiaozhou Bay to Imperial Japan rather than China at the Paris Peace Conference (the meeting setting the terms of peace at the conclusion of World War I), transforming what had been a cultural movement into a political one.

== Major positions ==
The movement promoted:
# Vernacular literature (Hu Shih&#x27;s saying &quot;Speak in the language of the time in which you live&quot;)
# An end to the patriarchal family in favor of individual freedom and women&#x27;s liberation
# The view that China is a nation among nations, not a uniquely Confucian culture
# The re-examination of Confucian texts and ancient classics using modern textual and critical methods, known as the Doubting Antiquity School
# Democratic and egalitarian values
# An orientation to the future rather than the past
In the view of the New Culture Movement, Confucian morality repressed the universal and natural experience of sexuality. They believed that sexuality was best considered in scientific terms.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Following the failure of the 1911 revolution, Yuan Shikai’s ending of the second revolution of the summer of 1913 forced many intellectuals into exile, some fleeing to Tokyo, while others sought refuge in Shanghai. In Tokyo in May of 1914, Zhang Shizhao founded the political magazine The Tiger that, while being short-lived, running only between May of 1914 – October of 1915, was one of the most influential political journals in China of the time. Chen Duxiu, as well as other intellectuals who would later become a part of the New Culture Movement in China such as Li Dazhao contributed articles, poetry, letters, and more to The Tiger. The Tiger was known for “probing the fundamental spirit of politics”, and the writers of this magazine grappled with the question of how underlying cultural values and beliefs shape politics, which would become important during the New Culture Movement.

In 1915, Twenty-One Demands were issued, and six months later, it became evident that Yuan Shikai had the intention to restore the imperial system. In the same year, Chen Duxiu founded the Youth Magazine (青年雜誌 Qingnian zazhi), which was later retitled as New Youth (新青年 Xin qingnian), thus marking the beginning of what would become the New Culture Movement. In its initial stages, New Youth was only a small operation, but it would soon become much more influential than The Tiger had ever been. Some of the articles published in the New Youth that were most influential in instigating the movement include: &quot;To Youth&quot; ( 敬告青年 &quot;jinggao qingnian&quot;), &quot;1916&quot; (一九一六年 &quot;yijiuyiliu nian&quot;), and &quot;Our Final Realization&quot; (吾人最後之覺悟 &quot;wuren zuihou zhi juewu&quot;). In 1917, Chen Duxiu and Zhang Shizhao moved to Beijing University where they became acquainted with the other individuals who made up the community of the New Culture Movement.

=== Rise ===
Two major centres of literature and intellectual activity were Beijing, home to Peking University and Tsinghua University, and Shanghai, with its flourishing publishing sector. The founders of the New Culture Movement clustered in Peking University, where they joined Cai Yuanpei, who served as chancellor. These founders include Chen Duxiu who served as the Dean of the School of Arts and Letters in addition to being founder of the New Youth, Li Dazhao as librarian, Hu Shih who was a leading figure in the literary revolution, the philosopher Liang Shuming, and the historian Gu Jiegang, among others.

Hu Shih had argued for the use of the modern written vernacular Chinese ( baihuawen) in literature before and especially in his essay published by &quot;New Youth&quot; in January 1917 titled &quot;Preliminary Discussion on Literary Reform&quot; ( wenxue gailiang chuyi) with the guideline: &quot;Do not imitate the ancients.&quot; On April 18, 1918, he published the followed landmark article &quot;Constructive Literary RevolutionA Literature of National Speech&quot; (建设的文学革命论 jianshe de wenxue geming lun).

The first vernacular Chinese fiction was the female author Chen Hengzhe&#x27;s short story &quot;One Day&quot; (一日 yi ri), published 1917 in an overseas student quarterly (《留美学生季报》 liumei xuesheng jibao). This was a year before the publication of Lu Xun&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; on April 2, 1918, and &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot; (second was not published until 1921), which has often been incorrectly credited as the first vernacular Chinese fiction.

=== Death of Yuan Shikai ===
Yuan Shikai, who inherited part of the Qing dynasty military after it collapsed in 1911, attempted to establish order and unity, but he failed to protect China against Japan, and also failed in an attempt to have himself declared emperor. When he died in 1916, the collapse of the traditional order seemed complete, and there was an intensified search for a replacement to go deeper than the changes of the previous generations, which brought new institutions and new political forms. Daring leaders called for a new culture, as the death of Yuan Shikai in June 1916 had opened the possibility of fundamental reform in the Chinese political sphere anew.

=== Literature ===
The literary output of this time was substantial, with many writers who later became famous (such as Mao Dun, Lao She, Lu Xun and Bing Xin) publishing their first works. For example, Lu Xun&#x27;s essays and short fiction created a sensation with their condemnation of Confucian culture. &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; directly implied that China&#x27;s traditional culture was mentally cannibalistic, and &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot; showed typical Chinese people as weak and self-deceiving. Along with this musicians such as Yin Zizhong joined the movement through music.

===Major figures===

==== Chen Duxiu ====
Chen Duxiu founded the &quot;New Youth&quot; journal, which was a leading forum for debating the causes of China&#x27;s weakness, as it laid the blame on Confucian culture. Chen Duxiu called for &quot;Mr. Confucius&quot; to be replaced by &quot;Mr. Science&quot; () and &quot;Mr. Democracy&quot; (). These two were regarded as the two symbols of the New Culture Movement and also its legacy.

==== Hu Shih ====
Another outcome was the promotion of written vernacular Chinese over Literary Chinese, the predominant written form of the language since antiquity. The restructuring of national heritage first began when Hu Shih replaced traditional Confucian learning with a more modern construction of research on traditional culture. Hu Shih proclaimed that &quot;a dead language cannot produce a living literature.&quot; In theory, the new format allowed people with little education to read texts, articles and books. He charged that Literary Chinese was understood by only scholars and officials (ironically, the new vernacular included many foreign words and Japanese neologisms (Wasei-kango), which made it difficult for many to read). Scholars, such as Y.R. Chao (Zhao Yuanren), began the study of the various Varieties of Chinese using tools of foreign linguistics. Hu Shih was among the scholars who used the textual study of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; and other vernacular fiction as the basis for the national language. Literary societies such as the Crescent Moon Society flourished. Hu Shih was not only one of the founders of the movement but also considered the leader of the vernacular faction with his promotion of scientific methods. The &quot;national language&quot; has another social and political function: it facilitates intellectuals to enlighten, spread new ideas, and create new cultures. In Hu Shi&#x27;s view, this is also the premise for the formation of modern state order.

Hu was among the influential New Culture Movement reformers who welcomed Margaret Sanger&#x27;s 1922 visit to China.{{Rp|page=24}} He personally translated her speech delivered at Beijing National University which stressed the importance of birth control.{{Rp|page=24}} Periodicals &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Journal&quot; and &quot;The Women&#x27;s Review&quot; published Hu&#x27;s translation, which contributed to the public debate regarding birth control.{{Rp|page=24}}

==== Li Dazhao ====
While serving as an editor for various newspapers and journals, Li Dazhao campaigned for a new culture and opposed the enshrinement of Confucianism in China&#x27;s constitution, and implored Chinese people to defend the nascent republicanism. He wrote articles promoting Western civilization, constitutional rule, and endorsing democracy.

==== Cai Yuanpei ====
Cai Yuanpei was a Chinese philosopher, the Chancellor of Beijing University, and he was also a friend of Chen Duxiu. Cai Yuanpei was involved in the New Culture Movement, as well as other similar movements such as the May Fourth Movement.

=== Foreign influence ===
New Culture leaders and their followers now saw China as a nation among nations, not as culturally unique. A large number of foreign doctrines became fashionable, particularly those that reinforced the cultural criticism and nation-building impulses of the movement. Social Darwinism, which had been influential since the late nineteenth century, was especially shaping for Lu Xun, among many others, and was supplemented by almost every &quot;ism&quot; of the world. Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, and Wu Zhihui developed a Chinese variety of anarchism. They argued that Chinese society had to undergo radical social change before political change would be meaningful. {{sfnb|Dirlik|1991}} The pragmatism of John Dewey became popular, often through the work of Hu Shih, Chiang Monlin, and Tao Xingzhi. Dewey arrived in China in 1919, and spent the following year lecturing. Bertrand Russell also lectured widely to warm crowds. Lu Xun was associated with the ideas of Nietzsche, which were also propagated by Li Shicen, Mao Dun, and many other intellectuals of the time.

=== Development and aftermath ===
{{Chinese Communist Revolution sidebar}}
When Cai Yuanpei, the principal of Beijing university, resigned on May 9, 1919, it had caused a huge uproar in the media across the country. This connected the academic discourse within the university with the political activism of the May Fourth demonstrations. The May Fourth Demonstrations of 1919 initially united the leaders but soon, there was a debate and falling out over the role of politics. Hu Shih, Cai Yuanpei, and other liberals urged the demonstrating students to return to the classroom, but Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, frustrated with the inadequacy of cultural change, urged more radical political action. They used their roles as Peking University faculty to organize Marxist study groups and the first meeting of the Chinese Communist Party.

Li called for &quot;fundamental solutions&quot;, but Hu criticized it as abstract, calling for &quot;more study of questions, less study of isms.&quot; The younger followers who followed Li and Chen into organized politics included Mao Zedong.

Other students heeded Hu Shih&#x27;s call to return to their studies. The new approaches shaped scholarship for the next generation. The historian Gu Jiegang, for instance, pioneered the application of the New History he studied at Columbia University to classical Chinese texts in the Doubting Antiquity Movement. Gu also inspired his students in the study of Chinese folk traditions which had been ignored or dismissed by Confucian scholars. Education was high on the New Culture agenda. Cai Yuanpei headed a New Education Society, and university students joined the Mass Education Movement of James Yen and Tao Xingzhi which promoted literacy as a foundation for wider political participation.

Many of the leaders of the Kuomintang, such as Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin and Dai Jitao as well as Communist members of the Kuomintang such as Li Dazhao, participated in the New Culture Movement. These figures played a major role in the restructuring of the Kuomintang along Soviet lines in 1922–1924.

==== Journalism and public opinion ====
Chinese newspaper journalism was modernized in the 1920s according to international standards, thanks to the influence of the New Culture Movement. The roles of journalist and editor were professionalized and became prestigious careers. The business side gained importance and with a greater emphasis on advertising and commercial news, the main papers in Shanghai such as &quot;Shenbao&quot;, moved away from the advocacy journalism that characterized the 1911 revolutionary period. Much of what they reported shaped narratives and realities amongst those who were interested in what was becoming the New Culture Movement. Outside the main centers the nationalism promoted in metropolitan dailies was not as distinctive as localism and culturalism.

In 1924, Indian Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore held numerous lectures in China. He argued that China could encounter trouble by integrating too much progressive and foreign thoughts into Chinese society. Liberal ideals were a major component of the New Culture Movement. Democracy became a vital tool for those frustrated with the unstable condition of China whereas science became a crucial instrument to discard the &quot;darkness of ignorance and superstition&quot;.

New Culture intellectuals advocated and debated a wide range of cosmopolitan solutions that included science, technology, individualism, music and democracy, leaving to the future the question of what organization or political power could carry them out. The anti-imperialist and populist violence of the mid-1920s soon overwhelmed New Culture intellectual inquiry and culture.

== Evaluations and changing views ==
Orthodox historians viewed the New Culture Movement as a revolutionary break with feudal thought and social practice and the seedbed of revolutionary leaders who created the Chinese Communist Party and went on to found the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. Mao Zedong wrote that the May 4th Movement &quot;marked a new stage in China&#x27;s bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism&quot; and argued that &quot;a powerful camp made its appearance in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a camp consisting of the working class, the student masses and the new national bourgeoisie.&quot;

Historians in the west also saw the movement as marking a break between tradition and modernity, but in recent decades, Chinese and foreign historians now commonly argue that the changes promoted by New Culture leaders had roots going back several generations and thus were not a sharp break with tradition, which, in any case, was quite varied, as much as an acceleration of earlier trends. Research over the last fifty years also suggests that while radical Marxists were important in the New Culture Movement, there were many other influential leaders, including anarchists, conservatives, Christians, and liberals.

The re-evaluation, while it does not challenge the high evaluation of the thinkers and writers of the period, does not accept their self-image as cultural revolutionaries.

Other historians further argue that Mao&#x27;s communist revolution did not, as it claimed, fulfill the promise of New Culture and enlightenment but rather betrayed its spirit of independent expression and cosmopolitanism. Yu Yingshi, a student of the New Confucian Qian Mu, recently defended Confucian thought against the New Culture condemnation. He reasoned that late imperial China had not been stagnant, irrational and isolated, conditions that would justify radical revolution, but that late Qing thinkers were already taking advantage of the creative potential of Confucius.

Xu Jilin, a Shanghai intellectual who reflects liberal voices, agreed in effect with the orthodox view that the New Culture Movement was the root of the Chinese Revolution but valued the outcome differently. New Culture intellectuals, said Xu, saw a conflict between nationalism and cosmopolitanism in their struggle to find a &quot;rational patriotism&quot;, but the cosmopolitan movement of the 1920s was replaced by a &quot;new age of nationalism&quot;. Like a &quot;wild horse&quot;, Xu continued, &quot;jingoism, once unbridled, could no longer be restrained, thus laying the foundations for the eventual outcomes of the history of China during the first half of the twentieth century.&quot;

<text>Self-hypnosis or auto-hypnosis (as distinct from hetero-hypnosis) is a form, a process, or the result of a self-induced hypnotic state.

Frequently, self-hypnosis is used as a vehicle to enhance the efficacy of self-suggestion; and, in such cases, the subject &quot;plays the dual role of suggester and suggestee&quot;. 

The nature of the auto-suggestive practice may be, at one extreme, &quot;concentrative&quot;, wherein &quot;all attention is so totally focused on (the words of the auto-suggestive formula, e.g. &quot;Every day, in every way, I&#x27;m getting better and better&quot;) that everything else is kept out of awareness&quot; and, at the other, &quot;inclusive&quot;, wherein subjects &quot;allow all kinds of thoughts, emotions, memories, and the like to drift into their consciousness&quot;.

==Typological distinctions==
From their extensive investigations, Erika Fromm and Stephen Kahn (1990) identified significant and distinctive differences between the application of the wide variety of practices that lie within the domain commonly, equivocally, and ambiguously identified as &quot;self-hypnosis&quot;. Based upon their distinctions, &quot;self-hypnosis&quot; practices can be separated into, at least, thirteen different types:
==History==
===James Braid===
The English term &quot;hypnotism&quot; was introduced in 1841 by the Scottish physician and surgeon James Braid. According to Braid, he first employed &quot;self-hypnotism&quot; (as he elsewhere refers to it) two years after discovering hypnotism, first teaching it to his clients before employing it on himself:
In a later work, &quot;Observations on Trance or Human Hybernation&quot; (1850), Braid provides probably the first account of self-hypnosis:
===Émile Coué===
Émile Coué was one of the most influential figures in the subsequent development of self-hypnosis. His method of &quot;conscious autosuggestion&quot; became an internationally renowned self-help system at the start of the 20th century. Although Coué distanced himself from the concept of &quot;hypnosis&quot;, he sometimes referred to what he was doing as self-hypnosis, as did his followers such as Charles Baudouin. Modern hypnotherapists regard Coué as part of their own field.

===Autogenic training===
Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz and first published in 1932. Schultz based his approach on the work of the German hypnotist Oskar Vogt. The technique involves a step-by-step progression that begins from physiological conditioning, such as muscle relaxation, breathing control and heart rate control. Then it advances to psychic conditioning through mental imagery, acoustic therapy, etc.

==Steps commonly used for self-hypnosis==
Self-hypnosis requires four distinct steps.
#Motivation. Without proper motivation, an individual will find it very difficult to practice self-hypnosis.
#Relaxation. The individual must be thoroughly relaxed and must set aside time to perform this act. Additionally, distractions should be eliminated as full attention is needed.
#Concentration. The individual needs to concentrate completely as progress is made each time the mind focuses on a single image.
#Directing. This is an option used only when the individual wants to work on a specific goal. The individual must direct their concentration on visualizing the desired result.

==Uses==
Self-hypnosis is used extensively in modern hypnotherapy. It can take the form of hypnosis carried out by means of a learned routine.

Hypnosis may help pain management, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, obesity, asthma, and skin conditions. When this practice is mastered, it can improve concentration, recall, enhance problem solving, alleviate headaches and even improve one&#x27;s control of emotions.

===Pain===
Fromm &amp; Kaplan observe that the value, significance, and importance of self-hypnosis is not just that it promotes relaxation, relieves tension and anxiety, and reduces the level of physical pain and suffering, but also that, in teaching patients self-hypnosis, clinicians sensibly recognize that they can&#x27;t be with their patients at all times—especially, at those times when they are in pain—and, through that process of teaching self-hypnosis, they actively provide their patients with a 24-hours-a-day-available &quot;tool by means of which they can learn to control and master it, or at least be able to live with reduced pain&quot;.
===Self-hypnosis and stress===
Patients who are stressed and/or lack self-esteem can be taught self-hypnosis techniques which can induce relaxation and/or strengthen their self-esteem. Specifically, once the patient is in a self-hypnotic state the therapist can communicate messages to the patient, allowing the relaxation and strengthening process to occur.

Often, when teaching self-hypnosis, a subject is taught a specific &quot;trigger word&quot; (that will only induce self-hypnosis when the subject deliberately uses the word to hypnotize themselves) to facilitate the rapid induction of the hypnotic state. Also, a phrase (often termed an &quot;autosuggestion&quot;) might be taught to the subject for them to repeat to themselves when in self-hypnosis.

In addition, since stress prevents well-functioning of the immune system, researchers from the Ohio State University came to a conclusion that self hypnosis to prevent stress can also help in protecting the immune system against the negative effects of it. They proved this by showing that students who performed self-hypnosis during stressful exam weeks showed a stronger immune system when compared to those who did not learn self-hypnosis.

===Childbirth anesthesia===
Self-hypnosis can help women who are in labor to alleviate their pain. Joseph DeLee, an obstetrician, stated in the early 20th century that hypnosis was the only risk-free childbirth anesthetic. Common self-hypnotic techniques include:
# Glove anesthesia: Pretending the hand is numb and placing it upon a painful region to remove the sensation there.
# Time distortion: Perceiving periods of time accompanied by pain as shorter in length and those free of pain as longer lasting.
# Imaginative transformation: Viewing the pain as a non-threatening, acceptable sensation (perhaps merely pressure) that causes no trouble.

===Other uses===
Self-directed thought which is based in hypnosis can be used for many other issues and behavioral problems.

==Research==
Reviewing the findings of three previous studies in this area, John F. Kihlstrom concluded: &quot;Comparisons of self-hypnosis with more traditional &#x27;hetero&#x27;-hypnosis show that they are highly correlated.&quot; At the same time, Kihlstrom questioned the extent to which most self-hypnosis qualitatively resembled the experience of traditional hetero-hypnosis.
