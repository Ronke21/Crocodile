<text>Wilford Woodruff Sr. (March 1, 1807September 2, 1898) was an American religious leader who served as the fourth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1889 until his death. He ended the public practice of plural marriage among members of the LDS Church in 1890.

Woodruff joined the Latter Day Saint church after studying Restorationism as a young adult. He met Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement in Kirtland, Ohio, before joining Zion&#x27;s Camp in April 1834. He stayed in Missouri as a missionary, preaching in Arkansas and Tennessee before returning to Kirtland. He married his first wife, Phebe, that year and served a mission in New England. Smith called Woodruff to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in July 1838, and he was ordained in April 1839. Woodruff served a mission in England from August 1839 until April 1841, leading converts from England to Nauvoo. Woodruff was away promoting Smith&#x27;s presidential campaign at the time of Smith&#x27;s death. After returning to Nauvoo, he and Phebe traveled to England, where Woodruff preached and supported local members. The Woodruffs returned to the United States just before the Saints were driven out of Nauvoo, and Woodruff oversaw forty families in Winter Quarters, where he was sealed to his first plural wives. He joined the advance company that traveled to the Salt Lake Valley without his family in 1847. After returning to Winter Quarters, Woodruff and Phebe left to preside over the Eastern States Mission.

Woodruff and his family arrived in Salt Lake City on October 15, 1850. He served in the Utah territorial legislature and was heavily involved in the social and economic life of his community. He worked as an Assistant Church Historian and as Church Historian from 1856 to 1889. He was married to three more wives between 1852 and 1853. In 1877, he became president of the St. George Temple, where endowment ordinances were first performed for the dead as well as the living. Woodruff helped standardize the temple ceremony and decreed that church members could act as proxy for anyone they could identify by name. He also ended sealings of members to unrelated priesthood holders. In 1882, Woodruff went into hiding to avoid arrest for unlawful cohabitation under the Edmunds Act. In 1889, Woodruff became the fourth president of the LDS Church. After government disenfranchisement of polygamists and women in Utah Territory and seizure of church properties, which threatened to extend to temples, Woodruff ended the church&#x27;s official support of new polygamous marriages in the 1890 Manifesto. Woodruff died in 1898 and his detailed journals provide an important record of Latter Day Saint history.

==Early years and conversion==
Woodruff was one of four sons born to Beulah Thompson and Aphek Woodruff. Beulah died of &quot;spotted fever&quot; in 1808 at the age of 26, when Wilford was fifteen months old. Aphek married Azubah Hart in 1809. In 1826, Aphek lost his mill and moved from Northington (now Avon, Connecticut) to Farmington, Connecticut. Woodruff attended school until he was 18 years old, which was unusual at the time. He survived having typhus and numerous accidents. At age 20, Woodruff left home to manage a flour mill for his aunt, and after three years, operated mills for other people until moving to Richland, New York, with his brother, Azmon, in 1832. During his time as a mill operator, he studied religion and became interested in Restorationism. Woodruff had his local Baptist minister, Mr. Phippen, baptize him without making him a member of the local congregation. Woodruff joined Smith&#x27;s original Church of Christ on December 31, 1833. He was impressed with how the missionaries (Zerah Pulsipher and Elijah Cheney) preached their message voluntarily and free of charge, and how they purported to heal the sick.

==Zion&#x27;s Camp and mission==
Woodruff left his home in Richland after members recruited him to join Zion&#x27;s Camp in April 1834. He met prominent church leaders, including Joseph Smith, in Kirtland, Ohio, before leaving with Zion&#x27;s Camp for Missouri in May. When Zion&#x27;s Camp left Missouri, Woodruff stayed to help members in Clay County, Missouri. He was ordained as a priest in 1834 and volunteered to serve a mission. After donating all his belongings to the church, Woodruff left Kirtland on January 12, 1835, preaching without &quot;purse or scrip&quot; in Arkansas and Tennessee. Woodruff&#x27;s original companion was Harry Brown, who later left Woodruff to return to his family in Kirtland. Most of the mission, Woodruff preached in small towns and villages in western Kentucky and Tennessee and supported new members there. Warren Parrish ordained Woodruff as an elder in June 1835, and Woodruff heard in February 1836 that Smith had called him as a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy.

Woodruff was dedicated to the Latter Day Saint Church, which distanced him from his family, who did not believe in the church. He returned to Kirtland in November 1836, where he studied Latin and Greek grammar at the Kirtland School, a school for adult education, which met in the attic of the Kirtland Temple. In January 1837, Smith called Woodruff to join the First Quorum of the Seventy. Three months later, over a period of five days, he participated in washing and anointings in the Kirtland Temple, accompanied by prolonged fasting and prayer and Charismatic experiences, such as speaking in tongues and prophecy.

==Marriage and family==
Like many early Latter-day Saints, Woodruff practiced plural marriage. Woodruff was married to ten women in total, although not at the same time. His first wife, Phebe, stated that she thought plural marriage was &quot;the most wicked thing I ever heard of&quot;, but she eventually embraced it.

His wives:
* Phebe Whittemore Carter (March 8, 1807 – November 10, 1885), m. April 13, 1837
* Mary Ann Jackson (February 18, 1818 – October 25, 1894) m. April 15, 1846, or August 2, 1846 (divorced in 1848 but resealed in 1878)
* Sarah Elinor Brown (August 22, 1827 – December 25, 1915) m. August 2, 1846 (divorced after 3 weeks)
* Mary Caroline Barton (January 12, 1829 – August 10, 1910) m. August 2, 1846 (divorced after 3 weeks)
* Mary Meek Giles Webster (September 6, 1802 – October 3, 1852) m. March 28, 1852 (died 7 months after sealing)
* Clarissa Henrietta Hardy (November 20, 1834 - September 3, 1903) m. April 20, 1852 (divorced in 1853)
* Emma Smith (March 1, 1838 – March 4, 1912) m. March 13, 1853
* Sarah Brown (January 1, 1834 – May 9, 1909), m. March 13, 1853
* Sarah Delight Stocking (July 26, 1838 – May 28, 1906) m. July 31, 1857
* Eudora Young Dunford (May 12, 1852 – October 21, 1921) m. March 10, 1877 (divorced in 1879)

Six of Woodruff&#x27;s wives bore him a total of 34 children, with three wives and 14 children preceding him in death.
Woodruff met his first wife, Phebe Carter, in Kirtland shortly after his return from his first mission through Southern Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Woodruff came to Kirtland on November 25, 1836, along with Abraham O. Smoot. He was introduced to Phebe by Milton Holmes on January 28, 1837. She was a native of Maine and had become a Latter Day Saint in 1834. Woodruff and Phebe were married on April 13, 1837, with the ceremony performed by Frederick G. Williams. Their marriage was later sealed in Nauvoo by Hyrum Smith. Due to a loss of records, this ordinance was later repeated by Heber C. Kimball in Salt Lake City in 1853. Phebe accompanied her husband on his 1837–1838 mission to the Fox Islands in Maine. During some of this time, she resided with her parents in their house in Maine. She headed west with her husband shortly after the birth of their daughter, despite her reluctance to leave home.

During their journey west, Phebe became deathly ill. She frequently slipped into unconsciousness starting on December 2, 1838. Phebe reported that she conversed with two angels who gave her the choice to live or die. They said that she could choose to live if she would accept the responsibility of supporting her husband in all of his future work for the Lord; she chose to live and persevere with the faithful. She recovered after receiving a blessing from Woodruff. Her firstborn child died of a respiratory infection in 1840 while Woodruff was on a mission in England. Phebe was among the members of the Relief Society in Nauvoo. In the late 1840s, Phebe was set apart as a missionary and served with Woodruff as he presided over the Eastern States Mission. Phebe was later numbered among the &quot;leading ladies&quot; who helped organize the Relief Society in Utah Territory in the 1860s through the 1880s. She was also a key figure behind the Indignation Meeting of 1870 that was an important step in the women of Utah being granted the right to vote.

Woodruff&#x27;s second marriage to Mary Ann Jackson ended in divorce a year after their son, James, was born in 1847. Woodruff&#x27;s third and fourth marriages ended in divorce only three weeks after their sealing, after the two young women started dating men their own age. In 1852, Woodruff married Mary Giles Meeks Webster and Clarissa Henrietta Hardy, but Mary died that same year and Clarissa divorced him a year later. In 1853, he was sealed to two more women, Emma Smith, age 15, and Sarah Brown, age 19. Sarah bore a son the following year, but Emma did not bear any children until she was 19. Emma&#x27;s first child died at age 13 months, and her fourth child, born in 1867, died soon after birth. In 1857, Brigham Young sealed Sarah Delight Stocking to Woodruff. Delight&#x27;s third child died as an infant in 1869. In 1877, Young sealed his daughter, Eudora Lovina Young Dunford, to Woodruff. Their child died a few hours after birth in 1878. Although Woodruff and Mary Ann Jackson were divorced, he provided a home for her and sent money to her to support her and their son, James. James came to live with Woodruff as a young man in 1863. Among Woodruff&#x27;s children was church apostle Abraham O. Woodruff. Woodruff&#x27;s daughter Phebe was sealed as a wife to Lorenzo Snow in 1859.

During Woodruff&#x27;s time as president of the LDS Church, his wife Emma Smith Woodruff accompanied him to public functions, and she was the only wife he lived with after Phebe&#x27;s death in 1885. She was a niece of Abraham O. Smoot. Although she married Woodruff, then age 46, when she was 15, she did not have the first of her eight children until she was 19. Emma was involved in the Relief Society, serving as both a ward and stake president for that organization. She also served as a member of the Relief Society General Board from 1892 to 1910. Woodruff spent more time with Emma&#x27;s children than his children from other wives. He corresponded most frequently with Emma&#x27;s and Phebe&#x27;s children, giving them advice on living a virtuous life and saving money. He built homes for his wives, and he sent money to his wives and children, probably based on their individual needs.

In the 1880s, Woodruff met Lydia Mary Olive Mamreoff von Finkelstien Mountford, who grew up Christian in Jerusalem. Woodruff and Mountford became friends, and she spent time with Woodruff&#x27;s family at their summer home. While historian D. Michael Quinn and others have speculated that Mountford was sealed to Woodruff as a plural wife in 1897, there is no evidence for it. According to Thomas G. Alexander, Mountford was away giving lectures in California while Woodruff was in Oregon at the time that Quinn postulated they were sealed.

== Missionary work and work as an apostle ==
===Mission in the east and England; ordination as apostle===
On May 30, 1837, a month after his marriage to Phebe, Woodruff left Kirtland with Jonathan Hale and Milton Holmes to serve a mission in New England. According to their accounts, the main places they preached were The Fox Islands, Litchfield County, Connecticut, and York County, Maine. Phebe joined Woodruff in Farmington, Connecticut, on July 16, where he baptized some of his relatives. Baptizing his family brought him great joy, saying that it was in fulfillment of a dream he had when he was young. Although Phebe did not accompany him on all of his journeys over the next year and a half, she stayed at various locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine—locations that he, to some extent, made his base of operations. Woodruff baptized over 100 people during this mission. In 1838, Woodruff led a party of 53 members in wagons from the Maine coast to Nauvoo, Illinois. Some of the party wintered in Rochester, Illinois, after hearing about the growing persecution of members in Missouri. They moved to Quincy, Illinois, in April 1839.

In July 1838, Smith called Woodruff as a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. He was ordained at Far West, Missouri, in April 1839 where the other members of the Quorum of the Twelve had traveled. He suffered from malaria in Commerce, Missouri, during the July epidemic. In 1839, he and John Taylor were the first two apostles to leave from the Nauvoo/Montrose area to go on missions to Britain. He spent over a month in the Staffordshire Potteries and then traveled to Herefordshire, where he preached to members of the United Brethren. Almost all of the members of the United Brethren converted to Mormonism. Outside of London, the missionary work in England was successful, and by August 1840, there were around 800 members, with local members acting as leadership and proselyting missionaries. Preaching in London was difficult, and Woodruff had dreams about serpents attacking him before he and his companions were able to baptize 49 people. Many converts left to join the other members in the United States. When he left England in April 1841, 140 members joined him in journeying to New York. Woodruff met Phebe in Maine, and they traveled to Nauvoo together in October 1841.

===Nauvoo and Winter Quarters===
In Nauvoo, the Twelve Apostles assigned Woodruff to assist with the church&#x27;s temporal matters in Nauvoo. He became co-manager of &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; in February 1842. Woodruff supervised the physical printing of the paper, and he and John Taylor also published a general interest newspaper called &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot;, starting in May 1843. He bought and sold real estate, helped clerk in a provision store, and farmed. He became a member of the Nauvoo city council and served as chaplain for the Nauvoo Legion, a local militia. He also helped organize the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge and the Nauvoo Agricultural and Manufacturing Society. As one of the church&#x27;s apostles, he was also a member of the Council of Fifty. He took detailed notes on the King Follett discourse. He joined the other apostles in a trip to the East Coast to raise funds for a temple and hotel under construction in Nauvoo, setting out in July 1843 and returning in November 1843. Woodruff and his wife, Phebe, received their second anointing in Nauvoo in 1844, making them members of the Anointed Quorum. In May 1844, Woodruff left on another trip to preach and promote Joseph Smith&#x27;s presidential campaign. News of Smith&#x27;s death reached Woodruff on July 9, and fellow apostles returned to Nauvoo in August.

The apostles called Woodruff and Phebe to serve in England. They left Nauvoo in August 1844, leaving their eldest child with a family in Nauvoo. They left their three-year-old with Phebe&#x27;s parents in Maine, bringing their one-year-old with them to England. Woodruff worked to square the mission account books and visited wards and branches throughout the United Kingdom, establishing the authority of the apostles after Smith&#x27;s death. Members in England tried to form a joint stock company trading with Nauvoo in cotton, wool, and iron. The company failed because of unrest in Nauvoo and problems in management. After hearing that members had been driven out of Nauvoo, the Woodruffs left England in January 1846. Woodruff picked up their daughter and brought some of his relatives with him to Nauvoo, but Woodruff&#x27;s relatives decided to join James Strang&#x27;s followers rather than move west.

Before leaving Nauvoo, Woodruff and Orson Hyde dedicated the temple on April 30, 1846. Woodruff oversaw 40 families, and they stayed at Winter Quarters. Many people got sick in Winter Quarters, and Woodruff&#x27;s 16-month-old son, Joseph, died of a respiratory infection on November 12, 1846. Phebe&#x27;s friend from England, Jane Benbow, also died, and Phebe went into labor 6 weeks early, giving birth to a son who died two days after birth. Woodruff joined an advance company that left in April 1847 to find a place to settle, leaving his family in Winter Quarters. Woodruff suffered various ailments, as did most of the other migrants. They arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24 and immediately planted crops. Woodruff learned to fly fish in England, and his 1847 journal account of his fishing in the East Fork River is the earliest known account of fly fishing west of the Mississippi River. Woodruff returned to Winter Quarters that October 31; Phebe was there and had given birth three days earlier to a daughter named Shuah. The apostles assigned Woodruff to preside over the Eastern States Mission, centered in Boston. Phebe was specially blessed to teach and be a mother in Israel, and they left Winter Quarters in June 1848. Shuah died, probably of dysentery, on July 22 during the journey east. Phebe went with the children to visit her father in Maine while Woodruff organized church work on the East Coast. He organized branches, preached, and resolved conflicts. In 1849, Phebe&#x27;s father and a sister joined the church. Woodruff led 200 members in traveling west, starting in February 1850. They arrived in Nebraska in May 1850, where the price of oxen and their drivers was steep. The trail was heavily grazed by other travelers, leaving little food for their oxen and half died. Woodruff sent word to Brigham Young that his party needed oxen, and a party from Salt Lake City arrived on October 8. Woodruff&#x27;s group arrived in the valley on October 15.

===Settling Utah===

Woodruff initially focused on building cabins, farming, and grazing his cattle. He experimented with different varieties of wheat. He sold goods from outside of Utah in a retail store. His efforts were not successful, and he focused on farming and herding in 1856. In 1852, Woodruff began serving as church historian. Phebe gave birth to Bulah in 1851 and to a son who died shortly after birth in 1853. Wilford adopted an orphaned Paiute boy named Moroni Bosnel in 1855. He also purchased a 6-year-old Paiute boy; it is unclear if the boy was part of the household as a slave or a son. An adopted son named Saroquetes helped Wilford Jr. manage day-to-day ranching duties in the 1850s and 1860s.

Woodruff served multiple terms in the Utah territorial legislature. He was a member of the legislative house from its formation in 1851 until 1854, and then served in the legislative council from 1854 until 1876. Woodruff promoted public schools and noted attendance statistics when he traveled to southern Utah. Woodruff served as a member of the 1862 Utah Constitutional Convention and the committee that drafted the appeal to the U.S. Congress to approve the constitution and grant statehood for Utah. This attempt to join the Union failed. Woodruff served as a member of the Provo City Council in 1868 and 1869.

Woodruff was also on the Board of Regents of the University of Deseret, where he chaired a committee to prepare spelling books in the Deseret Alphabet. Woodruff spent some time in 1854 educating his own children at home before public schools were established. He was president of a society for a lecture and discussion group called the Universal Scientific Society, founded in February 1855 and disbanded in November 1855. He also attended meetings of the Polysophical Society, a literary group including Lorenzo and Eliza Snow. The society stopped meeting after the Mormon Reformation in 1856. Woodruff was president of the Deseret Horticultural Society, founded in September 1855, which sought to find the most productive trees and bushes. By his own report, he had cultivated over 70 kinds of apples via importing and grafting, along with apricots, peaches, grapes, and currants in 1857. On multiple occasions, his products won prizes at the Utah Territorial Fair. Woodruff led the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society from 1862 to 1877. The organization encouraged experimentation and shared knowledge about what plants would grow well in the territory. The Utah Territorial Legislature chartered it in 1856.

Woodruff sometimes led ceremonies in the Endowment House after it was built in 1855, officiating every Saturday in sealings and endowments in 1867 to 1868. He served a &quot;home mission&quot; to reactivate lapsed members and call them to repentance, preaching for a renewed commitment to religion throughout the Mormon Reformation. During the time of the Utah War, he moved his family south to Provo in April 1858; they moved back to Salt Lake City in July. During this time there were no public worship services in Salt Lake City, and Woodruff and the other members of the Twelve Apostles organized groups of priesthood holders that met regularly to pray and preach to one another. Woodruff&#x27;s wife Sara lived and taught school in Fort Harriman in 1860; she returned to Salt Lake City by 1865. His wife Delight moved to Fort Harriman in 1862, and her parents also lived there. In 1866, Emma moved to a house on Woodruff&#x27;s farm just outside Salt Lake City. In 1868, Woodruff was elected to be part of the city council in Provo; Delight moved to Provo to facilitate his work there.

Woodruff was the founding director of Zion&#x27;s Cooperative Savings Bank in August 1871. He was also on the board of directors for ZCMI. When Brigham Young set up United Order communities in 1874, Woodruff helped organize United Orders in Provo, Pleasant Grove, American Fork, and Lehi, but did not enroll in the communalist program himself. Most United Order programs stopped functioning after a few months. Woodruff started keeping bees in 1870, and founded a society for beekeepers in Utah territory that year. He and Phebe moved to a smaller house in 1871, since their children were no longer living at home. Woodruff&#x27;s other wives still continued to bear children and needed larger places to live. Woodruff&#x27;s wife Sarah and his son&#x27;s family moved to Randolph, Utah, in 1871, and he built a house for Sarah in 1872. Woodruff bought new mowers and rakes, which he used at both Randolph farm and his Salt Lake City farm in 1873. He built a house for Delight in 1876 in Salt Lake City. He helped his older sons, Wilford Jr. and David Patten, with their own farming businesses. Phebe was still Woodruff&#x27;s most visible wife, appearing with him in public.

===St. George Temple President===
Beginning in 1877, Woodruff was the first president of the St. George Temple. This was the first temple in which the endowment ordinances were performed for the dead as well as for the living. Under the direction of Brigham Young, Woodruff was key in implementing endowments for the dead in the temple, in standardizing the ceremonies, and in giving various sermons to encourage broader understanding of the program. Woodruff helped John D. T. McAllister with writing parts of the temple ceremony. McAllister served as first counselor in the temple presidency and later succeeded Woodruff as temple president in 1884. In February 1877, Woodruff received a revelation that church members could act as a proxy in the temple for not only their own relatives, but for anyone they could identify by name. Woodruff stated that temple presidents were &quot;authorized to exercise discretion in permitting persons to be baptized for friends.&quot; In 1893, Lorenzo Snow made it a policy that heirs should request in writing for others to perform temple work for their relatives.

Woodruff spent his 70th birthday working in the temple in 1877. 154 women from St. George performed temple ordinances vicariously for women who &quot;had previously been sealed to [Woodruff] vicariously&quot; and those who were related to him, Thompson, or the Hart families. Two years earlier, in 1875, Woodruff performed baptisms for the dead on behalf of 141 of his relatives in the Endowment House and for over 900 more in that same year. Woodruff accepted Brigham Young&#x27;s daughter Eudora as a plural wife in 1877; their union produced a son who died shortly after birth. Eudora divorced Woodruff, probably in 1879. Woodruff, Phebe, and their living children (except for Susan) met and performed more temple work, and at this time, Woodruff adopted various relatives to himself in the temple. He also sealed five single women to his recently deceased son Brigham. He was baptized on behalf of the signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence and other Founding Fathers. He stated in a September 16, 1877, discourse that he had been visited by the departed spirits of these men. Many of the proxy baptisms for the Founding Fathers had been done previously in Nauvoo and in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City, but the proxy endowments for these men were first done in the St. George Temple. Woodruff also compiled lists of notable men and women, for whom he performed vicarious temple work with the help of Lucy Bigelow Young.

After Brigham Young&#x27;s death in August 1877, John Taylor became the new president of the church, and Woodruff became president of the Twelve Apostles. Woodruff chaired the committee to separate Brigham Young&#x27;s personal property from church property, finding that Brigham Young owed the church almost $700,000 in real-estate and other expenses. In 1879, George Reynolds was convicted of polygamy in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Utah&#x27;s U.S. marshal started looking for Woodruff, and Woodruff fled to Bunkerville, Nevada, northern Arizona, and New Mexico. A new Supreme Court ruling required the federal government to provide positive evidence of polygamy before convicting the husband, and Woodruff could appear in public again until the 1882 when the Edmunds Act was passed. The Edmunds Act outlawed unlawful cohabitation, which was easier to prove than polygamy, and church leadership advised men in polygamous marriages to live in one house with one wife. Prosecution of polygamous men began in earnest in 1884, and Woodruff went into hiding in St. George during 1885 and often wore a dress and sunbonnet as a disguise. He was able to visit Phebe before her death on November 9, 1885, but fearing arrest, did not attend her funeral, instead watching it from the president&#x27;s office. After Phebe&#x27;s death, he lived at Emma&#x27;s house or with friends.

== President of the Church ==
===Polygamy and legal disputes===
After the death of John Taylor in July 1887, Woodruff assumed leadership of the church as the senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Woodruff wanted to reorganize the First Presidency right away, continuing with George Q. Cannon as first counselor. Other members of the Quorum took this opportunity to raise grievances against Cannon, stating that he had defended his son John Q. too vigorously during his excommunication, to the point of hiding his crimes. The Twelve Apostles with Woodruff as its president presided over the church until the Quorum came to an agreement in April 1889. After George Q. Cannon apologized to the Quorum, they approved his appointment as first counselor. In 1887, the new U.S. marshal, Frank H. Dyer, told Woodruff he would not arrest him, and Woodruff could make public appearances again in Salt Lake City. Outside of Salt Lake City, deputy marshals vigorously hunted down suspected polygamists, being paid more with more convicts. In an effort to appear more attractive for statehood, Woodruff counseled local press not to excessively criticize the federal government and asked missionaries in the southeastern United States to soften their approach to decrease complaints from local ministers. He also asked leaders to stop preaching the practice of plural marriage. On behalf of the church, Woodruff courted the favor of businessman Alexander Badlam Jr. and prominent Republican Isaac Trumbo. The two men moved to Arlington, Virginia, under false names, seeking to persuade Republican congressmen to support Utah&#x27;s bid for statehood in 1888. After Utah was denied statehood, Woodruff personally traveled to California in 1889 to speak with politicians.

During Woodruff&#x27;s tenure, the church faced a number of legal battles with the United States. The Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862 made it illegal for religious entities to own property worth more than $50,000 in any territory, and the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887 put forth the procedure for confiscating Church property. Marshal Dyer became the federally-appointed receiver of church property, and he confiscated the temple block, the Gardo House, and other offices. The church paid to rent the properties back from him. Church leadership discouraged new polygamous marriages in Utah. Late in 1889, federal judges stopped approving naturalized citizenship for Mormon immigrant residents in Utah Territory. Judges cited a disdain for federal law, pointing to doctrines such as blood atonement and temple vows as reported from former members to avenge the government for Joseph Smith&#x27;s death. Other former members testified that an oath against the federal government was not part of the endowment ceremony. Another $3 million in church assets were confiscated in 1887. Judge Anderson ruled against the naturalization of Mormon residents. In response, Charles Penrose wrote a manifesto, signed by the First Presidency and the Twelve, in December 1889. This manifesto denied that the church had any right to overrule any civil court, denied the doctrine of blood atonement, asserted their right to criticize government officials, and the right of all Christians to believe that &quot;the kingdom of heaven is at hand&quot;. Historian Thomas Alexander stated that both the judge&#x27;s interpretation of church history and the manifesto were &quot;a selective reading&quot; of church history.

The Edmunds-Tucker Act also took away the right to vote from practicing polygamists and all women in Utah. Combined with the influx of non-Mormons, the church could no longer control political offices in Utah Territory, and the members of the Liberal Party achieved a majority over the People&#x27;s Party in 1890. In June 1890, the First Presidency told church officials that leaders were no longer allowed to perform plural marriages in the United States. Henry W. Lawrence replaced Marshal Dyer and threatened to confiscate the temples in Logan, Manti, and St. George, as they were not used for public worship. Woodruff issued the 1890 Manifesto, which officially ended the church&#x27;s support of plural marriage. After the manifesto was issued, judge Charles S. Zane stated that no further church property would be confiscated. Woodruff further clarified in hearings about confiscated church property that men with plural wives should &quot;cease associating with them&quot;, though Joseph F. Smith and Lorenzo Snow did not make such strong statements. When the First Presidency suggested issuing another manifesto to tell polygamous men from associating with plural wives, Woodruff said that a man who neglected his wives and children could face church discipline. Law professor Kenneth L. Cannon II states that Woodruff&#x27;s intent with the 1890 Manifesto was to stop the creation of more plural marriages but allow existing ones to continue. The judge in the hearing decided not to return confiscated property to the church, stating that while the practice of polygamy may have stopped, it was still taught as part of the religion. Lobbyists managed to obtain amnesty for Mormons who did not enter polygamy after November 1890, but polygamists still did not have the right to vote. When Democrats took office in 1893, they restored property to the church and civil rights to members of the church. Historian Thomas Alexander stated in his biography of Woodruff that Woodruff&#x27;s decision to stop polygamy was a significant transition &quot;from isolation to assimilation, from extremism to respectability&quot;.

Some Mormon historians, such as B. H. Roberts, never seemed to come to terms with the manifesto. Despite the manifesto, some Mormon historians have asserted that Woodruff continued to secretly allow new plural marriages to be performed in Mexico, Canada, and upon the high seas.

===Temple changes and church economic stimulus efforts===
Starting in 1847, members of the church sealed their relatives to a family member or friend who held the priesthood, since Brigham Young said that all marriages before the Restoration were illegitimate. Brigham Young also stated that children born outside of marriage should be sealed to the parent who lived the Gospel and adopted through a special sealing to a faithful priesthood holder. Woodruff and other members disagreed with the law of adoption. Woodruff and Heber C. Kimball discussed the law of adoption together in 1857, agreeing that they did not believe in the &quot;custom of adoption&quot;, and that sons ought to be sealed to the fathers in their lineage when possible. In a conference address from April 1894, Woodruff announced a specific policy of sealing individuals only to their direct ancestors. He also encouraged members to &quot;trace their genealogies as far as they can&quot;. Woodruff helped found the Genealogical Society of Utah to help church members complete generational sealings. In Wilford&#x27;s 1894 address, he also stated that widows could be sealed to their deceased husbands, even if their husbands had never heard the gospel. Woodruff stated that this change in practice was not a change in doctrine, since Joseph Smith had referred to a welding link between fathers and their children. Woodruff also encouraged presidents of the four temples in the Utah Territory to coordinate their temple procedures in 1893.

An economic recession in 1891 followed by another depression in 1893 affected the church&#x27;s finances. Bishops used fast offerings as well as tithing to help the poor, and as a result, less money ended up in church headquarters. From July until December 1893, the church was unable to pay the salaries of its employees. Woodruff tried to promote economic development with various ventures, including the Utah Sugar Company at Lehi. The company was not successful and created over $300,000 in debt for the Church. The church also supported local industries like coal and iron mining, the Saltair resort, and the state&#x27;s first hydroelectric generating facility. The church completed and dedicated the Manti and Salt Lake temples during his tenure. Woodruff also established Bannock Academy in Rexburg, Idaho, which later became Ricks College and Brigham Young University–Idaho.

===Political manifesto===
Moses Thatcher and B. H. Roberts attended the 1895 state constitutional convention as Democrats. Both were general authorities of the church. Roberts opposed women&#x27;s suffrage, while Woodruff and the First Presidency supported it. Thatcher had issues with chronic ulcers and a morphine addiction, and in the rare times when he was in good health, he often failed to attend meetings. Thatcher ran as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for senate. Heber J. Grant said that Thatcher should have consulted with the other apostles and the First Presidency before accepting the nomination for senate. Thatcher argued that the First Presidency did not have the right to limit a member&#x27;s political decisions. At a general priesthood session, Joseph F. Smith said that any obligations that take a member away from their religious duties should be discussed with their presiding officers. He said that any Melchizedek priesthood holder ought to have permission from his church leaders before pursuing a political office. Republican leaders connected Smith&#x27;s statements with Thatcher and Roberts&#x27;s political activity and used it to criticize the Democratic Party. Smith&#x27;s remarks became controversial, with some members calling for the church to not interfere in politics, and with others supporting Smith&#x27;s position. In response, Woodruff published a statement where he stated that the church did not wish to interfere with members&#x27; political endeavors. In December 1895, Woodruff said that Thatcher and Roberts would not be presented for the traditional vote of approval at April&#x27;s general conference until both repented. Utah became a state with a Republican majority in the state government. Thatcher refused to reconcile with the apostles and continued to experience ill health. George Q. Cannon drafted a &quot;Political Manifesto&quot; at Woodruff&#x27;s request. It stated that religion and politics had always been separate in the church, but that people in full-time church positions should get approval from the First Presidency before accepting a political nomination. All members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve signed the document, except for Thatcher. The First Presidency agreed to drop Thatcher&#x27;s name from the sustaining vote portion of general conference. Thatcher publicized his side of the dispute in a note in &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;. Church leaders asked for sustaining votes for the manifesto in local meetings, leading to some disputes. Joseph F. Smith, a Republican, wanted the manifesto to apply to all members, but Woodruff and Cannon disagreed with Smith. After several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Twelve disfellowshipped Thatcher, removing him from his position as an apostle.

==Death and legacy==

Woodruff died in San Francisco, California, on September 2, 1898, after a failed bladder surgery. He was succeeded as church president by his son-in-law, Lorenzo Snow. Woodruff was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Woodruff&#x27;s journals are a significant contribution to LDS Church history. He kept a daily record of his life and activities within the LDS Church, beginning with his mission to the southern states in 1835. Matthias F. Cowley, editor of his published journals, observed that Woodruff was &quot;perhaps, the best chronicler of events in all the history of the Church&quot;. The diaries are &quot;one of the significant records of 19th-century Mormonism&quot;. In an introduction to selections from Woodruffs journals, compiler Susan Staker wrote that the journals were &quot;public, official—and ultimately very male&quot;. In addition to writing in his diary, Woodruff wrote over 12,000 letters during his lifetime, sometimes keeping a copy for his files. In his &quot;Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, B. H. Roberts wrote that Woodruff&#x27;s record was a &quot;priceless&quot; documentary of the discourses of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. Woodruff&#x27;s diaries are featured prominently in Laurel Thatcher Ulrich&#x27;s book, &quot;A House Full of Females: Plural Marriage and Women&#x27;s Rights in Early Mormonism, 1835-1870&quot;.

Woodruff was an Assistant Church Historian from 1856 to 1883 and was the church&#x27;s eleventh official Church Historian from 1883 to 1889. Woodruff and his assistants compiled and edited historical documents from Joseph Smith&#x27;s and Brigham Young&#x27;s lives. They also wrote biographies of members of the Council of the Twelve. Edward Tullidge helped Woodruff write his autobiography in 1856.

Woodruff&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2006 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

==Millennialist beliefs and apocalyptic prophecies==
Throughout his life, Woodruff believed that the Second Coming of Jesus and a cataclysmic end of the world was imminent. On August 23, 1868, Woodruff preached a sermon in which he famously prophesied that New York City would be &quot;destroyed by an earthquake&quot;; Boston would be &quot;swept into the sea, by the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds&quot;; and Albany, New York, would be &quot;destroyed by fire&quot;. Speaking afterwards, church president Brigham Young stated that &quot;what Brother Woodruff has said is revelation and will be fulfilled&quot;. Woodruff believed that the United States would disassemble by 1890. In January 1880, he received a revelation referred to as the &quot;Wilderness Prophecy&quot;, which stated that enemies of the church would be destroyed before Christ&#x27;s Second Coming and reaffirmed the importance of temples.

<doc id="419038" wikidata="Q309227" url="?curid=419038" title="Lolicon">
<text>In Japanese popular culture, is a genre of fictional media which focuses on young or young-looking girl characters, particularly in a sexually suggestive or erotic manner. The term, a portmanteau of the English-language phrase &quot;Lolita complex&quot;, also refers to desire and affection for such characters (, &quot;loli&quot;), and their fans. Associated mainly with stylized imagery in manga, anime, and video games, &quot;lolicon&quot; in &quot;otaku&quot; culture is generally understood as distinct from desires for realistic depictions of young girls, or real young girls as such, and is associated with &quot;moe&quot;, or affection for fictional characters, often &quot;bishōjo&quot; (cute girl) characters in manga or anime.

The phrase &quot;Lolita complex&quot;, derived from the novel &quot;Lolita&quot;, entered use in Japan in the 1970s. During the &quot;&quot;lolicon&quot; boom&quot; in erotic manga of the early 1980s, the term was adopted in the nascent &quot;otaku&quot; culture to denote attraction to early &quot;bishōjo&quot; characters, and later only to younger-looking depictions as &quot;bishōjo&quot; designs became more varied. The artwork of the &quot;lolicon&quot; boom, which was strongly influenced by the styles of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, marked a shift from realism, and the advent of &quot;cute eroticism&quot; (&quot;kawaii ero&quot;), an aesthetic which is now common in manga and anime broadly. The &quot;lolicon&quot; boom faded by the mid-1980s, and the genre has since made up a minority of erotic manga.

Since the 1990s, &quot;lolicon&quot; has been a keyword in manga debates in Japan and globally. Child pornography laws in some countries apply to depictions of fictional child characters, while those in other countries, including Japan, do not. Opponents and supporters have debated if the genre contributes to child sexual abuse. Culture and media scholars generally identify &quot;lolicon&quot; with a broader separation between fiction and reality within &quot;otaku&quot; sexuality.

==Definition==
&quot;Lolicon&quot; is a Japanese abbreviation of &quot;Lolita complex&quot; (, &quot;rorīta konpurekkusu&quot;), an English-language phrase derived from Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955) and introduced to Japan in Russell Trainer&#x27;s &quot;The Lolita Complex&quot; (1966, translated 1969), a work of pop psychology in which it is used to denote attraction to pubescent and pre-pubescent girls. In Japanese, the phrase was adopted to describe feelings of love and lust for young girls over adult women, which remains the term&#x27;s common meaning. Due to its association with &quot;otaku&quot; culture, the term is more often used to describe desires for young or young-looking girl characters (, &quot;loli&quot;) in manga or anime, which are generally understood to exist within fiction. However, the meaning of the term remains contested, and it carries a connotation of pedophilia for much of the public. &quot;Lolicon&quot; also refers to works, particularly sexually suggestive or erotic, which feature such characters, and their fans. &quot;Lolicon&quot; is distinct from words for pedophilia (&quot;yōji-zuki&quot; and &quot;pedofiria&quot;; clinically, &quot;shōniseiai&quot; and &quot;jidōseiai&quot;) and for child pornography (&quot;jidō poruno&quot;).

The meaning of &quot;lolicon&quot; within the &quot;otaku&quot; context developed in the early 1980s, during the &quot;&quot;lolicon&quot; boom&quot; in erotic manga (see ). According to Akira Akagi, the meaning of &quot;lolicon&quot; moved away from the sexual pairing of an older man and a young girl, and instead came to describe desire for &quot;cuteness&quot; and &quot;girl-ness&quot; in manga and anime. Others defined &quot;lolicon&quot; as a desire for &quot;cute things&quot;, &quot;manga-like&quot; or &quot;anime-like&quot; characters, &quot;roundness&quot;, and the &quot;two-dimensional&quot; as opposed to the &quot;real&quot;. At the time, all eroticism in the manga style featuring &quot;bishōjo&quot; (cute girl) characters was associated with the term, and synonyms of &quot;Lolita complex&quot; included &quot;two-dimensional complex&quot; (&quot;nijigen konpurekkusu&quot;), &quot;two-dimensional fetishism&quot; (&quot;nijikon fechi&quot;), &quot;two-dimensional syndrome&quot; (&quot;nijikon shōkōgun&quot;), &quot;cute girl syndrome&quot; (&quot;bishōjo shōkōgun&quot;), and simply &quot;sickness&quot; (&quot;byōki&quot;). As character body types within erotic manga became more varied by the end of the &quot;lolicon&quot; boom in 1984, the scope of the term narrowed to younger-looking depictions.

&quot;Lolicon&quot; became a buzz word after the 1989 arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki, a serial killer of young girls who was portrayed by the Japanese media as an &quot;otaku&quot; (see ). As &quot;lolicon&quot; was conflated with pedophilia in the public debates on &quot;harmful manga&quot;, its meaning was replaced among &quot;otaku&quot; by &quot;moe&quot;, which refers to feelings of affection for characters more generally. Like &quot;moe&quot;, &quot;lolicon&quot; is still used by many &quot;otaku&quot; to refer to attraction which is consciously distinct from reality; some &quot;otaku&quot; identify as &quot;two-dimensional &quot;lolicon&quot;&quot; (&quot;nijigen rorikon&quot;) to specify their attraction to characters. The term has become a keyword in criticism of manga and sexuality within Japan, as well as globally with the spread of Japanese popular culture.

==History==
===Background===
In the 1970s, &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (marketed to girls and young adult women) underwent a renaissance in which artists, such as those of the Year 24 Group, experimented with new narratives and styles, and introduced themes such as psychology, gender, and sexuality. These developments attracted adult male fans of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, who crossed gendered boundaries to produce and consume it. The first appearance of the term &quot;Lolita complex&quot; in manga was in &quot;Stumbling Upon a Cabbage Patch&quot;, an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;–inspired work by Shinji Wada published in a 1974 issue of the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Bessatsu Margaret&quot;, where a male character calls Lewis Carroll a man with a &quot;strange character of liking only small children&quot; in an inside joke to adult readers. Early &quot;lolicon&quot; artwork was influenced by male artists mimicking &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, as well as erotic manga created by female artists for male readers.

The image of the &quot;shōjo&quot; (young girl) rose to prominence in Japanese mass media in the 1970s as a symbol of cuteness, innocence, and an &quot;idealized Eros&quot;, attributes which became attached to imagery of younger girls over time. Nude photographs of &quot;shōjo&quot;, conceived as fine art, gained popularity: a photo collection titled &quot;Nymphet: The Myth of the 12-Year-Old&quot; was published in 1969, and in 1972 and 1973 there was an &quot;Alice boom&quot; in nude photos themed around &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Specialty adult magazines carrying nude photos, fiction, and essays on the appeal of young girls emerged in the 1980s; this trend faded in the late 1980s, due to backlash and because many men preferred images of &quot;shōjo&quot; in manga and anime. The spread of such imagery, both in photographs and in manga, may have been helped by prohibitions on displaying pubic hair under Japan&#x27;s obscenity laws.

===1970s–1980s===
The rise of &quot;lolicon&quot; as a genre began at Comiket (Comic Market), a convention for the sale of &quot;dōjinshi&quot; (self-published works) founded in 1975 by adult male fans of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. In 1979, a group of male artists published the first issue of the fanzine &quot;&quot;; its standout creator was Hideo Azuma, who is known as the &quot;Father of &quot;Lolicon&quot;&quot;. Prior to &quot;Cybele&quot;, the dominant style in &quot;seinen&quot; (marketed to men) and pornographic manga (&quot;hentai&quot;) was &quot;gekiga&quot;, characterized by realism, sharp angles, dark hatching, and gritty linework. Azuma&#x27;s manga, in contrast, displayed light shading and clean, circular lines, which he viewed as &quot;thoroughly erotic&quot; and sharing with &quot;shōjo&quot; manga a &quot;lack of reality&quot;. Azuma&#x27;s combination of the stout bodies of Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s works and the emotive faces of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga marked the advent of the &quot;bishōjo&quot; and the aesthetic of &quot;cute eroticism&quot; (&quot;kawaii ero&quot;). While erotic, &quot;lolicon&quot; manga was initially mainly viewed as humorous and parodic, but a large fan base soon grew in response to the alternative to pornographic &quot;gekiga&quot; that it represented. Erotic manga began to move away from combining realistic bodies and cartoony faces towards a wholly-unrealistic style. &quot;Lolicon&quot; manga played a role in attracting male fans to Comiket, whose participants were 90 percent female in 1975; by 1981, the proportion of male and female participants was equal. &quot;Lolicon&quot; manga, mostly created by and for men, served as a response to &quot;yaoi&quot; manga (featuring male homoeroticism), mostly created by and for women.

The early 1980s saw a &quot;&quot;lolicon&quot; boom&quot; in professional and amateur art. The popularity of &quot;lolicon&quot; within the &quot;otaku&quot; community attracted the attention of publishers, who founded specialty publications dedicated to the genre such as &quot;Lemon People&quot; and &quot;Manga Burikko&quot;, both in 1982. Other magazines of the boom included , &quot;Melon Comic&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The genre&#x27;s rise was closely linked to the concurrent development of &quot;otaku&quot; culture and growing fan consciousness; the word &quot;otaku&quot; itself was coined in &quot;Burikko&quot; in 1983. Originally founded as an unprofitable &quot;gekiga&quot; magazine, the publication was transformed into a &quot;lolicon&quot; magazine in 1983 by editor Eiji Ōtsuka, whose intention was to publish &quot;&quot;shōjo&quot; manga for boys&quot;. Reflecting the influence of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, there was an increasingly small place in &quot;lolicon&quot; artwork for realistic characters and explicit depictions of sex; in 1983, &quot;Burikko&quot; editors yielded to reader demands by removing photographs of gravure idol models from its opening pages, publishing an issue with the subtitle &quot;Totally &quot;Bishōjo&quot; Comic Magazine&quot;. &quot;Lolicon&quot; magazines regularly published female artists, such as Kyoko Okazaki and Erika Sakurazawa, and male artists such as , dubbed the &quot;King of &quot;Lolicon&quot;&quot;, who produced 160 pages of manga per month to meet demand. Uchiyama&#x27;s works were published both in niche magazines such as &quot;Lemon People&quot; and in the mainstream &quot;Shōnen Champion&quot;. The first-ever pornographic anime series was &quot;Lolita Anime&quot;, an OVA released episodically in 1984 and 1985.

Iconic characters of the &quot;lolicon&quot; boom include Clarisse from the film &quot;Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979) and Lana from the TV series &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978), both directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Clarisse was especially popular, and inspired a series of articles discussing her appeal in the anime specialty magazines , , and &quot;Animage&quot;, as well as a trend of fan works dubbed &quot;Clarisse magazines&quot; which were not explicitly sexual, but instead &quot;fairytale-esque&quot; and &quot;girly&quot; in nature. Many early &quot;lolicon&quot; works combined mecha and &quot;bishōjo&quot; elements; the premiere of the &quot;Daicon III Opening Animation&quot; at the 1981 Japan SF Convention is one notable example of the prominence of science fiction and &quot;lolicon&quot; in the nascent &quot;otaku&quot; culture of the time. Anime shows targeted at young girls with young girl heroines, such as &quot;Magical Princess Minky Momo&quot; (1982–1983), gained new viewership from adult male fans, who started fan clubs and were courted by creators.

The &quot;lolicon&quot; boom in commercial erotic manga only lasted until 1984. Near the end of the boom, because &quot;readers had no attachment to &quot;lolicon&quot; per se&quot; and &quot;did not take [young girls] as objects of sexual desire&quot;, a majority of readers and creators of erotic manga moved towards the diversifying &quot;bishōjo&quot; works featuring &quot;baby-faced and big-breasted&quot; characters, which were no longer considered &quot;lolicon&quot;. At Comiket, &quot;lolicon&quot; manga declined in popularity by 1989 following developments in erotic &quot;dōjinshi&quot;, including new genres of fetishism and the growing popularity of softcore erotica popular with men and women, particularly in &quot;yuri&quot; manga (featuring lesbian themes).

===1990s–present===

In 1989, &quot;lolicon&quot; and &quot;otaku&quot; became the subject of a media frenzy and moral panic after the arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki, a young man who had kidnapped and murdered four girls between the ages of four and seven and committed sexual acts with their corpses. Widely disseminated photos of Miyazaki&#x27;s room revealed an extensive collection of video tapes, which included horror/slasher films on which he had modelled some of his crimes, and manga, including &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;lolicon&quot; works. In the extended public debates that followed, Miyazaki&#x27;s crimes were blamed on supposed media effects: namely, a reduction in his inhibitions to crime, and a blurring of the lines between fiction and reality. Miyazaki was labelled as an &quot;otaku&quot;, and an image of &quot;otaku&quot; as &quot;socially and sexually immature&quot; men, and for some as &quot;pedophiles and potential predators&quot;, was established for much of the public. In February 1991, there were &quot;doujinshi&quot; creators who sold their work through supportive comic book stores. This practice came to light when three managers of such shops were arrested for having a &quot;lolicon&quot; &quot;doujinshi&quot; for sale. The decade saw local crackdowns on retailers and publishers of &quot;harmful manga&quot;, and the arrests of some manga artists. Despite this, &quot;lolicon&quot; imagery expanded and became more acceptable within manga in the 1990s, and the early 2000s saw a small boom in the genre sparked by the magazine &quot;Comic LO&quot;.

==Media==

&quot;Lolicon&quot; media is loosely defined. Some define its characters by age, while others define its characters by appearance (those which are small and flat-chested, independent of age). &quot;Lolicon&quot; works often depict girl characters as innocent, precocious, and sometimes flirtatious; characters may appear in borderline or outright sexual situations, though the term can be applied to works with neither. According to Kaoru Nagayama, manga readers define &quot;lolicon&quot; works as those &quot;with a heroine younger than a middle school student&quot;, a definition which can vary from characters under age 18 for &quot;society at large&quot;, to characters &quot;younger than gradeschool-aged&quot; for &quot;fanatics&quot;, and to &quot;kindergarteners&quot; for &quot;more pedophiliac readers&quot;. Girl characters in &quot;lolicon&quot; can display a contradictory performance of age in which their body, behavior, and role in a story conflict; for example, &quot;lolibaba&quot; (&quot;Lolita granny&quot;) characters speak and behave with the mannerisms of older women, which runs in contrast with their appearance or other aspects of their behaviors that may be seen as youthful. Curvy hips and other secondary sex characteristics similarly appear as features in many of the genre&#x27;s characters. Plot devices often explain the young appearance of characters who are non-human or actually much older, although this is not always the case.

Akira Akagi identifies themes in &quot;lolicon&quot; manga including sadomasochism, &quot;groping objects&quot; (alien tentacles or robots in the role of the penis), &quot;mecha fetishes&quot; (combinations of a machine and a girl), erotic parodies of mainstream manga and anime, and &quot;simply indecent or perverted stuff&quot;, also noting common themes of lesbianism and masturbation. Media scholar Setsu Shigematsu argues that forms of substitution and mimicry enable &quot;lolicon&quot; to &quot;transform straight sex into a parodic form&quot;. More extreme works depict themes including coercion, rape, incest, bondage, and hermaphroditism. Nagayama argues that most pornographic &quot;lolicon&quot; manga deal with a &quot;consciousness of sin&quot;, or a sense of taboo and guilt in its consumption. Some manga manage this by portraying the girl as enjoying the experience in the end, while others represent the girl as the active partner in sex who seduces men to her. Other &quot;lolicon&quot; manga, where &quot;men are absolute evil and girls are pitiable victims&quot;, indulge in the &quot;pleasure of sin&quot; through the breaking of taboos, which he argues affirms the fragility of the characters. He posits that manga depicting sex between children avoid the &quot;consciousness of sin&quot; via mutual innocence, while also thematizing nostalgia and an idealized past, while other &quot;lolicon&quot; manga accomplish this through characters with especially unrealistic and &quot;moe&quot; designs, where &quot;it is precisely because fiction is distinguished from reality as fiction that one can experience &quot;moe&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Lolicon&quot; manga, often published as &quot;dōjinshi&quot; or compiled in anthology magazines, is mostly consumed by male audiences, though Nagayama notes that the works of have &quot;resonated with female readers&quot; and &quot;earned the support of women&quot;. Other notable artists include Aguda Wanyan, , and female creators Erika Wada and . &quot;Lolicon&quot; imagery is a prominent theme in Superflat, a manga-influenced art movement founded by Takashi Murakami. Superflat artists whose works incorporate &quot;lolicon&quot; include Mr. and Henmaru Machino.

=== Relation to &quot;moe&quot; ===
In the 1990s, &quot;lolicon&quot; imagery evolved and contributed to the mainstream development of &quot;moe&quot;, the generalized affective response to fictional characters (typically &quot;bishōjo&quot; characters in manga, anime, and computer games) and its associated design elements. The &quot;bishōjo&quot; character form moved from niche, &quot;otaku&quot; publications to mainstream manga magazines, and saw explosive popularity in the decade with the rise of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games and anime series such as &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, which pioneered media and merchandising based on fan affection for their female protagonists. &quot;Moe&quot; characters, which tend to be physically immature girl characters exemplified by cuteness, are ubiquitous in contemporary manga and anime. In contrast to &quot;lolicon&quot;, sexuality in &quot;moe&quot; is treated indirectly or not at all; the &quot;moe&quot; response is often defined with emphasis on platonic love. John Oppliger of &quot;AnimeNation&quot; identifies &quot;Ro-Kyu-Bu!&quot;, &quot;Kodomo no Jikan&quot;, and &quot;Moetan&quot; as examples of series which challenge the distinction between &quot;moe&quot; and &quot;lolicon&quot; through use of sexual innuendo, commenting that they &quot;satire the chaste sanctity of the &quot;moé&quot; phenomenon&quot; and &quot;poke fun at viewers and the arbitrary delineations that viewers assert&quot;. &quot;&quot;Moe&quot;-style&quot; &quot;lolicon&quot; works depict mild eroticism, such as glimpses of underwear, and forgo explicit sex.

== Legality ==
Child pornography laws in some countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, have expanded since the 1990s to include sexually explicit depictions of fictional child characters, while those in other countries, including Japan, exclude fiction from relevant definitions. In 1999, Japan passed a national law criminalizing the production and distribution of child pornography. The law&#x27;s original draft included depictions of fictional children in its definition of child pornography; after &quot;criticism from many in Japan&quot;, this text was removed in the final version. In 2014, Japan&#x27;s parliament amended the 1999 law to criminalize possession of child pornography; the 2013 draft introduced by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which maintained the existing legal definition, included a provision for a government investigation on whether manga, anime, and computer-generated images &quot;similar to child pornography&quot; were connected to child sexual abuse, which would be followed by a later decision on regulation. This provision was opposed by manga-related organizations, including the Japan Cartoonists Association, which argued that regulation would infringe upon freedom of expression and negatively impact the industry. The provision was removed from the final version of the law, which took effect in 2015.

&quot;Lolicon&quot; media is a common target of local ordinances in Japan which restrict distribution of materials designated &quot;harmful to the healthy development of youth&quot;, which were strengthened throughout the 1990s and 2000s. An amendment proposed in 2010 to the Tokyo law on material banned from sale to minors (described by Vice Governor Naoki Inose as targeting non-pornographic &quot;lolicon&quot; manga, writing that &quot;We had regulation for &quot;eromanga&quot;, but not for &quot;lolicon&quot;&quot;) restricted depictions of &quot;non-existent youths&quot; who appeared under age 18 and were portrayed in &quot;anti-social sexual situations&quot;. After heavy opposition from manga creators, academics, and fans, the bill was rejected in June 2010 by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly; however, a new revision passed in December 2010 which restricts &quot;manga, anime, and computer games&quot; where any characters engage in &quot;sexual or pseudo sexual acts that would be illegal in real life&quot; depicted in a way that &quot;glorifies or exaggerates&quot; such acts. In 2011, several manga were listed for restriction, including &quot;&quot; (&quot;My Wife Is an Elementary Student&quot;); it was published online by J-Comi, avoiding restriction.

Sexualized depictions of young girl characters have also been subject to censorship and restriction outside of Japan. In 2006, North American publisher Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga series &quot;Kodomo no Jikan&quot; for release under the title &quot;Nymphet&quot;, but cancelled its plans in 2007 after vendor cancellations. In a statement, the company stated that the manga &quot;cannot be considered appropriate for the US market by any reasonable standard&quot;. In 2020, Australian senator Stirling Griff criticized the Australian Classification Board for giving ratings to manga and anime depicting &quot;child exploitation&quot;, and called for a review of classification regulations; later that year, the board banned the import and sale of three volumes of the light novel series &quot;No Game No Life&quot; for sexual depiction of young characters. Some online platforms, including Discord, Reddit, and Twitter, actively ban &quot;lolicon&quot; content.

=== Debate ===
Explaining the exclusion of &quot;lolicon&quot; material from the 2014 child pornography law amendment, an LDP lawmaker stated that &quot;manga, anime, and CG child pornography don&#x27;t directly violate the rights of girls or boys&quot; and that &quot;it has not been scientifically validated that it even indirectly causes damage&quot;. Manga creators and activists argue that the Japanese constitution guarantees artistic freedom of expression, and that laws restricting &quot;lolicon&quot; material would be unconstitutional. Statistically, sexual abuse of minors in Japan has declined since the 1960s and 1970s as the prevalence of &quot;lolicon&quot; media has increased; cultural anthropologist Patrick W. Galbraith interprets this as evidence that &quot;lolicon&quot; imagery does not necessarily influence crimes, while Steven Smet suggests that &quot;lolicon&quot; is an &quot;exorcism of fantasies&quot; that contributes to Japan&#x27;s low crime rates. Drawing on his fieldwork, Galbraith argues that &quot;otaku&quot; culture collectively promotes media literacy and an ethical position of separating fiction and reality, especially when the conflation of the two would be dangerous. A 2012 report by the Sexologisk Klinik for the Danish government found no evidence that individuals that view cartoons and drawings depicting fictitious child sexual abuse are more likely to engage in child sexual abuse in the real world. Sharalyn Orbaugh argues that manga depicting underage sexuality can help victims of child sexual abuse to work through their own trauma, and that there is greater harm in regulating sexual expression than potential harm caused by such manga.

Legal scholar Hiroshi Nakasatomi opines that &quot;lolicon&quot; material can distort consumers&#x27; sexual desires and induce crime, a view shared by the non-profit organization CASPAR, whose founder Kondo Mitsue argues that &quot;freedom of expression does not allow for the depiction of little girls being violently raped, depriving them of their basic human rights&quot;. Some critics, such as the non-profit organization , argue that &quot;lolicon&quot; works can be used for sexual grooming, and that they encourage a culture which accepts sexual abuse of children. In 2015, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale and Sexual Exploitation of Children, Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, called for further discussion and research on &quot;manga depicting extreme child pornography&quot; and a resultant &quot;banalization of child sexual abuse&quot; in Japan, and called for a ban on such material. Guidelines released in 2019 by the United Nations Human Rights Committee encouraged state parties to include explicit drawings of fictional children in laws against child pornography, &quot;in particular when such representations are used as part of a process to sexually exploit children&quot;. Feminist critic Kuniko Funabashi argues that the themes of &quot;lolicon&quot; material contribute to sexual violence by portraying girls passively and by &quot;presenting the female body as the man&#x27;s possession&quot;. Legal scholar Shin&#x27;ichirō Harata argues that child pornography laws should not collapse reality and fiction together, but also that fans should not dismiss an ambivalence represented by &quot;lolicon&quot;. He describes the practice of keeping the two separated as the &quot;ethics of &quot;moe&quot;&quot;, or &quot;responsibility of &quot;otaku&quot;&quot;.

== Analysis ==
Culture and media scholars responding to &quot;lolicon&quot; generally identify it as distinct from attraction to real young girls. Cultural anthropologist Patrick W. Galbraith finds that &quot;from early writings to the present, researchers suggest that &quot;lolicon&quot; artists are playing with symbols and working with tropes, which does not reflect or contribute to sexual pathology or crime&quot;. Psychologist Tamaki Saitō, who has conducted clinical work with &quot;otaku&quot;, highlights an estrangement of &quot;lolicon&quot; desires from reality as part of a distinction for &quot;otaku&quot; between &quot;textual and actual sexuality&quot;, and observes that &quot;the vast majority of &quot;otaku&quot; are not pedophiles in actual life&quot;. Manga researcher Yukari Fujimoto argues that &quot;lolicon&quot; desire &quot;is not for a child, but for the image itself&quot;, and that this is understood by those &quot;brought up in [Japan&#x27;s] culture of drawing and fantasy&quot;. Sociologist Mark McLelland identifies &quot;lolicon&quot; and &quot;yaoi&quot; as &quot;self-consciously anti-realist&quot; genres, given a rejection by fans and creators of &quot;three-dimensionality&quot; in favor of &quot;two-dimensionality&quot;, and compares &quot;lolicon&quot; to the &quot;yaoi&quot; fandom, in which fans consume depictions of homosexuality which &quot;lack any correspondent in the real world&quot;. Setsu Shigematsu argues that &quot;lolicon&quot; reflects a shift in &quot;erotic investment&quot; from reality to &quot;two-dimensional figures of desire&quot;. Queer theorist Yuu Matsuura criticizes the classification of &quot;lolicon&quot; works as &quot;child pornography&quot; as an expression of &quot;human-oriented sexualism&quot; which marginalizes fictosexuality, or &quot;nijikon&quot;, describing sexual or affective attraction towards two-dimensional characters.

Many scholars also identify &quot;lolicon&quot; as a form of self-expression on the part of its male creators and consumers. Sociologist Sharon Kinsella suggests that for &quot;lolicon&quot; fans, &quot;the infantilized female object of desire [...] has crossed over to become an aspect of their own self image and sexuality&quot;. Akira Akagi argues that &quot;lolicon&quot; manga represented a notable shift in reader identification from the &quot;hero&quot; penetrator common to pornographic &quot;gekiga&quot;: &quot;&quot;Lolicon&quot; readers do not need a penis for pleasure, but rather they need the ecstasy of the girl. [...] They identify with the girl, and get caught up in a masochistic pleasure.&quot; Manga critic Gō Itō views this as an &quot;abstract desire&quot;, quoting a &quot;lolicon&quot; artist who told him that &quot;he was the girl who is raped in his manga&quot;, reflecting a feeling of being &quot;raped by society, or by the world&quot;. Kaoru Nagayama posits that &quot;lolicon&quot; readers adopt a fluid perspective that alternates between that of an omniscient voyeur and the multiple characters in a work, reflecting an active reader role and a projection onto girl characters. Writing in &quot;The Book of Otaku&quot; (1989), feminist Chizuko Ueno argued that &quot;lolicon&quot;, as an orientation towards fictional &quot;bishōjo&quot;, is &quot;completely different from pedophilia&quot;, and characterized it as a desire to &quot;be part of the &#x27;cute&#x27; world of &quot;shōjo&quot;&quot; for male fans of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga who &quot;find it too much to be a man&quot;.

Several scholars identify the emergence of &quot;lolicon&quot; with changes in Japanese gender relations. Sociologist Kimio Itō attributes the rise of &quot;lolicon&quot; manga to a shift in the 1970s and 1980s, when boys, driven by a feeling that girls were &quot;surpassing them in terms of willpower and action&quot;, turned to the &quot;world of imagination&quot;, in which young girl characters are &quot;easy to control&quot;. Kinsella interprets &quot;lolicon&quot; as part of a &quot;gaze of both fear and desire&quot; stimulated by the growing power of women in society, and as a reactive desire to see the &quot;shōjo&quot; &quot;infantilized, undressed, and subordinate&quot;. Media scholar Chizuko Naitō views &quot;lolicon&quot; as reflecting a broader &quot;societal desire&quot; for young girls as sex symbols in Japan (which she calls a &quot;loliconized society&quot;). Cultural anthropologist Christine Yano argues that eroticized imagery of the &quot;shōjo&quot;, &quot;real or fictive&quot;, reflects &quot;heteronormative pedophilia&quot; in which emphasis is placed on the ephemerality of childhood: &quot;it is &quot;as child&quot; that [the &quot;shōjo&quot;] becomes precious as a transitory figure threatened by impending adulthood&quot;.

Light was born to a Jewish family in Trenton, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Pearl Sue (née Hollander), a model, and Sidney Licht, an accountant. Light graduated from high school in 1966 at St. Mary&#x27;s Hall–Doane Academy in Burlington, New Jersey.
She graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in drama. She recalled graduating with a class of 15 actors who were there all four years. She said &quot;it was a really rigorous program and I thank God for it because it was an amazing training program.&quot; She made her professional debut on stage in &quot;Richard III&quot; at the &quot;California Shakespeare Festival&quot; in 1970.

==Career==

===Early work and breakthrough===
Light made her Broadway debut in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in 1975. She also starred in the 1976 Broadway play &quot;Herzl&quot;. Light also acted for such theatre companies as the Milwaukee Repertory Theater and the Seattle Repertory Theatre. In the late 1970s, Light went through a real crisis after a period of not landing any parts. Broke, she almost quit acting, because she felt that she was not contributing to the theater.

In 1977, her agent phoned Light to have her audition for an understudy role in the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Not wanting to be attached to a soap opera or a sitcom she initially rejected the idea, until she was told her daily salary would be $350. At the audition she realized that &quot;the format reaches a lot of people&quot;. She could &quot;make a difference&quot; and &quot;make money&quot; at the same time. Instead of landing an understudy role, she was recast in the role of Karen Wolek, a role that had previously been portrayed by actresses Kathryn Breech and Julia Duffy. This role was quite lucrative for Light and spawned one of the show&#x27;s most-remembered storylines; Light&#x27;s character became an alcoholic prostitute after she became bored with her life as a housewife. On trial, Karen saved her friend Viki Lord Riley (Erika Slezak) from being convicted of killing Karen&#x27;s pimp, Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony) by admitting to the entire town, including her faithful husband, Dr Larry Wolek (Michael Storm), that she had been a prostitute.

Light&#x27;s portrayal of Karen brought the show critical acclaim and is credited with garnering &quot;One Life to Live&quot; ratings successes from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. Light&#x27;s dramatic, confessional courtroom performance of a housewife-turned-prostitute on the witness stand is regarded as one of the most memorable moments in television by &quot;TV Guide&quot;. In 1980, this won Light her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series; the scene in which she confessed her guilt in court is held in such high esteem that it is still used in acting classes. Light recalled: &quot;I was scared before those courtroom scenes. I was afraid to put myself out that much. With the agony of pulling it out piece by piece and having the prosecutor stick the knife in her gut, I couldn&#x27;t help but let everything spew out of her.&quot; Light won another Daytime Emmy Award in the role in 1981.

She appeared in an episode of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in its first season, called &quot;Dog Day Hospital&quot;, in which she played a housewife who became pregnant for the ninth time even though her husband claimed he had had a vasectomy. In an effort to punish the doctor who botched the job she took an operating room hostage though it was later revealed that her husband had not had the procedure.

=== Continued success and film expansion ===
After her success on daytime television, Light landed the leading role of assertive advertising executive Angela Bower on the ABC sitcom &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;. Co-starring Tony Danza, who played her housekeeper (and eventual boyfriend), the show ran for eight seasons from 1984 to 1992. The series was successful in the ratings, consistently ranked in the top ten in the final primetime ratings between the years of 1985 and 1989, and has since continued in syndication. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; as the 109th best sitcom of all time. Along with her work in &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?,&quot; she starred in several television films, including &quot;Stamp of a Killer&quot; (1987) alongside Jimmy Smits; and the critically acclaimed biographical drama &quot;The Ryan White Story&quot; (1989), in which she played the mother of HIV/AIDS positive teenager Ryan White. 
Light appeared in &quot;Wife, Mother, Murderer&quot; (1991), in which she played Audrey Marie Hilley. After &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?,&quot; Light starred in another ABC sitcom, &quot;Phenom&quot;, which ran for one season, 1993–94, before being canceled. In 1998 she starred in another short-lived sitcom, &quot;The Simple Life&quot; on CBS. She spent most of the 1990s starring in made-for-TV and feature films including &quot;Men Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Too Close to Home&quot;, which co-starred Ricky Schroder. In 1999, Light returned to the stage in the off-Broadway production of Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Wit&quot;. She earned strong reviews for her portrayal of Vivian Bearing, a university professor battling ovarian cancer, and reprised the role for the national tour. Light shaved her head for the role in the play.

Light returned to television with the recurring role of Judge Elizabeth Donnelly in the NBC legal crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in 2002. She appeared in 25 episodes of the series from 2002 to 2010. In 2004 she starred in another short-lived CBS sitcom, &quot;The Stones&quot;. In 2006, Light joined the cast of the ABC comedy-drama series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; as Claire Meade, the mother of Alexis and Daniel. She was a recurring guest-star during the first season and was promoted to series regular as of the second. Light appeared in the show until the series finale in 2010. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2007, and for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 2008, for her performance in show.

Light appeared in a number of films in the 2000s. She co-starred opposite Chris Messina and Jennifer Westfeldt in the 2006 romantic comedy film &quot;Ira &amp; Abby&quot;. In 2007, Light starred as a radical Christian woman in the independent film &quot;Save Me&quot;. Light&#x27;s character, Gayle, runs a Christian ministry known as Genesis House, which works to help gay men recover from their &#x27;affliction.&#x27; She is challenged by the arrival of Mark, an ill gay man who reminds Gayle of her dead, homosexual son, and the movie chronicles the challenges of the two as they learn to accept each other as they are.

=== Acclaim in theater and return to television ===
The New York Times said in 1999 of Light&#x27;s lead performance in the Broadway play Wit, &quot;It is the sort of transformational work that would hint at other future successes, with Shakespeare, maybe, if a full-time career in the theater were truly an option these days. In any event, it gives rise to a wish. Ms. Light, don&#x27;t touch that dial again, at least not for a while.&quot; Nevertheless, it would be another decade before Light returned to a major theatrical role on Broadway. From 2010 to 2011, Light appeared on Broadway as witty alcoholic Marie Lombardi in the play &quot;Lombardi&quot;, for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award, for Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Play. Another role on Broadway followed, as Silda Grauman in &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot; from 2011 to 2012, which garnered Light her first Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Play and the 2012 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play. Light also starred in two television pilots, ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Other People&#x27;s Kids&quot; and USA Network&#x27;s drama &quot;Eden&quot;, both in 2011 and neither of which were green-lit to continue.

Light appeared on Broadway as Faye in the 2013 play, &quot;The Assembled Parties&quot;, and won her second Tony Award for Featured Actress in a Play for her performance. In the same year, she joined the cast of TNT&#x27;s continuation of the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, in the role of Judith Brown Ryland, villainous mother of Harris Ryland (despite being only three years older than Mitch Pileggi who plays her TV son). She received positive reviews for her recurring role in &quot;Dallas&quot;, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; naming her the &quot;scene-stealer&quot; of the series.

In 2014, she was cast opposite Jeffrey Tambor in the critically acclaimed Amazon Studios dark comedy-drama series, &quot;Transparent&quot; created by Jill Soloway. She plays Shelly Pfefferman, ex-wife of the transgender character played by Tambor. The pilot episode debuted on February 6, 2014, and later episodes premiered on September 26, 2014. Light received Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film nominations for her performance.

Light appeared opposite Patricia Clarkson in the 2014 rom-com, &quot;Last Weekend&quot;, and as the mother of Melanie Lynskey&#x27;s character in a comedy-drama film, &quot;We&#x27;ll Never Have Paris&quot;, the same year. She returned to Broadway in 2015 as Madame Raquin in Helen Edmundson&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;, starring opposite Keira Knightley and Matt Ryan. In 2017, Light was featured in the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Working in the Theatre series on solo performance.

Light received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Marilyn Miglin in 2018&#x27;s &quot;The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,&quot; a mini-series on FX, culminating in a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. In 2019, Light guest-starred in the Netflix series, &quot;The Politician&quot;. Together with Bette Midler, she joined the main cast of the series for the second season, which premiered in June 2020. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on September 12, 2019.

In 2021, Light played Rosa Stevens in the biographical musical drama film &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda. She later starred in the comedy-thriller &quot;The Menu&quot;. She also was cast in the comedy-drama &quot;Down Low&quot;, and comedy-drama &quot;The Young Wife&quot; starring Kiersey Clemons. On television, Light played Courteney Cox&#x27;s mother in the Starz horror comedy series &quot;Shining Vale&quot;, and Blanche Knopf in the HBO Max series &quot;Julia&quot;, both having premiered in 2022.

==Personal life==
Light has been married to television actor Robert Desiderio since 1985. In 2010, the couple became bicoastal: she lives primarily in New York City, and he resides primarily in Southern California. She has a home in Beverly Hills, California and a home in Aspen, Colorado. She is Jewish and considers herself religious, without being attached to institutional religion. She has practiced Kundalini yoga for 20 years.

== Activism ==
After being inspired by the LGBTQ+ community, Light began advocating for people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s. She was one of the first celebrities to advocate against the social stigma encountered by LGBTQ+ people and those with AIDS. She has served on the boards of the Matthew Shepard Foundation and the Point Foundation, a support organization for students discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender.

Through her role in &quot;Transparent&quot; as the ex-wife of a transgender person, Light raises these issues to a broad audience. She reported &quot;It&#x27;s something that we really haven&#x27;t talked about before in pop culture, we haven&#x27;t talked about transgender issues, we haven&#x27;t talked about mature people&#x27;s sexuality.&quot;

In an interview with the magazine &quot;Out&quot;, Light stated:“It was the LGBTQ community that inspired me to be the kind of person I wanted to be. I wanted to be authentic and courageous, and for so long I wasn&#x27;t. When I began doing a lot of advocacy work in the early &#x27;80s for HIV and AIDS, I saw the community and the way the community was operating against all odds, against a world and a culture and country that gave them nothing and denigrated them. ... I looked at this community and said, &#x27;This is breathtaking. This is the kind of world and people I want to be around. These are the kind of people I want to be working with.&quot;In 2018, Light discussed the similarities between the beginnings of the LGBT rights movement and the Me Too movement.

In addition to LGBT and AIDS activism, she has spoken publicly to encourage vaccination against the flu as a way to protect vulnerable populations.

<doc id="419042" wikidata="Q804691" url="?curid=419042" title="Balboa Island, Newport Beach">
<text>Balboa Island is a harborside community in Newport Beach, California, accessible to the public via bridge, ferry and several public docks. The community is surrounded by a paved concrete boardwalk open to pedestrian traffic, designated as a public walking trail by the city.

Balboa Island&#x27;s Marine Avenue is home to local small businesses including restaurants, bakeries, fishing &amp; tackle, and local crafts. The island also has a fire station and a post office.

==Geography==
The Balboa Island community consists of three modified or artificial islands in Newport Harbor: Balboa Island (), the largest; the smaller Little Balboa Island () to the east of Balboa Island, joined by a two-lane bridge; and the smallest Collins Isle () to the northwest of Balboa Island, joined by a one-lane bridge. The Balboa Island community is joined to the mainland by a short two-lane bridge on the northeast of Balboa Island, and a privately operated fleet of three, three-car ferryboats (Balboa Island Ferry) which provide access across the harbor to the Balboa Peninsula which lies to the south.

== History ==

===Mudflat===
Originally, Balboa Island was little more than a mudflat surrounded by swampland. Today&#x27;s Newport Harbor emerged only after dredging millions of tons of silt. In the late 1860s, James McFadden and his brother, Robert, purchased a large portion of the future site of Newport, including the oceanfront of Newport Beach, much of Balboa Peninsula, and the sandbars that were to become Balboa Island and Newport Harbor&#x27;s other islands. They immediately began subdividing and selling their property.

They established a successful fishing wharf on the Balboa Peninsula and the townsite of Newport Beach. In the late 1860s, the bay was used as a landing to load hides, tallow, hay and other goods for export. In September 1870, Captain Samuel S. Dunnells’ steamer &quot;Vaquero&quot; ventured into the bay to offload a cargo of lumber and shingles. Captain Dunnells soon established “Newport Landing” by constructing a small wharf and warehouse near the west end of the present Coast Highway/Newport Bay Bridge.

The McFadden brothers acquired the landing in 1875 and for the next 19 years operated a thriving commercial trade and shipping business. However, the bay was not yet a true harbor and sand bars and a treacherous bay entrance caused the McFadden brothers to move the shipping business to the oceanfront by constructing a large pier on the sand spit that would become the Balboa Peninsula. The site was ideal because a submarine canyon (Newport Submarine Canyon - a favorite breeding ground for great white sharks), carved along with Newport Bay by the ancient Santa Ana River, provided calm waters close to the shore. McFadden Wharf was completed in 1888 and was connected by rail to Santa Ana in 1891. For the next eight years, the McFadden Wharf area was a booming commercial and shipping center and a company town began to grow. However, in 1899, the Federal Government allocated funds for major improvements to a new harbor at San Pedro, which would become Southern California’s major seaport. The McFadden Wharf and railroad was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad that same year, signaling the end of Newport Bay as a commercial shipping center.

In 1902, James McFadden sold all of his Newport property, including the Newport townsite, about half the Balboa Peninsula, and the swamplands that were to become Harbor, Lido, and Balboa Islands (totaling about ) to William Stepp &quot;WS&quot; Collins (WS Collins was also president of the Associated Oil Company) and C. A. Hanson for an undisclosed amount, suspected to be $50,000 with $5,000 down.

===Creation by dredging, 1906-1941===
Collins and Hanson saw Newport Bay’s resort and recreation potential. They took on Henry E. Huntington as a partner in the Newport Beach Company. Huntington had acquired the Pacific Electric railway system and used it to promote new communities outside of Los Angeles. In 1905, the Pacific Electric “Red Cars” were extended to Newport. By 1906, the Pacific Electric line Red Cars began servicing the Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Pavilion, and soon the Red Cars brought thousands of visitors from Los Angeles.

Collins built a dredge and, by 1906, began dredging a channel on the north side of the bay and depositing the sand and silt on tidelands that would become Balboa Isle.
Between 1902 and 1907, many of Newport Beaches’ waterfront communities were subdivided, including West Newport, East Newport, Bay Island, Balboa, and Balboa Isle. This established the grid system of small lots and narrow streets and alleys that still exists today.
Within a few years, real estate promoters began sending salesmen to Pasadena and to Los Angeles (both connected by the Red Cars) to promote property in and around Newport Harbor. Much Balboa Island property was sold in Pasadena, one of the reasons that many longtime Island residents have family and contacts in the Pasadena area.

In 1908 and 1909, with permission of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Collins moved his small dredge to the eastern part of the Newport bay, a mud flat called &quot;Snipe Island,&quot; and begin cutting a channel along the north side of the bay across from the Pavilion, piling the sand and silt up on the mud flat and thus Balboa Island was born.

As Balboa Isle began to take shape, Collins launched a national advertising campaign, offering 30 foot by 85 foot inland lots for $600 and waterfront lots for $750. He used a brochure picturing an elegant, but non-existing, hotel on the isle to help sell his lots. He also promised ferry service, electricity, paved streets, sewers, streetlights, and water. However, despite the advertisements, Collins originally sold lots on the Island for as little as $25.00, with promises that all streets, sewers and street lights would soon be installed and a bridge and ferry service to follow. Construction was begun for the ferry landing. Streets were staked out and lots were mapped. Even a few narrow sidewalks were built. A low wooden bulkhead was built along the south side of the island and an impromptu sewer system was laid out with pipes draining onto the beaches at their low tide levels to keep the discharge out of sight. He established the still-running Balboa Ferry.

Balboa isle owners struggled for years with poor roads, flimsy sidewalks, sewers that poured directly into the bay, and a wall so inadequate that homes were regularly flooded by high tides. By 1911, discouragement permeated the island, and owners left, tired of inadequate services. Neglected homes dotted the island, and lot prices fell to as little as $325. Still optimistic, Collins held an extravagant Fourth of July celebration in 1914. He distributed 8,000 brochures nationwide as well as promoting locally. He was successful, and thousands came to enjoy races, tours, food, and parades. Lots began selling again. Before long, Collins had sold 700 Balboa Island lots, establishing it as one of Newport Harbor&#x27;s favorite residential and recreational areas.

The island grew slowly at first, but in 1916, it became part of the City of Newport Beach. In 1918 the Balboa Island Improvement Association was started. The BIIA was a motivating force in working with the City on bulkhead repair, ferry service, a sewer system, water, gas, electricity, paved streets and sidewalks, and street lighting.

In those early days of 1919, water for the Island came from the famous &quot;Wooden Water Tower&quot; built on Agate Street, removed in 1929. In 1920, Park Avenue was the only paved road on the Island. People had outhouses behind their houses as there was no sewer, and some buried their trash in vacant lots. In 1920, a gas utility came to the Island providing heating, cooking, and lights.

Joseph Beek, while still a student at Pasadena City College, was enchanted with the area, and became one of Collins&#x27; salesmen. Beek played a crucial role in the development of Balboa Island, and spent a lifetime devoted to it. In 1919, Joe got the first contract for a ferry between the Island and Balboa Peninsula. In 1920, the first car was pushed across the bay (for 10 cents). In 1922, Joe Beek got a 15-year franchise, using the ferry boat &quot;Joker&quot;, which could hold two cars. That franchise has continued to this day, with three boats, named &quot;Admiral,&quot; &quot;Captain,&quot; and &quot;Commodore,&quot; that can each carry three vehicles. Beek later became Secretary of the California State Senate, where he served until his death in 1968.

By 1921, homes were beginning to fill in the Island and Balboa Peninsula. Roads to the Newport Harbor area were still largely undeveloped, and many people still arrived by rail to the peninsula and took the ferry over to the island. Although the first bridge from the mainland to the island&#x27;s North Bay Front was built in 1912, it was not capable of carrying automobiles until 1929, when it was refurbished.

The seawall was rebuilt in 1922. The Grand Canal wooden bulkhead and walk were rebuilt in concrete in 1929. The present day Bay Front bulkhead, walks and public piers were completed in 1938.

In 1924, the narrow bridge to Balboa Island was replaced with two lanes of wood. That bridge existed until 1928, when it was demolished to make way for a concrete bridge. Some of the wood from the old bridge was used to construct the building next to the &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; Restaurant (now Wilma&#x27;s Patio) on Marine Avenue. In 1929, a new concrete bridge was built and served for 51 years. The island&#x27;s population grew from a little over 100 in 1929 to today&#x27;s 4,500 in winter, and close to 10,000 summer renters. In 1981, the existing concrete bridge was replaced with a new, modern concrete structure with 9&#x27; wide walks.

===Jamboree Road, 1953===
The 1953 National Scout Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of America held its event where Newport Center and Fashion Island are now located. It was the third international jamboree, the first to be held west of the Mississippi River, and had 50,000 scouts from all 50 states and 16 foreign countries. Thousands of tents were pitched in the area accessible only by a muddy two-lane trail called Palisades Road. The road was soon paved, and later the name was changed to Jamboree Road in honor of the event. It remains a major thoroughfare through Newport Beach, ending at Balboa Island.

==21st century==
Balboa Island celebrated its centennial in 2016 with a parade.

According to the 2000 US Census, Balboa Island was one of the densest communities in Orange County. Approximately 3,000 residents live on just giving it a population density of 17,621 person per square mile—higher than that of San Francisco. Despite having some of the country&#x27;s most expensive homes, most of the dwellings are on small lots. A lot size on Balboa Island is x . In 2008 teardowns on interior lots of that size were going for $2,000,000. As times change some of the lots are being cobbled together into 1.5 or 2.0 sized lots for larger homes.

The perimeter of the island along the Bayfront is dotted with piers for the homeowners&#x27; boats. Marine Avenue and Agate Avenue form the commercial spine of the island.

Balboa Island has several associations. The Balboa Island Improvement Association, a voluntary group of people who live or work on Balboa Island; the Business Improvement District, a merchant-sponsored group on Marine Avenue; and the Little Balboa Island Association, a group of home owners only on Little Balboa Island. There is plenty of opportunity for community involvement on Balboa Island.

Balboa Island is one of the most expensive real estate markets in North America outside of Lower Manhattan. A two-bedroom house with a water view from the living room can cost about $3 million. Lot value is $2 million. Interior new construction sells for $4 million. Bayfronts range from $3.5 million to $9 million.
Balboa Island&#x27;s only bar, the Village Inn (or VI, as locals like to call it), has sat near the end of Marine Ave for more than 80 years.

==In popular culture==

The 1949 film noir &quot;The Reckless Moment&quot;, directed by Max Ophüls, is primarily set on Balboa Island, a change from the Elizabeth Sanxay Holding novel that the film was based on.

In &quot;The Girl Most Likely&quot;, a 1958 RKO musical, the main character Dodie, played by Jane Powell, lives on Balboa Island and travels by ferry to her job on the mainland.

The sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; is partially set on Balboa Island, where the family-owned frozen banana stand is located.

The 2000 film &quot;Time Share&quot; is set on Balboa Island.

In the Netflix series &quot;Dirty John&quot; the two main characters lease a waterfront property together on Balboa Island after dating for only five weeks.

In the indie game &quot;Raft&quot;, the player travels to Balboa Island to gather materials and weapons.

<text>The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy () is a human rights organization based in Hong Kong that provides information human rights abuses in mainland China for news outlets. It is run single-handedly by Frank Lu Siqing.

A municipal court document obtained by Lu claims his information center was &quot;registered in Hong Kong by foreign hostile element Frank Lu Siqing.&quot;

Lu may be able to continue his operations legally as Hong Kong is governed under the one country, two systems policy.

Lu has been imprisoned in mainland China twice, first in 1981 for calling for freedom of speech and again in 1989 for supporting the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.

Bredesen was born in Oceanport, New Jersey, the son of Norma Lucille (Walborn) and Philip Norman Bredesen. His parents divorced and his mother was employed as a bank teller. During Bredesen&#x27;s childhood, his grandmother, who sewed for a living, lived with the family. Bredesen grew up in Shortsville, New York, 30 miles from Rochester. He attended Red Jacket Central Elementary and Secondary School in the adjoining village of Manchester.

He received a scholarship to Harvard University, where he graduated with an undergraduate degree in physics. In 1967, Bredesen moved to Lexington, Massachusetts, where he did classified work for Itek and received a draft deferment during the Vietnam War.
In 1968, Bredesen worked for the campaign of Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, who was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Bredesen launched his first political campaign in 1969, when he ran for the Massachusetts State Senate. He was defeated by a popular incumbent Republican, Ronald MacKenzie.

Bredesen joined pharmaceutical firm G.D. Searle &amp; Company in 1971, and moved to London in 1973 to manage one of the company&#x27;s divisions. In 1974, he married Andrea Conte. In 1975, the family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where Conte had been recruited by Hospital Corporation of America. In Nashville, Bredesen founded HealthAmerica Corp., an insurance company. He sold his controlling interest in HealthAmerica in 1986, and because of the wealth he earned from the company, did not accept his gubernatorial salary.

==Political involvement==
===Mayor of Nashville===

In 1987, Bredesen ran for mayor of Nashville. He finished second out of 10 candidates with 30% of the vote, behind only 5th District Congressman Bill Boner, who won 46%. Since Boner fell short of the necessary threshold for an outright victory, he and Bredesen faced each other in a runoff. Boner won the runoff, 75,790 votes to 66,153, largely by emphasizing that he was a Nashville native while Bredesen was a Northerner.

In December 1987, Bredesen ran in the Democratic primary for the 5th District congressional seat left open by Boner&#x27;s victory. He finished a distant second behind Bob Clement, son of former governor Frank G. Clement.

Ahead of the 1991 mayoral race, Boner was accused of marital infidelity, and declined to run. Bredesen won the election, defeating Councilwoman Betty Nixon, 78,896 votes to 30,282.

As mayor of Nashville, Bredesen added more than 440 new teachers, built 32 new schools and renovated 43 others. He also implemented a back-to-basics curriculum to teach students the fundamentals of learning. Under the Bredesen Administration, the NFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers (now Tennessee Titans) were brought to Nashville and furnished with a new stadium, Nissan Stadium; the NHL awarded Nashville its first of four new expansion franchises, the Nashville Predators; and Bridgestone Arena was built. Bredesen also attempted to lure the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves and later the NHL&#x27;s New Jersey Devils to Nashville, but both efforts were unsuccessful. A new downtown library was built as a cornerstone of major improvements to the entire library system, the city&#x27;s downtown entertainment district was renovated, and two parks, Beaman Park and Shelby Bottoms, were established.

Bredesen did not run for a third term in 1999. The Metro Charter had been amended in 1994 to limit city council members to two consecutive four-year terms, and was worded in such a way that it appeared to apply to mayors as well. Although mayors had been permitted to serve a maximum of three consecutive terms since the formation of Metro Nashville in 1963, Bredesen did not make an issue of that.

===Governor of Tennessee===
Bredesen declared his candidacy for the 1994 Tennessee gubernatorial election in November 1993. He won the Democratic nomination for governor, capturing 53% of the vote in a primary that included more than a half-dozen candidates, among them Shelby County Mayor Bill Morris and state senator Steve Cohen. In the November general election, Bredesen was defeated by the Republican nominee, 7th district U.S. Representative Don Sundquist, 807,104 votes to 664,252.

Bredesen ran for governor of Tennessee again in 2002. He easily won the Democratic nomination, capturing nearly 80% of the vote in a six-candidate primary, and faced Republican 4th district U.S. Representative Van Hilleary in November (the incumbent, Sundquist, was term-limited). Bredesen promised to manage state government better, improve Tennessee&#x27;s schools and use his experience as a managed-care executive to fix TennCare, which had created a critical budget shortfall toward the end of Sundquist&#x27;s term. His reputation as a moderate Democrat was well established (he is a member of the &quot;good government&quot; faction of the Nashville Democratic Party), so Hilleary&#x27;s attempts to brand him as a liberal ultimately failed. Republicans also suffered from Sundquist&#x27;s unpopular attempts to implement a state income tax. Bredesen garnered more support in East Tennessee than was usual for a Democrat, especially one from Nashville. In November, Bredesen narrowly defeated Hilleary, 837,284 votes to 786,803.

====First term====

Bredesen became governor amid a fiscal crisis, with a predicted state budget shortfall of $800 million. Much of the shortfall was due to TennCare, which was $650 million over budget. Sundquist had hoped to remedy the budget shortfall by implementing an income tax, but this proved wildly unpopular and was never enacted. Bredesen argued that services would have to be cut, saying, &quot;you can&#x27;t have Massachusetts services and Tennessee taxes.&quot; In 2003, he signed a 9% across-the-board spending cut. In 2004, he enacted a series of changes to TennCare, essentially removing 191,000 Medicaid-eligible patients and reducing benefits. By 2006, these changes had reduced the program&#x27;s cost by more than $500 million. Bredesen used some of the savings to establish a &quot;safety net&quot; for health clinics affected by the cuts. In 2006, he implemented &quot;Cover Tennessee&quot; to cover people with preexisting conditions and the uninsured.

During his first term, Bredesen enacted a number of measures aimed at improving education. In 2003, the state established the Tennessee Lottery to fund college scholarships for the state&#x27;s high school graduates. Teachers&#x27; pay was raised above the average salary in the Southeast, and Tennessee&#x27;s pre-kindergarten initiative was expanded to include a statewide program for four-year-olds. Bredesen created the Governor&#x27;s Books from Birth Foundation, a statewide expansion of Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library that offers free books for children, and in his fourth year, he signed legislation that increased funding for education by $366.5 million, much of which came from savings due to TennCare reform.

To attract new industry, Bredesen worked with the General Assembly to reform Tennessee&#x27;s worker compensation system (changes supported by the business community and opposed by trial lawyers), and invest in programs to help laid-off employees develop new skills. During his tenure, 2,889 companies, including Nissan and International Paper, expanded or moved to Tennessee, bringing more than 104,000 jobs and $12.8 billion in new business investment to the state.

Bredesen launched a war on methamphetamine abuse, focusing on treatment, prevention and public awareness, with the Governor&#x27;s Meth-Free Tennessee initiative. Criminal penalties and resources for law enforcement were also enhanced as part of this program, which led to a 50% decline in illegal and toxic meth labs. In 2005, Bredesen signed legislation establishing the Tennessee Heritage Conservation Trust Fund, which increased the state&#x27;s land-buying power in hopes of protecting ecologically significant land and conserving or restoring historically significant areas.

In his 2006 reelection campaign, Bredesen brushed off a primary challenge from John Jay Hooker, winning nearly 90% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated State Senator Jim Bryson, 1,247,491 votes to 540,853, sweeping all 95 counties and garnering more votes than any gubernatorial candidate in state history.

====Second term====
In 2007, Bredesen was criticized for proposing a private donation funded $4.8 million dining room upgrade to entertain lawmakers and other dignitaries to the Tennessee Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Critics labelled the proposed complex &quot;Bredesen&#x27;s Bunker,&quot; and derided it as too elaborate and expensive.

In August 2008, Bredesen enacted further cuts to TennCare, placing restrictions on services to 10,800 TennCare patients who received some type of home nursing care. The new limits affected about 1,000 of those patients.

In the 2008 elections, Republicans gained control of both chambers of the General Assembly for the first time since Reconstruction. The onset of the Great Recession also limited what Bredesen could accomplish during his remaining years in office. In 2009, he called for nearly $129 million in state spending cuts and enacted a voluntary buyout for state employees that reduced the workforce by 5% without requiring layoffs. In April 2009, Bredesen signed a bill into law which eliminated thumbprint requirements for gun purchases. In May 2009, Bredesen vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to carry guns in bars, but the legislature overrode his veto. In June 2009, Bredesen signed a bill into law allowing loaded guns in cars.

==Post-governorship==
Since leaving the governor&#x27;s office in 2011, Bredesen has been the chairman of a solar energy plant developer.

Viewed by many as a moderate Democrat based in the South, Bredesen was touted as a potential presidential candidate in 2008, but he said he had no interest in joining the wide field of Democrats seeking the nomination. He did not comment on joining a Democratic ticket as Vice President of the United States. On June 4, 2008, Bredesen endorsed Barack Obama for U.S. president. Following the withdrawal of former Senator Tom Daschle as nominee for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama Administration, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; correspondent Marc Ambinder reported that Bredesen was being vetted as a possible replacement. Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius was eventually chosen for the post.

== 2018 U.S. Senate campaign ==

On September 26, 2017, incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Bob Corker announced he would not seek reelection in 2018. On December 6, 2017, Bredesen announced that he would run for Corker&#x27;s open seat. Bredesen won the Democratic primary on August 2, 2018, with 348,302 votes (91.50%). Marsha Blackburn won the Republican primary on the same day.

In April 2018, Corker said that Bredesen was &quot;a very good mayor, a very good governor, a very good business person&quot; with &quot;real appeal&quot; and &quot;crossover appeal&quot;, and that the two of them had cooperated well over the years, but that he would vote for Blackburn and contribute to her campaign. Corker said that he would not campaign against Bredesen. After Corker&#x27;s praise for Bredesen, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned Corker that such comments could cost the Republican Party its Senate majority. Shortly after Corker&#x27;s comments, President Donald Trump tweeted an endorsement of Marsha Blackburn, who was running for the Republican nomination in the Senate race. During the campaign, Trump attacked Bredesen.

According to &quot;Politico&quot;, Bredesen represents a &quot;center-right coalition&quot; including &quot;Chamber of Commerce-type Republicans.&quot; During the campaign, Bredesen said that he opposed Trump&#x27;s tariff policy, saying that the tariffs amounted to a tax on Tennesseans and &quot;they will drive up prices, hurt our economy and will cost jobs, especially in our important automotive sector&quot;. Bredesen praised Corker for publicly opposing Trump&#x27;s tariff policy.

In October 2018, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift endorsed Bredesen. The endorsement was notable because Swift had never been publicly political before. She said Blackburn&#x27;s &quot;voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me&quot; and shared a link to the nonpartisan voter registration website Vote.org, which saw a significant spike in page views and new registrations.

Blackburn defeated Bredesen in the November 6 election. Although polls showed the race to be close for much of the cycle, Blackburn pulled ahead after the confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which are believed to have mobilized Republican voters. In the general election, Bredesen lost by just under 11 points, taking 43.9 percent of the vote to Blackburn&#x27;s 54.7 percent. He carried only three counties — Davidson, Shelby and Haywood. The race was called for Blackburn less than half an hour after the polls closed.

==Political positions==
Bredesen has been described as a moderate Democrat. According to &quot;The Tennessean,&quot; he is a &quot;political moderate&quot;, &quot;known for his middle-of-the-road, fiscally conservative politics&quot; and has &quot;occasionally irritated liberals in his party&quot;. On The Issues, a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that examines politicians&#x27; records and statements, identifies Bredesen as a &quot;moderate populist conservative&quot;. According to the &quot;Political Encyclopedia of U.S. States and Regions&quot;, Bredesen has embraced both fiscal conservatism and social liberalism &quot;in a way that has a broad appeal to voters across the political spectrum&quot;. In his 2018 Senate campaign, Bredesen ran on a moderate platform.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Bredesen&#x27;s 2018 campaign that &quot;in an indication of how precarious it can be to run statewide as a Democrat in the South, he also made no mention of his party and did not refer to President Trump by name.&quot;

=== Social issues ===
Bredesen has said the Affordable Care Act &quot;needs fixing.&quot; In 2018, he said, &quot;I was not a fan of the Affordable Care Act but when it passed, I said, &#x27;it&#x27;s the law of the land, let&#x27;s make it work.&#x27;&quot;

Bredesen is pro-choice on abortion. He supports legal access to abortion, but does not consider it a defining issue of his platform. He supported a state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in 2006, but supported the right of same-sex couples to adopt children. He supports non-discrimination protections for same-sex couples. Bredesen is a supporter of capital punishment.

Bredesen had an A rating from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) as governor, but in 2018, the NRA gave him a D rating. During his Senate campaign, he has expressed his support for the 2nd Amendment and described himself as a gun owner. His campaign disagrees with the D rating and has responded that Bredesen &quot;agrees with 80-plus percent of NRA&#x27;s positions [but] differs, for example, by supporting gun show background checks.&quot; In the wake of the February 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Bredesen called for universal background checks for gun purchases (including those made at gun shows), tighter checks for mental illness, and a ban on bump stocks. As governor, he vetoed bills to allow guns in bars or restaurants that serve alcohol. He also signed into law a bill allowing gun owners with handgun permits to carry their firearms in public parks. In 2009, Bredesen said he would not veto a bill exempting certain firearms from federal regulations, allowing the bill to become law without his signature, but he had vetoed a similar bill earlier (his veto was overridden).

Regarding immigration issues, Bredesen has taken positions that are commonly associated with both parties. In 2004, Bredesen introduced a bill to &quot;end the practice of issuing state drivers&#x27; licenses to undocumented persons.&quot; He supports DACA for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.

=== Judicial nominees ===
In October 2018, Bredesen broke with the Democratic Party and endorsed the confirmation of Trump&#x27;s second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. The endorsement came the day before the final confirmation vote on the nomination.

=== Economic and fiscal issues ===
On fiscal issues, Bredesen leans conservative. He ran for governor opposing the state income tax and as governor made cuts to the state&#x27;s government health care plan due to its financial trouble. Bredesen opposed the Republican Party&#x27;s 2017 tax reform, saying it provided &quot;crumbs&quot; to the middle class. As governor, he proposed increasing taxes on cigarettes. In 2007, he expressed uncertainty about the Bush tax cuts stating they would not help everyone. He also sought to eliminate the grocery tax break arguing that funding was needed for the state&#x27;s budget. He did not raise the sales tax and opposed raising taxes on gas, but did support increasing a tax on cable services. He supports an increase in the minimum wage.

==Personal life==
Bredesen married Susan Cleaves in 1968. They divorced in 1974 and had no children. Later that year, he married Andrea Conte in Wheatley, Oxfordshire, England. The two have one son, Ben. He identifies his faith as Presbyterian.

As of 2018, Bredesen&#x27;s net worth was estimated to be between $88.9 million and $358 million.

Bredesen is a founding member of the nonprofit Nashville&#x27;s Table and he served on the board of the Frist Center.

<text>Frank Steunenberg (August 8, 1861December 30, 1905) was the fourth governor of the State of Idaho, serving from 1897 until 1901. He was assassinated in 1905 by one-time union member Harry Orchard, who was also a paid informant for the Cripple Creek Mine Owners&#x27; Association. Orchard attempted to implicate leaders of the radical Western Federation of Miners in the assassination. The labor leaders were found not guilty in two trials, but Orchard spent the rest of his life in prison.

==Early career==
Born in Keokuk, Iowa, and raised in Knoxville, Steunenberg was the fourth of 10 children of Bernardus and Cornelia (Keppel) Steunenberg, with five brothers and four sisters. He attended Iowa State College at Ames and then went on to become a printer&#x27;s apprentice and publisher. In 1881, he was hired by the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; in Des Moines. Steunenberg later published a newspaper in Knoxville until 1886, when he moved west and settled in Caldwell, Idaho Territory, where he joined his younger brother Albert K. Steunenberg (1863–1907) in taking over the &quot;Caldwell Tribune&quot; for six years.

Steunenberg became active in politics as a member of the 1889 Idaho Constitutional Convention which led to Idaho&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1890. In 1890, he was elected to the Idaho House of Representatives as a fusion candidate, endorsed by both the Democratic and Populist Parties, and he served one term. In addition, he served for several years as chairman of the Caldwell town council.

==Governor==

With labor union support, in 1896 Steunenberg was nominated as both the Democratic and Populist candidate for governor. He won the November election at age 35 (the youngest in the states history) and became the first non-Republican elected to that office and was re-elected to a second two-year term in 1898. Steunenberg served during a period of considerable labor unrest, particularly in the mining industry in northern Idaho. As a result, many corporations, fearing that Steunenberg&#x27;s government would not support them if there was a strike, increased their wages for workers.

The Bunker Hill Mining Company, however, hired only non-union labor and kept wages lower than unionized mines in the area. In April 1899, members of the Western Federation of Miners destroyed the company&#x27;s mill at Wardner in the Silver Valley. In response, Steunenberg declared martial law and because the national guard was deployed to the Philippines due to the Spanish–American War of the preceding year, Steunenberg asked President William McKinley to send federal troops to quell the unrest. This action was seen as a betrayal by Steunenberg&#x27;s union supporters. Martial law remained in place through the end of his term, and Steunenberg did not seek a third term in 1900.

==Assassination==
Nearly five years after he left office, Steunenberg was killed outside his house in Caldwell at 1602 Dearborn Street () by a bomb rigged to the side gate on 16th Avenue. Harry Orchard, a former miner from the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), was arrested in Caldwell shortly after for the assassination, and the investigation was conducted by Pinkerton agent James McParland. Orchard at first claimed innocence, but after solitary confinement and intense interrogation by McParland, Orchard signed a 64-page type-written confession detailing years of being a paid assassin and dynamiter for the WFM. Orchard claimed he was hired to kill Steunenberg by leadership of the WFM, and he had been in previous jobs that resulted in at least 17 other deaths. Orchard said his orders for the killing of Steunenberg came from &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood, general secretary of the WFM, Charles Moyer, president of the WFM, and George Pettibone, a labor activist who had a prior conviction related to an 1892 labor dispute in Coeur d&#x27;Alene. At McParland&#x27;s urging, the three were arrested in Denver in February 1908, and hurriedly extradited to Idaho for trial.

The nationally publicized trial took place in Boise over several months in mid-1907 and included new U.S. Senator William Borah for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense. On the witness stand, Orchard repeated his written confession, admitting to years of setting bombs for the WFM. He was then cross-examined by defense lawyers for 26 hours, spread out over a week&#x27;s time. In addition to Orchard, the prosecution presented 80 more witnesses to corroborate Orchard&#x27;s description of numerous attacks. Darrow and the defense team called over 100 witnesses of their own. Closing arguments lasted two weeks, the most talked about of which was by Darrow. Modern commentators have praised Darrow&#x27;s closing argument, which used powerful emotional rhetoric focused on the moral superiority of the unions&#x27; position. However, contemporary reaction was universally negative. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;the most unseemly, abusive, inflammatory speech ever delivered in an American courtroom.&quot; Despite most observers&#x27; opinions that the verdict would be guilty, the jury returned an acquittal for Haywood in late July. Pettibone was defended in a separate trial by Judge Orrin N. Hilton of Denver and was also acquitted, and charges were dropped against Moyer.

Orchard pleaded guilty and received a death sentence in a separate trial, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison. In 1952, at 86 years of age and 45 years after the Haywood trial, Orchard wrote in his autobiography that all of his confession and his trial testimony were true. He died in prison in 1954.

==Legacy==
At the request of the Steunenberg family, attorney Borah gave a brief oration at the funeral in Caldwell on January 2, 1906.

A monument to Steunenberg was dedicated in December 1927 in Boise; the outdoor bronze statue faces the front steps of the Idaho State Capitol from across Jefferson Street. Its inscription is as follows:

Frank Steunenberg&lt;br&gt;
Governor of Idaho&lt;br&gt;
1897 – 1900&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

When in 1899 organized lawlessness challenged the power of Idaho, he upheld the dignity of the state, enforced its authority and restored LAW AND ORDER within its boundaries, for which he was assassinated in 1905.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Rugged in body, resolute in mind, massive in the strength of his convictions, he was of the granite hewn.&quot; In grateful memory of his courageous devotion to public duty, the people of Idaho have erected this monument.

The quote is from Borah&#x27;s oration at the funeral in 1906.

<doc id="419056" wikidata="Q869106" url="?curid=419056" title="EA Sports">
<text>EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they imitated real-life sports networks by calling themselves the &quot;EA Sports Network&quot; (EASN) with pictures or endorsements, it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as &quot;EA Sports FC&quot;, &quot;PGA Tour&quot;, &quot;NHL&quot;, &quot;NBA Live&quot;, and &quot;Madden NFL&quot;.

Most games under this brand are developed by EA Vancouver, the Electronic Arts studio in Burnaby, British Columbia as well as EA Orlando (formerly Tiburon Studios) in Orlando, Florida. The main rival to EA Sports is 2K Sports. Notably, until 2018, both companies competed over the realm of NBA games, with 2K releasing the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series. Konami is its rival in association football games with their own series, &quot;eFootball&quot;.

For several years after the brand was created, all EA Sports games began with a stylized five-second video introducing the brand with Andrew Anthony voicing its motto, &quot;It&#x27;s in the game&quot;, meaning that its games aimed at simulating the actual sports as authentically and completely as possible; Anthony was never compensated for his appearance and did it merely as a favour to a friend.

Unlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the best-selling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL 98&quot;, &quot;NBA Live 98&quot;, and &quot;NHL 98&quot; were released for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES throughout 1997; &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot; and &quot;FIFA 2005&quot; had PlayStation releases in 2004 (&quot;FIFA 2005&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot; were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released); and &quot;NCAA Football 08&quot; had an Xbox release in 2007. &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot; also had Xbox and GameCube releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2003&quot; and &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2004&quot; were released not only for the PlayStation 2, but for the original PlayStation as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English Football League Two team Swindon Town F.C. from the 2009–10 season onward and the EA Sports Cup in the Republic of Ireland. In July 2021, hackers who breached Electronic Arts in June 2021, have released the entire cache of stolen data after failing to extort the company and later sell the stolen files to a third-party buyer. Prior to the start of the 2023–24 season, EA Sports signed with the Spanish football league association, Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional to sponsor both first and second tier competitions which were under the title name, &quot;LaLiga EA Sports&quot; and &quot;LaLiga Hypermotion&quot; for five seasons with the €30 million a year deal.

In June 2023, EA announced a restructuring of the company, having EA Entertainment and EA Sports as two separate divisions inside the business, with Cam Weber becoming the president of the division.

== History ==
=== Exclusivity deals ===
In 2003, EA purchased the license to NASCAR for six years, ending competition from Papyrus and Infogrames. The NASCAR license expired in 2009 and the NASCAR license would be owned by Polyphony Digital for the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series starting with &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;, and also Eutechnyx for &quot;NASCAR The Game&quot; series from 2011 to 2015.

On December 13, 2004, EA Sports signed an exclusive deal with the National Football League (NFL) and its Players&#x27; Union for five years. On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the 2012 NFL season.

Less than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal on January 11, 2005, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the Arena Football League (AFL).

On April 11, 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.

EA lost the rights for Major League Baseball (MLB) games to 2K Sports in 2005, ending EA&#x27;s MVP series; however, EA made NCAA Baseball games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license.

In January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluated the status of their MVP game engine.

In 2005, EA Sports and ESPN signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from Sega and 2K. EA&#x27;s use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA&#x27;s early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;).

The federal district case &quot;O&#x27;Bannon v. NCAA&quot;, decided in 2014, involved the rights of college athletes to be able to control their likelinesses in downstream products from NCAA properties. The case specifically concerned EA&#x27;s &quot;NCAA Basketball 09&quot; when it was first filed in 2009, leading EA to abandon the &quot;NCAA Basketball&quot; line that year. The case was ruled in favor of the college athletes, which made licensing of these for EA&#x27;s games more difficult. While EA had continued the &quot;NCAA Football&quot; series, the NCAA terminated its license agreement with EA in 2013 due to several factors, including the &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; case as well as issues over comparable licensing fees to the professional sports games.

On June 4, 2012, EA signed a &quot;multi-year, multi-product&quot; partnership with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, taking over from THQ.

Following the release of &quot;Rory McIlroy PGA Tour&quot; in 2015, EA Sports announced that they would end its PGA Tour series after 25 years, with the said game was pulled from digital storefronts in May 2018. 2K Sports announced that they would assume their licensing agreement with the PGA Tour beginning with the release of &quot;The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour&quot; in 2018.

The NFL, the NFL&#x27;s Players&#x27; Association, and EA confirmed its exclusivity contract for NFL sports simulation games in May 2020, lasting through at the 2025–2026 NFL season with an optional one-year extension. The new contract allows EA to develop NFL games outside of the typical &quot;EA Madden&quot; titles, including for mobile games.

In February 2021, EA announced it was returning to college sports with a &quot;EA College Football&quot; game to be released within the next couple of years. As planned, the game will not use any player likenesses, but instead bypasses the issues with the NCAA by licensing all other branding related to college football such as team names, uniforms, and stadiums through the Collegiate Licensing Company, as at the time of the announcement, the NCAA had not yet reached definitive rules on appropriate payment to players for their likeliness. If such rules are established by the time of the game&#x27;s release, EA said they would then include player likenesses. However, Notre Dame stated that until such rules are in place, they declined to be part of EA&#x27;s game. At the time of this announcement, EA stated they had no other agreements with other NCAA sports. Later that month, EA purchased Codemasters, developers of the &quot;F1&quot; series, therefore reclaiming the rights to publish F1 games.

EA acquired Metalhead Software in May 2021, the developers of the &quot;Super Mega Baseball&quot; series. EA stated that they are looking to taking the core aspects of that series to integrate with licensing from MLB to publish a licensed baseball game again in the future.

EA has had deals with FIFA to use the FIFA name and branding for its &quot;EA FIFA&quot; series, in additional to over 300 separate deals with the leagues and teams for their names, logos, and player likeness rights. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in October 2021, FIFA had started discussions with EA in the prior two years on renewing these rights towards an exclusivity deal but with several caveats that has made negotiations difficult. Among FIFA&#x27;s requests was increasing the exclusive license fee to over each four-year period between FIFA World Cups, and limiting the scope of this exclusivity to association football simulation games, while EA wanted to expand the branding into new video game ventures such as esports using the game, an area that FIFA wanted to either keep to themselves or license to other developers to expand their own revenues. FIFA issued a statement following this report that stated they had reached an impasse with EA on the negotiations. FIFA&#x27;s position was that it has &quot;a duty to support its 211 member associations to fully capitalise on the inherent opportunities that have been emerging over the recent years. As part of this strategy, FIFA also commits to continuing to organise skill-based eSports tournaments under the umbrella of the recently launched FIFAe competition structure and consumer brand.&quot; To that end, FIFA believed it was necessary that any license agreement &quot;must involve more than one party controlling and exploiting all rights&quot;. EA has considered that abandoning the FIFA name would have little impact on the player experience since the league and team licenses would be unaffected. EA had trademarked &quot;EA Sports FC&quot; as a potential replacement name for the series. The last game released under the &quot;FIFA&quot; banner was 2022&#x27;s &quot;FIFA 23&quot;.

On March 2, 2022, EA, along with FIFA, NHL and the NHL Players&#x27; Association, the IIHF and F1 announced that they removed any of their names and logo licensing rights involving the Russian and Belarusian teams in both &quot;FIFA 22&quot; and &quot;NHL 22&quot;, citing the recent events related to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. The removals from both games also affected the development of &quot;F1 22&quot;; with Nikita Mazepin of the Haas F1 Team being replaced by Kevin Magnussen, the Russian Grand Prix being removed from the lineup, and the logos of Mazepin&#x27;s sponsor Uralkali being removed.

=== PC games ===
For the 2003 game year, and from years 2006 to 2008, EA published compilations of EA Sports titles for Windows called the &quot;EA Sports Collection&quot;; for example, the 2006 lineup was called the &quot;EA Sports 06 Collection&quot;.

In June 2009, EA Sports announced that for 2010, the games &quot;Madden NFL&quot;, &quot;NCAA Football&quot;, &quot;NASCAR&quot;, &quot;NHL&quot;, &quot;NBA Live&quot;, and &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour&quot; would not be shipped for PC platforms. The NCAA Football series had not been released on the PC since 1998, the &quot;Tiger Woods&quot; series&#x27; last PC game was &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08&quot;, the &quot;NASCAR&quot; series had not had a PC version since &quot;NASCAR SimRacing&quot; in 2005, and the last &quot;Madden&quot; series to be released on PC was &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;. The &quot;NHL&quot; series&#x27; last PC game was &quot;NHL 09&quot;. Likewise, &quot;NBA Live 08&quot; was the final PC version for &quot;NBA Live&quot;.

The head of EA Sports at that time, Peter Moore, cited piracy and the fact that the &quot;PC as a platform for authentic, licensed, simulation sports games has declined radically in the past three years as the next generation consoles [...] have attracted millions of consumers.&quot;

However, the &quot;FIFA&quot; series continues to be released on PC, and for the first time since 2008, &quot;Madden NFL 19&quot; was released for PC. Following EA&#x27;s purchase of Codemasters, the &quot;F1&quot; series would be published by EA on PC.

=== PlayStation Home ===

On April 23, 2009, EA Sports released the long-awaited &quot;EA Sports Complex&quot; space for the PlayStation 3&#x27;s online community-based service, PlayStation Home in the European and North American versions. In the Complex, users can play a series of mini-games, including poker, kart racing, golf, and it also features a Virtual EA Shop. There are also a number of advertisements for upcoming EA Sports games. Each mini-game that the Complex features has a reward or rewards. Heavy Water, a company dedicated to developing for Home, developed the EA Sports Complex for EA Sports.

Originally, the Complex just featured two rooms: the EA Sports Complex and the EA Sports Complex Upstairs. The EA Sports Complex featured racing and had a golfing range that was unavailable to play. The Upstairs had four poker tables that users could play at any time. With the June 18, 2009 update, the Complex&#x27;s name changed to the EA Sports Racing Complex and the Upstairs changed to the EA Sports Complex Green Poker Room. Other than the name change, the update took away the golfing range and added four more karts for users to play Racing at and it also added one red poker table to the poker room.

The July 2, 2009 update added golf and another poker room making four rooms for the Complex; the EA Sports Racing Complex, the EA Sports Golf Complex, the EA Sports Complex Green Poker Room, and the EA Sports Complex Red Poker Room. The Racing Complex features Racing with a total of eight karts; four on each side of the Complex. The Golf Complex features two Practice Ranges for golfing; one range on each side of the Complex. A Golf Pro-shop is coming soon for the Golf Complex. The Green Poker Room featured four green poker tables that users can play anytime. The Red Poker Room featured four red poker tables but requires users to have 2,000 points to play.

On July 16, 2009, EA Sports released another room for the Complex making five rooms for the Complex. This room is the game space for &quot;Fight Night Round 4&quot; called &quot;Club Fight Night&quot; featuring a mini-game called Club DJ and coming soon, robot boxing.

On July 30, 2009, EA Sports added a Black Poker Table to the EA Sports Complex Red Poker Room for the higher level players. In time, there will be a room dedicated for this table just like the Green Poker Room and the Red Poker Room. They also added a fifth green table to the Green Poker Room. The update also included the addition of the EA Sports Pro Shop where users can purchase full boxing outfits and furniture from &quot;Fight Night Round 4&quot;. The Pro Shop is found in the Racing Complex. The August 16, 2009 update replaced the fifth green table in the Green Poker Room with a red table. They also reduced the number of points for the Black Table from 20,000 to 10,000. The August 27, 2009 update separated the scoreboards for each level of play – Green, Red, and Black – and into Daily boards and Season boards (left side and right side), improved card readability, additional rail seating near the poker tables, player removal on lockup while playing poker, and player buy-in refund on removal (does not refund on Home disconnect) while playing poker.

On October 9, 2009, EA Sports released the EA Sports Complex to the Japanese version of Home. They also released NFL jerseys for every team in the league for purchase inside of the EA Sports Complex and in Home&#x27;s shopping complex. EA Sports have also teamed up with the Home team to produce and distribute exclusive virtual items that serve to support National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 100% of proceeds for these items went go to the Brees Dream Foundation in support of breast cancer research and awareness programs. The items are black jerseys with a pink number 9 on the front and the name Brees on the back also in pink. These jerseys were available from October 15, 2009, to November 25, 2009. On November 5, 2009, for those who purchased the Brees Breast Cancer jersey, they received a free DJ kit that is featured in the Club Fight Night space by entering one of the two EA Sports Complex poker rooms between November 5, 2009, and November 25, 2009. On November 25, 2009, &quot;Fight Night Round 4&quot; producers Mike Mahar and Brian Hayes were in Home between the hours of 4:00pm and 5:00pm PT (7:00pm and 8:00pm EST), for a live chat with the PlayStation Home community in one instance of the Club Fight Night space. On January 7, 2010, EA Sports released NCAA college football jerseys in the EA Sports Complex and in Home&#x27;s shopping complex.

On August 2, 2011, EA Sports launched the EA Sports Season Ticket subscription service. It was discontinued in 2015 and it was replaced with the similar EA Access service.

== Franchises ==

Most EA Sports games are distinguished by year, as most games are released on a yearly basis. Nevertheless, as EA Sports is the leading purchaser of official licenses, it is not uncommon that in a short span several games of the same sport but with different licenses are released: &quot;FIFA: Road to World Cup 98&quot; was shortly followed by &quot;World Cup 98&quot;, all in the wake of &quot;FIFA Soccer Manager&quot; in 1997 (as EA has owned the license for the FIFA World Cup, which happens regularly in four-year intervals, since 1998), and college football and basketball games are released that are based on Madden NFL and NBA Live, respectively.

<doc id="419058" wikidata="Q294281" url="?curid=419058" title="Al-Shafi'i">
<text>Al-Shafi&#x27;i (; ;767–820 CE) was an Arab Muslim scholar, jurist, traditionist, theologian, ascetic, and eponym of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence. He is known to be the first to write a book upon the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, having authored one of the earliest work on the subject: &quot;al-Risala&quot;. His legacy and teaching on the matter provided it with a systematic form, thereby &quot;fundamentally influenc[ing] the succeeding generations which are under his direct and obvious impact,&quot; and &quot;begin[ning] a new phase of the development of legal theory.&quot;

Being born in Gaza, Palestine, to the Banu Muttalib clan of the Quraysh tribe, he was relocated at the age of two and raised in Mecca. He later resided in Medina, Yemen, Baghdad in Iraq, and Egypt, and also served as a judge for some time in Najran.

==Introduction==
The biography of al-Shafi&#x27;i is difficult to trace. It was said Dawud al-Zahiri (d. 884 CE) was the first to write one, but the work has been lost. The oldest surviving biography goes back to Ibn Abi Hatim al-Razi (d. 938/939 CE), but is only a collection of anecdotes, some of them fantastical. Similarly, a biographical sketch written by Zakariyya ibn Yahya al-Saji was later reproduced, but even then, a great deal of legend had already crept into the story of al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s life. The first real biography was written by al-Bayhaqi (d. 1065/1066 CE), but is filled with what a modernist eye would qualify as pious legends. The following is what seems to be a sensible reading, according to a modern reductionist perspective.

==Biography==
===Ancestry===
Al-Shafi&#x27;i belonged to the Qurayshi clan of Banu Muttalib, which was the sister clan of the Banu Hashim, to which Muhammad and the Abbasid caliphs belonged. This lineage may have given him prestige, arising from his belonging to the tribe of Muhammad, and his great-grandfather&#x27;s kinship to him. However, he grew up in poverty, in spite of his connections to the highest social circles.

===Early life===
Born near the town of Ashkelon in 767/768 CE/150 AH. His father died in Sham while he was still a child. Fearing the waste of his sharif lineage, his mother decided to move to Mecca when he was about two years old. Furthermore, his maternal family roots were from Yemen, and there were more members of his family in Mecca, where his mother believed he would better be taken care of. Little is known about al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s early life in Mecca, except that he was brought up in poor circumstances and that from his youth he was devoted to learning. An account states that his mother could not afford to buy his paper, so he would write his lessons on bones, particularly shoulder-bones. He studied under Muslim ibn Khalid al-Zanji, the then-judge of Mecca, who is thus considered to be his first teacher. By the age of seven, al-Shafi&#x27;i had memorised the Quran. At ten, he had committed Malik ibn Anas&#x27;s &quot;Muwatta&quot; to heart, at which time his teacher would deputise him to teach in his absence. Al-Shafi&#x27;i was authorised to issue rulings at the age of fifteen.

===Apprenticeship under Malik ibn Anas===
Al-Shafi&#x27;i moved to Medina in desire for further legal training, as was the tradition of acquiring knowledge. Accounts differ on the age in which he set out to Medina; an account placed his age at thirteen, while another stated that he was in his twenties. There, he was taught for many years by the famous Malik ibn Anas, who was impressed with his memory, knowledge, and intelligence. By the time of Malik&#x27;s death in 179 AH (795 CE), al-Shafi&#x27;i had already gained a reputation as a brilliant jurist. Even though he would later disagree with some of the views of Malik, al-Shafi&#x27;i accorded the deepest respect to him by always referring to him as the &quot;Teacher&quot;.

===Yemeni &quot;Fitnah&quot;===
At the age of thirty, al-Shafi&#x27;i was appointed as the Abbasid governor in the Yemeni city of Najran. He proved to be a just administrator but soon became entangled with factional jealousies. In 803 CE, al-Shafi&#x27;i was accused of aiding the Alids in a revolt, and was thus summoned in chains with a number of Alids to the caliph Harun al-Rashid at Raqqa. Whilst other conspirators were put to death, al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s own eloquent defence convinced the caliph to dismiss the charge. Other accounts state that the famous Hanafi jurist, Muhammad al-Shaybani, was present at the court and defended al-Shafi&#x27;i as a well-known student of the sacred law. What was certain was that the incident brought al-Shafi&#x27;i in close contact with al-Shaybani, who would soon become his teacher. It was also postulated that this incident impelled him to devote the rest of his career to legal studies, never again to seek government service.

===Apprenticeship under al-Shaybani, and exposure to Hanafi jurists===
Al-Shafi&#x27;i traveled to Baghdad to study with Abu Hanifah&#x27;s acolyte al-Shaybani and others. It was here that he developed his first school, influenced by the teachings of both Abu Hanifah and Malik. His work thus became known as &quot;al-madhhab al-qadim li-l-imam al-shafi&#x27;i&quot;, or the &quot;old school of al-Shafi&#x27;i&quot;.

It was here that al-Shafi&#x27;i actively participated in legal arguments with the Hanafi jurists, strenuously defending the Maliki school of thought. Some authorities stress the difficulties encountered by him in his arguments. Al-Shafi&#x27;i eventually left Baghdad for Mecca in 804 CE, possibly because of complaints by Hanafi followers to al-Shaybani that al-Shafi&#x27;i had become somewhat critical of al-Shaybani&#x27;s position during their disputes. As a result, al-Shafi&#x27;i reportedly participated in a debate with al-Shaybani over their differences, though who won the debate is disputed.

In Mecca, al-Shafi&#x27;i began to lecture at the Sacred Mosque, leaving a deep impression on many students of jurisprudence, including the founder of the Hanbali school, Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s legal reasoning began to mature, as he started to appreciate the strength in the legal reasoning of the Hanafi jurists, and became aware of the weaknesses inherent in both the Maliki and Hanafi schools of thought.

===Departure to Baghdad and Egypt===
Al-Shafi&#x27;i eventually returned to Baghdad in 810 CE. By this time, his stature as a jurist had grown sufficiently to permit him to establish an independent line of legal speculation. The caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun is said to have offered al-Shafi&#x27;i a position as a judge, but he declined the offer.

====Connection with the family of Muhammad====
In 814 CE, al-Shafi&#x27;i decided to leave Baghdad for Egypt. The precise reasons for his departure from Iraq are uncertain, but it was in Egypt that he would meet another tutor, al-Sayyidah Nafisah, who would also financially support his studies, and where he would dictate his life&#x27;s works to students. Several of his leading disciples would write down what al-Shafi&#x27;i said, who would then have them read it back aloud so that corrections could be made. Al-Shafi&#x27;i biographers all agree the legacy of works under his name are the result of those sessions with his disciples.

Through Muhammad&#x27;s grandson Hasan ibn Ali, Nafisah was a descendant of Muhammad, and she married another descendant of Muhammad, Ishaq al-Mu&#x27;tamin. Ishaq was the son of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, a teacher of al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s teachers Malik ibn Anas, as well as Abu Hanifah. Thus, all of the four major imams of Sunni jurisprudence—Abu Hanifah, Malik, his student al-Shafi&#x27;i, and his student Ahmad—are connected to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, who was from the household of Muhammad, whether directly or indirectly.

===Death===
At least one authority states that al-Shafi&#x27;i died as a result of injuries sustained from an attack by supporters of a Maliki follower named Fityan. The story goes that al-Shafi&#x27;i triumphed in the argument over Fityan, who, being intemperate, resorted to abuse. The then-governor of Egypt, with whom al-Shafi&#x27;i had good relations, ordered Fityan punished by having him paraded through the streets of the city carrying a plank and stating the reason for his punishment. Fityan&#x27;s supporters were enraged by this treatment and attacked al-Shafi&#x27;i in retaliation after one of his lectures, causing him to die a few days later. However, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani casts doubt on this story, claiming it is not &quot;from a reliable source&quot;. Al-Shafi&#x27;i was also known to have suffered from a painful intestinal illness and hemorrhoids, which kept him frail and ailing during the later years of his life. Thus, the precise cause of his death is unknown.

Al-Shafi&#x27;i died at the age of 54 on 20 January 820 CE/30 Rajab 204 AH, in al-Fustat, Egypt. He was buried in the vault of the Banu Abd al-Hakam, near Mokattam. The &quot;dome&quot; was built in 1212 CE/608 AH by the Ayyubid sultan al-Kamil. Al-Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s mausoleum remains an important site today.

== Legacy ==

The Shafi&#x27;i school, one of the four Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence, known as madhhabs, is named for Al-Shāfi&#x27;ī, who is also credited setting up the framework of Islamic jurisprudence by establishing the relative importance order of its different sources as follows:
#The Qur&#x27;an;
#Hadith. i.e. collections of the words, actions, and silent approval of Muhammad. (Together with the Qur&#x27;an these make up &quot;revealed sources&quot;);
#Ijma. i.e. the consensus of the (pure traditional) Muslim community;
#Qiyas. i.e. the method of analogy.

Scholar John Burton goes farther, crediting Al-Shafi&#x27;i not just with establishing the science of fiqh in Islam, but its importance to the religion. &quot;Where his contemporaries and their predecessors had engaged in defining Islam as a social and historical phenomenon, Shafi&#x27;i sought to define a revealed Law.&quot;

Al-Shāfi‘ī emphasised the final authority of a hadith of Muhammad so that even the Qur&#x27;an was &quot;to be interpreted in the light of traditions (i.e. hadith), and not vice versa.&quot; While traditionally the Quran is considered above the Sunna in authority, Al-Shafi&#x27;i &quot;forcefully argued&quot; that the sunna stands &quot;on equal footing with the Quran&quot;, (according to scholar Daniel Brown) for – as Al-Shafi&#x27;i put it – &quot;the command of the Prophet is the command of Almighty Allah.&quot;

The focus by the Muslim community on ahadith of Muhammad and disinterest in ahadith of Muhammad&#x27;s companions (whose ahadith were commonly used before Al-Shāfi‘ī since most of whom survived him and spread his teachings after his death) is thought (by scholar Joseph Schacht) to reflect the success of Al-Shāfi‘ī&#x27;s doctrine.

Al-Shāfi‘ī influence was such that he changed the use of the term Sunnah, &quot;until it invariably meant only the Sunnah of the Prophet&quot; (according to John Burton this was his &quot;principle achievement&quot;). While earlier, sunnah had been used to refer to tribal manners and customs, (and while Al-Shāfi‘ī distinguished between the non-authoritative &quot;sunnah of the Muslims&quot; that was followed in practice, and the &quot;sunnah of the Prophet&quot; that Muslims &quot;should&quot; follow), sunnah came to mean the Sunnah of Muhammad.

In the Islamic sciences, Burton credits him with &quot;the imposition of a formal theoretical distinction&quot; between ‘the Sunnah of the Prophet’ and the Quran, &quot;especially where the two fundamental sources appeared to clash&quot;. 

; Mu&#x27;tazalites
Al-Shafi&#x27;i was part of those early traditionalist theologians who strongly opposed &quot;i&#x27;tizal&quot; and criticised the speculative theologians for abandoning the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;sunna&quot; through their adoption of Greek philosophy in metaphysics.

;Structures
Saladin built a &quot;madrasa&quot; and a shrine on the site of his tomb. Saladin&#x27;s brother Afdal built a mausoleum for him in 1211 after the defeat of the Fatimids. It remains a site where people petition for justice.
;Followers
Among the followers of Imam al-Shāfi‘ī&#x27;s school were:
*Bayhaqi
*Al-Suyuti
*Al-Dhahabi
*Al-Ghazali
*Ibn Hajar Asqalani
*Ibn Kathir
*Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi
*Al-Mawardi
* Al Muzani

=== Works ===
He authored more than 100 books, but few survived to this day. The extant works of his which are accessible today are:

*Al-Risala – The best-known book by al-Shafi&#x27;i in which he examined principles of jurisprudence. The book has been translated into English.
*Kitab al-Umm – his main surviving text on Shafi&#x27;i fiqh
*Musnad al-Shafi&#x27;i (on hadith) – it is available with arrangement, Arabic &#x27;Tartib&#x27;, by Ahmad ibn Abd ar-Rahman al-Banna
*Ikhtilaf al-Hadith
*Al-Sunan al-Ma’thour
*Jima’ al-’Ilm
In addition to this, al-Shafi&#x27;i was an eloquent poet, who composed many short poems aimed at addressing morals and behaviour. The most famous of which is his Al-Diwan.

=== Anecdotal stories ===
Ahmad ibn Hanbal considered al-Shafi&#x27;i to be the &quot;&quot;imam&quot; most faithful to tradition&quot; who led the people of tradition to victory against the exponents of &quot;ra&#x27;y&quot;. In the words of Ibn Hanbal, &quot;at no time was there anyone of importance in learning who erred less, and who followed more closely the sunnah of the Prophet than al-Shafi&#x27;i.&quot;

 stated: &quot;A &quot;mujaddid&quot; appears at the end of every century: the &quot;mujaddid&quot; of the 1st century was the &quot;imam&quot; of &quot;ahl al-sunna&quot;, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz; the &quot;mujaddid&quot; of the 2nd century was Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi&#x27;i; the &quot;mujaddid&quot; of the 3rd century was Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari; the &quot;mujaddid&quot; of the 4th century was al-Hakim al-Nishapuri.&quot;

=== Quotations ===
* He who seeks pearls immerses himself in the sea.
* He said to the effect that no knowledge of Islam can be gained from books of &quot;kalam&quot;, as it &quot;is not from knowledge&quot; and that &quot;it is better for a man to spend his whole life doing whatever Allah has prohibited—besides shirk with Allah—rather than spending his whole life involved in &quot;kalam&quot;.&quot;
* If a &quot;hadith&quot; is authenticated as coming from the Prophet, we have to resign ourselves to it, and your talk and the talk of others about why and how, is a mistake.

<text>Anytos or Anytus () was one of the Titans of Greek mythology. He was supposed to have raised Despoina, and in Arcadia during Pausanias&#x27; time the two were represented by statues in a temple near Acacesium.

== The Lycosoura Anytos (NAMA 1736) ==
The cult of Anytos is prominent in the city of Lycosura, home to the Temple of Despoina, a temple dedicated to the Chthonic pantheon consisting of Artemis, Demeter, and Despoina.

Currently housed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the bust of Anytos was discovered in excavations during the Summer of 1889.

Measuring 74 cm, the bust alongside the bust of Artemis and Demeter, was carved by the artist Damophon in 180 BC, is also considered an acrolith, a composite of many different materials with the head and limbs made of local marble, while the body portion made of wood.

Based upon the descriptions of the historian Pausanias in his text &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, written in the 2nd century, the statue of Artemis would stand alongside the statue of Demeter, while Anytos would stand right beside that of Despoina, dressed in warriors garb. The statue is the most fragmented out of those who exist on the pantheon but fragments of the god&#x27;s garb were found in addition to fragments of his limbs. The remnants has since then been part of the display at the National Archaeological Museum, under the designation NAMA 1736.

<doc id="419077" wikidata="Q190896" url="?curid=419077" title="Abu Hanifa">
<text>Abu Hanifa (; September 699–767) was a Muslim scholar, jurist, theologian, ascetic, and eponym of the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence, which remains the most widely practiced to this day. His school predominates in Central and South Asia, Turkey, the Balkans, Russia, and some parts of the Arab world.

Born to a Muslim family in Kufa, Abu Hanifa traveled to the Hejaz region of Arabia in his youth, where he studied in the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. He was named by al-Dhahabi as &quot;one of the geniuses of the sons of Adam&quot; who &quot;combined jurisprudence, worship, scrupulousness, and generosity&quot;.

As his career as a jurist and theologian progressed, he became known for favoring the use of reason in his jurisprudential rulings, and even in his theology. His school grew after his death, and the majority of its followers would also eventually come to follow the Maturidi school of theology. He left behind two major students, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad al-Shaybani, who would later become celebrated jurists in their own right.

==Name==
How Abu Hanifa earned his name is disputed. According to some linguists, including Muhyi al-Din, &quot;ḥanīfa&quot; refers to &quot;inkpot&quot; in Abu Hanifa&#x27;s dialect. He was often seen with one, thus earning his name this way. According to this interpretation, his name literally means the &quot;Father of the Inkpot&quot;.

However, some historians contest he earned it as he had a daughter named Hanifa. His name would then mean the &quot;Father of Hanifa&quot;. The opposing side believes he never had a daughter with such name.

==Biography==
===Family background===
Historians generally agree Abu Hanifa was born in Kufa during the period of the Umayyad Caliphate, but they differ regarding the year: 699 CE / 80 AH, 696 CE / 77 AH, 689 CE / 70 AH, or 680 CE / 61 AH. Many historians choose the latest date, 699 CE / 80 AH; however, Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari, adjunct to the office of the last Elder of Islam of the Ottoman Empire, believed the date of 689 CE / 70 AH is supported by two considerations. First, Muhammad ibn Makhlad al-Attar considered the narration of Abu Hanifa&#x27;s son, Hammad, from Malik ibn Anas to be an example of an older man&#x27;s narration rather than a younger man. Second, Abu Hanifa was concerned with who should succeed Ibrahim al-Nakha&#x27;i after his death in 96 AH. This concern would have only arisen if he was older than 19, since it is considered he only took his religious studies seriously after then. If Abu Hanifa was born in 80 AH, Abu Hanifa would have been 16 at the time of al-Nakhai&#x27;s death.

Abu Hanifa is thought to be of Persian ancestry. However, he has also been stated to have descended from the Zutt, Jats who migrated into Iraq during the Islamic Golden Age. His grandfather, Zuta, may have been captured by Muslim troops in Kabul and sold as a slave in Kufa, where he was purchased and freed by an Arab tribesman of the Taym Allah, a branch of the Banu Bakr. Zuta and his progeny thereafter would have become clients of the Taym Allah, hence the sporadic references to Abu Hanifa as &quot;al-Taymi&quot;. According to his grandson Isma&#x27;il, however, his lineage went back to free Persians who had never been held as slaves. He called Abu Hanifa&#x27;s great-grandfather &quot;Marzuban&quot;, which is an Arabicized form of the Sasanian military office of marzban, held by governors of the frontier provinces of the Sasanian realm.

===Early life and scholarship===
There is scant biographical information about Abu Hanifa. It is generally known that he worked a producer and seller of &quot;khazz&quot;, a type of silk clothing material. He attended lectures on jurisprudence conducted by the Kufan scholar Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman (d. 737). He also possibly learnt jurisprudence (fiqh) from the Meccan scholar Ata ibn Abi Rabah (d. ) while on pilgrimage.

When Hammad died, Abu Hanifa succeeded him as the principal authority on Islamic law in Kufa and the chief representative of the Kufan school of jurisprudence. Abu Hanifa gradually gained influence as an authority on legal questions, founding a moderate rationalist school of Islamic jurisprudence that was named after him.

===Adulthood and death===
In 763, al-Mansur, the Abbasid caliph offered Abu Hanifa the post of &quot;qadi al-qudat&quot; (chief judge of the state), but he declined the offer, choosing to remain independent. His student Abu Yusuf was later appointed to the post by Caliph Harun al-Rashid.

In his reply to al-Mansur, Abu Hanifa said that he was not fit for the post. Al-Mansur, who had his own ideas and reasons for offering the post accused Abu Hanifa of lying.

&quot;If I am lying,&quot; Abu Hanifa responded, &quot;then my statement is doubly correct. How can you appoint a liar to the exalted post of a &quot;qadi&quot;?&quot;

Incensed by this reply, al-Mansur had Abu Hanifa arrested, locked in prison and tortured. It was said that once in prison he was never fed nor cared for. Even in prison, the jurist continued to teach those who were permitted to visit him.

On 15 Rajab 150, (15 August 767) Abu Hanifa died in prison. The cause of his death is not clear, as it was said by some that Abu Hanifa issued a legal opinion for bearing arms against al-Mansur, so al-Mansur had him poisoned. His fellow prisoner and founder of Karaite Judaism, Anan ben David, was said to have received life-saving counsel from Abu Hanifa. It was said that so many people attended his funeral that the funeral service was repeated six times for the more than 50,000 people who had massed before he was actually buried. The historian al-Khatib said that for a full 20 days people performed funeral prayers for him. Many years later, the Abu Hanifa Mosque was built in the Adhamiyah neighbourhood of Baghdad. Abu Hanifa also supported the cause of Zayd ibn Ali and Ibrahim al Qamar, both Alid Zaydi Imams.

The structures of the tombs of Abu Hanifa and Abdul Qadir Gilani were destroyed by Shah Ismail of the Safavid Empire in 1508. In 1533, the Ottomans conquered Baghdad and rebuilt the tombs of Abu Hanifa and Abdul Qadir, as well as other Sunni sites.

== Sources and methodology ==
The sources from which Abu Hanifa derived Islamic law, in order of importance and preference, were: the Qur&#x27;an, the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet Muhammad (known as &quot;hadith&quot;), consensus of the Muslim community (&quot;ijma&#x27;&quot;), analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;), juristic discretion (&quot;istihsan&quot;) and the customs of the local population enacting Muslim laws (&quot;&#x27;urf&quot;). The development of analogical reason and the scope and boundaries by which it may be used was recognized by the majority of Muslim jurists, but its establishment as a legal tool was the result of the Hanafi school. While it was likely used by some of his teachers, Abu Hanifa is regarded by modern scholarship as the first to formally adopt and institute analogical reason as a part of Islamic law.

As the fourth Caliph, Ali had transferred the Islamic capital to Kufa, and many of the first generation of Muslims had settled there. The Hanafi school of law based many of its rulings on the prophetic tradition as transmitted by those first generation Muslims residing in Iraq. Thus, the Hanafi school came to be known as the Kufan or Iraqi school. Ali and Abdullah, son of Masud helped form much of the base of the school, as well as other personalities from the direct relatives (or ahl al-bayt) of Muḥammad from whom Abu Hanifa had studied such as Muhammad al-Baqir. Many jurists and historians had reportedly lived in Kufa, including one of Abu Hanifa&#x27;s main teachers, Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman.

==Reception==
=== Positive ===
He was highly regarded across the various fields of sacred knowledge and significantly influenced the development of Muslim theology. During his lifetime, he was acknowledged as a jurist of the highest calibre. The Shafi&#x27;i and prominent hadith scholar, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, stated that criticism of Abu Hanifa holds no significance, as figures like Abu Hanifa are &quot;on a degree to which Allah - the Exalted - has raised them, in that they are followed and imitated.&quot; 

Ibn Taymiyya credited Abu Hanifa for his knowledge and addressed the accusations against him, stating, “&quot;There is no doubt regarding Imam Abu Hanifa&#x27;s knowledge. People later attributed many lies to Imam Abu Hanifa, which were all untrue. The aim of such writings was to taint Imam Abu Hanifa&quot;” His students, Ibn Kathir and al-Dhahabi, held similar opinions about Abu Hanifa, extensively rebuking accusations against him and praising his contributions.

He received the honorific title &quot;al-Imam al-A&#x27;zam&quot; (&quot;the highly venerated Imām&quot;) and his tomb, surmounted by a dome erected by admirers in 1066 is still a shrine for pilgrims. It was restored in 1535 by Suleiman the Magnificent after the Ottoman conquest of Baghdad.

=== Negative ===
Abu Hanifa is considered to have been criticized by several figures, such as Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Mubārak, Sufyān al-Thawrī, Sufyān ibn ʿUyaynah, and al-Awzāʿī. According to some later sources, he was perceived by Ibn Abi Shaybah and Ibn Sa&#x27;d and to be a heretic and in opposition to the instructions of Muhammad, and al-Bukhari&#x27;s teacher, al-Humaydi, was one of the first to pen a refutation of his Abu Hanifa&#x27;s thought. The Zahiri scholar Ibn Hazm quoted Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah: &quot;The affairs of men were in harmony until they were changed by Abù Hanìfa in Kùfa, al-Batti in Basra and Màlik in Medina&quot;. Early Muslim jurist Hammad ibn Salamah once related a story about a highway robber who posed as an old man to hide his identity; he then remarked that were the robber still alive he would be a follower of Abu Hanifa.

Imam Ahmad was thought to have said, &quot;And it was narrated to me from Ishaq ibn Mansur Al-Kawsaj who said: I said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: “Is a man rewarded for hating Abu Hanifa and his companions?” He said: “Yes, by Allah.” Muhannah ibn Yahya Ash-Shami narrated to me (and said): I heard Ahmad ibn Hanbal say: “For me the opinion of Abu Hanifah and dung, are the same.” 

=== Today ===
Today, the Hanafi school is followed by 45% of Muslims and Abu Hanifa is popularly known amongst Sunni Muslims as a man of the highest personal qualities: a performer of good works, remarkable for his self-denial, humble spirit, devotion and pious awe of God.

==Generational status==

Abu Hanifa is regarded by some authorities as one of the &quot;tabi‘un&quot;, the generation after the &quot;sahaba&quot;, who were the companions of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. This is based on reports that he met at least four &quot;sahaba&quot; including Anas ibn Malik, with some even reporting that he transmitted &quot;hadith&quot; from him and other companions of Muhammad. Others take the view that Abu Hanifa only saw around half a dozen companions, possibly at a young age, and did not directly narrate hadith from them.

Abu Hanifa was born at least 60 years after the death of Muhammad, but during the time of the first generation of Muslims, some of whom lived on until Abu Hanifa&#x27;s youth. Anas ibn Malik, Muhammad&#x27;s personal attendant, died in 93 AH and another companion, Abul Tufail Amir bin Wathilah, died in 100 AH, when Abu Hanifa was at least 20 years old. The author of al-Khairat al-Hisan collected information from books of biographies and cited the names of Muslims of the first generation from whom it was reported that the Abu Hanifa had transmitted hadith. He counted 16 of them, including Anas ibn Malik, Jabir ibn Abd-Allah and Sahl ibn Sa&#x27;d.

== Students ==
Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Mizzi listed 97 hadith scholars who were his students. Most of them went on to be hadith scholars, and their narrated hadiths were compiled in the &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;, &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; and other books of hadith. Imām Badr al-Din al-Ayni included another 260 students who studied &quot;hadith&quot; and &quot;fiqh&quot; with Abu Hanifa.

His most famous students were Imām Abu Yusuf, who served as the first chief justice in the Muslim world, and Imām Muhammad al-Shaybani, who was the teacher of the Shafi‘i school of jurisprudence founder, Imām Al-Shafi‘i. His other students included Abdullah ibn Mubarak and Fudhayl bin Iyaadh

==Character and appearance==
Al-Nadr ibn Muhammad recalled Abu Hanifa had &quot;a beautiful face, beautiful clothing, and fragrant scent.&quot;

His student Abu Yusuf described him as &quot;well-formed, from the best of people in appearance, most eloquent in speech, sweetest in tone, and clearest in expressing his thoughts.&quot;

His son Hammad described him as &quot;very handsome, dark-skinned, having good posture, wearing much cologne, tall, not speaking except in reply to someone else, and not involving himself in what did not concern him.&quot;

Ibn al-Mubarak remarked he &quot;never saw a man more revered in gatherings, nor better in character and forbearance, than Abu Hanifa.&quot;

==Connection with the family of Muhammad ==

As with Malik ibn Anas (who was a teacher of Imam al-Shafi&#x27;i, who in turn was a teacher of Sunni Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal), Imam Abu Hanifa was a student of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, who was a descendant of the Islamic &quot;nabi&quot; (prophet) Muhammad. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni &quot;fiqh&quot; are connected to Ja&#x27;far from the &quot;bayt&quot; (household) of Muhammad, whether directly or indirectly.

In one &quot;hadith&quot;, Abu Hanifa once said about Imam Ja&#x27;far: &quot;I have not seen anyone with more knowledge than Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad.&quot; However, in another hadith, Abu Hanifa said: &quot;I met with Zayd (Ja&#x27;far&#x27;s uncle) and I never saw in his generation a person more knowledgeable, as quick a thinker, or more eloquent than he was.&quot;

==Opposition to anthropomorphism==
Imam Abu Hanifa was quoted as saying that Jahm ibn Safwan (d. 128/745) went so far in his denial of anthropomorphism (Tashbih) as to declare that &#x27;God is not something (Allah laysa bi shay&#x27;)&#x27;. Muqatil ibn Sulayman (d. 150/767), likened God to His creatures.

Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi narrated in his &quot;Tarikh Baghdad&quot; (History of Baghdad) that Imam Abu Hanifa said:

<doc id="419078" wikidata="Q374204" url="?curid=419078" title="Life of Pi">
<text>Life of Pi is a Canadian philosophical novel by Yann Martel published in 2001. The protagonist is Piscine Molitor &quot;Pi&quot; Patel, an Indian boy from Pondicherry, who explores issues of spirituality and metaphysics from an early age. After a shipwreck, he survives 227 days while stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker and an orangutan named Orange Juice along with several other zoo animals, raising questions about the nature of reality and how it is perceived and told.

The novel has sold more than ten million copies worldwide. It was rejected by at least five London publishing houses before being accepted by Knopf Canada, which published it in September 2001. Martel 
won the Man Booker Prize the following year. It was also chosen for CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; 2003, where it was championed by author Nancy Lee.

The French translation &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Pi&quot; was chosen in the French CBC version of the contest &quot;Le Combat des livres&quot;, where it was championed by Louise Forestier. The novel won the 2003 Boeke Prize, a South African novel award. In 2004, it won the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature in Best Adult Fiction for years 2001–2003. In 2012 it was adapted into a feature film directed by Ang Lee with a screenplay by David Magee.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

== Plot ==

The book begins with a note from the author, which is an integral part of the novel. Unusually, the note describes &quot;mostly&quot; fictional events. It serves to establish and enforce one of the book&#x27;s main themes: the relativity of truth.

=== Part one ===

In the 1960s, the narrator, Piscine Molitor &quot;Pi&quot; Patel, grows up as the son of the manager of a zoo in Pondicherry. While later recounting his life there, he offers insight on the antagonism of zoos and expresses his thoughts on why animals react less negatively than proponents of the idea suggest.

The narrator describes how he acquired his full name as a tribute to the swimming pool in France. After schoolmates tease him by transforming his first name into &quot;Pissing&quot;, he establishes the short form of his name as &quot;Pi&quot; when he starts secondary school. The name, he says, pays tribute to the transcendental number which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

In recounting his experiences, Pi describes several other unusual situations involving proper names: two visitors to the zoo, one a devout Muslim, and the other a committed atheist, bear identical names; and a Bengal tiger at the zoo bears the name Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error which switched the tiger&#x27;s name with the name of his human captor.

One day, Pi and his older brother Ravi are given an impromptu lesson on the dangers of the animals kept at the zoo. It opens with a goat being fed to another tiger, followed by a family tour of the zoo, during which his father explains the aggressive biological features of each animal.

Pi is raised as a Hindu and practices vegetarianism. At the age of fourteen, he investigates Christianity and Islam, and decides to become an adherent of all three religions, much to his parents&#x27; dismay (and his religious mentors&#x27; frustration), saying he &quot;just wants to love God&quot;. He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion, and comes to recognize benefits in each.

A few years later in February 1976, during the period when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declares &quot;The Emergency&quot;, Pi&#x27;s father decides to sell the zoo and emigrate with his wife and sons to Canada.

=== Part two ===

The second part of the novel begins in July 1977 with Pi&#x27;s family aboard the &quot;Tsimtsum&quot;, a Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to North America. A few days out of port from Manila, the ship encounters a storm and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat, only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena, an injured Grant&#x27;s zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. Much to the boy&#x27;s distress, the hyena kills the zebra and then Orange Juice. A tiger has been hiding under the boat&#x27;s tarpaulin: it is Richard Parker, who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself sometime before the hyena attack. Suddenly emerging from his hideaway, Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena.

Frightened, Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the bow of the boat, and makes it his place of retirement. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and seasickness as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting in the end that Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal.

Pi recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean. At his lowest point, exposure renders him blind and unable to catch fish.

Sometime later, Pi&#x27;s boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae inhabited by hundreds of thousands of meerkats. Soon, Pi and Richard Parker regain strength, but the boy&#x27;s discovery of the carnivorous nature of the island&#x27;s plant life forces him to return to the ocean.

Two hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship&#x27;s sinking, the lifeboat washes onto a beach in Mexico, after which Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle without looking back, leaving Pi heartbroken at the abrupt departure without even a farewell.

=== Part three ===

The third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale, but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, the ship&#x27;s cook, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor&#x27;s leg for use as fishing bait, and the sailor dies soon after. Pi and his mother are disgusted by the cook, but they cooperate with him to survive. However, after Pi fails to catch a turtle, the cook hits him, causing his mother to hit the cook in retaliation. They get into a violent fight, and the cook kills Pi&#x27;s mother. Soon after, the cook is killed by Pi, who eats him.

The investigators note parallels between the two stories. They soon conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi&#x27;s mother, and the tiger represents Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck, so he asks the officials which story they prefer: the one without animals or the one with animals. They finally choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says: &quot;And so it goes with God.&quot; The investigators then leave and file a report expressing belief in the first story.

== Inspiration ==

Martel said in a 2002 interview with PBS that he was &quot;looking for a story… that would direct my life&quot;. He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life, and he found that writing the novel met this need.

=== Richard Parker and shipwreck narratives ===

The name Richard Parker for the tiger was inspired by a character in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s nautical adventure novel &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; (1838). Richard Parker is a mutineer who is stranded and eventually cannibalized on the hull of an overturned ship, and there is a dog aboard who is named Tiger. Martel also had another occurrence in mind in the famous legal case &quot;R v Dudley and Stephens&quot; (1884), where a shipwreck again results in the cannibalism of a cabin boy named Richard Parker, this time in a lifeboat. A third Richard Parker drowned in the sinking of the &quot;Francis Spaight&quot; in 1846, with a cabin boy cannibalized during an incident involving the same ship in 1835. &quot;So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something&quot;, Martel suggested.

=== Moacyr Scliar ===

Martel has mentioned that a book review of Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar&#x27;s 1981 novella &quot;Max and the Cats&quot; accounts in part for his novel&#x27;s premise. Scliar&#x27;s story describes a Jewish German refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat. Scliar said that he was perplexed that Martel &quot;used the idea without consulting or even informing me,&quot; and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response. After talking with Martel, Scliar elected not to pursue the matter. A dedication to Scliar &quot;for the spark of life&quot; appears in the author&#x27;s note of &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. Literary reviews have described the similarities as superficial between &quot;Life of Pi&quot; and &quot;Max and the Cats&quot;. Reviewer Peter Yan wrote: &quot;Reading the two books side-by-side, one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book,&quot; and noted that Martel&#x27;s distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar&#x27;s novella. The themes of the books are also dissimilar, with &quot;Max and the Cats&quot; being a metaphor for Nazism. In &quot;Life of Pi&quot;, 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi&#x27;s experience in the lifeboat, compared to 17 of 99 pages in &quot;Max and the Cats&quot; depicting time spent in a lifeboat.

== Characters ==

=== Piscine Molitor &quot;Pi&quot; Patel ===
Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as just &quot;Pi&quot;, is the narrator and protagonist of the novel. He was named after a swimming pool in Paris, despite the fact that neither his mother nor his father particularly liked swimming. The story is told as a narrative from the perspective of a middle-aged Pi, who is now married with a family and living in Canada. At the time of the main events of the story, he was sixteen years old. He recounts the story of his life and his 227-day journey on a lifeboat when the ship he sailed sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a voyage to North America.

=== Richard Parker ===
Richard Parker is an adult Bengal tiger who is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks. Richard Parker lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers. Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle.

In the novel, a hunter named Richard Parker is hired to kill a panther that has been terrorising the people of a small village in Bangladesh and thought to have killed seven people within two months. Instead, he accidentally immobilizes a female Bengal tiger with tranquilizer darts while her cub is caught hiding in a bush. Parker names the cub Thirsty after his enthusiasm when drinking from a nearby river. The paperwork that accompanies the shipment of the two tigers to Pi&#x27;s family&#x27;s zoo in Pondicherry states that the cub&#x27;s name is &quot;Richard Parker&quot; and the hunter&#x27;s given name is &quot;Thirsty&quot; and his surname is &quot;None Given&quot;, due to a mix-up with the names. Pi&#x27;s father finds the story so amusing that they continue to call the tiger &quot;Richard Parker&quot;.

== Themes ==

Martel has said that &quot;Life of Pi&quot; can be summarized in three statements: &quot;Life is a story&quot;; &quot;You can choose your story&quot;; &quot;A story with God is the better story&quot;. Reviewer Gordon Houser suggests that there are two main themes of the book: &quot;that all life is interdependent, and that we live and breathe via belief.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Spectator&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and
&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot;. According to Book Marks, the book received &quot;rave&quot; reviews based on eight critic reviews with five being &quot;rave&quot; and two being &quot;positive&quot; and one being &quot;mixed&quot;. On Bookmarks November/December 2002 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (4.0 out of 5) based on critic reviews with a critical summary saying, &quot;Though some critics balked at the “baldly allegorical” nature of this story of a boy and the sea, this novel, an award winner in Canada, wins overall high marks&quot;. &quot;ReviewofBooks&quot; said on the critics consensus, &quot;Yann Martel is a master story teller and he weaves a tale that is entertaining and thought-provoking and at the end, he challenges you to believe it all. A top-notch read. From our review, &quot;&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is a delicious treat to savor&quot;. Globally, the work was received generally well with Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;Generally very impressed, and pleasantly surprised by how much he pulls off&quot;.

Brian Bethune of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; describes &quot;Life of Pi&quot; as a &quot;head-scratching combination of dense religious allegory, zoological lore and enthralling adventure tale, written with warmth and grace&quot;. &quot;Master Plots&quot; suggested that the &quot;central themes of &quot;Life of Pi&quot; concern religion and human faith in God&quot;.
Reutter said, &quot;So believable is Pi&#x27;s story telling that readers will be amazed.&quot; Gregory Stephens added that it &quot;achieves something more quietly spectacular.&quot; Jean Smith stated that there was &quot;no bamboozlement here.&quot; Gary Krist of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the book, but added that at times Martel &quot;pushes the didactic agenda of his story too hard.&quot;

In 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama wrote a letter directly to Martel, describing &quot;Life of Pi&quot; as &quot;an elegant proof of God, and the power of storytelling.&quot;

<doc id="419084" wikidata="Q194442" url="?curid=419084" title="Ahmad ibn Hanbal">
<text>Ahmad ibn Hanbal (; November 780 – 2 August 855) was a Muslim scholar, jurist, theologian, traditionist, ascetic and eponym of the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence—one of the four major orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam.
The most highly influential and active scholar during his lifetime, Ibn Hanbal went on to become &quot;one of the most venerated&quot; intellectual figures in Islamic history, who has had a &quot;profound influence affecting almost every area&quot; of the traditionalist perspective within Sunni Islam. One of the foremost classical proponents of relying on scriptural sources as the basis for Sunni Islamic law and way of life, Ibn Hanbal compiled one of the most significant Sunni hadith collections, &quot;al-Musnad&quot;, which has continued to exercise considerable influence on the field of hadith studies up to the present time.

Having studied jurisprudence and hadith under many teachers during his youth, Ibn Hanbal became famous in his later life for the crucial role he played in the Mihna instituted by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun toward the end of his reign, in which the ruler gave official state support to the Mu&#x27;tazili doctrine of the Quran being created, a view that contradicted the orthodox position of the Quran being the eternal, uncreated word of God. Living in poverty throughout his lifetime working as a baker, and suffering physical persecution under the caliphs for his unflinching adherence to the traditional doctrine, Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s fortitude in this particular event only bolstered his &quot;resounding reputation&quot; in the annals of Sunni history.

Ibn Hanbal later came to be venerated as an exemplary figure in all traditional schools of Sunni thought, both by the exoteric scholars and ascetic Sufis, with the latter often designating him as a saint in their hagiographies. The 12th-century jurist and theologian Ibn al-Jawzi relates he &quot;was the foremost in collecting the prophetic way and adhering to it.&quot; He was further praised by the 14th-century historian and traditionist al-Dhahabi, who referred to Ibn Hanbal as &quot;the true shaykh of Islam and imam of the Muslims in his time; the traditionist and proof of the religion&#x27;.&quot;

In the modern era, Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s name has become controversial in certain quarters of the Islamic world, as the Hanbali reform movement known as Wahhabism has cited him as a principal influence along with the 13th-century Hanbali reformer Ibn Taymiyya. However, it has been argued by certain scholars that Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s own beliefs actually played &quot;no real part in the establishment of the central doctrines of Wahhabism,&quot; as there is evidence, according to the same authors, &quot;the older Hanbali authorities had doctrinal concerns very different from those of the Wahhabis,&quot; due to medieval Hanbali literature being rich in references to saints, grave visitation, miracles, and relics. In this connection, scholars have cited Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s own support for the use of relics as one of several important points on which the theologian&#x27;s positions diverged from those adhering to Wahhabism. Other scholars maintain he was &quot;the distant progenitor of Wahhabism&quot;, who also immensely inspired the similar conservative reform movement of Salafism.

==Biography==

=== His Birth ===
Ahmad ibn Hanbal was born in the month of Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal in the year 164 AH/ November 780 CE. This was mentioned by his son Abdullah. Abdullah reported: &quot;I heard my father say: I was born in the month of Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal in the year 164 AH&quot;. Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s family was originally from Basra, and belonged to the Arab Banu Dhuhl tribe. His father was an officer in the Abbasid army in Khorasan and later settled with his family in Baghdad.

Historians differ about his place of birth. Some say he was said that he was born in Merv, located in Mary, Turkmenistan today, where his father and grandfather had also previously worked. While according to others he was born in Baghdad after his mother came pregnant with him from the city of Merv, where his father was. The latter opinion is the most accepted one.

=== His upbringing ===
Ibn Hanbal lost his father when he was a young child. His father died young at the age of thirty only. Then his mother raised him under the care of those who remained from his father&#x27;s family. His father had left him a property in Baghdad in which he lived, and another which yielded him a small rental income sufficient for his living. The reports are conflicting about whether it was large or small. Ibn Kathir mentioned its amount, saying: &quot;His income from his property was seventeen dirhams each month, which he spent on his family, and he was content with that, seeking the mercy of Allah, patiently and seeking reward.&quot; It is also narrated that a man asked Imam Ahmad about the property he was using on which he made a house on. He replied: &quot;This is something I inherited from my father. If a man comes to me and confirms that this is his, I will get rid of it and give it to him&quot;.

=== His Wives and Children ===
Ahmad ibn Hanbal did not marry until he reached the age of forty. It is said that this was because he was busy with knowledge, or because he traveled a lot and was away from his country for a long time. When he reached the age of forty and became closer to settling down than before, and he thought about marriage. Ibn al-Jawzi said about this: &quot;He, may God be pleased with him, was very keen on knowledge. He traveled far in search of it, and spend a long time on obtaining it. He did not occupy himself with earning or marriage until he achieved what he wanted from it.&quot;

His first wife was &quot;Abbasah bintul Fadl&quot;, an Arab girl from the suburbs of Baghdad, and she lived with Ahmad ibn Hanbal for thirty years(or twenty years according to some reports), and bore him their son &quot;Salih&quot;, and hence her she was known by her title Ummu Salih(lit: mother of Salih). Ibn Hanbal remarked about her: &quot;In the 30 (or 20) years we were together, we never had a disagreement.&quot; After her passing, Ahmad married his second wife, &quot;Ummu &#x27;Abdillah Rayhana bintu &#x27;Uma&quot; known simply as &quot;Rayhana&quot;, and she bore him one son, &quot;Abdullah&quot;. She known for having only one eye, and Ibn Hanbal married her because he was impressed by her religious commitment. Reports suggest that they were together for seven years. He also had a concubine named &quot;Husn&quot;, who bore him a female girl &quot;Zainab&quot;, then twins, &quot;Al-Hasan&quot; and &quot;Al-Hussein&quot;, who died after their birth. Then she bore &quot;Al-Hasan&quot; and &quot;Muhammad&quot;, and then she bored him &quot;Saeed&quot;. Among his sons, Salih and Abdullah excelled in jurisprudence, while Saeed later became the judge of Kufa.

===Education and work===
Ibn Hanbal studied extensively in Baghdad, and later traveled to further his education. He started learning jurisprudence under the celebrated judge of Hanafi jurisprudence, Abu Yusuf, who was the student and companion of Abu Hanifa. After completing his studies with him, Ibn Hanbal began traveling throughout Arabia to collect narrations of Muhammad. Ibn al-Jawzi stated Ibn Hanbal had 414 traditionists whom he narrated from. With this knowledge, he became a leading authority in the field, leaving behind an immense encyclopedia of narrations, &quot;al-Musnad&quot;. After several years of travel, he returned to Baghdad to study Islamic law under al-Shafi&#x27;i, with whom he formed a close bond with.

Ibn Hanbal became a judge in his old age. Through his students, the Hanbali school of jurisprudence was established, which is now most dominant in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Unlike the other three schools—Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi&#x27;i—the Hanbali school remained largely Athari in its theology.

In addition to his scholastic enterprises, Ibn Hanbal was a soldier in the war frontiers and performed pilgrimage five times in his life, twice on foot.

===Inquisition===

Ibn Hanbal is known to have been called before the Mihna of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun, who wanted to assert his religious authority by pressuring scholars to adopt the Mu&#x27;tazili doctrine of the Quran being created, rather than uncreated. According to Sunni tradition, Ibn Hanbal was one of the foremost scholars in resisting the caliph&#x27;s interference and his imposed doctrine. Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s stance led to the Hanbali school establishing itself firmly as not only a school of jurisprudence, but theology as well.

Because of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s refusal to accept the Mu&#x27;tazili doctrine, he was imprisoned in Baghdad throughout the reign of al-Ma&#x27;mun. In an incident during the rule of al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s successor, al-Mu&#x27;tasim, Ibn Hanbal was flogged to unconsciousness; however, this caused great upheaval in Baghdad and forced al-Mu&#x27;tasim to release him. After al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s death, al-Wathiq became caliph and continued his predecessors&#x27; policies of enforcing the Mu&#x27;tazili doctrine and, in this pursuit, banished Ibn Hanbal from Baghdad. It was only after al-Wathiq&#x27;s death and the ascent of his brother al-Mutawakkil, who was much more tolerating of the traditional Sunni beliefs, that Ibn Hanbal was welcomed back to Baghdad.

=== His appearance ===
His appearance according to Siyar A&#x27;lam al-Nubala&#x27; is:

Ibn Dharih al-&#x27;Ukbari said: &quot;I requested to see Ahmad bin Hanbal. So, I greeted him, and he was an old man who dyed his hair. He was tall and extremely dark.&quot;

Muhammad bin &#x27;Abbas an-Nahwi said: &quot;&quot;I saw Ahmad bin Hanbal with a handsome face, well-formed, and he dyed his hair with henna that was not too dark. He had black hairs in his beard, and I saw his clothes extremely white. When I saw him, he was wearing a turban and an izar&quot;.&quot;

&#x27;Abd al-Malik al-Maymuni said: &quot;&quot;I do not know that I have ever seen anyone who wore cleaner clothes, was more attentive to trimming his moustache and grooming the hair on his head and body, or wore purer and whiter garments than Ahmad bin Hanbal&quot;.&quot;

=== His illness and Death ===
At the end of his life, Ibn Hanbal became severely ill. His son Salih describes his illness as:

Ibn Hanbal died on Friday, 2 August 855 / 12 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal, 241 AH at the age of 74–75 in Baghdad. Historians relate his funeral was attended by 800,000 men and 60,000 women, and 20,000 Christians and Jews converted to Islam on that day. His grave is located in the premises of the Ahmad ibn Hanbal Mosque in al-Rusafa District.

==Views and thought==
Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s principal doctrine is what later came to be known as &quot;traditionalist thought,&quot; which emphasized the acceptance of only the Quran and hadith as the foundations of orthodox belief. He did, however, believe that it was only a select few who were properly authorized to interpret the sacred texts.

===Theology===

====God====

Ibn Hanbal understood the perfect definition of God to be that given in the Quran, whence he held that proper belief in God constituted believing in the description which God had given of Himself in the Islamic scripture. To begin with, Ibn Hanbal asserted that God was both Unique and Absolute and absolutely incomparable to anything in the world of His creatures. As for the various divine attributes, Ibn Hanbal believed that all the regular attributes of God, such as hearing, sight, speech, omnipotence, will, wisdom, the vision by the believers on the day of resurrection etc., were to be literally affirmed as &quot;realities&quot; (&quot;ḥaqq&quot;). As for those attributes called &quot;ambiguous&quot; (&quot;mutas̲h̲ābih&quot;), such as those which spoke of God&#x27;s hand, face, throne, and omnipresence, vision by the believers on the day of resurrection, etc. they were to be understood in the same manner. Ibn Hanbal treated those verses in the scriptures with apparently anthropomorphic descriptions as &quot;muhkamat&quot; (clear) verses; admitting to only a literal meaning.

Furthermore, Ibn Hanbal &quot;rejected the negative theology (&quot;taʿṭīl&quot;) of the Jahmiyya and their particular allegorizing exegesis (&quot;taʾwīl&quot;) of the Quran and of tradition, and no less emphatically criticized the anthropomorphism (&quot;tas̲h̲bīh&quot;) of the Mus̲h̲abbiha, amongst whom he included, in the scope of his polemics, the Jahmiyya as unconscious anthropomorphists.&quot; Ibn Hanbal was also a critic of overt and unnecessary speculation in matters of theology; he believed that it was fair to worship God &quot;without the &#x27;mode&#x27; of the theologoumena (&quot;bilā kayf&quot;), and felt it was wise to leave to God the understanding of His own mystery. Thus, Ibn Hanbal became a strong proponent of the &quot;bi-lā kayfa&quot; formula. This mediating principle allowed the traditionalists to deny &quot;ta&#x27;wil&quot; (figurative interpretations) of the apparently anthropomorphic texts while concomitantly affirming the doctrine of the &quot;incorporeal, transcendent deity&quot;. Although he argued for literalist meanings of the &quot;Qur&#x27;anic&quot; and prophetic statements about God, Ibn Hanbal was not a fideist and was willing to engage in hermeneutical exercises. The rise of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal and the &quot;Ashab al-Hadith&quot;, whose cause he championed, during the &quot;Mihna&quot;; would mark the stage for the empowerment and centering of corporealist ideas in the Sunnite orthodoxy.

Ibn Hanbal also recognized &quot;Divine Form (&quot;Al-Şūrah&quot;)&quot; as a true attribute of God. He disagreed with those speculative theologians who interpreted the Divine Form as something that represents pseudo-divinities such as the sun, moon, stars, etc. For Ibn Hanbal, to deny that God truly has a Form is Kufr (disbelief). He also believed that God created Adam &quot;according to His form&quot;. Censuring those who alleged that this was referring to the form of Adam, Ibn Hanbal asserted: &quot;He who says that Allah created Adam according to the form of Adam, he is a Jahmi (disbeliever). Which form did Adam have before He created him?&quot;

====The Quran====
One of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s most famous contributions to Sunni thought was the considerable role he played in bolstering the orthodox doctrine of the Quran being the &quot;uncreated Word of God&quot; (&quot;kalām Allāh g̲h̲ayr mak̲h̲lūḳ&quot;). By &quot;Quran,&quot; Ibn Hanbal understood &quot;not just an abstract idea but the Quran with its letters, words, expressions, and ideas—the Quran in all its living reality, whose nature &quot;in itself&quot;,&quot; according to Ibn Hanbal, eluded human comprehension.

==== &quot;Taqlid&quot; ====

Ibn Hanbal favoured independent reasoning (&quot;ijtihad&quot;) and rejected blind following (&quot;taqlid&quot;). His staunch condemnation of &quot;taqlid&quot; is reported in the treatise &quot;Fath al-Majid&quot; by Hanbali judge Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan (1782–1868). Comparing &quot;taqlid&quot; to polytheism (&quot;shirk&quot;), Ibn Hanbal states: &quot;I am amazed at those people who know that a chain of narration is authentic, and yet, in spite of this, they follow the opinion of Sufyan, for God says, &#x27;And let those who oppose the Messenger&#x27;s commandment beware, lest some &quot;fitna&quot; should befall them, or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&#x27; Do you know what that &quot;fitna&quot; is? That &quot;fitna&quot; is &quot;shirk&quot;. Maybe the rejection of some of his words would cause one to doubt and deviate in his heart, and thereby be destroyed.&quot;

====Intercession====
It is narrated by Abū Bakr al-Marwazī in his &quot;Mansak&quot; that Ibn Hanbal preferred one to make &quot;tawassul&quot; or &quot;intercession&quot; through Muhammad in every supplication, with the wording: &quot;O God! I am turning to Thee with Thy Prophet, the Prophet of Mercy. O Muhammad! I am turning with you to my Lord for the fulfillment of my need.&quot; This report is repeated in many later Hanbali works, in the context of personal supplication as an issue of jurisprudence. Ibn Qudamah, for example, recommends it for the obtainment of need in his &quot;Wasiyya&quot;. In the same way, Ibn Taymiyyah cites the Hanbali fatwa on the desirability of Muhammad&#x27;s intercession in every personal supplication in his &quot;Qāida fil-Tawassul wal-Wasiīla&quot; where he attributes it to &quot;Imām Ahmad and a group of the pious ancestors&quot; from the &quot;Mansak&quot; of al-Marwazī as his source.

====Mysticism====
As there exist historical sources indicating patently &quot;mystical elements in his personal piety&quot; and documented evidence of his amiable interactions with numerous early Sufi saints, including Maruf Karkhi, it is recognized that Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s relationship with many of the Sufis was one of mutual respect and admiration. Qadi Abu Ya&#x27;la reports in his &quot;Tabaqat&quot;: &quot;[Ibn Hanbal] used to greatly respect the Sūfīs and show them kindness and generosity. He was asked about them and was told that they sat in mosques constantly to which he replied, &#x27;Knowledge made them sit.&#x27;&quot; Furthermore, it is in Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s &quot;Musnad&quot; that we find most of the hadith reports concerning the abdal, forty major saints &quot;whose number [according to Islamic mystical doctrine] would remain constant, one always being replaced by some other on his death&quot; and whose key role in the traditional Sufi conception of the celestial hierarchy would be detailed by later mystics such as Hujwiri and Ibn Arabi. It has been reported that Ibn Hanbal explicitly identified Maruf Karkhi as one of the abdal, saying: &quot;He is one of the Substitute-Saints, and his supplication is answered.&quot; Of the same Sufi, Ibn Hanbal later asked rhetorically: &quot;Is religious knowledge anything else than what Maruf has achieved?&quot; Additionally, there are accounts of Ibn Hanbal extolling the early ascetic saint Bishr the Barefoot and his sister as two exceptional devotees of God, and of his sending people with mystical questions to Bishr for guidance. It is also recorded that Ibn Hanbal said, with regard to the early Sufis, &quot;I do not know of any people better than them.&quot; Moreover, there are accounts of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s son, Sālih, being exhorted by his father to go and study under the Sufis. According to one tradition, Sālih said: &quot;My father would send for me whenever a self-denier or ascetic (&quot;zāhid aw mutaqashshif&quot;) visited him so I could look at him. He loved for me to become like this.&quot;

As for the Sufis&#x27; reception of Ibn Hanbal, it is evident that he was &quot;held in high regard&quot; by all the major Sufis of the classical and medieval periods, and later Sufi chroniclers often designated the jurist as a saint in their hagiographies, praising him both for his legal work and for his appreciation of Sufi doctrine. Hujwiri, for example, wrote of him: &quot;He was distinguished by devoutness and piety ... Sufis of all orders regard him as blessed. He associated with great Shaykhs, such as Dhul-Nun of Egypt, Bishr al-Hafi, Sari al-Saqati, Maruf Karkhi, and others. His miracles were manifest and his intelligence sound ... He had a firm belief in the principles of religion, and his creed was approved by all the [theologians].&quot; Both non-Hanbali and Hanbali Sufi hagiographers such as Hujwiri and Ibn al-Jawzi, respectively, also alluded to Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s own gifts as a miracle worker and of the blessedness of his grave. For example, Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s own body was traditionally held to have been blessed with the miracle of incorruptibility, with Ibn al-Jawzi relating: &quot;When the Prophet&#x27;s descendant Abū Ja&#x27;far ibn Abī Mūsā was buried next to him, Ahmad ibn Hanbal&#x27;s tomb was exposed. His corpse had not putrified and the shroud was still whole and undecayed.&quot;

Although there is a perception that Ibn Hanbal or his school were somehow adverse to Sufism, scholars such as Eric Geoffrey have asserted that this opinion is more partial than objective, for there is no proof that the Hanbali school &quot;[attacked] Sufism in itself any more than any other school,&quot; and it is evident that &quot;during the first centuries some major Sufis [such as Ibn Ata Allah, Hallaj, and Abdullah Ansari] ... followed the Hanbalite school of law.&quot; By the twelfth-century, the relationship between Hanbalism and Sufism was so close that one of the most prominent Hanbali jurists, Abdul Qadir Jilani, was also simultaneously the most famous Sufi of his era, and the &quot;Tariqa&quot; that he founded, the Qadiriyya, has continued to remain one of the most widespread Sufi orders up until the present day. Even later Hanbali authors who were famous for criticizing some of the &quot;deviances&quot; of certain heterodox Sufi orders of their day, such as Ibn Qudamah, Ibn al-Jawzi, and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, all belonged to Abdul Qadir Jilani&#x27;s order themselves, and never condemned Sufism outright.

====Relics====
As has been noted by scholars, it is evident that Ibn Hanbal &quot;believed in the power of relics,&quot; and supported the seeking of blessing through them in religious veneration. Indeed, several accounts of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s life relate that he often carried &quot;a purse ... in his sleeve containing ... hairs from the Prophet.&quot; Furthermore, Ibn al-Jawzi relates a tradition narrated by Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s son, Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who recalled his father&#x27;s devotion towards relics thus: &quot;I saw my father take one of the Prophet&#x27;s hairs, place it over his mouth, and kiss it. I may have seen him place it over his eyes, and dip it in water and then drink the water for a cure.&quot; In the same way, Ibn Hanbal also drunk from Muhammad&#x27;s bowl (technically a &quot;second-class&quot; relic) in order to seek blessings from it, and considered touching and kissing the sacred minbar of Muhammad for blessings a permissible and pious act. Ibn Hanbal later ordered that he be buried with Muhammad&#x27;s hairs he possessed, &quot;one on each eye and a third on his tongue.&quot;

Sufi scholar Gibril Haddad reports from al-Dhahabi that Ibn Hanbal &quot;used to seek blessings from the relics of the Prophet.&quot; Citing the aforementioned report of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s devotion towards Muhammad&#x27;s hair, al-Dhahabī then goes onto staunchly criticize whoever finds fault with the practices of &quot;tabarruk&quot; or seeking blessings from holy relics, saying: &quot;Where is the quibbling critic of Imām Ahmad now? It is also authentically established that Abd Allāh [Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s son] asked his father about those who touch the pommel of Muhammad&#x27;s pulpit and touch the wall of his room, and he said: &#x27;I do not see any harm in it.&#x27; May God protect us and you from the opinion of the dissenters and from innovations!&quot;

When asked by his son Abdullah about the legitimacy of touching and kissing Muhammad&#x27;s grave in Medina, Ibn Hanbal is said to have approved of both these acts as being permissible according to sacred law.

===Jurisprudence===
According to Hanbali scholar Najm al-Din Tufi (d. 716 A.H/ 1316 C.E), Ahmad ibn Hanbal did not formulate a legal theory; since &quot;his entire concern was with &quot;hadith&quot; and its collection&quot;. More than a century after Ahmad&#x27;s death, Hanbali legalism would emerge as a distinct school; due to the efforts of jurists like Abu Bakr al-Athram (d. 261 A.H/ 874 C.E), Harb al-Kirmani (d. 280 A.H/ 893 C.E), &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Ahmad (d. 290 A.H/903 C.E), Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311 A.H/ 923 C.E) etc., who compiled Ahmad&#x27;s various legal verdicts.

====Independent reasoning by muftis====
Ibn Hanbal also had a strict criterion for ijtihad or independent reasoning in matters of law by muftis and the ulema. One story narrates that Ibn Hanbal was asked by Zakariyyā ibn Yaḥyā al-Ḍarīr about &quot;how many memorized ḥadīths are sufficient for someone to be a mufti [meaning a &quot;mujtahid&quot; jurist or one capable of issuing independently reasoned fatwas].&quot; According to the narrative, Zakariyyā asked: &quot;Are one-hundred thousand sufficient?&quot; to which Ibn Hanbal responded in the negative, with Zakariyyā asking if two-hundred thousand were, to which he received the same response from the jurist. Thus, Zakariyyā kept increasing the number until, at five-hundred thousand, Ibn Hanbal said: &quot;I hope that that should be sufficient.&quot; As a result, it has been argued that Ibn Hanbal disapproved of independent reasoning by those muftis who were not absolute masters in law and jurisprudence.

====Misusing &quot;ahadith&quot;====
Ibn Hanbal narrated from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā al-Qaṭṭān that the latter said: &quot;If someone were to follow every &quot;rukhṣa&quot; [dispensation] that is in the ḥadīth, he would become a transgressor (&quot;fāsiq&quot;).&quot; It is believed that he quoted this on account of the vast number of forged traditions of Muhammad.

====Private interpretation====

Ibn Hanbal appears to have been a formidable opponent of &quot;private interpretation,&quot; and actually held that it was only the religious scholars who were qualified to properly interpret the holy texts. One of the creeds attributed to Ibn Hanbal opens with: &quot;Praise be to God, who in every age and interval between prophets (&quot;fatra&quot;) elevated learned men possessing excellent qualities, who call upon him who goes astray (to return) to the right way.&quot; It has been pointed out that this particular creed &quot;explicitly opposes the use of personal judgement (&quot;raʾy&quot;) ... [as basis] of jurisprudence.&quot;

===Ethics===

====Differences of opinion====
Ibn Hanbal was praised both in his own life and afterwards for his &quot;serene acceptance of juridical divergences among the various schools of Islamic law&quot;. According to later notable scholars of the Hanbali school like Ibn Aqil and Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Hanbal &quot;considered every madhhab correct and abhorred that a jurist insist people follow his even if he considered them wrong and even if the truth is one in any given matter.&quot; As such, when Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s student Ishāq ibn Bahlūl al-Anbārī had &quot;compiled a book on juridical differences ... which he had named &quot;The Core of Divergence&quot; (&quot;Lubāb al-Ikhtilāf&quot;),&quot; Ibn Hanbal advised him to name the work &quot;The Book of Leeway&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Sa&#x27;a&quot;) instead.

* &quot;Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal&quot;

==Historical views==
Ibn Hanbal has been extensively praised for both his work in the field of prophetic tradition (&quot;hadith&quot;), jurisprudence, and his defense of orthodox Sunni theology. Abdul-Qadir Gilani stated that a Muslim could not truly be a wali of Allah except that they were upon Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s creed; despite praise from his contemporaries as well, Yahya ibn Ma&#x27;in noted that Ibn Hanbal never boasted about his achievements.

=== Jurisprudence ===
There have some alleged views that his juristic views were not always accepted. Qur&#x27;anic exegete Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, who at one time had sought to study under Ibn Hanbal, later stated that he did not consider Ibn Hanbal a jurist and gave his views in the field no weight, describing him as an expert in prophetic tradition only. However this must be seen in context of its time, as Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s school was still at its infancy and not followed by so many people yet compared to the other schools and the students had conflict with Al-Tabari&#x27;s school. Consider how the &quot;Masa&#x27;il&quot; of Imam Ahmad, i.e. the first written compilation of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s question and answers, was written by Abu Bakr al-Khallal who lived around the same time as Al-Tabari, and the first written compilation of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s fiqh was Al-Khiraqi who also lived around that same time. The more systematic teaching of Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s jurisprudence in education facilities only occurred after that point.

Likewise, some consider how the Andalusian scholar Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Barr did not include Ibn Hanbal or his views in his book &quot;The Hand-Picked Excellent Merits of the Three Great Jurisprudent Imâms&quot; about the main representatives of Sunni jurisprudence. However, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Barr actually has praised Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s jurisprudence by saying &quot;He is very powerful in the fiqh of the madhab of the ahl al-hadith and he is the Imam of the &#x27;ulama of ahl al-hadith.&quot;

Be that as it may, the vast majority of other scholars do recognize Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s prowess as a master jurist worthy of one whose methodology became foundation for its own school of jurisprudence. Imam Shafi&#x27;i said, among many other praises, &quot;Ahmad is an Imam in eight fields: he is an imam in &quot;hadith&quot;, jurisprudence, &quot;Al-Qur&#x27;an, Al-Lughah, Al-Sunnah, Al-Zuhd, Al-Warak, and Al-Faqr&quot;&quot;. Al-Dhahabi, one of the most major Islamic biographers, notes in his masterpiece &quot;Siyar A&#x27;lam Nubala&quot; that Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s status in jurisprudence is alike Al-Layth ibn Sa&#x27;d, Malik ibn Anas, Al-Shafi&#x27;i, and Abu Yusuf. Muhammad Abu Zahra, a contemporary Hanafi scholar, wrote a book titled &quot;Ibn Hanbal: Hayatuhu wa `Asruhu Ara&#x27;uhu wa Fiqhuh,&quot; and there he mentioned the heavy praises of various other classical scholars towards Ibn Hanbal and his school of jurisprudence.

=== Hadith ===
It is reported that Ibn Hanbal has reached the title of &quot;al Hafidh&quot; of Hadith according to Jamal al-Din al-Mizzi classification, as the title bestowment were approved by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani that Ibn Hanbal has memorized at least 750,000 hadith during his life, more than Muhammad al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj who each memorized 300,000 hadith, and Abu Dawud al-Sijistani who memorized 500,000 hadith. Abu Zur&#x27;ah mentions that Ibn Hanbal has memorized 1,000,000 &quot;hadith,&quot; 700,000 among them are related to jurisprudence.

While according to the classification from Marfu&#x27; Hadith of Ibn Abbas which recorded by Al-Tabarani, Ibn Hanbal has reached the rank of &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin al-Hadith&quot;, a rank that only reached by very few Hadith scholars in history such as Malik ibn Anas, Yahya ibn Ma&#x27;in, Hammad ibn Salamah, Ibn al-Mubarak, and Al-Suyuti. Ibn Hanbal&#x27;s Musnad is not, however, ranked among the &quot;Kutub al-Sittah&quot;, the six big collections of hadith.

==In popular culture==
* Ahmad ibn Hanbal was largely depicted in Qatar TV&#x27;s 2017 Ramadan drama serial &quot;The Imam&quot; starring Mahyar Khaddour in the lead role.

<text>, also known as Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Metropolis or Robotic Angel (in Germany, due to an objection by the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation), is a Japanese manga by Osamu Tezuka published in 1949. It is the second work in what is regarded as Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s early science fiction trilogy, consisting of &quot;Lost World&quot; (1948), &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1949) and &quot;Nextworld&quot; (1951). It has been adapted into a feature-length anime, released in 2001. Though it has parallels to the 1927 film of the same name, Tezuka has stated that he had only seen a single still image of the film in a magazine at the time of creating his manga.

==Plot==

The story begins with a scientist, Dr. Yorkshire Bell, noting that dinosaurs once flourished and became extinct when they advanced beyond their ability to adapt to change. Giant mammals, such as the saber-toothed tiger and the mammoth, came and went the same way. Humans, Earth&#x27;s current dominant life form, had one special asset – intelligence – enabling them to advance further than all creatures before them. Dr. Bell wondered if, one day, humans might advance beyond the point of no return and render themselves extinct.

In the summer of 19XX, a bulletin reveals that a prolonged investigation by the United Nations Police has discovered a plot by a murderous secret society known as &quot;The Red Party&quot;, led by master of disguise Duke Red, has infiltrated the International Scientists Conference held in Metropolis. While Duke Red orders his henchman to follow Dr. Charles Lawton, M.D., all the scientists notice that the Sun is now covered with sunspots, causing its radiation levels to rise. Lawton, back in his laboratory, had almost given up on his thirty-year experiment into synthetic cells (imitation eukaryotes composed of non-organic material and designed to mimic organic cells, in order for enough of them to be fashioned into true-to-life prosthetic organs and body parts) when he noticed the sunspots had irradiated his tank of synthetic proteins and brought them to life. So had Duke Red, who ordered Lawton to create an entire human body out of synthetic tissue, its face modeled after a marble statue and possessing several superpowers. Fearing his creation would be used for evil, Lawton brought it to life and destroyed his lab, making Duke Red believe their creation had been destroyed. In reality, Lawton had rescued the artificial human and was raising it as his own child in secret, thanks to some help from Dr. Bell. When &quot;Michi&quot; (his name) accidentally rendered its &quot;father&quot; unconscious and went out to play, he stopped a truck from running over a girl selling flowers. When the boy was mobbed by an awestruck crowd, another boy named Ken&#x27;ichi dragged him to the Dam Dharma Museum and the statue it was modeled after. They learned from the curator that it was called &quot;The Angel of Rome&quot;, possessing the most beautiful face in the world - not knowing that Dharma himself was a member of the Red Party who supplied the statue to Duke Red.

The Red Party paid Lawton a visit, resulting in Lawton being mortally wounded, which was witnessed by Detective &quot;Moustachio&quot; from Japan who, unfortunately, had to release them because he had no arrest warrant. Lawton showed Moustachio a film telling the whole story of Michi&#x27;s creation, as well as a journal detailing all of his powers. Arriving at his Japanese American relatives&#x27; home, he discovered his nephew, Ken&#x27;ichi, had brought home Michi. Revealing Lawton&#x27;s death and true paternal status, Moustachio entrusted Michi to Ken&#x27;ichi&#x27;s care while he consulted Superintendent General Notarlin of the Metropolis Police Department.

Notarlin introducing him to Police Inspector Ganimarl from France and Sherlock Holmes from England, Moustachio went with them to a monster sighting behind the Dharma Museum, where they were attacked by giant rats (which bear a striking resemblance to Mickey Mouse) and crashed into a fake tree which led Moustachio to the Red Party&#x27;s underground headquarters. His presence discovered, Moustachio attempted to escape, aided by Fifi, one of the Red Party&#x27;s slave robots, but was caught and Fifi destroyed. Duke Red revealed that the Red Party was developing a chemical weapon called Toron Gas as well as was responsible for the &quot;man-made&quot; sunspots, using a substance called omothenium (which intercepts gravity) to raise the Earth&#x27;s temperature enough to melt the Antarctic ice cap in order to build their new headquarters upon the defrosted continent. Unable to get Moustachio to hand over Michi, the Red Party locks him in a chamber to become their first guinea pig.

Michi is introduced as a new student at Ken&#x27;ichi&#x27;s junior high school, as well as Emmy, the violet-seller girl Michi had saved - unknown to the class, Emmy&#x27;s schooling was being sponsored by a strange old man in exchange for luring Michi to her gangster older sister. At home, Ken&#x27;ichi accidentally discovered Dr. Lawton&#x27;s journal revealing Michi as an artificial human with cybernetic super-powers - including helium-induced flight, gills in his ears to breathe under water, and a gender-change button in his throat - which Ken&#x27;ichi tested successfully at home. At the Metropolis Police Department, Dr. Yorkshire Bell had been summoned by Notarlin to examine the giant rats scientifically named &quot;Mikimaus Waltdisneus&quot; and revealed that giant animals and vegetables were growing all over the world because of the sunspots. Holmes arrived to reveal Duke Red as responsible for the sunspots as well as his current disguise - the strange old man helping Emmy. Ganimarl tracked the man to Emmy&#x27;s home, where the man was being held up for more money by her sister&#x27;s gangster friends. Exposed, Duke Red gassed Ganimarl unconscious and left him in disguise for the police to find, and threatened Emmy&#x27;s sister to deliver Michi to him.

Back at Red Party headquarters, Moustachio realized the Toron Gas hadn&#x27;t been released because the rats had overrun the underground base. Disguising himself within the skin of one of the rats, Moustachio found the base&#x27;s CPU and a short-circuited slave robot. Reactivating the robot, he ordered it to immediately destroy the CPU and then destroy the Red Party&#x27;s food and water supplies at the right time, then played dead so Duke Red&#x27;s henchman would dispose of the rat&#x27;s corpse with him in it. Ken&#x27;ichi and Michi arrived at school to find the police questioning Emmy about whether her sister belonged to the Red Party. The other schoolchildren learned about Emmy&#x27;s sister&#x27;s criminal connection and attempted to expel her, but Michi saved her; Emmy returned the favor by telling Michi she knew the location of Michi&#x27;s father, but she was abducted by a giant wasp. Michi saved her again and Emmy admitted to lying about Michi&#x27;s father. Ken&#x27;ichi insisted Emmy stay in his house for protection, but her sister and her friends entered and demanded Ken&#x27;ichi bring Michi to them. He did, first activating Michi&#x27;s gender switch; the gangster&#x27;s left because they wanted Michi the boy, not the girl. After Ken&#x27;ichi informed Emmy of Michi&#x27;s true nature, they discovered Michi had run away.

Moustachio arrived at the Metropolis Police Department to inform Notarlin and Ganimarl that Duke Red had been infiltrating the police to spy on them as Sherlock Holmes. Duke Red had the police arrest Notarlin and Ganimarl, having recruited more than half of them into the Red Party, and left Moustachio free, telling him Michi had escaped, and the Red Party had to pursue him. They used their mobile headquarters - the &quot;Atlantis&quot;, a 200,000-ton luxury liner - to hold Notarlin and Ganimarl while pursuing Michi, little knowing that girl-Michi had unknowingly stowed away onto the ship, was discovered, and recruited as a cabin girl. Michi discovered the crew&#x27;s true identities and used the ship&#x27;s radio to contact the police, who sent a search plane with Ken&#x27;ichi on board to find it. Michi was caught and admitted her name. When he mistook Duke Red to be her father, Duke Red revealed Michi&#x27;s artificial nature and criminal purpose. As a result, Michi&#x27;s mind snapped and he attacked the Red Party, the henchmen discovering he was also bulletproof. Confronting the Red Party&#x27;s slave robots, Michi convinced them to destroy the food and water supply and scuttle the ship. The Red Party attempted to abandon ship but were arrested by Notarlin and Ganimarl, who escaped their cell in the confusion, and then thrown overboard by the robots. Notarlin and Ganimarl, having fled up the mast, watched as the robots condemned Duke Red to being incinerated in the ship&#x27;s boiler, then were rescued by Ken&#x27;ichi&#x27;s search plane.

The party were then downed by Michi and witness his declaration of war against the human race, marching towards Metropolis along the ocean floor. Unable to contact Moustachio because of the sunspots interfering with radio transmissions, they drifted towards Long Boot Island, where a surviving member of the Red Party told them the omothenium radiation emitter had created the sunspots but also enlarged all flora and fauna, his colleagues having been eaten by giant ants. Destroying the emitter, they saw the man-made sunspots disappear right before their eyes. Receiving warning of the robot army, Moustachio had the police declare martial law and move the populace to underground shelters. Dr. Bell warned Moustachio that a poisonous gas, which destroyed human brains to reduce them to animals, was being released; Moustachio recognized it as Toron gas. Michi and the robots having destroyed the Red Party&#x27;s underground gas cylinders, and among the first victims were looters along with Emmy&#x27;s sister.

Michi knocked down Metropolis&#x27; skyscrapers by hand while the slave robots took on the people on the ground. While the ordinary robots were easily dealt with, Ken&#x27;ichi attempted to reason with Michi, then challenge him using judo. When Michi gained the upper hand, his body started to smoke, and he fell off the roof. While the citizens wanted Michi&#x27;s destruction, a broadcast by Dr. Bell informed them of Michi&#x27;s mental breakdown due to Duke Red and that he was dying; because the sunspots were gone, their unique radiation which powered Michi&#x27;s synthetic cells faded away, and his body was disintegrating. As everyone, including Michi&#x27;s classmates, witnessed the end of science&#x27;s greatest work of art, Dr. Bell reflected, as he had at the beginning of the story, if humanity&#x27;s advancement was capable of engineering its self-destruction.

==Afterword==
Osamu Tezuka noted that, after his breakthrough manga &quot;Shin Takarajima&quot; (&quot;New Treasure Island&quot;) was released in 1947, Kansai was deluged by Osaka-made &quot;Akahon&quot; manga (&quot;red book&quot;, due to the red ink used on the covers). Various publishing companies wanted to break away from the junk comic books and start releasing &quot;real&quot; books, so Tezuka proposed creating an epic, full-length science-fiction graphic novel.

Having only half a year to create a 160-page story, Tezuka assembled a basic plot from elements of unpublished work, the inspiration for the central character coming from a publicity still of the female robot from &quot;Metropolis&quot; (even though he had never seen the film or even known what it was about). When the manga was released, the response from the public was far greater than he imagined and that many students were inspired to become manga artists because of it.

The setting was based on pre-war Manhattan and Chicago, Emmy and her sister partly from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Michi&#x27;s powers from &quot;Superman&quot; (perhaps, although Tezuka never made the connection between the title of his work and Superman&#x27;s city), Michi&#x27;s burning from &quot;The Invisible Ray&quot;, and Michi&#x27;s death scene from &quot;The Monstrous Fellows of the Country Underground&quot; (another Tezuka manga from 1948).

The characters Duke Red and Notarlin made their debut in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, and both of them featured in later works. The character of Michi became the prototype for both the lead characters of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, neither of which may have come into existence without Michi (Michi even made a cameo as Hoshie Tenma, Astro Boy&#x27;s mother).

==Cast==
Due to Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Star System, some of his characters from other manga appeared in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, in different roles and with different names. Others appeared here for the first time but were later used by Tezuka in other manga.

* Michi as &quot;Michi&quot;: The artificial humanoid created by Dr. Lawton to be used as a powerful weapon by the Red Party, but Michi is not aware of any of this.
* Ken&#x27;ichi Shikishima as &quot;Ken&#x27;ichi&quot;: A good-hearted, but naive boy who becomes good friends with Michi, but after Michi turns against humanity, Ken&#x27;ichi has to see if he has to strength to fight his best friend.
* Shunsaku Ban as &quot;Detective Moustachio&quot;: A detective on the search for Dr. Charles Lawton. As luck would have it, he is present when the Red Party guns down Dr. Lawton. Together with Ken&#x27;ichi, he uses his detective skills to try to find Michi&#x27;s parents.
* Makeru Butamo as &quot;Dr. Charles Lawton&quot;: A scientist hired by Duke Red to create the perfect humanoid, one that could look and act just like a human. However, Dr. Lawton doesn&#x27;t want his creation to be used as a weapon, nor does he want anyone else getting their hands on his greatest creation. To this end, he takes Michi and runs to try to escape the Red Party.
* Duke Red as &quot;Duke Red&quot;: A power mad politician with aspirations for world domination.
* Doctor Hanamaru as &quot;Dr. Yorkshire Bell&quot;: A calm, wise scientist with a sage-like beard, who studies the radioactive sunspots and strange happenings around the city alongside Notaarin.
* Notaarin as &quot;Notaarin&quot;: The superintendent general of the Metropolis police force, who hunts out Duke Red and the Red Party.

==English translation==
In the United States, the manga was published in English by Dark Horse Comics with translations provided by Kumar Sivasubramanian and Studio Proteus, and editing consulting by Toren Smith, but is now out of print.

== Film adaptation ==

&quot;Metropolis&quot; is a 2001 anime film loosely based on the 1949 &quot;Metropolis&quot; manga. The anime, however, does draw aspects of its storyline directly from the 1927 film. The anime had an all-star production team, including renowned anime director Rintaro, &quot;Akira&quot; creator Katsuhiro Otomo as script writer, and animation by Madhouse Studios with conceptual support from Tezuka Productions.

<doc id="419093" wikidata="Q211679" url="?curid=419093" title="Zeitgeist">
<text>In 18th- and 19th-century German philosophy, a Zeitgeist (; ; capitalized in German) is an invisible agent, force, or daemon dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history. The term is usually associated with Georg W. F. Hegel, contrasting with Hegel&#x27;s use of &quot;Volksgeist&quot; &quot;national spirit&quot; and &quot;Weltgeist&quot; &quot;world-spirit&quot;. 

Its coinage and popularization precede Hegel, and are mostly due to Herder and Goethe. Other philosophers who were associated with such concepts include Spencer and Voltaire.

Contemporary use of the term sometimes, more colloquially, is similar to the Overton Window in referring to a schema of fashions or fads that prescribe what is considered to be acceptable or tasteful for an era: e.g., in fields like architecture, psychotherapy, or journalism.

==Theory of leadership==

Hegel in &quot;Phenomenology of the Spirit&quot; (1807) uses both &quot;Weltgeist&quot; and &quot;Volksgeist&quot;, but prefers the phrase &quot;Geist der Zeiten&quot; &quot;spirit of the times&quot; over the compound &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;.

The Hegelian concept is in contrast to the Great Man theory propounded by Thomas Carlyle, which sees history as the result of the actions of heroes and geniuses. In contrast, Hegel perceived such &quot;great men&quot;, specifically Napoleon, as the &quot;embodiment of the world-spirit&quot; (&quot;Die Weltseele zu Pferde&quot; &quot;the world-soul on horseback&quot;). Carlyle stresses that leaders do not become leaders by fate or accident. Instead, these individuals possess characteristics of great leaders and these characteristics allow them to obtain positions of power.

According to Hegel biographer D. R. Forsyth, Leo Tolstoy disagreed with Carlyle&#x27;s perspective, instead believing that leadership, like other things, was a product of the &quot;zeitgeist&quot;, the social circumstances at the time.

Great Man theory and zeitgeist theory may be included in two main areas of thought in psychology. For instance, Great Man theory is very similar to the trait approach. Trait researchers are interested in identifying the various personality traits that underline human behaviors such as conformity, leadership, or other social behaviors. Thus, they agree that leadership is primarily a quality of an individual and that some people are pre-dispositioned to be a leader whereas others are born to follow these leaders. In contrast, situationist researchers believe that social behavior is a product of society. That is, social influence is what determines human behaviors. Therefore, situationism is of the same opinion as zeitgeist theory—leaders are created from the social environment and are molded from the situation. The concept of zeitgeist also relates to the sociological tradition that stems from Émile Durkheim and recently developed into social capital theory as exemplified by the work of Patrick Hunout.

These two perspectives have been combined to create what is known as the &quot;interactional&quot; approach to leadership. This approach asserts that leadership is developed through the mixing of personality traits and the situation. Further, this approach was expressed by social psychologist Kurt Lewin by the equation B = f(P, E) where behavior (B) is a function (f) of the person (P) and the environment (E).

===In self-help and business models===
Executives, venture capitalists, journalists, and authors have argued that the idea of a zeitgeist is useful in understanding the emergence of industries, simultaneous invention, and evaluating the relative value of innovations. Malcolm Gladwell argued in his book, &quot;Outliers&quot;, that entrepreneurs who succeeded often share similar characteristics—early personal or significant exposure to knowledge and skills in the early stages of a nascent industry. He proposed that the timing of involvement in an industry, and often in sports as well, affected the probability of success. In Silicon Valley, a number of people (Peter Thiel, Alistair Davidson, Mac Levchin, Nicholas G. Carr, Vinod Khosla) have argued that much innovation has been shaped by easy access to the Internet, open source software, component technologies for both hardware and software (e.g., software libraries, software as a service), and the ability to reach narrow markets across a global market. Peter Thiel has commented: &quot;There is so much incrementalism now.&quot;

In a zeitgeist market, the number of new entrants is high, differentiation in high-value products (the strongest predictor of new product success) is more difficult to achieve, and business models emphasizing service and solution over product and process, will enhance success. Examples include innovation in product experience, legal rights and bundling, privacy rights, and agency (where businesses act on behalf of customers).

<text>Adipose tissue (also known as body fat or simply fat) is a loose connective tissue composed mostly of adipocytes. It also contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and a variety of immune cells such as adipose tissue macrophages. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body.

Previously treated as being hormonally inert, in recent years adipose tissue has been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and cytokines (especially TNFα). In obesity, adipose tissue is implicated in the chronic release of pro-inflammatory markers known as adipokines, which are responsible for the development of metabolic syndromea constellation of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.

Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes and its formation appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. The two types of adipose tissue are white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores energy, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which generates body heat. Adipose tissuemore specifically brown adipose tissuewas first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.

==Anatomical features==

In humans, adipose tissue is located: beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat), around internal organs (visceral fat), in bone marrow (yellow bone marrow), intermuscular (muscular system), and in the breast (breast tissue). Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which are referred to as &quot;adipose depots&quot;. Apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose tissue, other cell types are present, collectively termed stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells. SVF includes preadipocytes, fibroblasts, adipose tissue macrophages, and endothelial cells.

Adipose tissue contains many small blood vessels. In the integumentary system, which includes the skin, it accumulates in the deepest level, the subcutaneous layer, providing insulation from heat and cold. Around organs, it provides protective padding. However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be oxidised to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess glucose by storing triglycerides produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence suggests that most lipid synthesis from carbohydrates occurs in the adipose tissue itself. Adipose depots in different parts of the body have different biochemical profiles. Under normal conditions, it provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain.

===Mice===
Mice have eight major adipose depots, four of which are within the abdominal cavity. The paired gonadal depots are attached to the uterus and ovaries in females and the epididymis and testes in males; the paired retroperitoneal depots are found along the dorsal wall of the abdomen, surrounding the kidney, and, when massive, extend into the pelvis. The mesenteric depot forms a glue-like web that supports the intestines and the omental depot (which originates near the stomach and spleen) and - when massive - extends into the ventral abdomen. Both the mesenteric and omental depots incorporate much lymphoid tissue as lymph nodes and milky spots, respectively.

The two superficial depots are the paired inguinal depots, which are found anterior to the upper segment of the hind limbs (underneath the skin) and the subscapular depots, paired medial mixtures of brown adipose tissue adjacent to regions of white adipose tissue, which are found under the skin between the dorsal crests of the scapulae. The layer of brown adipose tissue in this depot is often covered by a &quot;frosting&quot; of white adipose tissue; sometimes these two types of fat (brown and white) are hard to distinguish. The inguinal depots enclose the inguinal group of lymph nodes. Minor depots include the pericardial, which surrounds the heart, and the paired popliteal depots, between the major muscles behind the knees, each containing one large lymph node. Of all the depots in the mouse, the gonadal depots are the largest and the most easily dissected, comprising about 30% of dissectible fat.

===Obesity===
In an obese person, excess adipose tissue hanging downward from the abdomen is referred to as a panniculus. A panniculus complicates surgery of the morbidly obese individual. It may remain as a literal &quot;apron of skin&quot; if a severely obese person loses large amounts of fat (a common result of gastric bypass surgery). Obesity is treated through exercises, diet, and behavioral therapy, liposuctions. Reconstructive surgery is one aspect of treatment.

===Visceral fat===
Visceral fat or abdominal fat (also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat) is located inside the abdominal cavity, packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.). Visceral fat is different from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles. Fat in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semi-fluid. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots. Visceral fat is often expressed in terms of its area in cm2 (VFA, visceral fat area).

An excess of visceral fat is known as abdominal obesity, or &quot;belly fat&quot;, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. New developments such as the Body Volume Index (BVI) are specifically designed to measure abdominal volume and abdominal fat. Excess visceral fat is also linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related diseases. Likewise, the accumulation of neck fat (or cervical adipose tissue) has been shown to be associated with mortality. Several studies have suggested that visceral fat can be predicted from simple anthropometric measures, and predicts mortality more accurately than body mass index or waist circumference.

Men are more likely to have fat stored in the abdomen due to sex hormone differences. Estrogen (female sex hormone) causes fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs, and hips in women. When women reach menopause and the estrogen produced by the ovaries declines, fat migrates from the buttocks, hips and thighs to the waist; later fat is stored in the abdomen.

Visceral fat can be caused by excess cortisol levels. At least 10 MET-hours per week of aerobic exercise leads to visceral fat reduction in those without metabolic-related disorders. Resistance training and caloric restriction also reduce visceral fat, although their effect may not be cumulative. Both exercise and hypocaloric diet cause loss of visceral fat, but exercise has a larger effect on visceral fat versus total fat. High-intensity exercise is one way to effectively reduce total abdominal fat. An energy-restricted diet combined with exercise will reduce total body fat and the ratio of visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue, suggesting a preferential mobilization for visceral fat over subcutaneous fat.

====Epicardial fat====
Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a particular form of visceral fat deposited around the heart and found to be a metabolically active organ that generates various bioactive molecules, which might significantly affect cardiac function. Marked component differences have been observed in comparing EAT with subcutaneous fat, suggesting a location-specific impact of stored fatty acids on adipocyte function and metabolism.

===Subcutaneous fat===
Most of the remaining nonvisceral fat is found just below the skin in a region called the hypodermis. This subcutaneous fat is not related to many of the classic obesity-related pathologies, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke, and some evidence even suggests it might be protective. The typically female (or gynecoid) pattern of body fat distribution around the hips, thighs, and buttocks is subcutaneous fat, and therefore poses less of a health risk compared to visceral fat.

Like all other fat organs, subcutaneous fat is an active part of the endocrine system, secreting the hormones leptin and resistin.

The relationship between the subcutaneous adipose layer and total body fat in a person is often modelled by using regression equations. The most popular of these equations was formed by Durnin and Wormersley, who rigorously tested many types of skinfold, and, as a result, created two formulae to calculate the body density of both men and women. These equations present an inverse correlation between skinfolds and body density—as the sum of skinfolds increases, the body density decreases.

Factors such as sex, age, population size or other variables may make the equations invalid and unusable, and, , Durnin and Wormersley&#x27;s equations remain only estimates of a person&#x27;s true level of fatness. New formulae are still being created.

=== Marrow fat ===
Marrow fat, also known as marrow adipose tissue (MAT), is a poorly understood adipose depot that resides in the bone and is interspersed with hematopoietic cells as well as bony elements. The adipocytes in this depot are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which can give rise to fat cells, bone cells as well as other cell types. The fact that MAT increases in the setting of calorie restriction/ anorexia is a feature that distinguishes this depot from other fat depots. Exercise regulates MAT, decreasing MAT quantity and diminishing the size of marrow adipocytes. The exercise regulation of marrow fat suggests that it bears some physiologic similarity to other white adipose depots. Moreover, increased MAT in obesity further suggests a similarity to white fat depots.

=== Ectopic fat ===
Ectopic fat is the storage of triglycerides in tissues other than adipose tissue, that are supposed to contain only small amounts of fat, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and pancreas. This can interfere with cellular functions and hence organ function and is associated with insulin resistance in type-2 diabetes. It is stored in relatively high amounts around the organs of the abdominal cavity, but is not to be confused with visceral fat.

The specific cause for the accumulation of ectopic fat is unknown. The cause is likely a combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors that are involved in excess energy intake and decreased physical activity. Substantial weight loss can reduce ectopic fat stores in all organs and this is associated with an improvement of the function of those organs.

In the latter case, non-invasive weight loss interventions like diet or exercise can decrease ectopic fat (particularly in heart and liver) in overweight or obese children and adults.

==Physiology==
Free fatty acids (FFAs) are liberated from lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and enter the adipocyte, where they are reassembled into triglycerides by esterifying them onto glycerol. Human fat tissue contains from 61% to 94% lipids, with obese and lean individuals tending towards the high and low ends of this range, respectively.

There is a constant flux of FFAs entering and leaving adipose tissue. The net direction of this flux is controlled by insulin and leptin—if insulin is elevated, then there is a net inward flux of FFA, and only when insulin is low can FFA leave adipose tissue. Insulin secretion is stimulated by high blood sugar, which results from consuming carbohydrates.

In humans, lipolysis (hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids) is controlled through the balanced control of lipolytic B-adrenergic receptors and a2A-adrenergic receptor-mediated antilipolysis.

Fat cells have an important physiological role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well as determining insulin resistance. Abdominal fat has a different metabolic profile—being more prone to induce insulin resistance. This explains to a large degree why central obesity is a marker of impaired glucose tolerance and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (even in the absence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension). Studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University (2009) discovered that individuals with higher stress have higher levels of visceral fat in their bodies. This suggests a possible cause-and-effect link between the two, wherein stress promotes the accumulation of visceral fat, which in turn causes hormonal and metabolic changes that contribute to heart disease and other health problems.

Recent advances in biotechnology have allowed for the harvesting of adult stem cells from adipose tissue, allowing stimulation of tissue regrowth using a patient&#x27;s own cells. In addition, adipose-derived stem cells from both human and animals reportedly can be efficiently reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells without the need for feeder cells. The use of a patient&#x27;s own cells reduces the chance of tissue rejection and avoids ethical issues associated with the use of human embryonic stem cells. A growing body of evidence also suggests that different fat depots (i.e. abdominal, omental, pericardial) yield adipose-derived stem cells with different characteristics. These depot-dependent features include proliferation rate, immunophenotype, differentiation potential, gene expression, as well as sensitivity to hypoxic culture conditions. Oxygen levels seem to play an important role on the metabolism and in general the function of adipose-derived stem cells.

Adipose tissue is a major peripheral source of aromatase in both males and females, contributing to the production of estradiol.

Adipose derived hormones include:
* Adiponectin
* Resistin
* Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
* TNFα
* IL-6
* Leptin
* Estradiol (E2)

Adipose tissues also secrete a type of cytokines (cell-to-cell signalling proteins) called adipokines (adipose cytokines), which play a role in obesity-associated complications. Perivascular adipose tissue releases adipokines such as adiponectin that affect the contractile function of the vessels that they surround.

===Brown fat===
Brown fat or brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized form of adipose tissue important for adaptive thermogenesis in humans and other mammals. BAT can generate heat by &quot;uncoupling&quot; the respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria through tissue-specific expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). BAT is primarily located around the neck and large blood vessels of the thorax, where it may effectively act in heat exchange. BAT is robustly activated upon cold exposure by the release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves that results in UCP1 activation.
Nearly half of the nerves present in adipose tissue are sensory neurons connected to the dorsal root ganglia.

BAT activation may also occur in response to overfeeding. UCP1 activity is stimulated by long chain fatty acids that are produced subsequent to β-adrenergic receptor activation. UCP1 is proposed to function as a fatty acid proton symporter, although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In contrast, UCP1 is inhibited by ATP, ADP, and GTP.

Attempts to simulate this process pharmacologically have so far been unsuccessful. Techniques to manipulate the differentiation of &quot;brown fat&quot; could become a mechanism for weight loss therapy in the future, encouraging the growth of tissue with this specialized metabolism without inducing it in other organs. A review on the eventual therapeutic targeting of brown fat to treat human obesity was published by Samuelson and Vidal-Puig in 2020.

Until recently, brown adipose tissue in humans was thought to be primarily limited to infants, but new evidence has overturned that belief. Metabolically active tissue with temperature responses similar to brown adipose was first reported in the neck and trunk of some human adults in 2007, and the presence of brown adipose in human adults was later verified histologically in the same anatomical regions.

===Beige fat and WAT browning===
Browning of WAT, also referred to as &quot;beiging&quot;, occurs when adipocytes within WAT depots develop features of BAT. Beige adipocytes take on a multilocular appearance (containing several lipid droplets) and increase expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In doing so, these normally energy-storing adipocytes become energy-releasing adipocytes.

The calorie-burning capacity of brown and beige fat has been extensively studied as research efforts focus on therapies targeted to treat obesity and diabetes. The drug 2,4-dinitrophenol, which also acts as a chemical uncoupler similarly to UCP1, was used for weight loss in the 1930s. However, it was quickly discontinued when excessive dosing led to adverse side effects including hyperthermia and death. β3-adrenergic agonists, like CL316,243, have also been developed and tested in humans. However, the use of such drugs has proven largely unsuccessful due to several challenges, including varying species receptor specificity and poor oral bioavailability.

Cold is a primary regulator of BAT processes and induces WAT browning. Browning in response to chronic cold exposure has been well documented and is a reversible process. A study in mice demonstrated that cold-induced browning can be completely reversed in 21 days, with measurable decreases in UCP1 seen within a 24-hour period. A study by Rosenwald et al. revealed that when the animals are re-exposed to a cold environment, the same adipocytes will adopt a beige phenotype, suggesting that beige adipocytes are retained.

Transcriptional regulators, as well as a growing number of other factors, regulate the induction of beige fat. Four regulators of transcription are central to WAT browning and serve as targets for many of the molecules known to influence this process. These include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), PRDM16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), and Early B-Cell Factor-2 (EBF2).

The list of molecules that influence browning has grown in direct proportion to the popularity of this topic and is constantly evolving as more knowledge is acquired. Among these molecules are irisin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which have been well-studied and are believed to be important regulators of browning. Irisin is secreted from muscle in response to exercise and has been shown to increase browning by acting on beige preadipocytes. FGF21, a hormone secreted mainly by the liver, has garnered a great deal of interest after being identified as a potent stimulator of glucose uptake and a browning regulator through its effects on PGC-1α. It is increased in BAT during cold exposure and is thought to aid in resistance to diet-induced obesity FGF21 may also be secreted in response to exercise and a low protein diet, although the latter has not been thoroughly investigated. Data from these studies suggest that environmental factors like diet and exercise may be important mediators of browning. In mice, it was found that beiging can occur through the production of methionine-enkephalin peptides by type 2 innate lymphoid cells in response to interleukin 33.

===Genomics and bioinformatics tools to study browning===
Due to the complex nature of adipose tissue and a growing list of browning regulatory molecules, great potential exists for the use of bioinformatics tools to improve study within this field. Studies of WAT browning have greatly benefited from advances in these techniques, as beige fat is rapidly gaining popularity as a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

DNA microarray is a bioinformatics tool used to quantify expression levels of various genes simultaneously, and has been used extensively in the study of adipose tissue. One such study used microarray analysis in conjunction with Ingenuity IPA software to look at changes in WAT and BAT gene expression when mice were exposed to temperatures of 28 and 6 °C. The most significantly up- and downregulated genes were then identified and used for analysis of differentially expressed pathways. It was discovered that many of the pathways upregulated in WAT after cold exposure are also highly expressed in BAT, such as oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. This suggests that some of the adipocytes switched to a beige phenotype at 6 °C. Mössenböck et al. also used microarray analysis to demonstrate that insulin deficiency inhibits the differentiation of beige adipocytes but does not disturb their capacity for browning. These two studies demonstrate the potential for the use of microarray in the study of WAT browning.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful computational tool that allows for the quantification of RNA expression for all genes within a sample. Incorporating RNA-Seq into browning studies is of great value, as it offers better specificity, sensitivity, and a more comprehensive overview of gene expression than other methods. RNA-Seq has been used in both human and mouse studies in an attempt characterize beige adipocytes according to their gene expression profiles and to identify potential therapeutic molecules that may induce the beige phenotype. One such study used RNA-Seq to compare gene expression profiles of WAT from wild-type (WT) mice and those overexpressing Early B-Cell Factor-2 (EBF2). WAT from the transgenic animals exhibited a brown fat gene program and had decreased WAT specific gene expression compared to the WT mice. Thus, EBF2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic molecule to induce beiging.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a method used to identify protein binding sites on DNA and assess histone modifications. This tool has enabled examination of epigenetic regulation of browning and helps elucidate the mechanisms by which protein-DNA interactions stimulate the differentiation of beige adipocytes. Studies observing the chromatin landscapes of beige adipocytes have found that adipogenesis of these cells results from the formation of cell specific chromatin landscapes, which regulate the transcriptional program and, ultimately, control differentiation. Using ChIP-seq in conjunction with other tools, recent studies have identified over 30 transcriptional and epigenetic factors that influence beige adipocyte development.

===Genetics===

The thrifty gene hypothesis (also called the famine hypothesis) states that in some populations the body would be more efficient at retaining fat in times of plenty, thereby endowing greater resistance to starvation in times of food scarcity. This hypothesis, originally advanced in the context of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, has been discredited by physical anthropologists, physiologists, and the original proponent of the idea himself with respect to that context, although according to its developer it remains &quot;as viable as when [it was] first advanced&quot; in other contexts.

In 1995, Jeffrey Friedman, in his residency at the Rockefeller University, together with Rudolph Leibel, Douglas Coleman et al. discovered the protein leptin that the genetically obese mouse lacked. Leptin is produced in the white adipose tissue and signals to the hypothalamus. When leptin levels drop, the body interprets this as a loss of energy, and hunger increases. Mice lacking this protein eat until they are four times their normal size.

Leptin, however, plays a different role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce leptin, leptin levels are elevated in the obese. However, hunger remains, and—when leptin levels drop due to weight loss—hunger increases. The drop of leptin is better viewed as a starvation signal than the rise of leptin as a satiety signal. However, elevated leptin in obesity is known as leptin resistance. The changes that occur in the hypothalamus to result in leptin resistance in obesity are currently the focus of obesity research.

Gene defects in the leptin gene (&quot;ob&quot;) are rare in human obesity. , only 14 individuals from five families have been identified worldwide who carry a mutated &quot;ob&quot; gene (one of which was the first ever identified cause of genetic obesity in humans)—two families of Pakistani origin living in the UK, one family living in Turkey, one in Egypt, and one in Austria—and two other families have been found that carry a mutated &quot;ob&quot; receptor. Others have been identified as genetically partially deficient in leptin, and, in these individuals, leptin levels on the low end of the normal range can predict obesity.

Several mutations of genes involving the melanocortins (used in brain signaling associated with appetite) and their receptors have also been identified as causing obesity in a larger portion of the population than leptin mutations.

===Physical properties===
Adipose tissue has a density of ~0.9 g/ml. Thus, a person with more adipose tissue will float more easily than a person of the same weight with more muscular tissue, since muscular tissue has a density of 1.06 g/ml.

==Body fat meter==

A body fat meter is a tool used to measure the body fat to weight ratio in the human body. Different meters use various methods to determine the ratio. They tend to under-read body fat percentage.

In contrast with clinical tools like DXA and underwater weighing, one relatively inexpensive type of body fat meter uses the principle of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in order to determine an individual&#x27;s body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person&#x27;s weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person&#x27;s body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis. This method is quick and readily accessible, but imprecise. Alternative methods are: skin fold methods using calipers, underwater weighing, whole body air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and DXA.

== Animal studies ==
Within the fat (adipose) tissue of CCR2 deficient mice, there is an increased number of eosinophils, greater alternative Macrophage activation, and a propensity towards type 2 cytokine expression. Furthermore, this effect was exaggerated when the mice became obese from a high fat diet.

<text>Amine Pierre Gemayel (, ; born 22 January 1942) is a Lebanese politician who served as the eighth president of Lebanon from 1982 to 1988.

Gemayel was born in Bikfaya to Pierre Gemayel, the founder of the Christian Kataeb Party (also known as the &quot;Phalanges&quot;). He worked as a lawyer, then was elected as a deputy for Northern Metn in 1970 by-election, following the death of his uncle, Maurice Gemayel, and once again in the 1972 general election. At the start of the Lebanese Civil War, the Phalanges were a member of the Lebanese Front, allied with Syria against the leftist National Movement. However, Syria became their enemy, while they started receiving the support of Israel. This phase saw the rise of Amine&#x27;s brother, Bachir, who had disputes with Amine about the military leadership, such as uniting the Christian militias by force. In 1982 Bachir was elected to presidency but was assassinated before taking office. 

Gemayel&#x27;s election was endorsed by the United States and Israel following the assassination of his brother, and he was elected on 23 September 1982. At the age of 40 years, Amine was the youngest president to take office. Gemayel re-organized the Lebanese Army, receiving support from the Multinational Force in Lebanon and despite fierce internal opposition, he reached the May 17 Agreement with Israel in 1983, which stipulated the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and ending the state of war between the two countries, but didn&#x27;t ratify it. Under his command, the army, allied with the Lebanese Forces, clashed with Jammoul, a Syrian-backed alliance led by the Druze Walid Jumblatt, in what is known as the Mountain War. By the end of the conflict, the government suffered heavy defeat, and lost control over wide areas of Mount Lebanon. It was followed by February 6 Intifada, where the army was expelled out of West Beirut, and disintegrated into sectarian groups.

As a result of heavy pressure, and the withdrawal of the multinational forces, Gemayel visited Damascus in 1984, and formed a national unity government, including members from the opposition, headed by Rashid Karami. He cancelled the May 17 Agreement, and appointed Michel Aoun as a Commander of the Armed Forces. In 1986, he helped Samir Geagea organize a coup against the leader of the Lebanese Forces Elie Hobeika, for signing the Tripartite Accord with Berri and Jumblatt. Following the assassination of Karami, he appointed Selim Hoss as acting Prime Minister. Right before his term expired, Gemayel dismissed the cabinet and formed a military government headed by Michel Aoun. Aoun then declared war on Syria but was defeated in 1990, marking the end of the civil war and the implementation of the Taef Agreement. Gemayel moved to Switzerland and later France, starting a self-imposed exile.

In 2000, Gemayel returned to Lebanon, and organized opposition to Syria, and the leadership of the Phalangist Party. He joined the Qornet Shehwan Gathering, and participated in the Cedar Revolution following the assassination of Rafic Hariri. In 2006, Pierre Gemayel, his son, who was a member of the parliament, was assassinated. He ran in the by-election, but lost against a Free Patriotic candidate. His other son, Samy, succeeded him as president of the Phalangist Party.

==Early life and education==
Gemayel descends from a Maronite Christian family (the Gemayels) with a long tradition in Lebanon. The Gemayel family are originally from the northern region of Mount Lebanon. His ancestors settled in the town of Bikfayya, 25 kilometers northeast of Beirut, in the mid-16th century. Born in the Lebanese town of Bikfaya on 22 January 1942, Amine Gemayel is the eldest son of Pierre Gemayel, founder of the Kataeb Party and his wife Genevieve. He has two sisters and a brother, late Bachir Gemayel. His grandfather was forced to leave Lebanon in the early 20th century as a result of his opposition to the Ottoman Empire and therefore, had to spend several years living in Egypt. Gemayel&#x27;s great uncle, Antoine, traveled to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as a political representative of the Maronite Christian community in Lebanon.

Gemayel obtained a law degree from the St. Joseph University in Beirut in 1965.

==Career==
Amine Gemayel began his career after his graduation practicing as an attorney in 1965. He then concentrated on building up his family&#x27;s newspaper business. In a 1970 by-election, he was elected to succeed his deceased uncle, Maurice Gemayel, as a member of the National Assembly; he defeated Fuad Lahoud by a margin of 54% to 41%. In 1972, in the last election to be held for 20 years, he was reelected by a large margin. 

While his younger brother Bashir was regarded as a political radical, espousing the expulsion of Palestinian guerrillas from Lebanese soil and a radical overhaul of the political system, and hinting at a possible peace settlement with Israel, Amine Gemayel was considered more moderate. Always a consensus politician, he avoided, at least in his pre-presidential years, alienating Muslim politicians as his brother had done. When Bashir Gemayel was assassinated by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, therefore, Amine was regarded as a natural choice to bring together both the supporters of his slain brother, and his Muslim opponents.

On 21 September 1982, he was elected the president of the republic. His term in office ended on 22 September 1988 (six years as per the Lebanese Constitution). He then joined the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University as a fellow and lecturer (1988–1989). He is affiliated with the University of Maryland as a distinguished visiting professor. From 1990 to 30 July 2000, he resided in Paris as an exiled leader of the opposition, and lectured extensively on Lebanon and the Middle East in various countries worldwide. Since July 2000, he has been living in Lebanon where he pursues his political agenda.

==Presidency==
Gemayel never promised the Israelis anything in order to be elected president, but he promised that he would follow the path of his brother Bashir whatever that path was. He left his post in the Kataeb Party after being elected president. Once elected, he refused to meet any Israeli official. With foreign armies occupying two-thirds of the country (Syria in the north and east, Israel in the south), and private armies independent of government control occupying most of the rest, Gemayel&#x27;s government lacked any real power. His efforts to reach a peace settlement with Israel were stymied by Syria and by Muslim politicians at home. His government found itself largely unable to collect income tax, as warlords controlling the ports and major cities pocketed the tax take themselves. Many criticized Gemayel for not moving decisively enough to assert the authority of the government, but others have pointed out that with most of the country under foreign occupation, there was little that he could do. He managed to keep a semblance of constitutional order.
This order began to unravel in 1988. Gemayel, whose term was due to end on 23 September, was constitutionally barred from reelection. Amine Gemayel opposed Dany Chamoun for the presidential elections, a man known for his strong anti-Syrian views and the son of former president Camille Chamoun, or General Michel Aoun, the commander of the army. Chamoun and Aoun were both unacceptable to Syria and to Muslim politicians in Lebanon. A constitutional crisis developed. Fifteen minutes before the expiry of his term, Gemayel appointed Aoun to the post of prime minister, who takes on the role of acting president if the presidency is vacant. He did so to preserve the tradition that the president, and by implication anyone acting in that role, should be a Maronite Christian , thereby going against the tradition of reserving the premiership for a Lebanese Sunni Muslim. Muslim politicians and warlords refused to accept the Aoun government, instead recognizing a rival government of Selim Hoss, whom Gemayel had dismissed in favour of Aoun.

When Amine Gemayel took office, Lebanon was torn by Israel&#x27;s invasion of June 1982, and its subsequent occupation of large areas of Lebanese territory. This made the withdrawal of Israeli troops a top priority on his political agenda. As head of state, he set himself three main objectives which still form the basis of his political activity today: (1) Reestablishing the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon; (2) Maintaining an effective dialogue between Lebanon&#x27;s different communities and (3) Restoring and modernizing the institutions of the state.

In 1984, Amine Gemayel dissolved the &quot;Arab Deterrence Force&quot;, which provided the legal framework for Syria&#x27;s military presence since 1976; and in 1985, he refused to ratify the so-called &quot;Damascus Agreement&quot; brokered by the Syrian government between the fending Lebanese chiefs of militias, which aimed at disintegrating any independent decision-making process in Lebanon.

In 1987, he promulgated the law annulling the &quot;Cairo Agreement&quot; of 1969, which authorized the PLO to use Lebanon as a base for military operations against Israel, disregarding Lebanese sovereignty.

=== The Puma scandal ===
Amine Gemayel was believed to be behind the purchase of what were supposed to be new, French-made Puma helicopters. That was in 1983. Then the aircraft were discovered to be used and Ukrainian-made, making them worth far less than original price (184 million francs, a rough equivalent of $80 million at the time). The deal was signed in Beirut in July of the year 1983 by Lebanese Defense Minister Issam Khoury and the “Société Francaise de Vente et Financement de Materiels Terrestres et Maritimes” (SOFRANTEM). Gemayel denied that he had any connection with the affair. According to the minutes of Parliament&#x27;s session, published in the Official Gazette in 1994, Parliament held the French government responsible for the financial losses as a result of breaking the contract. Officials also held then Army Commander General Ibrahim Tannous responsible for “neglect” because an illegal military deal was sealed during his term of office. The minutes showed that Parliament also held Gemayel responsible, and that it referred the case to the state prosecutor for further investigation. This was all brought up in 2002 as part of investigations by a special parliamentary committee into former President Amin Gemayel&#x27;s role in the Puma aircraft sale.

===Other activities===
Apart from his political activities, Amine Gemayel established, in 1976, the &quot;INMA Foundation&quot;, which coordinates several institutions dealing with social, political and economic issues concerning Lebanon and the Middle East. He also founded &quot;Beit-al-Mustakbal&quot;, (the house of the future), a think-tank and research center which published &quot;Haliyyat&quot;, a quarterly journal edited in Arabic, French and English, comprising a chronology of the main events in the area, press reports, and a series of essays. In addition, he started a French-language daily newspaper entitled &quot;Le Reveil&quot;.

==Post-presidential years==

Gemayel started a self-imposed exile for the next twelve years, living variously in Switzerland, France, and the United States. At first, he claimed that he was threatened by Syria, but he later published in his memoirs that Geagea threatened him with personal harm.

In 1989, he joined Harvard University&#x27;s Center for International Affairs. He also lectured at the University of Maryland, College Park. On 30 July 2000, however, he returned to Lebanon and began to organize the opposition to the government of President Émile Lahoud, whom he regarded as a Syrian puppet. Unable to regain control of the then pro-Syrian dominated official Kataeb Party, he founded a new party, al-Qaeda al-Kataebiya, which claimed to be the true successor to the old Kataeb Party founded by his father. He also joined the Qornet Chehwan Gathering, a group of anti-government Christian politicians.

In 2003, Amine Gemayel attempted to act as an intermediary between U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Although his efforts to forestall the ensuing Iraq War were not successful, they fuelled speculation that he might be a candidate for Secretary General of the United Nations when Kofi Annan&#x27;s term expired. 

After the Cedar Revolution the Kataeb factions were united under the leadership of Gemayel. After Gemayel&#x27;s son Pierre was assassinated in November 2006, Amine ran for his late son&#x27;s seat. Amine lost by a small margin to an unknown candidate presented by Michel Aoun as a member of the Free Patriotic Movement.

In February 2008, Gemayel was appointed the president of the Phalange or Kataeb Party, replacing Karim Pakradouni, who resigned from office in 2007.

==Personal life==
Gemayel married Joyce Tyan in December 1967. They had a daughter, Nicole, and two sons, Pierre and Sami. Pierre Gemayel was elected to Parliament in 2000, appointed to the Cabinet in 2005. He was assassinated by unidentified assailants in Jdeideh, a Beirut suburb, on 21 November 2006. Amine Gemayel angrily blamed Syria for the murder of his son. He is fluent in French and English.

<doc id="419097" wikidata="Q23544" url="?curid=419097" title="Checkbox">
<text>A checkbox (check box, tickbox, tick box) is a graphical widget that allows the user to make a binary choice, i.e. a choice between one of two possible mutually exclusive options. For example, the user may have to answer &#x27;yes&#x27; (checked) or &#x27;no&#x27; (not checked) on a simple yes/no question.

Checkboxes are shown as empty boxes when unchecked, and with a tick or cross inside (depending on the graphical user interface) when checked. A caption describing the meaning of the checkbox is normally shown adjacent to the checkbox. Inverting the state of a checkbox is done by clicking the mouse on the box, or the caption, or by using a keyboard shortcut, such as the space bar.

Often, a series of checkboxes is presented, each with a binary choice between two options. The user may then select several of the choices. This is contrasted with the radio button, in which only a single option is selectable from several mutually-exclusive choices.

Checkboxes may be disabled (indicated &quot;greyed out&quot;) to inform the user of their existence and possible use despite momentary unavailability.

==Tri-state checkbox==

Some applications use checkboxes that allow an indeterminate state in addition to the two provided by a normal checkbox. This third state is shown as a square or dash in the checkbox, and indicates that its state is neither checked nor unchecked. This is most often used when the checkbox is tied to a collection of items in mixed states. The indeterminate state cannot usually be selected by the user, and switches to a checked state when activated.

For example, a checkbox presented to select files to send via FTP might use a tree view so that files can be selected one at a time, or by folder. If only some of the files in a folder are selected, then the checkbox for that folder would be indeterminate. Clicking on this indeterminate checkbox would select all or, less commonly, none of the contained files. Continuing to click on the checkbox would alternate between checked (all sub-directories and files selected) and unchecked (no sub-directories or files selected).

Some tri-state checkbox implementations allow the user to toggle among all states, including the indeterminate state, by remembering the mixed state of the items in the collection. This serves as an undo feature.

==Not actionable==
Setting or clearing (&quot;unclicking&quot;) a checkbox changes the checkbox&#x27;s state with no other side-effects. Violating this guideline by associating additional actions with the change of state frequently confuses users, because they are used to configuring data in entry controls such as text boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes and then invoking an action control such as a push button to initiate the action to process the data.

One common exception is to enable or display additional user input elements whose relevance depends on the checkbox state. In other situations toggle switch is typically used instead of a checkbox.

==HTML==
In web forms, the HTML element is used to display a checkbox.

<text>Llanes (the Concejo de Llanes, Conceyu de Llanes in Asturian language) is a municipality of the province of Asturias, in northern Spain. Stretching for about 30 km along the coast at the extreme east of the province, Llanes is bounded to the south by the high ridge of the limestone Sierra del Cuera, which rises to over 1,100 m. The region is part of the &quot;Costa Verde&quot; (Green Coast) of Spain, which is known for its spectacular coastal scenery, with 32 white sand beaches, and mountains covered with a deep green mantle. Llanes lies to the north of the Picos de Europa, a mountain range whose geology is almost entirely of limestone karst.

Most of the inhabitants of the district live on the coastal plain, on which the largest town is Llanes itself, with a population of about 4,000 out of the total for the district of about 13,000. The folklore, food, and fiestas of the region are famous for their colour and history.

== Town ==



Llanes is a traditional fishing port, with an active harbour and many notable monuments and traditions; 
Parts of the surviving town walls date to 1206 with a medieval Tower of Llanes remaining. There is a romanic-gothic Basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary. One plaque commemorates the 65 sailors from Llanes who sailed on the three ships it fitted out for the Spanish Armada in 1588 (the Santa Ana, the San Nicolas, and the Santelmo). Another plaque commemorates the September 26, 1517 visit of Emperor Charles V who stayed for two nights, when on his way to Valladolid to be crowned King of Castile.
In the 1990s the landmark old Theatre (Teatro Benevente), built as part of the main bridge over the river, was pulled down.

Llanes economy is boosted by tourists mostly from the rest of Spain in the summer. The town has traditional shops and restaurants, both in and around the town, and the &quot;zona de copas&quot; is lively at night in summer. Three beaches and a cliff-top walk, the &quot;Paseo de San Pedro&quot;, add to the coastal atmosphere. Nearby is the Playa de Gulpiyuri.
==Parishes==
Llanes is divided into 28 parishes:

== Mountains ==
From all of the district of Llanes the view to the south is dominated by the limestone mountain wall, which rises steeply to 744 m at L&#x27;Abá.
The ridge forming the wall shields the view of the higher Sierra del Cuera above, of which the highest point (in Llanes) is La Peña Blanca, 1177 m. Between the two ridges there are hidden valleys, draining into cave systems. The largest of these valleys is La Llosa de Viango. Unlike the heights of the Picos de Europa further to the south, these valleys are green and pastoral. The mountains are part of the Cordillera Cantábrica, which runs across most of the north and northwest of Spain.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

From September 6, 1937 to September 22, 1937, 5,000 men of the Republican forces held off over 33,000 Nationalists, in this area, in an epic resistance which became known as the Battle of El Mazuco.

== Caves ==
The district contains numerous caves, including a site of archaeological interest at Nueva, and the Cueva Bolado ({{coord|43|24|04|N|4|45|51|W}}) near La Pereda which also contains ancient art as well as open passages.

There are also several significant &#x27;wild&#x27; cave systems, including

* the Bolugo-Caldueñín system under El Mazuco (the &quot;Río Belugas&quot;, which sinks at ({{coord|43|22|45|N|4|51|03|W}}) and resurges at {{coord|43|22|48|N|4|51|54|W}})
* the Rales system ({{coord|43|24|43|N|4|53|39|W}})
* El Cuevón de Pruneda, near Purón ({{coord|43|22|39|N|4|43|23|W}}).

These systems were first systematically explored by speleologists from the Oxford University Cave Club and from Speleogroup.

In addition, it is suspected that there is a significant cave system underlying La Llosa de Viango.

== Fiestas ==
In Llanes itself, the patron saint of the town, &quot;Nuestra Señora del Conceyu&quot;, is celebrated with a Fiesta on 15 August. In addition, there are three big summer Fiestas in the town: 22 July La Magdalena, 16 August San Roque, and 8 September La Guía. These Fiestas are independently organized by three groups, known as &quot;Bandos&quot;, with followers in the Llanes population; these have a long and well-known rivalry, and each tries every year to outdo the others and stage the best festivities.

Outside the town, the various parishes and localities in the district celebrate the usual diversity of Fiestas in honour of their patron saints, with emphasis on La Hoguera (&quot;The bonfire&quot;), which consists of the felling of a mountain eucalyptus which is then erected in the village after removing the branches and bark. This is celebrated in several villages, including Celorio, Balmori, and Pancar (where they carry out the entire ritual without the help of their neighbours).

Also famous is the Noche de las Brujas of Barro (a very traditional and popular celebration centred on Asturian mythology), as is the celebration of Santa Ana, the patron saint of Naves, thanks to the free concert given by popular musicians.

<text>An organ system is a biological system consisting of a group of organs that work together to perform one or more functions. Each organ has a specialized role in an organism body, and is made up of distinct tissues.

== Humans ==
Main article: &quot;List of systems of the human body&quot;

There are 11 distinct organ systems in human beings, which form the basis of human anatomy and physiology. The 11 organ systems: the respiratory system, digestive and excretory system, circulatory system, urinary system, integumentary system, skeletal system, muscular system, endocrine system, lymphatic system, nervous system, and reproductive system. There are other systems in the body that are not organ systems—for example, the immune system protects the organism from infection, but it is not an organ system since it is not composed of organs. Some organs are in more than one system—for example, the nose is in the respiratory system and also serves as a sensory organ in the nervous system; the testes and ovaries are both part of the reproductive and endocrine systems.
==Other animals==
Other animals have similar organ systems to humans although simpler animals may have a lot of organs in an organ system or even fewer organ systems.

== Plants ==

Plants have two major organs systems. Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists stems, leaves, and the reproductive parts of the plant (flowers and fruits). The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground.

<text>A radio button or option button is a graphical control element that allows the user to choose only one of a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. The singular property of a radio button makes it distinct from checkboxes, where the user can select and unselect any number of items.

Radio buttons are arranged in groups of two or more and displayed on screen as, for example, a list of circular holes that can contain white space (for unselected) or a dot (for selected). Each radio button is normally accompanied by a label describing the choice that the radio button represents. The choices are mutually exclusive; when the user selects a radio button, any previously selected radio button in the same group becomes deselected (making it so only one can be selected). Selecting a radio button is done by clicking the mouse on (or touching the screen over) the button, or the caption, or by using a keyboard shortcut.

== Etymology ==

Radio buttons were named after the physical buttons used on older radios to select preset stations – when one of the buttons was pressed, other buttons would pop out, leaving the pressed button the only button in the &quot;pushed in&quot; position.

==HTML==
In web forms, the HTML element is used to display a radio button. Example:

&lt;form&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;season&quot; value=&quot;winter&quot; id=&quot;winter&quot; checked&gt;
 &lt;label for=&quot;winter&quot;&gt;Winter&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;season&quot; value=&quot;spring&quot; id=&quot;spring&quot;&gt;
 &lt;label for=&quot;spring&quot;&gt;Spring&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;season&quot; value=&quot;summer&quot; id=&quot;summer&quot;&gt;
 &lt;label for=&quot;summer&quot;&gt;Summer&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;season&quot; value=&quot;autumn&quot; id=&quot;autumn&quot;&gt;
 &lt;label for=&quot;autumn&quot;&gt;Autumn&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
A group of attributes is defined by name. In one group, only one radio button can be chosen.

==Unicode==
Version 6 of the Unicode standard includes a character designated to represent a radio button, (🔘) at code point 128,280 (U+1F518), found in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs section. Similar characters are the mathematical operator as well as and .

The font Wingdings 2 contains at position 153 and 158 glyphs that look like radio buttons.

<text>Casio Cassiopeia was the brand name of a PDA manufactured by Casio. It used Windows CE (later versions running Windows PocketPC/Windows Mobile) as the Operating system. Casio was one of the first manufacturers of PDAs, developing at the beginning small pocket-sized computers with keyboards and grayscale displays and subsequently moving to smaller units in response to customer demand.

It was quickly discovered that most consumers wanted smaller devices, so the Palm-size PCs were developed. Japanese models of these units differ in both model number as well as appearance. The E-5x and/or E-5xx models are Japanese versions, colored blue instead of silver. The following versions were developed; A21-S for Student, A22-T for Teachers, A-23G for German (with QWERTZ keyboard), A-20F for French (with AZERTY keyboard).

Casio always advertised the fact that their devices could be updated. Casio decided it would not issue an update for the E-100 and E-105, and a lot of owners of the devices complained. Because of the complaints, Casio offered to update the devices to the newest version of the Operating system if the owners sent in the device and paid a fee. Since the operating system was stored in ROM and not flash memory, the only way to upgrade was by replacing the ROM.

<text>Michel de Ghelderode (born Adémar Adolphe Louis Martens; 3 April 1898 – 1 April 1962) was an avant-garde Belgian dramatist, from Flanders, who spoke and wrote in French. His works often dealt with the extremes of human experience, from death and degradation to religious exaltation. He wrote plays and short stories, and was a noted letter writer.

==Personal life==

Michel de Ghelderode was born in Brussels, Belgium in 1898. Ghelderode&#x27;s father, Henri-Louis Martens, was employed as a royal archivist, a line of work later to be pursued by young Ghelderode. The author&#x27;s mother, née Jeanne-Marie Rans, was a former postulant for holy orders; even after bearing four children, of whom Ghelderode was the youngest. She retained evident traces of her erstwhile vocation that would strongly influence the mature Ghelderode&#x27;s dramatic work: One of Mme Martens&#x27;s remembered &quot;spiritual tales,&quot; concerning a child mistakenly buried alive who remained strangely marked by death even after her rescue, inspired most of the plot and characters of Ghelderode&#x27;s &quot;Mademoiselle Jaire&quot; (1934) written when the author was in his mid-thirties.

He also served in the military from 1919 – 1921, and in 1924 married Jeanne-Françoise Gérard (d. 1980).

Ghelderode became increasingly reclusive from 1930 onwards and was chronically ill with asthma during his late thirties. Frequently suffering from poor health, around the age of sixteen, while pursuing his studies at the Institut St.-Louis in Brussels, he fell gravely ill with typhus. He would retain for the rest of his life the vision of &quot;a Lady&quot; who materialized at his bedside to utter the words; &quot;not now, sixty-three.&quot; Ghelderode in fact died two days short of what would have been his sixty-fourth birthday in 1962. He is buried in the Laeken Cemetery, Brussels.

==Influences==
Ghelderode&#x27;s ideas and vision of the theatre is in remarkable accord with ideas Antonin Artaud expressed in his manifesto &quot;The Theatre and Its Double&quot;, which was originally published 1 February 1938. Both men saw theatre as having the potential to express the human unconscious with its dream-like hallucinatory images and dynamic appetites. And both Artaud and Ghelderode found inspiration in the fantastical, dream-like images and ideas found in the works of the Flemish painters Bosch and Brueghel. Ghelderode referred to Brueghel as his &quot;père nourricier&quot; (foster father), wrote plays closely based on Brueghel&#x27;s paintings, and said of Brueghel&#x27;s &quot;Dulle Griet&quot; that it &quot;was not only a wonderful painting but offered a vision of the world, a philosophy.&quot; Artaud independently discusses in detail the very same painting (Brueghel&#x27;s &quot;Dulle Griet&quot;) in &quot;The Theatre and Its Double&quot; to illustrate his own ideas regarding the theatre of cruelty, as he references the &quot;nightmares of Flemish painting&quot;.

Ghelderode, who was born in Flanders, expressed a great appreciation for Flemish folk traditions and culture, which permeates his plays and stories. Ghelderode has said, &quot;The Fleming lives in a hallucinatory world…. But our eye remains meticulously realistic; the keen awareness of the surface and of the great mysteries beyond – there you have the Fleming since even before Brueghel. … The ridiculous outside and the wretched, sublime eternal quandary of the soul … I am not a revolutionary; I am merely writing in the tradition of my race.&quot;

Ghelderode&#x27;s influences include puppet theater, Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte, the medieval world of Flanders, the Flemish painters Bosch, Bruegel, Jacob Jordaens and the Teniers, along with the Belgian artist James Ensor, painter of the macabre, and the novelist Georges Eekhoud.
A number of Ghelderode&#x27;s plays are based on the paintings by Breughel. His play &quot;The Blind Men&quot; (&quot;Les Aveugles&quot;, 1933) is derived from Brueghel&#x27;s &quot;The Parable of the Blind&quot;, &quot;The Magpie on the Gallows&quot; (La Pie sur le Gibet, 1935) is derived from Breughel&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Way to the Gallows&quot;, and &quot;The Strange Rider&quot; (&quot;Le Cavalier Bizarre&quot;, 1920) is not based on a particular painting, but, as the preface states, it is inspired by Breugel.

==Career==

A prolific writer, Ghelderode wrote more than 60 plays, a hundred stories, a number of articles on art and folklore and more than 20,000 letters.

He began writing plays in French in 1916. &quot;La mort regarde à la fenêtre&quot; (Death Looks in at the Window) was produced in 1918, followed by &quot;Le repas des fauves&quot; (The Beasts&#x27; Meal) in 1919. In 1921 and 1922 he was a professor at the Institut Dupuich but resigned because of ill health. The following year he worked as a bookseller. In 1923 Ghelderode earned the post of archives editor in the Communale de Schaerbeek, where he worked in a variety of capacities until 1945. In 1924 he began contributing to such publications as &quot;La Flandre littéraire&quot; and &quot;La Renaissance d&#x27;Occident&quot; and wrote plays for the puppet theater &quot;Les Marionnettes de la Renaissance d&#x27;Occident&quot;. Ghelderode began staging plays again in 1925, working with the Dutch producer Johan de Meester, a collaboration which lasted until 1930. &quot;Escurial&quot; (1927) is one of his most frequently performed plays. Widely recognized as one of his finest achievements, it exhibits German Expressionism and Symbolist influences. He wrote &quot;Pantagleize&quot; (1929) expressly for the Flemish comedian Renaat Verheyen, who died aged twenty-six, shortly after appearing in the title role.

Ghelderode completely gave up writing plays in 1939. Between 1946 and 1953 he wrote for &quot;Le Journal de Bruges&quot;.In Paris during 1949, productions of Ghederode&#x27;s plays, especially &quot;Fastes d&#x27;enfer&quot; (Chronicles of Hell), caused huge uproar. Some theatre-goers were excited and some were furious. It achieved for Ghelderode a &quot;succès de scandal&quot;.

==Themes and style==
Ghelderode is the creator of a fantastic and disturbing, often macabre, grotesque and cruel world filled with mannequins, puppets, devils, masks, skeletons, religious paraphernalia, and mysterious old women. His works create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere although they rarely contain anything explicitly scary.

A strong anticlerical streak runs through many of Ghelderode&#x27;s plays, mitigated by a spirituality which stops short of true belief. Throughout Ghelderode&#x27;s theatrical universe, religion is more often honored than adhered to. Sensuality is another dominant characteristic prominent in almost all of Ghelderode&#x27;s plays, often in unattractive forms. Gluttony and heavy drinking loom large, as does lust, often represented by hag-like female characters with suggestive names.

According to Oscar G. Brockett, Ghelderode&#x27;s works resemble those of Alfred Jarry, the surrealists and the expressionists, and his theories are similar to those of Antonin Artaud. Through nearly all of his plays runs his perception of human beings as creatures whose flesh overpowers spirit. &quot;Corruption, death and cruelty are always near the surface [of Ghelderode&#x27;s work], although behind them lurks an implied criticism of degradation and materialism and a call to repentance.&quot;

Ghelderode was one of the first dramatists to exploit the idea of total theatre—that is, drama in which every sort of appeal is made to the eye, the ear, and the emotions in order to stir the intellect. As a pioneer of total theatre, Ghelderode exerted a powerful influence on the history of the French theatre. Although many of his plays have since been translated into English, his works are infrequently performed in English-speaking countries. Writing in October 1957 on the occasion of the first of his plays to be seen publicly in England, Ghelderode declared –

In 1957, Luc de Heusch and Jean Raine made a 22-minute film about Ghelderode. He appears near its end, in the location of the Royal Theatre Toone, the sixth and last in a dynasty of marionette theatres in Brussels.

==Pseudonyms==
Ghelderode was born with the name Adhémar-Adolphe-Louis Martens, and changed his name by Royal Deed. He also wrote under the pen-names Philostene Costenoble, Jac Nolan, and Babylas.

==Adaptations==

Ghelderode&#x27;s &quot;La Balade du Grand Macabre&quot; (1934) served as libretto for György Ligeti&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; (1974–77. Revised 1996).

<text>The Temple of Mercy and Charity () is a Mariavite cathedral in Płock in central Poland. It is located near the Vistula River.

==Significance==
The Temple is the religious center of the Mariavite Church and contains the tomb of its founder Feliksa Kozłowska, as well as a memorial plaque commemorating its first leader Jan Maria Michał Kowalski. It is also the focus of pilgrimages by followers of the Mariavite Church. The main religious celebration occurs on August 15, the date of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which also coincides with the consecration of the church.

== History==
The church was built on the site of a small manor with two annexes which was purchased in 1902 by the movement&#x27;s founder Feliksa Kozłowska. The temple&#x27;s construction took place from 1911 to 1914 and was financed chiefly from collections from the Mariavite community.

== Architecture ==
The Temple was designed in English Neo-Gothic style, according to instructions issued by Feliksa Kozłowska and conveyed by Bishop Maria Michał Kowalski. All technical aspects of the plans were supervised and corrected by two experienced architect and engineer Mariavite priests, Wacław Przysiecki and Feliks Szymanowski.

The church itself is built on an E- shaped plan to symbolize the word Eucharist. Perched on top of the main dome is a gigantic monstrance adorned by four angels, each measuring almost 4 feet in height. The following sentence is carved underneath: &quot;Adorujmy Chrystusa Króla panującego nad narodami&quot;, which in English translates as &quot;Let us adore Christ the King who reigneth over all nations&quot;. On top each of its three slim steeples are crowns, with three more on the central steeple and one on each of the side ones.

The exterior is grey/blue in colour, whereas inside, it is full of natural light and dazzling white. The interior is free of any excessive ornamentation and has no side altars. The focus of the building is to direct attention solely towards the main altar in the centre of the temple. A gilded baldaquin rests on top of four pillars. A papal tiara and the Keys of St. Peter are fixed to the baldaquin&#x27;s front to symbolize that in the Mariavite Church, the highest authority is in Jesus, continuously present in the church signified by the fervent adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. On either side of the altar are Gothic stalls where Mariavite clergy sit during religious services. The doors, pews and floors of the Temple of Mercy and Charity are all carved in solid oak.

In addition to the remains of Feliksa Kozłowska, the Temple crypt also houses the tombs of several Mariavite bishops.

<doc id="419117" wikidata="Q5318258" url="?curid=419117" title="Dwight Watson (farmer)">
<text>Dwight Ware Watson (September 28, 1952 - December 7, 2024), dubbed the &quot;Tractor Man&quot; in the media, is a tobacco farmer from Whitakers, North Carolina, who, in March 2003, brought much of Washington, D.C. to a standstill for two days when he drove a tractor into the pond in the Constitution Gardens area of the National Mall and claimed to have explosives. The standoff with federal and local law enforcement ended when Watson surrendered. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of making a false threat to detonate explosives and for destroying federal property, and served 16 months in prison.

==Background==
Watson was previously an MP with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg. He had increasing difficulty making a living on his tobacco farm in rural Nash County, North Carolina, which had been in his family for five generations. Watson blamed federal tobacco policies for his difficulties, and was said to have engaged in hour-long harangues on this issue at such places as the local grocery store. In 1999, Watson reportedly made his first protest visit to D.C. with his tractor, but left after driving around the city for a while without incident. Following a drought in his state and the cutting of his crop quota by half, Watson finally decided that he was incapable of affording the farm and again drove to D.C. the second weekend of March 2003. (Never Split the Difference, Chapter 10, Chris Voss

==Standoff==

On March 17, 2003, at around 12:30 p.m. (EST), Watson, wearing a military helmet and displaying an upside down American flag, drove a John Deere tractor towing two vehicles into a shallow pond in Constitution Gardens near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Watson said that he was protesting the cutting of federal tobacco subsidies (on which he blamed his own farm&#x27;s failure) and the government&#x27;s treatment of Gulf War veterans. According to law enforcement, Watson claimed to have explosives that he would detonate if police approached him.

In response to Watson&#x27;s threats, the United States Park Police cordoned off a large area on the Mall extending from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument. Several nearby government offices were also evacuated and major traffic arteries in the area were closed, which caused massive jams and paralyzed traffic across the Washington metropolitan area for four consecutive rush hours.

A SWAT team composed of around 200 FBI and Park Police officers kept the pond surrounded as Watson drove his tractor around in circles, dug up part of an island in the pond, and communicated with authorities and the media on a cell phone. Watson finally surrendered to federal authorities on March 19 after a 48-hour standoff. No explosives were found.

==Trial and sentencing==
Watson was subsequently charged with the federal crimes of making a false threat to detonate explosives and for destroying federal property, and stood trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Watson initially represented himself, and unsuccessfully tried to subpoena such figures as Bill Clinton and Jesse Ventura, whom the judge refused as irrelevant to his case. Watson testified at trial that his comments about having an &quot;organophosphate bomb&quot; only referred to the two cans of Raid bug bombs he had in the tractor, which he threatened to use if he did not get media coverage only because he wished to demonstrate the harmfulness of insecticides. In his pretrial interrogation by law enforcement, however, he had acknowledged that he intentionally let law enforcement continue to believe that he actually had explosives. The jury deliberated for less than an hour, and returned a guilty verdict on both charges on September 26, 2003.

Watson&#x27;s sentencing was repeatedly delayed, particularly for a psychiatric evaluation ordered by the presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who questioned Watson&#x27;s mental health. Judge Jackson finally sentenced Watson to six years, far above the minimum sentence under the federal guidelines of sixteen months, based on what he saw as Watson&#x27;s menacing conduct and the chaos his standoff had caused, and as a deterrent against civil protesters tying up law enforcement and terrorizing the city. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot; (2004) that judges could not impose stiffer sentences based on facts that a jury had not decided, Judge Jackson reduced the sentence to sixteen months on June 30, 2004. As Watson had already served over fifteen months by that time, he was released the next day and returned to his family and farm in North Carolina.

Prosecutors challenged the judge&#x27;s reduction of Watson&#x27;s sentence, and an appellate court agreed that the reduction was inaccurate and probably too lenient. Nearly four years later, Watson went back to court before District Court Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan for reconsideration of his sentence on February 12, 2008, which was an uncommon situation for the federal court after a defendant had served his time and had been released. Although he believed Watson deserved another three years in prison, Judge Hogan declined to give Watson more prison time. Noting that it was only the second occasion he had departed from federal sentencing guidelines since &quot;Blakely&quot; was decided, Hogan stated that there would be little benefit to the public in returning him to prison, particularly since Watson was employed and taking care of his mentally ill sister.

==Reactions==
The fact that one man had managed to disrupt so much of the nation&#x27;s capital and hold federal law enforcement officers at bay for two days raised many concerns over the vulnerability of Washington to terrorist attacks, especially coming mere months after the Beltway sniper attacks and coinciding with the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Many criticized the authorities for their passive handling of Watson, as he was even left alone to sleep aboard his tractor during the two-day standoff. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; columnist Tony Blankley wrote that &quot;[o]n the eve of a multi-billion dollar, high-technology war, our security perimeter has been penetrated and downtown traffic has come to a standstill. ... The Park Police should just drag Dwight and his John Deere out of the pond, slap him on the wrist and get ready for the real enemies in our midst.&quot; Others argued that the threat of a possible explosion on the Mall required patience and a peaceful resolution.

In a statement issued the same day that Watson surrendered, North Carolina Congressman Bob Etheridge stated that while he did not condone Watson&#x27;s actions, the farmer personified &quot;the growing pain and frustration felt in tobacco country...We must not miss this opportunity to address the very real problems of tobacco country and rural America.&quot; Others, including other farmers in his home state, considered Watson as a patriot who simply used civil disobedience to air legitimate complaints. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported at the time of Watson&#x27;s sentencing that a &quot;Web site started by tobacco farmers and family members describes Watson as an &#x27;American hero&#x27; who called attention to the difficulties of tobacco farmers&quot;.

After the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Blakely&quot;, the reduction of Watson&#x27;s sentence was cited by U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch as an example of the &quot;havoc&quot; caused by that decision.

==Popular culture==
In episode 23 of the American crime drama television series &quot;Lie To Me&quot; called &quot;Tractor Man&quot;, a protesting farmer parks his explosives-packed tractor near the US Treasury building.

The negotiations with Dwight Watson are at the center of one of the classes in negotiation in the MasterClass series by former FBI negotiator Chris Voss.

<text>Jordanów, is a town in southern Poland, on the Skawa river. As of 2018, the town had a population of 5,360.

==History==
Jordanów was founded in 1564 by Spytek Wawrzyniec Jordan on the salt road from Kraków and Wieliczka to Orava and Hungary. In 1581 it got a right to organize annual fairs, which in 17th century became famous in south regions of the Crown. Main goods traded there were linen, cattle and salt. Since 1999, Jordanów has been situated in Sucha County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship. It was previously in Nowy Sącz Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

Jordanów is the oldest town on the territory of Sucha Beskidzka County. Its history dates back to a royal privilege, issued in 1564 by King Zygmunt August, upon which Spytek Jordan of Zakliczyn was allowed to found a new town. Jordan himself was a rich and influential nobleman, a starosta of Kraków and Crown podskarbi.

The town of Jordanów was located on the grounds of the village of Malejowa, with Magdeburg rights charter. Spytek Jordan, who was regarded as an enlightened man, planned the town square with a town hall (1571), hoping that Jordanów would emerge as an important trade and craft center. After Spytko&#x27;s death, Jordanów belonged to his wife Anna Sieniawska, and then to several noble families. In 1576, Stefan Batory confirmed Jordanów&#x27;s charter, allowing for two fairs a year. Jordanów prospered, with inns, restaurants, artisans, and warehouses of salt and Hungarian wine, a very popular commodity in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Following the first partition of Poland (1772) Jordanów was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until 1918. During Austrian rule the town declined, with the situation slowly improving after 1884, when a railroad line with a station was completed. In the Second Polish Republic, Jordanów was a spa, nicknamed Green Town. The town, however, remained poor, with high unemployment and no industry.

In early September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, Jordanów was burned by the Wehrmacht (see also Battle of Jordanów). Out of 400 houses, 270 were completely destroyed. The town was once again burned in January 1945, and for its sufferings, in 1984 was awarded the Order of the Cross of Grunwald.

==Expenses scandal==

Winterton was one of a number of Government Ministers who secretly repaid back some of expenses money which they had wrongly claimed. In the row over MPs&#x27; expenses, it was claimed she used taxpayers&#x27; cash to soundproof the bedroom of her south London flat. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the minister claimed a total of £86,277 over four years in additional costs allowance – close to the total allowed under Parliament&#x27;s green book.

==Honours==
In June 2006, she was appointed a member of the Privy Council, and she was sworn in on 19 July 2006.

She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours.

After standing down as an MP, Winterton was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. She was created &quot;Baroness Winterton of Doncaster, of Doncaster in the County of South Yorkshire&quot;, on 13 August 2024.

<doc id="419135" wikidata="Q806915" url="?curid=419135" title="All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku">
<text>is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Yuzo Takada. It was serialized in &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; for only three issues in 1991, with the three published stories later compiled in a single volume collection in December 1997. The story begins when genius inventor Kyūsaku Natsume transplants the brain of a cat found by his son Ryūnosuke on Christmas Eve, into a schoolgirl android that he created and subsequently stole from his former employer, Mishima Heavy Industries (owned by his estranged wife and Ryūnosuke&#x27;s mother, Akiko Natsume). The result, Nuku Nuku (also known as Atsuko Natsume), is a &quot;nekomusume&quot; or cat girl. The manga was licensed by ADV Manga and published as a single volume on August 24, 2004.

&quot;Cat Girl Nuku Nuku&quot; has been adapted into two OVA series and one anime television series. All three anime adaptations were also licensed in North America by ADV Films. An English language version of the OVA was released by Crusader Video in the United Kingdom on VHS featuring regional accents. Discotek Media has since received the license to the OVAs, TV series and its &quot;Dash!!&quot; spin-off.

==Plot==
The plot generally focuses on the custody battle for Ryūnosuke and the attempts by Akiko and Mishima Heavy Industries to reclaim Nuku Nuku&#x27;s body, which often involves amusingly larger-than-life battles between Nuku Nuku and military hardware produced by Mishima Heavy Industries.

Two episodes also deal with a one-sided war between Nuku Nuku and another android named Eimi Yoshikawa, who suffers from an over-the-top inferiority complex and envies Nuku Nuku&#x27;s more stable design. As it stands, Eimi was made after her and seeks to transfer her programming into Nuku Nuku to ditch her own body, which Akiko calls &quot;a piece of junk&quot;. In spite of Eimi being more emotionally unstable than Nuku Nuku, both their fights end in a draw.

While taking class, a so-called &quot;evil corporation&quot; called Mishima Industries (same as before) decides to test their robotic washing machine in the school ground, which unsurprisingly goes berserk, against which Nuku Nuku has to defend her classmates.

Kyūsaku then resorts to sabotaging his daughter&#x27;s performance, which doesn&#x27;t work and she wins. Later it&#x27;s revealed that she participated in the event to earn the huge prize money for her father&#x27;s underfunded research projects.

Futaba, Nuku Nuku&#x27;s class rep &amp; strict friend has been brainwashed to be an aggressive Mishima Industries product promoter through a hypnotizing effect inducing book by a bookstore keeper she deemed as a crush and Nuku Nuku has to stop this.

=== Characters ===
Atsuko &quot;Nuku Nuku&quot; Natsume

Voiced by: Megumi Hayashibara (Japanese), Allison Keith (English)

The de facto protagonist and title character. Nuku Nuku started out as just a stray cat Ryūnosuke stumbled upon taking a leak while on the run with his father Kyūsaku after retrieving (stealing) a prototype android of Kyūsaku&#x27;s own design to keep it from being sold off to the military by Ryū&#x27;s mother Akiko. The stray cat was shot in the crossfire short by Akiko&#x27;s henchwomen quickly after Ryū was allowed to keep the cat as a Christmas present. In a moment of brilliance Kyūsaku put the dying cat&#x27;s brain into the android, giving the feline sapience and the android emotions. Nuku Nuku considers Ryū her brother and Akiko and Kyūsaku her parents though she is fully aware of her origins. Nearly indestructible, she acts as Ryū&#x27;s, and her own, bodyguard keeping from being reclaimed by the near dementedly overprotective Akiko. Relatively new to the world, Nuku Nuku acts childish at times, and is still easily distracted by stereotypical feline things like mice, but shows a sincere desire to evolve and grow. In spite of her situations, she harbors no ill will towards Akiko or just about anyone, but is more than willing to resort to violence when push comes to shove. To help create the pretense of a normal life she attends high school.

Ryūnosuke Natsume

Voiced by: Kazue Ikura (Japanese), Kira Vincent-Davis (English)

The son of a brilliant if absent minded scientist and the over protective CEO of Japan&#x27;s number one weapon&#x27;s manufacturer, Ryū manages to take it all in stride and enjoys the times where he&#x27;s able to squeeze in a normal life and quality time with either of his parents. He loves Nuku Nuku as a sister, but is agitated when his father brushes off her blunders as &#x27;just being a cat&#x27; when at the same time granting her the respect and responsibilities of a human being. Ryū was the one who found the stray cat that would eventually become Nuku Nuku. Ryū is fully aware of how warped his mother can be, but still cares for her all the same (but still prefers to live with his father over his mother&#x27;s smothering affection).

Kyūsaku Natsume

Voiced by: Akira Kamiya (Japanese), Andrew Klimko (English)

The brilliant, if quite eccentric, scientist who created a prototype android with funding from his wife&#x27;s company. However, with the amount of cash being dumped into the project he realized that his android would be sold off as a weapon. Having no desire to aid his wife&#x27;s weapon&#x27;s research he fled with his son in tow. He and his wife are not technically divorced and will still chat and bicker like any married couple when the chance arises. He created add-ons for Nuku Nuku on at least one occasion to outfit her for unique situations.

Akiko Natsume

Voiced by: Saeko Shimazu (Japanese), Kelly Manison (English)

CEO of Japan&#x27;s biggest military contractor, and an obsessively protective mother, Akiko&#x27;s greatest goals are to reclaim Ryūnosuke from her husband and to capture Nuku Nuku in order to reverse engineer her. Because of the delicate nature of the information about Nuku Nuku&#x27;s existence she does not try to legally reclaim Ryū, but instead relies on numerous abduction attempts by her two henchwomen Arisa and Kyōko. In spite of her borderline-demented attitude and love of firepower, she does indeed love Ryūnosuke and only wants what&#x27;s best for him. That said, all else is business to her, and is frighteningly ruthless and manipulative to get what she wants and was even willing to turn a blind eye to Nuku Nuku when the cat girl was working at a restaurant her company owned.

Eimi Yoshikawa

Voiced by: Mika Kanai (Japanese), Cynthia Martinez (English)

An android built in the image of the deceased granddaughter of Kyūsaku Natsume&#x27;s mentor, Eimi is emotionally, mentally, and physically unstable. Built in the image of a girl around Ryū&#x27;s age, Eimi&#x27;s activation resulted in an explosion that killed her grandfather, leaving her legally the property of Akiko&#x27;s company. Suffering from multiple sources of psychological trauma on top of (or maybe because of) her faulty design, Eimi&#x27;s single fixation is taking Nuku Nuku&#x27;s body for herself. (Eimi&#x27;s own body doomed to detonate if pushed beyond its limit due a faulty or perhaps non-existent cooling system.) Eimi openly admits she has no idea how to download her OS into Nuku Nuku&#x27;s hardware (not knowing Nuku Nuku&#x27;s brain is biological and not software driven like Eimi&#x27;s own), but is driven by a lack of a better plan and a superiority-inferiority complex she suffers from Nuku Nuku. Nuku Nuku for her part would love nothing more than to be Eimi&#x27;s friend. Eimi admitted to having feelings for Ryū, but brushed off her own emotions as meaningless since like everything else about her is just a software parlor trick, and wrote an apology to Ryū for feeling such &#x27;fake&#x27; emotions towards him. A drama queen and an irrepressible hot-head, Eimi is able to think ahead and be clever but often lets her own impatience get the better of her.

Arisa Sono and Kyōko Ariyoshi

Arisa voiced by: Aya Hisakawa (Japanese), Kaytha Coker (English)

Kyōko voiced by: Akiko Hiramatsu (Japanese), Tiffany Grant (English)

Akiko&#x27;s two loyal henchwomen, they spearhead the attacks on Nuku Nuku and frequently suffer the consequences. Arisa is the more violent of the two and prefers to use weapons in order to get her way, something which Kyōko tries to restrain.

<doc id="419136" wikidata="Q1056771" url="?curid=419136" title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">
<text>The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) is an international patent law treaty, concluded in 1970. It provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.

A single filing of a PCT application is made with a Receiving Office (RO) in one language. It then results in a search performed by an International Searching Authority (ISA), accompanied by a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention, which is the subject of the application. It is optionally followed by a preliminary examination, performed by an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). Finally, the relevant national or regional authorities administer matters related to the examination of application (if provided by national law) and issuance of patent.

A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, since there is no such thing as an &quot;international patent&quot;, and the grant of patent is a prerogative of each national or regional authority. In other words, a PCT application, which establishes a filing date in all contracting states, must be followed up with the step of entering into national or regional phases to proceed towards grant of one or more patents. The PCT procedure essentially leads to a standard national or regional patent application, which may be granted or rejected according to applicable law, in each jurisdiction in which a patent is desired.

The contracting states, the states which are parties to the PCT, constitute the International Patent Cooperation Union.

==History==

The Washington Diplomatic Conference on the Patent Cooperation Treaty was held in Washington from 25 May to 19 June 1970. The Patent Cooperation Treaty was signed on the last day of the conference on 19 June 1970. The Treaty entered into force on 24 January 1978, initially with 18 contracting states. The first international applications were filed on 1 June 1978. The Treaty was subsequently amended in 1979, and modified in 1984 and 2001. As of December 2022, PCT membership consisted of 157 contracting states. It was expected that by the end of 2020 the total number of PCT applications filed since the system became operational in 1978 would reach 4 million.

==Parties==

Any contracting state to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property can become a member of the PCT. A majority of the world&#x27;s countries are parties to the PCT, including all of the major industrialized countries (with a few exceptions, notably Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela and Pakistan). As of 26 December 2022, there were 157 contracting states to the PCT.

==Procedure==

The main advantages of the PCT procedure, also referred to as the international procedure, are that (a) it allows the filing of a single patent application, replacing the need for filing a multiplicity of separate applications, with a procedure taking place in a predictable way; (b) the international search and, optionally, the international preliminary examination &quot;give applicants a better basis for deciding whether and in which countries to further pursue their applications&quot;, thus allowing &quot;for better management of patent portfolios and the avoidance of unnecessary expenses&quot;; and (c) it allows the deferral of national processing.

A PCT application (also called &quot;international patent application&quot;) has two phases. The first phase is the international phase in which patent protection is pending under a single patent application filed with the patent office of a contracting state of the PCT. The second phase is the national and regional phase which follows the international phase in which rights are continued by filing necessary documents with the patent offices of separate contracting states of the PCT. A PCT application, as such, is not an actual request that a patent be granted, and it is not converted into one unless and until it enters the &quot;national phase&quot;.

===Filing===
The first step of the procedure consists in filing an &quot;international (patent) application&quot; with a competent patent office, called a &quot;Receiving Office&quot; (RO). This application is called an &quot;international application&quot; or simply a &quot;PCT application&quot; since it neither results in an international patent nor in a PCT patent, neither of which exists. The PCT application needs to be filed in one language only, although a translation of the application may be required for the international search and the international publication, depending on the language of filing and the competent or chosen International Searching Authority.

At least one applicant (either a physical or legal person) must be a national or resident of a contracting state to the PCT; otherwise, no PCT filing date is accorded. If a PCT filing date is erroneously accorded, the Receiving Office may, within four months from the filing date, declare that the application should be considered withdrawn. The requirement that at least one applicant must be a national or resident of a contracting state to the PCT needs, however, &quot;only to be complied with at the time of filing the international application. Later changes in the applicant&#x27;s country of residence (or nationality) ... have no consequence on the validity of the international application itself.&quot;

In most member states, the applicant or at least one of the applicants of the application is required to be a national or resident of the state of the receiving office where the application is filed. Applicants from any contracting state may file a PCT application at the International Bureau in Geneva, subject to national security provisions.

Upon filing of the PCT application, all contracting states are automatically designated. Subject to reservations made by any contracting state, a PCT application fulfilling the requirements of the treaty and accorded a PCT filing date has the effect of a regular national application in each designated state as of the PCT filing date, which date is considered to be the actual filing date in each designated State.

===Search and written opinion===
A search or &quot;international search&quot; is then made by an authorized international searching authority (ISA) to find the most relevant prior art documents regarding the claimed subject matter. The search results in an international search report (ISR), together with a written opinion regarding patentability. The ISA(s) that the applicant can choose depends on the receiving Office with which the applicant filed the international application.&lt;ref name=&quot;Practical advice 06/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the most selected ISAs were the European Patent Office (EPO) (with 37.7% of all ISRs issued), followed by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) (20.7%) and the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) (14.8%).

The ISA must establish the ISR and its accompanying written within &quot;three months from the receipt of the search copy by the International Searching Authority, or nine months from the priority date, whichever time limit expires later.&quot;

The ISR is published together with the PCT application (or as soon as possible afterwards). The written opinion is initially confidential, but unless it is superseded by an &quot;International Preliminary Examination Report&quot; (see optional examination, below), it is made available in the form of an &quot;International Preliminary Report on Patentability&quot; (Chapter I of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or IPRP Chapter I), within 30 months of the filing date or a priority date, if any. If the ISR is not in English, it is translated into English for publication. A designated Office may require a translation of the IPRP Chapter I into English.

The international search report can help the applicant decide whether it would be worthwhile seeking national protection, and if so, in how many countries, as fees and other expenses, including translation costs, must be paid to enter the national phase in each country. Yet another advantage of filing a PCT application under the PCT is that many national patent authorities will rely on the international search report (although the PCT does not obligate them to do so) instead of performing a prior art search themselves, and the applicant may thus be able to save search fees.

In addition to the compulsory international search, at least one optional supplementary international search may also be carried out by participating International Searching Authorities, upon request by the applicant and payment of corresponding fees. The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of seeing new prior art being cited in the subsequent national phases. A supplementary international search is said to allow applicants to obtain an additional search report &quot;taking into account the growing linguistic diversity of the prior art being found&quot;. In 2009 and 2010, the demand for supplementary international searches was relatively low.

===Publication===

The PCT application is published by the International Bureau at the WIPO, based in Geneva, Switzerland, in one of the ten &quot;languages of publication&quot;: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. The publication normally takes place promptly after 18 months from the filing date or, if a priority is claimed, from the earliest priority date. There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, a PCT application may be published earlier if the applicant requests early publication. Secondly, if 18 months after the priority date, the PCT application designates only the United States, then the application is not automatically published.

From the publication of the PCT application until 28 months after the priority date, any third party may file observations regarding the novelty and inventive step of the invention. The observations may be submitted anonymously, and no fee is due for filing such observations.

An international application may also be withdrawn to prevent its publication. To do so, the International Bureau (IB) &quot;must receive the notice of withdrawal of the application before the corresponding technical preparations for publication are completed&quot;.

===Optional examination===
An &quot;international preliminary examination&quot; may optionally be requested (&quot;demanded&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Practical-Advice-04/2010&quot;&gt; &quot;Factors to be considered when deciding whether or not to file a demand for international preliminary examination&quot; (Views of David Reed), Practical Advice, PCT Newsletter No. 04/2010, page 8ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The international preliminary examination is conducted by an authorized &quot;International Preliminary Examination Authority&quot; (IPEA) and its objective is &quot;to formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable&quot;. This results in an &quot;International Preliminary Examination Report&quot; (IPER). Since 2004, the IPER bears the title &quot;&quot;international preliminary report on patentability (Chapter II of the Patent Cooperation Treaty)&quot; (commonly abbreviated &quot;IPRP Chapter II&quot;&quot;). The filing of a demand for international preliminary examination, which must be done within a time limit, is subject to the payment of a &quot;handling fee&quot; for the benefit of the International Bureau and a &quot;preliminary examination fee&quot; for the benefit of the IPEA. The cost of filing a demand varies depending on the IPEA used by the applicant. The IPEA(s) that the applicant can choose however depends on the receiving Office with which the applicant filed the PCT application (the same applies to ISAs).

If the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority (ISA) is positive, &quot;there is little value to be obtained from filing a demand&quot;. However, &quot;[for] cases where the written opinion of the ISA contains negative findings, the savings in the applicant&#x27;s/agent&#x27;s time and, where applicable, agent&#x27;s fees, required by multiple responses to national offices may well justify the use of the Chapter II procedure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Practical-Advice-05/2010&quot;&gt; &quot;Factors to be considered when deciding whether or not to file a demand for international preliminary examination – Part 2&quot; (Views of David Reed), Practical Advice, PCT Newsletter No. 05/2010, page 8ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for an international preliminary examination also gives the applicant an opportunity to amend the claims, description and drawings. Otherwise, the applicant can only modify the claims once within two months from the time of the ISR has been transmitted. There are many advantages, such as cost and effort savings (&quot;as well as possibly shortened pendency/faster grants&quot;), in receiving a favourable IPRP Chapter II, i.e. a favourable report following an international preliminary examination. For instance, national offices &quot;with a smaller examining staff and those without examiners tend to rely more heavily on the results in the IPRP Chapter II&quot;.

When an international preliminary examination is demanded, the contracting states for which the examination is demanded are called &quot;elected Offices&quot; (under &quot;Chapter II&quot;), otherwise they are called &quot;designated Offices&quot; (under &quot;Chapter I&quot;). The &quot;election&quot; of a contracting state correspondingly means electing it when demanding (requesting) the examination.

An alternative to the filing of a demand for international preliminary examination is to file informal comments in response to the written opinion established by the ISA. These informal comments are not published. The informal comments should be submitted to the International Bureau (IB), and not to the ISA or the IPEA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Practical-Advice-10/2004&quot;&gt;&quot;PCT Newsletter&quot; 10/2004: Practical Advice. Consulted on 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They are kept in the file of the PCT application and, in the case where no demand is filed, forwarded to the designated offices, which are free to require a translation of the informal comments.

===Substantive conditions of patentability===
The PCT does not make any specific provision concerning the types of invention which may be the subject of an international application. Rules 39 and 67 permit International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authorities not to carry out search and examination on certain types of subject matter, such as scientific and mathematical theories, methods of doing business and computer programs to the extent that the Authority is not equipped to carry out a search or international preliminary examination concerning such programs. However, this does not affect the issue of whether the invention is patentable under the laws of the contracting states, as &quot;[n]othing in [the PCT] and the Regulations is intended to be construed as prescribing anything that would limit the freedom of each contracting state to prescribe such substantive conditions of patentability as it desires.&quot;

===National and regional phases===
Finally, at 30 months from the filing date of the PCT application or from the earliest priority date of the application if a priority is claimed, the international phase ends and the PCT application enters in national and regional phase. However, any national law may fix time limits which expire later than 30 months. For instance, it is possible to enter the European regional phase at 31 months from the earliest priority date. National and regional phases can also be started earlier on the express request of the applicant, even before publication of the international application.

If the entry into national or regional phase is not performed within the prescribed time limit, the PCT application generally ceases to have the effect of a national or regional application.

==Statistics==

The millionth PCT application was filed at the end of 2004, whereas the two millionth application was filed in 2011. The first ever decline in the number of filed PCT applications in over 30 years occurred in 2009, with a 4.5 percent drop compared to 2008. In 2013, about 205,000 international applications were filed, making 2013 the first year during which more than 200,000 PCT applications were filed in one year. The 3 millionth PCT application was published on 2 February 2017, and the 5 millionth PCT application was published in 2024.

Applications in 2018 were filed by users from 127 countries. The United States of America continued to be the largest source of applications, followed by China, Japan, Germany, and the Republic of Korea. Applications from China have grown at the fastest rate, rising to 21.1% of all applications in 2018. The top individual filer of applications in 2018 was Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., which filed 5,405 applications, followed by Mitsubishi Electric with 2,812 applications, Intel with 2,499 applications, Qualcomm with 2,404 applications, and ZTE with 2,080 applications. Countries located in Asia were the source of 50.5% of all PCT applications in 2018. Applicants in Europe (24.5%) and North America (23.1%) were the other major sources of filings. The combined share for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Oceania amounted to 1.7% of total PCT filings.

In 2019, China surpassed the United States to become the largest user of the PCT.

<text>Sir Geoffrey Robert Clifton-Brown (born 23 March 1953) is a British Conservative Party politician who has served as a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1992. He has represented North Cotswolds since 2024, having previously represented Cirencester and Tewkesbury, then The Cotswolds.

==Early life and career==
Geoffrey Clifton-Brown was born on 23 March 1953 in Cambridge, the eldest of four children of farmer Robert Lawrence Clifton-Brown (1929–2016), of Maltings Farmhouse, Haverhill, Suffolk, a councillor and mayor of St Edmundsbury, Suffolk, and (Florence) Elizabeth Lindsay (1926–2006), granddaughter of Sir Edmund Hoyle Vestey, 1st Baronet.

He was privately educated, first at Tormore School, in Deal, Kent and then at Eton College. He then studied at the Royal Agricultural College where he qualified as a chartered surveyor in 1975. He began his career as a graduate estate surveyor at the Property Services Agency in Dorchester and, later in 1975, became an investment surveyor with Jones Lang Wootton. He became the vice chairman of the Norfolk North Conservative Association in 1984. He was elected as Constituency Chairman in 1986, a position he held until he resigned in 1991 in order to stand for election as a Conservative candidate.

==Parliamentary career==
During 1991, Clifton-Brown was selected as the candidate for the then Conservative parliamentary constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury, following the retirement of the former Cabinet minister Nicholas Ridley. He won the seat at the 1992 general election with 55.6% of the vote and a majority of 16,058, both slightly higher than at the 1987 general election. Clfiton-Brown made his maiden speech on 12 June 1992.

When newly elected Clifton-Brown became a member of the Environment Select Committee, where he remained until 1995. He was then appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

The constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury was abolished, but Clifton-Brown contested and was elected for the newly drawn constituency of Cotswold at the 1997 general election. He won with 46.4% of the vote, a decrease of 8% from 1992, and a majority of 11,965, down from 16,058.

<text>James Mackay Cousins (born 23 February 1944) is an English Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne Central from 1987 to 2010.

==Early life==
Cousins was educated at the City of London School, New College, Oxford and the LSE. While at Oxford University, Cousins was a leading member of the university&#x27;s Liberal Club. During the 1960s, he authored a pamphlet rejecting the &quot;new&quot; Labour of the Harold Wilson era. From 1967 to 1972 he worked in industrial relations and as a research worker in industry. From 1972 to 1982 he was a research worker in Urban Affairs and City Labour Markets. From 1982 to 1987, he was a lecturer at Sunderland Polytechnic.

==Parliamentary career==
On the party&#x27;s rebel left, Cousins briefly served on the party&#x27;s front bench in a foreign affairs portfolio before being stripped of his position along with fellow frontbencher Ann Clwyd in 1995. The two MPs had been on a fact-finding tour of Kurdistan, at that time being ravaged by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and failed to return in time for a crucial Commons vote. As a key ally of the then Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Cousins was still hopeful of a ministerial job when Labour won the election in 1997, but his hopes were dashed and instead he became an influential member of the backbench Treasury Select Committee.

Although Cousins has been described as a member of Labour&#x27;s so-called awkward squad, his politics and indeed his personality are in reality more complex. He voted against the war in Iraq in 2003 and opposed the introduction of tuition fees in 2004, but on other matters - such as Tony Blair&#x27;s reforms of the National Health Service, he remained loyal.

The Liberal Democrats made a determined effort to target Cousins&#x27; Newcastle Central constituency in the 2005 general election, having taken control of Newcastle City Council the previous year, and Cousins saw his majority reduce from 11,605 to under 4,000. While unsuccessful in defeating Cousins, this result represented one of the largest swings in the country, possibly attributed to Liberal Democrat candidate Greg Stone&#x27;s student-oriented campaign which focused on issues such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq and Top-up fees. In June 2009, Cousins announced that he would not be fighting to maintain his seat in the House of Commons at the next general election citing the health of his wife as the reason.

==Personal life==
He is married to Anne Elizabeth. They have two sons, and a stepson and step daughter.

<doc id="419142" wikidata="Q6121041" url="?curid=419142" title="Jacqui Lait">
<text>Jacqueline Anne Harkness Lait (born 16 December 1947) is a British Conservative Party politician and former Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituencies of Hastings and Rye (1992–1997) and Beckenham (1997–2010).

==Early life==
Lait was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, attending Paisley Grammar School and the University of Strathclyde, where she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business management. After graduating, Lait worked in public relations for the jute industry in Dundee later working for the television news agency Visnews. Lait worked for the Government Information Service and later the Department of Employment in 1974. In 1980, Lait joined the Chemical Industries Association as parliamentary adviser. She has also run her own parliamentary consultancy.

==Political career==
Lait was a candidate for Strathclyde West for the 1984 European elections and the following year stood in the by-election for Tyne Bridge where she finished in third place behind David Clelland and Rod Kenyon. She was selected as the Conservative candidate for Hastings and Rye in April 1991.

Lait won the Hastings and Rye seat in the 1992 general election and in 1996 became the first female Conservative Whip. She lost her seat at the 1997 general election, following a dispute with local fishermen, but later in the same year was elected MP for Beckenham via a by-election after the resignation of Piers Merchant.

Upon the election of the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith in September 2001, Lait was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. The position had been vacant since 1997 as the Conservatives had no representation in the UK Parliament from Scottish constituencies. Peter Duncan was elected to a Scottish constituency in the 2001 election and he took over as Shadow Scottish Secretary from Lait in 2003 when she became shadow Home Affairs Minister. A reshuffle after the 2005 general election saw her appointed as shadow Minister for London. Two years later, she was handed the additional duties of shadow Minister for Planning.

She over-claimed for the mortgage interest on her second home, and was ordered to pay back over £7,000.

Lait stood down as an MP at the 2010 general election.

==Personal life==
Lait is married to Peter Jones, former leader of East Sussex County Council.

<text>Stanley Kwan (traditional Chinese: 關錦鵬; simplified Chinese: 关锦鹏); born 9 October 1957) is a Hong Kong film director and producer.

Kwan landed a job at TVB after receiving a mass communications degree at Hong Kong Baptist College. Kwan&#x27;s first film was &quot;Women&quot; (1985), which starred Chow Yun-fat, and was a big box-office success.

Kwan&#x27;s films often deal sympathetically with the plight of women and their struggles with romantic affairs of the heart. &quot;Rouge&quot; (1987), &quot;Full Moon in New York&quot; (1989), &quot;Center Stage&quot; (1992; a.k.a. &quot;Actress&quot;), a biopic on silent film star Ruan Lingyu and &quot;Everlasting Regret&quot; (2005), are all such typical Kwan films. &quot;Red Rose White Rose&quot; (1994) is an adaptation of a novella of the same name by Eileen Chang. The film was entered into the 45th Berlin International Film Festival. His 1998 film &quot;Hold You Tight&quot; won the Alfred Bauer Prize and Teddy Award at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival.

Kwan came out as a gay man in 1996 in &quot;Yang ± Yin&quot;, his documentary looking at the history of Chinese-language film through the prism of gender roles and sexuality. He is one of the few openly gay directors in Asia and one of the very few to have worked on these themes. His &quot;Lan Yu&quot; (2001) adapts a gay love story originally published on the Internet.

Kwan is also an occasional lecturer at the City University of Hong Kong, where he teaches directing and writing to students.

<doc id="419145" wikidata="Q7843065" url="?curid=419145" title="Trio (TV network)">
<text>Trio (stylized as TR!O) was an American cable and satellite television network.

Trio went on the air in 1994, then originally owned and operated jointly by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Power Broadcasting Inc. (a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada) along with 24-hour international news channel Newsworld International. The channel served as a venue for airing the CBC&#x27;s arts, culture and entertainment programming in the U.S. It was sold to USA Networks in 2000, and was subsequently transferred to Vivendi Universal and later NBC Universal.

With the slogan, &quot;pop, culture, TV&quot;, Trio programming under Vivendi/NBC Universal ownership focused on television as a cultural tool and art form.

In January 2005, Trio was dropped from DirecTV, eliminating about two-thirds of the homes that could receive the network. On November 21, 2005, NBC Universal announced that the Trio brand would be transferred to a broadband Internet TV initiative under the Bravotv.com banner on January 1, 2006. Cable and satellite providers still carrying Trio were offered a new NBC Universal cable network instead, called Sleuth, which was renamed Cloo in 2011 and continued on until its sudden closure on February 1, 2017.

===&quot;Brilliant But Cancelled&quot;===
This was the umbrella title under which Trio aired repeats of series that had very short lives on mainstream broadcast television, yet were still considered to be programming that &quot;broke the mold&quot; of what was normally expected from the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks. Series that appeared under the &quot;Brilliant But Cancelled&quot; umbrella included:

* &quot;Action&quot;
* &quot;Bakersfield P.D.&quot;
* &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;
* &quot;Charlie Cobb: Nice Night for a Hanging&quot;
* &quot;Diner&quot; (pilot)
* &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;
* &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;
* &quot;EZ Streets&quot;
* &quot;Fargo&quot; (pilot)
* &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot;
* &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;
* &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (pilot)
* &quot;Lookwell&quot; (pilot)
* &quot;Now and Again&quot;
* &quot;Parenthood&quot;
* &quot;Profit&quot;
* &quot;The PJs&quot;
* &quot;United States&quot;

&quot;Brilliant But Cancelled&quot; was later used by Universal as a title for a series of DVDs that feature samples of short-lived series. Two of these have been released—one being a sampler of short-lived crime drama series, while the other was selected episodes of &quot;EZ Streets&quot;.

===&quot;Flops&quot;===
Special airing of shows that flopped.

* &quot;Cop Rock&quot;
* &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;
* &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot;
(&quot;The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer&quot; was supposed to air, but was pulled due to the controversial nature of the program, which played for laughs the relationship between a black nobleman and President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War).

<doc id="419155" wikidata="Q215006" url="?curid=419155" title="Otto Hermann Kahn">
<text>Otto Hermann Kahn (February 21, 1867 – March 29, 1934) was an American investment banker, collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts. Kahn was a well-known figure, appearing on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and was sometimes referred to as the &quot;King of New York&quot;. In business, he was best known as a partner at Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. who reorganized and consolidated railroads. In his personal life, he was a great patron of the arts, where among things, he served as the chairman of the Metropolitan Opera.

==Life and career==

Otto was born on February 21, 1867, in Mannheim, Grand Duchy of Baden, and raised there, by his Jewish parents, Emma (née Eberstadt) and Bernard Kahn. His father had been among the refugees to the United States after the revolution of 1848 and had become an American citizen, but later returned to Germany. Kahn was educated in a gymnasium in Mannheim.

Kahn&#x27;s ambition was to be a musician, and he learned to play several instruments before he graduated from the gymnasium. His father however, had other plans. As one of eight children, a career path had been laid for each one. At 17, Kahn was placed in a bank at Karlsruhe as a junior clerk, where he remained for three years, advancing until he was thoroughly grounded in the intricacies of finance. He then served for a year in the Kaiser&#x27;s hussars.

On leaving the army he went to the London agency of Deutsche Bank, where he remained for five years. He displayed such unusual talent that he became second-in-command when he had been there but a comparatively short time. The English mode of life, both political and social, appealed to him, and eventually he became a naturalized British subject.

In 1893, he accepted an offer from Speyer and Company of New York and went to the United States, where he spent the rest of his life. On January 8, 1896, Kahn married Addie Wolff and following the couple&#x27;s year-long tour of Europe, Kahn joined Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. in New York City, where his father-in-law, Abraham Wolff, was a partner. In 1917, Kahn gave up his British nationality and became a United States citizen.

Besides his father-in-law, Kahn&#x27;s other partners included Jacob Schiff, himself the son-in-law of Solomon Loeb, who co-founded the firm, and Paul and Felix Warburg. Almost immediately, Kahn was thrown into contact with railroad builder E. H. Harriman. In spite of sharply-defined differences in temperament and method, they became as brothers. In opposition to Harriman&#x27;s gruff, domineering, aggressive manner in business, was Kahn&#x27;s calm, good-humored, almost gentle deportment. Kahn, although only 30 years old, took an almost equal part with Harriman in the gigantic task of reorganizing the Union Pacific Railroad, a work which in its early stages had been handled by Schiff. Kahn proved his ability to analyze mathematically and scientifically the problems that were constantly presented.

Kahn was soon to be acknowledged as the ablest reorganizer of railroads in the United States. He applied himself to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, the Wabash Railroad, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, the Texas and Pacific Railroad, and other systems. More than once, his prompt and vigorous action averted an imminent financial panic. A notable instance was his rescuing from collapse the Pearson-Farquhar syndicate when it found itself in deep water in an attempt to combine several existing lines of railroad into a South American transcontinental system.

When American International Corporation was forming, Kahn took an active part in the negotiations, and brought them to a successful issue. Kahn conducted negotiations which led to the opening of the doors of the Paris Bourse to American securities and the listing there of $50,000,000 Pennsylvania bonds in 1906, the first official listing of American securities in Paris. Also he had a large share later in the negotiations which resulted in the issue by Kuhn, Loeb and Company of $50,000,000 of City of Paris bonds and $60,000,000 Bordeaux-Lyons and Marseilles bonds.

In 1933, the smooth and affable Kahn successfully disarmed antagonism against members of the banking community during four days of testimony before the United States Senate&#x27;s Pecora Commission hearings into the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The Senate&#x27;s lead counsel Ferdinand Pecora wrote on page 293 in his 1939 memoir &quot;Wall Street Under Oath&quot; about Otto Kahn: &quot;No suaver, more fluent, and more diplomatic advocate could be conceived. If anyone could succeed in presenting the customs and functions of the private bankers in a favorable and prepossessing light, it was he.&quot;

Kahn was a trustee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and of Rutgers College. He was a director in numerous corporations, including the Equitable Trust Co. of New York and the Union Pacific Railroad.

During the last years of Kahn&#x27;s life he became increasingly frail and suffered from arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure and attacks of angina pectoris. On March 29, 1934, following lunch in the private dining room of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., Kahn suffered a massive heart attack and died, aged 67. Funeral services were held in the music room of his Long Island estate, followed by a burial in nearby St. John&#x27;s Memorial Cemetery.

== Patron of the arts ==
An extremely wealthy financier, Kahn was president and chairman of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Opera, vice-president of the New York Philharmonic and treasurer for the American Federation of Arts. He supported many artists, including Hart Crane, George Gershwin and Arturo Toscanini. He was also smitten with Hollywood, to which Kuhn Loeb provided much commercial support and Kahn, personal support. In her second full-length film, &quot;Be Yourself&quot;, Fanny Brice sang a song that mentioned Kahn: &quot;Is something the matter with Otto Kahn, or is something wrong with me? I wrote a note and told him what a star I would make. He sent it back and marked it &#x27;Opened by mistake.&#x27;&quot;

He was parodied as Roscoe W. Chandler in the stage and film versions of the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;.

Kahn was chairman of the New York committee of the Shakespeare Tercentenary (1916). He was elected to honorary membership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity by the Fraternity&#x27;s Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory in 1917 and of the French Theatre of New York and a founder and later treasurer of the New Theatre Company.

Otto&#x27;s son, Roger Wolfe Kahn, was a popular jazz musician and bandleader of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Kahn&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, married John Barry Ryan II and was a New York society doyenne and benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera.

It is sometimes claimed that one of Otto Kahn&#x27;s most enduring achievements is his uncanny lookalike persona that purportedly became the iconic mascot for the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game. However, the family of the illustrator Daniel Fox, who in 1936 created the mascot Rich Uncle Pennybags for the Monopoly board game, in 2013, credited J. P. Morgan as being the inspiration for the character.

== Builder ==
As was typical for men of his stature of the era, Kahn maintained both a New York City residence and a home in the country. Kahn&#x27;s original country home, Cedar Grove, a gift from his father-in-law and designed by Carrère and Hastings was in Morristown, New Jersey. Although a resident there for a number of years and a business associate of many of his neighbors, antisemitism was still prevalent and Kahn was never accepted by Morristown society. Social rejection led him to move to Long Island and his New Jersey estate ultimately became home to Honeywell.

By 1919, Kahn had assembled a estate on Long Island, and had Oheka Castle (from &quot;Otto Hermann Kahn&quot;) built as its centerpiece. At , the 127-room structure was designed as the second-largest private residence in the United States (after George Vanderbilt&#x27;s Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina) by Delano &amp; Aldrich of New York City; its landscaping was designed by Olmsted Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted of Brookline, Massachusetts. The property featured a golf course, a working farm, a private airstrip, and numerous outbuildings.

Following Kahn&#x27;s death in 1934, the property was sold to the City of New York for use as a retreat for sanitation workers and then later a government training school for merchant marine radio operators. In the late 1940s, an upscale housing development was constructed there and in 1948, the Eastern Military Academy (EMA) purchased the mansion and around it. (One of the former EMA cadets has written his memories going to school there.) By the time the school went bankrupt thirty years later, the gardens had been bulldozed, its rooms subdivided and the paneled walls painted over. Following the departure of EMA, vandals repeatedly set fire to the building, but because Kahn had insisted on constructing a concrete, brick and steel structure, the house survived. In 1984 a local developer, Gary Melius, purchased the estate for $1.5 million and began the largest private renovation project ever attempted in the United States. Today, Oheka is used as a catering facility, hotel and conference center.

Following his acquisition in 1913 of the property at 1 East 91st Street in New York City from Andrew Carnegie, Kahn commissioned J. Armstrong Stenhouse and C. P. H. Gilbert to design his Carnegie Hill mansion. The home, an 80-room Italian Renaissance-palazzo style mansion, was modeled after the Cancelleria in Rome. Completed in 1918, it served as Kahn&#x27;s New York City residence until his death. Shortly thereafter, the house was sold to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, an independent Catholic girls school. In 1974 the house was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

In Palm Beach, Florida, Kahn built a summer home on Sunset Avenue, naming it &quot;Oheka&quot;. When this house proved too small, he built another &quot;Oheka&quot; at 691 North County Road. Following his death, this house was used by the Graham-Eckes School. In the 2000s, it was acquired by businessman Robert Cohen and returned to private use.

==Boat owner==
In 1927, Kahn commissioned German boat builder Lürssen to build a high-speed motor yacht for use on the river Rhine and in the North Sea. Designed using a classical round bottomed hull, she had a composite wooden plank over alloy metal frame structure. But innovative hull design meant that her hull flattened towards the rear third, and with her three 500 hp Maybach engines positioned forward in her hull, the resultant counterbalance and high power gave her a 34-knot top speed, the highest in her class for the day. &quot;Oheka II&quot; came to the notice of the German Navy, resulting in their development of the Schnellboot high speed torpedo craft within the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles.


==Personal life==
Kahn&#x27;s father was Bernhard Kahn, a son of Michael Kahn and Franziska Baer, a German-Jewish industrialist and banker who participated in the 1848 Revolt, and was condemned to death. He escaped to the United States, was naturalized an American citizen, and then returned to Germany ten years later to court and on October 17, 1860, married Emma Stephanie Eberstadt, whom he married on the condition that he not return to the United States. The couple had eight children and Otto was the third son.

He married Adelaide Wolff on January 8, 1896. They had four children: Maud; Margaret, whose daughter Virginia Ryan became Virginia Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie; Gilbert; and Roger Wolff Kahn.

Kahn was buried in the St. John&#x27;s Memorial Cemetery in Laurel Hollow, New York.

<doc id="419161" wikidata="Q1876030" url="?curid=419161" title="River Lugg">
<text>The River Lugg () rises near Llangynllo in Powys, Wales. From its source, it flows through the border town of Presteigne and then into Herefordshire, England. It meets its main tributary, the River Arrow, to the south of Leominster, then flows into the River Wye downstream of Hereford at Mordiford, around from its source. Its name comes from a Welsh root, and means &quot;bright stream&quot;.

As it passes through the countryside, it is crossed by a number of bridges, many of which are listed structures. Lugg Bridge at Lugwardine and the bridge at Mordiford with its associated causeway both date from the 14th century. The river at Leominster was altered significantly in the 1960s, when it was diverted to the south and then along the course of the Leominster and Kington Railway around the northern edge of the town, as part of a flood defence scheme. In the past, it was important for milling, supplying power to nearly one third of the mills in Herefordshire at the time of the Domesday Book. There are a few mills left, and some obvious mill sites, but many of the mills below Leominster were bought up and their weirs demolished as part of a scheme to make the river navigable in the 1690s. This was not a success, as the water levels dropped creating shoals, and in the 1720s, some of the weirs were reinstated, with pound locks to enable boats to bypass them. Navigation up to Leominster was for a time possible, although it was never hugely successful, and ceased in the 1860s, once railways had been built in the area.

The river was a free navigation as a result of powers obtained in an act of Parliament, the Rivers Wye and Lugg Navigation Act 1695 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 14), but in 2002, the Environment Agency became the navigation authority following the passing of the Wye Navigation Order 2002 (SI 2002/1998). This reaffirmed the right of navigation on the river, but prohibited the building of locks and weirs, and so most boating is by canoes and kayaks. The river is also used for fishing, as it has good populations of wild brown trout and grayling. Water quality of the river system is moderate, although some of its tributaries have poor water quality, and some bad. In common with many rivers, the chemical quality changed from good to fail in 2019, following the introduction of testing for chemicals not previously included in the quality assessment. The whole of the river is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and since 2003, a policy of building fish passes where there are weirs has led to significant improvements to the presence of migratory fish in the river.

==Course==
The River Lugg rises at two locations on Pool Hill, to the north-west of Llangunllo, close to the contour, and is joined by several other streams as it descends rapidly. It is crossed by the Heart of Wales Line, between and stations, before passing under the first of four bridges that carry the B4356 road over it. Already it has dropped below the contour. It turns to the east to reach Greenstreet Bridge on the B4356, and then to the south-east to pass the village of Llangunllo. Just beyond it is Llangunllo Bridge, again on the B4356. Mynachdy moated enclosure, a well-preserved medieval moated homestead is situated on the north bank, after which the river turns to the south to pass the grade I listed Monaughty House, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. It is one of the oldest stone buildings in Radnorshire, and renovation in the 1990s saw many of its later 19th century modifications removed.

Next it is crossed by the A488 Penybont to Shrewsbury road, after which a tributary joins on the south bank. Castell Foel-Allt, the remains of a medieval motte and bailey castle is located on the north bank, and is a scheduled monument. It passes under Whitton Bridge on the B4357 road, and is joined by Cascob Brook on its south bank. Almost opposite is a short section of Offa&#x27;s Dyke, a long linear earthworks which roughly defined much of the border between England and Wales. After a fourth crossing by the B4356, it arrives on the outskirts of Presteigne. It is crossed by the narrow, single-arched Old Boultibrooke Bridge, probably dating from the 18th century, which has been bypassed by a new bridge constructed in 1932, just to its east. After it is joined by Norton Brook and the English/Welsh border, the river continues along the northern edge of Presteigne, passing the Old Mill, formerly known as New Mill House. Close by is the weir which once powered the mill. Lugg Bridge, the first of several with this name, carries Ford Street over the river, and has three segmental arches. The basic structure dates from the 17th century, but it has been heavily modified.

Continuing eastwards, the river comes to Rosser&#x27;s Bridge, where the border turns to the south, and the river is wholly in Herefordshire. Hindwell Brook joins on the south bank, and the course turns to the north-east. Another tributary, Lime Brook, flows southwards to join the north bank. Just before Lyepole Bridge, the river passes a castle mound, which was once a motte castle, founded by Hugh Mortimer in the mid-12th century. As the river turns to the south-east, a large weir directs water into a mill leat, which runs on the north side of the main channel to Aymestrey Mill, a grist mill built in the 1860s. Most of the machinery is still in situ, and the wheel now powers a printing press. The A4110 road bridge crosses the river and the mill tailrace, and as the river turns to the south, a similar weir creates a leat to the west of the river. Mortimer&#x27;s Cross Water Mill is located further to the south, fed by another weir. It is long and a leat feeds the mill, which has three sets of stones. It was a paper mill until the 1830s, and then became a grain mill. New machinery was installed in 1870 and it produced animal feed until the 1940s. It is unusual in that it was designed to be operated by one man. It has been restored and on days when it is open to the public, it can be seen in operation.

To the south of the mill is Lugg Bridge, consisting of three arches, two spanning the river and a third spanning the mill tailrace. The north face dates from 1771, when the bridge was built, while the south face dates from 1938, when it was widened. At Lugg Green, Kingsland is another Lugg Bridge, and after a series of weirs, the river arrives on the northern edge of Leominster. A leat to Crowards Mill, now disconnected from the main river, was formerly the main channel of the Lugg, with much of the flow passing over a weir into the Kenwater. The Lugg served Osborne Mill, Marsh Mill and a third corn mill, before rejoining the Kenwater within the town. Pinsley Brook ran through the town just to the south of Kenwater, to power Pinsley Mill, another corn mill just to the north of Leominster railway station and joined the Lugg below Eaton Bridge. There were once 19 bridges in Leominster, most of them crossing the Lugg, Kenwater or Pinsley Brook. The river system within the town was radically reworked in the 1960s, as part of a flood alleviation scheme. The Lugg continued southwards along the course of the Kenwater, to a new weir close to the former course of the Leominster and Kington Railway. The Kenwater passed over the weir, while a new channel was cut for the Lugg, following the course of the railway. It then passed under the railway to meet the Ridgemoor Brook, and under Ridgemoor Bridge, a single span that dates from 1815 but was widened in 1940, which carries the A44 road. Below the bridge, it is joined by Cheaton Brook, and then rejoins its original course. The Pinsley Brook was diverted into the Kenwater to the west of the town in 1968 and its original course filled in. Parts of it had been culverted some years before that.

The Lugg then passes under Mosaic Bridge, constructed for the A49 bypass in 1988. It takes its name from a mosaic on the southern pier which was designed by young people at the time of its construction, and has since been restored. Eaton Bridge, carrying the A44, has three arches and was built in the 16th century, with modifications made in the 18th century. Near Eaton Hall is another three-arched bridge, dating from the 19th century, where the eastern arch crosses a leat. The river is then joined by the River Arrow on its western bank, and was crossed by the Worcester, Bromyard and Leominster Railway until it was closed in 1964. As the river passes under Ford Bridge at Ford, the B4361 road, the railway and the A49 road are squeezed into a narrow gap between it and War Hill to the west. The next bridge downstream is Hampton Court Bridge at Hope under Dinmore, a single span which carries the A417. It may have been designed by Sir Jeffry Wyattville for the Arkwright family who lived at Hampton Court, a grade I listed house built between 1427 and 1436 and modified in the 18th century. The river forms the western and southern boundaries of the associated parkland and the building was remodelled and restored by Wyattville for Richard Arkwright at that time. The Humber Brook forms the eastern boundary of the estate, and joins the Lugg on its north bank.
The river continues to the east and then turns to the south. At Bodenham is the single-span Bodenham Bridge, dating from 1816, after which the river turns to the west. It is crossed by two bridges carrying the Welsh Marches Line just to the south of the twin tunnels through Dinmore Hill. Dinmore railway station was located on the north bank, until it closed in 1958. The river crosses back under the railway a little further to the south. At Marden a hump-backed bridge with four spans crosses the river. It is grade II* listed and the Ordnance Survey call it Laystone Bridge, while English Heritage call it Leystone Bridge. Wellington Brook joins on the west bank of the river, opposite the grade I listed church of St Mary, Marden, which dates from the 13th and 14th centuries. As it approaches Moreton Bridge, the channel splits into two, enclosing an island, and the three-span bridge crosses both channels. It dates from the 16th or 17th century, but was altered in the mid-19th century. The bridge is to the east of the village of Moreton on Lugg. After Wergins Bridge, Morton Brook joins on the west bank, and the river is crossed by a railway bridge carrying the Cotswold Line.

Lugg Bridge at Lugwardine dates from the 14th century, and was repaired in 1409 and 1464. It has three arches, and was widened in the 1960s, when the south side was largely rebuilt. The Little Lugg joins from the east near the bridge, which was the location of corn mills in 1903, when a structure spanned the river to the south of the bridge. A little further downstream is Lugwardine Bridge, consisting of three spans dating from the early 17th century. It was widened in 1824 and altered in the 20th century. After the River Frome joins on the east bank, the final bridge connects Mordiford on the east bank to Hampton Bishop. The bridge dates from the 14th century, and was widened in the 16th century. It consists of two main arches, through which the Lugg flows, with two flood arches and a causeway containing five more arches to the west of the main arches. The causeway was widened on the upstream side in the 20th century. To the west of the causeway are the remains of a pound lock. The walls of the chamber survive, although they are in poor condition. The Pentaloe Brook joins the river on its east bank just below the bridge, and then the Lugg joins the River Wye.

== History ==
At the time of the Domesday Book, which recorded details of a survey of the land in 1086, the Lugg was an important river for milling. Some 80 mills were recorded in the county of Herefordshire, and of those, around one third were located in the valley of the Lugg, some on tributaries and others on the main river. In addition, those on the Lugg were valued considerably higher than those elsewhere, with an average value of 15 shillings and 4 pence, compared to 6 shillings and 7 pence for mills on other rivers. At that time, the hay meadows on the banks of the Lugg were the largest in the county, and the valley produced large crops of hay and corn. At least four of the sites were recorded as having fulling mills subsequently, but none were recorded when a survey of the river was made in 1697.

Between the 17th and 19th centuries, four acts of Parliament were passed which specifically named the River Lugg in their titles, but the middle two had the most effect on the river. The first, the Rivers Wye and Lugg Navigation Act 1726 (13 Geo. 1. c. 34) (14 Cha. 2. c. &quot;15&quot;), was passed on 19 May 1662, entitled &quot;An Act for the making navigable the Rivers Wye and Lugg, and the Rivers and Brooks running into the same, in the counties of Hereford, Gloucester and Monmouth.&quot; Sir William Sandys was appointed to carry out the work, which involved building weirs and flash locks to maintain water levels, but his previous experience on the Warwickshire Avon did not fit the Wye, which was a much steeper and faster-flowing river, and the work was abandoned by about 1668, before any work had been started on the Lugg.

The second act of Parliament was obtained on 17 March 1695, the Rivers Wye and Lugg Navigation Act 1695 (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 14), entitled &quot;An Act for making navigable the Rivers of Wye and Lugg, in the county of Hereford.&quot; One important effect of this act was that it re-established both rivers as free navigations, for it contained the clause:
Therefore be it enacted that the rivers Wye and Lugg may be henceforth accounted, deemed and taken to be free and common rivers for all to make use of for carrying and conveying of all passenger goods, wares and commodities by boats, barges, lighters and other vessels whatsoever.

On many of Britain&#x27;s lowland rivers, there was an uneasy relationship between use of the water for milling, which required weirs to be built, and navigation, which required freedom of movement along the waterway. The Rivers Wye and Lugg Navigation Act 1695 took a radical approach, allowing the weirs to be bought and demolished, with funding for the purchases to be raised by a rate on the county of Herefordshire. On the Wye, some of the weirs were associated with fishing, but on the Lugg, all of them were connected with milling. Details of them have survived, because a comprehensive survey was carried out by an anonymous author, thought to be Daniel Dennell, who had previously worked on the Exeter Canal, and Dennell&#x27;s document was acquired by the British Museum in 1856. The survey listed ten mills between Lugg Bridge, Leominster and the junction with the Wye, but this was probably the number of wheels or pairs of millstones, rather than the number of buildings where milling occurred. The annual value of each mill was to be established, and the price to buy the mill and weir was then fixed at 16 times that value.

It is not clear exactly what work was done, since the relevant sheets from the accounts are missing, but a lot of money was spent. Locks may have been put into some of the weirs; this was certainly true at Tidnor, and may have also been the case at the confluence with the Wye, at Mordiford, Hampton Court, and some other sites. Several bridges were altered, by breaking one of the arches and constructing a timber drawbridge or later a raised arch. Overall, the policy of removing the weirs was not a success, as it meant that water levels dropped significantly, and navigation was hindered by shoals, which prevented boats from passing. A third act of Parliament, the Rivers Wye and Lugg Navigation Act 1726 (13 Geo. 1. c. 34) was obtained on 15 May 1727, which openly stated that destroying the weirs had been a mistake, and allowed the trustees to reinstate them, with associated locks. Neither the minutes nor the accounts for this phase of the work have survived.

Thomas Chinn, a millwright from Tewkesbury, was employed to build locks around 1748, after money was raised by subscriptions in Leominster. He was later indicted for building locks against four bridges, but this charge may have been malicious. When the case was heard, he was only fined sixpence for each bridge and was not required to remove the locks. There are known to have been locks at twelve sites between Leominster and the Wye, at Volca Meadow, Ford Bridge, Hampton Court, Bodenham Mill, Kings Mill, Moreton Bridge, Wergins Bridge, Sherwick Mill, Lugg Bridge, Tidnor, Mordiford and the confluence. Some of these may have been half locks or flash locks, but some were definitely pound locks with two sets of gates, and of the three locks still in existence in 1906, both Tidnor and Mordiford were pound locks, but no clear evidence for a second set of gates at Lugg Bridge has been found. Barges on the river were hauled by teams of men. A fourth act of Parliament was obtained, the Wye and Lugg Navigation and Horse Towing-path Act 1809 (49 Geo. 3. c. lxxviii), to allow horse towing paths to be constructed on the Wye and the Lugg, but there is no evidence that such a path was ever started on the Lugg.

The arrival of railways in the area in the 1850s led to the winding up of the Wye and Lugg Towing Path Company, and use of both the Lugg and the Wye for navigation ceased soon afterwards. Some traffic may have used the lower of the Lugg up to Lugg Bridge until about 1860.

As a result of the Rivers Wye and Lugg Navigation Act 1695, the Lugg was a free navigation, but in 1995 the National Rivers Authority sought to apply bylaws to both the Wye and the Lugg. Their case was taken to the High Court, and was continued by the Environment Agency, which superseded the National Rivers Authority later that year. This action eventually led to the granting of the Wye Navigation Order 2002 (SI 2002/1998), which reaffirmed the right of navigation on both rivers, appointed the Environment Agency as the navigation authority for the rivers, but prohibited the construction of weirs and locks. Most use of the river is now by canoes and kayaks, although it is still sometimes used by small boats but can be very dangerous when in flood. In February 2020, it was one of several rivers with severe flood warnings following the impact of Storm Dennis.

== Recreation ==
The river is popular with canoeists who have undisputed rights of navigation. However travelling from Leominster to Hereford is challenged by numerous fallen trees obstructing the river. It is a good fishing river, with populations of wild brown trout and grayling.

==Environment==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail. Equivalent data for the Welsh section is not readily available.

The water quality of the River Lugg system was as follows in 2019.
Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

From its source to its mouth, the entire length of the river has been a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 2 February 1995. It received the designation because it was one of the best examples of a clay river, with its chemistry changing from nutrient-poor in the upper reaches to naturally nutrient-rich in the lower reaches. As well as supporting several rare plant communities and otters, it also provides habitat for Atlantic stream crayfish, Atlantic Salmon, Bullhead and Twaite Shad. Below Eaton, the river is a designated Special Area of Conservation (SAC). During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a sharp drop in the number of migrating salmon on the river, as access was impeded by weirs. From 2003, a number of fish passes were constructed at these locations, and a survey in 2013 found that numbers of salmon in the river and in the tributary River Arrow had increased dramatically. The survey also found that brown trout had benefitted from the improvements, as their numbers had also increased. Some of the work was funded by the Lugg and Arrow Fisheries Association.

The Eaton Angling Club, which was established in 1877, manages the fishing rights on of the river near Eaton Hall. Every year since 1955, they had stocked the river with 500 to 600 rainbow trout, but in 2009, some of their stocking was with triploid brown trout, infertile females which cannot inter-breed with the wild trout. Because of the conservation status of the river, and guided by the Environment Agency&#x27;s &quot;National Trout and Grayling Fisheries Strategy&quot;, they have reduced the levels of stocking, which still include some triploid brown trout. Research on similar rivers has shown that reducing the levels of restocking can have a disproportionate benefit for the native populations of both brown trout and grayling, and the club are monitoring catch data to see if this is the case on the Lugg. A survey by the Trout Trust identified the bridge at Eaton as a problem for migrating fish, as there is a weir which forms part of the bridge footings. While salmon and larger trout can easily negotiate the flume that this creates, it acts as a barrier to smaller fish, grayling and eels, and they recommended that some remedial action should be taken.

Construction of a Larinier fish pass at Ballsgate Weir, near Aymestrey, was expected to be completed in autumn 2019, but work was delayed by high water levels in the river throughout the winter from September onwards. The need for the fish pass was shown by fish surveys carried out above and below the weir, which showed that while plenty of salmon spawned below the weir, very few succeeded in getting further upstream. The fish pass was completed by the Wye and Usk Foundation in September 2020, and was funded by the European Regional Development Fund. The weir was the last major obstacle on the river for migrating salmon, and opens up miles of spawning grounds further upstream, in addition to making it easier for other species to move up and down the river.

== 2020 and 2021 illegal damage ==
In November/December 2020, damage was done to a stretch of the riverbank near Kingsland in Herefordshire. The damaged area, which was part of the SSSI, was home to protected wildlife including crayfish, otters, salmon, and lampreys. It was discovered that trees had been felled, river-bed gravel removed, the meanders straightened, and all vegetation in the area had been dug up by bulldozer, without permission, leaving the riverbank devastated.

A lawyer for Salmon and Trout Conservation, who is also a local resident, said:

The Environment Agency, Natural England and the Forestry Commission interrupted the work, preventing further damage. Herefordshire Wildlife Trust said the changes would have &quot;huge repercussions for wildlife downstream&quot; and urged that the landowner responsible be prosecuted. John Price, the landowner, has stated that he was acting legally, and had been asked to carry out the work to prevent flooding of nearby homes. Further damage was done in December 2021.

In March 2022, the Environment Agency and Natural England launched legal proceedings against the landowner, following an investigation. John Price, the landowner, was ordered to appear at Kidderminster Magistrates&#x27; Court in May 2022. He admitted seven charges relating to the dumping of materials, modifying the watercourse and natural features, using vehicles to disturb species of interest, and destroying flora and fauna, river habitats and fish populations.

In April 2023, Price was jailed for twelve months and ordered to pay a total of over £1.2million in court costs and for the restoration of the affected stretch of river. His sentence was reduced to 10 months on appeal, and he served 3 months before being released in July 2023.

<text>Norman David Mayer (March 31, 1916 – December 9, 1982) was an American anti-nuclear weapons activist who was shot and killed by the United States Park Police after threatening to blow up the Washington Monument.

==Early life==
Mayer was born in El Paso, Texas, to Jesse and Margott Mayer. After his father died two years later, his penniless mother moved him and his brother Aubrey to New Orleans; she then entered nursing school and placed the children in an orphanage. As a teenager, Mayer attended a trade school where he trained as a tool and die maker. He left New Orleans and spent much of the 1930s travelling from job to job from Nome, Alaska, to the Caribbean, working in a rubber plant and in gold mines among other jobs. He was drafted into the United States Navy in 1944 while living in Los Angeles and spent two years stationed at the San Diego Naval Station. He was discharged as a fireman first class and returned to a life of drifting, working in Miami as a machinist in the mid-1950s, as a hotel maintenance man in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Jamaica during the 1960s, and as a helicopter mechanic in South Vietnam from 1969 to 1970. In 1971, he was seriously injured while working on an oil rig in Brunei and recuperated in Singapore before traveling across South Asia. In 1976, he was arrested in Hong Kong for possession of of marijuana in a botched attempt to make a sale. Mayer researched the law in jail and after fifteen months managed to have his conviction reversed on a technicality. He was deported back to the U.S. and returned to working in hotels.

==Nuclear weapons protests and Washington Monument threat==

In 1978, Mayer focused on protesting nuclear weapons. He wished to stage a destructive and dramatic event to grab attention for his cause, and unsuccessfully tried to purchase explosives in Hazard, Kentucky, in May 1982. Mayer moved to Washington, DC in June that year, and spent every day for the next few months displaying large plywood signs in front of the White House and proselytizing to passing tourists. Mayer eventually found this manner of protesting frustrating and ineffectual and developed a new attention-getting scheme.

On December 8, 1982, Mayer drove a white van bearing the message &quot;#1 PRIORITY: BAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS&quot; in large letters on its side up to the base of the Washington Monument and jumped out wearing a black motorcycle helmet, a bright blue snowsuit and carrying a remote control. Mayer claimed that he would destroy the Monument with of TNT loaded in his van unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken. Mayer also claimed that he had a hidden accomplice who could also detonate the explosives.

The U.S. Park Police evacuated nearby buildings and closed down streets for several blocks. Eight tourists were initially trapped inside the Monument, but were released after AP reporter Steven Komarow began negotiating with Mayer. Ten hours into the negotiation, Mayer jumped into his van and started to drive off, threatening to become &quot;a moving time bomb in downtown Washington&quot;. The police opened fire, striking Mayer four times—twice in the head.

The Park Police later claimed that they did not intend to shoot Mayer, but were instead aiming for the van&#x27;s engine. Their subsequent investigation disclosed that Mayer had neither explosives nor an accomplice.

Mayer was one of a number of individuals connected to the White House Peace Vigil at Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. &quot;The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue&quot; (2012) by Tim Wilkerson, a documentary commissioned by the Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, recounts the lives of Mayer, Thomas, Concepcion Picciotto and Ellen Thomas. Thomas, who believed in nonviolence, refused to take part in Mayer&#x27;s plan to destroy public monuments, as Mayer was unable to assure her of the safety of civilians and officials.

==Reactions==
George Stephanopoulos, later White House Press Secretary and communications director under President Bill Clinton, was a 21-year-old intern at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace when Mayer stopped in his office several times to discuss nuclear disarmament. On December 8, 1982, Stephanopoulos made his first appearance on &quot;Nightline&quot; to discuss Mayer.

In the December 19, 1982, installment of his column &quot;An Edge in My Voice&quot;, the writer and activist Harlan Ellison discussed the incident, expressing great sympathy for Mayer&#x27;s position and outrage at what he regarded as an overreaction by law enforcement. Ellison, who claimed to have recognized Mayer&#x27;s threat as a bluff as soon as he heard TV reports on the crisis, noted that, had the threat been genuine, the explosion of of TNT, even at such close proximity, would have barely damaged the Washington Monument&#x27;s exterior and could not have possibly destroyed it. Ellison expressed his sadness over the unnecessary death of Mayer saying, &quot;Had there been a scintilla of compassion, rather than macho posturing, in any of the authorities handling the situation, it need not have ended as it did. But there were none... not on the part of the White House advisors who moved Ronald Reagan&#x27;s luncheon out of the room facing the Monument. And not on the part of our noble President who, like Richard Nixon, saw what was going on and shrugged, and ignored his responsibility.&quot; The column was among several reprinted in Ellison&#x27;s collections &quot;An Edge in My Voice&quot; and &quot;Edgeworks 1&quot;. A recording of Ellison reading the column is found on the CD &quot;On the Road with Ellison Volume 1&quot;.

<text>George Ralph Noory (born June 4, 1950) is an American radio talk show host. Since January 2003, Noory has been the weekday host of the late-night radio talk show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. The program is syndicated to hundreds of radio stations in the U.S. and Canada by Premiere Networks. Noory has also appeared in the History Channel series &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; and in &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, a subscription-based online video series presented by Gaia.

==Life and career==
Noory grew up in Detroit with two younger sisters, the son of a Lebanese Egyptian father who worked at Ford Motor Company and a Lebanese American mother. He was raised Roman Catholic. He became interested in the paranormal and ufology as a child and joined the UFO organization NICAP as a teenager. Noory served nine years in the United States Naval Reserve as a lieutenant.

Noory began his radio career as a newscaster with Detroit station WCAR-AM. From 1974–1978 he worked as a news producer and executive news producer at WJBK-TV in Detroit. He would later serve as news director for KMSP-TV in Minneapolis and as news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis. He won three local Emmy Awards for his work in TV news.

In St. Louis, Noory formed Norcom Entertainment, Inc., a company that developed and marketed video training films to law enforcement and security agencies. In 1987, Noory and his partners in Norcom Restaurants, Inc. opened the &quot;Café Marrakesh and Oasis Bar&quot; in Brentwood, Missouri. The restaurant&#x27;s theme revolved around a fictional English soldier, Col. William Berry, who opened the establishment following an exciting secret mission to Marrakesh.

In 1996, Noory hosted a late-night radio program called &quot;Nighthawk&quot; on KTRS in St. Louis, which caught the attention of executives at Premiere Radio Networks, syndicators of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; is an American late-night radio talk show that deals with a variety of topics, but most frequently ones that relate to either the paranormal or conspiracy theories. In April 2001, Noory became a guest host for &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; before replacing Ian Punnett as the Sunday night host. In January 2003, following Art Bell&#x27;s retirement, Noory took over as weeknight host of &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;.

In December 2012, Gaiam TV launched &quot;Beyond Belief with George Noory&quot;, a subscription-based webcast exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

==Reception==
In a 2010 article about Noory published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Timothy Lavin wrote: &quot;Noory can be an uneven broadcaster. Sometimes he seems to not pay full attention to his guests, offers strangely obvious commentary, or—and this has alienated some fans—lets clearly delusional or pseudoscientific assertions slide by without challenge. But he listens, with heroic patience, to all of his callers.&quot;

According to &quot;Media Life Magazine&quot;, &quot;Noory says it doesn&#x27;t matter whether he believes what his callers and guests say. Ultimately, it&#x27;s about entertainment, creating a show that people will be drawn to.&quot; Author and frequent &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; guest Whitley Strieber has commented on Noory&#x27;s style, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not that he&#x27;s credulous or easily led. He&#x27;s willing to take these intellectual journeys. He&#x27;ll have guests on that you think are completely off the wall — nothing they&#x27;re saying is real — but by the end of the program you will have made a discovery that there is a kernel of a question worth exploring.&quot;

In March 2020, Noory voiced his opinions on the coronavirus pandemic stating: &quot;the media is creating hysteria by blowing the figures out of proportion. The media&#x27;s not putting that into perspective&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said that George Noory was much more likely to let things go unchallenged than Art Bell: &quot;Art was a little more, if he thought you were loo-la, he would tell you&quot;.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article titled &#x27;How Local Media Spreads Misinformation From Vaccine Skeptics&#x27;, Noory&#x27;s show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; has been part of that effect by Noory in unchallenged interviews with a large number of questionable anti-vaccine guests, who use the platform to reinforce unproven claims against the COVID-19 vaccines.

<doc id="419167" wikidata="Q1186260" url="?curid=419167" title="Creek War">
<text>The Creek War (also the Red Stick War or the Creek Civil War) was a regional conflict between opposing Native American factions, European powers, and the United States during the early 19th century. The Creek War began as a conflict within the tribes of the Muscogee, but the United States quickly became involved. British traders and Spanish colonial officials in Florida supplied the Red Sticks with weapons and equipment due to their shared interest in preventing the expansion of the United States into regions under their control.

The Creek War took place largely in modern-day Alabama and along the Gulf Coast. Major engagements of the war involved the United States military and the Red Sticks (or Upper Creeks), a Muscogee tribal faction who resisted U.S. territorial expansion. The United States formed an alliance with the traditional enemies of the Muscogee, the Choctaw and Cherokee nations, as well as the Lower Creeks faction of the Muscogee. During the hostilities, the Red Sticks allied themselves to the British. A Red Stick force aided British Naval Officer Alexander Cochrane&#x27;s advance towards New Orleans. The Creek War effectively ended in August 1814 with the signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson, when Andrew Jackson forced the Creek confederacy to surrender more than 21 million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama.

According to historian John K. Mahon, the Creek War &quot;was as much a civil war among Creeks as between red and white&quot;. The war was also a continuation of Tecumseh&#x27;s War in the Old Northwest, and, although a conflict framed within the centuries-long American Indian Wars, it is usually more identified with, and considered an integral part of, the War of 1812.

==Background==
Creek militancy was a response to increasing United States cultural and territorial encroachment into their traditional lands. However, the war&#x27;s alternate designation as the &quot;Creek Civil War&quot; comes from the divisions within the tribe over cultural, political, economic, and geographic matters. At the time of the Creek War, the Upper Creeks controlled the Coosa, Tallapoosa, and Alabama Rivers that lead to Mobile; while the Lower Creeks controlled the Chattahoochee River, which flows into Apalachicola Bay. The Lower Creek were trading partners with the United States and, unlike the Upper Creeks, had adopted more of their cultural practices.

===Territorial conflict===
The provinces of East and West Florida, governed by Spanish and British firms like Panton, Leslie, and Co., provided most of the European trading goods into Creek country. Pensacola and Mobile, in Spanish Florida, controlled the outlets of the U.S. Mississippi Territory&#x27;s rivers.

Territorial conflicts between France, Spain, Britain, and the United States along the Gulf Coast that had previously helped the Creeks to maintain control over most of the United States&#x27; southwestern territory had shifted dramatically due to the Napoleonic Wars, the West Florida Rebellion, and the War of 1812. This made long-standing intra-Creek trade and political alliances more tenuous than ever.

In the Treaty of New York (1790), Treaty of Colerain (1796), Treaty of Fort Wilkinson (1802), and Treaty of Washington (1805), the Creek ceded parts of their Georgia territory east of the Ocmulgee River. In 1804, the United States claimed the city of Mobile under the Mobile Act. The 1805 treaty with the Creek also allowed the creation of the Federal Road that linked Washington, D.C. to the newly acquired port city of New Orleans, which partially stretched through Creek territories.

During and after the American Revolution, the United States wished to maintain the Indian Line which had been established by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The Indian Line created a boundary for colonial settlement in order to prevent illegal encroachment into Indian lands, and also helped the U.S. government maintain control over Indian trade. Still, traders and settlers often violated the terms of the treaties establishing the Indian Line, and frontier settlement by colonists in Indian lands was one of the arguments the United States used to expand its territory.

These increasing territorial grabs westward into Creek territory (which included parts of Spanish Florida), coupled with the Louisiana Purchase (which neither the British nor the Spaniards recognized at the time), compelled the British and Spanish governments to strengthen existing alliances with the Creek. In 1810, following the occupation of Baton Rouge during the West Florida Rebellion, the United States sent an expeditionary force to occupy Mobile. As a result, Mobile was jointly occupied by weak detachments of American and Spanish soldiers until Secretary of War John Armstrong ordered General James Wilkinson to force the Spaniards to turn over control of the city in February 1813.

The Patriot Army captured parts of East Florida from 1811–1815. After Fort Charlotte was surrendered in April, the Spaniards focused on protecting Pensacola from the United States. The Spaniards decided to support the Creeks in an attack on the United States and in defense of their homeland, but were greatly hindered by their weak position in the Floridas and lack of supplies even for their own army.

===Cultural assimilation and religious revival===
The splintering of the Creek peoples along progressive and nativist lines had roots dating back to the eighteenth century, but came to a head after 1811. Red Stick militancy was a response to the economic and cultural crises in Creek society caused by the adoption of Western trade goods and culture. From the 16th century, the Creeks had formed successful trade alliances with European empires, but the drastic fall in the price of deerskin from 1783 to 1793 made it more difficult for individuals to repay their debt, while at the same time the assimilation process made American goods more necessary. The Red Sticks particularly resisted the &quot;civilization&quot; programs administered by the U.S. Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins, who had stronger alliances among the towns of the Lower Creek. Some of the &quot;progressive&quot; Creek began to adopt American farming practices as their game disappeared, and as more Anglo settlers assimilated into Creek towns and families.

Leaders of the Lower Creek towns in present-day Georgia included Bird Tail King (&quot;Fushatchie Mico&quot;) of Cusseta, Little Prince (&quot;Tustunnuggee Hopoi&quot;) of Broken Arrow, and William McIntosh (&quot;Tunstunuggee Hutkee&quot;, White Warrior) of Coweta. Many of the most prominent Creek chiefs before the Creek War were &quot;mixed-bloods&quot;, like William McGillivray and William McIntosh (who were on opposing sides of the Creek Civil War).

Before the Creek War and the War of 1812, most U.S. politicians saw removal to be the only alternative to the assimilation of native peoples into Western culture. The Creeks, on the other hand, blended their own culture with adopted trade goods and political terms, and had no intention of abandoning their land.

The Americanization of the Creeks was more prevalent in western Georgia among the Lower Creeks than in Upper Creek towns, and came from internal and external processes. The U.S. government&#x27;s and Benjamin Hawkins&#x27; pressure on the Creeks to assimilate stood in contrast to the more natural blending of cultures that came from a long tradition of cohabitation and cultural appropriation, beginning with white traders in Indian country.

The Shawnee leader Tecumseh came to the area to encourage the peoples to join his movement to throw the Americans out of Native American territories. Previously, he had united tribes in the Northwest (Ohio and related territories) to fight against U.S. settlers after the War for Independence. In 1811, Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa attended the annual Creek council at Tukabatchee. Tecumseh delivered an hour-long speech to an audience of 5,000 Creeks as well as an American delegation including Hawkins. Although the Americans dismissed Tecumseh as non-threatening, his message of resistance to Anglo encroachment was well received among Creek and Seminole, especially among more conservative and traditional elders and young men.

Mobilization of recruits to Tecumseh&#x27;s cause was bolstered by the Great Comet of 1811 and the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811–12, which were taken as evidence of Tecumseh&#x27;s supernatural powers. The war party rallied around prophets who had traveled with Tecumseh and remained with the Creek, influencing newly converted Creek religious leaders. Peter McQueen of &quot;Talisi&quot; (now Tallassee, Alabama); Josiah Francis (Hillis Hadjo) (Francis the Prophet) of &quot;Autauga&quot;, a Koasati town; and High-head Jim (&quot;Cusseta Tustunnuggee&quot;) and Paddy Walsh, both Alabamas, were among the spiritual leaders responding to rising concerns and the prophetic message. The militant faction of Creek stood in opposition of the Creek Confederacy Council&#x27;s official policies, particularly in regard to foreign relations with the United States. The rising war party began to be called &quot;Red Sticks&quot; at this timein Creek culture, red &#x27;sticks&#x27; or clubs symbolize war, while white sticks represent peace.

==Course of the war==
Creeks who did not support the war became targets for the prophets and their followers, and began to be murdered in their sleep or burned alive. Warriors of the prophets&#x27; parties also began to attack the property of their enemies, burning plantations and destroying livestock. The first major offensive of the civil war was the Red Stick attack on the Upper Creek town, and seat of the council, at Tuckabatchee on July 22, 1813.

In Georgia, a war party of &quot;friendly&quot; Creeks organized under William McIntosh, Big Warrior, and Little Prince attacked 150 Uchee warriors who were traveling to meet up with Red Stick Creeks in the Mississippi Territory. After this offensive in the beginning of October 1813, the party burned a number of Red Stick towns before retiring to Coweta.

Although there were a few limited attacks on whites in 1812 and early 1813, Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins did not believe that the disruption in the Creek Nation or the increasing war dances were a cause for concern. But in February 1813, a small war party of Red Sticks, led by Little Warrior, were returning from Detroit when they killed two families of settlers along the Ohio River. Hawkins demanded that the Creek turn over Little Warrior and his six companions, the standard operating procedure between the nations up to that point.

The first clashes between the Red Sticks and United States forces occurred on July 27, 1813. A group of territorial militia intercepted a party of Red Sticks returning from Spanish Florida, where they had acquired gunpowder, blankets and food from the Spanish governor at Pensacola. The Red Sticks escaped and the soldiers looted what they found. Seeing the Americans looting, the Creek regrouped and attacked and defeated the Americans. The Battle of Burnt Corn, as the exchange became known, broadened the Creek Civil War to include American forces.

Chiefs Peter McQueen and William Weatherford led an attack on Fort Mims, north of Mobile, on August 30, 1813. The Red Sticks&#x27; goal was to strike at mixed-blood Creek of the Tensaw settlement who had taken refuge at the fort. The warriors attacked the fort and killed a total of 400 to 500 people, including women and children and numerous white settlers. The attack became known as the Fort Mims massacre and became a rallying cause for American militia.

The Red Sticks subsequently attacked other forts in the area, including Fort Sinquefield. Panic spread among settlers throughout the Southwestern frontier, and they demanded U.S. government intervention. Federal forces were busy fighting the British and Northern Woodland tribes, led by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh in the Northwest. Affected states called up militias to deal with the threat.

After the Battle of Burnt Corn, U.S. Secretary of War John Armstrong notified General Thomas Pinckney, Commander of the 6th Military District, that the U.S. was prepared to take action against the Creek Confederacy. Furthermore, if Spain were found to be supporting the Creeks, an assault on Pensacola would ensue.

Brigadier General Ferdinand Claiborne, a militia commander in the Mississippi Territory, was concerned about the weakness of his sector on the western border of the Creek territory, and advocated preemptive strikes. But Major General Thomas Flourney, commander of 7th Military District, refused his requests. He intended to carry out a defensive American strategy. Meanwhile, settlers in that region sought refuge in blockhouses.

The Tennessee legislature authorized Governor Willie Blount to raise 5,000 militia for a three-month tour of duty. Blount called out a force of 2,500 West Tennessee men under Colonel Andrew Jackson to &quot;repel an approaching invasion ... and to afford aid and relief to ... Mississippi Territory&quot;. He also summoned a force of 2,500 from East Tennessee under Major General John Alexander Cocke. Jackson and Cocke were not ready to move until early October.

In addition to the state actions, U.S. Indian agent Hawkins organized the friendly Lower Creek under Major William McIntosh, an Indian chief, to aid the Georgia and Tennessee militias in actions against the Red Sticks. At the request of Chief Federal Agent Return J. Meigs (called &quot;White Eagle&quot; by the Indians for the color of his hair), the Cherokee Nation voted to join the Americans in their fight against the Red Sticks. Under the command of Chief Major Ridge, 200 Cherokee fought with the Tennessee Militia under Colonel Andrew Jackson.

At most, the Red Stick force consisted of 4,000 warriors, possessing perhaps 1,000 muskets. They had never been involved in a large-scale war, not even against neighboring American Indians. Early in the war, General Cocke observed that arrows &quot;form a very principal part of the enemy&#x27;s arms for warfare, every man having a bow with a bundle of arrows, which is used after the first fire with the gun until a leisure time for loading offers&quot;. Many Creek tried to remain friendly to the United States, but, after Fort Mims, few European Americans in the region distinguished between friendly and unfriendly Creeks.

The Holy Ground (Econochaca), located near the junction of the Alabama and Coosa Rivers, was the heart of the Red Stick Confederation. It was about 150 miles (240 km) from the nearest supply point available to any of the three American armies. The easiest attack route was from Georgia through the line of forts on the frontier and then along a good road that led to the Upper Creek towns near the Holy Ground, including nearby Hickory Ground. Another route was north from Mobile along the Alabama River. Jackson&#x27;s route of advance was south from Tennessee through a mountainous and pathless terrain.

===Georgia campaign===
By August, the Georgia Volunteer Army and state militia had been mobilized in anticipation of war with the Creeks. The news of Fort Mims first reached Georgia on September 16, and was taken as legal grounds to begin a military offensive. In addition, Benjamin Hawkins wrote to Brigadier General John Floyd on September 30 that the Red Stick war party had &quot;received 25 small guns&quot; at Pensacola. The immediate concern of the force was the defense of Georgia&#x27;s &quot;Indian Line&quot;, separating Indian territory from U.S. territory at the Ocmulgee River.

The proximity of Jasper and Jones counties to hostile Creek towns resulted in a regiment of Georgia volunteer militia under Major General David Adams. John Floyd was made general of the main Georgia army (in September 1812 and numbering 2,362 men). The Georgia Army was aided by Cherokee and independent Creek allies, as well as a number of Georgia volunteer militia. Floyd&#x27;s task was to advance to the junction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers and join the Army of Tennessee.

Due to the state&#x27;s failure to secure supplies early enough in the year, Floyd gained a few months to train and drill the men at Fort Hawkins. On November 24, General Floyd crossed the Chattahoochee and established Fort Mitchell, where he was joined by 300-400 Creek from Coweta, organized under McIntosh. With these allies and 950 of his men, Floyd began his advance towards the juncture of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers where he was supposed to rendezvous with Jackson. His first target was the major town of Autossee on the Tallapoosa River, a Red Stick stronghold only 20 miles from the Coosa River. On November 29, he attacked Autossee. Floyd&#x27;s losses were 11 killed and 54 wounded. Floyd estimated that 200 Creek were killed. Having achieved the destruction of the town, Floyd returned to Fort Mitchell.

The second westward advance of Floyd&#x27;s troops departed Fort Mitchell with a force of 1,100 militia and 400 friendly Creek. Along the way they fortified Fort Bainbridge and Fort Hull on the Federal Road. On January 26, 1813, they set up a camp on the Callabee Creek near the abandoned site of Autossee. Red Stick chiefs William Weatherford, Paddy Walsh, High-head Jim, and William McGillivray raised a combined force of at least 1,300 warriors to stop the advance. This was the largest combined force raised by the Creek during the entire war. On January 29, the Red Sticks launched an attack on the American camp at dawn. After daylight, Floyd&#x27;s army repulsed the attack. Casualty figures vary for Floyd&#x27;s force, from 17 to 22 killed, and 132 to 147 wounded. Floyd estimated Red Stick casualties as 37 killed, including Chief High-head Jim. Georgia retreated to Fort Mitchell with Floyd, who was severely wounded in the leg. The Battle of Calebee Creek was Georgia&#x27;s last offensive operation of the war.

===Mississippi militia===
In October, General Thomas Flournoy organized a force of about 1,000—consisting of the Third United States Infantry, militia, volunteers, and Choctaw Indians—at Fort Stoddert. General Claiborne, ordered to lay waste to Creek property near the junction of the Alabama and Tombigbee Rivers, advanced from Fort St. Stephen. He achieved some destruction but no military engagement. At roughly the same time, Captain Samuel Dale left Fort Madison (near Suggsville) going southward to the Alabama River. On November 12 a small party rowed out to intercept a war canoe. Dale wound up alone in the canoe in hand-to-hand combat with four warriors, an encounter which became known as the Canoe Fight.

Continuing to a point about 85 miles (140 km) north of Fort Stoddert, Claiborne established Fort Claiborne. On December 23, he encountered a small force at the Holy Ground and burned 260 houses. William Weatherford was nearly captured during this engagement. Casualties for the Mississippians were one killed and six wounded. Thirty Creek soldiers were killed in the engagement, however. Because of supply shortages, Claiborne withdrew to Fort St. Stephens.

===North Carolina and South Carolina militia===
Brigadier General Joseph Graham&#x27;s brigade of troops from North and South Carolina, including Colonel Reuben Nash&#x27;s South Carolina militia, deployed along the Georgia frontier to deal with the Red Sticks. Colonel Nash&#x27;s South Carolina regiment of volunteer militia traveled from South Carolina at the end of January 1814. The militia marched to the start of the Federal Road in Augusta, Georgia, walking to Fort Benjamin Hawkins (in modern Macon, Georgia) en route to reinforce the various forts including Fort Mitchell (in modern Phenix City, Alabama), Fort Bainbridge, Fort Hull, and Fort Decatur. Other companies in the Nash&#x27;s regiment were at Fort Mitchell by July 1814. Graham&#x27;s brigade participated in only a few skirmishes before returning home.

===Tennessee campaign===
Although Jackson&#x27;s mission was to defeat the Creek, his larger objective was to move on Pensacola. Jackson&#x27;s plan was to move south, build roads, destroy Upper Creek towns, and then later proceed to Mobile to stage an attack on Spanish-held Pensacola. He had two problems: logistics and short enlistments. When Jackson began his advance, the Tennessee River was low, making it difficult to move supplies, and there was little forage for his horses.

On October 10, Jackson, along with 2,500 troops, set out on the expedition, his arm in a sling. Jackson established Fort Strother as a supply base. On November 3, his top cavalry officer, Brigadier General John Coffee, defeated a band of Red Sticks at the Battle of Tallushatchee. It was a brutal battle, and many Red Sticks, including some women and children, were killed. After this, Jackson received a call for help from 150 allied Creeks besieged by 700 Red Stick warriors. Jackson marched his troops to relieve the siege, and won another decisive victory at the Battle of Talladega on November 9.

After Talladega, however, Jackson was plagued by supply shortages and discipline problems arising from his men&#x27;s short term enlistments. John Alexander Cocke, with the East Tennessee Militia, took the field on October 12. His route of march was from Knoxville to Chattanooga and then along the Coosa River toward Fort Strother. Because of rivalry between the East and West Tennessee militias, Cocke was in no hurry to join Jackson, particularly after he angered Jackson by mistakenly attacking a friendly village on November 17. When he finally reached Fort Strother on December 12, the East Tennessee men only had 10 days remaining on their enlistments. Jackson had no choice but to dismiss them. Furthermore, Brigadier General Coffee, who had returned to Tennessee for remounts, wrote Jackson that the cavalry had deserted. By the end of 1813, Jackson was down to a single regiment whose enlistments were due to expire in mid-January.

Although Governor William Blount had ordered a new levee of 2,500 troops, Jackson would not be up to full strength until the end of February. When a draft of 900 raw recruits arrived unexpectedly on January 14, Jackson was down to a cadre of 103 and Coffee, who had been &quot;abandoned by his men&quot;.

Since new men had enlistment contracts of only sixty days, Jackson decided to get the most out of his untried force. He departed Fort Strother on January 17 and marched toward the village of Emuckfaw to cooperate with the Georgia Militia. However, this was a risky decision. It was a long march through difficult terrain against a numerically superior force, the men were inexperienced, undisciplined, and insubordinate, and a defeat would have prolonged the war. After two indecisive battles at Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek, Jackson returned to Fort Strother and did not resume the offensive until mid-March.

The arrival of the 39th United States Infantry on February 6, 1814, provided Jackson a disciplined core for his force, which ultimately grew to about 5,000 men. After Governor Blount ordered the second draft of Tennessee militia, Cocke, with a force of 2,000 six-month men, once again marched from Knoxville to Fort Strother. Cocke&#x27;s men mutinied when they learned that Jackson&#x27;s men only had three-month enlistments. Cocke tried to pacify his men, but Jackson misunderstood the situation and ordered Cocke&#x27;s arrest as an instigator. The East Tennessee militia reported to Fort Strother without further comment on their term of service. Cocke was later cleared.

Jackson spent the next month building roads and training his force. In mid-March, he moved against the Red Stick force concentrated on the Tallapoosa at Tohopeka (Horseshoe Bend). He first moved south along the Coosa, about half the distance to the Creek position, and established a new outpost at Fort Williams. Leaving another garrison there, he then moved on Tohopeka with a force of about 3,000 effective fighting men augmented by 600 Cherokee and Lower Creek allies. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend, which occurred on March 27, was a decisive victory for Jackson, effectively ending the Red Stick resistance.

==Results==
On August 9, 1814, Andrew Jackson forced headmen of both the Upper and Lower towns of Creek to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson. Despite protest of the Creek chiefs who had fought alongside Jackson, the Creek Nation ceded 21,086,793 acres (85,335 km²) of land—approximately half of present-day Alabama and part of southern Georgia—to the United States government. Even though the Creek War was largely a civil war among the Creek, Andrew Jackson recognized no difference between his Lower Creek allies and the Red Sticks who fought against him. He took the lands of both for what he considered the security needs of the United States. Jackson forced the Creek to cede 1.9 million acres (7,700 km²) that was also claimed as hunting grounds of the Cherokee Nation, who had fought as U.S. allies during the Creek War as well.

With the Red Sticks subdued, Jackson turned his focus on the Gulf Coast region in the War of 1812. On his own initiative, he invaded Spanish Florida and drove a British force out of Pensacola. Pensacola had been a supply point for Red Sticks (see Battle of Burnt Corn Creek) and the Corps of Colonial Marines at Prospect Bluff. He defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.

On-going issues during 1816-1817 between residents along the border of the United States and Spanish Florida resulted in several incidents such as the battles of the Negro Fort, and Fowltown as well as the Scott massacare. In 1818, Jackson again invaded Spanish Florida, where some of the Red Stick leaders had fled, in an expedition known as the First Seminole War.

As a result of these victories, Jackson became a national figure and eventually was elected the seventh President of the United States in 1829. As president, Andrew Jackson advocated the Indian Removal Act, passed by Congress in 1830, which authorized negotiation of treaties for exchange of land and payment of annuities, and authorized forceful removal of the Southeastern tribes to prescribed Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, an ethnic cleansing now known as the Trail of Tears.

<doc id="419184" wikidata="Q1867169" url="?curid=419184" title="Local Mail Transfer Protocol">
<text>The Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP) is an alternative to (Extended) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for situations where the receiving side does not have a mail queue, such as a message transfer agent acting as a message delivery agent. LMTP was described in in 1996.

==Overview==
Mail queues are an inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since a mail storage server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more storage for a mail queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for a mail message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients.

LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each recipient, allowing the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be an Internet-facing mail gateway. LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks. In other words, the message transfer agent (MTA) still handles all outgoing mail, including the mail stream from the LMTP, to another mail server located somewhere on the Internet.

LMTP is an Application Layer protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite. It can use a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transport like SMTP, but must not use port number 25, the well-known port for SMTP. Usage of port 24 (&quot;any private mail system&quot;) is common among some mail server applications however.

==Differences from SMTP==
LMTP conversation syntax is based on the same commands as SMTP (formerly called Extended SMTP) with the following exceptions:
* LMTP must not be used on port 25, reserved for SMTP
*LMTP uses codice_1 verb instead of codice_2 or codice_3 used in SMTP
* ESMTP requires a single status for the entire message body. LMTP requires a response for each previously successful RCPT command. That is, in case of multiple recipients, after the body of the message has been transmitted, LMTP can still fail for some recipient while succeeding for the others. With this facility, LMTP can fail if a user is over quota without the burden of generating bounce messages.

The key difference is that LMTP will reject a message for a specific final recipient if it is not immediately deliverable. This removes the need for a mail queue. For this reason, LMTP is not run on the standard TCP port of SMTP.

<text>DRDC Valcartier is a major Canadian military research station at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier, Quebec, one of nine centres making up Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC).

Originally formed at the end of World War II in 1945 as the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment (CARDE), the intent was to keep the research teams built up during the war in Canada, as opposed to moving to the United States.

Starting in 1951 CARDE implemented a major missile development program, eventually delivering two combat systems, the Velvet Glove air-to-air missile and the Heller anti-tank rocket. Neither was accepted for production, but the basic research was used with local defence contractors to build up familiarity with the new technologies.

Starting in 1955 a serious effort to equip Canada with a useful anti–ballistic missile system was undertaken, along with research into the problems of detection and tracking, hypersonic flight, and fuels suitable for use in an interceptor missile. As part of this project a lengthy study of the upper atmosphere was undertaken from instrumented balloons. Another development from this era was the use of gun-fired models for high-speed testing, instead of using a wind tunnel. Led by Gerald Bull, the sabot–based system would go on to be used in Project HARP during the early 1960s. The early portions of the 1960s was taken up developing a series of increasingly powerful high-acceleration solid rocket propellants, and to test them they designed and built a test vehicle that would later become the Black Brant sounding rocket. Due to this research CARDE was later involved in the design of a US-Canada-Mexico meteorological sounding rocket, the Metroc. The ABM research eventually wound down with no working system in place, however the solid fuels developed during the program were widely used for rocketry in various western military systems.

CARDE then looked into using the new propellant as the basis for a new motor for existing 2.75-inch air-to-ground rockets. The result was the CRV-7 rocket, which had roughly twice the speed of the existing US design, and with enough energy to be able to puncture Warsaw Pact aircraft hangars. Production started at Bristol Aerospace in 1974, and the CRV-7 has been used by the Canadian and other air forces since that time.

In 1969 a re-alignment from pure research to smaller projects directly requested by the Armed Forces took place, along with a change of name to Defence Research Establishment Valcartier (DREV) and a general downsizing of the station and its budgets. Since then DREV has undertaken numerous projects in the field of battlefield command and control, detection and monitoring, and various battlefield decoy systems.

On April 1, 2000, DREV was renamed &quot;Defence R&amp;D Canada – Valcartier&quot; when the overseeing organisation became the Defence Research and Development Canada agency.

<text>Holger Klaus Meins (26 October 1941 – 9 November 1974) was a German cinematography student who joined the Red Army Faction (RAF) in the early 1970s and died on hunger strike in prison.

==As a revolutionary==
Meins became an important member of the RAF and was seen as a leading figure. He was very involved in the group&#x27;s clandestine work, for instance hiring a metal sculptor to design a grenade casing and bomb mould designed which could be placed under a woman&#x27;s dress, giving the impression that she was pregnant, telling the sculptor that it was a prop for a film project.

On 1 June 1972, Meins and Andreas Baader, along with Jan-Carl Raspe, went to check on a storage garage in Frankfurt where they were storing explosives. The police had been surveilling the garage after a tip from a local resident. Meins and Baader entered the garage and were immediately surrounded. The police blocked the exit of the garage and fired tear gas grenades into the garage via a back window. Baader threw the tear gas back out. The stand-off did not last long after Baader was severely wounded when shot in the hip; Meins surrendered soon after. All three men were arrested.

In prison, Meins and the other RAF prisoners launched several hunger strikes to protest the conditions of their imprisonment. 

As the hunger strike entered its seventh week, 32 activists from &quot;anti-torture committees&quot; from across the country occupied the Amnesty International headquarters in Hamburg to protest against prison conditions. The police cleared the office but did not take any personal details. Much later it became clear that around half of the activists later joined the RAF. Including Wolfgang Grams, who was later shot by GSG 9.

Meins died by starvation on hunger strike, on 9 November 1974. Although Meins was 1.83 meters (6&#x27;0&quot;) tall, he weighed only 39 kg (86 lbs) at the time of his death.

==Aftermath==

Meins&#x27;s death sparked many protest actions across Europe, with many turning violent. RAF members grew more opposed to the German state. 

Hans-Joachim Klein, who acted as chauffeur for Jean-Paul Sartre in a meeting with Andreas Baader and became a militant, claimed that Meins&#x27;s death showed him &quot;the impotence of legality&quot;, and said that he carried a copy of Meins&#x27;s autopsy photo as a reminder.

After the death of Holger Meins, around 5,000 people marched through the city in West Berlin despite a ban on demonstrations; there was a violent street battle with the police. 

At Mein&#x27;s funeral in Hamburg, Rudi Dutschke, among others. Dutschke promised at the open grave &quot;Holger, the fight continues!&quot;

The RAF members who carried out the West German Embassy siege in Stockholm in 1975 named their group the &quot;Holger Meins Commando&quot; in his honor.

==Representation in other media==
*Jean-Marie Straub&#x27;s and Danièle Huillet&#x27;s movie, &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; (1974), is dedicated to Meins. He had earlier been the directors&#x27; friend, working as a cameraman.
*&quot;Starbuck-Holger Meins&quot; (2002) is a documentary film about him by Gerd Conradt.

<doc id="419200" wikidata="Q898601" url="?curid=419200" title="Schrödinger picture">
<text>In physics, the Schrödinger picture or Schrödinger representation is a formulation of quantum mechanics in which the state vectors evolve in time, but the operators (observables and others) are mostly constant with respect to time (an exception is the Hamiltonian which may change if the potential formula_1 changes). This differs from the Heisenberg picture which keeps the states constant while the observables evolve in time, and from the interaction picture in which both the states and the observables evolve in time. The Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures are related as active and passive transformations and commutation relations between operators are preserved in the passage between the two pictures.

In the Schrödinger picture, the state of a system evolves with time. The evolution for a closed quantum system is brought about by a unitary operator, the time evolution operator. For time evolution from a state vector formula_2 at time 0 to a state vector formula_3 at time , the time-evolution operator is commonly written formula_4, and one has
:formula_5
In the case where the Hamiltonian of the system does not vary with time, the time-evolution operator has the form
:formula_6
where the exponent is evaluated via its Taylor series.

The Schrödinger picture is useful when dealing with a time-independent Hamiltonian ; that is, formula_7.

==Background==

In elementary quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum-mechanical system is represented by a complex-valued wavefunction . More abstractly, the state may be represented as a state vector, or &quot;ket&quot;, formula_8. This ket is an element of a &quot;Hilbert space&quot;, a vector space containing all possible states of the system. A quantum-mechanical operator is a function which takes a ket formula_8 and returns some other ket formula_10.

The differences between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics revolve around how to deal with systems that evolve in time: the time-dependent nature of the system &quot;must&quot; be carried by some combination of the state vectors and the operators. For example, a quantum harmonic oscillator may be in a state formula_8 for which the expectation value of the momentum, formula_12, oscillates sinusoidally in time. One can then ask whether this sinusoidal oscillation should be reflected in the state vector formula_8, the momentum operator formula_14, or both. All three of these choices are valid; the first gives the Schrödinger picture, the second the Heisenberg picture, and the third the interaction picture.

==The time evolution operator==

===Definition===

The time-evolution operator &quot;U&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;t&quot;0) is defined as the operator which acts on the ket at time &quot;t&quot;0 to produce the ket at some other time &quot;t&quot;:

:The time evolution operator must be unitary. For the norm of the state ket must not change with time. That is, formula_17 Therefore, formula_18
;&quot;Identity&quot;
:When &quot;t&quot; = &quot;t&quot;0, &quot;U&quot; is the identity operator, since formula_19

:Time evolution from &quot;t&quot;0 to &quot;t&quot; may be viewed as a two-step time evolution, first from &quot;t&quot;0 to an intermediate time &quot;t&quot;1, and then from &quot;t&quot;1 to the final time &quot;t&quot;. Therefore, formula_20

===Differential equation for time evolution operator===
We drop the &quot;t&quot;0 index in the time evolution operator with the convention that and write it as &quot;U&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). The Schrödinger equation is
formula_21
where &quot;H&quot; is the Hamiltonian. Now using the time-evolution operator &quot;U&quot; to write formula_22,
formula_23

Since formula_24 is a constant ket (the state ket at ), and since the above equation is true for any constant ket in the Hilbert space, the time evolution operator must obey the equation
formula_25

If the Hamiltonian is independent of time, the solution to the above equation is
formula_26

Since &quot;H&quot; is an operator, this exponential expression is to be evaluated via its Taylor series:
formula_27

Therefore,
formula_28

Note that formula_24 is an arbitrary ket. However, if the initial ket is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, with eigenvalue &quot;E&quot;:
formula_30

The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are &quot;stationary states&quot;: they only pick up an overall phase factor as they evolve with time.

If the Hamiltonian is dependent on time, but the Hamiltonians at different times commute, then the time evolution operator can be written as
formula_31

If the Hamiltonian is dependent on time, but the Hamiltonians at different times do not commute, then the time evolution operator can be written as
formula_32
where T is time-ordering operator, which is sometimes known as the Dyson series, after Freeman Dyson.

The alternative to the Schrödinger picture is to switch to a rotating reference frame, which is itself being rotated by the propagator. Since the undulatory rotation is now being assumed by the reference frame itself, an undisturbed state function appears to be truly static. This is the Heisenberg picture.

<doc id="419202" wikidata="Q2396633" url="?curid=419202" title="State ownership">
<text>State ownership, also called public ownership or government ownership, is the ownership of an industry, asset, property, or enterprise by the national government of a country or state, or a public body representing a community, as opposed to an individual or private party. Public ownership specifically refers to industries selling goods and services to consumers and differs from public goods and government services financed out of a government&#x27;s general budget. Public ownership can take place at the national, regional, local, or municipal levels of government; or can refer to non-governmental public ownership vested in autonomous public enterprises. Public ownership is one of the three major forms of property ownership, differentiated from private, collective/cooperative, and common ownership.

In market-based economies, state-owned assets are often managed and operated as joint-stock corporations with a government owning all or a controlling stake of the company&#x27;s shares. This form is often referred to as a state-owned enterprise. A state-owned enterprise might variously operate as a Nonprofit corporation, as it may not be required to generate a profit; as a commercial enterprise in competitive sectors; or as a natural monopoly. Governments may also use the profitable entities they own to support the general budget. The creation of a state-owned enterprise from other forms of public property is called corporatization.

In Soviet-type economies, state property was the dominant form of industry as property. The state held a monopoly on land and natural resources, and enterprises operated under the legal framework of a nominally planned economy, and thus according to different criteria than enterprises in market and mixed economies.

Nationalization is a process of transferring private or municipal assets to a central government or state entity. Municipalization is the process of transferring private or state assets to a municipal government.

== State-owned enterprise ==

A state-owned enterprise is a commercial enterprise owned by a government entity in a capitalist market or mixed economy. Reasons for state ownership of commercial enterprises are that the enterprise in question is a natural monopoly or because the government is promoting economic development and industrialization. State-owned enterprises may or may not be expected to operate in a broadly commercial manner and may or may not have monopolies in their areas of activity. The transformation of public entities and government agencies into government-owned corporations is sometimes a precursor to privatization.

State capitalist economies are capitalist market economies that have high degrees of government-owned businesses.

== Relation to socialism ==

Public ownership of the means of production is a subset of social ownership, which is the defining characteristic of a socialist economy. However, state ownership and nationalization by themselves are not socialist, as they can exist under a wide variety of different political and economic systems for a variety of different reasons. State ownership by itself does not imply social ownership where income rights belong to society as a whole. As such, state ownership is only one possible expression of public ownership, which itself is one variation of the broader concept of social ownership.

In the context of socialism, public ownership implies that the surplus product generated by publicly owned assets accrues to all of society in the form of a social dividend, as opposed to a distinct class of private capital owners. There is a wide variety of organizational forms for state-run industry, ranging from specialized technocratic management to direct workers&#x27; self-management. In traditional conceptions of non-market socialism, public ownership is a tool to consolidate the means of production as a precursor to the establishment of economic planning for the allocation of resources between organizations, as required by government or by the state.

State ownership is advocated as a form of social ownership for practical concerns, with the state being seen as the obvious candidate for owning and operating the means of production. Proponents assume that the state, as the representative of the public interest, would manage resources and production for the benefit of the public. As a form of social ownership, state ownership may be contrasted with cooperatives and common ownership. Socialist theories and political ideologies that favor state ownership of the means of production may be labelled state socialism.

State ownership was recognized by Friedrich Engels in &quot;Socialism: Utopian and Scientific&quot; as, by itself, not doing away with capitalism, including the process of capital accumulation and structure of wage labor. Engels argued that state ownership of commercial industry would represent the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and manufacture by the state.

Within the United Kingdom, public ownership is mostly associated with the Labour Party (a centre-left democratic socialist party), specifically due to the creation of Clause IV of the &quot;Labour Party Manifesto&quot; in 1918. &quot;Clause IV&quot; was written by Fabian Society member Sidney Webb.

== Public property ==

There is a distinction to be made between state ownership and public property. The former may refer to assets operated by a specific state institution or branch of government, used exclusively by that branch, such as a research laboratory. The latter refers to assets and resources owned by the population of a state which are mostly available to the entire public for use, such as a public park (see public space).

== Criticism ==
In neoclassical economic theory, the desirability of state ownership has been studied using contract theory. According to the property rights approach based on incomplete contracting (developed by Oliver Hart and his co-authors), ownership matters because it determines what happens in contingencies that were not considered in prevailing contracts.

The work by Hart, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) is the leading application of the property rights approach to the question whether state ownership or private ownership is desirable. In their model, the government and a private firm can invest to improve the quality of a public good and to reduce its production costs. It turns out that private ownership results in strong incentives to reduce costs, but it may also lead to poor quality. Hence, depending on the available investment technologies, there are situations in which state ownership is better. The Hart-Shleifer-Vishny theory has been extended in many directions. For instance, some authors have also considered mixed forms of private ownership and state ownership. In the Hart-Shleifer-Vishny model it is assumed that all parties have the same information, while Schmitz (2023) has studied an extension of their analysis allowing for asymmetric information. Moreover, the Hart-Shleifer-Vishny model assumes that the private party derives no utility from provision of the public good. Besley and Ghatak (2001) have shown that if the private party (a non-governmental organization) cares about the public good, then the party with the larger valuation of the public good should always be the owner, regardless of the parties&#x27; investment technologies.

More recently, some authors have shown that the investment technology also matters in the Besley-Ghatak framework if an investing party is indispensable or if there are bargaining frictions between the government and the private party.

The history of Esgueira remotes to the early medieval: the first document referring to the region dates to 1050. Specifically, the texts refer to the maritime waters of Esgueira. Outeiro was the locality where the first inhabitants settled.

There are several interpretations of the toponym. That proposed by Monsenhor João Gaspar stands out: Iscaria meant &quot;outeiro&quot;, a rocky elevation above Ribeira, the place where now stands the pavilion of Clube do Povo de Esgueira, formerly &quot;Parque do Outeiro&quot;.

Its geographic location, alongside tidal flats, permitted, until the 17th century, the development of the salt industry. An active centre in salt commerce, Esqueira was the seat of its jurisdiction (over thirty 31 towns and 10 municipalities). It received a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) in 1110 from the Count Henrique.

In 1116, the Monastery of Lorvão had possessions in the town, which the Afonso Henriques enlarged in 1176, with the donation of Taboeira, among others.

It was Sancho I that in October 1210, provided Esgueira to his daughter D. Teresa in his testament.

On 8 June 1515, a new foral was issued by Manuel I of Portugal.

During the reign of John III there was a reorganization of the territorial divisions of the kingdom, resulting in the establishment of new comarcas, including Esgueira on 20 December 1533. Between 1528 and 1836, Esgueira was a municipality, consisting of the parishes of Esgueira, Cacia, Nariz and Palhaça, whom, by 1801, included 4426 inhabitants.

With the elevation of Aveiro to city, the lands were converted into crown lands, after the Dukes implicated in the attempted assassination of Joseph I of Portugal were executed: the privileges of the Dukes were removed, and transferred by 6 November 1836 decree, extinguishing the municipality and annexxing Esgueira (as a simple parish) to the municipality of Aveiro.

==Geography==

The civil parish consists of various localities, including: Senhor do Álamo/Cruzeiro, Bairro do Vouga, Agras do Norte, Cabo Luís, Bela Vista, Taboeira, Quinta do Simão, Mataduços and Paço.

Esgueira has an annual population of approximately 3050 students, distributed among five kindergarten/primary schools (including &quot;EB1/JI Taboeira&quot;, &quot;EB1/JI Esgueira&quot;, &quot;EB1/JI Alumieira&quot;, &quot;EB1/JI Quinta do Simão&quot; and &quot;Cabo Luís/Bela Vista&quot;), one middle-school (&quot;Escola Básica 2º/3º Ciclos Aires Barbosa&quot;), and a secondary school (&quot;Escola Secundária Jaime Magalhães Lima&quot;).

While the community strives to establish a health centre, it is served by a health outpost on the ground floor of the municipal hall, in addition to a center for handicapped rehabilitation, medical clinics, two dental clinics, two pharmacies, a center for clinical analysis and centre for surgery.

<text>Ernest William Blythe (; 13 April 1889 – 23 February 1975) was an Irish journalist, managing director of the Abbey Theatre, and politician who served as Minister for Finance from 1923 to 1932, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1927 to 1932 and Minister for Local Government from 1922 to 1923. He was a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1934 to 1936. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Monaghan constituency from 1921 to 1933 and Member of Parliament (MP) for Monaghan North from 1918 to 1922.

==Early life==
Blythe was born to a Church of Ireland and unionist family in the townland of Magheraliskmisk, Maghaberry, County Antrim, in 1889. He was the son of James Blythe, a farmer, and Agnes Thompson. He was educated locally, at Maghaberry Cross Roads primary school. At the age of fifteen he started working as a clerk in the Department of Agriculture in Dublin.

Seán O&#x27;Casey invited Blythe to join the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which Blythe accepted. He was 18 at the time. He also joined Conradh na Gaeilge, where his first Irish teacher was Sinéad Flanagan, the future wife of Éamon de Valera. He was hesitant to join at first because he was an Ulster Protestant and was afraid he would be kicked out. He &quot;converted to Sinn Féin&quot; after reading the &#x27;Sinn Féin newspaper&#x27;.

==Early career==
In 1909, Blythe became a junior news reporter with the &quot;North Down Herald&quot; and stayed with the paper till 1913. During this period of his life he had dual membership of the Orange Order and the IRB. On 26 September 1910 Blythe joined the Newtownards Orange Order and remained in the Order until 14 February 1912.

To improve his knowledge of the Irish language, he went to the County Kerry Gaeltacht where he worked as an agricultural labourer to earn his keep.

He was at one point the &quot;centre&quot; or head of the Belfast IRB but was asked to step down by Bulmer Hobson and Denis McCullough so that McCullough could be promoted to a higher office.

During this time, he was the organizer for the Irish Volunteers in County Clare before 1916. His activity spread all over the south-west region to counties Kerry, Cork, Limerick and Clare. He became Captain of the Lipsole Company (of actors) and toured the region with a list of names of people to recruit. Blythe was one of the few organisers sent out into the country (others were Liam Mellows and Ernie O&#x27;Malley) and with little qualification was largely self-taught. Supplies were few and far between, as well as spasmodic. IRA GHQ were loth to commit scant resources. But Blythe was expected to drill, and train his men, as well avoid conscription.

Blythe was regularly arrested 1913-15 under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, when he was finally ordered to be deported from Ireland in July 1915: some of the others on the writ were Liam Mellows, Herbert Pim, and Denis McCullough. Blythe&#x27;s place was taken by Desmond Fitzgerald. He refused to transport to Britain so was sent to spend three months in Crumlin Road prison, Belfast. On 30 March 1916, a large crowd assembled outside the Mansion House in Dublin to protest against Blythe&#x27;s and Mellows&#x27;s deportation. Two policemen were shot at.

Thus, the authorities sent him to a town in Berkshire. He then failed to report to police and was sent to Oxford Prison, Blythe was unable to participate in the Easter Rising due to his imprisonment there. From Oxford, he was sent to Brixton Prison then transferred to Reading Prison. He was released at Christmas 1916, and was ordered never to return to Ireland. However, he returned to Belfast where he was later detained. He was later released and went to Skibbereen to edit the Southern Star which had been purchased by Sinn Féin. He ignored a (British Army) court martial to leave Munster, which resulted in a 12 months imprisonment in Dundalk and Belfast. During his time in Dundalk, he went on hunger strike for several days.

He married Anne McHugh in 1919.

==Political career==
===Revolutionary period===
Blythe first became involved in electoral politics in 1918 when Sinn Féin won the general election of 1918 and he became a TD for Monaghan North. He also served as the Minister for Trade and Commerce until 1922.

Blythe was implacably opposed to conscription. In an article entitled &#x27;Ruthless Warfare&#x27; he described conscription as an &quot;atrocity&quot;.
 We must decide that in our resistance we shall acknowledge no limit and no scruple ... [man who] assists directly or by connivance in this crime against us should be killed without mercy or hesitation... The man who serves on an exemption tribunal, the doctor who examines conscripts, the man who voluntarily surrenders when called for, the man who applies exemption, the man who drives a police car or assists in the transport of army supplies, must be shot or otherwise destroyed with the least possible delay.
The possibility of enforcing conscription alienated people across the island of Ireland from British policy in general. Instead a war of words emerged in which single issues, like conscription, would serve cohere to a general desire for Irish cultural identity and separation.

Awareness of religious differences was acute: for his part, Blythe noticed that there was a Catholic priest in the IRB. Being a moderate, Blythe was a strong supporter of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.

===Minister for Finance===
Consequently he became Minister for Finance in W. T. Cosgrave&#x27;s first government in 1923. Until 2014 when Heather Humphreys was appointed as a Minister, he was the &quot;only specifically northern protestant to have served at cabinet level in the 26 County state.&quot; He was also Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1922 to 1932 and Vice-President of the Executive Council.

Blythe was committed to keeping a balanced budget at all costs, which was not at all easy. The Irish Civil War had placed an enormous strain on the nascent Irish Free State, with public spending almost doubling during its course. As a result, Blythe was confronted with a projected budget of more than £8 million for the following year when the national debt already stood at £6 million. There was widespread criticism when he reduced old-age pensions from 10 shillings (50p) to 9 shillings (45p) a week in the June 1924 Old Age Pensions Act. This has long been popularly credited for the fall of the Cumann na nGaedheal government, although this would not occur for another nine years.

In 1926, as Minister for Finance, he introduced the Coinage Bill so that Ireland had &quot;a coinage distinctively our own, bearing the devices of this country.&quot; It was not until 12 December 1928 that the new coins, designed by Percy Metcalfe, were put into circulation. The delay was due to controversy over the animal designs chosen by the government-appointed committee, chaired by W. B. Yeats, set up to advise on the design of the coins.

Blythe funded the Shannon hydroelectric scheme during the late 1920s. Despite his austerity policies in relation to the old and the poor, Blythe readily funded pet projects; in just one year, 1929, his Department of Finance allocated £6,400 – a huge sum at the time – for translation into Irish of novels including Dracula by Bram Stoker. In 1930 he wrote in the Star whether &quot;the gods of democracy have not feet of clay ... the franchise in the hands of an ignorant and foolish populace is a menace to the country&quot;.

Cumann na nGaedheal had a very conservative economic policy at the start of the 1930s, seeing their role as running a tight financial ship, facilitating trade, and not intervening in the economy. Between 1929 and 1935, the last three years of his time as Finance Minister and the first three years of a Fianna Fáil government, Free State agricultural exports fell in value by almost 63% from 35 million pounds to 13.5 million pounds annually, and the state&#x27;s total export value to Britain fell from 43.5 million to 18 million pounds, another drop of over 50%.

===Into opposition, joining the Blueshirts===

At the 1933 general election, Blythe lost his seat. Shortly afterwards he participated in the formation of the Blueshirts. At an Army Comrades Association executive meeting in February 1933, he proposed that the colour blue be the colour of the uniform of the new organization. In April 1933, the ACA began wearing the distinctive blue shirt uniform. Blythe prepared the speeches of Blueshirt leader Eoin O&#x27;Duffy and participated in Blueshirt (now officially called the National Guard) meetings all over the country. He also cultivated fascist ideology within the Blueshirts, and envisaged the movement as an all-powerful &#x27;state within the state&#x27;. However, following an aborted attempt at a political parade in Dublin, the National Guard was banned. Cumann na nGaedheal and the National Centre Party merged to form a new party, Fine Gael, on 3 September 1933.

In January 1934, Blythe was elected to fill a vacancy in the Senate created by the death of Ellen Cuffe, Countess of Desart. He served in the Senate until the institution was abolished in 1936. He then retired from active political life. In the 1940s a fascist and anti-Semitic party called Ailtirí na hAiséirghe was formed, led by Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin, which Blythe supported. He had been a member of the Craobh na Aiséirghe branch of the Gaelic league which was the predecessor of the party. He advised Ó Cuinneagáin on the drafting of the party&#x27;s constitution, gave it backing in his journal &quot;The Leader&quot;, as well as making financial contributions. Blythe supported the idea of a one-party state stating it could fill the gap left in Irish society created by the destruction of the tanistry system.

During The Emergency in Ireland during World War II Blythe was of concern to the G2 whose intelligence files referred to him as a potential &quot;Irish Quisling&quot;.

==Abbey Theatre==
While Minister of Finance, Ernest Blythe granted a small annual subsidy to the Abbey Theatre. This made the Abbey Theatre the first state subsidised theatre in the English-speaking world. In 1935, from an invitation from W. B. Yeats, he became a director of the Abbey Theatre. Between 1941 and 1967 he served as managing director of the Abbey Theatre. He remained a director until 1972.

Blythe was highly criticised during his time as Managing Director. It was said that he rejected many good plays in favour of those which were more financially rewarding and ran the theatre into the ground as a creative force.

Upon criticism of Blythe only performing comedies, he replied: &quot;There is no reason, snobbery apart. Why, in their plays, dramatists should boycott ordinary dwellings. Most people in Ireland are the habituees of farmhouse kitchens, city tenements or middle-class sitting-rooms and their loves and hates, disappointments and triumphs, griefs and joys, are just as interesting and amusing, or as touching, as those of, shall we say alliteratively, denizens of ducal drawing-rooms, or boozers in denizened brothels&quot;.

Blythe brought to prominence several Irish dramatists. These included Brian Friel, Seamus Byrne, Micheal J. Mollow and Hugh Leonard.

It was through Blythe&#x27;s efforts that the new Abbey Theatre was built. He was responsible for raising £750,000 to rebuild the theatre which had been destroyed by fire on 18 July 1951. In August 1967, Blythe resigned as Managing Director of the Abbey Theatre. He remained as a member of the theatre board until 1972. He was also an active member of the Television Authority.

==Partition and later life==
In January 1922, during the Treaty Debates, he said that nationalists had the right to coerce the six counties of Ulster to be a part of a united Ireland. He added, however, &quot;as we pledged ourselves not to coerce them, it is as well that they should not have a threat of coercion above them all the time&quot;, while also believing there is &quot;no prospect of bringing about the unification of Ireland within any reasonable period of time by attacking the North East&quot;.

Blythe wrote a book &quot;Briseadh na Teorann&quot; (The smashing of the border) which was published in 1955. It was a revised account of the partition question regarding the divide between the North and South of Ireland. Blythe opposed coercion as a method of achieving a united Ireland: &quot;Partitionist practitioners of violence do more to keep Partition in being than the most extreme section of orangemen&quot;. He also challenged the republican belief regarding who was to blame for partition:;&quot;There would be twenty times for truth in describing partition as Ireland&#x27;s crime against herself than in describing it according to our propagandist formula as England&#x27;s crime against Ireland&quot;. This book did not earn much recognition, selling only 300-350 copies in the first four months, in part possibly because it was in Irish. One author, however, considers Blythe&#x27;s writings on the partition question both pioneering and influential.

Throughout his life Blythe was committed to the revival of the Irish language. He encouraged Micheál MacLiammóir and Hilton Edwards to found an Irish language theatre in Galway.

He published three volumes of autobiography: &quot;Trasna na Bóinne&quot; (1957), &quot;Slán le hUltaibh&quot; (1969) and &quot;Gaeil á Múscailt&quot; (1973).

Ernest Blythe died on 23 February 1975. His funeral service was held in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin.

==Influence on society==
Blythe saw his role in politics, as previously stated in this article, as having to keep the economy balanced at all times, this is why his name has &#x27;established a public notoriety far beyond&#x27; political circles. During his tenure, &#x27;taxation remained low as did spending&#x27;. Blythe&#x27;s subsidy to The Abbey Theatre influenced the performing arts in Irish society.

<text>Zwieback () is a form of rusk eaten in Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, North Macedonia, Poland, Scandinavia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey. It is a type of crisp, sweetened bread, made with eggs and baked twice. It originated in East Prussia. According to Fabian Scheidler, Albrecht von Wallenstein invented zwieback to feed his mercenary army during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Mennonites brought &quot;Zwieback&quot; to the Russian Empire; before the Russian Revolution, when many emigrated to the west, they brought &quot;Zwieback&quot; to Canada, the United States and other parts of the world.

There are two types of zwieback. One type is made by pinching round pieces of dough, placing one piece on top of another, pressing them together by pushing a finger down through both pieces. It is then baked and served as warm soft rolls. This type is identified with Mennonites.
The other type is a bread sliced before it is baked a second time, which produces crisp, brittle slices that closely resemble melba toast. &quot;Zwieback&quot; is commonly used to feed teething babies and as the first solid food for patients with an upset stomach.

The name comes from German &quot;zwei&quot; (&quot;two&quot;) or &quot;zwie&quot; (&quot;twi-&quot;), and &quot;backen&quot;, meaning &quot;to bake&quot;. &quot;Zwieback&quot; hence literally translates to &quot;twice-baked&quot;. The French and Italian names, respectively, &quot;biscotte&quot; and &quot;fette biscottate&quot; have the same origin, &quot;biscotto&quot; (biscuit), which also means twice (&quot;bis-&quot;) baked (-&quot;cotto&quot;). The Slovene name is &quot;prepečenec&quot; which would imply baked over ordinary or overbaked. The Serbo-Croatian name is &quot;dvopek&quot; which, again, is literally twice (&quot;dvo&quot;) baked (&quot;pek&quot;).

<text>Philip Jeremiah Schuyler (January 21, 1768 – February 21, 1835) was an American politician from New York. His siblings included Angelica Schuyler, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, and Margarita Schuyler Van Rensselaer.

==Life==
He was the son of Revolutionary War General Philip Schuyler (1733–1804) and Catherine Van Rensselaer (1734–1803). The Schuyler family were intermarried with other prominent New York families, including the Van Cortlandts and Livingstons, and his relatives included uncle Jeremiah Van Rensselaer. Alexander Hamilton, John Barker Church, and Stephen Van Rensselaer were all his brothers-in-law. He received his education through private tutors.

==Career==
Schuyler came to Rhinebeck in 1796 and in 1800 erected a mansion he called &quot;The Grove&quot;.
From there he managed farms and estates throughout upstate New York which were owned by his and his wife&#x27;s families. Schuyler served in the New York Militia and attained the rank of major before resigning in 1799. He returned to service with the War of 1812, during which he held the rank of colonel.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly, serving in the 21st New York State Legislature, representing Dutchess County, and in the 22nd New York State Legislature, representing Albany County. He was elected as a Federalist to the 15th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1817, to March 3, 1819.

==Personal life==

Schuyler married Sarah Rutsen (1770–1803), daughter of John Rutsen (1743–1771) and a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman, and inheritor of a large portion of the Beekman Patent, which encompassed much of what is now Dutchess County. Together, they had:

* Philip P. Schuyler (1789–1875), who married Rosanna Livingston
* Stephen Van Rensselaer Schuyler (1792–1859), who married Catherine Morris
* Catherine Schuyler (1793–1875), who married Samuel Jones (1770–1853)
* John Rutsen Schuyler (1796–1875)
* Robert Schuyler (1798–1855), who married Lucinda Wood (1807–1882), an 1817 graduate of Harvard and railroad speculator/embezzler.

After his first wife died, he married Mary Anna Sawyer (1786–1852) of Newburyport, Massachusetts. She was a daughter of Micajah Sawyer (1737–1817), a founding member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Sibyl Farnham (1747–1842). Together, they had:

* William Schuyler (1807–1829)
* Sybil Schuyler (1809–1813)
* George Lee Schuyler (1811–1890), who married Eliza Hamilton (1811–1863), daughter of James Hamilton. After her death, he married Eliza&#x27;s sister, Mary Morris Hamilton (1815–1877)

He died of tuberculosis, and was buried at New York Marble Cemetery. His remains were later moved to the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery.

His home, an estate he called &quot;The Grove&quot;, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

===Descendants===
Through his youngest son George, he was the grandfather of General Philip Schuyler (1836–1906). Schuyler was a prominent society figure who was featured in Ward McAllister&#x27;s famous The Four Hundred.

<doc id="419211" wikidata="Q518303" url="?curid=419211" title="1983 Beirut barracks bombings">
<text>On October 23, 1983, two truck bombs were detonated at buildings in Beirut, Lebanon, housing American and French service members of the Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF), a military peacekeeping operation during the Lebanese Civil War. The attack killed 307 people: 241 U.S. and 58 French military personnel, six civilians, and two attackers.

Early that Sunday morning, the first suicide bomber detonated a truck bomb at the building serving as a barracks for the 1st Battalion 8th Marines (Battalion Landing Team – BLT 1/8) of the 2nd Marine Division, killing 220 marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers, making this incident the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II and the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Armed Forces since the first day of the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War. Another 128 Americans were wounded in the blast. 13 later died of their injuries, and they are counted among the number who died. An elderly Lebanese man, a custodian/vendor who was known to work and sleep in his concession stand next to the building, was also killed in the first blast. The explosives used were later estimated to be equivalent to as much as of TNT.

Minutes later, a second suicide bomber struck the nine-story &quot;Drakkar&quot; building, a few kilometers away, where the French contingent was stationed. 55 paratroopers from the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment and three paratroopers of the 9th Parachute Chasseur Regiment were killed and 15 injured. It was the single worst French military loss since the end of the Algerian War. The wife and four children of a Lebanese janitor at the French building were also killed, and more than twenty other Lebanese civilians were injured.

A group called Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombings and said that the aim was to force the MNF out of Lebanon. According to Caspar Weinberger, then United States Secretary of Defense, there is no knowledge of who did the bombing. Some analysis highlights the role of Hezbollah and Iran, calling it &quot;an Iranian operation from top to bottom&quot;. There is no consensus on whether Hezbollah existed at the time of bombing. The attacks eventually led to the withdrawal of the international peacekeeping force from Lebanon, where they had been stationed following the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) withdrawal in the aftermath of Israel&#x27;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon.

===Mission===
On June 6, 1982, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation &quot;Peace for Galilee&quot; and invaded Lebanon in order to create a 40 km buffer zone between the PLO and Syrian forces in Lebanon and Israel. The Israeli invasion was tacitly approved by the U.S., and the U.S. provided overt military support to Israel in the form of arms and materiel. The U.S.&#x27; support for Israel&#x27;s invasion of Lebanon taken in conjunction with U.S. support for Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) alienated many.

Bachir Gemayel was the legally elected president, but he was a partisan Maronite Christian and covert associate of Israel. These factors served to disaffect the Lebanese Muslim and Druze communities. This animosity was made worse by the Phalangist, a right-wing, largely Maronite-Lebanese militia force closely associated with President Gemayel. The Phalangist militia was responsible for multiple, bloody attacks against the Muslim and Druze communities in Lebanon and for the 1982 atrocities committed in the PLO refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila by Lebanese Forces (LF), while the IDF provided security and looked on.

The Phalangist militia&#x27;s attacks on Sabra and Shatila were purportedly a response to the September 14, 1982, assassination of President-elect Bachir Gemayel. Amine Gemayel, Bachir&#x27;s brother, succeeded Bachir as the elected president of Lebanon, and Amine continued to represent and advance Maronite interests.

All of this, according to British foreign correspondent Robert Fisk, served to generate ill will against the MNF among Lebanese Muslims and especially among the Shiites living in the slums of West Beirut. Lebanese Muslims believed the MNF, and the Americans in particular, were unfairly siding with the Maronite Christians in their attempt to dominate Lebanon. As a result, this led to artillery, mortar, and small arms fire being directed at MNF peacekeepers by Muslim factions. Operating under the peacetime rules of engagement, MNF peacekeepers – primarily U.S. and French forces – used minimum use of force as possible in order to avoid compromising their neutral status. Until October 23, 1983, there were ten guidelines issued for each U.S. marine member of the MNF:

# When on post, mobile or foot patrol, keep loaded magazine in weapon, bolt closed, weapon on safe, no round in the chamber.
# Do not chamber a round unless instructed to do so by a commissioned officer unless you must act in immediate self-defense where deadly force is authorized.
# Keep ammo for crew-served weapons readily available but not loaded in the weapon. Weapons will be on safe at all times.
# Call local forces to assist in self-defense effort. Notify headquarters.
# Use only minimum degree of force to accomplish any mission.
# Stop the use of force when it is no longer needed to accomplish the mission.
# If you receive effective hostile fire, direct your fire at the source. If possible, use friendly snipers.
# Respect civilian property; do not attack it unless absolutely necessary to protect friendly forces.
# Protect innocent civilians from harm.
# Respect and protect recognized medical agencies such as Red Cross, Red Crescent, etc.

The perimeter guards at the U.S. Marine headquarters on the morning of October 23, 1983, were in full compliance with rules 1–3 and were unable to shoot fast enough to disable or stop the bomber (see Bombings: Sunday, October 23, 1983 below).

In 1982, the Islamic Republic of Iran established a base in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. From that base, Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) &quot;founded, financed, trained and equipped Hezbollah to operate as a proxy army&quot; for Iran. Some analysts believe the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran was heavily involved in the bomb attacks and that a major factor leading it to orchestrate the attacks on the barracks was America&#x27;s support for Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War and its extending of $2.5 billion in trade credit to Iraq while halting the shipments of arms to Iran.

A few weeks before the bombing, Iran warned that providing armaments to Iran&#x27;s enemies would provoke retaliatory punishment. On September 26, 1983, &quot;the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted an Iranian diplomatic communications message from the Iranian intelligence agency, the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS),&quot; to its ambassador, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, in Damascus. The message directed the ambassador to &quot;take spectacular action against the American Marines.&quot; The intercepted message, dated September 26, would not be passed to the Marines until October 26: three days after the bombing.

Much of what is now public knowledge of Iranian involvement, e.g., PETN purportedly supplied by Iran, the suicide bomber&#x27;s name and nationality, etc., in the bombings was not revealed to the public until the 2003 trial, &quot;Peterson, et al v. Islamic Republic, et al&quot;. Testimony by Admiral James &quot;Ace&quot; Lyon&#x27;s, U.S.N. (Ret), and FBI forensic explosive investigator Danny A. Defenbaugh, plus a deposition by a Hezbollah operative named Mahmoud (a pseudonym) were particularly revealing.

====Incidents====
On July 14, 1983, a Lebanese Armed Forces patrol was ambushed by Lebanese Druze militia elements and from July 15–17, Lebanese troops engaged the Shia Amal militia in Beirut over a dispute involving the eviction of Shiite squatters from a schoolhouse. At the same time, fighting in the Shuf between the LAF and Druze militia escalated sharply. On July 22, Beirut International Airport (BIA), the headquarters of the U.S. 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (24th MAU), was shelled with Druze mortar and artillery fire, wounding three U.S. marines and causing the temporary closure of the airport.

On July 23, Walid Jumblatt, leader of the predominantly Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), announced the formation of a Syrian-backed &quot;National Salvation Front&quot; opposed to the May 17 Agreement. In anticipation of an IDF withdrawal from the Alayh and Shuf districts, fighting between the Druze and LF and between the Druze and LAF, intensified during the month of August. Druze artillery closed the BIA between 10 and 16 August, and the Druze made explicit their opposition to LAF deployment in the Shuf. The LAF also clashed with the Amal militia in Beirut&#x27;s western and southern suburbs.

As the security situation deteriorated, US positions at BIA were subjected to increased fire. On August 10 and 11, an estimated thirty-five rounds of mortar and rocket fire landed on US positions, wounding one marine. On August 28, in response to constant mortar and rocket fire upon US positions, US peacekeepers returned fire for the first time. On the following day, US artillery silenced a Druze battery after two marines were killed in a mortar attack. On August 31, the LAF swept through the Shia neighborhood of West Beirut, establishing temporary control over the area.

On September 4, the IDF withdrew from the Alayh and Shuf Districts, falling back to the Awwali River. The LAF was not prepared to fill the void, moving instead to occupy the key junction at Khaldah, south of BIA. That same day, BIA was again shelled, killing two marines and wounding two others. No retaliation was given due to the ROE. As the LAF moved slowly eastward into the foothills of the Shuf, accounts of massacres, conducted by Christians and Druze alike, began to be reported.

On September 5, a Druze force, reportedly reinforced by PLO elements, routed the Christian LF militia at Bhamdun and all but eliminated the LF as a military factor in the Alayh District. This defeat obliged the LAF to occupy Souk El Gharb to avoid conceding all of the high ground overlooking BIA to the Druze. U.S. positions were again subjected to constant indirect fire attacks; consequently, counterbattery fire based on target acquisition radar data was employed. F-14 tactical airborne reconnaissance (TARPS) missions were conducted for the first time on September 7. On September 8, naval gunfire from offshore destroyers was employed for the first time in defense of the U.S. Marines.

On September 25, a ceasefire was instituted that same day and Beirut International Airport reopened five days later. On October 1, Walid Jumblatt announced a separate governmental administration for the Shuf and called for the mass defection of all Druze elements from the LAF. Nevertheless, on 14 October the leaders of Lebanon&#x27;s key factions agreed to conduct reconciliation talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Although the ceasefire officially held into mid-October, factional clashes intensified and sniper attacks on MNF contingents became commonplace. On October 19, four marines were wounded when a US convoy was attacked by a remotely detonated car bomb parked along the convoy route.

On October 16, thousands of Shia pilgrims were holding a procession celebrating Ashura in Nabatieh when an Israeli military convoy attempted to pass along the same road as the pilgrims. The Israelis, apparently unaware of the holiday or its significance, attempted to clear the road resulting in a confrontation which ended in an overturned jeep set alight, along with two transport trucks and stone pelting. The Israelis opened fire and tossed grenades resulting in at least two dead and fifteen wounded. This incident significantly increased tensions between the Shia community in Lebanon and Israel. This by extension, worsened increased tensions with the US.

==Bombings: Sunday, October 23, 1983==


At around 06:22, a 19-ton yellow Mercedes-Benz stake-bed truck drove to the Beirut International Airport. The 1st Battalion 8th Marines (BLT), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Larry Gerlach, was a subordinate element of the 24th MAU. The truck was not the water truck they had been expecting. Instead, it was a hijacked truck carrying explosives. The driver turned his truck onto an access road leading to the compound. He drove into and circled the parking lot, and then he accelerated to crash through a -high barrier of concertina wire separating the parking lot from the building. The wire popped &quot;like somebody walking on twigs.&quot;

The truck then passed between two sentry posts and through an open vehicle gate in the perimeter chain-link fence, crashed through a guard shack in front of the building and smashed into the lobby of the building serving as the barracks for the 1st Battalion 8th Marines (BLT). The sentries at the gate were operating under rules of engagement which made it very difficult to respond quickly to the truck. On the day of the bombing, the sentries were ordered to keep a loaded magazine inserted in their weapon, bolt closed, weapon on safe and no round in the chamber. Only one sentry, LCpl Eddie DiFranco, was able to chamber a round. However, by that time the truck was already crashing into the building&#x27;s entryway.
The suicide bomber, an Iranian national named Ismail Ascari, detonated his explosives, which were later estimated to be equivalent to approximately 12,000 pounds of TNT. The force of the explosion collapsed the four-story building into rubble, crushing to death 241 American servicemen. According to Eric Hammel in his history of the U.S. Marine landing force,
:The force of the explosion initially lifted the entire four-story structure, shearing the bases of the concrete support columns, each measuring fifteen feet in circumference and reinforced by numerous one-and-three-quarter-inch steel rods. The airborne building then fell in upon itself. A massive shock wave and ball of flaming gas was hurled in all directions.

The explosive mechanism was a gas-enhanced device consisting of compressed butane in canisters employed with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) to create a fuel-air explosive. The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that it probably would have brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.

Less than ten minutes later, a similar attack occurred against the barracks of the French 3rd Company of the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment, away in the Ramlet al Baida area of West Beirut. As the suicide bomber drove his pickup truck toward the &quot;Drakkar&quot; building, French paratroopers began shooting at the truck and its driver. It is believed that the driver was killed and the truck was immobilized and rolled to stop about from the building.

A few moments passed before the truck exploded, bringing down the nine-story building and killing 58 French paratroopers. It is believed that this bomb was detonated by remote control and that, though similarly constructed, it was smaller than and slightly less than half as powerful as the one used against the Marines. Many of the paratroopers had gathered on their balconies moments earlier to see what was happening at the airport. It was France&#x27;s worst military loss since the end of the Algerian War in 1962.

==Rescue and recovery operations: October 23 to 28, 1983==

===American===
Organized rescue efforts began immediately – within three minutes of the bombing – and continued for days. Unit maintenance personnel were not billeted in the BLT building, and they rounded up pry bars, torches, jacks and other equipment from unit vehicles and maintenance shops and began rescue operations. Meanwhile, combat engineers and truck drivers began using their organic assets, i.e., trucks and engineering equipment, to help with the rescue operations.

24th MAU medical personnel, Navy dentists LT Gil Bigelow and LT Jim Ware, established two aid stations to triage and treat casualties. Medevac helicopters, CH-46s from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM-162), were airborne by 6:45 AM. U.S. Navy medical personnel from nearby vessels of the U.S. Sixth Fleet went ashore to assist with treatment and medical evacuation of the injured, as did sailors and shipboard marines who volunteered to assist with the rescue effort. Lebanese, Italian, British, and even French troops, who had suffered their own loss, provided assistance.

Many Lebanese civilians voluntarily joined the rescue effort. Especially important was a Lebanese construction contractor, Rafiq Hariri of the firm Oger-Liban, who provided heavy construction equipment, e.g., a 40-ton P &amp; H crane, etc., from nearby BIA worksites. Hariri&#x27;s construction equipment proved vitally necessary in lifting and removing heavy slabs of concrete debris at the barracks site just as it had been necessary in assisting with clearing debris after the April U.S. Embassy attack.
While the rescuers were at times hindered by hostile sniper and artillery fire, several marine survivors were pulled from the rubble at the BLT 1/8 bomb site and airlifted by helicopter to the , located offshore. U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force medevac planes transported the seriously wounded to the hospital at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and to U.S. and German hospitals in West Germany. A few survivors, including Lt. Col. Gerlach, were sent to the Italian MNF dispensary and to Lebanese hospitals in Beirut. Israel&#x27;s offers to medevac the wounded to hospitals in Israel were rejected as politically unacceptable even though Israeli hospitals were known to provide excellent care and were considerably closer than hospitals in Germany.

At about noon Sunday, October 23, the last survivor was pulled from the rubble; he was LTJG Danny G. Wheeler, Lutheran chaplain for BLT 1/8. Other men survived beyond Sunday, but they succumbed to their injuries before they could be extracted from the rubble. By Wednesday, the majority of the bodies and body parts had been recovered from the stricken barracks, and the recovery effort ended on Friday. After five days, the FBI came in to investigate, and the Marines returned to normal duties.

===French===
&quot;The explosion at the French barracks blew the whole building off its foundations and threw it about 6 meters (20 feet) westward, while breaking the windows of almost every apartment house in the neighborhood ... Grim-faced French paratroopers and Lebanese civil-defense workers aided by bulldozers also worked under spotlights through the night at the French barracks, trying to pull apart the eight stories of 90 centimeter (3 foot) thick cement that had fallen on top of one another and to reach the men they could still hear screaming for help. They regularly pumped oxygen into the mountain of rubble to keep those who were still trapped below alive.&quot;

== Victims ==
The explosions resulted in 346 casualties, of which 234 (68%) were killed immediately, with head injuries, thoracic injuries and burns accounting for a large number of deaths.

The New York Times printed a list of the identified casualties on October 26, 1983. Another list of those who survived the incident was published by the Department of Defense. The information had to be re-printed, as individuals were misidentified, and family members were told incorrect statuses of their loved ones.

Twenty-one U.S. peacekeepers who lost their lives in the bombing were buried in Section 59 at Arlington National Cemetery, near one of the memorials to all the victims.

==American and French response==
U.S. President Ronald Reagan called the attack a &quot;despicable act&quot; and pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had privately advised the administration against stationing U.S. Marines in Lebanon, said there would be no change in the U.S.&#x27;s Lebanon policy. French President François Mitterrand and other French dignitaries visited both the French and American bomb sites to offer their personal condolences on Monday, October 24, 1983. It was not an official visit, and President Mitterrand only stayed for a few hours, but he did declare &quot;We will stay.&quot;

During his visit, President Mitterrand visited each of the scores of American caskets and made the sign of the cross as his mark of respectful observance for each of the fallen peacekeepers. U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush arrived and made a tour of the destroyed BLT barracks on Wednesday, October 26, 1983. Vice President Bush toured the site and said the U.S. &quot;would not be cowed by terrorists.&quot; Vice President Bush visited with wounded U.S. personnel aboard the U.S.S. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; (LPH-2), and he took time to meet with the commanders of the other MNF units, French, Italian and British, deployed in Beirut.

In retaliation for the attacks, France launched an airstrike in the Beqaa Valley against alleged Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) positions. President Reagan assembled his national security team and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, Lebanon, which housed Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) believed to be training Hezbollah militants. A joint American–French air assault on the camp where the bombing was planned was also approved by Reagan and Mitterrand. U.S. Defense Secretary Weinberger lobbied successfully against the mission, because at the time it was not certain that Iran was behind the attack.

Some of the U.S. Marines in Beirut were moved to transport vessels offshore where they could not be targeted; yet, they would be ready and available to serve as a ready reaction force in Beirut if needed. For protection against snipers and artillery attacks, the Marines remaining at the airport built, and moved into, bunkers in the ground employing &#x27;appropriated&#x27; Soviet-bloc CONEXes.

Col. Geraghty requested and received reinforcements to replace his unit losses. BLT 2/6, the Second Marine Division Air Alert Battalion stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and commanded by Col. Edwin C. Kelley, Jr., was dispatched and flown into Beirut by four C-141s in less than 36 hours after the bombing. Lt. Col. Kelley officially replaced the seriously injured BLT 1/8 commander, Lt. Col. Larry Gerlach. The entire Headquarters and Service Company and Weapons Company of BLT 2/6 was airlifted into Beirut, along with Company E (Reinforced). Lt. Col. Kelley quietly redesignated his unit, BLT 2/6, as BLT 1/8 to help bolster the morale of the BLT 1/8 survivors.

The BLT headquarters was relocated to a landfill area west of the airfield, and Company A (Reinforced) was repositioned from the university library position to serve as landing force reserve afloat, aboard Amphibious Ready Group shipping. On November 18, 1983, the 22d MAU rotated into Beirut and relieved in place the 24th MAU. The 24th MAU with Lt. Col. Kelley commanding BLT 1/8 returned to Camp Lejeune, NC, by sea for training and refitting.

Eventually, it became evident that the U.S. would launch no serious and immediate retaliatory attack for the Beirut Marine barracks bombing beyond naval barrages and air strikes used to interdict continuous harassing fire from Druze and Syrian missile and artillery sites. A true retaliatory strike failed to materialize because there was a rift in White House counsel, largely between George P. Shultz of the Department of State and Weinberger of the Department of Defense, and because the extant evidence pointing at Iranian involvement was circumstantial at that time: the Islamic Jihad, which took credit for the attack, was a front for Hezbollah which was acting as a proxy for Iran, affording Iran plausible deniability.

Secretary of State Shultz was an advocate for retaliation, but Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was against retaliation. Secretary of Defense Weinberger, in a September 2001 &quot;Frontline&quot; interview, reaffirmed that rift in White House counsel when he claimed that the U.S. still lacks &quot;&#x27;actual knowledge of who did the bombing&#x27; of the Marine barracks.&quot;

The had arrived and taken up station off Beirut on September 25, 1983. Special Representative in the Middle East Robert McFarlane&#x27;s team had requested &quot;New Jersey&quot; after the August 29th Druze mortar attack that killed two marines. After the October 23rd bombing, on November 28, the U.S. government announced that the &quot;New Jersey&quot; would remain stationed off Beirut although her crew would be rotated. On December 14, &quot;New Jersey&quot; fired 11 projectiles from her 16-inch guns at hostile targets near Beirut. &quot;This was the first time 16-inch shells were fired for effect anywhere in the world since the &quot;New Jersey&quot; ended her time on the gunline in Vietnam in 1969.&quot; Also in December 1983, U.S. aircraft from the and battle groups attacked Syrian targets in Lebanon, but this was ostensibly in response to Syrian missile attacks on American warplanes.

In the meantime, the attack boosted the prestige and growth of the Shi&#x27;ite organization Hezbollah. Hezbollah officially denied any involvement in the attacks, but was seen by many Lebanese as involved nonetheless as it praised the &quot;two martyr mujahideen&quot; who &quot;set out to inflict upon the U.S. Administration an utter defeat, not experienced since Vietnam.&quot; Hezbollah was now seen by many as &quot;the spearhead of the sacred Muslim struggle against foreign occupation&quot;.

The 1983 report of the U.S. Department of Defense Commission&#x27;s on the attack recommended that the National Security Council investigate and consider alternative ways to reach &quot;American objectives in Lebanon&quot; because, &quot;as progress to diplomatic solutions slows,&quot; the security of the USMNF base continues to &quot;deteriorate.&quot; The commission also recommended a review for the development of a broader range of &quot;appropriate military, political, and diplomatic responses to terrorism.&quot; Military preparedness needed improvement in the development of &quot;doctrine, planning, organization, force structure, education, and training&quot; to better combat terrorism, while the USMNF was &quot;not prepared&quot; to deal with the terrorist threat at the time due to &quot;lack of training, staff, organization, and support&quot; specifically for defending against &quot;terror threats.&quot;

Amal Movement leader Nabih Berri, who had previously supported U.S. mediation efforts, asked the U.S. and France to leave Lebanon and accused the two countries of seeking to commit &#x27;massacres&#x27; against the Lebanese and of creating a &quot;climate of racism&quot; against Shias. Islamic Jihad phoned in new threats against the MNF pledging that &quot;the earth would tremble&quot; unless the MNF withdrew by New Year&#x27;s Day 1984.
On February 7, 1984, President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawing from Lebanon largely because of waning congressional support for the mission after the attacks on the barracks. The withdrawal of the 22d MAU from the BIA was completed 12:37 PM on February 26, 1984. &quot;Fighting between the Lebanese Army and Druze militia in the nearby Shouf mountains provided a noisy backdrop to the Marine evacuation. One officer commented: &#x27;This ceasefire is getting louder.&#x27;&quot;

On February 8, 1984, the USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; fired almost 300 shells at Druze and Syrian positions in the Beqaa Valley east of Beirut. This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War. Firing without air spotting, the battleship had to rely on Israeli target intelligence. &quot;In a nine-hour period, the USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; fired 288 16-inch rounds, each one weighing as much as a Volkswagen Beetle. In those nine-hours, the ship consumed 40 percent of the 16-inch ammunition available in the entire European theater ... [and] in one burst of wretched excess,&quot; &quot;New Jersey&quot; seemed to be unleashing eighteen months of repressed fury.

&quot;Many Lebanese still recall the &#x27;flying Volkswagens,&#x27; the name given to the huge shells that struck the Shouf.&quot; In addition to destroying Syrian and Druze artillery and missile sites, approximately 30 of these behemoth projectiles rained down on a Syrian command post, killing the senior commanding Syrian general in Lebanon along with several of his senior officers.

Following the lead of the U.S., the rest of the multinational force, the British, French and Italians, was withdrawn by the end of February 1984. The ship-borne 22d MAU contingent remained stationed offshore near Beirut while a detached 100-man ready reaction force remained stationed ashore near the U.S./U.K. Embassy. The 22d MAU was relieved in place by the 24th MAU on April 10, 1984. On April 21, the ready reaction force in Beirut was deactivated and its men were reassigned to their respective ships. In late July 1984, the last marines from the 24th MAU, the U.S./U.K. Embassy guard detail, was withdrawn from Beirut.

Although the withdrawal of U.S. and French peacekeepers from Lebanon following the bombings has been widely cited as demonstrative of the efficacy of terrorism, Max Abrahms observes that the bombings targeted military personnel and as such are not consistent with the most widely accepted attempts to define terrorism, which emphasize deliberate violence against civilians. A 2019 study disputes that the bombings motivated the withdrawal of U.S. forces, arguing instead that the collapse of the Lebanese national army in February 1984 was the primary motivating factor behind the withdrawal.

==Aftermath==

===Search for perpetrators===
At the time of the bombing, an obscure group called the &quot;Islamic Jihad&quot; claimed responsibility for the attack. There were many in the U.S. government, such as Vice President Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, and National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who was formerly Reagan&#x27;s Mideast envoy, who believed Iran and/or Syria were/was responsible for the bombings. After some years of investigation, the U.S. government now believes that elements of what would eventually become Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, were responsible for these bombings as well as the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut earlier in April.

It is believed that Hezbollah used the name &quot;Islamic Jihad&quot; to remain anonymous. Hezbollah eventually announced its existence in 1985. This is while, according to President Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, &quot;We still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn&#x27;t then.&quot; Weinberger mentions lack of certainty about Syria or Iran&#x27;s involvement as the reason why America did not take any retaliatory actions against those states.

Hezbollah, Iran and Syria have continued to deny any involvement in any of the bombings. An Iranian group erected a monument in a cemetery in Tehran to commemorate the 1983 bombings and its &quot;martyrs&quot; in 2004. Lebanese author Hala Jaber claims that Iran and Syria helped organize the bombing which was run by two Lebanese Shia, Imad Mughniyeh and Mustafa Badreddine:

Imad Mughniyeh and Mustafa Badr Al Din took charge of the Syrian–Iranian backed operation. Mughniyeh had been a highly trained security man with the PLO&#x27;s Force 17 . . . Their mission was to gather information and details about the American embassy and draw up a plan that would guarantee the maximum impact and leave no trace of the perpetrator. Meetings were held at the Iranian embassy in Damascus. They were usually chaired by the ambassador, Hojatoleslam Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, who played an instrumental role in founding Hezbollah. In consultation with several senior Syrian intelligence officers, the final plan was set in motion. The vehicle and explosives were prepared in the Beqaa Valley which was under Syrian control.

Two years after the bombing, a U.S. grand jury secretly indicted Imad Mughniyah for terrorist activities. Mughniyah was never captured, but he was killed by a car bomb in Syria on February 12, 2008.

Commentators argue that the lack of a response by the Americans emboldened terrorist organizations to conduct further attacks against U.S. targets. Along with the U.S. embassy bombing, the barracks bombing prompted the Inman Report, a review of the security of U.S. facilities overseas for the U.S. State Department.

On October 10, 2017 the U.S. State Department added Fuad Shukr to its Rewards for Justice Program, stating that he played a central role in the bombings. Shukr was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on July 30, 2024. Ibrahim Aqil, who also had a bounty for the same reason, was killed in a separate Israeli airstrike on September 20, 2024. Both assassinations took place amid the Israel–Hezbollah conflict of 2023-2024.

===Alleged retaliation===
On March 8, 1985, a truck bomb blew up in Beirut, killing more than 80 people and injuring more than 200. The bomb detonated near the apartment block of Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a Shia cleric thought by many to be the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Although the U.S. did not engage in any direct military retaliation to the attack on the Beirut barracks, the 1985 bombing was widely believed by Fadlallah and his supporters to be the work of the United States; Sheikh Fadlallah stating that &quot;&#x27;They sent me a letter and I got the message,&#x27; and an enormous sign on the remains of one bombed building read: &#x27;Made in the U.S.A.&#x27;&quot; Robert Fisk also claims that CIA operatives planted the bomb and that evidence of this is found in an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspaper.

Journalist Robin Wright quotes articles in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; as saying that according to the CIA the &quot;Lebanese intelligence personnel and other foreigners had been undergoing CIA training&quot; but that &quot;this was not our [CIA] operation and it was nothing we planned or knew about.&quot; &quot;Alarmed U.S. officials subsequently canceled the covert training operation&quot; in Lebanon, according to Wright.

===Lessons learned===
Shortly after the barracks bombing, President Ronald Reagan appointed a military fact-finding committee headed by retired Admiral Robert L. J. Long to investigate the bombing. The commission&#x27;s report found senior military officials responsible for security lapses and blamed the military chain of command for the disaster. It suggested that there might have been many fewer deaths if the barracks guards had carried loaded weapons and a barrier more substantial than the barbed wire the bomber drove over easily. The commission also noted that the &quot;prevalent view&quot; among U.S. commanders was that there was a direct link between the navy shelling of the Muslims at Suq-al-Garb and the truck bomb attack.

Following the bombing and the realization that insurgents could deliver weapons of enormous yield with an ordinary truck or van, the presence of protective barriers (bollards) became common around critical government facilities in the United States and elsewhere, particularly Western civic targets situated overseas.

A 2009 article in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; titled &quot;Lesson Unlearned&quot; argues that the U.S. military intervention in the Lebanese Civil War has been downplayed or ignored in popular history – thus unlearned – and that lessons from Lebanon are &quot;unlearned&quot; as the U.S. militarily intervenes elsewhere in the world.

===Civil suit against Iran===

On October 3 and December 28, 2001, the families of the 241 U.S. peacekeepers who were killed as well as several injured survivors filed civil suits against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In their separate complaints, the families and survivors sought a judgment that Iran was responsible for the attack and relief in the form of damages (compensatory and punitive) for wrongful death and common-law claims for battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from an act of state-sponsored terrorism.

Iran, the defendant, was served with the two complaints, one from Deborah D. Peterson, Personal Representative of the Estate of James C. Knipple, et al., the other from Joseph and Marie Boulos, Personal Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey Joseph Boulos, on May 6 and July 17, 2002. Iran denied responsibility for the attack but did not file any response to the claims of the families. On December 18, 2002, Judge Royce C. Lamberth entered defaults against defendants in both cases.

On May 30, 2003, Lamberth found Iran legally responsible for providing Hezbollah with financial and logistical support that helped them carry out the attack. Lamberth concluded that the court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that Hezbollah was formed under the auspices of the Iranian government and was completely reliant on Iran in 1983, and that Hezbollah carried out the attack in conjunction with MOIS agents.

On September 7, 2007, Lamberth awarded $2,656,944,877 to the plaintiffs. The judgment was divided up among the victims; the largest award was $12 million to Larry Gerlach, who became a paraplegic as a result of a broken neck he suffered in the attack.

The attorney for the families of the victims uncovered some new information, including a U.S. National Security Agency intercept of a message sent from Iranian intelligence headquarters in Tehran to Hojjat ol-eslam Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, the Iranian ambassador in Damascus. As it was paraphrased by presiding U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth, &quot;The message directed the Iranian ambassador to contact Hussein Musawi, the leader of the terrorist group Islamic Amal, and to instruct him ... &#x27;to take a spectacular action against the United States Marines.&#x27;&quot;

Musawi&#x27;s Islamic Amal was a breakaway faction of the Amal Movement and an autonomous part of embryonic Hezbollah. According to Muhammad Sahimi, high-ranking US officials had a different interpretation from that intercept, which stopped them from ordering a revengeful attack against Iran.

In July 2012, federal Judge Royce Lamberth ordered Iran to pay more than $813m in damages and interest to the families of the 241 U.S. peacekeepers that were killed, writing in a ruling that Tehran had to be &quot;punished to the fullest extent legally possible... Iran is racking up quite a bill from its sponsorship of terrorism.&quot; In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that frozen assets of Iran&#x27;s Central Bank held in the U.S. could be used to pay the compensation to families of the victims.

===Mossad conspiracy theory===
Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his 1990 book &quot;By Way of Deception&quot;, has accused the Mossad of knowing the specific time and location of the bombing, but only gave general information to the Americans of the attack, information which was worthless. According to Ostrovsky, then Mossad head Nahum Admoni decided against giving the specific details to the Americans on the grounds that the Mossad&#x27;s responsibility was to protect Israel&#x27;s interests, not Americans. Admoni denied having any prior knowledge of the attack.

Benny Morris, in his review of Ostrovsky&#x27;s book, wrote that Ostrovsky was &quot;barely a case officer before he was fired; most of his (brief) time in the agency was spent as a trainee&quot; adding that due to compartmentalization &quot;he did not and could not have had much knowledge of then current Mossad operations, let alone operational history.&quot; Benny Morris wrote that the claim regarding the barracks was &quot;odd&quot; and an example of one of Ostrovsky&#x27;s &quot;wet&quot; stories which were &quot;mostly fabricated.&quot;

==Memorials and remembrance==


A Beirut Memorial has been established at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, and has been used as the site of annual memorial services for the victims of the attack. A Beirut Memorial Room at the USO in Jacksonville, North Carolina has also been created.

The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center, the site of Chaplain Corps training for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force at Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina, includes the partially destroyed sign from the Beirut barracks chapel as a memorial to those who died in the attack. According to Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, one of the navy chaplains present during the attack, &quot;Amidst the rubble, we found the plywood board which we had made for our &quot;Peace-keeping Chapel.&quot; The Chaplain Corps Seal had been hand-painted, with the words &quot;Peace-keeping&quot; above it, and &quot;Chapel&quot; beneath. Now &quot;Peace-keeping&quot; was legible, but the bottom of the plaque was destroyed, with only a few burned and splintered pieces of wood remaining. The idea of peace – above; the reality of war – below.&quot;

Other memorials to the victims of the Beirut barracks bombing have been erected in various locations within the U.S., including one at Penn&#x27;s Landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Boston, Massachusetts, and one in Florida. A Lebanese cedar has been planted in Arlington National Cemetery near the graves of some of the victims of the attack, in their memory. A plaque in the ground in front of the tree, dedicated in a ceremony on the first anniversary of the attack, reads: &quot;Let peace take root: This cedar of Lebanon tree grows in living memory of the Americans killed in the Beirut terrorist attack and all victims of terrorism around the world.&quot; The National Museum of the Marine Corps, in Quantico, Virginia, unveiled an exhibit in 2008 in memory of the attack and its victims.

One memorial to the attack is located outside the U.S., where Gilla Gerzon, the director of the Haifa, Israel USO during the time of the attack coordinated the creation of a memorial park that included 241 olive trees, one for each of the U.S. military personnel who died in the attack. The trees lead to an overpass on Mount Carmel looking toward Beirut.

In 2004 it was reported that an Iranian group called the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign had erected a monument, at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery in Tehran, to commemorate the 1983 bombings and its &quot;martyrs&quot;.

There is also an ongoing effort on the part of Beirut veterans and family members to convince the U.S. Postal Service and Citizens&#x27; Stamp Advisory Committee to create a stamp in memory of the victims of the attack, but the recommendation has not yet been approved. In the meantime, Beirut veterans have created a &quot;PC Postage&quot; commercially produced Beirut Memorial statue private vendor stamp (with or without the words &quot;They Came in Peace&quot;) that is approved for use as postage by the U.S. Postal Service.

Author and former Navy SEAL Jack Carr announced that he would be writing a book about the 1983 bombings, entitled &quot;Targeted&quot;, which is set for release in late 2024.

<text>Katyn ( ; ) is a rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) in Smolensky District of Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located approximately to the west of Smolensk, the administrative center of the oblast. The village had a population of 1,737 in 2007.

==Geography==
It is situated to the west of the city of Smolensk (about 18 km from its center) and circa 60 km from the Russian borders with Belarus. It has a station on the Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow international railway line.

==History==
Before World War I, Gnyozdovo with the Katyn Forest belonged to the Koźliński family. In the 19th century, Piotr Koźliński married Leokadia Lefftreu, the daughter of the director of the English railway construction company in Russia. Under the marriage articles Gniezdovo and Katyn became co-owned by the British.

===Katyn massacre===
The Katyn Forest, in the vicinity of the village, was the site of the Katyn massacre during World War II, in which thousands of captured Polish officers and other citizens were killed. On 5 March 1940, Stalin approved, together with Voroshilov, Mikoyan and Molotov, a proposal from Beria that led to the assassination of 21,857 Poles.

Despite claims by the Poles, the Soviet Union blamed Nazi Germany for the mass murders and attempted to hide its involvement, going as far as to ban all mention of the Katyn massacre in the USSR. In 1990, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. A number of earlier mass graves of victims of the Soviet system have also been found there, because Katyn Forest had long been used as an execution site for Soviet citizens.

The NKVD resolved to execute prisoners of war and &quot;members of various counter-revolutionary organisations, former landowners, factory owners, former Polish officers, officials and escapees&quot;. In 2004, Polish prosecutors described this as a plan to eliminate in part the &quot;intellectual elite of the Polish Nation&quot;, so as &quot;to prevent the rebirth of Polish statehood&quot;.

The 2007 Polish film &quot;Katyń&quot;, directed by Andrzej Wajda, is an interpretation of the events that led up to the mass execution.

==Climate==
Katyn has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).
